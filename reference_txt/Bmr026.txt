The meeting concerned mostly status updates and logistical affairs. The participants learned that the transcription status was good. The progress on the DARPA demo was also good, except the interface did not look as pretty as they had wanted to. The storage disks, which they had been waiting for, had finally arrived, but the person responsible for installing them was going on break. The participants also decided to schedule less meetings, so they have updates to report when they do. The meeting ended with technical discussion about model performance.
