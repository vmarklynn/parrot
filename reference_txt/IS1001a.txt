This meeting was primarily concerned with the design process and specific designing requirements of the remote control. Project Manager first introduced the goal of the new remote control project as to be original, trendy and user-friendly so as to bear an advantage over competitive products. Then three steps of the design process were respectively introduced and explained by Project Manager, and drawings of favourite animals then followed as an imagination-inspiring activity. According to Project Manager, the fifty-million-Euro financial objective of the project would be achieved at a production cost lower than 12.5 Euros and a twofold selling price. Competitiveness-endowing requirements for remote control design were then proposed and carefully discussed.
