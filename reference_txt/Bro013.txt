The meeting focused on the results from the existing model, speeding up the backend for feature direction, and a few tangential topics being developed for future exploration. The team was unsure why their model was not performing as well as they expected it to, and they suspected that their smaller dataset might be at fault. They also discussed how they could improve the performance of the backend model by improving feature detection. The meeting ended with some students sharing the tangential fields they were exploring and a brief discussion on the different pronunciations of zero.
