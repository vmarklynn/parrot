Project manager asked team members to present themselves. After that, project manager announced that the goal of the project was to design a new, trendy and user-friendly remote control, which would be sold all over the world. Project manager wanted to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro and expected profit would be around fifty million Euro. Then team members were asked to get used to the whiteboard by writing down their favourite animals. Besides, they were also asked to share their ideas and good or bad experiences about remote controls. From their point of view, remote controls with too many buttons or without backlight are hard to use. A potential-meter for volume control was also necessary. Remote control working with radio waves was better than that working with infra-red rays. At the end of the meeting, project manager had assigned tasks to team members.
