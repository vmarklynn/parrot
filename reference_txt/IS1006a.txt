The main points of the discussion are the design goal and price of a new television remote control project. The group first put forward the design goal of remote control. Then they got used to the whiteboard and wrote down everyone's favourite animal and their characteristics. Project manager and Marketing wanted to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro and expected profit will be around two million Euro. Then, the group thought about colour and function features of the new remote controls. In addition, they also believed that the remote control should be safe enough for children to use, and the appearance should be acceptable to them.
