The team mainly made some adjustments to the remote control design to meet the new project requirements. The second meeting started with Project Manager who briefly went over the last meeting. Industrial Designer hoped to minimize the size of the battery. The team thus decided on a rechargeable one. User Interface desired to simplify the remote control style, cutting down unnecessary functions. According to the market research presented by Marketing, the team agreed on a trendy and user-friendly flip-top design. An alarm would be incorporated for detection in case the remote control was lost in the house.
