This was the last meeting on the remote project. Industrial Designer and User Interface first gave the prototype presentation with a model remote they made based on previous team decisions, showing the design of colours, buttons, and shapes. Marketing then led the discussion on the evaluation criteria of their product, after which the team evaluated the remote in various aspects. As for finance, the team calculated the costs of each component of the remote, finding the total cost under their budget and thus allowing the remote to go into production. Finally, the team talked about their experience in the project process, digressing into a casual discussion on computers, cell phones, and ideas for commercials. The team members thanked each other for their effort.
