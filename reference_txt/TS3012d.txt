The discussion in this meeting focused on detailed design. First of all, the prototype was presented, which was pretty much like what the group had agreed before, including the yellow colour, cover and buttons made by rubber, etc. However, what they had exceeded their expected budget. Therefore, they had discussions on which features were okay to be taken out. They finally agreed on removing speech recognition, and the special colour. Then they did an evaluation of their product, and overall they did well. To sum up this teamwork experience, the Project Manager emphasized the importance of the communications. At last, they had a discussion on the product name, and agreed on "triple R".
