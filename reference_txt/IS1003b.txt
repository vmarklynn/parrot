This was a functional design meeting. Based on the presentations of the user interface designer, the industrial designer and the marketing expert, the project manager concluded that the new remote control should be powerful, easy to use, fashionable, recognizable, only for television and Internet-connected. After discussing the industrial design of the product, the group reached the agreement to design an infrared-based controller with less buttons but whether the product would be wireless was still unsolved. As for the product appearance, the group decided to make the product look fancy and recognizable; nevertheless, they had different opinions on the colour of the product.
