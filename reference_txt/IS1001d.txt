In the development of the project, this meeting was at the basis where a prototype of the product had been designed and it mainly focused on discussion about the cost and pricing of the product based on the material it used and the profit they wanted to obtain through this product. It turned out that the cost was very reasonable and the price was also very attractive. Then, the team evaluated the product by scoring according to criteria based on the user's requirements and marketing trends. The meeting went very well and every team member agreed with each other on the evaluation results, which was promising to lead a success in this project.
