The meeting mainly discussed the design of functions and the appearances. On function wise, the group had a little argument whether to make the product multi-functional or single functional. In the end they went with single-functional because it was more focused and affordable. They also removed some of the functions being discussed such as LCD screen, teletext and voice recognition, because they wanted to stick with a simplistic design. On design wise, the group finalized on the colour yellow as their product appearance and they chose illuminated buttons as one of their highlights. They also included some humanitarian factors into the design.
