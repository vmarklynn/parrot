The meeting participants discuss results from experiments and challenges that the model was facing. There was a significant server side delay, so they could not accommodate silence detection. Members noted that reducing model dimensions had a detrimental effect on model performance. The professor wanted to know the size of words that the word error rate was calculated on and explained that there would be no new training. From this point, they can start talking about future directions and work on fixing the system.
