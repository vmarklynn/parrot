The team was setting up a new project in which they would record meetings and then generate summaries. The meeting began with introductions and a discussion of what kind of data the team could collect. They considered collecting visual data as well as notes. At the end of the meetings, the team wanted to ask participants to summarize what they took away as well as ask questions about the meeting. This would be a method for collecting more data to train a potential summarization model. One concern the team had was how they could reduce bias when collecting queries. Words like "important" could skew participant responses. The team also expressed some interest in collecting action items. Finally, the team discussed what each member should do to get the project up and running and the role of diversity in their data set.
