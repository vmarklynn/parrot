The main topics of the agenda were a paper submitted to Eurospeech and the organising of the recording transcriptions to be done by IBM. The results presented in the former show a significant percentage of overlapping speech even without counting in backchanneling. Regarding the transcriptions to be carried out by IBM, the discussion mainly concerned the format of the recordings that should be sent to them. Suggestions included sending only the channels with the dominant speakers for transcription, but it was finally agreed on sending the original files with minimal modifications, as there will be extensive in-house post-processing.
