After Project Manager's brief review of the last meeting, Marketing began a presentation of the user requirements. It frustrated users most when they failed to find the lost remote control. The market research also revealed a necessity to simplify the remote control interface, for most buttons were not used. User Interface and Industrial Designer agreed on the intuitive interface design with menu navigation on an LCD screen and very few buttons involved. The new remote control would only be for basic functions such as volume adjusting and channel flipping. A separate joystick would be for additional functionality. The new remote control would be the integration of original remote controls for different devices. Voice recognition would not be feasible due to the budget limit. A speaker and a transmitter were desirable, however, for the location function.
