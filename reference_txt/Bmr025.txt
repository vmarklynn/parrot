The meeting discussed the progress of the transcription, the DARPA demos, tools to ensure meeting data quality, data standardization, backup tools, and collecting tangential meeting information. The team was making good progress on the transcription but was still concerned with correcting some of the data. Besides that, they were working on adapting the THISL GUI for their project and figuring out visual tools for meeting participants to help them know when their recording equipment was failing. The team also discussed collecting additional information, like laughter and breath data as well as meeting notes.
