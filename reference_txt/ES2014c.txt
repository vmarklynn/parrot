The project manager gave a brief review of the last meeting. After the Industrial Designer's presentation about the components of the remote and team's discussion about it, the team agreed that the kinetic power supply, simple push buttons and a simple circuit board and a finder feature are better choices for the remote. Then, the team discussed the design of the remote. They made the decision that standard rubber case and rubber buttons and a single curve are better choices for the remote, and the shape of buttons should be simple.
