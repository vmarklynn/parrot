As an extension to the previous discussion, this meeting basically dealt with the functional design of the remote control, for which User Interface, Marketing and Industrial Design respectively gave presentations on user requirement specification, subjects' main frustrations and expectations for remote controls and technical design. Subsequent to individual presentations, Project Manager then presented the new requirements from the management board, based on which the decisions on the needed functions of the remote control were made and the pre-arrangement of the next meeting was subsequently told.
