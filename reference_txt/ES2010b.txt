This was the functional design meeting, where the team discussed what functions should be included in the remote and how they should be carried out. User Interface gave a presentation on the design of the remote, offering a complex version and a simple one. Marketing followed with a presentation on the functional requirements of the remote, pointing out that the remote should be both high-tech looking and user-friendly, preferably with fewer buttons, a lost-and-found function and speech recognition. Industrial Designer then presented the working design for the remote, including its power source, chips and the component layout. The team then went into a further in-depth discussion, dealing with the specific points raised in the above presentations. After everyone had shared their ideas, Project Manager closed the meeting by distributing new tasks among the team members for them to work on until their next meeting.
