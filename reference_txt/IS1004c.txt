Project Manager started meeting on the conceptual design of the remote control. Marketing gave a presentation on the preference of users which was easy to use with a fancy look. Also, Marketing suggested the remote control to be the shape of cool fruits with fewer buttons because they should target the young user group that would be keen on new device innovation. Next, User Interface presented on the sample of sensor speaker but didn't recommend it because it didn't add too much functional design and it was not mature to use it as a speech recognition engine. The group agreed with User Interface to have two scroll wheels with turbo button and switch on button. Then, Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the component design. The group decided to use a power source with spongy design and double curve chip for easy handling. Lastly, Project Manager helped conclude the features on the upcoming prototype presentation and asked group mates to prepare individually on it.
