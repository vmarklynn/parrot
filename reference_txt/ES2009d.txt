This was the last meeting of their work. The meeting was about a summary of the previous achievements and agreements, including the details of the design of the remote control, like issues of energy source and budget control. After talking about their ideal remote control, the group moved on to plan their group presentation. They discussed what the PPT should include, what they should and should not mention in the presentation and also compared their work with their competitors.
