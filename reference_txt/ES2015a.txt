This was the first meeting on the team's project. It started with every member introducing themselves, getting to know each other's names as well as their individual roles in the project. Project Manager then revealed the overall plan for their project, announcing that they were going to design a new television remote that would be both trendy and user-friendly. After that, each person drew their favourite animals on the whiteboard and shared their reasons for the choice, with Project Manager choosing an elk, Industrial Designer a cat, User Interface a dog, and Marketing a butterfly. Project Manager then added some financial details to their plan, setting their selling price and cost. In the following brainstorming time, they raised ideas on night-time operation, a tracking device, and the design for buttons and shape. Finally, Project Manager arranged tasks for each team member to take on until their next meeting.
