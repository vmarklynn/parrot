The meeting was mainly about conceptual design. First, the marketing gave some opinions about product requirements based on market surveys and the group discussed some specific ways to fulfill them. After that, the user interface designer proposed to make a universal controller with speech recognition and a blinking thing. A list of basic components were also given. When it came to the cost control, the group believed that they should do some compromise to keep the cost under 12.5 Euros and the specific design scheme would be decided at the next meeting.
