The meeting occurred very close to the finalization of the Aurora model. The team discussed how various components of the model could be moved around to improve results. They had to decrease system latency as well to meet the Aurora requirements. The team thought that LPC could solve the problems they were having. The team also began discussing the Wall Street Journal data and task, which focused on speech recognition. The team was studying the task and learning from Mississippi State's existing model on how to perform better on it. Finally, the team discussed how they could histogram equalization as an alternative to some of the techniques they were using in their current models.
