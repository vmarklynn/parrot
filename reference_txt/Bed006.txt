Meeting participants began by going over the logistics of recruiting participants, particularly through departmental mailing lists. They then moved onto discussing a new role, the instructor, who would help experimental participants figure out their intentions. This would eliminate a pre-written set of goals for the participants. Participants also discussed how the schema would incorporate other information, like choosing movies, and how more complex actions, like that of purchasing goods, could be incorporated into the source-path-goal schema. Finally, the participants concluded that an SPG schema of a different kind, one that can transfer previously acquired information, may be more helpful. The meeting concluded with the discussion of a new meeting time.
