The meeting, which was held at the early stage of the project, focused on the product features and work division. Project manager proposed that the remote control had to be imaginative, trendy, user-friendly and international. Besides, the production cost should be no more than 12.5 Euros. In terms of the price, all members agreed that 25 Euros would be reasonable. They also clarified each person's duty. In the time remaining, the members did some tool training by drawing their favourite animals on the whiteboard.
