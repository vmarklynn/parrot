This is the third meeting of the design group. At first, Marketing revealed that ease of use, innovation and a fancy look and feel could be important to customers and the team discussed what colour and material they should use. Then Industrial Designer introduced three casing possibilities: uncurved, single-curved and double-curved. Next, the team talked about whether to use kinetic energy supply as an energy source. In terms of user interface controls, Industrial Designer proposed to add a scroll-wheel that could be integrated with buttons. Finally, the team summed up their decisions and Project Manager asked User Interface Designer to create a prototype next.
