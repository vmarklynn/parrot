First, the project manager briefly reviewed the last meeting. According to market research, Marketing suggested adopting modern appearance, reducing buttons, increasing positioning and voice recognition functions. From the perspective of technical function design, User Interface emphasized that the user should be the centre, reduce the buttons, focus on modifying the shape of the remote control, and do not waste the budget to design the universal remote controller. Industrial Designer had come up with the option of cheap and sustainable batteries, infrared lights and voice recognition technology. Industrial Designer also offered mouse-like scrolling and clicking functions, as well as specific remote control shapes.
