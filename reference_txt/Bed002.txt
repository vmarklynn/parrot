The meeting was about a computer based navigation system that will be used to conduct linguistic experiments on navigational terminology and intentionality, and it was simultaneously being recorded for another project. The navigational interface allows people to walk around a place and perform basic actions, like entering a building. Its goal is to understand what people intend to do based on granular linguistic features. The experimental set up is that people talk to a human assistant who controls the program in an attempt to complete a certain task. To study intentionality, the team will determine important linguistic features and use a Bayes model to see if they can predict the intention based on utterances.
