Project Manager introduced a new remote control project for television. At first, team members got their roles. Then they discussed what had to be done to design a remote control which had different features. Priority will be given to the functions. For example, team members hoped that users could choose what they want not by channels but by contents. To implement the functions, they discussed a lot, such as speech recognition interface and navigation buttons.
