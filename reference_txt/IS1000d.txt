Firstly, Industrial Designer introduced both the cheap one and the other, the expensive prototype of remote control based on the previous discussion of its function. Both the devices had the special shape, like the surf-board. The first prototype was a pretty simple design with LCD display and a conventional layout of buttons. The second prototype was advanced in its speech recognition function and looked like a fashion mobile phone. Secondly, Marketing designed an evaluation test, focusing on its look and feel, innovation and ease of use and the team were asked to give one to seven points to each feature of the product to compare the two prototypes. Thirdly, the team calculated the cost of both the prototypes and found that the second one had exceeded the budget to a great extent. As a result they discussed and voted a lot to discard the advanced functions and eliminate the number of the push buttons, which made the budget under control.
