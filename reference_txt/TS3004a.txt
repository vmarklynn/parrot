The meeting began with the Project Manager announcing the task and the agenda. The group should design an original, trendy, and user-friendly remote control through the following meetings. First of all, they did a brief equipment testing on their laptops, the pens, and the whiteboard to ensure they would work. Then getting to the main point of this meeting, the group talked about the budget and reached the agreement that it had to be a universal remote control with such a high price. The group also discussed the functions, the shape and other external design of the remote design, as well as drawing them down as a conceptual draft.
