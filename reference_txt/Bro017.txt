The meeting focused on the Aurora project. The Professor began with some updates on how certain decisions made by those leading the project did not make sense. There was some confusion and debate about how to move forward. The team then moved onto a discussion about measuring the effect of a given feature on the model. The professor outlined the specific methodology. At the time, the team was focused on testing for C-zero and C-one only, but they decided to expand their testing. Finally, the professor told some stories to explain future directions and the team had a brief discussion about their hardware.
