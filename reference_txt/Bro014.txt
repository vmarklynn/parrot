The meeting began with an update on the HTK backend. The team was testing different numbers for Gaussian mixtures. The team then discussed how performance on the Aurora tasks was measured. The final score for Aurora was a weighted average, but it seemed that there was no practical implementation against which tasks were being measured. The VAD of the team's existing system for Aurora was better. The team was also working on feature classification, mainly to do voice-unvoice detection. The meeting concluded with a few more updates on the Aurora project.
