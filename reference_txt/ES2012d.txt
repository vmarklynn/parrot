This is the last meeting of the design group. At first, Industrial Designer introduced the remote control prototype to the group. It included buttons for channel change, power, menu and also had a slider for volume, an infra-red section and a microphone. The cover was interchangeable with a company logo on it. It was also made of a rubbery material and could stretch over. Then Project Manager went through the costs of various aspects of design and argued that a slight compromise could be made as the remote control would be a fashion accessory and have interchangeable covers. After that, Marketing specifically summed up the evaluation criteria of remote control. Finally, Project Manager concluded and praised the teamwork results.
