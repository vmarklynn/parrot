This is the fourth meeting. Project Manager began a detailed design meeting with Industrial Designer and User Interface's overall design presentation. Industrial Designer and User Interface introduced the remote control was green with a light-blue screen of LCD, scroll and microphone function and the RR logo. Marketing put up a questionnaire so group members discussed and evaluated remote design. The final average score was two. Then the group calculated production cost. After calculation, the production cost was eighteen fifty and surpassed the company's budget. So the design was changed and functions such as scroll and microphone were lost to satisfy the budget. The group evaluated the project and gave some suggestions about the whole process.
