            " I think it's already produced a PowerPoint version. I think it's already done, actually. Go ahead and listen, work. I'll put it in the back. Okay, right. Okay. Right. Well, that's the kickoff meeting for our project. And this is just what we're going to be doing over the next 25 minutes. So, first of all, just to kind of make sure that we all know each other. I'm Laura and I'm the project manager. Great. Do you want to introduce yourself again? I'm David and I'm supposed to be a industrial designer. Okay. I'm Andrew and I'm a marketing expert. I'm Greg and I'm a hugeurant face. Great. Okay. So we're designing a new remote control. And I have to record he's here, actually. So that's David, Andrew and Craig, isn't it? And you're alive, don't you? Yes, we designed a new remote control. As you can see, it's supposed to be original, trendy and user-friendly. So that's kind of our brief. And so there are three different stages to the design. I'm not really sure what you guys have already received in your emails. What did you get? I just got the project announcement. Yeah, it's that one. So everybody got, okay. So we're going to have individual work and then a meeting about it. And repeat that process three times. And at this point, you get to try out the whiteboard over there. So you get to draw your favorite animal and sum up your favorite characteristics of it. So who would like to go first? Very good. All right. This one here, right? All right. My favorite animal is like... A beagle. And... The favorite characteristics of it? Is that right? Yeah. All right. Well, basically, high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family. And, yeah, they have lots of personality and be fit and robust good health. So this is blue beagle. I say my is beagle. Right? Lovely. Well, my favorite animal would be a monkey. And then the small cute and furry. And when plant needs to become real, they're not. And when they're up, they're with them. Right? Just a cute. You can take as long as this is you like because we haven't got an awful lot to this business. I call it a day. We do. Don't feel like you're in a rush anyway. I could tell you a whole lot more about beagles. I could tell you. I would have to get you up again. I don't know. Mine isn't going to have to think of the spot. Impressionist. Is that a whale? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my. I don't know. It's just the first animal I can think of to the top of my head. The big reason is because I'm allergic to most animals. I'm allergic to animal food. Fish was natural. Yeah. And I kind of like wheels. I'm coming in the middle. Everything inside. I'm going to be harmless and mild and interesting. I still don't know what I'm going to write about. Superbscatch, by the way. I was going to choose a dog as well. But I just saw a different kind of dog. My favorite animal is my dog at home. That doesn't really look like him actually. He looks like when I can pick actually. I see a dog in there. Yeah. Now I see a rooster. What kind is it? He's a mixture of various things. What did I put him? That's just a guess that his tail works. He's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you. He's kind of affectionate and he's quite wee as well. So he doesn't take up too much space. And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail. This is quite amusing. Is he aware that this is his own tail that he's chasing? It is. I think it is. He only does it after he's had his dinner. All of a sudden, he's get up and start chasing his tail. He's around to the room. Probably when he was little, he got lots of attention for doing it. Maybe. It's forever been conditioned. Maybe. Where did you find this just down here? Maybe doing the next. I need to discuss the project finance. According to the brief, we're going to be selling this remote control for 25 euro. We're aiming to make 50 million euro. We're going to be selling this one at international scale. We don't want it to cost any more than 12-50 euro. We're going to be selling it to 50 percent of the selling price. Can we just go over that again? Sure. So, basically. All right. So, production cost is 12-50. But selling price is that wholesale or retail, like on the shelf? I don't know. I imagine that's a good question. Our sale. I imagine it probably is our sale, actually, because it's probably up to the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want. But I don't know. I mean, do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on highly designed at all? Yes. I think it will. Well, right away, I'm wondering if there's, like, the DVD players, if there are zones. Oh, yeah. Regents and stuff. Frequency is something. Yeah. Okay. As well as characters, different keypad styles and simply. Yeah. But for a remote control, do you think that would be, what's positive depends on how complicated our remote control is? It doesn't make sense when you've been designed to be a case. You have more complicated characters than you are. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then the other thing international is on the top of the price. I'm thinking the price might appeal to a certain market in one region, whereas in another, it'll be different. Just like in terms of the world in the country, like how much money people have this band on. Or just like basic product positioning. The 25-year-old remote control might be a big hit in London. Might not be such a big hit in Greece. You know. I don't know how to say it too. Yeah. I should be writing all this time. Right away, I'm making some kind of assumptions about what information we're given here. Making Ktrendi probably means something other than just basic. Yeah. Something other than just standard. So I'm wondering right away, selling 25 years is that sort of that? Is this going to be like the premium product? Yeah, yeah, like how much does a remote control cost? Well, 25-year-old, I mean, that's about like 18 pounds or something, doesn't it? Or is it as much as that? 16, 17, 18 pounds. Yeah, definitely. I don't know. I've never bought a remote control, so I don't know how good a remote control that would get you. But yeah, it's because it has to look kind of cool gimmicky. Okay. You just scoot on the head here. Okay. Well, does anybody have anything to add to the finance issue at all? Do we have any other background information on how that compares to other? Yeah, actually, that would be useful, wouldn't it, if you knew what your money would get you? No. Okay. Yeah, interesting thing about discussing production of remote control for me is that as you point out, I just don't think remote control is being something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits. Yeah. It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something. Just five minutes to end of meeting. You know what I mean? Like, how do you... I mean, one way to look at it would be well, the people producing television sets, maybe they have to buy remote controls. Another way is maybe people who have TV sets are really fed up with their remote control. And they really want a better one or something. I'm not here in China and I'm buying the remote controls because they're fed up by having four or five different remote controls. Right. The panel was just... how many devices is it can go? Right, so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses. Right, so do you think that should be like a man designing a remote control? I think so. Do your satellite and your regular tally and your VCR and everything? Well, like maybe what we could use as a sort of example of a successful other piece of technology is palm pilots. They're going from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras, MP3 players, telephones, everything agenda. So like I wonder if we might add something new to the remote control market, such as the lighting in your house or... Or even like you know, notes about what you want to watch, like you might put in there or I want to watch that in touch and look at it. And that's a good idea. So extra functionality. Personally for me at home I've combined the audio video of my television set and my DVD player and my CD player. So they all work actually function together but I have different remote controls for each of them. So it's sort of ironic that they're in there. You know, the sound and everything, it's just one system. But each one's got its own little... Right. Okay. I'm going to have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes. I'll just check with nothing else. Okay. So anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used, what they would really like to be part of this new one. It's all... You keep losing them. You keep losing them, okay? You get these ones where you can... If you like whistle or make really high pitched noise they beep. Is that something we'd want to include, do you think? I'm sure. Okay. I remember when the first remote control my family had was on a cable. Actually the cable between the TV and big buttons that sort of like on a blender or something. I can't really describe it. And you know, and I think about what they are now, it's better, but actually it's still kind of, I don't know, like a massive junky thing on the table. Still pretty quick. Maybe we could think about how it could be more streamlined. Maybe like a touchscreen or something. Something like that. Or whatever would be technologically reasonable. Uh-huh. Okay. It could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better, but that just the appeal of... It's better. I've not having, you know, these days, every... people things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic, you know? Yeah. Um, nicer material than... Okay. Might be. Okay. The work's exploring. Right. Well, um, so we just to wrap up. The next meeting is going to be in 30 minutes, so that's about, um, about 10 to 12 by my watch. Um, so, in between nine then, um, as the industrial designer, you're going to be working on... You know, you're actually working design of it, so you know, you're doing there. Um, for our user interface, technical functions, I guess, that's, you know, like what we've been talking about. What it'll actually do. And, um, marketing executive, you know, be just thinking about what it actually, what, you know, what requirements it has to fulfill. And we'll get instructions emailed to you, I guess. Okay. Um, yeah, so it's the functional design stage is next. Yes. And, um, in that scene did you meet him? So I got that little message. I've locked the scene as my thought I would. Before we wrap up just to make sure we're all on the same page here. Um, do we, we're given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something, right? Well, um, are we right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television? Or are we keeping sort of like a design commitment to television features? Okay, well, just very quickly because it's supposed to finish. No, I guess that's up to us. I mean, you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it. Okay. So, um, you know, Okay. Yeah. The cap there. Okay. Depends on how much you can climb into that pipe. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Well, that's the end of meeting them. Um, thank you all for coming. Could I hit that with what they wanted us to do? Um, right. How do you turn this thing off? Is it function and, uh, there we go. I think if you can just leave it on maybe and then, um, oh god, this is turned itself off. Oh, oh, okay. All right. I think I'll very much like that. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.\n"
