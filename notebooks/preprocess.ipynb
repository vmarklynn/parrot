      "SPEAKER_04: So Morgan want make hard . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: It n't . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: I n't even check yesterday I started . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I n't know n't like low-three . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: You know , I discovered something yesterday wireless one . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: You tell 's picking breath noise stuff . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Yeah , little indicator AAF . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: So breathe , breathe see AAF go , know . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: Pick mouth nice . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Oh , 's good . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Because lot test . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: In fact , listen channel people talk , 's like \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: What see , Hannibal , recently ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: It 's disconquering . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Okay . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So I going try get half hour . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Because I really appreciate people coming . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And main thing I going ask people help today give input kind database format use starting link thing like word transcript annotation word transcript . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So anything transcriber discourse coder would ever put signal time mark word phone boundary stuff get forced alignment recognizer . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So , I think starting point clearly channelized output Dave Galbert 's program , Don brought copy . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Yeah , I 'm familiar . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I mean , I sort already developed XML format sort stuff . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And question sort thing want use . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Have looked ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I mean , I web page . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So I actually mostly need able link . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: I mean , 's question represent . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: I guess I going standing drawing . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Okay , yeah , definitely . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So definitely concept . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So single timeline . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And lot different section , IDs attached . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And refer section IDs want . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So start timeline tag . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Timeline . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And bunch time . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I n't remember exactly notation . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Oh , I remember . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Right . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Yeah , equal one point three two . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And I also optional thing like accuracy . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And ID equal one . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And I also wanted able specify specifically time stamp . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So arbitrary assigned program , user . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And whole bunch . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And somewhere might something like utterance tag , start equal 17 equal 18 . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So 's saying know start particular time . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: We n't know end . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Okay . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Right . But end 18 , may somewhere else . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: We say 's another utterance . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: We n't know time actually , know 's time end time . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Yeah , whatever want . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So 're specifically defining lot u ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Yes , exactly . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And also IDs . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Right . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So could sort tag later file . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: That would something like , , I n't know . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Noise type equal dorslam . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And could either say time equal particular time mark , could sort reference . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So , might prosody . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Prosody , right ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: D , . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: It 's O instead I , D good . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: You like D ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: It 's good D . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: You know , could sort type . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And could utterance 's referring could U 17 something like . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Okay , I mean , seems great encoding thing time \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: I guess question , , say , forced alignment ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: We 've got phone label . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And conceptually , get transcription word staying , time boundary changing 've got new recognition output . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Sort 's sequence going waveform stay , transcript may may change . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And utterance , time boundary may may change . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: That 's actually nicely handled could , could , 'd change time stamp timeline without \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: propagate . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: That 's extra level indirection , change timeline . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Except timeline going huge . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Yes . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Yeah , especially phone level . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: We phone level back . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Yeah , I n't think I would phone level . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I think phone level , want use sort binary representation 'll dense otherwise . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Okay , sort companion thing get called phone level , would look like ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I would use existing way . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: It 's matter bigger . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: But , know , barring memory limitation , I mean still \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: It 's parsing limitation . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I n't want text file read whole thing something simple . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Oh , would use purpose actually want phone level information . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So could file configures much information want XML something . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I mean , I imagine 'd multiple version depending information want . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: What I 'm wondering whether I think word level , would okay . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: For word level , 's right . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: For lower word level , 're talking much data I n't know . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I n't know \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: I mean , actually one thing Donna \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Gladeth big key . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: We 're running every frame get pitch value , one pitch value , different kind pitch value . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Yeah , I mean , something like , I would use p-file frame level stuff I would use p-file . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Meaning ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Well , something like . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: It 's 's 's 's 's 's 's 's format frame level representation feature . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Okay . That could call would tie representation like ID . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Or 's particular way XML refer external resource . \n",
      "None: Okay . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So would say refer external file . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So external file would n't \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: But 's advantage versus putting format ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: More compact , I think better . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I mean , \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: You n't want . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Anything frame level , better encode binary 's going really painful . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Or I mean , I like text format . You always \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Jesus , . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: And know , decompress fly space really \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: I thinking advantage share one frame . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: You 're talking gigabyte-sized file . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: You 're going actually run space file system one file . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Right ? Because two gigabyte limit OSs . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: I would say , okay , frame level probably good idea . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: But phone level stuff , 's perfectly like phone syllable \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Well , 're every five frame though . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So something like . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: But frame actually speech . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So , know , people n't \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Yeah , actually \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Look average number phone English word \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: I n't know , five maybe . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So look . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Number word time five . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So mean , pause phone take lot long pause phone ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Yeah , exactly . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Okay , 's true , keep . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So I think 's debatable whether want phone level thing . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Okay . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: But I think anything frame level , even P file true . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So I would use something tighter P file . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Are familiar ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: I n't seen particular format . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: I 've used . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: I n't know structure . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: But I mean , P file frame storing vector capstroller , PLP value , right ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: It 's whatever want , right ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Actually , 's nice P file , built concept frame , utterance , sentence , sort thing , structure . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And also attached arbitrary vector value . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Oh . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And take different type . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So n't float . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: You know , integer double sort stuff . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: That sound I \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Right , header , header format describes extent . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So problem 's actually storing utterance number frame number file , even though 're always sequential . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And waste lot space . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: But 's still lot tighter ASCII . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And lot tool already deal . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Do okay . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Is documentation \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Yeah , 's ton . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Man page source code \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I mean , sound good . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: I looking something \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Not database person , something sort standard enough \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: You know , start using , give . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Other people work . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Yeah , 's standard . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I mean , 's something developed ICSI . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: But \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: But 's used . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: But 's used \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And , know , well-configured system distribute free . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: And \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: I mean , must equivalent whatever guy use store computed feature , right ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Yeah , actually , use generalization sphere format . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: But \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Yeah , 's something like . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: But 's \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I think word HTK-DU feature . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Or even concept feature ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: I mean , topic feature format . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: It 's called like SSD something like . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Yeah , I 'm wondering , would worthwhile use instead ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Yeah , exactly good decision . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: And people n't typically share kind stuff , right ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: I mean , generate . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Yeah . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Actually , I \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: You know , 've done stuff prasadix . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And three four place I 've asked prasadic file . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And ASCII . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: All right . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: But frame frame , fine . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: But get unwieldy go query file really huge file . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Right . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And could . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: I thinking 's something \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And , \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: We 're frame value , right ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: If two-hour long meeting , 's gon na \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: They 're quite large . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Yeah , I mean , 're much enormous . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: These 10-minute switchboard conversation . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Right . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So 's doable . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: It 's store feature vector frame frame . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And n't kind \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: Is sharing part pretty important consideration ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: Or sort nice thing ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: I n't know enough 're gon na data . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: But I thought would good get something people use adopt kind encoding . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And make decision . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And especially prosody work , end get feature signal . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And course , change every time alignment change . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So rerun recognize want recompute feature keep database date . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: You change word change utterance boundary segment , gon na happen lot . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And I wanted something done elegant way . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And somebody want try something compute something else , done flexibly , n't pretty . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: It easy use . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Yeah , thing look Atlas , NIST thing , see anything level . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I mean , I 'm sure Atlas chose different route . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I chose something sort two choice . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Your file format know , know 're talking language speech , I chose time , file format graph representation . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And application impose structure top . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So looked like Atlas chose chose way , file format node link . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And interpret mean . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And choose ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Because I knew speech I thought better 're looking raw file tag say 's utterance , opposed tag say 's link . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: But , compatible ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: I mean , could sort \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Yeah , 're reasonably compatible . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: You could probably translate . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Yeah , 's \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So , well , thing , choose use Atlas , maybe , throw invest lot time . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So meeting , sort , \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Because need come database like work . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And I actually n't care long 's something useful people choose . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So maybe 's \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: You know , idea choose I n't \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Yeah . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I mean , I chose couple reason . One 's easy parse . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: You n't need full XML parser . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: It 's easy write purl script parse . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: As long tag one line \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Exactly , exactly , I always . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And much information tag want , right ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Well , I structured , right ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So tag particular item take . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: But add structure \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: If information . So would say instead , would say something like link \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Start equal node ID \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And equal node ID \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And type would utterance . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So 's similar . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So would waste way 's similar enough always translate \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: It probably would n't waste . It would mean point wanted switch , 'd \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: Write translator , 's \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Since 're developing big \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I n't think 's big deal . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: They 're developing big infrastructure . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And seems want use , might well go directly 're rather \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Yeah , 's question . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: I mean , stable \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: Are ready go ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I looked \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I looked couple year ago , probably year ago , first started talking . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And time , least , still complete . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And specifically , n't external format representation time . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: They sort conceptual node annotated transcription graph , I really liked . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And 's exactly stuff based . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Since , 've developed external file format , sort thing . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And apparently , 've also developed lot tool , I n't looked . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Maybe I \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Would tool run something like ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And translate anyway ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I mean , I guess 's question . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: What would worry maybe might miss little detail . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: That would make difficult translate one . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: They 're conceptually close . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: And already tool everybody else using . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: I mean , might well . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So I 'll take closer look . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So would really question feel long run best thing . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Because start sort , n't actually enough time probably rehash . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: The way I sort established easy translation transcriber format . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Right . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: But \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: I mean , I like . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: This sort intuitively easy actually read easy could . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: But I suppose long type specifies \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: It 's almost . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: The point though ca n't really add supplementary information . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So suddenly decide want \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: You make different type . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Yeah , 'd make different type . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Well , look , I guess mind , I n't know enough Jane would know better type annotation . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: But I imagine thing \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Well , guy mentioned could span \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: It could channel . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: It could span time boundary type . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: It could instantaneous . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Things like . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And recognition side , back trace phone level . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: If could handle , could handle state whatever . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And prosely level , frame sort like actual feature file , like P file anything like . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And 's sort world thing I \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And align channel . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Very coarse . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: It seems want keep frame level stuff separate . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Yeah , I definitely agree . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And I wanted find actually nicer format maybe compact format used . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Just 've got 10 channel whatever two hour meeting . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: How would represent multiple speaker framework ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Were represent would like speaker tag something ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: There 's speaker tag top , identifies . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And way I turn , I n't even remember , speaker ID tag attached . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And format , would different tag , would linked link . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So somewhere else would another thing would \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Let 's see , would node link ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And one would ID , link 74 something like . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And somewhere would link referencing L74 speaker item . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Actually , channel I think \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Well , channel channel lie . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: This n't quite right . I look . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: But next format express hierarchical relationship , say , utterance word within ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So tell word belong utterance ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: You would another structure lower , would saying 're belonging ID . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: So thing refers utterance belongs ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: Right . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So utterance could refer term , term could refer something higher . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And actually Right utterance , closest thing come channel lie stuff segment boundary transcriber put T-Lo put . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Which may may actually like It 's usually beginning end sentence . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Well , 's I n't call sentence . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Right . So 's like segment something . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So I mean , soon possible someone annotates punctuation whatever transcribe , say , know , beginning sentence end sentence annotation , unit . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Even though never actually , 's unit virtue annotation word level . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Sure . I mean , would yet another tag . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: That would tag somehow . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: You 'd another tag say , type sentence . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: But 's overtly Because exactly kind \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: I think possible long But I n't understand type file would expressed . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Right . You would another tag somewhere . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Well , two way . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Two way . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And ID S whatever . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And lower , could utterance . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So type utterance equal UT . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And could either say No , I n't know . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: I take thing . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Can say You would part say part ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I think But would refer sentence . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: They 're actually overlapping . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: The thing something may part one thing one purpose another thing another purpose . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: You another type , I guess . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Well , I think I better look I \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So , instance There 's one level indirection I 'm forgetting . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So , word sequence two different segmentation word sequence , I say one segmentation term , know , sentence . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: And another segmentation term , I n't know , prosodic phrase . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: And let 's say n't nest . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So , know , prosodic phrase may cross two sentence something . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: I n't know 's true . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Well , 's definitely true segment . That 's I exactly meant utterance versus sentence . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So , want say word part sentence prosodic phrase . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: But phrase part sentence neither sentence part phrase . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I 'm pretty sure , I 'm forgetting exact level nesting . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Two different pointer word , one level . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So , would end tag saying , 's word start end . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And lower would say , 's prosodic boundary word . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And lower 'd , 's sentence word . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So , would able go say , know , give word bound , prosodic phrase , give word . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So , I think 's word . Let look . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Okay . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: The issue , actually efficiently extract , find extract information structural type ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So , gave example , like . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Well , I mean , guy might , I n't know premature I suppose get representation , , kind thing I worried \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: No , 's clear . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Well , okay , , ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: I mean , I ca n't , know . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Well , 're going , 're going want quickly , else 'll spend time sort searching various \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Right , need sort paradigm , example would , find case Adam started talk Andreas talking pitch rising . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Andreas pitch . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Right , I mean , 's going , rising pitch feature , going file ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Well , rising pitch never hand annotated , prasodic feature going automatically \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I mean , 's going hard , regardless , right , 're going write program go feature file look rising pitch . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So normally would would say , going assign rising pitch , going assign word , going assign sort 's rising , begin rise representation , suppose dump file , say \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: For every word , classify rise fall neither . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Okay , well , case , would add format . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: We would basically sort taking format enriching thing want query relation word already file , querying . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: You want sort graph work structural \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: You . There 's standard XML , specifically searching XML document , structured XML document , specify content structural position . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Yeah , 's clear 's relative structure XML document . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: You use tool . You use tool , end user . It 's end user thing . You would use build tool sort search . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Because 're specifying lattice , underlying data structure whole search lattice . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: That 's different searching . As long feature Well , , whole point text lattice isomorphic . They represent completely . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: That 's true feature acoustic whatever explicitly level type . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: If Yeah , 's going trouble matter format choose . You 're going difficulty relating frame level feature . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: I 'm going figure 's best format representation . It 's still going direct . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Another example language , word sequence people interrupting ? I guess one 's actually easier . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: What idea using relational database store information XML ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: So would XML basically would You could use XML put data . And get data , put back XML . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: So use XML sort transfer format . But store data database , allows kind good search thing . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: One thing Atlas 're trying define API , independent backstort . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So could define single API storage could flat XML file database . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: My opinion sort stuff 're , I suspect 's overkill full relational database \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Just flat file search tool I bet enough . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: But 's advantage Atlas actually decide go route completely program API , wanted add database later , would pretty easy . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: It seems like kind thing people start adding kind file whistle data . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And might good u use format know easily input database people . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I guess I 'm little hesitant try go whole hog sort whole framework NIST talking Atlas database sort stuff . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Because 's big learning curve get going . Whereas flat file format , sure may efficient , everyone program Perl use . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Right , opposed \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: I 'm still convinced much text flat file text representation . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Because text representation going reflecting structure word annotation . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So 's representing , recover ? Of course 's representing . That 's whole point . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: You basically , yeah , use Perl read construct internal representation essentially lattice . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Okay , well different point , right ? So I saying \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: But 's 'll . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Perl , want Perl . If wanted use structured XML query language , 's different thing . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And 's set tool let specify given DDDD document sort structural search want . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So want say 're looking tag within tag within particular tag particular text refers particular value . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And point n't end user looking query like specified would n't program language . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: What would someone would build tool used library would n't construct internal representation 're seeing . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So I think kind question , least next end year , may lot different one , 'll similar nature . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: They 'll looking either word level , prosadik , value , like continuous value , like slope something . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: But 'll something , kind data reduction prosadik feature either word level segment level something like . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: They 're going phone level 're going frame level get done sort giving simpler shape thing . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And main thing able , well , I guess two goal , one Chuck mentioned starting something n't start , n't throw away people want extend kind question . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And able least get enough information condition location feature information 's kind file put . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And would . I mean , I think quick dirty solution long term big infrastructure solution . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And want try pick something let u little bit . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And especially representation n't thrown away , even tool change . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And seems I look see whether really want . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: But use Atlas external file representation , seems like 's rich enough could quick tool I said Pearl . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And later , choose go learning curve , use whole Atlas infrastructure . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And sound good . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Which built . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So look let u know think , I mean , I think 're sort getting thing I want get property work done , I n't want waste time getting , yeah ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Well , I would n't wait format anything pick able translate another form . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Well , maybe actually look get sense dealing Adam might one opinion . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: I definitely . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Yeah , definitely . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: I think eye look , better . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Especially 's , know , someone help least setup right . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Okay . \n",
      "SPEAKER_00: The right representation . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Then , know , I hope wo n't , n't actually need whole full blown . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Thank . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Thank . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So maybe guy look see I think 're , I think 're end . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Yeah , wrapping . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: But yeah , sorry , 's short meeting , n't I , anything else like help ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Well , I think thing might want look alternative P file . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I mean , reason I like P file , I 'm already familiar , expertise . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And pick something else , 's learning curve problem . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: But I mean , something developed XE . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: And , API ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Yeah , 's API . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: And bunch library , P file utility . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: And basically file system , \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Well , 's going problem , matter . You two gigabyte limit file system size . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And definitely hit broadcast news . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Maybe could extend API support , like , splitting , know , conceptually one file smaller file disk essentially . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Yeah , know , tool handle n't API level . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: We tool level many , specify several P file . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And 'll done sequentially . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So I guess , yeah , Don , show P file stuff . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Sure . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So may like . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So 's file apropos P file see . \n",
      "SPEAKER_00: I 've looked least briefly . \n",
      "SPEAKER_00: I think . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I idea . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I n't . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I n't develop . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: You know , I think Dave Johnson . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So 's part quick net library utility . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: No , P file around . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Maybe quick net . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Oh , 're . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Rapp , right ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: You work P file . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: I n't remember P . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: But . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: The quick net library bunch thing handle P file work pretty well . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And n't really , I guess , important main , I n't know call . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: The main third third ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: It stand fill . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: Fill cone . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: Is fill file ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: That 's guess . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Well , 's really useful . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: I mean , exactly kind thing wanted set . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: You meaning look whole stuff anyway . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: I guess 's also sort political decision . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: I mean , feel like 's community would good tie anyway , 's something 're . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And I said , I stuff , I based . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: It 's n't actually come external format yet . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: So come format , seems pretty reasonable use . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: But let look . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Okay , great . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: As I said . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Because 's one level , 's one level indirection I 'm blanking exactly work . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: I got look . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And start , I guess , input Dave 's , printed channelized input . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Because channel channel tag stuff like . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So would directly easy wrapped . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And would matter making sure handle annotation word level . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Where annotation coming ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Well , right , Jane would . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: Are talking overlap annotation ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Yeah , kind annotation n't already . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Anything vision . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: So I imagining , Dave say , unlimited number green ribbon . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: And put green ribbon overlap code . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: And since , I think 's important remain flexible regarding time bin . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: And 's nice , however , know , want time located discourse . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: So tie overlap code first word overlap , 'll time marking . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: It 'll independent time bin , however , evolve shranker , whatever increase , also could different time bin different purpose . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: And tied first word overlap segment unique , know , anchored , clear . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: And would end separate ribbon . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: So overlap code going easy respect . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: It 'll puzzled . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: I , I n't quite understand thing . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: What code ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: Overlap code , I 'm sure 're . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: Well , I mean , 's . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: Well , probably n't matter . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: It n't mean n't . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: It 's topic meeting . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: No , idea separate green ribbon , know , let 's say time bin . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: There 's word . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: It 's first word overlap segment length overlapping word , segment length . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: And indicate perhaps back channel , say usurping journey , could , know , number category . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: But fact time tag way independent particular time bin word end , 's large unit small unit , change boundary unit . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: Right ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: It 's still unique fit format flexible . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: It would nice . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: This sort regarding , 's related correctly main topic discussion . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: But come annotation , often find situation different annotation word sequence . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Okay ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: And sometimes word sequence even differ slightly edited one place , . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So data get , people might start annotating , I n't know , ILR act , know , topic heck , know , 's zillion thing people might annotate . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: And thing really sort common among various version data word sequence , proximity . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: For time . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Or time , see annotate dialogue act , n't necessarily want , topic , n't really want dealing time mark . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: It 's much efficient see word sequence , right ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: I mean , people n't sophisticated , know , time alignment stuff . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So point \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Did mention name \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So point 're going end word sequence differently annotated . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: And want tool able sort merge different annotation back single version . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Okay . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: And problem massively SRI worked back dialogue act well , know , ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Well , thing \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: At time , automatic punctuation stuff like . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Because one set annotation based one version transcript particular segmentation . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: And another version based different slightly edited version transcript different segmentation . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So two different version , know , could tell source , n't identical . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So extremely hard reliably merge two back together correlate information different annotation . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Yeah . I n't see way file format going help u . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: No . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: It 's question semantic . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: But file format , I imagine writing , personally , someone writing tool essentially alignment tool mediates various version . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: And sort like , know , thing Unix \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Diff . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: W-diff , \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: There 's diff actually try reconcile different \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: And two diffs based original . Something like . But operating lattice really 's behind \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Yeah . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: There 's actually diff library use thing like . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So somewhere A4 , would like like merge function merges two \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Yeah , I think 's going hard . Any sort structured , anything try merge really , really hard hard part n't file format . The hard part specifying mean merge . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: But one would work actually 's reliable utterance speaker . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: So good \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: But exactly I mean . Is problem \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: What tie ? Yeah , exactly . The problem saying , semantics ? What mean merge ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So let know clued based word . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So two version word , sprinkle different tag . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And diff . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And diff . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: Yeah , 's I thought . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: And 's I would done . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: But know , lot error thing would end wrong order forth . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: It clued basically reducing everything \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: Textual . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: To textual alignment . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: But n't something \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Whoever \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: If people making change say transcript , happened transcript different . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: If tie something , like tied acoustic segment . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: If \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: You know I mean ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: If tied acoustic segment time march would help . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: But problem exactly Adam said get \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: You know , n't information 's lost merge somehow . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Okay , one question . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: It seems official version corpus , one version term word . \n",
      "SPEAKER_02: We still emerging issue , maybe , coding done independently \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: And 're going get data get , people kind thing . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: And know , several year , might want look prosody referring expression . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: And someone University Who know annotated referring expression . \n",
      "SPEAKER_01: So want get annotation bring back line data . \n",
      "SPEAKER_04: But unfortunately , 've also handed . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: But 've also handed . \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: And 's exactly somehow distribute data , say know , way knowing merge back asking people write . \n",
      "SPEAKER_05: What 's wrong time ? \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Yeah , time \n",
      "SPEAKER_03: Well \n",
