0:00:00	None
 excuse me please OK Its the last piece I've styled

0:00:26	None
 ok Okay, so we are here for the concept design meeting.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_04
 So we will first start by summarizing the previews meeting and the decision we've taken.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_04
 I will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_04
 So each of you will show us the various investigations that are done during previews hours.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_04
 We will then take the decision on concept and then we will define the next task to be done before the next meeting.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_04
 So last time we decided to have a simple interface.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_04
 We also decided to have a will to change channel, preview channel button, channel digest buttons should be protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_04
 We have also button for volume and to switch on of the TV.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_04
 We have also the lightning feature for the remote control to be easy to find and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no LCD nor voice features.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_04
 So now we will have three presentations.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_04
 So the concept you are specification by industrial designer, the specification of the UI or U.I.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_01
 Up to last thread.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_01
 It's my name.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_04
 And the last point is train watching by market expert.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe we can start with industrial design.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_04
 So this is the presentation idea.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe I can switch slide on your request.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_02
 I only have three slides.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_02
 So I just look at the just these on some web pages to find some documentation.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_02
 And I think a remote control is as I mentioned previously.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_02
 You just have a very simple chip and the user interface is just done usually by push button.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_02
 In our case we are using a wheel control.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_02
 So I was looking basically for that chip which is a very, very standard and I just look for the wheel sensor and the standard push button.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_02
 And yeah, we can change directly.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_02
 In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_02
 The push button are usually extremely cheap but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor which seems to be quite expensive.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_02
 And I think if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not, if we combine something with a push button.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_02
 A wheel sensor is 50 times the price of a push button.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_04
 But is it a significant price on the world remote control?

0:04:23	SPEAKER_04
 Because we can afford up to 12 euros for the price of the remote control.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_04
 So we'll deal with including all possible things.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_04
 So buttons will and the chip be lower than 12 euros to produce.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_02
 But I don't think that we should talk about the design of the bus.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_02
 So which is also, it's a lot of you have to say.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_01
 Do you receive the mail about voice recognition?

0:04:56	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, that's all.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_01
 You receive something.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_01
 I have something.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we have an email from the Wine Factory Division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_03
 Hmm.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_01
 It says right now they just use it to record answers to particular questions.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_01
 But I guess it could be adapted.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_01
 I guess it's possible.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it's the recording answers.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_01
 You can just record something simpler.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_04
 And they can recognize some commands.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_01
 You can recognize commands.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_01
 You can record new commands and stuff.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_01
 So if they already have it as an ad-zip.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_04
 You could use it.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we can just listen to this presentation and then take this issue later on according

0:05:45	SPEAKER_02
 to those news. But I think it's, yeah, sorry.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_02
 I haven't written my personal references.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_02
 And I just want to mention the problem of the wheels and so, which is much more expensive than any bus, but if we could reduce that.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_02
 We have already some good things with the back lights of the push button.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_01
 I have a question about that, actually.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_01
 What is the purpose of the light?

0:06:22	SPEAKER_02
 Just to make something which is slightly more designed that is a squaring box.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_04
 You can use it if you find a button.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_01
 But the dark.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but is it going to go all the way to turn it on?

0:06:36	None
 The light.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_04
 It will be turned on when the user moves the room of control.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_01
 I think, no, but if you move it, then you have it.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_01
 You don't need to find it.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_01
 You can see the buttons better, of course.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_03
 True.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_01
 But if you move it, then you have to have some sensor.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_01
 When you move it, you have to have some sensor.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_02
 As soon as you start to move the remote control, you have the right.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_01
 But you need another sensor for that, right?

0:07:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_02
 Again.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_01
 You know, it's just the same.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think that this is really expensive, but at the end, this is plenty of...

0:07:21	SPEAKER_02
 Unexp... a very cheap device, but the bit installs to be...

0:07:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but actually, it will do a bit of it, but you tell me that it's very expensive.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_02
 First of all, I was thinking to have a continuous light and you...

0:07:37	SPEAKER_02
 when you press the unbutton, you have the light when you're remote control.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_02
 When you want to turn off the lights.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_04
 Because it can be battery-consuming, no?

0:07:51	SPEAKER_04
 To have the light always on.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_02
 A little bit.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we discussed that after maybe...

0:07:57	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_01
 Because a presentation one should be in the shirt folder.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_01
 It would last time I showed it.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_04
 And it is.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_01
 So, okay, let's move to the next slide.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_01
 So basically, I want very simple, right?

0:08:30	SPEAKER_01
 That's a major idea.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_01
 As you were supposed to be.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_01
 So, I just looked at some current designs on the web of usually more complicated remote controls.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_01
 And I just looked at all of them because even though they have many buttons, they look quite simple.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_01
 And in our case, we just rejected the buttons that we don't need.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_01
 And we got even simpler.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_04
 And also, does it fit well in hand?

0:08:55	SPEAKER_04
 Because it was the...

0:08:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_04
 You risk problems with the user.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_01
 Well, these remotes are quite big.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 So, we got the next page.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_01
 The hub looks bad, as you can see.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_01
 But most of them, we just need the ones in the middle.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_01
 So, from the bottom, where there's the numbers and then the top, until the tunnel, this middle part.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_01
 And on the last one, it's exactly the same.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_01
 So, it's basically more or less how we like it with a big volume control, big tunnel control, a mutant power.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_04
 It's the basic thing.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_04
 So, it's only the central part.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_01
 So, basically, something that we would look more or less the same as these two.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe a more economic design on the...

0:09:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, if we have for example, I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach to your thumb.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe on the right side, for example.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_01
 Because we don't have this input buttons and there's other stuff that they have.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_01
 And I think that the plastic cover is not very good idea, because you open it, it can break.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 You can do various things.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_01
 You just need to put the tunnel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_01
 So, that's a big problem.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_01
 That's a big problem.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_01
 It's used to press the big buttons, but it's not difficult to press the tunnel buttons either.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_01
 I think that it should put the cover to be very difficult for the user.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_01
 You won't...

0:10:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_01
 Usually what I have noticed are people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with, like buttons for tuning the tunnels and something like that.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_01
 But you want to protect it with...

0:10:38	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's a... it's a reasonable.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_01
 So, I don't think...

0:10:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_01
 This is just the wheel.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_01
 Some wheels can be pushed down.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_01
 You could use the...

0:10:50	SPEAKER_01
 Push down of the wheel for the call, if you want.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_01
 So, you could just basically use one, just wheel and...

0:10:57	SPEAKER_01
 User could use it just to do everything at the time.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_01
 In that case.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage of our competitors, because otherwise it's pretty standard about the fact that it's very simple.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_04
 So, maybe this was to have more expense on that aspect.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_01
 I guess the market is going to tell us about that.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_04
 So, we can move to the...

0:11:32	SPEAKER_04
 Is there any question for designer of user interface?

0:11:38	SPEAKER_04
 Or we can move to the next part?

0:11:41	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe, and discuss afterwards.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_00
 You can go.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_00
 So, there are the recent investigation we have done for the remote control.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_00
 So, the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel, and not current functional look and feel.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_00
 And the second aspect is that the remote control should be technological innovative.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_00
 And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_00
 So, things we have...

0:12:37	SPEAKER_00
 Speak about before.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_00
 And so, you can go after.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_00
 Foot and visual tables will be the most important theme for closed issues and funatures.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_00
 So, maybe if our remote control has to be a foot form or vegetable forms, something like that.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_02
 What's the most important thing for?

0:13:15	SPEAKER_00
 And the material is expected to be spongy.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_00
 So, I don't know which material can be spongy and if you...

0:13:26	SPEAKER_01
 It's good also for...

0:13:32	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's good also to have a spongy control in the television.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because it's...

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 It's a good one.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_01
 You could say that when you throw it in the television, it's intense.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_01
 When it takes a shock.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what they do that for around the clock.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_00
 And this...

0:14:00	SPEAKER_00
 You can go before...

0:14:03	SPEAKER_00
 Before?

0:14:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_00
 And you know, the more important aspect is the fancy you can feel after is the technological innovative and after the easy to use.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's innovative to use the wheel because I think you want to use it.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_00
 That's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think it makes it both easy and both innovative.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's a good aspect and it should look cool.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_04
 Cool, fancy.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_04
 We have to make it look like a fruit or a vegetable.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe a color that's remembered.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, a color.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_04
 Things like that.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_01
 Although, obviously, it's a banana, I guess.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_00
 I thought about a pear, for example.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_00
 You know, a pear is like that.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_00
 And it's easy to have in the other side.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_00
 And it's a ergonomic as well.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_04
 A pear.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe pear, yeah, I have something like that.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, a fruit like that, I don't know.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we can discuss that.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_04
 Is there anything you want to add?

0:15:18	SPEAKER_01
 Is there any fruit that is spongy?

0:15:22	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think so.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_04
 I think we can have like a pear is good, fit well or banana, as you told.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_05
 And something like that.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_02
 Or maybe look and feel what about a piece of ice with blue LED inside.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_02
 But that's not in the train.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_04
 The train is spongy and vegetable fruit.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_04
 It's not hard metal.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_04
 I think spongy is good because it will be robust as well.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_04
 So I think we can keep the wheel because it's easy.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_04
 It's innovative even if the cost is a bit higher.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_04
 And we also have to find a fruit like pear or a banana with any others idea you have.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_04
 What kind of fruit would you like to control your TV with?

0:16:33	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know, I think it's a nice idea.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_04
 Because you can't lose your remote control day.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_02
 You don't use the banana, the banana is curving like that.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_02
 But when the banana is curving like that, with the wheel on the top and to control, and here you have a brush button.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_01
 I think you can just have the curve.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_01
 And you move your hands here to press the buttons and then you move on the other side.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_01
 So you can have it on two sides and be cool.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we can keep the banana and it will be very easy to find.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_04
 And everybody knows what is a banana.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_02
 Basically, if you start with fancy fruits,

0:17:23	SPEAKER_01
 you can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the color scheme of our company.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's really a good point.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_01
 I hope you do it so that the banana is a die.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's a good idea.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's so...

0:18:01	SPEAKER_04
 So we have to take some decision on those aspects.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_04
 So for...

0:18:09	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry, for components.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_04
 So we have to think about those aspects.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_02
 So we will just use a standard battery.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_02
 And the chip on print, we know exactly which one we are going to use.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_02
 What do you mean by case?

0:18:31	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's the box that should be spongy banana's shape.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, for me, if we use a spongy banana case, it doesn't matter.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_02
 I just want to have something to print to fix my components.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_02
 And to that box, it can be an inside day, in a structure.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_01
 But the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be spongy.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_01
 Then the buttons and the wheel have to...

0:19:02	SPEAKER_01
 If it's spongy, then it's going to move, right?

0:19:05	SPEAKER_01
 So it could be bent a lot.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's possible.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_04
 No, the button would be...

0:19:12	SPEAKER_04
 In fact, it should be something out-shaped with spongy cover.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_02
 This is like...

0:19:21	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, our shape with spongy cover.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_04
 And the standard battery.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, chip on print, there's no specific problem.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_04
 So we agreed to put the wheel.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_02
 Wheel on the top button.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_02
 Why do you want some buttons?

0:19:44	SPEAKER_01
 Well, usually, you want to be good also for the left hand user, right?

0:19:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_04
 So it has to be symmetrical?

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but it's okay.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_01
 So let's say that...

0:19:59	SPEAKER_01
 Basically, you can only take two sides.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_01
 This side where there's a thumb, and the other side where there's...

0:20:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, also the thumb.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_01
 Or you could use this one, but don't know if it's very comfortable.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, maybe the thumb is more comfortable.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_01
 This for the wheel and then this for the buttons.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and I think it's okay for the right and left.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 So we've got left.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_01
 You have the...

0:20:24	SPEAKER_04
 I think you can turn it this way or so.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_04
 You can do this with wheel buttons.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the blue wheel is have buttons and wheel.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_01
 Then when you turn it around, the buttons are on the other side.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_01
 You cannot see them.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_04
 Well, you will get used to it.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_04
 And the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be...

0:20:43	SPEAKER_04
 The buttons are lighted, so you immediately identify the right side.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_04
 Because you have light on buttons.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I know, but if you have to do your left hand and the wheel is here and the buttons are here, then when you turn it around, the buttons will go on the other side.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_04
 No, I think you will use it on the right or left hand.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_04
 Whether you're right here or lefty.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_04
 I think for lefty it's okay.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_04
 I can do this movement and for righty as well.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_04
 I think this doesn't change that much.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, maybe.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_04
 So for interface, we said so that we have a...

0:21:31	SPEAKER_04
 This banana shape with button on the side.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_04
 And the wheel on the top.

0:21:44	None
 Yeah.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_04
 So the color is yellow.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's...

0:21:56	SPEAKER_04
 We define everything according to what we should...

0:22:01	SPEAKER_04
 But the decision we should take, yeah.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe we can...

0:22:08	SPEAKER_04
 We can work on do the spectre until next meeting.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_04
 So we have the final look and fill design according to the decision.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_04
 And have the user interface design and then evaluate the product.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_04
 That is to say, check if it fits the requirement given by the users.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_04
 But according to your presentation, it seems to be okay.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_04
 It seems to be fancy, innovative and easy to use.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_04
 So to prepare the product, I would suggest that the industrial designer and the user interface designer...

0:22:59	SPEAKER_04
 Work together that would be better, I think.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_04
 And so you will receive further instruction by email, as usual.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, master.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_04
 Do you need to add anything?

0:23:22	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_04
 You feel okay?

0:23:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_04
 You feel free to express what you want to say.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_04
 You don't feel too constrained.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_04
 You don't feel free to answer this.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_04
 No, you can't.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_04
 No, no.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_04
 So...

0:23:43	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_04
 See you.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you.

0:23:53	None
 I think we can live the room.

0:23:56	None
 Try to contract me.
