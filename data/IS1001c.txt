0:00:00	None
 Oh yeah. Excuse me.

0:00:02	None
 Of course I can stay.

0:00:08	None
 Okay.

0:00:10	SPEAKER_04
 A nice picture. Okay.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_04
 So we are here for the concept design meeting.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_04
 So we will first start by summarizing the previous meeting and the decision we've taken.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_04
 I will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_04
 So each of you will show us the various investigations they've done during.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_04
 Previous hours.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_04
 We'll then take the decision and concept and then we will define the next task to be done before the next meeting.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_04
 So last time we decided to have a simple interface.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_04
 We also decided to have a will to change channel, preview channel button, channel digits.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_04
 This button should be protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_04
 We have also buttoned for volume and to switch on of the TV.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_04
 We have also the lightning feature for the remote control to be easy to find.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_04
 So for the first development and low cost we have decided to have no LCD nor voice features.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_04
 So now we will have three presentations.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_04
 So the concept you have specification by industrial designer.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_04
 The specification of the UI by...

0:02:25	SPEAKER_04
 The last point is train watching by market expert.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe we can start with industrial design.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_04
 So this is the presentation idea.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe I can switch slide on your request.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_02
 I only have three slides.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_02
 So I just look at the...

0:03:01	SPEAKER_02
 Just on some web pages to find some documentation.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_02
 And I think a remote control is, as I mentioned previously, you just have a very simple chip.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_02
 And the user interface is just done usually by push button.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_02
 And in our case we are using a wheel control.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_02
 So I was looking basically for that chip, which is a very, very standard.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_02
 And I just look for the wheel sensor and the standard push button.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_02
 And we can change directly.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_02
 In fact, I have the number of that element, which is very standard for remote control.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_02
 The push button are usually extremely cheap.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_02
 But I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor, which seems to be quite expensive.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. And I think if we could just talk about that, if we really need a wheel sensor, or if we can combine something with a push button.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. A wheel sensor is 50 times the price of a push button.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_04
 But is it a significant price on the world remote control?

0:04:23	SPEAKER_04
 Because we can afford up to 12 euros for the price of the remote control.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. So will this, including all possible things, so buttons will, and the chip, be lower than 12 euros to produce?

0:04:40	SPEAKER_02
 But I don't think that we should, we should talk about the design of the box.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_02
 So we need some money.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_01
 I also have to say, did you receive the mail about voice recognition?

0:04:55	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, that's all.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_01
 You received something?

0:05:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. We have an email from the Wine Factory division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_01
 Hmm.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_01
 It says right now we just use it to record the answers to particular questions.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_01
 But I guess we could be adapted, I guess it's possible.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_01
 Instead of recording the answers, you can just record something simpler.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. And there can recognize some commands.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. You can recognize commands. You can record new commands and stuff.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_01
 So if you already have the other tip.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. You could use it.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. Maybe we can just listen to this presentation and then take the decision later.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_02
 And according to those news.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_02
 But I think it's, yeah. Sorry. I haven't written my personal references.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_02
 I just want to mention the problem of the wheels and so, which is much more expensive than any push button.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_02
 So we could reduce that. We have already some good things with the back lights of the push button.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_01
 I have a question about that actually.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_01
 What is the purpose of the light?

0:06:21	SPEAKER_02
 Just to make something which is slightly more designed that is a square root box.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_04
 You can use the button.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_01
 But the dark also. But in the dark.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. But it's going to go all the way down the light.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_04
 It will be turned on when the user moves the remote control. I think no.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_01
 What if you move it and you have it? You don't need to find it.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_01
 You can see the buttons better of course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_01
 True.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_01
 But if you move it, then you have to have some sensor to move it to detect that you're moving it.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_02
 As soon as you start to move the remote control you have the right.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. But you need another sensor for that. Right. Yeah. Again.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's too expensive.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think that this is really expensive. But at the end this is plenty of the rich devices.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_01
 But the build installs to be. Yeah. But the experience will be too expensive.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_02
 First of all I was thinking to have a continuous light.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_02
 And you press the button. You have the light on your remote control.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_02
 Or once you want to turn off. But it can be battery consuming now.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_02
 To have the light always on. A little bit.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_04
 Well we will discuss that after maybe. Okay.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_01
 The other presentation. No, my one should be in the shared folder. Yeah.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_01
 It was last time I saw it.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_04
 And it is.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_01
 So, okay. Let's move the next slide.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_01
 So basically I want very simple. Right.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_01
 That's a major idea. I suppose. Yeah.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_01
 So I just looked at some current designs on the web of usually more complicated remote controls.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_01
 And I selected two of them. Because even though they have many buttons they look quite simple.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_01
 And in our case we just rejected the buttons that we don't need. Yeah.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_04
 And also does it fit well in. And because it was the risk problem.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_01
 Well these remote are quite big. So go to the next page.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_01
 So the hub works buttons as you can see. But most of them we just need the ones in the middle.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. So from the bottom where there's the numbers and then the top until the channel.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_01
 So this middle part. And the left one is exactly the same.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_01
 So it's basically more or less how we would like it with big volume control, big channel control,

0:09:25	SPEAKER_04
 and mutant power. Yeah. Yeah. It's the basic thing. So it's only the central part.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_01
 So basically something that we would look more or less the same as these two.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. With maybe a more economic design on the... Yeah.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_01
 If you look for example, I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top part are not very easy to reach your thumb. Yeah. It could be on the right side for example.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. Yeah. Because we don't have these input buttons and all the stuff that they have.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_01
 And I think that the plastic cover is not very good idea because you open it, it can break.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 You can do various things. Okay.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_01
 You just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. So that's a bit better. Yeah.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. And just to press the other big buttons. But it's not be difficult to press the channel button side there.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_01
 I think that if you put the cover, it would be even more difficult for the user. Okay.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. Yeah.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_01
 Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with, like buttons for tuning the channels and stuff like that.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. That you want to protect it with.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's an intelligent algorithm. Okay.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_01
 So I don't think, yeah. This is just the wheel.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_01
 Some wheels can be pushed down, could use a push down of the wheel for their call if you want.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_01
 So you could just basically use one, just wheel and a user could use just the wheel to everything.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. At the time. In that case.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_04
 Otherwise it's pretty standard about the fact that it's very simple.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe this was to have more expense on that aspect.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. I guess the market itself would tell us about that.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. So we can move to the, is there any question for designer of user interface?

0:11:40	SPEAKER_04
 We can move to the next part. Maybe and discuss afterwards.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. Okay. You can go. Yeah.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_00
 So now the recent investigation we have done for the remote control.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_00
 So the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_00
 And the second aspect is that the remote control should be technological innovative.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. And the third most important aspect is to, is that the remote control should be easy to use. So things we have, we have speak about before. Yeah.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_00
 And so you can go after.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_00
 And there is a fashion which is in Paris and Milan that I've detected the following trends.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_00
 Fruits and vegetables will be the most important time for closes shoes and furniture.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe if our remote control has to be a food form or vegetable forms, something like that.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_02
 What's important, April?

0:13:15	SPEAKER_00
 And the material is expected to be spongy.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_00
 So I don't know which material can be spongy and if you...

0:13:27	SPEAKER_01
 This is good also for, I think, just the electronics and the things that work, right?

0:13:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. I think it is good also to have a spongy control metal television.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because it's progress. It's progress, yeah.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_01
 Hey, that's a cool one.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_01
 We could say that if you throw it, you have a sensor and you throw it and you can tell the vision and it's a ten-hit-off.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_01
 When it takes a shock.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. I know that they do that for around the clock.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_00
 And this, you can say that.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_00
 You can go before?

0:14:04	SPEAKER_00
 Before? Yes.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_00
 And you know, yeah, the more important aspect is the fancy look and feel.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_00
 After is the technological innovative and after the easy twig.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yes. I think it's innovative to use the wheel because I think the one is in the side.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's why I think we have to keep that if possible.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. I think it makes it both easy and both innovative.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_04
 So I think it's a good aspect and it's a good look.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_04
 Cool. Fancy.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. We have to make it look like a fruit or a vegetable.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. What about it?

0:14:49	SPEAKER_04
 A color that remembers something.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_04
 Things like that.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_01
 The obvious thing is a banana, I guess.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_00
 I thought about a P, for example. You know, a P is like that.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_00
 And it's easy to have in a hundred times.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. A pure.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_04
 A banana is also going to look.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe pure, yeah, something like that.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, a fruit like that, I don't know.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. We can discuss that.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_04
 Is there anything you want to add?

0:15:19	SPEAKER_01
 Is there any fruit that is spongy?

0:15:23	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think so.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_04
 I think we can have like a pure is good, fit well or banana, you too.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe look and feel what about a piece of ice with blue LED inside.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_02
 But that's not in the train.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_04
 The train is spongy and vegetable fruit.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_04
 It's not in the toilet.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_04
 I think spongy is good because it will be robust as well.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_04
 So I think we can keep the wheel because it's easy, it's innovative, even if the cost is a bit higher.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_04
 And we also have to find a fruit like pure or banana with any other idea you have.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_04
 What kind of fruit would you like to control your TV with?

0:16:23	SPEAKER_02
 Banana is a nice idea.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_04
 Banana is also yellow, so you can't lose your remote control.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_02
 Don't use the banana.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_02
 The banana is curving like that, but when the banana is curving like that, with the wheel on the top, you can control.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_02
 But you don't have the first button.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_01
 You can just have the skill and you move your hand here to push the button and then you move on the other side.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_01
 You can have it on two sides and it will be cool.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we can keep the banana and it will be very easy to find.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_04
 Everybody knows what is a banana.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_02
 Basically, if you start with fancy fruits, you can also take the banana and feed it

0:17:28	SPEAKER_01
 with the color scheme of our company.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_04
 It's really a good point.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_01
 I hope this video does not manage to die.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_04
 I think so. We have to take some decisions on those aspects.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_04
 So for components, we have to think about those aspects.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_02
 So we will just use a standard battery.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_02
 We know exactly which one we are going to use.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_02
 What do you mean by case?

0:18:32	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's the box that should be a spongy banana shape.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_02
 For me, if we use a spongy banana case, it doesn't matter.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_02
 I just want to have something to print to fix my components on two of that box.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_01
 It can't be inside the inner structure.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_01
 The thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be a spongy.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_01
 Then the buttons and the wheel have to move.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_01
 It's going to bend a lot.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's possible.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's not. The button would be infected.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_04
 It should be something out-shaped with a spongy cover.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_02
 This is like a...

0:19:22	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_04
 Out-shaped with spongy cover.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_04
 And standard battery.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_04
 A cheap one print.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_04
 There's no specific problem.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_04
 So we agreed to put the wheel.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_02
 The wheel on the top button.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_02
 Why do we want some buttons?

0:19:45	SPEAKER_01
 Well, usually hold...

0:19:47	SPEAKER_01
 It won't be good also for the left hand user, right?

0:19:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_04
 So it has to be symmetrical.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but it's okay.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_01
 So let's say that...

0:20:00	SPEAKER_01
 Basically, you can only take two sides.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_01
 One side where there's a thumb, and the other side where there's...

0:20:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, also the thumb.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_01
 Or you could use this one, but it won't.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_01
 It's very comfortable.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, maybe this thumb is more comfortable.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 This for the wheel and then this for the buttons.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think it's okay for ghosts right and left.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 So if we get left, we have...

0:20:24	SPEAKER_04
 I think you can turn it this way or so.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_04
 You can do those with...

0:20:30	SPEAKER_04
 With buttons.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the buttons and wheels, then we'll need 10th around.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_01
 The buttons are on the other side.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_01
 You can't see them.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_04
 Well, you will get used to it.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_04
 And more buttons have to be here and the wheels are here.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_04
 The buttons are lighted, so you immediately identify the right side.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_04
 Because you have light on buttons.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I know, but if you hold the left hand and the wheels here, and the buttons are here, they only turn around.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_01
 The buttons will be on the other side.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_04
 No, you... I think you will use it on the right or left hand, whether you're right here or left here.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_04
 I think for left it's okay.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_04
 I can do this movement and for right here as well.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_04
 I think this doesn't change that much.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah?

0:21:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, maybe.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_04
 So, for interface we said that we have this banana shape with buttons on the side.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_04
 And the wheel on the top.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_04
 So the color is yellow.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's... we define everything according to what we should...

0:22:01	SPEAKER_04
 but the decision we should take, yeah.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe we can... we can work on due respect until next meeting.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_04
 So, have the final look and feel design according to the decision.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_04
 And have the user interface design and then evaluate the product.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_04
 That is to say, check if it fits the requirement given by the users.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_04
 But according to your presentation, it seems to be okay.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_04
 It seems to be fancy, innovative and easy to use.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_04
 So, to prepare the prototype, I would suggest that the industrial designer and the user interface designer work together.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_04
 That would be better, I think.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_04
 And so you will receive further instruction by emails as usual.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, master.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_04
 Do you need to add anything?

0:23:23	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_04
 You feel okay?

0:23:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_04
 You feel free to express what you want to say.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_04
 You don't feel too constrained.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_04
 You don't feel free to answer this.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_04
 No, you can't.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_04
 So, see you.
