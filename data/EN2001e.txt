0:00:00	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure, but I'm not having crashes at the moment.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_00
 So what I'm having is...

0:00:07	SPEAKER_00
 So we had a long problem about not finding out why the time syncing up between the relative time in a sort of in a summarized section and the absolute time didn't correspond and stuff and we found it was some stupid... Well, at the moment our best guess is that it was some stupid Java thing about if you actually if you have two objects and you say A equals B they actually reference to the same thing. So any changes you make to one are made to the other end. If you do that around five corners you lose track of it and you suddenly wonder why that value is zero and it turns out it is zero because it's the same thing that you anyway so we figured out it's interesting why don't I have a screen here now? Okay that's new but that's okay.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_00
 It's doing different things all the time like this is the first time that actually but that should be okay that should be okay I'll be able to...

0:01:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah but last time I pressed that key combination everything went wrong and I think I'll be able to do just fine on the screen so that'll probably keep me from pointing on my screen which I usually... It might just be at this point like there's sometimes a point in loading not usually that long. Well, let's see.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway, so let's just see what happens.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_00
 The end we did get it.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_00
 So now I'm having a complete mess of like split...

0:01:42	SPEAKER_00
 split screen stuff I think last time. Yes but that's not what we wanted.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_00
 So but I think this is a lot of out-command and usually it resets this amazing strange color combinations. I see the fun of me at the moment.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah we somehow always get it working in different ways every time.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_00
 So that kept us like basically from doing anything else product for quite some time in the last days because we were hunting down that stupid arrow. I got it fixed in the last whatever one hour or something but so at the moment the program was sort of in between working and not working because we've done lots of changes to travel with the arrow was. Dave I think actually that the summary at the current moment isn't working a hundred percent correct but that could be because of the input data it seems to just take the first utterances more or less. If you first if you read through the summaries they read suspiciously fluent like as in people's questions and answers and then if you plot them on the screen where they are at the moment they seem to

0:02:55	SPEAKER_01
 use which data you use as well because if you data where they're already high it does prefer one from the beginning. Yes. So maybe that's where the problem is coming from.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_00
 I'll check it out. Yeah. This is when you start shifting around your laptop to think that it gets somehow less sloped on the screen. So I'm not really sure what this meeting is about to be honest. I'm gonna show this just what we have at the moment but it's not gonna look very different from what we had last time. Don't ask me what happened to the promise that you will get your script where you can use your own stuff because actually that was sort of ready but then we sort of started trying to get something more working and then we got into big problems. So at the moment I mean again we should be at a state where people can load their own stuff.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_00
 The thing is at the moment it's just really bad for me but from Monday on I can just do 24-7 for this one until it's you but until Monday it's gonna be really bad like I can probably help people if they have problems with getting what we have running now but I see. Okay. So I'll just start it up what we have now and then we can talk about what different people have.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_01
 Huh?

0:04:32	SPEAKER_02
 Doesn't look great does it?

0:04:35	SPEAKER_00
 Eek!

0:04:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah it doesn't.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_00
 But sometimes you have to take whatever you get and just see how far that can see.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_01
 That's really weird.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_01
 It just like pre-par

0:04:51	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah so it's perhaps in the meantime talk about the numbers we assigned to the dialogue acts because yeah I didn't know that you left out those who don't have words so I just extracted the actual dialogue numbers and the problem is it's perhaps more dangerous to get mistaken with all those numbers and not knowing why things happen if we just develop numbers and make new.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_01
 As long as the key corresponds then.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah sure but I mean for all those measures that are based on words I can automatically just throw those where it's nothing but those dialects like 33 in the first meeting. They have a duration even though they don't have a word.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_05
 So for my other measures I get them and I don't I mean I would have to look for every single word program that looks for every single number and does them I think

0:06:11	SPEAKER_01
 it's easier if there's a reference with the actual real idea and the corresponding standard.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah there are those index values already.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_02
 Is there somewhere else?

0:06:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah in the raw text index direction.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah that might be the map between the different ideas.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_01
 So that's all the problem.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah I just want to put why do you think it's necessary at all to do that?

0:06:38	SPEAKER_01
 Because the whole program works on them being numbered at the moment.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah and it's a problem if there's no.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_01
 There'd be a lot of work but there's really no extra feature there in the field.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_05
 But actually I think there is something in the audio shouldn't there if there's even though there's not a word I think in the audio there will be something at that point because it has a duration.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_01
 It could appear in something.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_01
 I think something in the audio is just like a noise and then we don't want to.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah yeah.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_02
 So you cut it out.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah the ones who don't have any words.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_00
 Would that not have met some sort of jumping in would that not have met some realization anyway even if they're in like the ones that have no words and that might have really low information density or something.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_01
 Right I think there's a thing is to depend if you want to ever display the whole thing of one.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_00
 Because you'd reckon that you could leave them in and they would never show up in a summary anyway.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_01
 And then he left them in and wouldn't affect the way the program works.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_05
 Why do you have a special hand in for those?

0:08:02	SPEAKER_01
 Well I don't.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_01
 It's just they're not in the raw.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_02
 It's just because they would have a blank lane in it.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_02
 But I could put them back in.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah and it's just the question I wanted to ask.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_01
 Either way is fine.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_01
 Why not.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_01
 Why do you have to go to it?

0:08:28	SPEAKER_00
 Wouldn't you think that if you just write the program in the way that even the way that it displays everything it still leaves those out.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_00
 Like if you give those a special information density idea or if you just put it back in the form of something.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yes something like that and then just make sure that summary even in the in the most summarized mode just never puts them in.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_04
 Might be a problem for me at this stage right now because I based everything on not having those.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah it's just a TF idea.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah my topic too.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't like blank lane.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_01
 Also.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_01
 That might be weird.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 Just the myth.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_04
 What I also did was having two people annotate the first meeting and so they didn't annotate the spaces and everything was messed up.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_04
 I think it had spaces for the new values so when I wanted to do correlation it wouldn't work anymore.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 It's my YouTube leave now.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_00
 Okay shall we take a quick look at the current set.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_04
 What I do is work for the work what I've got now and then just when I have my final formula ready I can apply it to the new stuff.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_05
 So by now how did you assign the Daredoc X number?

0:09:53	SPEAKER_05
 Did you take the one you found in the X and I find just put it back in the next section and put it there or did you?

0:10:03	SPEAKER_04
 No my TF idea is based on calling this data.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_04
 I end up with a saying.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_05
 Okay you end up with this.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah it is actually it is jumping now.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah I know actually the summary is probably okay.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah it did summarize just now.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_00
 It's just it's summarizing stupidly but at least it's jumping.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_04
 It was building.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yes and in fact at the moment I don't even know which of the two I'm summarizing over.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_00
 Do you know?

0:10:36	SPEAKER_00
 So at the moment the configuration is that word importance file is test 3 and TDID file is test.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_00
 I've just switched them around so I have no clue what we're actually doing at the moment.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_01
 Those names in this lead were TF ideas.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_00
 Especially since I've just switched them around anyway.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_00
 Okay by the way I read a paper which makes an important point about combining two things of that type.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_00
 It's basically it's going all about this fancy conical geometric mean which effectively just means multiplying them.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_00
 But I have some good information about different ways how you can sort of weight two different factors because it's for something very similar.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_00
 Somebody who tried to solve a very similar problem where they also had two factors sort of the one two way that together and there is like a good justifiable reason why we should do it in a certain way and how we can then with a simple parameter adjust how much one weighs how much the other weighs.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_00
 So there is something for just for putting them together in a relatively simple way but still a way that we can sort of justify.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_00
 We can quote stuff on that.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yes shall we?

0:11:44	SPEAKER_00
 Very complex.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_00
 No it's multiplying them.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_00
 And like putting them one over the power of something and the other over minus one.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_00
 One minus the power of something and that sort of and they've plotted some graphs about where they show like one going from zero to the one and the other going zero to one and like how the landscape changes how the parameter changes how it works.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_00
 So it's quite good.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_00
 So that's probably seeing that we're probably not going to go into any whatever base blah blah blah, macro model blah blah about combining them.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_00
 That's probably what we go at.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_00
 This is still not ideal at the moment David.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_00
 It's sort of it's over running the like it's okay.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 So at the moment we are that far that if I now click on to a segment here.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_00
 It's just right.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_00
 I just resized it a bit.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_00
 It's like the values are sort of hard coded for the screen sizes and dices and my screen is smaller.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_00
 So let's see I was a stupid user and was clicking on this segment.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_00
 We probably have to make the segment lines a lot bigger.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_00
 So then I did I get a new summarization.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_00
 I didn't actually see so let me check a different one.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_00
 So you see it's a different text and you see it's running through it and also you see the indicator in where we are is jumping.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_00
 So it's skipping stuff.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_00
 Now I don't think the summary at the moment is what we wanted to be seeing.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 They were like oh and exactly exactly right.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_00
 So this is again probably the opposite of what we want.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_00
 So it's probably some values that you have to divide by one divide by the value of something.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_01
 But I would have taken out some interesting stuff but we are looking at this.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yes but also every other word in that sentence we should look at are probably in your list of 50 least important words in the universe.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_00
 So it's probably just because if you look at the other one like this is just their best sentence for having function words in a row.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_00
 Sort of.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_00
 And every other.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_00
 I mean this one is sort of developing a big infrastructure.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it's just doing it randomly at the moment.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_00
 But we have some summary working and it has a good basis to start from.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_00
 If I promise now that you'll get something very competitive and data and it's sort of ringing

0:14:01	SPEAKER_01
 a bit hollow. I would probably say oh actually what is it that's been working with the work and like incomplete versions and what for a long time.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah still it's it's might be having some problem.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_00
 I think this one over wrenches before so we might still have some problem here that it's not stopping at the end.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_00
 But so Dave can you make the promise and I'm not making the promise realistically that the girls will very soon get.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_01
 Oh dude.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 First thing I'll do is make a lowy box for selecting.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_01
 And that's great.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_01
 It sets the class.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_01
 It's just a square.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_01
 Just class.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_01
 Like this.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_00
 So at the moment I've hard coded it to just taking one tenth of the number of utterances which were in the original selection.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_01
 So you'll have the promise of that.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_00
 It actually gives you an error if you put it to 20 because there's some things in there which are shorter than 20.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_00
 And if you select those then it's having a lead.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry if you check in.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_00
 But I think like a proportionally one is probably no bad idea.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_00
 I mean an absolute length is sort of a bit strange because that means that some utterances will not be changed in length.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_00
 And we had that discussion before and I'm confused myself about what I think about it.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_00
 So the fact that this is going on beyond that green line here is something that's not ideal but that's something we've just sorted out.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_00
 But this is working in general.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_00
 Does anyone have a general overview over the whole time issue like as in what date is it today?

0:15:28	SPEAKER_00
 What date do we have to have this present?

0:15:30	SPEAKER_00
 What date of the week is that and issues like that?

0:15:35	SPEAKER_00
 So the presentation is now a session.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_00
 The presentation is exactly in two weeks.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_00
 Two weeks from today.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_00
 One week from today I shall hear the freedom ring from the hills and then everything and shall then throw myself into news slavery.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_05
 I think we should start to think about evaluation.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should take the time.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should take the time.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should take the time.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_05
 I think we should take the time.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_00
 I think we should take the time.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_00
 We should probably write some user documentation because that will get us smart.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_00
 You think?

0:17:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, they'd love that time.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_01
 You should probably just write a little help file or integrate two tips that would be

0:17:17	SPEAKER_02
 visible. Yeah, I've got a basic search for.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_01
 I've got a user interface.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_01
 I'm still in my directory because the code version in the group is not the right thing.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I've not been using that.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_00
 Having said that, if we want, we could probably go back to the group directory and just use this trick, it really seems to be all about starting in the directory.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_00
 If the two of us are just working on it, it doesn't make a difference because I've already mounted the other directory now.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_01
 We should wait to have it ready for you guys to use some more to get back into the directory.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_01
 I'll try and do that to you, right?

0:18:16	SPEAKER_01
 I've got time to do something that I need to talk into and see it taking too long.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_04
 How about the summarization again?

0:18:29	SPEAKER_04
 You wanted to base it on some things length as well.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_04
 And I've got something length incorporated into my important measure at the moment.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_01
 No, in that case, it's just...

0:18:40	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if I'm going to find anything.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_04
 But if we do it twice, it wouldn't make too much sense.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_04
 No, it would be too close.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know if you want to.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure how much should be done in the program because...

0:18:59	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_01
 I think it should probably be done offline.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_03
 What?

0:19:08	SPEAKER_01
 The basic.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_01
 Combining the data.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_00
 If it's just multiplying two numbers, it can be done in the program because then we can...

0:19:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, sure.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_00
 Because what we could do is have a slide for what we can adjust as well.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, if you can figure out a way like how basically a general way because there's at least two points at which we are interested in that, how we can just have a slide bar which we can read and write to which is in a frame of that type.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_00
 That would be good.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_00
 It shouldn't be difficult.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_01
 Shouldn't I mean to just be...

0:19:37	SPEAKER_01
 You can type right here.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_01
 Right here.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but it might be more difficult.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_00
 You could, if you're lucky, you probably have to extend that class and then you can work with that value.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_00
 But if you're unlucky, it might be quicker to just write a very simple swing component which is just a bar.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_01
 You can just add it to the panel.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_01
 Like what?

0:19:59	SPEAKER_01
 Is that like a screen made swing component?

0:20:01	SPEAKER_01
 Not that a slider and maybe a diagonal.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_00
 So because we basically would be good to have two different ones to play around with one for controlling the length of the summary and another one for the merging factor.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_00
 If we do it that way with the geometric.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 Please send me a link to the type of thing.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_00
 It's just a single formula effectively.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_00
 How is the audio thing going?

0:20:33	SPEAKER_00
 Is that you're probably not having time to work on that.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_01
 Like lastly.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_01
 I can't see it.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_01
 I can use this one again.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_00
 It seems that at the moment a lot of the stuff that has to be done is sort of at the moment.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_00
 I was like, I would have, can you do this?

0:20:47	SPEAKER_00
 That's not ideal.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_01
 They have to be honest.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_01
 It's like nothing really on that map.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_01
 I've got time today, tomorrow and probably Friday.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_00
 Because I think I'm in the audio.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_00
 It's in the end.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_00
 The audio is a very important component of it.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_00
 Just because it's going to look stupid if we have everything working, but just,

0:21:13	SPEAKER_01
 yeah, it's just annoying because I need to be out on a device machine and come there. Compile under and there.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_00
 There's speech tools.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_01
 And mostly the device machines don't have working sound cards.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_01
 Mmm.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_00
 Is there any way for X forwarding sound?

0:21:34	SPEAKER_00
 No, I did.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_00
 Because that would be sort of the nice way to sit at home and have it forward the sound at the lowest bit rate to you.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, seeing that it's over broadband, it's forwarding the graphics quite okay.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_00
 It would probably like broadband wise bandwidth wise probably work out.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_01
 I did.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_01
 I did.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_01
 I did.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_00
 But it's probably not a simple thing.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_01
 Well, what I think is, I'm pretty confident that we'll just be writing this script.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_01
 And then we'll just go in as long as I can test the script once.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_01
 It's working fine.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_01
 I can just make it return-dumbing stuff so it works on other machines.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, are you not creating files anywhere like sort of real files?

0:22:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, few.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_01
 So that you can do an device machine in your panor with SSH stuff then to the sound tools on the device.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_00
 One problem with SSHing in general is that the machine that like the only gateway machines, they hate you for doing anything on them.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_00
 And there's no simple ways, I haven't found one, directly in a single step sort of SSH and then SSH again.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, I guess if you put SSH in a stick, you can give a command right after the SSH.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_00
 So if that command is SSH again.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_00
 And if you, that would require that you have all your key files set correctly, which I haven't because it always fucks up in my system.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe if you get that working, then you should be able to directly go into another machine.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_01
 If it comes to it, I'll just install that thing and stuff.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_00
 Because a primitive version of the sound to have relatively soon would be good.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_01
 I think, to be honest, I won't be a primitive in the green stage.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_00
 So to come back to the firmware before, so the reason why the summary didn't work well in the last one, it works well now is because based on the bottom data, the data is so homogenously high in its important writing that it's just sort of then everything else being equal took the first ones, more or less, but now it's working better because now it's not much more evenly distributed.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_01
 I wonder if we should do something like dropping the bottom data and remapping the lowest remaining one to zero.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_01
 It's very intense.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_01
 We're again much nicer to use than we've ever had.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_00
 The most professional way of doing it would be to map them according to the standard deviation because that would automatically always, it's sort of like the problem is it's more calculation expensive and slightly more complicated even though it's actually like in terms of calculation, it's not much.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_00
 So we have a general about standard deviation.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not used to it.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_00
 It's a very simple formula, it's basically just whatever the average of mean square differences from the mean or something, which the problem with it is that generally you first have to get the mean and only once you have the mean,

0:25:05	SPEAKER_01
 you know what? There is a way of calculating it.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_01
 In one go.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_00
 I've derived that myself.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_00
 I've derived that myself.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_00
 I didn't find it, so I did it myself and it took me a day with a formula, but then I'm slow at maths.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_00
 The good thing about that would be that if you simply say that whatever one standard deviation below the mean is zero and one standard deviation above the mean is one or two standard deviation or something, then whatever the data is like, it would always normalize.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's 45.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's not the symbols, but that's the most professional way I can think about it.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_00
 That would indirectly also drop stuff.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, that would drop whatever is below the point.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_00
 So if you find that formula, that would be good.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_00
 Otherwise, I can see if I can still understand, like I did it in my program.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_00
 It was usually stupid.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_00
 Like the standard standard deviation formula just requires you to have the mean initially and that makes some things exactly twice as computationally expensive.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_00
 And there is a way of doing it commutative.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I can't remember.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_01
 I know you're wrong.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_00
 So, yeah, so that's one possible way of doing that.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_01
 So, that's just in the loading stage, right?

0:26:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that should actually be fine, especially in the worst case, we just introduced a small hourglass, but anyway, we're only going to present this once.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_00
 And we can probably just sort of start it up before the presentation starts.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_00
 So, we shouldn't let all be worried about it.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_00
 It's actually quite beautiful.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_00
 If you want a program only to run once and only a part of it, you don't worry if it crashes afterwards.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_00
 If it wastes all the resources, if it's the hardest, it can be in.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway, I'm rambling with M.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'll just never close it.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_01
 It's a process.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_01
 No, it does not.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_00
 It does not.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_01
 I changed it.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_01
 It does not have any close process when you...

0:26:58	SPEAKER_00
 You would forget that.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_00
 That means that you would start it 15 times over in a 15-sombis running.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_00
 Does anyone know anything about which dice machines have sound cards and how to find them?

0:27:11	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_00
 Because the thing is, we can, like this at the moment, it's working because it has a sound card.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_00
 The interesting thing is that because of the structure of this, it isn't enough to just say, well, if you don't have a sound card, you don't have sound.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_00
 At least I think that's what I remember our problem was that...

0:27:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's the reason.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_00
 So I've worked around that there is ways I think to get around it, but the problem is...

0:27:36	SPEAKER_00
 So you basically have to have two code words, then one for sound card and one for non-sound card machines to test it on.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_00
 Because you have to change all sorts of other things if you don't have a sound card.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_00
 So there isn't a simple way to just tell which ones sound card machines are and just use sound card machines.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_05
 No, no, no.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_05
 That makes it really quite difficult for us if you want to...

0:27:57	SPEAKER_05
...and start as deaf and first have to fight for a computer.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but I guess, I mean, if you trust in Dave's summary for the audio, just putting all these things into sound, then having a written summary.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I just care for the written one.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_05
 That's the key to the written one.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so I think that it's the clock.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_00
 So I think that it's really the easiest way to make a sound card and a non-sound card version of it.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think we should call that, we'll run it on the sound card version.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but then that means that the girls can't test it.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_00
 That's the problem.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, we can.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_01
 All that happens is if a few people have to load the clock, you still get the display.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, but without the clock, you don't have...

0:28:36	SPEAKER_00
 Well, actually you're right, it doesn't strictly have to do any movement.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you can still click on the segment.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_01
 And that is still the...

0:28:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but we have to comment stuff out for that.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_00
 I think, like, at the moment, if you click on a segment, it automatically sets the whole clock thing going and stuff.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to comment out stuff.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_00
 So that's what I'm saying, that there is...

0:28:56	SPEAKER_00
 We could make it a flag, couldn't we?

0:28:58	SPEAKER_00
 We could just make it a runtime flag and then make a few ifs and say if...

0:29:02	SPEAKER_01
 It must be a way of detecting the clock load.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, there is.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_01
 There is try and set something on the clock and try and catch and then make the clock be accepted and set the flag.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so anyway, so that's something we should probably do in one way or another because it seems to have the overwhelming majority of lives machines don't have sound cards.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, you want to have a look at the agreement and disagreement data that I worked on last week.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_05
 Do you have anything more on this?

0:29:42	SPEAKER_00
 No, nothing but much to talk about this.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_00
 So apart from, like, a search box and the similarity thing, what's that case?

0:29:51	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just going to go over that. This is more or less in the end, like, this is very similar to what our product will look like in the end.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_00
 Seeing that realistically with a given timeframe, we're not going to do amazing new things from now on.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_00
 So I'll be, we'll hopefully be...

0:30:05	SPEAKER_05
 Paps my list of agreements.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_05
 Paps my list of agreements somewhere.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_00
 List of agreements?

0:30:12	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_05
 If we find them good enough...

0:30:18	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_05
 I wanted to provide that an extra list saying probability agreement.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think it would be good in the day for...

0:30:29	SPEAKER_00
 It could be good in the display to annotate them in the display.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, for example, yeah.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we could just make...

0:30:34	SPEAKER_01
 Click on the point in time and display.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_00
 Not just yet, but that should... That's actually, that's probably the only thing I can say I can do this week because that should be...

0:30:42	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, I'll do it in an inefficient way. I'll effectively sort of go through all the segments and check if they actually come.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_00
 I think they, what we should do is that...

0:30:51	SPEAKER_00
 That time click of the clock. I think that's changeable.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_00
 And I think we should probably increase that because at the moment it's 0.1 seconds.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_00
 And that's just... There is actually some background noise when it's working.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_00
 I think that it's because it's like doing so much every time.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'll get that one screen.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's probably because...

0:31:11	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure if you have the version with the display yet, where the display is actually updating up here when it's moving on.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_00
 So I mean, yes, it is because my display is programmed in efficiency, but I think with it to give time constraints, it's probably easy instead of making a very efficient display code to just make the clock whatever 0.5 seconds or something.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_00
 Do you want to monitor?

0:31:30	SPEAKER_01
 As long as you can skip more accurately than the times that that's fine.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_01
 Because otherwise you might risk cutting it.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_01
 If I can skip more accurately than if you want to jump to a point, you need to be able to jump more accurately than half second by half second in this word.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_03
 Alright.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_04
 I would still say that idea that we want to display bars for individual speakers.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_04
 It's a bit small, but I don't know why that is.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_01
 Oh yeah, I can see.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_00
 That's probably because it's coming from my resolution and it's given much higher resolution.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_05
 Perhaps because it's white screen or something.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, what you see here in this part is, no mouse.

0:32:37	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, here is a list of the most important or most probable words that are pure in agreement.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_05
 So the number in the first brackets is.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_05
 So I run it on all the B, D, B, M, R and B, R, O meetings to learn it.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_05
 So the number in the first brackets is how often it occurred in the.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_05
 Atrances that were annotated as agreements by the.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_05
 I look at the human and the number in the second brackets is how much it occurred in the West.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_05
 And the first number in every line is how much more often that is per same.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_05
 Same text length.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_05
 So the number that gives it look quite good, I think it's exciting, perfect, true, interesting, exactly correct, super and so on.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_05
 And then I run it on the first meeting getting the.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_05
 So what's in the in the brackets in this window here is the atrances.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_05
 And at the moment it can make any differences between.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, you get the same value for every atrances that is exactly your every atrances that is sure.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_05
 And for the longer atrances, I just look how often.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_05
 One of these words is in there and simply added up.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_05
 So that should in principle favor longer atrances.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_05
 And yeah, and so these numbers here, one or zero this year, and that's.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_05
 The dialogue at labels, whether it's.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_05
 If they're annotated as agreement, they're not zero here.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_05
 So here for those who get to get a very high score, they're mostly not zero.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_05
 And some of those who are zero are still very good.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_05
 Like I definitely agree.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_05
 It's nice.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_05
 Can't agree with that.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_05
 We probably want to have.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_05
 And when you get further down, you see those with very low.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_05
 And then you put score also had.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_05
 No agreements.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_00
 Again, I think that's probably good part if we had a slide bar initially where we could dynamically adapt the threshold of what we.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, so maybe it's just like maybe it's just good to have like some generic component with three slide bars or something where we can relatively easily add a fourth one or something, you know.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_00
 And she's like sort of all our fiddle factors.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_01
 And obviously we'll hide that in the presentation.

0:35:58	SPEAKER_00
 It depends. We could look in some cases, we could put it as a feature and say, you know, you can dynamically.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_01
 Like we don't want. I don't think we want to have it supposed to be easier to do anything by adding the threshold.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_00
 We wouldn't call it threshold.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_00
 The granularity of decision.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_00
 Something like it.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_00
 So decision.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_00
 And everything above that threshold. I could then at the entrance where it occurs.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_00
 Just put a certain graphic light and like a handshake or something cool.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_05
 So it looks quite good. I think.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_05
 So that's what I got for agreement. Then for disagreement. I did also, but it's a bit more difficult because there's so little disagreement.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah. So I use again see the list, but it's much shorter and it's much much worse.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yes. I was just thinking the same like it's so tempting.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_00
 Smiles.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_00
 You have yellow smiley and yellow angry faces.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_00
 Beautiful.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_05
 And that is here. The list of utterances.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_05
 It gets us for the first meeting.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_00
 Didn't somebody say that actually like a lot of agreements have have actual words which have such disagreements like.

0:37:15	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah. I mean, I think that's why we have that right. It's so high here.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_01
 So can you.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_01
 I think I think.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:37:27	SPEAKER_05
 Thanks also.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:37:29	SPEAKER_05
 It's higher in the non-agreement than in the agreement.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_01
 And there's some fine things.

0:37:39	SPEAKER_05
 Yes. Yeah. That's the fact.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_01
 I'm getting a.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah. It's just. I mean, it's exactly this thing, but just.

0:37:49	SPEAKER_05
 I would just have to rescale this factor here.

0:37:53	SPEAKER_05
 And I mean, this is the dialogue.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, okay.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_01
 So I could probably read it.

0:38:01	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I can just give it to you in the format you want.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_01
 So I would just.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_01
 And then score. Yeah. This was just for showing it.

0:38:11	SPEAKER_01
 In one file.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_01
 In the first place, it's going to one file. It makes it easier.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_00
 If they're corresponding it for each thing, yeah, they should be right.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_00
 So for each utterance, you have one agreement, one disagreement.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_00
 So I'll read that into.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_01
 I'll make it part of the get measure thing.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_01
 You can just guess it with a flag.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_01
 You can get measure.

0:38:36	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. Yeah.

0:38:37	SPEAKER_01
 The one where we have.

0:38:38	SPEAKER_01
 Zero is the idea one is.

0:38:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. Yeah.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_01
 Cooled word.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_00
 You know what? If you can.

0:38:47	SPEAKER_00
 If you introduce like a sort of a static, what's it called?

0:38:51	SPEAKER_00
 Public static ints are basically constant.

0:38:53	SPEAKER_00
 Like that's Java, so I'll give them names.

0:38:57	SPEAKER_00
 Like so zero TD idea one that probably makes the code a lot more readable for everybody's thing around with it.

0:39:03	SPEAKER_00
 You know what I mean?

0:39:04	SPEAKER_00
 So just like whatever three means agreement value and then I just write something agreement and then it's easier to understand for both of us what's going on.

0:39:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_05
 One problem I still have is with all the years because I mean, obviously they're all right at the same.

0:39:22	SPEAKER_05
 I was thinking perhaps at looking at the acoustic modules.

0:39:29	SPEAKER_05
 I have so for example, at my F zero deviation.

0:39:34	SPEAKER_05
 But yeah, by now I just had a look at the data.

0:39:40	SPEAKER_05
 And actually the average.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_05
 F zero deviation is only slightly higher for the positive ones than for the negative ones.

0:39:53	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, there is a difference, but that's probably not significant enough to really make use of it.

0:40:00	SPEAKER_05
 But I would also investigate some.

0:40:04	SPEAKER_05
 But I would also.

0:40:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's occurring.

0:40:08	SPEAKER_01
 Not only of the agreements that really frequently as like encouragement as well.

0:40:12	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, so and I my hypothesis was that if it's really yeah, I like agreement it will sound different than if.

0:40:22	SPEAKER_05
 Then if it is just the back turn.

0:40:25	SPEAKER_00
 But you know what I think we should put the threshold for that one in the end quite high anyway.

0:40:28	SPEAKER_00
 So probably doesn't make much of a difference because I think this thing.

0:40:31	SPEAKER_05
 But that has nothing to do with a threshold.

0:40:34	SPEAKER_05
 Because you have you don't have it on you with years you have it also with words that are much higher ranked.

0:40:42	SPEAKER_05
 You have the same problem like for example with yep as much higher ranked because it's because that's often in the training thing.

0:40:53	SPEAKER_00
 But I mean the fact that different ones have the same number in itself isn't a problem is it?

0:40:59	SPEAKER_05
 No, it's only if they're used in different contexts.

0:41:04	SPEAKER_00
 So if for every year you'd be sure that it's an agreement and that wouldn't be a problem.

0:41:10	SPEAKER_00
 So you're saying that you're not sure if every year person agreement.

0:41:14	SPEAKER_05
 Yes, I know that not every year person agreement because this right yeah and okay things are typically also a picture.

0:41:25	SPEAKER_01
 What's the highest rank from that kind of person?

0:41:30	SPEAKER_01
 Because if it's below about crescendos one that's in late season.

0:41:34	SPEAKER_01
 It's below like 50.

0:41:37	SPEAKER_01
 That's probably high-backing.

0:41:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but we would throw a lot away that are quite good.

0:41:44	SPEAKER_01
 If you would set it.

0:41:47	SPEAKER_01
 It's really tight quite tight.

0:41:48	SPEAKER_01
 So then that's a bit occur on one set as a behind the rank.

0:41:53	SPEAKER_00
 So over how many different over which length is this now this is like.

0:42:00	SPEAKER_00
 So the third column is the utterance where it occurs right?

0:42:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:42:04	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so I think we really do have to put the threshold quite quite high then because otherwise you get.

0:42:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, because I was just checking you know like how far apart are they at the moment.

0:42:15	SPEAKER_00
 That's definitely not a good thing to display if they're like an average 10 10 utterances apart or something.

0:42:22	SPEAKER_01
 So we won't probably want to take a threshold at least with US 60.

0:42:27	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:42:30	SPEAKER_01
 Looking at that.

0:42:32	SPEAKER_05
 I think for this meeting the lower closet around 90 annotated agreements or yeah agreement.

0:42:45	SPEAKER_01
 I mean the best ones are definitely those on the first screen.

0:43:05	SPEAKER_00
 So again I'd say probably a good way of going about that question is to have control which we can vary in the distance.

0:43:20	SPEAKER_00
 And then just sort of because that's in the end how it's going to be evaluated.

0:43:23	SPEAKER_00
 You know in the end this is kind of like I mean we're going to present it and say yeah so this is our it's just his agreement and then we see what what looks good and what looks.

0:43:31	SPEAKER_00
 We are like something in between three and five agreements but not more probably maybe less but not much less and I think that I think that I have to be wanting everything.

0:43:45	SPEAKER_05
 I mean we have to put them because some of them are also I mean this is just added by different speakers for example there immediately following one another is just two speakers agreeing I think same for this one here.

0:44:04	SPEAKER_00
 I think that will be up to kill emerged anyway.

0:44:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yes but maybe an expensive well maybe in a stupid looking way though.

0:44:21	SPEAKER_00
 I think they can probably be done on display level.

0:44:36	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's always really funny.

0:44:52	SPEAKER_05
 I only keep the stuff I actually need on it and then I clean it up every you know my god but actually this or here is an SSD because it was data that didn't fit on my quote anymore.

0:45:15	SPEAKER_04
 So I think that's why we wanted to have keyless winched topics like that or something.

0:45:26	SPEAKER_00
 I think sort of the bottom line in which might well end up what it's going to be like is that we take the single higher strength utterance and put that as a title like realistically looking at this from the time we have left to do this and stuff.

0:45:41	SPEAKER_04
 What I do is having values reach segment at the moment so I could just extract the highest ones for each segment.

0:45:51	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know if that's good but at least I could provide some value.

0:46:00	SPEAKER_00
 Is that on a word basis would that be single word so would that be check out what they would be like on a word basis maybe actually if there's one word which is very typical I mean probably somewhere like because that's like the only time that air was spelled with 3a and stuff.

0:46:17	SPEAKER_00
 I think that might be a problem of the whole meditation that if they aren't exactly consistent in how they describe transcribed stuff like that.

0:46:31	SPEAKER_01
 So I think that's why it's high but then probably it's the only time that mmm was spelled with a dot at the end and stuff.

0:46:50	SPEAKER_00
 I have dictionaries if it's just like I have arbitrary really long lists from the British National Corpus of when you do not include.

0:47:02	SPEAKER_00
 Well let's say at least it is consistently enough that I think you can filter them out fairly well.

0:47:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah I mean if the single best one word for a segment is interesting that would be really good.

0:47:30	SPEAKER_01
 It seems to be actually I think each of the highest three or four and then just merge into one of the ones.

0:47:46	SPEAKER_00
 We're going backwards you know suddenly crash. Yeah I mean that was that was sort of in the original content in the nice fancy drawing that we gave Stephen.

0:48:00	SPEAKER_00
 I mean that was part of it that sort of within a segment you had this top segment and each of them had different words and whatever have proud dreams.

0:48:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah other assignment. No I don't think we have.

0:48:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah we're going to have time to make it display like a whole archive of it because it's going to be displaying single meeting in order and having a lot of care.

0:48:29	SPEAKER_00
 Poohman solution is probably going to be to have a list.

0:48:38	SPEAKER_01
 You're think of loading them all at once.

0:48:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:48:50	SPEAKER_02
 I'm just going to show you a little bit of the dialogue I used to start a zero speech meeting.

0:49:02	SPEAKER_05
 Even though we were provided by all the weapons.

0:49:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah I think that like the drawings we changed anyway.

0:49:28	SPEAKER_00
 So performance wise it generally works fine for the display should make much of different because I think everything in the display code is just from the first on to the last one displayed so if the other performance is okay then we should really just load the whole thing in.

0:49:45	SPEAKER_01
 The first thing we will have to do is we want to really want a different behavior that we clicked on a whole meeting and a segment so if there's more than one meeting displayed it should be clicked even on one of the segments of that meeting and it should really naturalize and just play after that meeting.

0:50:12	SPEAKER_00
 See that probably just means that the display sort of has an internal knowledge about what level of zoom it has so initially the display.

0:50:20	SPEAKER_01
 It just needs to know whether it's displaying more than one whole meeting.

0:50:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:50:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:50:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah that's probably fairly simple actually if we do it in that most primitive way of just saying as long as it's play more than one meeting.

0:50:45	SPEAKER_01
 I guess sufficient to claim that we're going to have some kind of real major.

0:50:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:50:52	SPEAKER_00
 We then need some way of getting back up again in the hierarchy but that in the worst cases will just be a static sort of error button in the right hand top or corner of the display and you press that and then you're on the display the whole thing again.

0:51:04	SPEAKER_00
 But for that at the moment my display code needs that thing to work the one.

0:51:12	SPEAKER_00
 Oh no that's working at the moment anyway the one that I just say give me 100 values over that length and then you're internally.

0:51:19	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:51:20	SPEAKER_00
 That's okay as long as my display I was just thinking my display can't handle displaying a million different segments but no but it doesn't have to.

0:51:28	SPEAKER_00
 Even now it doesn't have to. Okay well that's all details and Dave can you just turn this what we have right now.

0:51:38	SPEAKER_01
 You want me to put a search in?

0:51:43	SPEAKER_01
 I'll probably tonight just work on getting a frozen version that looks consistently.

0:51:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:51:51	SPEAKER_01
 Make a good document.

0:51:59	SPEAKER_01
 Anyone feels that they have free time.

0:52:09	SPEAKER_00
 One thing that would be convenient for all sorts of things in which I haven't found out about it is how to do tooltips in an arbitrary way in in swing graphic as well.

0:52:20	SPEAKER_00
 Now there are simple ways of doing tooltips over a given element like if a button they just give it a tool tip text but there is means of doing tooltips that I put my mouse over that's a problem I was over this line here and then it would tell me something about what it is.

0:52:34	SPEAKER_00
 And that would be quite convenient for a lot of things because then we can sort of have a lot of information in the display in the way that just went over it.

0:52:42	SPEAKER_00
 But I haven't figured out how it works and that's something that probably, so if everyone is ever bored or if anyone feels that they can do that.

0:52:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay so probably what you'd want to do is the text where the mouse is and change the default to the left component.

0:53:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yes but it automatically displays the correct position when you hover.

0:53:06	SPEAKER_00
 But the thing is it isn't simply an act of setting a string default tool tip.

0:53:12	SPEAKER_00
 There seems to be something about a tool tip object that you have to create and give it all sorts of different properties and stuff.

0:53:17	SPEAKER_01
 You might not really want to create an E and a time to do that.

0:53:21	SPEAKER_00
 So anyway I haven't looked much into that so if anybody looks into that then let me know otherwise I'll start looking into it as soon as I have time again.

0:53:29	SPEAKER_00
 But if anybody...

0:53:30	SPEAKER_01
 I'll have a look at some of my jobs that might be so similar to that.

0:53:34	SPEAKER_00
 I found some stuff about it on the web and it just looked to me like proper coding.

0:53:40	SPEAKER_00
 I saw half page code samples which effectively just displayed a tool tip and I didn't have the time at that point to get deeper into that.

0:53:47	SPEAKER_00
 So if anybody gets any good samples of that.

0:53:52	SPEAKER_00
 Anyways is that it for now?

0:53:55	SPEAKER_01
 Is that all version all in there?

0:53:59	SPEAKER_00
 No but I'm going up up with the tower now and I have my external heart disc so I can...

0:54:05	SPEAKER_00
 So I'll start working half-n Any dice machines in this building?

0:54:22	SPEAKER_00
 I actually know what I have to go there anyway and put a piece of paper onto machines where some stuff is running on.

0:54:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah and I think like I'll just kick in full time for another SSD next week because there's nothing I have to do then.

0:54:42	SPEAKER_00
 Part of the cognitive modeling which I think I'll just do in 5 hours, 3 hours.

0:54:48	SPEAKER_00
 You take a look at that.

0:54:50	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah but not too detailed.

0:54:54	SPEAKER_00
 I might just not go for the last question because usually the last question is what takes half the time and gives you 5% of it.

0:55:01	SPEAKER_02
 Okay yes we're going to talk about the evaluation next week.

0:55:08	SPEAKER_01
 We really need to get in contact with other great consumers that you want to enjoy without your own team.

0:55:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, that's good.

0:55:20	SPEAKER_02
 I think that is no interesting.

0:55:25	SPEAKER_04
 I think that's all the way through.

0:55:28	SPEAKER_01
 I think they're names and little games in there.

0:55:31	SPEAKER_01
 They do send the game in there because I was hoping that Steve would eventually get the game.

0:55:36	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe he has mentioned it to them but they just never talked to them.

0:55:44	SPEAKER_00
 I'm still coming as a shock to me now because I was in this mindset.

0:55:47	SPEAKER_00
 I first knew there was a lot of time between the presentation and the report and then I knew now the presentation has shifted.

0:55:54	SPEAKER_00
 The correlation between those two facts is interdependencies.

0:55:58	SPEAKER_00
 There's some fancy planning language about that.

0:56:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, it is probably some version of the frame problem.

0:56:08	SPEAKER_00
 Frame problem.

0:56:11	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's time to get them all bad.

0:56:21	SPEAKER_05
 By the way, how long, how much time do we have for the presentation?

0:56:26	SPEAKER_02
 Probably as long as we need.

0:56:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but more like 20 minutes or more like an hour.

0:56:39	SPEAKER_05
 I reckon that if you present the components or what is it based on, then you will need more than 20 minutes to present it.

0:56:47	SPEAKER_00
 But if you just present the functionality of the thing, I don't think this presentation is about the internal workings.

0:56:54	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's about the overall It's a demo.

0:57:03	SPEAKER_01
 I think realistically since everything in this university works in one hour slots and stuff.

0:57:07	SPEAKER_01
 It's two groups and it's probably roughly half an hour-ish and 10 minutes without the point.

0:57:14	SPEAKER_00
 This is going to be so bad. There's going to be some small...

0:57:19	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you should present it on your laptop.

0:57:23	SPEAKER_00
 It's really bad at the moment.

0:57:27	SPEAKER_00
 Plus we would have to get the speech tools running on my laptop.

0:57:31	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, let's see.

0:57:36	SPEAKER_00
 It could just be flooned on the laptop for all I know.

0:57:40	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, at the moment it's not too bad apart from... I think the sound is stuttering.

0:57:44	SPEAKER_00
 I think because of the laptop.

0:57:47	SPEAKER_01
 We can only really touch that once we have sound.

0:57:51	SPEAKER_01
 I'm pretty sure I think that's the best option.

0:57:57	SPEAKER_00
 How fast is Rokar?

0:57:59	SPEAKER_05
 I can't hear that.

0:58:01	SPEAKER_05
 It doesn't have to be enough.

0:58:03	SPEAKER_00
 When that pins would run on anything but...

0:58:08	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, J-Dader.

0:58:10	SPEAKER_01
 Is that you?

0:58:11	SPEAKER_01
 You shouldn't even die.

0:58:13	SPEAKER_00
 No, that's true.

0:58:15	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not going to be fine.

0:58:23	SPEAKER_00
 Oh crap.

0:58:24	SPEAKER_00
 That's something that would rely on...

0:58:28	SPEAKER_00
 I just don't think it's a good idea to run the speech tools in sequence.

0:58:35	SPEAKER_01
 No, but the sequence should run the Java as well.

0:58:41	SPEAKER_00
 Wherever this is going, it doesn't sound good.

0:58:50	SPEAKER_00
 You can use my laptop as a server.

0:58:53	SPEAKER_00
 That's a sound server, but that would mean that we have to get the speech tools running on this.

0:58:58	SPEAKER_00
 I think the way Java works is that...

0:59:04	SPEAKER_00
 I think it'll run on their dies machine if we're doing it.

0:59:08	SPEAKER_00
 We should definitely test it the day before.

0:59:11	SPEAKER_02
 I'll show you where I'll say test art.

0:59:23	SPEAKER_00
 Are you going to make something primitive that people can load the day down?

0:59:27	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:59:28	SPEAKER_01
 I'll make a script to run it and put that in the group.

0:59:33	SPEAKER_01
 I'll send it on the open.

0:59:39	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not 100% sure what needs to be changed to make it work with the...

0:59:45	SPEAKER_00
 To make it not crash if it doesn't have a sound card.

0:59:48	SPEAKER_00
 There's quite a bit you have to comment out for that.

0:59:52	SPEAKER_01
 Just too because...

0:59:53	SPEAKER_01
 Don't be the bit, like, the clock.

0:59:55	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, is that stuff in the display as well?

0:59:58	SPEAKER_00
 The thing is the display calls methods which probably expect some...

1:00:03	SPEAKER_00
 I think if the display itself isn't doing anything clockey, so as long as in the main program manager everything clockey is removed, it might be worthwhile to check how much more work it would be to do it over a flag, because then in the end, otherwise we always have two code works and people might be changing the wrong one.

1:00:22	SPEAKER_01
 Really, you shouldn't even need a flag.

1:00:24	SPEAKER_01
 You should be able to do it with exceptions.

1:00:26	SPEAKER_01
 That's kind of not a nice extension of the main program.

1:00:30	SPEAKER_00
 I know that if you don't do it with exceptions, you have to get pressure.

1:00:34	SPEAKER_00
 So, figure it out.

1:00:35	SPEAKER_00
 If you don't have a sound card, it's a pressure system.

1:00:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, cool.

1:00:41	SPEAKER_02
 Did you see in the program manager, do you have a method to set the current ID to update the display?

1:00:49	SPEAKER_02
 Because that's what I'm going to need to put in there to get the result.

1:00:53	SPEAKER_01
 I know it's going to have to be something a bit more complicated than that.

1:00:56	SPEAKER_01
 What it will have to do is be registered everything as time handlers and then update and then re-register.

1:01:05	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

1:01:06	SPEAKER_00
 I think the display has some method for it.

1:01:08	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure if it's for the program manager to call.

1:01:11	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not actually 100% sure what it's called, but the display has some method where you tell it where to start in the trend.

1:01:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's kind of easy.

1:01:23	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, well, I suppose I've got the moment of middle result class.

1:01:26	SPEAKER_02
 It's got the ID.

1:01:28	SPEAKER_02
 Have you got a component?

1:01:29	SPEAKER_01
 Just playing lists of matches.

1:01:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's good.

1:01:33	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I'm working on it.

1:01:36	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, yeah.

1:01:37	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it's not too hard to do.

1:01:39	SPEAKER_01
 All you have to do is be registered everything as time handler for us before you add this stuff in.

1:01:46	SPEAKER_01
 But when you click on the search result, we definitely want that one.

1:01:54	SPEAKER_00
 Well, actually, day, day, day, day, day.

1:01:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and it might not be there.

1:01:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

1:01:59	SPEAKER_02
 I was thinking it might be a problem.

1:02:01	SPEAKER_00
 I was thinking it's exactly the same thing that happens when we say set selection.

1:02:05	SPEAKER_00
 It's not, but actually set selection does everything you want sort of.

1:02:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, if you look at set selection,

1:02:12	SPEAKER_00
 set selection doesn't update the display though because, you know, well, it doesn't tell the display which part to display because the display has just called set selection.

1:02:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it doesn't matter because it is jumped to any text area.

1:02:29	SPEAKER_01
 If text area, then the line will jump.

1:02:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but that only works.

1:02:34	SPEAKER_00
 That at the moment isn't done through our system.

1:02:36	SPEAKER_00
 That's just done because then the time changes.

1:02:39	SPEAKER_00
 It's actually a time change would automatically put the position in the display in the right of the play.

1:02:44	SPEAKER_00
 No, but that's not a good idea because that could well be outside the display area then.

1:02:50	SPEAKER_01
 And also the real time and play time stuff to change.

1:02:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so yeah, we need to read and visualize the display.

1:02:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and I think the display has a method for that ready, which is called...

1:03:05	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway, the display is something useful for that.

1:03:09	SPEAKER_00
 Something that first starts with the word set.

1:03:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you can set the windows start utterance and window end utterance.

1:03:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

1:03:25	SPEAKER_01
 But yeah, we need to read something to ensure that the set result is in the summary.

1:03:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

1:03:31	SPEAKER_01
 That's crazy.

1:03:32	SPEAKER_01
 So we probably want a different summary constructor that takes an additional argument as an ID.

1:03:42	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, that reference will always be in the summary.

1:03:45	SPEAKER_00
 Alternative videos are always the method of just giving it a really high score.

1:03:49	SPEAKER_00
 There's a hack in order to...

1:03:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's right.

1:03:53	SPEAKER_01
 As long as you then don't...

1:03:54	SPEAKER_00
 Well, probably people wouldn't know it.

1:03:55	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's not a nice way.

1:04:03	SPEAKER_00
 You could put 1.1 when the other ones only got the one.

1:04:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's right.

1:04:08	SPEAKER_00
 But no, it's not a nice way.

1:04:10	SPEAKER_02
 I'm just saying.

1:04:11	SPEAKER_02
 When you're doing a search, you keep the slides from soon back out.

1:04:14	SPEAKER_02
 So you've got the full text for that statement.

1:04:17	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that may be rather than a summary.

1:04:20	SPEAKER_02
 Because that is maybe what you want everywhere user.

1:04:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, probably that's actually true that if you're doing a search, you're usually not interested in a condensed way, but in the full thing anyway.

1:04:29	SPEAKER_01
 You provide the option deep in the sheet.

1:04:32	SPEAKER_05
 Otherwise, it would be too complicated to cope with the system if you have to readjust it to a different zoom level to get better results.

1:04:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, probably.

1:04:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but we have strange in the eyes of the user.

1:04:45	SPEAKER_01
 We need to make a summary that's the same length as the selection.

1:04:51	SPEAKER_01
 And that would ensure the search term came up.

1:04:54	SPEAKER_01
 Alright.

1:04:55	SPEAKER_00
 I think proportion...

1:04:57	SPEAKER_00
 Even though I'm always getting myself confused about this, but I think sort of making the summary length, I think generally proportioned like as a proportional factor of its original length is a good way of going about it.

1:05:09	SPEAKER_00
 Anything with absolute length, sort of stupid because that means that a long, long segment gets to 1% of its length and another one gets to exactly the same length.

1:05:17	SPEAKER_00
 So if you're doing it by proportion, then just having 1.0 or something makes it very easy to always end up at...

1:05:24	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, that's what I currently like. The current code just takes the tenth of the summary length.

1:05:29	SPEAKER_00
 So we'll have a swag.

1:05:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

1:05:32	SPEAKER_00
 And that's the type of slider that we can actually leave in and show, because that's functionality.

1:05:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's sort of like your level of zoom of impending doom.

1:05:44	SPEAKER_00
 Shall we quit here?

1:05:46	SPEAKER_00
 Anything to be discussed?

1:05:51	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so I'm going to copy my stuff.

1:05:54	SPEAKER_01
 And also I'll work on site, please.

1:05:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, otherwise you'll definitely see me in MFM, so I'll just...

1:06:29	None
 Yeah, I'll just copy it.

1:06:32	None
 Yeah, I just actually...

1:06:33	None
 I'm sort of for staying because I couldn't really get out of my teaser, but I'm going to get more...

1:06:40	None
 No, I don't have to give you out of the zoom.

1:06:43	None
 I am not really aware of the...

1:06:46	None
 So, MFM can be made...

1:06:53	None
 No, no, I'm not in the bottom.

1:06:56	None
 So we started breakout one, and we were going to take things to work with you, but I didn't take very long time.

1:07:05	None
 So it didn't look to me like, you weren't doing an overly thorough construction, where the unit was very fixed.

1:07:13	None
 Mar baller's ho...

1:07:42	None
 And I think...
