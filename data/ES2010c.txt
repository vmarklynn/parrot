0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 Both lawyer, both mano Hamp opened

0:00:08	SPEAKER_02
 to you

0:00:14	SPEAKER_04
 We're on

0:00:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, hi team. Hope you had a good lunch. Okay, we're back for the conceptual design meeting. Let's get started. Okay, here's the agenda for today's meeting. We're going to open it, and I'm going to keep the minutes as project manager. We're going to have three presentations one from each of you again. Then we are going to come to decision on their remote control concepts, and then we're going to close it up. We have 40 minutes again. Okay, and just to reiterate, after this meeting, the team will reach a decision on the concepts of their remote control. Okay, let's go ahead and start off with your presentations. Who would like to go first? Just trying to move mine right now. Okay, Courtney, would you mind starting yourself? Yeah. Okay, good.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_03
 Transmatching? Yeah. Okay, so, trend watching. Since we do put the fashion electronics, it is kind of important how our product looks. So I guess we can go ahead and go next. So, what they want right now, customers want fancy versus functional, basically about 58% of what they, like of the product that they want, describing like the, in order of how much they want 58% of the decision of what it should look like, fancy versus functional.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_03
 And then it has to also be technologically innovative and yet easy to use. So the customer basically is confused. They don't know exactly what they want. They want us to tell them.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_03
 They want everything. Exactly. So we can go next. Okay, so in Milan and Paris recently, the trends have been showing that clothing, shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns. So I don't know if we want to go with that. And also the spongy feel is in contrast to last year. I don't know really. I mean, I guess the sponge could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff. You don't want like a softer touch. I mean, you guys know what I mean? Right. Yeah. But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns, I don't know if we really want to go with that because it is just a trend. And our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months. Right. Because people don't buy a new one. Yeah. I mean, that could just be a spring thing right now. I can address some of that issue, I think, with my presentation. Okay. Awesome. So design preferences, we need easy to read like large buttons clearly labeled. So I mean, because we talked about that being a problem. And then also buttons illuminating upon touch. You said that in your design with the bulb. And that could also tie in with the color scheme. We need the real reaction logo. The color scheme obviously. That's one of our key goals. We want to promote our product.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_03
 And I was thinking about different types of designs. And I came up with something actually right here. So what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone like this where we put the buttons around like we put a big on off button or something else in the middle.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down. And then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape. Because that it'll appeal to older generation.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_03
 Like you said, retro is cool. So it's classically retro. So I mean, that's just an idea.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_02
 You guys like it. Ready for the next slide? Yep. And that's it. Okay. Great. Great presentation.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_00
 Ready? Okay, here. See if it's there. Which one is it? I don't know.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know. Interface concepts? No. Interface concepts. Either refresh it or wait, maybe I didn't put it in there. Hang on. Mine will always read copy of something rather. Sorry?

0:05:05	SPEAKER_01
 I copied mine before I sent it in. Okay. Sorry.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_00
 There we go.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. Looking at the interface concept, it's going to be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this. If you want to start the next slide, sure.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_00
 You can't really see it, but there's two possible ways on the left. If you see it on the sides of the remote, you have the sort of scroll down. So you have that option right there. And then also this is the idea of the base.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_00
 Sort of like an idea there. And then on the right, you have what's really big trend right now is the iPods becoming really fast thing.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_00
 And so you have this sort of very, very simplistic menu section with the round buttons. And it's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip, but also very sleek and very simple, but technologically advanced.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_00
 So if you want to do that, and we can find a way of sort of like using that idea into about controlling, sort of looking to it, maybe next. There's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by sight.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_00
 You know, you're in the dark, you don't want it. You're looking at the remote controls. And the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button, it's a V. And so you're kind of feeling a V like volume up.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_00
 What it really is is a V. And what you think it is is down because the down arrow.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_00
 And so it's like sort of Christmas, you'd probably turn that with the other way up.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_00
 But then you have, you could either do it by raise type, which could be, you know, iffy sort of old fashioned in a way.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_00
 Either that or just have it by shape, for example, you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_00
 And then the round ones you sort of feel by, you know, this second one down, that sort of thing.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_00
 So it's sort of looking into how we wanted to do it by feel.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_00
 This is sort of an example of going for a certain demographic.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_00
 This is particularly the gear towards children. That's cute.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_00
 We move.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_00
 It's very cute. We could probably change it to yellow, bright yellow for like the company logo.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_00
 You have the shapes, it's very simplistic and friendly looking.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_00
 And then the other thing that you would be able to do is just to be a, you'd program certain channels that only this children watch.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_00
 So it's like the watch, you know, the CBB, so something like that.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_00
 Keeping it away from other channels. So that's like another arrow.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_00
 These are three examples sort of looking at it. You have the wider section for the main controls there.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_00
 So you can see how many buttons there are. And then on the left, you have an example of the round buttons and a simpler design.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_00
 On the bottom, we probably wouldn't need that because it's more for like a DVD function, which we're not going to be using.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_00
 So again, it's sort of like just giving you ideas. And then down at the bottom, you have the logos.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_00
 And that's where you could put the RR real reaction.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_00
 And then finally, these are like the sort of same examples, but also some more just possibilities that we can go with.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_00
 None of them are particularly keen on, by the way.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_00
 But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying, well, out of this one, we like, you know, the round section.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_00
 Or we like the button size on this.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_02
 Or I like, you know, the black finish, I just still be finished.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_03
 Right. I have four of those from out.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. Ready? That's it.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. Great job.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, my turn.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. What's the title?

0:09:30	SPEAKER_01
 It'll be copy of component design.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. That looks like it.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_01
 So basic remote operation runs as follows. Press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_01
 Chip sends is the connection. Chip produces a more code infrared signal specific to that button.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_01
 So you press the button and produces a signal that's encoded specifically for that button.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_01
 Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the TV center, which interprets the signal and responds accordingly, changes channel, etc.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_01
 So that being said, next slide please.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_01
 Findings, which were the required materials for the basic internal construction.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_01
 So all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed, we need rubber for buttons, aluminum for battery contacts, integrated circuit, which consists of a diode transistor, resonator, resistors, and a capacitor.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_01
 All those basic things that make a circuit function.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_01
 Fiberglass and think-up or wire to create the actual circuit board itself.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_01
 And LED, which is a light emitting diode.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_01
 Contact disks for the buttons, plastic for the casing and a power source, whatever power source we've actually determined we want.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_01
 Next slide please.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_01
 Personal preferences. To save money for the components, the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought on mass.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_01
 If we find another company who can produce the required chips, casing LED, any additional materials we decide we require, add less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing we should go for it.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_01
 Next slide please.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_01
 Just talking to the manufacturing division.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_01
 They suggested power options, solar cells, hand, dynamo, and kinetic power. So you shake it and increases the power.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works. They have yet to get back to me on that.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_01
 So next slide please.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_01
 Suggested casing options.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. We can offer options for casing such as straight curved, double curved, you know, very specific to the customer.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_01
 Options for materials, plastic rubber, titanium wood.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think anyone's going to go for a wood one because- It's amazing.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's fun to listen.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_01
 Certain restrictions do apply here though. Latex, you can't do solar power with a latex one.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_01
 So if they want soft squishy rubber, they can't have the solar power adoption.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_01
 Double curved, you can't do titanium.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_01
 That would be two curvature. So it would actually- If the shape of your hand you curve here and you curve here.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_01
 So you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_01
 Now if you wanted that, you can't do titanium.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 Suggested functions for the buttons scrolling function could be very beneficial to us.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_01
 Instead of actual buttons themselves, I think I have one more slide.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_01
 No, I don't.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_01
 The manufacturing division also has said that they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip, which we could utilize.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 Push button requires a simple ship and scroll requires more complicated chip.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_01
 So depends on what we decide we want to do.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_01
 In addition to that, if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote, we're going to have to have multiples of each type.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_01
 Like a double curved in rubber.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_01
 Each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll have to mix it up, make sure we produce enough of everyone.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_01
 But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced 5,000 double curved wooden remotes.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_02
 Oh my god.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you for those informative presentations.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_02
 Let's go back to now we have to make some decisions.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_00
 Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say for sure.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_00
 That's just that this new technology that I've developed on the voice recognition.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, this is the thing we're talking about earlier.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_00
 Except it's sort of odd and not exactly sure why they're explaining it in the way they are.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_00
 There's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_00
 So you would say like good morning coffee maker and it would just blend.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_00
 Good morning Joe.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_00
 But I'm not sure exactly how it's going to work.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_00
 Because do you program the Wii program, the responses and the questions?

0:14:33	SPEAKER_00
 Does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question and can't change it?

0:14:37	SPEAKER_00
 In order for it to be recognized, can it be altered in a certain way or just the actual user program it?

0:14:42	SPEAKER_00
 Like channel means this.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, like using the menu to be like inner your name into the screen, like on the menu option to that way.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_00
 So it's got like a limited memory and so you program it.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_00
 So it's sort of iffy.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_00
 That's kind of what you say.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_03
 I feel like voice recognition would be, I don't know, it would be too hard to really probably.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_02
 I mean we could do it, but if it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would, you know, take that.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we are making the chip.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_01
 So I mean, but I guess we have to look at what our production cost is for the chip itself.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_03
 And it is a growing trend, the higher technological, like the, I mean just like the more advanced it is.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, better it'll sell.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_01
 I thought offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different, you know.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_01
 I think we'd have to decide on the power options maybe.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that we could reduce cost.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, how heavy.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, that kind of brings us to this.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_02
 Let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_02
 Do we want to go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier?

0:16:07	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, the base, yeah.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_02
 The base, the charging base.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what it looks like before.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, there's something really, really small.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_00
 Then it's sort of harder to imagine the base where that was quite a substantial size sort of standing up.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and we don't have multiple things that it has to control, just has to control the TV.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_02
 It's not going to be a huge universal amount.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_03
 We need to decide, well, so we can figure out how big it's going to be, like what exactly what buttons we want.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_00
 The other thing is like even if it's got a few buttons, we want to figure this.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_00
 It could be like bigger than this.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it still fits in your hands, you still want it something that's comfortable and substantial, but not necessarily full of buttons.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_03
 This one is really comfortable.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_03
 Like, I like the sides.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_03
 Whatever.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_03
 It'll lose it easier.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_03
 But if we have the locator, then we don't have to worry about that.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_03
 That's true.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_03
 So we can make it small if we have a locating device.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_01
 We do a voice activated locator, though.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to be looking at a more substantial chip.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_00
 So that's the other thing.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_00
 Are we going to have certain chips that are going to require bigger size in the period?

0:17:16	SPEAKER_03
 Two double A's.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_03
 For the size.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_00
 But if we get more complicated, then it's going to have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_01
 Honestly, I think the customer would be irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did do a nice small compact.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_02
 It's either going to be bigger with a base or smaller with a battery like this guy.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_02
 So what direction do you want to go in?

0:17:46	SPEAKER_03
 I think if we had a locating device with a small one, I think that seems way more advanced.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_02
 I'm kind of leaning in the direction.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_02
 A base.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_02
 It's a bigger and a base.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_03
 That just seems clunky.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because, I mean, even looking at cell phones right now, those trends, the smaller the hotter it is.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_01
 The only problem with that is you forget to take a dirty repocket and go in the wash.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, kidding.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_01
 You know, it happens.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I had three watches go that way too.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_00
 I've never watched the phone roll.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_03
 That would, wow.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_03
 That would hurt.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_02
 So what kind of material do we want?

0:18:24	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we have lots of options.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think wood is a viable option.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_02
 Well, what did you say?

0:18:30	SPEAKER_00
 Go ahead.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_00
 I was just saying that Titanic, if we're being restricted then.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_00
 I hope it's going to lead away from that.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because it's going to cause this mortar producer chip.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_03
 Titanium would be more expensive.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_03
 However, what would you recommend?

0:18:43	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, we only want to sell it for 25 euro, right?

0:18:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_01
 Because I was thinking if we wanted to get the high end market, then you could produce a few in titanium.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_01
 Make them rarerity sort of.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_03
 We could do that because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, we have restricted by this.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_04
 Well, the original.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_02
 Remotes.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_02
 If this was a successful remote, we might then produce a higher end version of it.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_02
 I think.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_02
 Good plan.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_02
 Good plan.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so we want to go for plastic or what would you recommend for materials?

0:19:25	SPEAKER_01
 Honestly, I'd recommend like, since we're going with batteries instead of solar power, I'd recommend maybe a soft latex because we could produce, you know how cell phones have those overlays that you can change the color.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_01
 We could do one that fits in with the trends of the year.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_01
 So because this year is all fruit, got to get us why?

0:19:49	SPEAKER_01
 Who knows.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_01
 We could do a cherry cover for this year and then if next year is stripes or solids, you know.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_00
 So you're talking about like when it leaves our sales room, then it's all going to be cherry colored or is it going to be the kind of thing where people come back?

0:20:05	SPEAKER_02
 Or we could like take it back in the back cases and buy the extra case if they wanted.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's good to sell basic thing and then sell.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_01
 So we could do like a hard base plastic and then we could give the two latex covers.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay, to start.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because the soft latex definitely is squishy.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I mean squishier than like, right, yeah, just a hard plastic.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, and what kind of chip would we need for this guy?

0:20:36	SPEAKER_01
 How complicated are we going to go with the voice activated?

0:20:39	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think we should do voice.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should just do the recognition for when it's lost.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_02
 You know, could we talk?

0:20:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because I don't know what type of voice activation would be like a certain term, what would we say?

0:20:54	SPEAKER_03
 Because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_03
 Right, so.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we could give it a specific code, you know, remote missing.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_03
 I see, I'm straightingly track due because I know that's definitely going to be big because it's, I don't know, just so high-tech.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_00
 My little sister got, for Christmas, she got one of those keyfinders that's like a key ring.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_00
 And you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, see that would just be your laugh.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_00
 And it would start going off and her person, you couldn't turn it off.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, it's okay.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, it's okay.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_00
 And it came highly irritating.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, maybe voice activated.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_01
 So I think having a key phrase is much better.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_02
 All right, but it's not going to be voice activated in the fact that you would say channel up and it would work.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_02
 Right?

0:21:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, no, no, no.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have to be affluent.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_03
 But can your, can the department make that would be like a mid class?

0:21:48	SPEAKER_01
 Um, yeah, so we don't actually have to go for.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if they've just developed a sample sensor, sample speaker.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_01
 It's a brand new chip.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_01
 Why not introduce it in this way?

0:22:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_02
 And what size batteries?

0:22:07	SPEAKER_02
 AA, AAA.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_02
 I think AAA.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_03
 It'll be lighter too.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_00
 Can you run off of two more than a package?

0:22:14	SPEAKER_01
 I think, well, we could do two.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_01
 We could do one small lithium.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_01
 Because you know, the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products, right?

0:22:27	SPEAKER_01
 So they're more widely available now.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_01
 And they also have a longer battery life than most batteries.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_02
 They're more expensive than that, too.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_01
 But I feel like I have to replace it every five years.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_00
 Does it get thoughts?

0:22:41	SPEAKER_00
 As long as we sell it with it.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_01
 Well, how about an initial?

0:22:45	SPEAKER_01
 You get one battery when you buy it.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_01
 Isn't pretty sure we can get them.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_03
 We could think about it.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_02
 We'll come back to it next week.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_02
 So we've covered that first category.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_02
 User interface concept, meaning design.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, what's it going to look like?

0:23:10	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_02
 I kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_02
 And that the central button could have maybe our logo on it.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_02
 It might be the four-way scroll, too.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it could be whatever.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_03
 As long as there's something big in the middle because like the old phones.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_03
 There's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_00
 And the two of that is if it got too big though.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_00
 So if you have the circle and the button in the middle, then is it going to get wider than your hands or?

0:23:40	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, that's true.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_00
 And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it?

0:23:44	SPEAKER_00
 It could be a complaint.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_01
 In the sample ones that you showed us, there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_01
 Which I think if we make it curved like a hand shape.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_01
 Like if we put the scroll button on the side.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I see.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_01
 That could be particularly useful.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_03
 So scroll buttons on the side and the buttons on the top.

0:24:07	None
 But we definitely, if we have scroll thing on the side, we definitely have to have them labeled.

0:24:13	None
 Yeah.

0:24:14	None
 Like on the side.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_03
 It's just up and down.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_03
 But is that for volume or channel?

0:24:18	SPEAKER_03
 Which I don't know.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you could do.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_03
 We have more stuff.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_01
 We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_01
 Otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_00
 Instead of a scroll, you just have buttons on the side, which are on the side.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_02
 Any other ideas?

0:25:03	SPEAKER_02
 What color?

0:25:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_02
 Latex covers.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_01
 We have to make sure that the logo always sticks out when we put the latex cover on.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll have to like have a little square or something.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_00
 A logo is available.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_00
 A yellow strip at the bottom with the RR like that.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_02
 So the bottom of it.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_02
 I think maybe we should do it on a button itself though, because people are able to change the covers.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe the on-off button, something.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_02
 Some, the menu button.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_02
 But you know, if we're going to put our company logo on there, and somebody could just get another one, are they all going to have our company logo on them?

0:25:44	SPEAKER_02
 Every cover?

0:25:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think we should do that because that would just be icky.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_01
 So I think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_02
 If we want it to be visible.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_02
 Are all of those ones that you showed where they were silver metallic looking?

0:26:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_02
 But those are plastic, right?

0:26:04	SPEAKER_02
 You're not titanium.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_02
 I kind of like that look.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_02
 For our base one?

0:26:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_02
 For the base.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_02
 Or if we're going for the retro look, I think like a really shiny black would be cool.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_02
 Or like a good gunmetal gray.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_03
 Because that gray could bind to the silver and the black.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_02
 There you go.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_02
 That'll gray.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just really wary of putting anything on a button.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_00
 Why?

0:26:37	SPEAKER_02
 It'll wear off.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, buttons will.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_00
 Well, then what's the button do and how do you know what the button does?

0:26:44	None
 Yes.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_00
 Just looking at your examples.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_00
 You just don't ever see the logo on a button.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_00
 It's always on the actual casing.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_01
 There's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_01
 We want to be visible.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_03
 We want to be visible.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_02
 Because if it was only on the back really the only time you're going to see it is.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_02
 When you drop it or when you're changing the battery.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_00
 The other option is.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_00
 If you can see it, it's like if I can find it again.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_00
 It's like the second or last slide.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_02
 And yours was called.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_02
 Interfaces.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_02
 This one.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_02
 There's some reason I can't get it to just go to that slide directly.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, it's the very right one.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_00
 You see at the bottom it's kind of difficult to see.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_00
 But you have like a sort of division between the bottom like where the logo is.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_00
 And if we have the replaceable section, it's like the top.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't necessarily replace the entire top.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_00
 So you have that one piece of stays and the rest sort of clips in.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_00
 You're envisioning it.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_00
 So that stays the same when you have the logo.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_00
 And then you have to slip that client clips in and that's a bit of changes.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_01
 The only problem is we're using a latex overlay.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_01
 So that actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_01
 So I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be like a little cut out.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_00
 You know, really like a cell phone.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_00
 It's like the screen.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_00
 It's always just left open.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_00
 And so what are we going to do it like right yellow with our.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_02
 Anybody see anything that they liked in.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_03
 Well, some of those buttons that are blue based.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_03
 Well, a lot of those buttons are blue based.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_03
 Well, kind of.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_03
 And then if we do have them illuminate upon contact, they can illuminate yellow yellow.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_03
 I like that.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_03
 Like if we like the one all the way on the left, you can see it on your computer better.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_03
 Where the button is actually blue, but the number itself is clear or white or whatever.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_03
 So if you pressed it, it would illuminate yellow.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_03
 Sweet, blue and yellow for the touch.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, and so.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_02
 I like the yellow illumination idea.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_02
 Very good.

0:29:09	None
 Okay.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_02
 Any other ideas or thoughts?

0:29:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, some be fairly in agreement about what we want to do with this project.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_00
 So let me catch up.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_00
 Do we finalize what buttons were including?

0:29:36	SPEAKER_00
 It was just everything that we said before.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_02
 I think there will be time for that later.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_02
 I'm guessing.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, well, we're going to wrap this up.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_02
 Next meeting is going to start in 30 minutes.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_02
 And here's what we're each of us going to do.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_02
 The ID is going to do the look and field design.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_02
 The UID, the user interface design.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_02
 I think you're going to get a lot of, I mean, the final say on what buttons get put.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_02
 We'll all talk about it, but I think that's pretty much what you're going to do, right?

0:30:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_02
 And you're going to do some product evaluation.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_02
 And right now, the ID and UID, you two are going to work together on a prototype using modeling clay.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_01
 Great.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_02
 Played it.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_02
 And you shall be getting an email pretty soon.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you for a very productive meeting.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you.
