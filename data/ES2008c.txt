0:00:44	None
 Okay.

0:00:45	None
 Thank you.

0:00:46	None
 Yeah.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:00:49	None
 Thank you.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry.

0:00:52	None
 Okay.

0:00:53	None
 Okay.

0:00:54	None
 Okay.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_01
 Lovely to see you all again.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_01
 So our conceptual design meeting.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_01
 And it's starting at approximately 1425.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_01
 And so we have 40 minutes for this one again.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll go just after three o'clock.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_01
 Our agenda, we're going to do an opening.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to review the minutes of the last meeting.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_01
 Then we'll have your three presentations.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_01
 And then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_01
 Finally, we'll close.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_01
 So opening.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_01
 These are our minutes from the functional design.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_01
 We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_01
 Because we have international appeal.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_01
 And we have a lot of different functions for all age groups, different functions of it.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_01
 Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_01
 And in specific functions, we're something to keep the remote from getting lost, large buttons for the essential functions, a possibility for extra functions like a sliding piece, and a long-life battery or a charging station.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_01
 I'd like to do it in this order first to do the conceptual specification of components, properties, and materials.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_01
 And then the conceptual specification of user interface.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_01
 And finally, trend watching.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:02:26	None
 Wow.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_01
 Function, I've made it.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_01
 There we go.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_03
 I'm very excited by this one actually, guys.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_03
 I had a lot of fun doing it.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_03
 Components design.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_03
 This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of?

0:03:04	SPEAKER_03
 So we need to examine each element separately, but we're designing a full thing.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_03
 So you want to keep it integrated as a whole.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_03
 The main elements of remote controls in general, and therefore ours as well, are the case, the buttons, the circuit board with the chip, and the battery.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_03
 These are all things that we had sort of addressed before, but we're going to take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_03
 The case, the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do, there's a shape of a case.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_03
 We could do a flat case, a curved case, or maybe even a double, double curved case.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_03
 I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_03
 Just keep that in mind, but these are the options that we have for manufacturing.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_03
 And we can make our case out of plastic.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_03
 The main base will be plastic, but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in, wood, latex, titanium, rubber, or other colored types of plastic.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_03
 That would be our case.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_03
 For buttons we have push buttons, which is what real reaction uses the most often, but we also have scroll wheels, which can have integrated push buttons, or we could go all high tech and have an LCD screen.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_03
 Circuit board and chip, we can have a simple one, regular one, or an advanced one, depending on what our other needs are.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_03
 And then battery, I think, is where things get most exciting.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_03
 We're talking about long-life batteries here.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_03
 We can have your sort of basic AA batteries, but we also have these options of using a kinetic battery, like our used in high tech watches, where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_03
 So simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery, or solar battery, although there are slight complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_03
 Or something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about 50 years ago flashlights.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_03
 Not quite sure what that is, but that's the description that I received, so that's what I'm passing on to you.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_03
 So those are our options.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_03
 Personal preferences that I was thinking through.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_03
 Here's what we've been talking about all through, fashion and simplicity.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_03
 So if we're going for fashion in our cases, I think that what we're going to want to look at is a curved or a double curved case, probably with a variety of design elements, maybe titanium, maybe some wood, we're going to have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials, that's sort of what I have in mind, and we want to go for simplicity.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_03
 Probably push buttons, but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll, if anyone has anything, any ideas on that.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll buttons, which are exactly like what they're describing, so that might be something we want to look into.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_03
 And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_03
 A solar, I don't think, would be such a good idea because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light?

0:06:15	SPEAKER_03
 But this idea of the kinetic that you don't have to replace and that a simple just shaking around will make it work.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_03
 I think that that would be a very interesting thing.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_03
 But I think we'd also want to go for a simple chip or a regular chip to keep our costs down.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_03
 We really only need a regular or advanced chip if we're going to start using an LCD.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly technological if they don't need to be because that'll keep our manufacturing price away down.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_03
 That's what I have for options.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_03
 I'd appreciate anyone's input, but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the look of this thing.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_02
 It's double curved, like, would that be like two hands kind of thing?

0:06:58	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure. I haven't received any specific visual information.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_02
 It's not as if like double curved is like, you know, like two sides of the curve.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_02
 This is what I'm sort of...

0:07:08	SPEAKER_02
 This is what I'm sort of...

0:07:09	SPEAKER_02
 One curve would just be like a single vertical.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_02
 It's kind of what you think.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure, but I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_03
 I wonder.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_03
 I know if we do have a double curved case, it can't have any titanium in it.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_03
 But the titanium, they were quite...

0:07:25	SPEAKER_03
 They were marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space program.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_03
 So that could be quite interesting.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_03
 Space age, from the...

0:07:33	SPEAKER_03
 Just all things you've been learning.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_01
 Just an interesting marketing kind of element.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_03
 That's been all I have to do, guys.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_03
 I hope I didn't go through that too quickly.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_01
 Just a real quick question.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_01
 The weight of these different elements.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_01
 Have you...

0:07:49	SPEAKER_01
 No idea.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_03
 I have no idea.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_03
 I'm assuming that...

0:07:56	SPEAKER_03
 The kinetic battery isn't going to take up that much weight.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_03
 And the titanium is very light, I know.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_03
 But if it's Susan's face...

0:08:04	SPEAKER_03
 That's really basic.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, that's all I have gotten so far.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_03
 Any other questions?

0:08:12	None
 Nope.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_03
 I have saved this in the shared projects if anyone wants to look.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you, Perf.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_03
 And it has considerable notes on the topic as well if anyone needs any more information.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_01
 If you made notes yourself, you can put those on our...

0:08:31	SPEAKER_01
 Underneath our...

0:08:32	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_01
...in your book, the No-Write.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_03
 But if anyone has any specific questions, don't hesitate to email me or something.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_03
 I guess, okay.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, now we're concepts of user interface.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, this one's so much tighter than the other one.

0:08:55	None
 I know.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 Nope.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_01
 There we go.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_01
 There we go.

0:09:04	None
 I'm sorry.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to describe the concept of user interface list as a device.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_00
 We've talked about the two essential properties of the user interface.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_00
 We wanted to be simple and we wanted to be fashionable.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_00
 However, we've also got to remember that this is a device that's as useful as we want people to be able to use it as a remote control.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_00
 So we need to determine what the essential functions of the device are and make sure that we include...

0:10:20	SPEAKER_00
...but we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_00
 We have a number of different choices for a design concept.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_00
 And that's something that RShays examples of.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_00
 But essentially we need to choose how is this device going to work?

0:10:43	SPEAKER_00
 How...

0:10:45	SPEAKER_00
 What kind of model is that going to be the use of interaction with this device?

0:10:50	SPEAKER_00
 Once we've chosen a concept for it, we can then design the features around the concepts, making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_00
 And of course we also have to make it look cool.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_00
 So basically that's what we don't want.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_00
 We don't want lots of buttons complicated features.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_00
 We want something that looks nice and simple.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_00
 Here's a fairly simple device.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_00
 This is an iPod from Apple.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_00
 I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_00
 It's very minimalistic in its design.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_00
 It uses four buttons to move around a range of settings on a small LCD screen.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_00
 The thing I like about this is that it's very quick to access the main features.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_00
 You can just about make up that the bottom three buttons are free of extract, next track and playpores.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_00
 The main features of the iPod, the things you will use all the time.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_00
 Then if you want to do anything more advanced, you go into a little menu on the LCD screen.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_00
 And you use the buttons just to scroll around and find the more advanced features that you want.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_00
 So I think that's a good kind of model that we could have.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_00
 Here's another example.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_00
 It's an interesting idea. It looks pretty cool.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_00
 It's a novelty value. It's nice and colorful. It's nice and bright.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_00
 It's also something that you can feel your way around.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_00
 The buttons are in different shapes.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_00
 If you're watching TV in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_00
 Basically, it's fun.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_00
 I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_00
 You need a few buttons to select your favorite channels.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_00
 I mean most people when they watch TV, they have 250 channels on their TV and they watch it for them at the most.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_00
 So you have buttons for your favorite channel, changing the volume which is something you do all the time when you're watching TV.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_00
 And the buttons to switch off in case you get bored.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_00
 Other features, things like adjusting the brightness, tuning the TV.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_00
 What else you do with a TV.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_00
 These are all necessary functions.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_00
 You don't have to have a TV that you can't tune or you can't set the contrast.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_00
 We need to find a way of including these somehow.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_00
 One of the suggestions I'd make is to include them in a menu system a bit like on the iPod.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_00
 We either have a small LCD display on the device itself or have a menu display that comes up on your television and can be controlled through the device.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_00
 So I would allow you to access the advanced features whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so you'd be advocating an LCD then?

0:14:20	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's one way to go.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_00
 The advantages and disadvantages of you, if you have an LCD display, it's nice because it lets you sit there and control your television from your armchair.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_00
 There are disadvantages and an LCD display would have to be quite small because I assume we're going to be making quite a small device.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_00
 It would also have to have a kind of backlighting in it because you tend to watch TV in the dark, right?

0:14:54	SPEAKER_00
 You need to be able to see your LCD display.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_00
 Your alternative is to have a non-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_00
 A bit like how they have these digital boxes where you press buttons and it comes up with your listening or watch on each channel.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_00
 That's also a good idea. It does have these problems as well if you've got a small TV and you're sitting on the other side of a room, it's hard to read the notes.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_00
 It comes up.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_00
 But that's a design decision that we can make.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_01
 I do think that one of the important features for remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_01
 So favorite channels is applicable but I think that you do need to have some kind of function where you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_01
 I know I use that.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_02
 Is that separate from what he was saying?

0:15:51	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if it was an LCD on the remote, I don't know that you would be able to see it.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_03
 I think we're talking menu contrast and tuning the VCR or something if I've understood you, rather than menu as what's on.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_00
 Because that would be more specifically digital boxes.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_00
 If we put a display on the remote control, communication is one way.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_00
 So you can't have the television send information back to the remote control.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_01
 Now what's going on to market?

0:16:33	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it's just not.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_03
 What's the price?

0:17:33	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I don't know how relevant all of this is going to be.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_02
 There we go.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_02
 Basically, I was given an executive summary that was a market investigation on road controls that was recently conducted.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_02
 So first, they have people, they ranked the important aspects of remote controls.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_02
 So that's going to be switching to fancy looking fuel remote.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_02
 So we're talking about simplicity and easy to use idea.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_02
 And then we're talking about the technology innovation that would be like if we use something like the space material or LCD screen, things like that.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_02
 And then each of you was the third most important.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_02
 Fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes, shoes, and furniture is for to be fashionable.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_02
 And that there's a preference for spongy type material.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_02
 And so that brings us to my personal preferences.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_02
 Who wants this fun cheer vote or one of the potential that personally, I don't really think that I want one that's going to go out the style or go stay out excuse the pun in a year.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_02
 So even though this is coming from us as, you know, trend watch market research, I don't know how much of a renecissarily want to take away.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_02
 And if necessarily this whole fashion technology to eat it easy to use is necessarily the right ranking personally, like I might reverse it.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_02
 But if we're working for this company, then I guess no matter what we have to stress fashion the most, but it doesn't necessarily need to be a spongy material.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_02
 So there's all kinds of scope for imagination that would though.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_01
 I don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them that pretty much sums it up.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_02
 So yeah.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_01
 Do you have any ideas how to possibly use these? How to use a fruit of vegetable or or the spongy material at all?

0:21:19	SPEAKER_01
 Like, could we make a like, could we make a spongy remote it would be easier on the hand.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_03
 If it's latexy, it's kind of.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_01
 Then it would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_03
 My understanding of latex cases that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside, but it's covered with the latex, which is spongy or softer on your hands.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_03
 There's something to be said.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, we got that thing earlier from you about not wanting it to our repetitive stress injuries, things and.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_03
 So something.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_02
 Is that a gripable?

0:21:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, grip.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_02
 More than like sinking into your hands.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_02
 I think I'm envisioning more like, you know, the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle so that it doesn't hurt.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_02
 You're sitting on for a long time like, I'm imagining that sort of thing.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what that is.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's good.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_03
 Given the list of materials, I was forwarded it.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_03
 That seems doable.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_03
 Could we go in fruit and vegetable colors?

0:22:21	SPEAKER_03
 You could color color.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_01
 Or maybe like a couple main ones being like, I don't know, lemons or strawberries.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_01
 Could they be smelly?

0:22:32	SPEAKER_00
 Is it supposed to be shake like a vegetable?

0:22:37	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_00
 Like a cow that's also eaten.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, it's quite easy to shake.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_03
 Or maybe the buttons could be shake.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_03
 Like large button.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_01
 That's what I was thinking.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_02
 What about the idea like a round remote instead of like a vertical up and down one?

0:22:52	SPEAKER_02
 Like in terms of holding it.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_02
 That's a sheath of a fruit.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_01
 Might have tied it in a little.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_01
 You'd be able to hold it because I think the reason they're long.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_03
 The harder it is.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_03
 But yeah.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_03
 I think.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_03
 Be harder to press.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_00
 I'm ready to push.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_00
 When you use a remote, you press the buttons with your thumb usually.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_01
 I usually hold it one hand, maybe.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_00
 I want something that's shaped like a mobile phone.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_00
 So you hold it in one hand.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_00
 And you press the buttons.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_03
 But then the buttons will have to be very small.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_03
 I tend to do it.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_01
 But do you think they're just thumb-sides?

0:23:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_01
 But I mean, in order to get to all of them, you know, they would have to be within a certain amount of space.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_00
 But if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway, then it's not so much.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_03
 When I'm pressing buttons on my iPod, that's how I do it.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_03
 Hold it and press.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_00
 So you hold it in one hand.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_00
 And you press the buttons.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_03
 And use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_03
 I love the idea.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_02
 We all like five times.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_00
 Is it the button on the iPod?

0:23:57	SPEAKER_00
 What is it?

0:23:58	SPEAKER_00
 Is it just four buttons or is it four?

0:24:00	SPEAKER_02
 It's like five.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_02
 Because there's one that's metal.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, each version of it has been a little bit different.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_01
 The one I have doesn't have the four on it.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_03
 And one of the in between ones when they weren't doing that anymore.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_03
 And you press the center button.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_03
 That's your all-purpose select button right there.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, OK.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_03
 This is the one in the center that's not marked.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_02
 I think why would it be good for us is because like you could have the same wheel sort of a different kind of thing for like channel flipping.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_02
 And then the other one could be like for volume.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_02
 Like just the idea of like those so few buttons for main things.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_02
 But then how you go back to the menu.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_02
 And like, I don't know if we would want to not on the screen there on the actual TV.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_02
 I kind of am wanting to say on the TV because if you're changing the brightness, don't you want to see it happening kind of?

0:25:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_02
 And I think it's still how that real world is.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_03
 And I think it's how that real world is.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_00
 But it's not the real world, but at the moment with content.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_00
 They are not still PlayStation.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_00
 Not only that, though, because it's a good set of things.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_01
 I'm really not having it completely Netz emailed.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_01
 Well, let me show you what we are doing.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_01
 You're having a very greatーン, when we have like the DB-m not been served.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_01
 Just before that invitation to screen how powerfuloodle, Is your reflection element.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_01
 I just want to have to keep an eye out on that is.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_01
 to make decisions about these kinds of things. So I'll just bring that up and show you all.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_02
 I think I need more information on fruits and vegetables.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_03
 Can we let you know? Can we have changeable covers like for your mobile?

0:25:48	SPEAKER_03
 In different fruit and vegetable colors. Yeah. Yeah and then like the covers could be spongy latex. But the actual model could be tiny. And you could cord day with your house.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_00
 The packaging is like a lemon and the packaging is like peel.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_01
 Like the way it all comes off.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_03
 Energy.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_03
 Oh yes. Right. I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get be necessary. But this is the agenda they gave me. So what can you just explain with that as real quick? Decisions. What the...

0:26:47	SPEAKER_03
 Okay this isn't on energy I'm thinking is based on the battery.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what do people think about this kinetic battery idea?

0:26:57	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's awesome. I think it's really cool. Yeah. I mean it would totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. I think it's good as long as we consider the cost and how reliable it is.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_03
 Right. I haven't gotten any cost. Yeah. Any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery. But over time.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_03
 But if we're using a cheaper chip than it will even out I think circuit boards.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_03
 They're they're a thin fiberglass with copper wires etched onto them.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_03
 And I think they're quite easily printed on by machine which chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and soldiers it all together for us.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_03
 I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions. I wasn't really given any options.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_03
 I was just given that this is how they're done. Okay.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah I can't really tell you. I can tell you a whole lot about how it works.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_03
 But I don't know any decisions on...

0:28:04	SPEAKER_01
 If they're if they're really options. Yeah. I'm sorry. Okay.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_00
 A whole circuit board is pretty much the same. Yeah. Okay then we'll move on to the case.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_01
 I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple a regular or an advanced chip maybe.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_03
 Well okay. Here's the here's the thing on the chips that I got.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_03
 Simple regular advanced chip on print. The chip on print includes an infinite sensor so we don't have to worry about that. Okay. The push button if we're going to have push buttons they require a simple chip but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip and an LCD requires advanced.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_03
 Do we want a scroll wheel or do we just want push buttons?

0:28:56	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think we need a scroll wheel. I mean it might be nice if it changes in the volume.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_01
 It would be nice for changing the volume but I don't know how useful it would be for changing the channel

0:29:05	SPEAKER_03
 because you don't have control over numbers or... Yeah it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices. But if you could scroll through the channels

0:29:20	SPEAKER_02
 and then the volume would just be... Wait five minutes left for the meeting. And the volume would just be like the same way. Yeah. Forward and backward it is. I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking. Yeah. And otherwise no matter how many buttons we have we're going to have like you know black with red sticking out and it's going to inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones have you set up stacked up. So have a scroll for volume

0:29:50	SPEAKER_03
 or for all those secret functions. When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons you could have a scroll wheels to go through those menus.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_00
 I think yeah I think a scroll wheel would be nice but it's not necessary. Right. So we could either go

0:30:08	SPEAKER_03
 with a simple or a regular chip depending on maybe we could table out this in for later.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_01
 I think well I think when we go into the user face we're going to have to decide the interface we're going to have to decide whether we're going to have a scroll or not. Well let's think about that while we talk about the case.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay let's do case. I'm kind of liking the idea of latex if spongy is the end thing.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_01
 I'm a little hesitant about it because I'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. What could it be hard and then yeah everything I would be more okay with like a titanium

0:30:45	SPEAKER_03
 actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing. What I've seen just not related to this but of latex cases before is that there's a lot like a hard plastic inside and it's just covered with the latex. Okay. Not too thick a layer of latex just enough to be gripable.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_03
 I like by candles or anything that you've seen like that the inside is hard. I don't think we need to worry about protecting this or import I think that's done for us. Okay. So we do want latex.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. Okay latex and probably in colors maybe fruity vegetable colors. Yeah.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_01
 Fruity colors. Okay. Let's go to the user interface then we'll come back to the chip I suppose.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_03
 Oh and we want a curved case yeah or a double curved. Well we don't really know what the

0:31:41	SPEAKER_02
 difference is right. The thing in curved is some sort. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We don't really know

0:31:46	SPEAKER_01
 what the difference. Okay. Interface the type and the supplements. So push or scroll right

0:31:58	SPEAKER_00
 or both. And I think if we want to keep our costs we should just go for push buttons because then we can have a simple chip and it's simpler. It's cheaper to make push buttons and it is a scroll button. Good point. Sometimes it's probably better to make push buttons.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_01
 And if we had a screen kind of thing that you could scroll through like you could use your buttons to scroll through things. Yes. I think that for channel surfing I think a scroll that actually like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast. Yeah. I don't know.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_03
 I say push buttons at least unless we get any information that I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than a push button but it's got to be some more expensive so I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery in the

0:32:55	SPEAKER_02
 cool case. Is that okay with you? Yeah. I'm let's like see if we get anything else. I mean I'm not like hard sold on the scroll wheel. It's more just to give it a different kind of look but if it's going to be an elite text type thing and that's going to look cool then that's probably going to

0:33:10	SPEAKER_01
 have a bigger impact on the scroll wheel. Yeah. Okay so we're going to go with type push buttons and then supplements. How are we going to do that? What do you mean by supplements?

0:33:24	SPEAKER_01
 I assume that's what else we're going to like the additional buttons we can use.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_01
 So we're going to have like a menu button so that we can access on screen things.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_01
 Then okay so we're doing an on screen menu that we can scroll through.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_03
 So what are buttons going to be on off?

0:33:43	SPEAKER_00
 On off volume type channels. So like one through five or like a radio type sort of as the duration. Yeah like yeah a bit like radio presets.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_01
 Preset channels and then we're going to need numbers one through zero.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_00
 We wouldn't even need numbers. I think maybe numbers since it's kind of like a

0:34:07	SPEAKER_01
 preset. Oh you guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling to.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_00
 We need some kind of. Yeah okay finishing the meeting now. Our next meeting starts in 30 minutes.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_01
 You each have things to do look and field design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modeling clay.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_01
 Okay okay. Did we decide on a chip? Let's go with a simple chip.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_01
 Simple chip. Okay we are done. Thank you everyone.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_01
 I think these are already in our shared folder. Okay cool.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_03
 It's working out.
