0:00:30	None
 I'm sorry, so...

0:00:32	None
 I just didn't have to leave the end of the video.

0:00:35	None
 Oh, I'm gonna leave it.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:00:39	None
 You might be leaving the end of the back.

0:00:41	None
 I'm just gonna leave it.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_03
 I'm sorry.

0:00:45	None
 So...

0:00:47	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_01
 I think I...

0:00:53	None
 Yeah.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sorry.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_02
 14, 26.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_01
 Lovely to see you all again.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_01
 It's our conceptual design meeting.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_01
 And it's starting at approximately 14, 25, and so we have 40 minutes for this one again.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll go just after 3 o'clock.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_01
 All right, Genda, we're gonna do an opening.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_01
 I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_01
 Then we'll have your three presentations.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_01
 And then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_01
 Finally, we'll close.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_01
 So... opening.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_01
 These are our minutes from the functional design.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_01
 We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it, because we have international appeal, and we said it's for all age groups, different functions of it.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_01
 Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_01
 And in specific functions were something to keep the remote from getting lost.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_01
 Large buttons for the essential functions.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_01
 A possibility for extra functions like a sliding piece.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_01
 And a long-life battery or a charging station.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_01
 Now three presentations.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_01
 I'd like to do it in this order.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_01
 First, do the conceptual specification of components, properties, and materials.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_01
 That would be me.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_01
 And then the conceptual specification of user interface.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_01
 And finally, trend watching.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_03
 Alright.

0:02:24	None
 Well...

0:02:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_01
 Function of edit.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_01
 There we go.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_03
 Alright.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_03
 I'm very excited by this one, actually, guys.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_03
 I had a lot of fun doing it.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_03
 Components design.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_03
 This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control, and what should we make our specific remote control out of?

0:03:08	SPEAKER_03
 So we need to examine each element separately, but we're designing a full thing, so you want to keep it integrated as a whole.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_03
 The main elements of remote controls, in general, and therefore ours as well, are the case, the buttons, the circuit board with the chip, and the battery.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_03
 These are all things that we had sort of addressed before, but we're going to take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_03
 The case, the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do, there's a shape of a case.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_03
 We could do a flat case, a curved case, or maybe even a double, double-curved case.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_03
 I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_03
 Just keep that in mind, but these are the options that we have for manufacturing.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_03
 And we can make our case out of plastic.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_03
 The main base will be plastic, but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in, wood, latex, titanium, rubber, or other colored types of plastic.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_03
 That would be our case.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_03
 For buttons, we have push buttons, which is what real reaction uses the most often, but we also have scroll wheels, which can have integrated push buttons, or we could go all high-tech and have an LCD screen.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_03
 Circuit board and chip, we can have a simple one, a regular one, or an advanced one, depending on what our other needs are.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_03
 And then battery, I think, is where things get most exciting.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_03
 We're talking about long-life batteries here.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_03
 We can have your basic AA batteries, but we also have these options of using a kinetic battery, like are used in high-tech watches, where you just have to move it a little bit to power up.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_03
 So simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery, or solar battery, although there are slight complications with solar batteries, as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_03
 Or something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about 50 years ago, flashlights.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_03
 Not quite sure what that is, but that's the description that I received, so that's what I'm passing on to you.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_03
 So those are our options.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_03
 And personal preferences that I was thinking through.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_03
 Here's what we've been talking about all through fashion and simplicity.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_03
 So if we're going for fashion in our cases, I think that what we're going to want to look at is a curved or a double-curved case, probably with a variety of design elements, maybe titanium, maybe some wood.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_03
 We're going to have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_03
 That's sort of what I have in mind.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_03
 And we want to go for simplicity.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_03
 Probably push buttons, but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll wheel if anyone has anything.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_03
 Any ideas on that? I mean, I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll buttons, which are exactly like what they're describing, so that might be something we want to look into.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_03
 And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_03
 A solar, I don't think, would be such a good idea because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light?

0:06:17	SPEAKER_03
 But this idea of the kinetic that you don't have to replace and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_03
 That would be a very interesting thing.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_03
 But I think we'd also want to go for a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_03
 We really only need a regular or advanced chip if we're going to start using an LCD.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly technological if they don't need to be because that'll keep our manufacturing price way down.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_03
 That's what I have for options. I'd appreciate anyone's input, but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the look of this thing.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_02
 It's double curved, would that be like two hands kind of thing?

0:07:01	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure I haven't received any specific visuals.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_02
 Imagine like double curved is like, you know, like two sides, the curve and then one curve would just be like a single vertical.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I'm not sure, but I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_03
 I wonder.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_03
 I know if we do have a double curved case, it can't have any titanium in it.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_03
 But the titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space program.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_03
 So that could be quite interesting. Space age.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_03
 Just an interesting marketing kind of element.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_03
 That's been all I have to do guys.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_03
 I hope I didn't go through that too quickly.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_01
 Just a real quick question.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_01
 The weight of these different elements.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_01
 Have you? No idea.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_03
 I've no idea.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_03
 I'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't going to take up that much weight.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_03
 And that titanium is very light.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_01
 I know.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_03
 But of the seasons, that's really basic.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, that's all I have gotten so far.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_03
 Any other questions?

0:08:13	SPEAKER_03
 No? Okay.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_03
 I'm kind of saving this in the shared projects.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_03
 If anyone wants to look, thank you.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_03
 And I have considerable notes on the topic as well.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_03
 If anyone needs any more information.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_01
 If you made notes yourself, you can put those on our underneath our book.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, you're booked.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_03
 But if anyone has any specific questions, don't hesitate to email me or something.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_03
 I guess I can.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_01
 Now we're concepts, concepts of user interface.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_01
 This one's so much tighter than the other.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_01
 Nope.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 There we go.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_01
 There you are.

0:09:05	None
 Let's see.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, no, Jason.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, Jason.

0:09:23	None
 Okay.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm going to describe the concept of user interface.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_00
 This device.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_00
 We've talked about the two essential properties of the user interface.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_00
 We want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_00
 We've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as useful purpose.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_00
 We want people to be able to use it as a remote control.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_00
 So we need to determine what the essential functions of the device are and make sure that we include all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_00
 We have a number of different choices for a design concept.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_00
 And that's something that I'll show you some examples of.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_00
 But essentially we need to choose how is this device going to work?

0:10:44	SPEAKER_00
 How what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device?

0:10:50	SPEAKER_00
 Once we've chosen a concept for it, we can then design the features of our concepts, making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_00
 And of course, we also have to make it look cool.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_00
 That's what we don't want.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_00
 We don't want lots of buttons complicated features.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_00
 We want something that looks nice and simple.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_00
 Here's a fairly simple device. This is an iPod for Mapple.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_00
 I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_00
 It's very minimalistic in its design.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_00
 You use these four buttons to move around a range of settings on a small LCD screen.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_00
 The thing I like about this is that it's very, very quick to access the main features.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_00
 You can just about make up that the bottom three buttons are previous track, next track and playpours.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_00
 The main features of the iPod, the things you will use all the time.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_00
 Then if you want to do anything more advanced, you go into the little menu on the LCD screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and find the more advanced features that you want.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's a good model that we could have.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_00
 Here's another example.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_00
 It's an interesting idea. It looks pretty cool.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_00
 It's got novelty value. It's nice and colorful. It's nice and bright.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_00
 It's also something that you can feel your wear around.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_00
 The buttons are different shapes.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_00
 If you're watching TV in the dark or whatever, you can work out which buttons.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 It's fun.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_00
 I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_00
 You need a few buttons to select your favourite channels.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_00
 Most people when they watch TV, they have 250 channels on their TV and they watch them for them the most.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 You have buttons for your favourite channel, changing the volume, which is something you do all the time when you're watching TV, and a button to switch off in case you get bored.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_00
 Other features, things like adjusting the brightness, tuning the TV, I don't know what else you do with the TV.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_00
 These are all necessary functions.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_00
 You can't have it. There's no point in having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_00
 We need to find a way of including these somehow.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_00
 One of the suggestions I'd make is to include them in a menu system a bit like on the iPod.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_00
 We'd either have a small LCD display on the device itself or have a menu display that comes up on your television and can be controlled through the device.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_00
 I know it would allow you to access the advanced features whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features you use most often.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so you'd be advocating on LCD then?

0:14:20	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's one way to go, yes.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_00
 The advantages and disadvantages, if you have an LCD display, it's nice because it lets you just sit there and control your television from your armchair.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_00
 There are disadvantages and LCD display would have to be quite small because we're...

0:14:43	SPEAKER_00
 I assume we're going to be making quite a small device.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_00
 It would also have to have a kind of backlighting in it because you tend to watch TV in the dark, but you need to be able to see your LCD display.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_00
 Your alternative is to have an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_00
 I don't like how they have these digital boxes where you press the buttons and it comes up with your listing of what's on each channel.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_00
 That's also a good idea.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_00
 It does have its problems as well if you've got a small TV and you're sitting on the other side of a room.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_00
 It's hard to read the little text that comes up.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_00
 But that's the decision that we can make.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_01
 I do think that one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_01
 And so, like favorite channels is applicable, but I think that you do need to have some kind of function where you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_01
 I know I use that often.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 Is that separate from what he was saying?

0:15:52	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if it was an LCD on the remote, I don't know that you would be able to see it.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_03
 We're talking menu contrast and tuning the VCR or something.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_03
 If I've understood you rather than menu as what's on.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_00
 That would be more specifically digital boxes.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_00
 If we put a display on the remote control, communication is one way.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_00
 So you can't have the televisions and information back to your mobile control.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_00
 Good point.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_01
 Now we're moving on to market marketing.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_03
 What F.G.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_03
 Press five eight.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know how relevant all of this is going to be.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_02
 Anything.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, snap plugged in.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_03
 There we go.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_02
 So we're going to look a little bit at trend watching.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_02
 Basically, I was given an executive summary that was.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_02
 I was looking at the market investigation on road controls that was recently conducted.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_02
 And then also some fashion washers and Paris and Milan commented on some things that are going to be going on this year.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_02
 So first, they had people, they ranked the important aspects of remote controls.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_02
 So that's going to be a reference, but that really over the next year that's going to be switching to fancy look and feel remote.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_02
 So that just goes back to the whole desire of our real reaction company wanting to focus on fashion.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_02
 So even though we're stressing, when we're talking, we've all been talking about this simplicity and easy to use idea.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_02
 They're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy looking feel.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_02
 And as these are ranked, the top one is doubly important to the second one, which is doubly important to the third one.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_02
 So just to take that weight into account.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_02
 The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations that would be like if we use something like the space material or the LCD screen, things like that.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_02
 And then ease of use was the third most important.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_02
 So really, no matter what we need to focus the most on fancy look of view, according to this, I don't know what you would get with that.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_02
 And then Fashion Watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes, shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_02
 And that there's a preference for spungy type material.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_02
 And so that brings us to my personal preferences. Who wants this fun to your vote or want to their natural advantage?

0:20:00	SPEAKER_02
 Personally, I don't really think that I want one that's going to go out the style or go stale, excuse the pun, in a year.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_02
 So even though this is coming from us as, you know, trend watch market research, I don't know how much of a BNS is thoroughly want to take away.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_02
 Also, considering that the research has been carried out by real reaction, I'm a little hesitant as to like how these questions may have been worded.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_02
 And if necessarily this whole fashion to technology to ease of use is necessarily the right ranking, personally, like I might reverse it.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_02
 But if we're working for this company, then I guess no matter what we have to stress fashion the most.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_02
 But it doesn't necessarily need to be a spungy material.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_03
 There's all kinds of scope for imagination in that window.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_02
 I don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them that pretty much sums it up.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_02
 So yeah.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, do we have any some questions for this?

0:21:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_02
 What can I possibly might not?

0:21:07	SPEAKER_01
 Do you have any ideas how to possibly use these, how to use a fruitive vegetable or the spungy material at all?

0:21:20	SPEAKER_01
 Like, could we make a like, could we make a spungy remote?

0:21:23	SPEAKER_01
 It would be easier on the hands.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_01
 If it's latex, it's kind of, then it would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_03
 My understanding of latex cases that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside, but it's covered with the latex, which is spun to your own softer on your hands.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_03
 There's something to be said.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, we got that thing earlier from you about not wanting it to our repetitive stress injuries and things.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_03
 So something, something like that.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, I think we don't want to go spungy.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_02
 I think I'm envisioning more like, you know, the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle so that it doesn't hurt.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_02
 You're sitting on it for a long time.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_02
 I'm imagining that sort of thing.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what that feels like.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_03
 Given the list of materials I was forwarded, that seems doable.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_03
 Could we go in fruit and vegetable colors?

0:22:28	SPEAKER_01
 You could color corn either.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_01
 Or maybe like a couple main ones being like an 11s or strawberries.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_01
 The buttons could be finished.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_00
 Could they be smelly?

0:22:34	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, God.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_00
 Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable?

0:22:38	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_00
 Like a carrots or something.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, it's quite carrot shaped.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_03
 Like carrots.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_03
 Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like large, but that's what I was thinking of.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_02
 What about the idea like a round remote instead of like a vertical up and down one?

0:22:52	SPEAKER_02
 In terms of holding it.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_02
 That's a fruit.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_02
 Might have tied in a little.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_01
 I think you'd be able to hold it because I think the reason that long is.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_03
 I think the harder to press, the harder to push.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_00
 When you use a remote, you press the buttons with your thumb usually.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_00
 What are your fingers?

0:23:12	SPEAKER_01
 I usually hold it on one hand, maybe.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_00
 I maybe want something that's shaped like a mobile phone.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_00
 So you hold it in one hand and you press the button.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_01
 The buttons would have to be very small.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_03
 No, I tend to do it.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 But you think they're just your fingers down around.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_01
 But I mean in order to get to all of them, you know, they would have to be within a certain amount of space.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_00
 But it's only got like four or five buttons anyway.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_03
 And it's not so much about it.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_03
 When I'm pressing buttons on my iPod, that's how I do it.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_03
 Hold it and press.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_00
 Hold it in one hand and you press the buttons.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_02
 I love the idea.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_02
 We all like the iPod.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_00
 The button on the iPod, is it just four buttons or is it?

0:24:01	SPEAKER_02
 It's like five.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_03
 There's one in the middle.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_03
 I mean each version of it has been a little bit different.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_01
 The one I have doesn't have the four on it.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_03
 Oh yeah, you have one of the in between ones when they weren't doing that anymore.

0:24:14	None
 And you press the center button.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_03
 That's your all purpose select button right there.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, okay.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_02
 I think why it would be good for us is because you could have the same wheel sort of effect for channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_02
 Like just the idea of like those so few buttons for main things.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_02
 But then how you go back to the menu and like I don't know if we would want it on the screen there on the actual TV.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_02
 I kind of am wanting to say on the TV because if you're changing the brightness, you want to see it happening kind of.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_03
 And it's still how that will be.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_03
 It might be good in theory but not as useful in practice.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_00
 Also, yeah, because you would be looking down at the LCD.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_00
 I'll put your TV.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_01
 We have about 15 minutes left.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm going to continue with my presentation.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_01
 I have one more slide before we close but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about these kinds of things.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_01
 So I'll just bring that up and show you all.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_01
 We'll move on.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_02
 I think I need more information on fruits and vegetables.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_02
 Can we let you know?

0:25:45	SPEAKER_03
 Can we have changeable covers like for your mobile?

0:25:48	SPEAKER_03
 In different fruit and vegetable colors?

0:25:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_01
 And then the covers could be spongy latex, but the actual model could be tidy.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_03
 You could coordinate with your house or whatever.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_03
 It's option.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_00
 The packaging, it should be like a lemon and the packaging is like the peel.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_00
 So that's the opening of the box.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_00
 You just kind of peel it.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_02
 There you go.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_02
 But I've had packages.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_02
 So that was like half the fun.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_02
 It's like the way it all comes off.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_01
 The components concept.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_01
 Energy.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yes.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_03
 I sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't be necessary.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_03
 But this is the agenda they gave me.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_01
 So what can you just explain with that as real quick?

0:26:46	SPEAKER_03
 Decisions.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_03
 Decisions on energy I'm thinking is based on the battery.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_03
 What do people think about this kinetic battery idea?

0:26:57	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's awesome.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's really cool.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's good.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_00
 As long as we consider the cost and how reliable it is.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_03
 I haven't gotten any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_03
 But over time.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_03
 But if we're using a cheaper chip and it even out, I think circuit boards.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_03
 I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_03
 They're thin fiberglass with copper wires etched onto them.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_03
 And I think they're quite easily printed on by machine, which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_03
 I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_03
 I wasn't really given any options.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_03
 I was just given that this is how they're done.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_03
 I can't really tell you.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_03
 I can tell you a whole lot about how it works.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_03
 But I don't know any decisions on.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_01
 If they're really options.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_03
 I'm sorry.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_00
 I think we'll just get to the next one.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_01
 Then we'll move on to the case.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_01
 I guess maybe if we decided on a simple, a regular or an advanced chip.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_03
 Here's the thing on the chips that I got.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_03
 Simple regular advanced chip on print.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_03
 It includes an infrared sensor, so we don't have to worry about that.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_03
 The push button, if we're going to have push buttons, they require a simple chip.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_03
 But a scroll wheel requires a regular chip and an LCD requires advanced.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_03
 Do we want a scroll wheel or do we just want push buttons?

0:28:53	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think we need a scroll wheel.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it might be nice for changing the volume.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't know how useful it would be for changing the channel.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_01
 Because you don't have control over numbers or...

0:29:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_03
 It'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_03
 But if you could scroll down on a scroll wheel.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_02
 If you could scroll through the channels.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_02
 And then the volume would just be...

0:29:22	SPEAKER_01
 We have five minutes left for the meeting.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_02
 And the volume would just be the same way.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_02
 Forward and backward.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_02
 And it would make it much sleeker sort of looking.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_02
 And otherwise, no matter how many buttons we have, we're going to have like, you know, black with red sticking out.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_02
 And it's going to inevitably sort of start looking like...

0:29:41	SPEAKER_02
 That was a group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_01
 So have a scroll for volume.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_03
 Or for all those secret functions.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_03
 When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote...

0:29:57	SPEAKER_03
 Could do for you without the buttons.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_03
 And you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_03
 I think.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_00
 I think a scroll wheel would be nice, but it's not necessary.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_03
 So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip, depending on...

0:30:10	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we could table that design for later.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_01
 I think, well, I think when we go into the user phase, we're going to have to decide...

0:30:21	SPEAKER_01
 The interface, we're going to have to decide whether we're going to have a scroll or not.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_03
 Well, let's think about that while we talk about the case.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, let's do case.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_03
 I'm kind of liking the idea of latex.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_03
 If spongy is the end thing.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_01
 I'm a little hesitant about it because I'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_02
 Well, could it be hard and then something around?

0:30:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_03
 What I've seen just not related to this.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_03
 But of latex cases before is that there's a lot like a hard plastic inside and it just covered with the latex.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_03
 Not too thick a layer of latex, just enough to be grippable like bicandles or anything that you've seen like that.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_03
 The inside is hard.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_03
 I think that that's done for us.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_01
 So we do want latex.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_01
 So, um, I'm probably in colors, maybe fruity vegetable colors.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_01
 Fruity colors.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_01
 Um, let's go to the user interface then.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_01
 We'll come back to the chip, I suppose.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, and we want a curved case.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_03
 Or a double curved.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we don't really know what the difference is, right?

0:31:42	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's curved as some sort.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:45	None
 Yeah.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_03
 So, um, okay.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_01
 Interface the type and the supplements.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_01
 So, push or scroll, right?

0:31:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_00
 Or both.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_00
 Um, and I think if we want to keep our costs, um, we should just go for push buttons.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_00
 Because then we can have a simple chip and it's simpler.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_00
 It's cheaper to make push buttons than it is a scroll button.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_00
 Good point.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_00
 So, in terms of economics, it's probably better than push buttons.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_01
 And if we had an on screen, um, kind of thing that you could scroll through, like you could use your buttons to scroll through things.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_01
 I think that, yeah, for channel surfing, I think a scroll, an actual, like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:37	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_03
 I say push buttons, at least unless we get any information that I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than a push button, but it's got to be some more expensive.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like kinetic battery in the cool case.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_03
 Is that okay with you?

0:32:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_01
 And let's like see if we get anything else.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, I'm not like hard sold on the scroll wheel.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_02
 It's more just to give it a different kind of look.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_02
 But if it's going to be in a latex type thing, and that's going to look cool, then that's probably going to have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_01
 So we're going to go with type push buttons and then supplements.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_01
 How are we going to do that?

0:33:23	SPEAKER_01
 What do you mean by supplements?

0:33:27	SPEAKER_01
 I assume that's what else we're going to, like the additional buttons we can use.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_01
 So we're going to have like a menu button so that we can access on screen things.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_00
 Then, okay.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_00
 So we're doing an on screen menu.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_00
 So what are buttons going to be on off?

0:33:56	SPEAKER_01
 So like one through five or like a radio type sort of situation.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:04	None
 I feel like radio presets.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_00
 I think maybe numbers seems to come off.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_01
 Well, but in order to preset it, oh, you guess you can just hold it down when you get to one.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_00
 When you're scrolling through.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_00
 You need some kind of a nice up-down kind of button.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_01
 Up-down.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_01
 A volume control, a double, but for example.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_01
 Finishing the meeting now.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_01
 Our next meeting starts in 30 minutes.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_01
 You each have things to do, look and feel, design user interface design, product evaluation.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_01
 And you two are going to work together on a prototype using modeling clay.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_01
 You'll get instructions from your personal coach.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_01
 Wow.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_01
 Do we decide on a chip?

0:34:40	SPEAKER_01
 Let's go with a simple chip.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_01
 We are done.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you, everyone.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I think these are already in our shared folder.

0:34:53	None
 Okay.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_03
 Cool.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_03
 It's not too hot.
