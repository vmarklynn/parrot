0:00:00	None
 I was the paper.

0:00:02	None
 Yeah, it was the paper.

0:00:04	None
 Maybe a paper which is used to give a presentation.

0:00:08	None
 Who doesn't have to give a presentation?

0:00:10	None
 We all do. We can switch around as that will keep these.

0:00:14	None
 Okay. All right, just walk these.

0:00:18	None
 No.

0:00:19	None
 Okay.

0:00:20	None
 I see that it moved too long.

0:00:22	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so you'll click for me and stuff like that.

0:00:26	None
 So you can stay seated for years.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:00:29	None
 Okay.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_04
 I hate these things.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_02
 Uh-huh.

0:00:34	None
 That's a great opportunity then to learn how to be patient.

0:00:39	None
 Not my thing.

0:00:42	None
 Yeah.

0:00:43	None
 It's a new thing to learn there, isn't it?

0:00:45	None
 Yeah.

0:00:46	None
 Sorry for holding a sunboss.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_03
 A couple of the tech guys got a little delayed there.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry. I understand you guys have a lot of work to do.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_03
 That's right. We certainly do.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_03
 We boss.

0:00:58	None
 Me, I'm not technically enough to work a clip.

0:01:06	None
 It just clearly doesn't work.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. This thing.

0:01:13	None
 Yeah, we understand why you're a project manager.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_04
 Not technical director, don't we?

0:01:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, we do.

0:01:19	None
 Oh, that's meant to be in there.

0:01:21	None
 Uh-huh.

0:01:22	None
 I see.

0:01:23	None
 Oh.

0:01:24	None
 I know it clips.

0:01:25	None
 That's so good.

0:01:26	None
 Wow.

0:01:27	None
 Cheers, guys.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_00
 So, we are here to talk about functional design.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_00
 Now, hopefully we've all got a better idea from then we did leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_00
 So here's an agenda.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_00
 Uh-huh.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_00
 A lopen.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_00
 You should know that I'll be taking minutes during all the meetings because I was struggling to last time.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_00
 Uh-huh.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_00
 And that will be easier for me now because I'm not actually giving the whole presentation.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_00
 Uh-huh.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_00
 The additional points are just the stuff that we sent and it that I forwarded on from upper management, having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_00
 Um-uh.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_00
 Now, you can all give your presentations.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_00
 We can talk about their requirements.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_00
 And hopefully come to some decisions.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_00
 40 minutes for this meeting.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_00
 So I've got more time than the last one.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_00
 So here's the additional points.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_00
 I just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments on them.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_00
 Uh-uh.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_00
 Did you all receive that email?

0:02:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_00
 So does anyone have any overall?

0:02:36	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I thought- What comes up for me is that if we're going to- if we're going to be marketing a product that is going to be, uh, having no teletext, people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_02
 And so we're not- we're going to be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_02
 So that's from a marketing perspective.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_02
 I-I see- I see a lack.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_02
 And so we have to go, I think in the other direction, what are we going to have that makes this thing better?

0:03:09	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that first point could also be an opportunity because in seeing that teletext becoming outdated, some sort of remote control that can work with the internet, there is the opportunity that's presented against.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, no, I agree with you.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_02
 So what I'm talking about is I see that one side we're eliminating something.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_02
 So we have to come up with another side which is what are we going to be targeting our market, uh, that identifies our product as better than because it doesn't have teletext, it has to have to- to that.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_02
 So that's- That's- that was my reaction.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_00
 So we're quite fixed.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_00
 So they probably in terms of marketing are looking for something that's- that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new featured product.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but we're designing only the remod.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_04
 We're not designing the T-E-V.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_04
 Hmm.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_04
 So we're going to be removing the teletext out of any T-V.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_04
 People use our remote with.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_04
 That's right.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_04
 I think so.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_00
 Which is- There's also the potential for market- There's a market here for lost text.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_00
 For example, someone that just goes to the shop that once a replacement, once it's- It's possible 25 euros is a selling price.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_00
 We really have to innovate here, I guess.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_02
 That's what I'm- That's what I'm talking about.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_02
 Is- Is that we have to find something that is going to be very attractive about this product because somebody- Some people are going to be happy- Unhappy because they- They can't access their teletext.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_02
 Hmm.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_02
 Because we're talking about 80% or 90% or 95% of the televisions out there are- are teletexts.

0:04:33	None
 Yeah.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_02
 So- So it's- It's nothing I'm criticizing the product at all.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_02
 It's just- When we eliminate that, then what do we bring?

0:04:41	SPEAKER_02
 What are we bringing to take the place of this?

0:04:43	SPEAKER_02
 And we have to- In my opinion, we have to double up.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_02
 If we lose one, we need to bring two.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_02
 Or three.

0:04:49	None
 Okay.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_00
 I think that- That last point is probably quite straightforward.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_00
 Obviously, the- The- It has to be branded.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_04
 So the- The double-lar will be a- Or-

0:05:02	SPEAKER_00
 On the product, yeah. I think- Can you hand the-

0:05:06	None
 Can you hand the- Can you hand the- I think Rolls Royce might mine, but don't worry.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_03
 I think- Yeah.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_03
 One of the things that we should also keep in mind when we're doing this- I mean, our company slogan is we put the fashion in electronics, right?

0:05:19	SPEAKER_03
 So I think our kind of- Our target here is to have some kind of very like sleek, nice looking remote.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_03
 And we want it to be functional as well.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_03
 But I think one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like- Like this thing here.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_03
 We don't want a big clunker. We want something that looks nice and- It's fashionable and- So-

0:05:42	SPEAKER_02
 So you have this? Yeah.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_00
 So we have three presentations and I think we'll go in- Order of participant number here.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_00
 So we can have a look at the working design first.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_00
 From participant two. That's- Yes, we know if- That's fine.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so- And now- That's a click on us.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_03
 So you all know me. I'm the industrial designer.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_03
 And we have some basic components that our remote is going to need.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_03
 Just basically every remote will need them.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_03
 We need some kind of power- Power source.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_03
 We have to decide on our user interface, which is his department.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_03
 But the user interface is also a major component.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_03
 We need a programmable digital signal processor to- To take the input from the user and translate that into- Into electronic signal, which we pass to the infrared LED, Which you aim at the television, which- And it receives that signal.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_03
 You need an on-off switch.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know how that got in there.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_03
 And we also need to- If we want a universal remote, we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of TVs.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_03
 So we need to know all the different signals.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_03
 And so that I'll require some memory as well.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_03
 So here's just a basic layout of how- How the remote would work.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_03
 You have the power sources in the upper right-hand corner there.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_03
 And you can see that we have the user interface here, Which is connected to the chip, which does all of our signal processing.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_03
 And then passes that signal on to the infrared LED.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_03
 And that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo transistor.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_03
 So those are the basic components that need to go into this.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_03
 And everything else is pretty much open to move around.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_02
 Would just be considered just a standard- I think any- This is not cutting edge technology we're talking here.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_02
 We're talking about existing technology.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_02
 Right. Nothing's been modified or upgraded or- Yeah, this is just-

0:08:02	SPEAKER_03
 New discoveries. This is just a basic layout of all the components that are going to be absolutely necessary to ever work in remote.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_03
 We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, that- I mean, that you can kind of say what- Would fall under the user interface in the digital signal processing chip.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_00
 Do we have an idea of costs of different components?

0:08:25	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the most costly components are going to be the chip.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_03
 And the- It could also- Basically the user interface and the casing are going to be expensive as well.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_03
 The LED and the transistors and everything else are, you know, they're pretty cheap.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_03
 So depending on what we want our functionality to be, the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_03
 Depending on the amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_03
 Do we have any gold- Do you have any gold-park figures for that yet?

0:08:56	SPEAKER_03
 I don't have any figures right now.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_03
 We have to wait until we get to more specific design phase for that.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_03
 But- And I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual- The actual casing itself and, you know, the- The buttons and things like that.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_03
 The shell.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, basically.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_03
 So yeah, that's all I have really.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, thanks.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_00
 And we have participant three of which I believe is Pedro.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_03
 I-

0:09:40	SPEAKER_00
 You can give you that. Click on.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_00
 And you want to get- We were fighting over it.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_00
 It was almost more fun.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_00
 You're a slideshow.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_00
 It's what you want to do here.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_00
 Just go up to view.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_00
 Click down here.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_04
 That's the one.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_04
 So yeah, function design.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_04
 You guys know me, Pedro.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_04
 And what I found is we want to do fashion.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_04
 And I think honestly we should keep technology low and just simple basically.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_04
 And try to aim for design.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_04
 It's basically a case will- Will cost the same if it looks good or bad.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_04
 So we have to make it look good.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_04
 Something cute and small.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_04
 The big chunk of remotes are dead in the 80s.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_04
 So we should just go for something that people like to actually look at.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_04
 And although most people will buy televisions and everything for- That have loads of loads of little functions and everything.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_04
 And they mostly end up using simple functions and little things.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_04
 And most of people won't get too mad of actually having to go to the- To the television to for instance tune in their stations.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_04
 There's no need to have that in the remote.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_04
 So as for what I would recommend for the- The interference design and I will change the colors on the logo.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_04
 But we should go for the user oriented device.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_04
 So simple controls and good ergonomics.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_04
 And although I still here recommending the teletext, so I'll remove that I guess.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_04
 But we should go for-

0:11:31	SPEAKER_00
 I think what the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that- The teletext would become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_00
 So I still think of it's cheap enough functionality wise to include.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_00
 It really should be in there.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_00
 Because otherwise we're just going to- I mean even if it's necessary or not, if you're given the choice between a remote West teletext or without, when it really, if it isn't more expensive for us to make, because as far as I understand it, it can be operated with the same set of buttons.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_00
 Right, so it should be in there.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_03
 It's just the cost of an extra button.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_03
 I mean software wise there's really no difference.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_02
 I have maybe a silly question.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_02
 In the very beginning it's said with the advent of computers there's going to be- it's going to be outmoded teletext.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_02
 I don't understand how those two things are connected.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_02
 How does computers and teletext, how, why is one eliminating the need of the other?

0:12:30	SPEAKER_02
 I don't understand that.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_00
 Well maybe what we're getting into here is the idea of internet through the TV, for example.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_00
 So that might clear on what we're doing.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, the doer basically aiming at saying that you would use a couple of years ago, teletext would be the easiest way to check like for scheduling, the scheduling in the next program and stuff like that.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_03
 It's not what you're watching even if there's commercials, you know.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_04
 And now you can look at it internet, but I still think teletext is very more convenient until we have the same commodities.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, because I don't see the crossover between computers and television.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_02
 I mean I do see the crossover in some sense, but- But it's not happening yet.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_02
 Well, the remote is used for television.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_02
 So if we make the crossover and we're going to view television on computers, then we're losing the necessity of the remote.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_00
 Well, there is, for example, in digital TV systems, you have, you can press a button and you can buy things in Adverts, and you can view through a catalog, for example.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_00
 A family member remains, it's got a system where you just, and there's other features, for example, in other systems, where you can pause live TV and things like that.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_00
 It just features from the internet, from computers that are coming into the TV, start under the covers.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_00
 But you still use it through a teletext, so- Okay.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_00
 And the things to think here are that there's going to be more functionality.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but we're not, I mean, in command for that.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_04
 That's the thing, all of those require other commands with more complexity and more software.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_03
 I think a lot of this proprietary anyways, you're not going to be able to, you know, like, command a TV with our remote.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_00
 But still, there's an opportunity, if it's, for example, a trainable one, then we're just simply having looking up down the left right, an okay button or something like that, mate.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_00
 Mate, too, as well, and future-proofing it.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but we wouldn't increase the price to try to make it a trainable one, so.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I don't know.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_04
 One way or the other teletext was there, but I guess we can remove it or, you know, make two separate.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_03
 I think if it's possible, you should try to, you know, have a talk with management about that, just, you know.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_02
 I don't see the logic.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_02
 I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_02
 But I'm not a tech mind either.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_02
 I just don't see the crossover between computers and, and, and, we're designing something for a television.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_00
 I'll communicate that back to those guys that, and the message really want to be sending to them is that although teletext may become outdated, there's no logic in not having it in there anyway.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_00
 If it doesn't affect the price.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_00
 We're selling it to an existing market.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_00
 So, the reason why I think that, is to words here, is in terms of thinking of ways to feature for a system for future systems that have something else other than teletext,

0:15:09	SPEAKER_04
 maybe. Yeah, but we're not putting something in the place of teletext.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and, and, and we're also marketing a product.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_02
 What I'm seeing is, is a mid range cost product.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_02
 So, so we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing, because all of a sudden we're going to have cost overruns.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_02
 So, we're going to have a whole bunch of teletext again.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_00
 What are we adding to the product that makes it marketable?

0:15:33	SPEAKER_00
 So, for keeping it basic, what we're looking to sell it basically is it's just being very easy to use, looking exceptionally good.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_00
 That sort of thing, because we really don't have anything else there, do we?

0:15:45	SPEAKER_02
 I don't, I don't see it.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_02
 And to me, if I'm going to market a product for, for beauty, for, for design, I'm going to, I'm going to try to market it at a much higher price.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_02
 I need to make it special with a high price tag.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_02
 I don't want to make it economically competitive.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_02
 I want, I want to market it as exclusive.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_02
 So, I would market this product at, at, at 89 euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_02
 Or something that, but, but I don't think we have that flexibility.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_00
 The same as cheap and functionality is basic.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_00
 Then, 25 euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden standard, standard TV.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_00
 So, the place, the place we're going to justify that cost is through, through design, through making it a, a sleek elegant, high priced, basic remote.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_00
 Does that make sense?

0:16:32	SPEAKER_02
 No, I, I understand what you're saying.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_02
 But what I, what I'm, okay, we probably need to move along.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_02
 And if I'm coming in with a, with, with 25 euros, which is mid market price, then what am I going to give these people for this?

0:16:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_02
 So, that's just my question, but we can keep talking.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. So, can I cut into you now?

0:16:55	SPEAKER_04
 Well, no, I would, I would advocate for continuous teletext and those would be the basic commands.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_04
 As for really the case of design, maybe I'll come up with more concrete ideas right now.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_04
 It's just the idea of simplicity and slickiness, right?

0:17:11	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just thinking, you know, with all these universal remotes that are out there, how many people, how many people actually use every feature that are, you know, like these trainable remotes and things like that, where, you know, it's just so confusing to do, to use all these functions, where I think the largest portion of the market is just going to, you know, they lost their TV remote, they need another one that will work with their TV, they want something that looks nice, that isn't going to break when they drop it, that, you know, that maybe it's, it's ergonomic, it feels good in your hand, something like that.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's going to be where you're going to find the biggest, you know, market share.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_00
 So we're looking for something that looks good and just works, rather than looking for any special features.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_03
 I think the more bells and whistles we add, it's just going to cut into our, into our profits, because I think as we, as we add costs for things like, for, like, if we had the voice recognition and things like that, I think, you know, what percentage of the, of the, of the market is actually going to use that?

0:18:15	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe 5 percent.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we can talk a lot more potentially in the market, actually in presentation about this.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sorry.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sorry, boss.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not the boss.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_02
 Pedro, I just want to say quickly, I would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles, huh?

0:18:34	SPEAKER_02
 You know, things come to my mind is something that's voice activated.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_02
 I know we're getting into some, some big money on this.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's probably a question more for, is that for over here?

0:18:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that's kind of both of us.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_02
 It's the interface.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_02
 Because, and I think, a voice activated, I think of, of, how many times I've, I've lost my, my remote and I can't find it.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_02
 So some way that I can, I can find my remote by, I think in a month.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_00
 Clapping my hands or something.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, and so, so, but that's just something.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 I'm trying to find some bells and whistles, because when I talk about, taking out teletext, it's like, what are we going to put in?

0:19:15	SPEAKER_02
 What makes this thing attractive?

0:19:16	SPEAKER_02
 And it's only for televisions.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_02
 So, every, our, our competition out there has got these, these multiple adapters, where they can use them for their VCRs, their DVDs, their, their televisions.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_02
 And we're coming out with one remote for television only.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_02
 And so, to me, we have to make this a really special product.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_02
 I, I don't, I really have to say, I don't see the market niche for this product.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_02
 At this price, I don't see it yet.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_02
 I, I go along with this because this is what we're given to try to market.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_02
 But I, I don't see the market niche for this product.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_02
 Without, without some really, something really special to identify it as, as unique in the market.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_04
 Well, that should be designed.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_04
 That should be the design, basically.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_04
 I think technology, we, we're not in the price range to do it.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_04
 We don't have the money to do it towards technology.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_04
 So we should, we should do it in the box.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. Well.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_02
 So, so that's up to you then.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_02
 Just to make this box in something that's just absolutely extraordinary.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_02
 We make it in the form of a gun.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_02
 We can sell it in the United States.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_00
 I have a question for you.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_00
 Does any of the features that Peter is spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about it on in terms of just pure functionality?

0:20:37	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know the work or the cost of that.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_03
 I think all these things are pretty standard.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_03
 I think we'll be okay.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_00
 Cheers.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_00
 I need to put this one.

0:20:53	None
 Right.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_02
 You know, for marketing, marketing for me is, and how do I go here?

0:21:06	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_02
 You can just click.

0:21:08	None
 Go.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_04
 There.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_04
 You just get off that.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_04
 You just click.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_04
 Anyway.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_03
 Aha.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_02
 What for me is it's, I don't know what I'm marketing right now.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_02
 Until you spoke and when I wrote this, I don't know what I'm marketing.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_02
 I just know that I was identified as a, we identified ourselves as a developer, as a manufacturer, and as a distributor to other wholesalers.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_02
 And so the 25 euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price, rather than a retail price.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_02
 That's what we decided here.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_02
 So what I did is I decided that this needs to be a product in a sense can market itself.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_02
 So what we've identified here as our main marketing strategy is in design.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_02
 We're making the most beautiful, attractive, whatever we decided is.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_02
 So that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_02
 So I would like to have a product that we can sell easily.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_02
 So I say inspiration.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_02
 So having something beauty, something attractive, something that in a sense will sell itself.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_02
 Innovation, I think, fits into what we're talking about here with design.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_02
 Cutting edge technology, I don't think we're going to have that.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_02
 These were ideas I was putting together, unless we come up with some new age product, as far as the casing is concerned.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_02
 I want to make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe we can have some, I talked about environmentally sensitive.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in the home.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_02
 These are just thoughts.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_02
 I wanted to talk about who we are as a corporation.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_02
 That we're new, we're aggressive, we're competitive, we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_02
 So to me, it's about selling our identity, our corporate identity, along with the product.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_02
 What I found is that the projected costs are competitive.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_02
 We're kind of in the middle of the market.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_02
 But what I'm seeing is that the market is ready for, I identified new technology.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_02
 But again, because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations, I don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_02
 If we could have a technological something.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_02
 I have an idea.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_03
 Please.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_03
 And it's kind of along the lines of environmentally sensitive.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_03
 And it may even fit into ergonomics and even kind of address the issue of losing the remote.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_03
 What we are saying is a kind of an issue.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_03
 What we can do is, well, you know that batteries throwing, robots run through batteries like crazy.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_03
 And solar.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_03
 For some people, well, maybe not a solar remote.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_03
 But instead, what about if we had like a power cradle?

0:24:18	SPEAKER_03
 Like a cradle that is there to hold the remote when you're not using it.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_03
 So you'll always know where the remote is because you have to put it back there to charge the remote.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_03
 And we can instead of having, instead of having replaceable batteries, we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_03
 You never have to go through all these different batteries.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_03
 And also, you can, I think it's a good opportunity for the user design, not just for the user design, but also for the look and feel of the remote as a whole.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_03
 You know, you could have some kind of neat little, you know, a sexy design for a cradle and the remote itself.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I like it.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_02
 I like the idea, but we're talking about in cost is going to probably double.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_03
 It would increase the cost.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_02
 But boy, we can sell this thing because there's no batteries.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_02
 It's environmentally sensitive.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_02
 We can identify it as a safer product in some form.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_03
 And you could page through a moat if you lose it.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe there's a button on the cradle.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's right.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_02
 I really see.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_00
 But the question is, can we make this for less than 1250?

0:25:22	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no, we have to change the end cost.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_00
 I don't necessarily have to change the end cost because can we do that without changing it 1250 per product if we basically can sell more based on this?

0:25:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's going to be up to these guys.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_01
 Well, my reaction is no.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_03
 What I can do is I can look into how we'll page around.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_03
 I can look into how much this might increase our costs.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_03
 And you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is going to have on our final numbers.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, they can certainly push for more expensive products.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_02
 Well, see, I'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_02
 You know, let's sell this thing wholesale for 50 euros.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_02
 60 euros.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_02
 Let's make this thing really exclusive, environmentally sensitive, high tech design, ergonomics, all of this.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_02
 Just make this thing, yeah, the Rolls-Royce of remote controls.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_02
 Every home's got to have, if you don't have one, hey, what kind of remote do you have?

0:26:23	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, you've got one of those.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, fantastic.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_02
 I want one of those, too.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_02
 I just don't have enough money right now.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_03
 I just don't know about that because in order to do that, in order to price it at that kind of level, I think we need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering, like being able to operate, you know, the DVD player and, you know, the stereo system and all that, which is a pretty basic function that we've opted out of.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_03
 And additionally, we're maybe not supporting teletext.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_00
 Now, I think we can see with certainty now that we are supporting teletext.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_03
 I do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_02
 One thing I don't understand is they've given us this package, okay?

0:27:10	SPEAKER_02
 Now, in my opinion, we need to give them a package back, okay?

0:27:13	SPEAKER_02
 They say, okay, here you go.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_02
 They gave us a foundation of what they want.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_02
 And it's our place to kind of analyze and evaluate.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think it's our place to create their product for them.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it is.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what kind of role we have in a corporate ladder.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_02
 But to me, it's like, okay, here's our ideas, okay?

0:27:33	SPEAKER_02
 And then let them look at those ideas and they say, well, we can raise the price 20%.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_02
 You know, we like this idea, this idea, no.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_02
 But to me, it's about a choice.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_02
 Do we follow their directives or do we make presentations back and then discuss?

0:27:51	SPEAKER_02
 Because I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing us right now.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_02
 I don't see it.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_03
 I have to disagree, though.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_03
 I think our market niche is basically people who have lost their remote or have broken their remote and don't want to send back to the manufacturer.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_03
 They just want to run out to the store and get a remote.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_03
 And then they're going to look on the shelf and they're going to see ours is the nicest looking remote.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_03
 It does what they need.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_03
 These aren't...

0:28:17	SPEAKER_00
 I think that... To get to back to another point, sorry, for cutting in, but I think it's important to remember that this remote has to work with multiple TVs, yeah, because it's selling on its own.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_00
 It's not going to be specifically for HITRASHI TVs or...

0:28:30	SPEAKER_00
 What are you going to do?

0:28:31	SPEAKER_00
 So technologically, if I understand that, TVs, TV remotes working exactly the same way as video remotes and DVD remotes.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_00
 All you need to do is train them to the individual one or all you need to do is know they're like some four-digit code.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_00
 So saying that it works with all TVs is equivalent to saying that it'll work with DVDs.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_02
 No, they've identified the product is not working for anything with televisions.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_02
 They've identified this product remote.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_02
 That's why I say I don't see the market niche for this.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_02
 If we were going to have a product that worked for DVDs, VCRs and everything, then I can see the market niche.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_02
 But we're only identified as going for televisions without teletext.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_02
 And it's like, whoa, in my opinion, we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_02
 Well, here's the thing marketable because who wants just a television remote?

0:29:19	SPEAKER_02
 I don't.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_03
 Well, here's my thing about that.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_03
 If you're in the market for this ultimate remote, you're not going to go for just a television remote.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_03
 If it can't control your DVD player and if you can't get that all-in-one ultimate remote that just...

0:29:37	SPEAKER_03
 You can throw all your other remotes away.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not going to buy a 75-year-old remote.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_02
 I have a tendency to agree with you.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_02
 I really do.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_02
 That's why I say I question the marketability of the product.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_02
 I really question where we create the demand.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_00
 We're looking for something basic.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_00
 One thing that you said really struck a chord with me here, and that we're carrying the corporate identity with the product, but we're actually looking for a large profit at the same time, where I've been inclined to go back to a reliable management and say, let's just cut down our profit, expect it on this product, because we are actually branding our company here, we're selling more than just the product.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_00
 We're trying to get MindShare about a real reaction to the people who are going to buy consumer electronics.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_00
 We want people to eventually say, oh, that's real reacting.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_00
 That's a good make. It's reliable.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_00
 And we're going to win MindShare by either being a fantastic product or for it working.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_00
 It just being good, reasonable price and solid.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_00
 So if we can put an emphasis here on not breaking, I think that's in itself.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_00
 That's extremely big.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_02
 If you drop the cost, now if you make good to the other side of the cost scale, and you make it less expensive, then all of a sudden now we're going into a new market area.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_02
 So we can say low cost, good design, beautiful, what did I do?

0:31:00	SPEAKER_02
 But what I'm saying is right now we're middle market.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_00
 It's 25 euros and mid market price for remote.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, for multi-function remote, that's a mid market price.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_02
 Interdiscount right now, you can buy them on sale sometimes for about 18, 19 euro.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_02
 And that's for the multi-functions, DVD, VCR, catchalls.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_02
 And they have them in a little box in the middle.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_02
 And this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_02
 So to me, to market only a television remote control, we have to change consciousness.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_02
 We have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_02
 And I don't know what that is.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_02
 It's got to be low cost or high cost with special design features.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that would be inclined to say if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost, then that's the way we really should play it.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_00
 If we can take it down to 15 rather than 25 and make a low profit margin on it, but we're really doing that to sell the brand.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_00
 We have five minutes left.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_00
 Well, back to sell for real reactions.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_00
 And I can communicate this to the more senior people within the company here to get reactions.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_03
 What about the idea that I had with Cradle?

0:32:24	SPEAKER_03
 How do you feel about that?

0:32:27	SPEAKER_03
 Well, everybody feel that.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_02
 We're talking about the other end now.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_02
 I like it.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_02
 I like the idea.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_03
 We have to find out the other end.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_00
 The problem with that in my mind, I just think off hand is a consumer.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_00
 Would I want to buy that?

0:32:41	SPEAKER_00
 And I think maybe not because I've got a remote and I'll take it to different chairs.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_00
 I'll take it to different, I don't want to go over somewhere and put it down.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_00
 If it's going to be somewhere that you put it down, then it needs to be at the side of your armchair.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_00
 And that implies that there's only one TV user.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_00
 So it's very good for some people.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_03
 It would last for several hours on its own power.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_03
 But when you're done with it, you put it back in the crib.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_00
 But it takes away the ease of use of the remote to set an excuse.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_00
 You have to sort of remember.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_00
 You have to shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_00
 I think in my mind, it doesn't seem like something that, oh, I really want it because of that fact.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_00
 But I don't know, that's just my opinion.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I think, again, we have a cost issue here.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_02
 If we're going to go in this direction to me, we're going to the other side of the cost range.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_02
 Are we going to make this selling the cost as a high tech, environmentally sensitive, whatever, are we going to go to the lower side of the range?

0:33:43	SPEAKER_02
 Again, I don't see our market niche in the middle for our product yet.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_00
 I don't see it yet.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_00
 So what do we think maybe we should petro, do you have any opinion on that?

0:33:53	SPEAKER_04
 We should keep it simple, medium-low cost area and make it look good.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_02
 A question I have in, because I think I agree with you on, we've got to make a debauches.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_02
 The box is going to sell it, I think, the outside casing.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_02
 Can we have multiple designs, have a modern, have a traditional, have a, you know, and so instead of them all looking the same, people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what that creates cost or...

0:34:26	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a...

0:34:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, one over another design.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_03
...over another design.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_04
 So, it's a bit complicated.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_03
 But what we could do is some kind of...

0:34:41	None
 Well, I mean...

0:34:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we need to, I mean, have a few designs to look at and then come up with something that I think we all agree is, you know, the best fit.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_03
 I think what's really important is it has to look good, it has to feel...

0:34:58	SPEAKER_03
 It has to feel good in your hand, it has to be durable, it has to...

0:35:02	SPEAKER_03
 And I think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_03
 I think we have to make sure that people look at it and feel like it's like a quality remote, even though the cost may be a lot.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_02
 What about a remote that doesn't maybe look like a remote?

0:35:23	SPEAKER_02
 Just an idea.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_02
 Just, okay, because I mean we all know what a remote looks like on the outside or selling these things everywhere.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity as we make a remote that doesn't even look like a remote.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_02
 It opens like a telephone.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_03
 Or what if it looks like a pen?

0:35:38	SPEAKER_02
 Doesn't matter, yeah.

0:35:39	SPEAKER_02
 I'm just just talking about some point or something to make this thing unique.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_02
 That's the thing, I'm going to keep thumping up.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_02
 I'll sell whatever you guys designed.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_02
 I don't have a problem selling a product.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_02
 That's not the issue.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_02
 I give you ideas, you guys create a product.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_02
 Once you have the finished product, I'll find a way to sell it.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_02
 Don't worry about it.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_02
 I just give you these things now because these are my thoughts and feelings.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_03
 Just to touch on my point one last time that I had brought up, unless you guys are die hard against the fact that it's possible that it reduces the usability of the remote in the fact that you can't lose it on your own, I think it still might be a good idea to investigate having a power cradle.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_03
 Because in a certain sense, it almost, for me, I would want to have that just because I know at the end of when I'm done watching TV that when I'm done, oh, I better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe that's just some people that like that.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_00
 There's all sorts of remote controls.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_00
 I remember that this hasn't been done in a while, I think, but as a watch.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_00
 As a watch.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, there's remote control watches.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_00
 But I think there are, sorry, 80s things so it might not be easy to market in it.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_00
 But the two watches came along that it might be cheaper to make.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_00
 Now those things might have been expensive for all I know.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_02
 One thing I just thought about when you were saying that is it, our target market is going to be someone who has lost or broken.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_02
 That's what I was saying.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_02
 Who's lost or broken their remote.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_02
 So how many remotes do they want to buy?

0:37:13	SPEAKER_02
 Can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one?

0:37:20	SPEAKER_02
 And so with this kind of system or a locator or something, to think about how have people been losing or breaking their remotes?

0:37:28	SPEAKER_02
 How does this happen?

0:37:29	SPEAKER_02
 In a small presumably.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_02
 And then design the product maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if we're going down that, then we don't need to go.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_00
 It strikes me that the locator feature might actually be quite expensive to make.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_00
 Whereas actually just putting it in the power cradle might not be too expensive at all because that's just done with mobile phones.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_00
 We have the low-speed system.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_00
 So we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_00
 We need to look into whether we can do that.

0:38:01	SPEAKER_00
 But I think we have some mobile phone based products checking quickly or internet.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_00
 We really need to finish up here.

0:38:09	SPEAKER_02
 We can make it in a shape of a coffee pot.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we have the power adapter products.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_00
 We sell power adapter products.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_00
 So for example, there's nothing stopping us.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's telling us to stop from meeting.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_02
 So we have the, we probably have online in our system.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_02
 We have the ability to create this we're talking about.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, without it being too, in fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already going to be in place.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_02
 If we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics.

0:38:40	SPEAKER_03
 I think one of the things that we can put right on the boxes never buy another battery.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you know, something like that.

0:38:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, thanks guys.

0:38:50	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, that's not what I want.

0:38:54	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, look at here.

0:38:59	None
 We need to leave.

0:39:01	None
 We have to leave.

0:39:02	None
 But I don't want to leave.

0:39:03	None
 I like it.
