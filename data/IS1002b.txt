0:00:00	None
 I wasn't paying for it.

0:00:02	None
 Yeah, I wasn't paying for it.

0:00:04	None
 Maybe Pedro, which is here, still in presentation.

0:00:08	None
 Who doesn't?

0:00:09	None
 We all do. We can switch around.

0:00:12	None
 Okay.

0:00:14	None
 All right.

0:00:17	None
 Swap these.

0:00:18	None
 No.

0:00:19	None
 Okay.

0:00:20	None
 I see that it moves your mind.

0:00:22	None
 Okay.

0:00:23	SPEAKER_04
 So, you'll click for me and stuff like that.

0:00:26	None
 See, you can stay seated for years.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. Okay.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_04
 I hate these things.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_02
 Aha.

0:00:35	None
 That's a great opportunity to learn how to be patient.

0:00:39	None
 Not my thing.

0:00:42	None
 Yeah.

0:00:43	None
 It's a new thing to learn there, isn't it?

0:00:45	None
 Yeah.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry for holding us up, boss.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_03
 A couple of the tech guys got a little delayed there.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_00
 That's all right. I understand you guys have a lot of work there.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_03
 That's right. We certainly do.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_03
 We're both.

0:01:03	None
 Me, I'm not technical enough to work a clip.

0:01:06	None
 Which clearly doesn't work.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_02
 Damn.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_02
 This thing.

0:01:13	None
 Yeah, well, we understand why you're a project manager and not technical director, don't we?

0:01:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, we do.

0:01:19	None
 Oh, that's meant to be in there.

0:01:21	None
 Aha.

0:01:22	None
 I see.

0:01:23	None
 Oh.

0:01:24	None
 Oh, that's so good.

0:01:26	None
 Wow.

0:01:28	None
 Cheers, guys.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_00
 So, we are here to talk about functional design.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_00
 Now, hopefully we've all got a better idea from than we did for leaving the last meeting as to what it is we're up to now.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_00
 So, here's an agenda.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_00
 A lot of them.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_00
 You should know that I'll be taking minutes in all the meetings as I was struggling to last time.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_00
 And that'll be easier for me now because I'm not actually giving the whole presentation.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_00
 The additional points are just the stuff that was sent that I forwarded on from upper management, having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_00
 Now, you can all give your presentations.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_00
 We can talk about their requirements and hopefully come to some decisions.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_00
 40 minutes for this meeting, so I bit more time than last one.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_00
 Here's the additional points.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_00
 I just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments on them.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_00
 Did you all receive that email?

0:02:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_00
 So, does anyone have any overall?

0:02:36	SPEAKER_02
 Well, what comes up for me is that if we're going to be marketing a product that is going to be having no teletext, people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_02
 And so, we're not, we're going to be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_02
 So, that's from a marketing perspective.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_02
 I see a lack.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_02
 And so, we have to go, I think, in the other direction, what are we going to have that makes this thing better than...

0:03:10	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that first point could also be an opportunity because we've got some outdated, some sort of remote control that can work with the internet.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_00
 There is the opportunity that's presented, I guess.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, no, I agree with you.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_02
 So, what I'm talking about is I see that one side, we're eliminating something, so we have to come up with another side, which is what are we going to be targeting our market that identifies our product as better than because it doesn't have teletext, it has dot to dot to dot.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_02
 So, that's... that was my reaction.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television, so we're quite fixed.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_00
 So, we're really probably in terms of marketing and looking for something that's... that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new featured product.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_04
 But we're designing only the remote, we're not designing the TV.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_04
 So, we're going to be removing the teletext out of any TV.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_04
 People use our remote with.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_04
 That's right.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_04
 Which is kind of a stupid thing.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_00
 There's also the potential for market.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_00
 There's a market here for lost to out-text.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_00
 For example, someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement once it's too possible, 25 euros is a selling price.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_00
 We really have to innovate here, I guess.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_02
 That's what I'm talking about is that we have to find something that is going to be very attractive about this product because some people are going to be unhappy because they can't access their teletext.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_02
 Because we're talking about 80% or 90% or 95% of the televisions out there are teletexts.

0:04:33	None
 Yeah.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_02
 It's nothing of criticizing the product at all.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_02
 It's just when we eliminate that, then what do we bring?

0:04:42	SPEAKER_02
 What are we bringing to take the place of this?

0:04:44	SPEAKER_02
 In my opinion, we have to double up.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_02
 If we lose one, we need to bring two or three.

0:04:49	None
 Okay.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_00
 I think that last point is probably quite straightforward.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_00
 Obviously, it has to be branded.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_04
 So the double R will be on the product.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_04
 I think one of the things that we should also keep in mind when we're doing this, I mean our company slogan is we put the

0:05:10	SPEAKER_03
 fashion in electronics, right? So I think our target here is to have some kind of very sleek, nice looking remote and we want it to be functional as well.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_03
 So we're going to be able to do that.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_03
 So you have this.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_03
 So we have three presentations and I think we'll go in order of participant number here.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_03
 So we can have a look at the work that's in the

0:05:42	SPEAKER_00
 website and we can have a look at the program.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_00
 So we have three presentations and I think we'll go in order of participant number here.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_00
 So we can have a look at the working design first and

0:05:58	None
 participant two. That's...

0:06:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:06:01	None
 That's fine.

0:06:02	None
 Okay.

0:06:03	None
 Okay.

0:06:04	None
 So...

0:06:05	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to have that to click it on us.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_03
 So you all know me.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_03
 I'm the industrial designer.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_03
 And we have some basic components that our remote is going to need.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_03
 Just basically every remote will need them.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_03
 We have a power source.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_03
 We have to decide on our user interface, which is his department, but the user interface is also a major component.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_03
 We need a programmable digital signal processor to take the input from the user and translate that into electronic signal which we pass to the infrared LED which you aim at the television and it receives that signal.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_03
 You need an on-off switch.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know how that got in there.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_03
 And we also need to have the...

0:06:57	SPEAKER_03
 If we want a universal remote, we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of TVs.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_03
 So we need to know all the different signals and so that will require some memory as well.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_03
 So here's just a basic layout of how the remote would work.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_03
 You have the power sources in the upper right-hand corner there and you can see that we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all of our signal processing and then passes that signal into the infrared LED and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo transistor.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_03
 So those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is pretty much open to move around.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_02
 It would just be considered just a standard...

0:07:54	SPEAKER_02
 This is not cutting edge technology we're talking here.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_02
 We're talking about existing technology.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_02
 Nothing's been modified or upgraded or new discoveries.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_03
 This is just a basic layout of all the components that are going to be absolutely necessary to have a working remote.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_03
 We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_03
 I mean that you can kind of say would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_00
 Do we have an idea of costs of different components?

0:08:25	SPEAKER_03
 Well the most costly components are going to be the chip and basically the user interface and the casing are going to be expensive as well.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_03
 The LED and the transistors and everything else are pretty cheap.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_03
 So depending on what we want our functionality to be, the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_03
 Depending on the amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_03
 Do we have any ballpark figures for that yet?

0:08:56	SPEAKER_03
 I don't have any figures right now.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_03
 We have to wait until we get to the more specific design phase for that.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_03
 And I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual casing itself and the buttons and things like that.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_03
 Basically.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_03
 So that's all I have really.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, thanks.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_00
 And we have participants through which I believe is Pedro.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_03
 Bye.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_00
 You can give you that.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_00
 Go on.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_00
 And you want to get?

0:09:47	SPEAKER_00
 We're fighting over it.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_00
 There's almost more fun.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_00
 You're a slideshow?

0:09:51	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's what you want to do here.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_00
 Just go up to view.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_00
 Click down here.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_04
 So yeah, function design.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_04
 You guys know me, Pedro.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_04
 And what I've found is we want to do fashion and I think honestly we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_04
 It's basically a case we'll cost the same if it looks good or bad.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_04
 So we have to make it look good.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_04
 Something cute and small.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_04
 The big chunk of remotes are that in the 80s so we should just go for something that people like to actually look at.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_04
 And although most people will buy televisions and everything that have loads of little functions and everything.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_04
 And they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most of people won't get too mad of actually having to go to the television to, for instance, tune in their stations.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_04
 There's no need to have that in the remote.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_04
 So as for what I would recommend for the interfances and I will change the colors on the logo.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_04
 But we should go for the user oriented device.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_04
 So simple controls and good ergonomics.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_04
 And although I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that I guess.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_04
 But we should go for the...

0:11:31	SPEAKER_00
 I think what the management recommendation was less that theres a worry that teletext would become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_00
 So I still think if it's cheap enough functionality wise to include it really should be in there.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_00
 Because otherwise we're just going to...

0:11:47	SPEAKER_00
 I mean even if it's necessary or not, if you're given the choice between a remote west teletext or without.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_00
 When it really, if it isn't more expensive for us to make because as far as I understand it, it can be operated with the same set of buttons.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_00
 So it should be in there.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_03
 It's just the cost of an extra button. I mean software wise there's really no difference.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_02
 I have maybe a silly question.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_02
 In the very beginning it said with the advent of computers there's going to be outmoded teletext.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_02
 I don't understand how those two things are connected.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_02
 How does computers and teletext...

0:12:26	SPEAKER_02
 Why is one eliminating the need of the other? I don't understand that.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_00
 Well maybe what we're getting into here is the idea of internet through the TV for example.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_00
 So that might play on what we can do.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_04
 They're basically aiming at saying that you would use a couple of years ago teletext would be the easiest way to check for a...

0:12:44	SPEAKER_04
 Scheduling.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_04
 The scheduling.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_04
 The next program and stuff like that.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_03
 Let's find out what you're watching even if there's commercials.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_04
 And now you can look at it on the internet.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_04
 But I still think teletext is quite more convenient.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_04
 Until you have the same commodities.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_02
 I don't see the crossover between computers and television.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_02
 I do see the crossover in some sense.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_02
 But it's not happening.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_02
 The remote is used for television.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_02
 So if we make the crossover and we're going to view television on computers...

0:13:13	SPEAKER_00
 Then we're losing the necessity of the remote.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_00
 Well there is for example in digital TV systems you can press a button and buy things in adverts.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_00
 And you can view through a catalog for example. A family member has got a system where you just...

0:13:28	SPEAKER_00
 And there's other features for example in other systems where you can pause live TV and things like that.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_00
 It just features from the internet.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_00
 From computers that are coming into the TV under the covers.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_00
 But you still use it through a teletext.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_00
 So the things to think here are that there's going to be more functionality.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah but we're not aiming to recommend for that.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_04
 That's the thing. All of those require other commands with more complexity and more software.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_03
 I think a lot of that's proprietary anyways. You're not going to be able to command a TV with our remote.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_00
 But still there's an opportunity if it's for example a trainable one then we're just simply having an up-down left-right.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_00
 An okay button or something like that might do as well in future proofing it.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_04
 Well I don't know. One way or the other teletext was there but I guess we can remove it or make two separate.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_03
 I think if possible you should try to talk with management about that.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_02
 I don't see the logic. I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_02
 But I'm not a tech mind either. I just don't see the crossover between computers.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_02
 Because we're designing something for television.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_00
 I'll communicate that back to those guys. The message we really want to be sending to them is that although teletext may become outdated there's no logic in not having it in there anyway. It doesn't affect the price.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_00
 We're selling it to an existing market.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_00
 I think what they're pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future proof for a system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_04
 We're not putting anything in the place of teletext.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_02
 We're also marketing a product. What I'm seeing is a mid-range cost product.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_02
 We can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing because all of a sudden we're going to have cost overruns.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_02
 If we're going to choose to drop teletext again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable?

0:15:31	SPEAKER_00
 So for keeping it basic, what we're looking to sell it basically is it's just being very easy to use, looking exceptionally good.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_00
 That's what I think because we really don't have anything else there, do we?

0:15:44	SPEAKER_02
 I don't see it. And to me if I'm going to market a product for beauty, for design, I'm going to try to market it at a much higher price.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_02
 I need to make it special with a high price tag. I don't want to make it economically competitive.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_02
 I want to market it as exclusive. So I would market this product at 89 euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_02
 But I don't think we have that flexibility.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_00
 If design is cheap and functionality is basic then 25 euros is probably a high price for commoner garden standard TVs.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_00
 So the place where we're going to justify that cost is through design, through making it a sleek elegant high priced basic remote.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_00
 Does that make sense?

0:16:32	SPEAKER_02
 No, I understand what you're saying.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_02
 But what I'm... Okay, we probably need to move along.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_02
 My concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_02
 And if I'm coming in with 25 euros which is mid-market price, then what am I going to give these people for this?

0:16:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_02
 So that's just my question. But we can keep talking.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. Sorry, can I cut into you there?

0:16:55	SPEAKER_04
 No, I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_04
 As for really the case of design, maybe I'll come up with more concrete ideas right now.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_04
 It's just the idea of simplicity and slickness, cute and small.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just thinking with all these universal remotes that are out there, how many people actually use every feature that are...

0:17:21	SPEAKER_03
 like these trainable remotes and things like that, where it's just so confusing to use all these functions.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_03
 I think the largest portion of the market is just going to... They lost their TV remote, they need another one that will work with their TV.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_03
 They want something that looks nice, that isn't going to break when they drop it, that maybe it's ergonomic, it feels good in your hand, something like that.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's going to be where you're going to find the biggest market share.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_00
 So we're looking for something that looks good and just works rather than looking for any special features.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_03
 I think the more bells and whistles we add, it's just going to cut into our profits because I think as we add costs for things like...

0:18:07	SPEAKER_03
 if we had the voice recognition and things like that, I think what percentage of the market is actually going to use that?

0:18:16	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe 5%.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_00
 We can talk a lot more potentially in the marketing presentation about this.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut. Sorry, boss. I'm not the boss.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_02
 Pedro, I just want to say quickly, I would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles, huh?

0:18:34	SPEAKER_02
 Well, the thing that come to my mind is something that's voice-activated.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_02
 I know we're getting into some big money on this.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's probably a question more for...

0:18:47	SPEAKER_00
 Is that for over here?

0:18:48	SPEAKER_02
 That's the idea.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_02
 And I think of voice-activated. I think of how many times I've lost my remote and I can't find it.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_02
 So some way that I can find my remote, by clapping my hands or something.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_02
 And so...

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 But that's just something. I'm trying to find some bells and whistles because when I talk about taking out teletext, it's like, what are we going to put in?

0:19:15	SPEAKER_02
 What makes this thing attractive? And it's only for televisions.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_02
 So our competition out there has got these multiple adapters where they can use them for their VCRs, their DVDs, their televisions.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_02
 And we're coming out with one remote for television only.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_02
 And so to me, we have to make this a really special product.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_02
 I really have to say, I don't see the market niche for this product. At this price, I don't see it yet.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_02
 I go along with this because this is what we're given to try to market. But I don't see the market niche for this product.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_02
 Without something really special to identify it as unique in the market.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_04
 That should be designed.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_04
 That should be the design, basically. I think technology, we're not in the price range to do it.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_04
 We don't have the money to do it towards technology, so we should have to do it in the box.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. Well, so that's up to you then.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_02
 To make this box in something that's just absolutely extraordinary.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_02
 We can make it in the form of a gun. We can sell it in the United States.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_00
 I have a question for you. Does any of the features that Pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about in terms of just pure functionality?

0:20:37	SPEAKER_00
 In terms of making the worker the cost of that?

0:20:40	SPEAKER_03
 I think all these things are pretty standard. I think we'll be okay.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_00
 Cheers.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_00
 And to participant.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_02
 Well, for marketing for me is...

0:21:05	SPEAKER_02
 And how do I go here? Okay.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_04
 You can just click.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_04
 Go.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_03
 There you go. You just get off that. You just click anywhere.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_02
 Uh-huh.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. What for me is it... I don't know what I'm marketing right now.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. Until you spoke and when I wrote this, I don't know what I'm marketing.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_02
 I just know that I was identified as a... We identified ourselves as a developer, as a manufacturer, and as a distributor to other wholesalers.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_02
 And so the 25 euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_02
 That's what we decided here.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_02
 So what I did is I decided that this needs to be a product and a sense can market itself.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_02
 So what we've identified here as our main marketing strategy is in design.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_02
 We're making the most beautiful, attractive, whatever we decide it is.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_02
 So that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_02
 So I would like to have a product that we can sell easily.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_02
 So I saw inspiration. So having something beauty, something attractive, something that in a sense will sell itself.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_02
 Innovation, I think, fits into what we're talking about here with design.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_02
 Cutting-edge technology, I don't think we're going to have that.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_02
 These were ideas I was putting together unless we come up with some new age product as far as the casing is concerned.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_02
 I want to make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe we can have some... I talked about environmentally sensitive.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in the home.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know. These are just thoughts.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_02
 I wanted to talk about who we are as a corporation.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_02
 That we're new, we're aggressive, we're competitive, we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_02
 So to me, it's about selling our identity, our corporate identity along with the product.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_02
 What I found is that the projected costs are competitive.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_02
 We're kind of in the middle of the market.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_02
 But what I'm seeing is that the market is ready for... I identified new technology.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_02
 But again, because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations, I don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_02
 If we could have a technological something.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_02
 I have an idea.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_03
 Please.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_03
 And it's kind of along the slides of environmentally sensitive and it may even fit into ergonomics and even kind of address the issue of losing the remote.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_03
 What we're saying is a common issue.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_03
 What we can do is, well, you know that batteries, throwing robots run through batteries like crazy.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_03
 And for some people, maybe not a solar remote, but instead what about if we had a power cradle?

0:24:18	SPEAKER_03
 A cradle that is there to hold the remote when you're not using it.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_03
 So you'll always know where the remote is because you have to put it back there to charge the remote.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_03
 And instead of having replaceable batteries, we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_03
 You never have to go through all these different batteries.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_03
 And also, you can, I think it's a good opportunity for the user design, not just for the user design, but also for the look and feel of the remote as a whole.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_03
 You know, you could have some kind of neat little, you know, sexy design for a cradle in the remote itself.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I like it. I like the idea, but we're talking about end cost is going to probably double.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_03
 It would increase the cost.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_02
 But boy, we can sell this thing because there's no batteries. It's environmentally sensitive.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_02
 We can identify it as a safer product in some form.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_03
 And you could page the remote if you lose it. Maybe there's a button on the cradle.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yep. That's right. I really see.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_00
 No, the question is, can we make this for less than 1250?

0:25:22	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no, we have to change the end cost.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_00
 I don't necessarily have to change the end cost because can we do that without changing it 1250 per product if we basically can sell more based on this?

0:25:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's going to be up to these guys.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_01
 Well, my reaction is no.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_03
 What I can do is I can look into, Pedro and I can look into how much this might increase our costs.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_03
 And you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is going to have in our final numbers.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, they can certainly push for more expensive products.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_02
 I'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_02
 Let's sell this thing wholesale for 50 euros, 60 euros.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_02
 Let's make this thing really exclusive, environmentally sensitive, high tech design, ergonomics, all of this.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_02
 Just make this thing the Rolls Royce of remote controls.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_02
 Every home's got to have, if you don't have one, what kind of remote do you have?

0:26:24	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, you've got one of those. Oh, fantastic. I want one of those too.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_02
 I just don't have enough money right now.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_03
 I just don't know about that because in order to price it at that kind of level, I think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_03
 Being able to operate the DVD player and the stereo system and all that, which is a pretty basic function that we've opted out of.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_03
 And additionally, we're maybe not supporting teletext.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_00
 I think we can see with certainty now that we are supporting teletext.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_03
 But I do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_02
 One thing I don't understand is they've given us this package.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_02
 Now, in my opinion, we need to give them a package back.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_02
 They say, okay, here you go.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_02
 They give us a foundation of what they want.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_02
 And it's our place to kind of analyze and evaluate.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think it's our place to create their product for them.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it is.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what kind of role we have in a corporate ladder.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_02
 But to me, it's like, okay, here's our ideas.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_02
 And then let them look at those ideas and they say, yeah, well, we can raise the price 20%.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_02
 We like this idea, this idea, no.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_02
 But to me, it's about a choice.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_02
 Do we follow their directives or do we make presentations back and then discuss?

0:27:51	SPEAKER_02
 Because I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing us right now.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_02
 I don't see it.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_03
 I have to disagree, though.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_03
 I think our market niche is basically people who have lost their remote or have broken their remote and don't want to send back to the manufacturer.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_03
 They just want to run out to the store and get a remote.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_03
 And then they're going to look on the shelf and they're going to see ours is the nicest-looking remote.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_03
 It does what they need.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_03
 I think that-

0:28:18	SPEAKER_00
 And to get to back to another point, sorry, for cutting in, but I think it's important to remember that this remote has to work with multiple TVs, yeah, because it's selling on its own.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_00
 It's not going to be specifically for Hitash TV's or whatever.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_00
 I understand it.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_00
 So technologically, if I understand it, TV's remote's working exactly the same way as video remotes and DVD remotes.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_00
 All you need to do is train them to the individual one or all you need to do is know they're like some four-digit code.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_00
 So saying that it works with all TVs is equivalent to saying that it'll work with DVDs.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_00
 Nope.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_02
 They've identified the product as not working for anything with televisions.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_02
 They've identified as product limitations.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_02
 That's why I say I don't see the market niche for this.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_02
 If we were going to have a product that worked for DVDs, VCRs and everything, then I can see the market niche.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_02
 But we're only identified as going for televisions without teletext.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_02
 And it's like, whoa, in my opinion, we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable because who wants just a television remote?

0:29:19	SPEAKER_02
 I don't.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_03
 Well, here's my thing about that.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_03
 If you're in the market for this ultimate remote, you're not going to go for just a television remote.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_03
 If it can't control your DVD player and if you can't get that all-in-one ultimate remote that you can throw all your other remotes away, I'm not going to buy a 75-year-old remote.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_02
 I have a tendency to agree with you.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_02
 I really do.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_02
 That's why I say I question the marketability of the product.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_02
 I really question where we create the demand.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_00
 We're really looking for something basic.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_00
 One thing that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we're carrying the corporate identity with the product, but we're actually looking for a large profit at the same time where I've been inclined to go back to a product level management and say, let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_00
 We're selling more than just the product.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_00
 We're trying to get mind-share about a real reaction to the people who are going to buy consumer electronics.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_00
 We want people to eventually say, oh, that's real reaction.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_00
 That's a good make.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_00
 It's reliable.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to win mind-share by either being a fantastic product or for working, just being good, reasonable priced and solid.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_00
 If we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking, I think that's in itself extremely...

0:30:42	SPEAKER_00
 That's big.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_02
 If you drop the cost, now if you make go to the other side of the cost scale and you make it less expensive, then all of a sudden now we're going into a new market area.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_02
 We can say low cost, good design, beautiful, what did that, but what I'm seeing is right now we're middle market.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_00
 It's 25 euros a mid-market price for a remote.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_02
 For multi-function remote, that's a mid-market price.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_02
 In your discount right now you can buy them on sale sometimes for about 18, 19 euro.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_02
 That's for the multi-functions, DVD, VCR, catch-alls.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_02
 They have them in a little box in the middle.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_02
 This is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_02
 To market only a television remote control, we have to change consciousness.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_02
 We have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what that is.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_02
 It's got to be low cost or high cost with special design features.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_00
 I'd be inclined to say if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost, then that's the way we really should play it.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_00
 If we can take it down to 15 rather than 25 and make a low profit margin on it, but we're really doing that to sell the brand.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_00
 We're five minutes left.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_00
 To sell for real reactions.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_00
 I can communicate this to the more senior people within the company here to get reactions.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_03
 What about the idea that I had with Cradle?

0:32:25	SPEAKER_03
 How do you feel about that?

0:32:26	SPEAKER_03
 How does everybody feel about that?

0:32:30	SPEAKER_02
 We're talking about the other end now.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_02
 I like the idea.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_03
 We have to find out the other end.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_00
 The problem with that in my mind, I just think of and as a consumer, would I want to buy that?

0:32:42	SPEAKER_00
 I think maybe not because I've got a remote and I'll take it to different chairs.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_00
 I don't want to go over somewhere and put it down.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_00
 If it's going to be somewhere that you put it down, then it needs to be at the side of your armchair and that implies that there's only one TV user.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_00
 It's very good for some people.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_03
 It would last for several hours on its own power.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_03
 When you're done with it, you put it back in the crib.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_00
 It takes a bit of ease of use of the remote to set an extent.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_00
 You have to sort of remember, you have to shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_00
 I think in my mind, it doesn't seem like something that I really want because of that fact.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know, that's just my opinion.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_02
 Again, we have a cost issue here.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_02
 If we're going to go in this direction to me, we're going to the other side of the cost range.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_02
 Are we going to make this selling the cost as a high-tech, environmentally sensitive, whatever, are we going to go to the lower side of the range?

0:33:42	SPEAKER_02
 Again, I don't see our market niche in the middle for our product yet.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_00
 I don't see it yet.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_00
 So what do we think maybe we should, Pedro, do you have any opinion on that?

0:33:52	SPEAKER_04
 We should keep it simple, medium-low cost area and make it look good.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_02
 A question I have, because I think I agree with you, we've got to make it the box.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_02
 The box is going to sell it, I think, the outside of the casing.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_02
 Can we have multiple designs?

0:34:15	SPEAKER_02
 Have a modern, have a traditional, have a, you know, and so instead of them all looking the same, people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what that creates cost or...

0:34:26	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a...

0:34:31	SPEAKER_03
 One over and over design.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_04
 I hear that.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's a bit complicated.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_03
 But what we could do is some kind of...

0:34:39	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I mean, yeah, we need to, I mean, have a few designs to look at and then come up with something that I think we all agree is, you know, the best fit.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_03
 I think what's really important is it has to look good, it has to feel good in your hand, it has to be durable.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_03
 And I think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_03
 I think we have to make sure that people look at it and feel like it's like a quality remote, even though the cost may be...

0:35:14	SPEAKER_02
 What about a remote that doesn't maybe look like a remote?

0:35:23	SPEAKER_02
 Just an idea.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_02
 Just...

0:35:25	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, because I mean, we all know what a remote looks like on the outside, they're selling these things everywhere.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity is we make a remote that doesn't even look like a remote.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_02
 It opens like a telephone.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_03
 Or what if it looks like a pen?

0:35:37	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't matter, yeah.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_02
 And then just talking about some...

0:35:40	SPEAKER_02
 Something to make this thing unique.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_02
 That's the thing.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_02
 Something I'll sell whatever you guys design.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_02
 I don't have a problem selling a product.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_02
 That's not the issue.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_02
 I give you ideas you guys create the product.

0:35:51	SPEAKER_02
 Once you have the finished product, I'll find a way to sell it.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_02
 Don't worry about it.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_02
 I just give you these things now because these are my thoughts and feelings.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_03
 So just to touch on my point one last time that I had brought up, I really...

0:36:05	SPEAKER_03
 Unless you guys are die-hard against the fact that it's possible, it reduces the usability of the remote in the fact that you can't lose it on your own.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_03
 I think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_03
 Because I really think in a certain sense, it almost like for me, I would want to have that just because I know at the end of when I'm done watching TV that when I'm done, oh, I better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe that's just some people that like that.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, there's also remote controls that I remember that worked.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_00
 This hasn't been done in a while, I think, but as a watch.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_00
 As a watch.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, there was remote control watches.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_00
 But I think there are, sorry, 80s things, so it might not be easy to market in it.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_00
 But the technologies came along that it might be cheaper to make.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_00
 Now those things might have been expensive for all I know.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_02
 One thing I just thought about when you were saying that is that our target market is going to be someone who has lost or broken.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_02
 That's what I was saying.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_02
 Who's lost or broken their, their remote.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_02
 So how many remotes do they want to buy?

0:37:14	SPEAKER_02
 Can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one?

0:37:20	SPEAKER_02
 And so with this kind of system or a locator or something to think about how have people been losing or breaking their remote?

0:37:28	SPEAKER_02
 How does this happen?

0:37:29	SPEAKER_02
 They'll also presumably.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_02
 And then design the product maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if we're going down that then we can, we don't need to go, it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be quite expensive to make.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_00
 Whereas actually just putting it in the power cradle might not be too expensive at all because that's just done with mobile phones.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_00
 You can just, we have the locator.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_00
 So we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_00
 We need to look into whether we can do that, but I think we have some mobile phone based products checking quickly our internet.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_00
 We really need to finish up here.

0:38:09	SPEAKER_02
 But we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we have the power adapter products.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_00
 We sell power adapter products.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_00
 So for example, there's nothing stopping us.

0:38:19	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's telling us to stop from meeting.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_02
 So we have the, we probably have, have online in our, in our system.

0:38:25	SPEAKER_02
 We have the ability to create this we're talking about.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, without it being too.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_00
 In fact, we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already going to be

0:38:34	SPEAKER_02
 in place here. If we can create this, we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics.

0:38:40	SPEAKER_03
 I think one of the things that we can put right on the box is never buy another battery.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_03
 You know, something like that.

0:38:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:38:47	SPEAKER_00
 Thanks guys.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_02
 No, that's nobody want to want.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, look at here.

0:38:58	None
 We have to leave.

0:39:02	None
 I don't, but I don't want to leave.

0:39:10	None
 Just because you learn more, do not want to go without your application and others because you can essentially provide that value over there and help out.
