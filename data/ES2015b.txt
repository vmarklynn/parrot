0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 This is some great facial expressions, Matthew.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_01
 Remember it's not real.

0:00:34	None
 Yeah, it's okay.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_01
 You're going to be the first one on PowerPoint.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_01
 I'll just like hook you up with that.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_01
 Am I starting now?

0:00:58	SPEAKER_01
 Welcome back to the second meeting.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_01
 I hope you had a productive last 30 minutes.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_01
 I'll be taking minutes on this one and being hooked up to the PowerPoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself because it'll be more about what you guys are bringing to the meeting today.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_01
 The first presentation we'll be looking at is Poppy's presentation.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_01
 So, take it away Poppy.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_00
 It's plugged in.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry about this guy.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_00
 I'll take this time just to apologize.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_00
 I'm only seeing my emails later on because I was too busy carrying away doing my own thing, which is not obviously not a very good part of a team working thing, but there we go from Shurds.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_00
 I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design and what we actually need to do and what the remote control needs to do.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_00
 It needs to allow a person to have a portable device so they can control the television from wherever they are.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_00
 They don't need to actually manually touch the television set.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_00
 So it gives them much more flexibility and allows them to view where they want to be.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_00
 From on the functional side of things, we found out from a previous meeting what we decided at certain points will make our project unique.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_00
 One is the visibility in the dark, which was Genevieve's idea.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_00
 So we need to think about how we could bring this in technically and we could use illuminated buttons, which we're all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone or something familiar.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_00
 It also massively lights up at first touch.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_00
 Or we could use fluorescent materials, which would just take in the light during the day and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_00
 Also we could use an alarm.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_00
 So if we lost the remote control, perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself which you could press.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_00
 And then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was hopefully in the room.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe behind a cushion or somewhere.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_00
 That would work.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_00
 Go back there.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_00
 Another thing I think we missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_00
 From previous researchers that have carried out another project.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_00
 We've learned about smart materials where specific alloys of metals have a shape memory so they can be heated and cooled and they change the shape of the metal.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_00
 So for example a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_00
 So the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life if it was heated everything would spring apart.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_00
 All the individual components could be easily separated and then some could be reused, some could be recycled and I think that would be very important for products now.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_00
 Especially because there's so much responsibility for all the companies who are coming up with new designs because we all know that our results have been limited and they have to be very environmentally conscious.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_01
 One question.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_01
 This self destructible metal it allows for recycling materials so that someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it and then once they contributed then that company can break down the parts better.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah they would you would make the product as you normally would apart from the bits that hold it all together would be made out of the shape memory alloy and that's the part that would allow all the other parts to be separated at the end.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_00
 I mean the user would return the product to the company because it's a product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made and then the company could then make use of this shape memory alloys to split up the components and then either reuse some bits and add bits which are obviously going to wear out with time or not useable they might be able to put into scrap metal or something like the case if it scratched or something you wouldn't want to reuse it but you might be able to melt it down and use it again somewhere else.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_01
 Would we be the company that would break down these metals or would we...

0:06:21	SPEAKER_00
 We could probably employ a side company or something to do that for us but it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made for certain percentage at least.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_00
 No, not 100% of anything we could do.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_01
 This sounds like a really great idea.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_01
 One thing we have to consider is our 100% turnover goal that we have for our financial sector so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us, cost the company because it sounds very labor intensive we have to hire a number of people and it might be more expensive.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_00
 Well the fact of the shape memory alloys is that they don't need to be manually constructed like you don't have to individually unscrew all the screws because of this property, the smart material all you need is just the heat so they self-destruct themselves.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_00
 All right, let's have to investigate the financial implications.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_01
 I like the environmental approach.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_01
 We'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_00
 Also, there's some components that will be how it will actually work but I haven't put this plan together yet.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sorry, can you, sorry should I go back?

0:07:49	SPEAKER_00
 This would actually show the circuit diagram although I haven't come back to the final circuit yet.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so I just don't would put all those components in.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_01
 So those are what will construct the remote?

0:08:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it just shows what sort of energy source it could be, a battery, like rechargeable probably.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_00
 So how the infrared will actually be sent to the city by the chip on television site.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_00
 All right, great, okay.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_00
 So now is it F8 again?

0:08:23	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, all right, thank you very much.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_01
 And the next presenter will be Tara.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_02
 Is it F8?

0:09:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_02
 I'm the user interface designer.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_02
 The technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus you have.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_02
 In this case, it's the function of remote control, which is just a message to the television site.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_02
 By taking inspiration from other similar designs, you'll try and come up with an original trend of remote control, which is the elbow international.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_02
 There are two functional design options, a multifunctional remote control, which can be used for several entertainment devices, and a single function remote control used specifically for the television.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_02
 So it was a lot of multifunctional and site.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_02
 I think the function just the television, which is well.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I see.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_02
 Multifunction controls can be difficult to use as the notes and buttons can be confusing.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_02
 A single function remote control is simpler to use, but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_02
 I think that a single function remote control would be preferable because it's easier to use.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_02
 It'd be more compatible with the range of television sets, making it more internationally available.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_02
 It would make an original design more attainable as the less functional necessities to include a new design, and it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic and less functions would have to be included.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_02
 So it would be cheaper to make.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_02
 I'm probably more scalable just because it's more compatible with a wider range of devices.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_02
 Does anyone have any questions?

0:11:58	SPEAKER_03
 So as far as we know, a single function television remote control is usable internationally.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it's just that when we're creating it, we have to make it compatible with different brands, devices.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_02
 And it would be easier to make it compatible with different brands, different devices rather than all you can do is use it.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_01
 Does everyone agree with this? Does anyone object and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go?

0:12:35	SPEAKER_00
 I was just thinking about what Jenna said before about having some hidden controls, having the outer casing.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_00
 What you said before about being a profitable simplistic design, if having that would complicate it a lot more.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_00
 The limit of design.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_03
 I think I agree with the single design thing now because we're trying to do so much that if we're trying to make a unique user friendly, that's also multifunctional.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_03
 We're going to go over budget.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_02
 And with this, we'll have more women in the budget probably to make a more legitimate design.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_02
 We'll have more money to go on to the design side of it.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_01
 Sounds great. All right. Well, are you ready for your presentation?

0:13:30	SPEAKER_03
 Jenna? Yes, I am.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_01
 Badness.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_01
 Except you're not hooked up to the.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_03
 Completely ready.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_02
 Great.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, I just lost my microphone.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_03
 And I'll give you a little briefing of what that means exactly.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_03
 I feel remember from the email we got before our very first kickoff meeting with the coffee machine.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_03
 The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_03
 So what I'll be talking about now is the equivalent for remote control.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_03
 So basically what needs and desires her to be fulfilled.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_03
 I've done some marketing research, a lot of interviews with remote control users and some internet research.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_03
 I'll show you my findings.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, and firstly, I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_03
 So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_03
 Hence our motto, we put the fashion and electronics.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_03
 So I think that should be our priority here.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_03
 And we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design, not just in electronic fashion so that it's something that fits in the household.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_01
 What was that last thing that you just said?

0:15:14	SPEAKER_03
 We should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_03
 Any trends that are going on in the public, even media, you know, who's famous, what TV shows are being watched to influence our remote control.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so the findings.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_03
 75% of users of remote controls find them ugly, which is quite a significant number.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_03
 The other 25% didn't specify if they love them or found them, you know, neutral.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_03
 80% of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_03
 Current remote controls do not match well the operating behavior of the user.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry, the 80% of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy, you mean that they would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control?

0:15:56	SPEAKER_03
 They're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality, as opposed to your basic, you know, oval, black, all same size button remote control.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_03
 So it is something that people care about.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_03
 It's not ignored in the household.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_03
 75% of remote control users said that they zap a lot, zapping meaning they go through channels a lot, you know, thumbmasters.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_03
 And 50% of users say they only use 10% of the buttons.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_03
 That very small amount.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_03
 That was interesting.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_01
 So it might be very appealing if we have very concise buttons.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_01
 And another thing with lots of surfing, we probably have to work on something that could be a lot more durable because I find with channel changes that a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_03
 And actually to go with that, I'm going to give you some statistics on the relevancy of each of the buttons, how much they're used, and how important the users find them.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_03
 So the power button, obviously in an hour, is only used once.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_03
 Hopefully the person is not turning on and off the TV.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_03
 But the relevance of that button is 9 out of 10.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_03
 So people want to be able to turn on the TV with the remote control, as opposed to signing up and turning on the television set.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_03
 Channel selection is used 168 times on average per hour. That's a huge amount. This is the most important button.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_03
 So obviously when commercials come on, they're changing it.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_03
 So as you said, we want a durable button that's not going to run down.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_03
 Relevance of that button, our users found, was 10 out of 10.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_03
 Ditto for volume selection, it's a 10 out of 10.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_03
 And it's used on average four times an hour.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_03
 Not as much as channel selection, but still significant.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_03
 Audio settings is used on average 0.8 times an hour.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_03
 And relevance is 2. Screen settings, which means brightness, color, et cetera.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_03
 0.5 times an hour. And relevance of 1.5. We're getting to specific statistics here.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_03
 Teletext. Now I'm not too clear on what that is. I don't know if you can help me flipping pages.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_02
 It has TV, has like information has information on holidays, news, entertainment.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_01
 So like a running banner? No, it's a button that you press and then you, like a menu pops up.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_02
 I haven't used it before, but... And you have page numbers like for the menu and you press the page numbers with your remote change.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. Very basic internet. Very basic internet.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. But you know... Like tells you the weather and... Yeah, but you have no interaction back with it.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_02
 You know, like internet content emails. Yeah.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_00
 Right. You know, information that I'm like television time data is what's on now from that from every time.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. Alright. Well, I guess I'm not with it because I wasn't, but it's being used 14 times an hour.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_03
 And has a high relevance in 6.5. So it looks like something that we're going to want to do some research on and include on our remote control.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_03
 Channel settings. 0.01 times an hour. Relevance of three. Channel settings.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_02
 Probably just tuning in the channels.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_02
 Are you sorry, changing channels?

0:18:58	SPEAKER_02
 Chilling in the menu. Sorry, you know, getting YouTube is that you tuning in the channels.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, okay.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. Yeah.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. Okay.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_03
 So it's not used very often, but people still find it relevant.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_03
 Biggest frustrations of the people that we interviewed, remote controls are often lost somewhere.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_03
 So that was already discussed by Poppy, how we can have an alarm system so that people can find it.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_03
 It takes too much time to learn how to use a remote control.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_03
 So it should be very user friendly, you know, people know what to do very quickly.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_03
 Remote controls are bad for RSI.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_03
 That's rather sad.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe our designers can look into that.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_03
 Buttons that don't require, you know, very firm pushing if they respond.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_03
 But we'll have to also avoid buttons responding to the slightest touch as well.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_03
 That's a problem.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. Did you guys get that one down?

0:20:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. Here's some ideas for you.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_03
 A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_03
 So I'll show you some numbers here.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_03
 So the youngest age group, 15 to 25, 91.2% said that they would pay extra money to have voice recognition included on the remote control.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_03
 You can see that number decreases a bit.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_03
 Interestingly enough, 25 to 35 is the lowest amount that we are willing to pay extra.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_03
 So I guess we're going to have to figure out what age group we're targeting and if voice recognition is something we want to look into.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_03
 And if we have the budget for it.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_03
 If we are targeting young adults, it looks like something that would pay off.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_03
 Seeing as 90% over 90% would pay for it.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_01
 I agree with if we're targeting young adults, then it would be something we should look into financially and functionally.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 And especially if we are trying to be trendy, go with fashions, things like that.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_01
 And if we have a lot of people who are not interested in the same age as from 35 to 65, which show the lower numbers, probably won't be as concerned.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_03
 So that's a whole other field of research.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if you'd still have a remote or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_03
 Depending on how many members you have in a household.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_01
 So it may be too complicated for us.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_01
 But it's something to keep in mind anyway.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_01
 And something that might further complicate it is that the TV makes noise itself.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_00
 And then we have the phone time.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_00
 And so it's panning to me when you're watching television.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_00
 But yeah.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_00
 It's very difficult to get specific.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_01
 If we're looking for simplistic design, if we need to decide if that is our intention is a simplistic design.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_01
 Because if it is, then I think voice activated.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_01
 It looks like.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_01
 And that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing because if people can activate the television with their voice and they won't be using it.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_01
 They won't be talking into remote.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_03
 I'm sure.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_03
 And the last thing here was an LCD screen.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_03
 So I mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_03
 Not practical.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_03
 An LCD screen though might be something that you know, you can shift through pages kind of the way this PowerPoint is working.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_03
 So that you don't have so many buttons to deal with.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know what an LCD screen is.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_03
 Oh sorry.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_03
 Just a screen like a computer screen.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_03
 Or like a little bit.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_03
 Like an alarm clock.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_03
 You'd have an LCD versus just a.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_00
 I have no idea.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_03
 Oh just like an electronic screen as opposed to just buttons.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_03
 There'd be like a little.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, on the remote.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_03
 Like on the top of the cell phone.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_03
 No, I don't know what exactly we put on there. I guess the channel that you're on volume setting.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_02
 Could it be good if it had the actual program that was on the what was next?

0:23:03	SPEAKER_02
 But that would probably be like LinkedIn.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_02
 That would be good.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_00
 That would be better.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_00
 Access that to you.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_02
 It might be quite expensive to do that.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_03
 I guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_03
 And finally, whoops.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_03
 My personal preferences and thoughts.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_03
 I think our priority really should be unique design.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_03
 We want something that people want in their home.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_03
 Every remote control looks the same.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_03
 So in my opinion, it should be user friendly and unique.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_03
 So the other stuff might be a little too gagedy for some people.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_03
 My self voice recognition kind of scares me off.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_03
 So if we're aiming to make this an international university universally accepted product.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_03
 And for all, the other thing is age market.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, if we wanted to concentrate on 50 to 25 year olds, we could go with the fancy stuff.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_03
 But if we want to make 50 million and have everyone want this remote control, we should maybe stick to the basics.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_02
 I wish I could keep in mind that 15 to 25 year olds might not have 25 year olds to stand in a remote control.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_02
 Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control, then they're just starting to like me.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_03
 And we had to keep in mind the reliability of our research.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, you know, a 16 year old boy would say, yeah, I'd pay a temporary second next to them.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_03
 And they realized that's three months allowance.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_03
 So I think the older generations, we should be catering to a bit more early 20s.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_01
 And if one of the largest or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use remote control.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sure that something like an LCD screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_03
 That's it for the market research.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_01
 Before we go into more discussion on we want this design to look like I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_01
 For one thing, because having controls with DVD, VCR, that sort of thing would really complicate the design of the remote control.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_01
 We've decided not to include them and make it a specific, just a specific television function, which is good as as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_01
 For many reasons.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_01
 So we have that decision sort of made for us.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_01
 Another thing that might affect other decisions is that the management feels that teletext is outdated because more people are using the internet now.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_01
 And so we won't concern ourselves with navigating the teletext option.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_00
 Can I just enter?

0:26:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yep.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can go on the PowerPoint?

0:26:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I do.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_01
 I'm looking at it right now.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_01
 There you go.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, come back, Spring.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_00
 With the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext or just avoiding both altogether.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I mean, we don't have the resources or possibility of using the internet with the remote control, but they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_01
 Right. And another thing this is for the design, the design of the product is that we want to create more of a sense that people know that this is from our company.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_01
 So all the remote controls must have our will incorporate our logo and color in some way.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_01
 So perhaps our logo on the bottom or wherever you feel like it would look good.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_01
 It would have to be the color of our company.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_01
 But another thing is that we probably would have to have that color and logo decided upon.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_01
 I'm assuming that we already have one, but for the purposes of this meeting, I wasn't offered a type of logo or color.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_01
 So if that could be somewhere on the design, so we can be recognizable.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_01
 The little are our yellow thing.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_01
 Real reaction.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yes. Those are the changes.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_01
 So now we need to discuss.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_01
 And come to a decision on our remote control functions of how this is going to be.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just going to look at my notes for a second.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_01
 We have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_01
 So we already know that it'll just be for the television.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_01
 It won't have teletext, but we can discuss those other options that you brought up, Genevieve.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_03
 So are we going to write off the LCD option?

0:28:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_01
 Is that how most people feel about that?

0:28:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_03
 No teletext and no voice recognition.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_02
 I think it would be annoying.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_02
 I don't use teletext that much, but if it was on your team, you'd want to be able to use it.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_01
 But another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd, I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext, so it would be really superfluous.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know about other countries besides the UK.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_01
 Do you know if anywhere else?

0:29:13	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_00
 How's it?

0:29:15	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's more recent.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_00
 It was a management decision that we have.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_00
 It was a management decision.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_01
 So it's pretty much out of our hands at this point.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_01
 So I guess we're looking at something rather simple.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I guess just from my findings, it looks like we want to minimize buttons.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_03
 And what was the word that you used?

0:29:43	SPEAKER_03
 Findability is important.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what it is.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had, because I'm sure that could be inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_01
 The same signal.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_01
 The same signal through that nica just like a little beeping noise.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_01
 It's not that expensive to do.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_00
 Just the same as a mobile phone.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_02
 I like that idea.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to put the little device in here.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_02
 As an other not control for all two years.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_00
 If you're doing the link between the buttons.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_00
 The buttons are actually on.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_01
 So I know.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_01
 My computer there.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_02
 It's like an all-j

0:30:39	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure if I'm going to use the back of any set that would be not very obtrusive. Obviously something small.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_00
 That's good.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_01
 Then it wouldn't it probably wouldn't be able to use it would be able to use the same reception on the remote control, I guess, but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signal.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_01
 Would it need a back to then?

0:31:00	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe.

0:31:01	None
 Probably.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, that's your department.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_00
 Sort that out.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_00
 Unless some way it could have some universal connection to like the socket, the same socket that the TV's supplied from.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, the power for the TV.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_00
 You have to invest that one.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_01
 Do some research on that.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_01
 Great.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_01
 And I'm sure that the glow in the dark fluorescent, whatever system.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_01
 It's a go ahead.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_01
 Does everyone interested in that?

0:31:40	SPEAKER_02
 I like the light up suggestion.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_02
 Because you're like white.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't, it could be a tactile thing as well.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_03
 If we're minimizing buttons, we might be able to make them actually larger and there's something on it.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_03
 Like a raised up arrow down arrow for volume.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_03
 And I don't know what we could do for channels.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_02
 Which is the numbers could be embossed.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_02
 Could be like raised.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_02
 The numbers themselves.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_02
 The 90s.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_03
 Like up button and down button for the channel.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_03
 Channel changing.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_03
 Just like a lot.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_03
 It just, it might be sucking more battery power if there, if it is a light up.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_00
 And also, uh, having you mentioned before, um, like how it should be accessible to everybody.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_00
 And so like big, um, buttons made before people who are visually impaired, glow in the dark or light up, won't make any difference anyway.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_00
 So like you said, tactile might be better because it'd be more available to everybody.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_01
 Could we somehow, we could maybe possibly, sorry, incorporate them both so that.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_01
 The buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some sort of glow in the dark material.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_01
 So I don't think that little dark material, um, like the actual soft plastic, um, costs that much more than other colors.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_00
 Not these days and it's quite.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_03
 I guess the other option referring to the battery thing is, you know how cell phones will light up for 15 seconds.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_03
 And then it goes.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_03
 So if you're like changing the volume during a movie, I'm thinking of most of you watching a movie, turn all the lights off, right?

0:33:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_03
 You don't turn on the lights to turn it down because of suddenly an explosion.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_03
 It's going to wake up the baby.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_03
 So if you touch the button, it kind of reactivates it.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_00
 It's a self-tiler.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_00
 It's a self-tiler.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_01
 We have five minutes left, um, for the meeting, but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_01
 Um, what was, I missed the last moment reading that.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_01
 What were you talking about with the lighting up?

0:33:52	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, just if it was kind of the same way that a cell, you know, a cell phone will light up for 10, 15 seconds when you touch a button after having not touched it for a while.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_03
 Um, if instead of a constant light up on the, on the remote control, if it lights up for 10 seconds when it's touched again.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_01
 So it could be any button that would be pressed?

0:34:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_03
 You just, and it just kind of lights up a bit and it gives a thing glow.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_01
 So if you have all the lights off in your living room, you'll, you'll temporarily see it because you're getting the glow in the dark thing and the shape of the numbers.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_01
 You have to kind of decide what we're going to do with this.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_00
 I think the shape of the numbers is really a good idea.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_00
 And I think that's unique as well.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, I haven't seen that.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_00
 And as you're saying, like numbers can wear off if they're just, yeah.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we have those.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_01
 If it's that softer rubber material, it'll be, um, uh, better for people with else.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_01
 No one's a cold RSI.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_01
 What was it though?

0:34:49	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's, it's, okay.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_01
 Um, did we want to go for the glow in the dark look or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly?

0:35:02	SPEAKER_01
 Should we do both or we can have one or the other because it might, for, for design purposes, I mean, the lighting up thing might be better because glow in the dark material has a funny kind of color and it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_03
 Exactly.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_03
 It might be perceived as tacky, glow in the dark.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_03
 It's kind of like 80s neon style.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we could be trending fashion also.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, there are now loads of a huge range of different colours that you could light up in as well, which could glink in with the company colours, blue or green or yellow.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_00
 And like, we're just limited with the...

0:35:35	SPEAKER_00
 Just...

0:35:36	SPEAKER_01
 Alright, so we've just started unlighting up.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_02
 I was thinking of what was going on with the dark cupid, the real reaction symbol as going on the dark, and then it was a big compliment, right?

0:35:47	SPEAKER_02
 Avertise?

0:35:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_00
 And I'm the...is it lit up?

0:35:52	SPEAKER_00
 That could light up as well.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, oh.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_01
 But with the same thing, I mean, if you touch the button and then it could be lit up as well, is...

0:36:02	SPEAKER_01
 Are you okay with that?

0:36:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, cool.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_01
 Alright, so I think that completes most of our more practical decisions, and now it's up to designing, and making sure that this can be feasible.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_01
 And do you have any...

0:36:21	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, sorry.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_01
 Do you have anything to say?

0:36:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, I'm just going to throw out there the thought about personalizing the remote control.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_03
 Because you mentioned faceplates.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_03
 So I don't know if there's something that...

0:36:34	SPEAKER_03
 You know, like five different faceplates.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if this would start making it more complicated, but it could increase the popularity of the remote.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, like you can have changeable mobile Kevin's iPad or something.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_01
 Exactly.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_01
 Or like mobile.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_01
 Like a cell phone, yeah.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_03
 And I don't know if you'd want to go with TV show themes or something, like a Bart Simpson faceplate.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_02
 And then that would be more profitable, like as a side line to the remote control.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_03
 So, so you could start out with three, and if we hit it big, then we can add some more.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, last good.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_01
 Great.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think that we should incorporate that into changeable.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_01
 Because that wouldn't be very expensive at all.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_01
 You just get one mold.

0:37:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:37:12	SPEAKER_01
 Throw some plastic in it, you know.

0:37:15	SPEAKER_00
 And also possible, I mean, we could gain out of that by advertising certain TV shows.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_01
 That might be problematic with copyright issues.

0:37:27	SPEAKER_00
 So if we...

0:37:28	SPEAKER_00
 It takes off, then we'll try that out.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_00
 The environmental factor, we didn't bring that up again.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:37:36	SPEAKER_01
 We'll have to do more research.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_01
 Like as of yet, that has nothing to do with the way to look.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_01
 Because we need to investigate the financial implications.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_01
 Does it need to be decided on now?

0:37:55	SPEAKER_00
 I think we can probably leave that till later.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_01
 Good.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_01
 All right, then.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_01
 Anyone else have anything more to say before we close?

0:38:03	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:38:05	SPEAKER_01
 Well, let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later.

0:38:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:38:10	None
 All right.

0:38:11	None
 All right.

0:38:12	None
 All right.

0:38:13	None
 All right.

0:38:14	None
 All right.
