0:00:00	None
 Help.

0:00:02	None
 Help.

0:00:08	SPEAKER_01
 Is that fair?

0:00:09	SPEAKER_01
 Um, let's raise that.

0:00:11	None
 I'm just going to just...

0:00:27	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no, really too hard.

0:00:29	None
 I'm going to look at you.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to look at you.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_02
 Right, okay.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_01
 Um, right, I agenda for today.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_01
 Do you want us to be sent?

0:01:20	SPEAKER_02
 No, that's okay, so...

0:01:22	SPEAKER_01
 Um, I'll go over what we decided last, you say?

0:01:29	SPEAKER_01
 Um, we decided upon a universal control, one hand set for all to be prepared.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_01
 Um, that it was important that the product that built a wide range of consumers, wide age range, not limited to anyone, was then it was important to affect the company's image and aspect of the fashion and electronics, and the fact that it was thing.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_01
 Um, our budget would have to affect, um, try not to affect our budget, um, that we might have a bit of...

0:02:11	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I'm just a bit.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_01
 I think.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_01
 Um, dissonance between what our budget was and what we wanted to look like.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_01
 Um, wanted to look unflattered, undonted, so that's where we discussed a flip over design, um, we're just in the size control and an electronic panel, um, the further features that we're programming, things like that.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_01
 Um, three presentations.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_01
 I got right here, so, should we give them my screen face?

0:02:51	SPEAKER_02
 Um, is it okay if I just want that to later, I just want to get access to a little bit more information.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, yeah, I'll go first.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_03
 Can I grab the...

0:02:59	SPEAKER_01
 Like me?

0:03:01	SPEAKER_03
 Thanks.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_03
 What does press OFA?

0:03:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, this is the working design presented by me, the industrial design extrudeness.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint, so.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_03
 What, the first thing question I asked was, what are we trying to design?

0:03:49	SPEAKER_03
 Well, a device which basically just sends the signal to the TV to change its say, whether that be the power or the channel.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_03
 Um, or the volume, everything is just, um, some sort of signal to change the state of the TV or other appliances, sending the signal to.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_03
 Um, so I decided I'd have a look at what other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_03
 But although we will want to be taking ideas from other people, we want to make sure that our design stands out.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_03
 And I thought that was something that, well, it wasn't really my area because I'm dealing with the inside, really.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I ran out of time, so I can do this one as fun as the last time.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_03
 Um, and I found out that most controls use some form of infrared sent signals to the TV presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that can be used wireless.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_03
 And you don't need to send very much information.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_03
 And most of them are powered by some form of battery. Now, I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A batteries, but those can be quite bulky.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_03
 So I didn't know if you want to look at something else so could shrink down the size.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_02
 Can I interject to ask a question?

0:05:22	SPEAKER_03
 Are you saying that triple A batteries are small or the current? If you look at most remote controls, they're quite chunky.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_03
 And that's because of the size of the batteries. They have to be obviously this size to fit those batteries.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_03
 Triple A is the smallest you can get.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you can get the sort of circular round ones, but I'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_03
 And which leads to the next point about being small and easy to carry around.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_03
 Now the ones are small, but I was just wondering if we can lift it something a bit smaller.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_03
 Now the main components I came up with were obviously the power source for the batteries because otherwise it's not going to work.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_03
 As I said about the which batteries we were going to choose, we can discuss that later. And then obviously you need something to decode the information that you're putting in from the controller and to turn it into an infrared signal, which we're going to use to send the information.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_03
 Now these have a wireless range up to about five meters, which is so suitable for anyone who's watching their TV unless they're in a cinema, which not most people do say as we're fine for the most audience that should be fine.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_03
 And then I was just had a quick look at the external design, but I left that mostly to the interface designer.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_03
 And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we want to do. It's not a proper circuit.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure if it will work or not. I'm not even confident with those, the real way you'd wire up. But anyway, we've just got the power going to the infrared bulb, the chip and the UI interface, which would basically when you when you pressed anything, it would the chip would convert it into some form of our data, which could be decoded by the TV receiver, which obviously means that we're going to have to conform to whatever, whatever form of communication that the TVs are already using. And since that's another reason to use infrared, because that's what all TVs are doing.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_03
 And then finally, we want the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost. So all the components that I've put forward are low in cost. So that should be good.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_03
 It should should be different enough from the alternative products to get good consumer base.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_03
 We're talking about it for and also just something that I was thinking about because they're small, they're also easy to lose. So if we could look into some way of, you know, some anti going down the side of the sofa, that's the very important point that came up in our market research findings too. So I can refer to that.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_01
 That's what I came up with there.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_00
 Just to put it.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_00
 So function.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_00
 So So that's what I wanted to do.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_00
 So people have used remote control for say a year or something and they are not used maybe 32 to 40% of the burdens. So it's not of no use of punching in those trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse a user.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to make a profit also so we can maybe go for an economy of a higher production by 50 million.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 So if you ask me personally, I would make a flip top with the 20 design and maybe we should look at also like the buttons where they are like soft or little hard because the buttons tend to be a bit hard.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_00
 So overall simple and user friendly design. Any comments?

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 I think we'll chat about it at the end.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_02
 So I'm going to keep this here.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_02
 So I'm going to put it a bit more.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_02
 So I'm going to put it right over.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view. And obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_02
 So that's where we started. We used our usability lab, the company's usability lab. We did our usual selection methods to get across section of the general public mail and female all age groups from 15 upwards.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_02
 So we observed them in the lab. Just their general use of the remote control. You can see we had 100 subjects there.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_02
 Our findings, lots of findings. I've just summarized some of them here. The overall thing which I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote control.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_02
 So that has obvious design implications there. We found it's 75% of users find most remote controls ugly.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_02
 So 80% would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. We were quite surprised by that finding.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_02
 But that's quite a high proportion of our international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_02
 Current remote controls do not match well with the operating behavior of the user overall.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_02
 For example, you can see, although they're 75% of users zap a lot. So you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel hopping. So again, there's power implications there.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_02
 50% of users only use 10% of the buttons. So again, a big design issue there. And possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_02
 The biggest frustrations that people find with regard to personal preferences were something that you mentioned earlier.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_02
 Remote controls are often lost in the room. It's slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_02
 50% were particularly frustrated by that.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_02
 34% of people take too much time to learn to use. And I think that ties in with the previous finding of people only using 10% of the buttons.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_02
 They just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_02
 Slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_02
 There's small movements so the remote control can lead to shoulder and elbow problems.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_02
 The vast majority of the 35 and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_02
 Again, that was to aid, I think, when they've lost the actual remote control, some kind of speech recognition.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_02
 Something we didn't put to them, which I'm thinking of now, is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again until you find it or are flashing light.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_02
 Possibly. That trend reverses in the older age groups.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_02
 So 35 and under who would like those two features, that kind of evens out 35 to 45 and in the older age group it reverses and not supported with this.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_02
 I had marvelous tables and things that I could show you but I think I'll just keep it simple.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_02
 If there's any more information I can email you extra details, is that okay?

0:17:18	SPEAKER_01
 Right, we have new project requirements.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_01
 We're not going to be using teletext, but we're currently consumers, consider outdated with the internet now.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_01
 Our control is only going to be for TV, it's not going to be a combined control, which limits all of the different things.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_01
 It limits the cost for us, it also makes it easier to understand both.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_02
 So can we not program a video with this remote control?

0:18:00	SPEAKER_01
 There's for TV only, so it looks like it.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_01
 Just channel-hospins?

0:18:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think maybe sky, things like that might be incorporated into it, but I don't know what do you think it just said for TV only?

0:18:17	SPEAKER_01
 Would that imply video use and controls?

0:18:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_01
 You do video as well.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know, because if you get combined TV only with this thing.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_03
 If you've got a sky box, one of those sky plus boxes, now you can record straight off TV anyway, say, on TV hard drive or something.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_01
 I think we have seen it still go slow and start searching.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_00
 Anything about that on the market research or something regarding whether people want to combine something like that?

0:18:54	SPEAKER_02
 We didn't really look into that, but remember we found that finding that most people only use about 10% of the buttons.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_02
 I think that those did tend to be the basic channel-hopping things on and off for the video, fast forwarding, so on.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 And I think it's a general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a night.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_02
 So I don't know if that's something we need to...

0:19:16	SPEAKER_03
 It's just an idea on the speech recognition thing. It would probably be quite expensive to incorporate it into our speech recognition thing.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_03
 And they're not that great.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_02
 In fact, I've just called up that table there.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_02
 We asked those two questions. The table relates to both questions, so we didn't differentiate.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_02
 Would you prefer an LCD screen that's multi-function remote and would you pay more of the speech recognition in remote control?

0:19:39	SPEAKER_02
 So you can see how the yes, no, sort of varies across the age group there. A substantial number of don't know the older age group.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's just general fear of new technology.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_03
 But on that again, I just thought, because you can get those key chains now and you whistle, and then it'll allow for loud noise to let you know where it is.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_03
 So I thought that could be for you.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_01
 We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves. So I think when we can take a cheaper option, which still does the same kind of thing.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_01
 Because it is something...

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 It needs to be the thing that you used to find it needs to be something that you don't lose.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_01
 You're just whistling.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe on the TV you could put like a pack on the TV or something so you can't see the remote. You go and press the button on top of the TV and it beeps.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_01
 It's everything.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_01
 It's super easy to do that, but that sounds a lot too good.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_01
 The third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the hand set.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_01
 So we want logo, we want fashionable trendy.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, what you're talking about with the marketing.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 People paying more for it to loot, good.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_01
 We need to focus on that.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so further market research will be needed to focus on what that is.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_02
 It's going to be different for a 15-year-old for somebody who's 60.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_02
 And also across the world of the international market, what is attractive to a trending New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African?

0:21:23	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_02
 You get the idea.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_02
 It's going to vary around the world.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_02
 At the end of the day, the engineering design is one thing.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_02
 It's the user interface design that may, and the sort of fashionable aspect of it, we might have to change the different markets around the world.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_00
 So are we talking about a single model of maybe a six design?

0:21:46	SPEAKER_03
 Well, yeah, you could have a number of different designs.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, inside that, that would be essentially exactly the same.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_00
 We just could be same in the body, but the looks are different.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_01
 What about, we were talking about the buttons.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_01
 The controls that are coming out now have kind of big rubber buttons, not tiny little, big rubber buttons.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_01
 But what about, I mean, because we've got to make it original.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_01
 What about, you know, with the touch screen?

0:22:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah, that's what I was just...

0:22:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah?

0:22:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_01
 So it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button, which shouldn't wear out as much.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I know, because you wouldn't have to.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_01
 You don't have to press it, you just have to put your thumb onto it.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_01
 I think that might appeal to kind of Japan, thinking young, office people trendy.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_01
 It would appeal to sections of the market, but quite easily labeled so that anyone can...

0:22:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's obvious what that's for, and it's not daunting to maybe the older generation.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_03
 Well, say ergonomics, as we're saying with the different designs, ergonomics.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_03
 There's sort of physically different things, because if you've ever seen the Xbox, they had to make two different sized controllers, because people in Japan wouldn't buy it, because the controller was physically too big, because...

0:23:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, they cut just generally Japanese people have smaller hands, so they can get around the controller, which is...

0:23:35	SPEAKER_03
 So if you...

0:23:37	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what, because obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something, then smaller ones for others.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe to...

0:23:47	SPEAKER_00
 It was indicated that the risk of a repeated use, the injuries, maybe your touch screen could be a better option for that.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_00
 So, you're dividing designs, not only segment, age groups, you're dividing it according to the countries also, the market.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe for US and all, you can have a slightly bigger remote.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_00
 And maybe in Japan, I know you need to have a small...

0:24:13	SPEAKER_01
 I think we have to design one product, and then the company can take it wherever they want to, in the sense that they can make it smaller, or they can make it bigger, or they can change features slightly.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_02
 The internal engineering design has got to remain the same.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_01
 It's going to be the same, so we need to focus on just one thing, you can't get bogged down in lots of different possibilities.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_02
 I'm concerned when you read the RSI issue, again, a competitive strain injury, I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that, I think that is still a kind of question mark, it's you how we deal with that.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_02
 RSI tends to be caused by repetitive small movements.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_02
 I really can't get my head around this one, it's me who have to be postponed to a future meeting, but it's something we should think about.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_03
 I was just thinking about how you combat that, because without doing something where you have to move your arms.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_03
 I know, and it becomes ridiculous.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_01
 On speech recognition.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_01
 Which is extremely exciting.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's the only way that you can avoid that kind of issue.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_02
 Do we have to initially, looking at the findings here, focus on a younger age group initially, and then broaden out the market later?

0:25:34	SPEAKER_02
 Do we really have to go for everyone right away?

0:25:38	SPEAKER_00
 We're focusing on the biggest market.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_02
 We've been throwing up our ideas, we're automatically talking about business people, young people, 20 people.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_01
 We are retarded by the type of company that we're working for as well, that they want it to be fashionable, they want it to be trendy, and you wouldn't automatically assume, associate that with older generation.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_01
 Now, with the baby boomers, the older generation, they're actually larger than the older generation, than us young people.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't think we're focusing on that.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_01
 I think we are focusing on a mid-range business kind of class.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_02
 I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too, but when it does get to the broad scale marketing stage, we want to not waste money, not be profligate.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_02
 And in a focus on where the idea will be taken up, it's much likely to be taken up, where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so the remote control functions, we've got the TV, we've got the video, now there's, I can't remember what it's called, the little code at the end of program details.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_01
 Video plus.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_01
 We could use that as an alternative to programming in times, things like that.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_01
 I always found that really easy when I discovered it, because you've got your general record anyway, there's a program on you want to put the code on, that's fine.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_01
 But if you do want to tape something in your day time, you're not sure if you're going to, you put the number in, and it's just a number, it's not a date, it's not time, it's not a channel, it's not when it finishes, it's not.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_03
 Anything like that, it's just a number.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_03
 And you wouldn't need a whole host of extra buttons for that, you just need work, because you've already got the number.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_02
 You've got to have your numbers in your hands.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not kind of gross that function, but it sounds wonderful.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_01
 It is after, if you look in the new safer TV guide or any TV guide, there's a six digit number afterwards, and that's number you put in.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_01
 And it's recorded, but it's going to be on on Tuesday, but 10 o'clock on the 17th, things like that, so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_01
 And it has been around.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_03
 It's been around for a long time, it's just, it's not very well advertised.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's not.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_01
 I think if awareness was kind of much before, fun about that.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_03
 So if you've got something like sky anyway, you can just click on it, you can just press the button on the program.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_03
 Once in it, we're called that program.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_03
 When it's on, you press it on it twice, and it will go the whole series.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_03
 Excellent.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_03
 So that, yeah.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_03
 But just have that function, it'd be really good.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so, can I just run this past you while it occurs to me?

0:28:45	SPEAKER_02
 I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another, but just discussing the different age groups and targeting with different age groups.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_02
 It occurs to me, I'd already produced there on mobile phones, that's kind of what led us on to comparing TV and mobile controls with their design features.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_02
 Chain companies like Carphone Warehouse, you can pop in any time with a phone that you've bought for them, if you've got any problems with it, and they'll fix it with the company, you can use their telephones.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_02
 Is it worthwhile with our retail outlets?

0:29:14	SPEAKER_02
 Having a similar kind of service.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_02
 So that if all the users were deterred from buying this, if they know they can just pop in to one of our high-street outlets, which button is that I press for this?

0:29:25	SPEAKER_02
 That's a free aspect of our service.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_02
 But that'll not make it more attractive to them.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_03
 But the only problem is that with a mobile phone, you sign for a contract.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_03
 So they, the companies who, who you deal with, have actually, they've got an obligation to help you out, and also, I mean, it's fair enough that I have some sort of help service, but I'm not sure how much the cost would be.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_01
 The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there, you're pressing the button, your TV's not doing it.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_01
 Taking your TV and your phone, you're saying, look, this is what I'm doing.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_01
 It's not what I'm doing.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_02
 If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_02
 But I mean, for if there were any more or absolutely definite on the going to be for TV and video.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, just a thought.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, instruction books.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_03
 I feel like it's really good.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_01
 So I mean, there's customer service.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_01
 There will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_01
 And that way there's no call out charge.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_01
 There's no extra person who has to walk to a shop in the high street.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_00
 I think I heard too much of an upward photo.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_00
 For a phone, maybe he might walk down this street, but for a remote, he will just look at the light.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_02
 Not for such simple functions because we're focusing on that.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_01
 We should focus on making manuals.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_01
 It's user-friendly as possible because a lot of them are just trying that writing a lot and lots of pages.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's people of reading them, so they just do the obvious.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_01
 They just throw into the sun and go as wrong and then you try and touch through it.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_01
 That should be something that they can write.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_01
 What other functions we need?

0:31:04	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if we need a design decision now, but we should think about...

0:31:12	SPEAKER_01
 Because you've got the dilemma between old battery, that's what I was thinking about.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_01
 What about fun batteries?

0:31:18	SPEAKER_01
 What kind of battery is that?

0:31:20	SPEAKER_03
 They're especially made for the mobile phones.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_03
 But they come with a charger.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, you could bundle a charger.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_01
 They've been last quite a long time.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_01
 And if you had...

0:31:34	SPEAKER_01
 When you've been seeing that you get with them mobile headphones, you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or that night or something, but it doesn't really matter because it never really runs out because it lasts a long time when it's charged.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_01
 Something like that.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_01
 Shoot with juice.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper and the rim that could...

0:31:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it could be on that.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, on that as well.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_00
 So, are we talking about the concept of rechargeable?

0:32:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, some sort of docking station, or...

0:32:07	SPEAKER_01
 Rechargeable with a docking station.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_01
 So the rechargeable would be you?

0:32:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that'd be fine.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_03
 And also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, what's it? It's too big of a wall.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_01
 The shape, you've got trendy.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_01
 I don't want a big box with lots of things.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_01
 You don't want a tiny sort of little thing either because then you have got the repetitive string you know, matter, how many...

0:32:39	SPEAKER_01
 How much you try and make it simple.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_02
 And we don't... I mean, so many remote controls look absolutely identical.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_02
 There's a lot of brown things with the same coloured buttons or crammed in on the surface.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_02
 We definitely...

0:32:51	SPEAKER_02
 An obvious thing, a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_02
 We don't want that.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so we go off the screen.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_00
 What I was thinking of a design which Nokia came of it almost 6 or 7 years back.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_00
 Basically, we have a flat one.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_00
 It looks like a box, like a chocolate.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_00
 That's very stringous because your thumb is slightly up.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_00
 So they come of it something like this.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_00
 Covered up.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_00
 So here, and you don't have to... you know, bend your thumb too much.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_00
 So it's like a... you can say...

0:33:24	SPEAKER_00
 You kind of think curved on the boat.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_00
 So what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like this.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_00
 So it's already curved up.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_00
 So you can almost...

0:33:35	SPEAKER_00
 So we can have a...

0:33:37	SPEAKER_00
 You know, molded according to your...

0:33:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_00
 The way you hold up...

0:33:41	SPEAKER_00
 It's kind of semi-circle in the bottom.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_00
 I wouldn't say exactly semi-circle but...

0:33:46	SPEAKER_01
 You look into the company logo.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_01
 Things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_01
 For example, if it was a C or something like that, you could have it in a vague C shape to open up kind of like a shell or something.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_01
 Something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite often.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_01
 Obviously, into this design while also making it quite different, something else exciting.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_00
 We could look at that in that part.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_00
 What we were talking is to make it...

0:34:34	SPEAKER_00
 Other than like C shells logo could become...

0:34:36	SPEAKER_00
 You could put a logo in the corner of the model.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_00
 Rather than you're not trying to make it like a C shell or whatever you're telling me.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we need to think about how it's going to look different.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's... that sounds a really attractive idea.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_02
 Not come across anything like that before if it kind of...

0:34:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and that opens out into your flip top.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_02
 And it's nice to...

0:34:57	SPEAKER_02
 You can make it lightweight plastic, nice to hold in the palm of the hand.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_02
 And just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers, that's going to take care of some of the repetitive strain injury.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_02
 I've tried a lot of that out of think.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's a really nice idea.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_02
 And plus...

0:35:12	SPEAKER_02
 You can get...

0:35:13	SPEAKER_02
 Even though we're using plastic, you can still...

0:35:15	SPEAKER_02
 I think of the design you can get in plastic.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_02
 You can do a nice con shell or scallop shell.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_02
 It's easier.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_01
 You could do...

0:35:24	SPEAKER_01
 Like you get with mobile phones, different fashers.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_01
 You could have different kind of casings.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_01
 You could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleep ones.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_02
 Less chance of it being lost too.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_02
 It's not like a chocolate-brown lozenge that's going to go down the sofa.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_02
 People might want to put it on their man, talk piece or whatever.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_02
 If it looks attractive enough, as a kind of ornament, they're not going to lose it so much.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_02
 It's easier to fit nice to handle.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we could come with some safe five-six design and then choose which one...

0:35:59	SPEAKER_00
 Which will up in some way, like could be the most common design.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_00
 If you can think of five-six results.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_01
 Right, I think we have to round it out.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_02
 Can I just quickly go over the new project requirements that I haven't missed anything?

0:36:12	SPEAKER_02
 There's no teletext, only for TV and by implication video.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_02
 Corporate image should be incorporated in their own control.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_02
 Something about video plus.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_01
 That was in cutting down the number.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_01
 That was cut down the number and the function.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_01
 Right, making it simpler to instead of having lots of things.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_02
 So when they press for programming, you could come up on the LCD reminder about using video plus so that they will look at the guidance.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_02
 Is this nothing to do with the project requirements?

0:36:45	SPEAKER_02
 That was an add-on feature.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_01
 It kind of takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having a right press for the channel, things like that.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_01
 So it's kind of doing away with the programming feature.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, it could be an advertisement feature rather than design feature.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_01
 You know, draw attention to that and also pay lip service in the instruction manual.

0:37:11	SPEAKER_01
 Because it's very simple, so putting it down in words should be helpful.

0:37:15	SPEAKER_01
 And to be chargeable battery.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_02
 Was there anything else there that we need?

0:37:20	SPEAKER_02
 New project requirements?

0:37:29	SPEAKER_01
 We've got the button that I think will work through that with.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_01
 That's not at the moment our requirement.

0:37:36	SPEAKER_02
 It's something we're looking at.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_02
 We're looking at what presser and so it may come around to market research at some point.

0:37:42	SPEAKER_01
 We talked about there being the alarm or something, it being paying or being lost.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_01
 Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_01
 There aren't going to be that many functions incorporated into it.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_01
 So it should be fine.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_01
 And the instruction manual.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if we deal with that.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's...

0:38:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_01
 I'm definitely looking the more side way.

0:38:11	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's us.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_02
 What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting?

0:38:17	SPEAKER_02
 Or shall I just generally look at all the issues that you've got?

0:38:20	SPEAKER_01
 I think you might get guidance, but...

0:38:24	SPEAKER_01
 I...

0:38:26	SPEAKER_01
 In short, manuals, because it has to be a demonized thing there.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_01
 Everyone's got like a big pile of them, but no one really uses that one.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:40	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I'm just going to have to get a little bit more of a thing.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, right.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_02
 Because we're at lunchtime now, I think.

0:38:47	None
 Okay.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_01
 I think you can email me.

0:38:55	SPEAKER_01
 Is there any more questions?

0:38:58	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to ask you a question.
