0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:00:12	None
 Now my laptop is running.

0:00:19	None
 Does it again?

0:00:22	SPEAKER_03
 It's working.

0:00:29	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_03
 Good afternoon.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_03
 Good afternoon.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_03
 Everybody found this place again?

0:01:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_03
 That's nice.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_03
 This is our second meeting and still failing.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_03
 And now we're going into the functional design.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_03
 Important thing of this phase is that we're going to try together agreement about the user requirements, technical function design and the working design.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_03
 So that we can move on to the second phase.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_03
 But first is phase.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_03
 First announcement.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_03
 There's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_03
 So there's our ghost mouse again.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_03
 But that means that you can have a little trouble with the air conditioning.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_03
 That's because of this.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_03
 It's in Wing C and E.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_03
 So it should be over in a while.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_03
 A couple of days.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_03
 It's going to be cold anyway.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_03
 So I don't think you're going to need it.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_03
 Then our agenda.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_03
 Now first the opening.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_03
 This time I will take the minutes.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_03
 You're going to have a presentation.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_03
 All of you.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_03
 And we've got 40 minutes for the whole presentation.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_03
 So I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_03
 And then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements, which have been sent to me.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_03
 And then the decision on the control functions, which we want to include.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_03
 So we've got 40 minutes for all of it.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_03
 So I suggest let's start with the first presentation.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_01
 Who wants to be first?

0:03:04	SPEAKER_03
 I think I'll go first.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe it's easy if you.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think you will tell them your presentation is all which function you have.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_03
 What are you going to talk about?

0:03:26	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, my name is Freak from Poland.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_01
 I'm the market expert, but you already knew that.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_01
 I've done some research.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_01
 We have been doing research in a usability lab where we observe users operating remote controls.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_01
 We let them fill out a questionnaire.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_01
 We had 100 of these test subjects.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_01
 In addition, we did some market research.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_01
 See what the market consists of.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_01
 What ages are involved?

0:03:58	SPEAKER_01
 Well, these are three quite astonishing results, I thought.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_01
 Remote being considered ugly.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_01
 75% of the people question indicated that they thought their remote was ugly.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_01
 An additional 80% indicated that it would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_01
 So an addition remote were not very functional.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_01
 50% of the people indicated they only used about 10% of the buttons on a remote control.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_01
 And 50% of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_01
 So some things.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_01
 Then we did some research to do most relevant functions.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_01
 Channel selection and volume selection both got a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 for relevancy.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_01
 The power button got a 9 and 10 detects got a 6 and a half.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_01
 So these are the most important functions of a remote control.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_01
 Then there are some one time use function.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_01
 That's what I like to call them.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_01
 They're audio settings, video settings, and channel settings buttons, which are not really used very frequently, but are still considered to be of some importance.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 Channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently, 168 times per hour.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_01
 Then these are the, this is the market.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_01
 60% of the market consists of users between the ages 16 and 46.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_01
 The main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on a remote control.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_01
 They like to use new functions, but they also are very critical.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_01
 They won't spend their money very easily.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_01
 The users of 46 to 65 years, they make up 40% of the market.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_01
 They're not really very interested in features, but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_01
 What I think this indicates for our design, I think we should make a remote for the future.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_01
 This means we would have to focus on the ages 16 to 45.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_01
 This also makes the biggest part of the market, so there will also be where our main profit would be getable.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_01
 This would mean we would have to make a fancy design.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_01
 The results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned, thought that remote control caused errors eye.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_01
 This is certainly something to take into account.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_01
 34% thought that it was hard to learn how to operate the new remote control.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_01
 These are two factors that I think should be included in the design.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_01
 Besides, of course, the remote must look very nice.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_01
 Functionality.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_01
 As a lot of people indicated, they only use about 10% of the buttons.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should make very few buttons.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_01
 This will also be beneficial to the design of the remote.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_01
 I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasized, especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons, because they are used most.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_01
 They should be robust.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_01
 They shouldn't break down easily.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_01
 Then, as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room, and I say it might be because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_01
 But it might be a good idea to make a docking station.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_01
 It could get a button in it, which would send a signal to the remote, which would be unbeap, so you'd know where it is in the room.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_01
 And in addition to this, it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_01
 Then, surprisingly, a great deal of people indicated that an LCD screen in the remote control would be preferred.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_01
 This was mostly people in the age of 16 to 25, but up till 45 it remains feasible.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_01
 This would also greatly increase the production costs, but I think these are just some small factors we could consider.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_01
 That would be all.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 Anybody have any questions?

0:09:06	SPEAKER_03
 About functional requirements?

0:09:07	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, that's clear.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_03
 Add to the second.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_00
 Up and down, could you add that?

0:09:24	SPEAKER_00
 Usually interface, of it.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you can take your time.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_03
 We've got plenty of time.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_00
 That's a bit of a slideshow.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_00
 I think we use the general functions of the remote control.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_00
 During a little research on the internet, we're not much information about it.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_00
 About the interface.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_00
 I've been thinking about simple manner to put a lot of functions in one remote control.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_00
 You've got a lot of devices like DVD, television, stereo.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_00
 But it must be user-friendly.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_00
 So you can put a lot of functions in one remote control.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_00
 But yeah.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_00
 I've got many functions in one remote control.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_00
 But yeah, you can see this is quite simple remote control.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_00
 Fewer buttons.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_00
 But this remote control.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_00
 Got a lot of buttons.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_00
 People don't like it.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_00
 Keep the general functions like they are.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_00
 Like the on-off button.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_00
 Like a red button.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_00
 Everybody knows it.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_00
 You don't have to change that.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_00
 Personal preferences.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_00
 You use a display for specific functions of the different device.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_00
 So what I was thinking about was.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_00
 You got a remote control.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_00
 You got a general functions like the on-off button.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_00
 Here you got this kind of display.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_00
 It's a touch screen.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_00
 You got a general functions of the device for a DVD player.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_00
 For a player, a reverse, etc.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_00
 You got a real buttons for selecting a device.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_00
 So this button is for DVD or...

0:12:50	SPEAKER_00
 So for every device you got a part display of a part of a button.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_00
 You never got all the buttons on one device.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_00
 That's my idea about it.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_00
 So touch screen.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_00
 The real buttons we have to use.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_00
 We better use quite large buttons for everybody.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_00
 Everybody after you see it.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_00
 So, all people, young people.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_00
 So we must keep buttons quite simple and quite large.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_00
 It was my part of it.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_03
 There are questions about technical functions.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_02
 Do you think if we're going to use a touch screen, we're going to go way above the 12.5 euros?

0:14:03	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think so.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_00
 You got quite cheap touch screens.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_00
 It's not in color or something.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_00
 It's just one color.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_00
 I've seen something on the internet, not today, a few weeks ago.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_00
 You got quite a kind of touch screen.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_00
 For 20 euros or less.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_00
 So it's possible.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we certainly make a fancy design.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_02
 But it wouldn't be very robust.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_02
 It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_01
 That is true.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you can first listen to your presentation.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_03
 Then we have a little discussion about the requirements.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_03
 Design.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's going to.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_02
 OK, I've got a presentation about the working design.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_02
 First about how it works.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_02
 It's really simple.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_02
 Of course, everybody knows how remote works.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_02
 The user presses a button.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_02
 They remote determines what button it is.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_02
 It uses the infrared to send the signal to the TV.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_02
 The TV switches to the frequency or what function it is.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_02
 So we've got the plate.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_02
 It's a interactive disk for every button.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 When the user presses a button, the signal goes to the LED and transmits it to the TV.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_02
 It's a very simple device, technically speaking.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_02
 So this is a schematic overview.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_02
 You've got the buttons, the power source.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_02
 When the button gets pressed, it goes to the chip.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_02
 It controls the infrared bulb and perhaps a normal bulb.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 When you press a button, you can actually see your pressed button.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I think we should use default materials, simple plastics.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_02
 Keep the inner working simple so it's robust.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should focus on aesthetics, the design, and the user interface, because if you're going to use high-tech materials, the price is going to go sky high.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_02
 You only have to design a remote once, and if you use high-tech materials, it comes back in every product.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_02
 So in my idea, it's going to be smart to invest in design and not in the product itself.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_02
 That's it.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, thank you.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_03
 I am the project manager, so I'm here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_03
 We've got to design a remote which is only suitable for TV.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_03
 That's because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_03
 If we want to have it for more functions, so it has to be simple.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_03
 Another point is we have to skip the data text because in the world of upcoming internet, we think the data text is going to be a thing of the past.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_03
 It's a function we don't need in our remote control.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_03
 Internet is also mentioned just to go in a function we can use, maybe also on televisions that will be available as well.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_03
 Another one is the customer is 40 plus.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_03
 That's the market we have to target because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_03
 This is a bit pity for the marketing expert because he was aiming on the younger persons.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_03
 We have to find a market which is above 40 plus but we will suit our remote control and the other way around.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_03
 We have to be very attentive in putting the corporate image in our product.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_03
 It has to be visible in our design in the way our device works.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_03
 We have to be very clear on this point as well.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_03
 I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_01
 Is there any discussion possible about the requirements?

0:19:38	SPEAKER_03
 We can see if we can find a way between the functions we want to use and the market we want to reach with our products.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_01
 We are saying that Teletex is going to be an old feature and it's not going to be used any more anyway.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_01
 Pretty soon new TVs will have internet access on them.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_01
 If you are targeting people of 40 plus, the chance that they will have a TV with internet access within the next 20 years is very slim.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_01
 In addition, people indicated that Teletex was an important feature for the remote control.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 So I think it's pretty dumb to put no Teletex feature on it.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_01
 I'm pretty much against it.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_01
 Against the no-deletex.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_01
 Besides that, I think the market for 40 plus is pretty small.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_01
 But I think we are just going to go for another step.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 Pretty.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_03
 I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which are also mentioned.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_03
 If we put a lot of effort in those, we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons or just three modes which is suitable for the market we want to reach because it is 40% of the market.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_03
 If you look in Holland, the whole generation of 40 plus, 50 plus, it's the biggest share of the whole population now.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, but it's not the biggest part of the market.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_01
 Besides that, they're not very critical.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_01
 What the remote control is like.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_01
 It will just take the first thing I see which looks acceptable.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_03
 But don't you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market, the people think from the people think that's the device I've looked for.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't realize it, so let's try it.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_01
 I think that would be the case in 16 to 45 ages category.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_01
 Because they are critical and they want to have a fancy remote control.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_01
 People are 40 plus.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, they want it to work but as soon as it works, it's okay with them.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_02
 I think that if we put our marketing right, we can sell this just like, I don't know if you've heard about it in the news, the elderly mobile phone.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_02
 It's a big success.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_02
 If we make a remote control, just with that idea in mind, we could make tons of money.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_02
 We don't have to focus on the design then but on functionality.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_02
 We just change our focus on the project.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_02
 I think we can sell this.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_03
 I simply think that the new products we're going to make specifically designed are designed for younger people.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe we can focus ourselves on the elderly people.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_03
 I think we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_03
 Because what you told is the channel selection is important.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_03
 Volume selection, power and tailored text.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_01
 But obviously the board tends to disagree.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_03
 No, we haven't voted yet.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_03
 I think tailored text can be a function as well.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_03
 But only if you don't hire the cost.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_03
 Because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement tailored text as well.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_03
 So I think that there will be a problem.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_00
 Or is tailored text.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_03
 Definitely a bad idea not to include it.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_03
 Is anybody really against tailored text?

0:24:36	SPEAKER_03
 Let's just keep the tailored text.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's a good idea as well, especially for the subtitles.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we can make that another point of advantage in our remote control.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_03
 If we make a button, for example, for big subtitles, which is instantly on the remote control for elderly people that they can think, why I want to have subtitles and push the button and they get the big subtitles.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_03
 That's a good idea.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_03
 So I think that text can be very useful in our advantage.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_03
 Functionality should be few buttons, you said?

0:25:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's very important.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_03
 We have a few buttons.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_03
 So it's a good button.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it's really an issue anymore.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it might be.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_01
 If it's only for TV, you're not going to need a lot of buttons anyway.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_01
 We need one to zero button, next channel, previous channel, volume up, volume down.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_01
 And some tailored text buttons.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_03
 But do you need the buttons for one to zero?

0:26:11	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can...

0:26:14	SPEAKER_01
 I think many people like to use that.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can use...

0:26:19	SPEAKER_01
 I want to switch from channel one to like 35.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_01
 You know when I push the next channel button 35 times.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_03
 I can implement the scroll button or joystick.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_03
 There are other ways to...

0:26:34	SPEAKER_03
 Just look, if you look at telephones, the Sony Telephone and the scroll button, which is very useful in searching names or...

0:26:42	SPEAKER_01
 That is true, but...

0:26:46	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think there are many TVs that can switch channels that fast.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_01
 So you would need like...

0:26:55	SPEAKER_01
 A function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_01
 And I don't know if many channels do have that.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_02
 If any TVs have that.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_02
 And besides that, if we're going to focus on elderly people, they'll have to adapt.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_02
 They're not used to using scroll buttons.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_02
 Perhaps we should stick to the basic layout.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, there are numbers.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_03
 We can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_03
 And if it's too much, we can reconsider it.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_03
 But I think there won't be very much buttons.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_01
 Or there don't have to be...

0:27:35	SPEAKER_01
 I think if you're going to make remote control only to operate a TV, there's not much you can gain on...

0:27:42	SPEAKER_01
 Having as few buttons as possible.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_01
 Because I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a TV, which already only have the minimum number of buttons.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think there's much to be gained in that area.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_03
 The number of buttons.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's very important in the design.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_03
 You can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_03
 If you have less buttons, you can do a lot more with it.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_01
 That's true, but I think there's not much to gain on the competition when you're making a remote control only to operate only the TV.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_01
 If you have a remote control only to operate a TV, there's not a lot of buttons required.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_01
 There's not a lot of functions required.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_01
 Most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_01
 I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_01
 We can...

0:28:43	SPEAKER_01
 Note costs a big marketing expedition.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_01
 Which was one of the arguments to make it only for the TV because we didn't have the time to market a lot.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_03
 You should just focus on, for example, the docking station, like other functions.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_03
 Instead of less buttons.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_01
 I think we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't think we should spend very much time in that.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_03
 Do you think the docking station is allowed in the budget we have?

0:29:31	SPEAKER_02
 It should be possible, yes.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_02
 Because it's not too fancy.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_02
 And if the remote stays rather small, it should be possible.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_03
 Because I think that's a good advantage point as well.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_03
 If we have a fancy looking docking station or...

0:29:48	SPEAKER_03
 That's a nice requirement for the docking station.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_02
 So we're just going to focus on the extras.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think maybe we should do some research into what other people like to have in a...

0:30:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, like to have extra and in remote control.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_03
 That's a good point.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_03
 You said they easily get lost as well?

0:30:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, well, 50% of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe we should implement the audio side or something.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that was what I suggested.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_01
 Like with your keychain, if you were to show it goes.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it makes a sound.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_01
 You have some phones too.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_01
 Do you have a docking station?

0:30:39	SPEAKER_01
 You just press a button and the phone goes ringing.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so...

0:30:44	SPEAKER_03
 Audio signal should be possible as well.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's not too expensive.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_03
 Another point is the LCD screen.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if that will rise to cost too much.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_02
 I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen because...

0:31:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's a little bit too much.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_01
 I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices, it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it which will explain a button if you press it which would tell you what it does.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_01
 And it wouldn't have to be touch screen or expensive screen but...

0:31:38	SPEAKER_03
 Just the LCD or just the normal screen.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_03
 Just a screen ID.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_03
 Some extra info.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_03
 Feedback.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think that's a good idea as well.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't know if that would...

0:31:54	SPEAKER_03
 Is this small screen fit into the...

0:31:59	SPEAKER_01
 cost...

0:32:03	SPEAKER_03
 extra button info.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_03
 I think that should be possible as well.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_03
 Let's see what did we say...

0:32:17	SPEAKER_03
 More.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_03
 Should be fancy to design.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_03
 Is it to learn?

0:32:21	SPEAKER_03
 Few buttons.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_03
 We talked about that.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_03
 Talking Station LCD.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_03
 General functions.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_03
 And default materials.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's a good idea as well because...

0:32:48	SPEAKER_03
 So don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_03
 So it doesn't really matter.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_01
 Probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls and youngsters.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_03
 And let's specify the target group.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_03
 Are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from 40 to...

0:33:17	SPEAKER_03
 80 because I think what we're going to design now is for people above 60.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_03
 What do we want?

0:33:31	SPEAKER_03
 If we want to...

0:33:33	SPEAKER_03
 profil it as with...

0:33:35	SPEAKER_03
 For example, the telephone for elderly people.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_03
 We can target the real elderly people.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_01
 I think that would be...

0:33:45	SPEAKER_01
 If we should do something like that, it would be...

0:33:48	SPEAKER_01
 I think it would be really good for the image of the company.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_01
 And I think there would be a good market for it.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_01
 So that's the...

0:34:00	SPEAKER_01
 Really bring an innovative product.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_03
 You're talking about 60 to 80, for example.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_03
 The really...

0:34:08	SPEAKER_03
 About 60.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_01
 I'd have to look into that a little more.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. And different cultures.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_03
 Are we?

0:34:17	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think they have different television sets in every country.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_03
 You've got five minutes left.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_03
 It's small work.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_01
 And with the little screen in it, which explains the buttons, I think it would be a lot easier to adapt to different cultures.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. In different languages.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_03
 Or you have to put a language button in it, but that will be a bit unnecessary, I think.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_03
 It's better to put it on different markets with...

0:34:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_03
 So that's the target.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_03
 Then a few small things.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_03
 I will put the minutes in the project document folder.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_03
 What we're going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_03
 Use the interface design and the user interface concept and the trend watching.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_03
 So just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group requirements and the trends, which we're going on.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_03
 And the specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_03
 So I thank you for this meeting.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_03
 And I think we have a lunch break now.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_00
 That's good.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_03
 So that's a good thing.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_01
 Now we're not allowed to talk about it.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:36:27	None
 Okay.

0:36:37	None
 Okay.
