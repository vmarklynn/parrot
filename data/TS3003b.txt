0:00:00	None
 Big sitting, good, release.

0:00:06	SPEAKER_03
 Good session.

0:00:11	None
 Take this in little bit.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_03
 Now my laptop is funny.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_03
 It does it again.

0:00:33	None
 It's working.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, good afternoon.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, everybody found this place again?

0:00:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's nice.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so this is our second meeting and still failing.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and now we're going into the functional design.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_03
 The important thing of this phase is that we're going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements, technical function design and the working design.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_03
 So that we can move on to the second phase.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_03
 But first is phase.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_03
 First announcement, there's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_03
 So there's our ghost mouse again.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_03
 But that means that you can have a little trouble with air conditioning.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_03
 That's because of this.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, it's in wing C and E. So it should be over in a while, a couple of days.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_03
 It's going to be cold anyway, so I don't think you're going to need it.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_03
 Then our agenda, first the opening.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_03
 This time I will take the minutes.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_03
 You're going to have a presentation, all of you.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_03
 We've got 40 minutes for the whole presentations.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_03
 So I suggest we take about 7 minutes per presentation.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_03
 Then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements, which have been sent to me.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_03
 Then the decision on the control functions, which we want to include.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_03
 So we've got 40 minutes for all of it.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_03
 So I suggest let's start with the first presentation.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_03
 Who wants to be first?

0:03:02	SPEAKER_03
 I think I'll go first.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it's easy if you will tell the presentation as well.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_03
 Which function you have and where you're going to talk about.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, my name is Frank Vamponin.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_01
 I'm the market expert, but you already knew that.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_01
 I've done some research.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_01
 We have been doing research in a usability lab where we observe users operating remote controls.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_01
 We let them fill out a questionnaire.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_01
 We had 100 of these test subjects.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_01
 In addition, we did some market research.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_01
 See what the market consists of, what ages are involved.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_01
 Well, these are three quite astonishing results, I thought.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_01
 Remotes are being considered ugly.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_01
 They indicated that they thought they were ugly.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_01
 An additional 80% indicated that it would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_01
 In addition, remote were not very functional.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_01
 50% indicated they only used about 10% of the buttons on a remote control.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_01
 50% indicated that the remote tended to get lost in their room.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_01
 So, some things.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_01
 Then we did some research to do most relevant functions.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_01
 Channel selection and volume selection both got a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 for relevancy.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_01
 The power button got a 9 and 10 attacks got a 6.5.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_01
 So, these are the most important functions of a remote control.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_01
 Then there are some one-time use function.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_01
 That's what I like to call them.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_01
 They're audio settings, video settings, and channel settings buttons, which are not really used very frequently, but are still considered to be of some importance.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 Channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently, 168 times per hour.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_01
 Then this is the market.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_01
 60% of the market consists of users between the ages 16 and 46.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_01
 Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical under remote control.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_01
 They like to use new functions, but they also are very critical.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_01
 They won't spend their money very easily.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_01
 The users of 46 to 65 years make up 40% of the market.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_01
 They're not really very interested in features, but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_01
 What I think this indicates for our design, I think we should make a remote for the future.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_01
 This means we would have to focus on the ages 16 to 45.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_01
 This also makes the biggest part of the market, so it would also be where our main profit would be getable.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_01
 This would mean we would have to make a fancy design.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_01
 The results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned thought that remote control caused errors high.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_01
 This is certainly something to take into account, and 34% thought that it was hard to learn and how to operate the new remote control.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_01
 These are two factors that I think should be included in the design, besides of course that the remote must look very nice.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_01
 Functionality, as a lot of people indicated, they only use about 10% of the buttons.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should make very few buttons.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_01
 This will also be beneficial to the design of the remote.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_01
 I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasized, especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons, because they are used most, so they should be robust, they shouldn't break down easily.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_01
 Then, as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room, it might be, and I say it might be because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot, but it might be a good idea to make a docking station.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_01
 This would get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep, so you know where it is in the room, and in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_01
 Then, surprisingly, a great deal of people indicated that an LCD screen in the remote control would be preferred.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_01
 This was mostly people in the age of 16 to 25, but up to 45 it remains feasible.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_01
 This would also greatly increase the production costs, so I think these are just some small factors we could consider.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. That would be all.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 Anybody have any questions still now?

0:09:05	SPEAKER_03
 About functional requirements.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, that's clear.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_03
 Add to the second.

0:09:12	None
 Okay.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_00
 You should interface.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_00
 For the technical functions of it.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you can take your time.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_03
 We've got plenty of time.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_03
 That's pretty good.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think we must use the general functions of the remote control.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_00
 I've learned a little research on the internet.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_00
 Not much information about it.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_00
 About interface.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_00
 I've been thinking about simple manner to put a lot of functions in one remote control.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_00
 You've got a lot of devices like DVD, television, stereo.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_00
 But it must be user-friendly.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_00
 You can put a lot of functions in one remote control.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_00
 In one remote control.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_00
 Got many functions in one remote control.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_00
 You can see this is quite simple remote control.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_00
 A few buttons.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_00
 But this remote control.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_00
 Got a lot of buttons.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_00
 People don't like it.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_00
 So what I was thinking about was I was thinking about it like the on-off button.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_00
 I keep it like a red button.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_00
 Everybody knows it.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_00
 You don't have to change that.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_00
 My personal preferences.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_00
 Use a display for specific functions of the different device.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_00
 You've got the on-off button.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_00
 So you've got the functions of the device for a DVD player.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_00
 You've got real buttons for selecting a device.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_00
 So this button is for a DVD.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_00
 Every device you've got a part display of buttons.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_00
 So you've never got all the buttons on one device.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_00
 So that's my idea about it.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_00
 So that's me.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_00
 The buttons, the real buttons we have to use.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_00
 We better use quite large buttons for everybody after you see it.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_00
 So if all people, young people, so we must keep buttons quite simple and quite large.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_00
 That was my part of it.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_03
 So any other questions about technical functions?

0:13:55	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I think if we're going to use a touch screen, we're going to go way above the 12 and a half euros.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think so.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_00
 You've got quite a cheap touch screen.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_00
 It's not in the corner or something.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_00
 It's just one call.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_00
 I've seen something on the Internet, not today, but a few weeks ago.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_00
 You've got quite a kind of touch screen.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_00
 It's for 20 euros or less.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_00
 So it's possible.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_03
 It's nice.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we certainly make a fancy design.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_02
 It wouldn't be very robust.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_02
 It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_01
 That is true.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we can first listen to your presentation.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_03
 Then we have a little discussion about the requirements.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_03
 Design.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's going to do.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_03
 It's not that much.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_02
 I've got a presentation about the working design.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_02
 First about how it works.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_02
 It's really simple, of course, everybody knows how remote works.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_02
 The user presses a button.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_02
 The remote determines what button it is.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_02
 Uses the infrared to send the signal to the TV.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_02
 The TV switches to the frequency or what function it is.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_02
 So we've got the plate.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 It's got conductive disks for every button.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_02
 When the user presses a button, a signal goes to the LED and transmits it to the TV.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_02
 It's a very simple device, technically speaking.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_02
 So this is a schematic overview.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_02
 You've got the buttons, the power source.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_02
 When a button gets pressed, it goes to the chip.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_02
 The chip controls the infrared bulb and perhaps a normal bulb.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 When you press a button, you can actually see your pressed button.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I think we should use default materials, simple plastics.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_02
 Keep the inner working simple so it's robust.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should focus on aesthetics, the design and the user interface because if you're going to use high-tech materials, the price is going to go sky-high.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_02
 And you only have to design a remote once.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_02
 And if you use high-tech materials, it comes back in every product.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_02
 So in my idea, it's going to be smart to invest in design and not in the product itself.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_02
 That's it.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, thank you.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_03
 I'm the project manager, so I'm here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_03
 We've got to design a remote which is only suitable for TV.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_03
 That's because it will be too complex and the time to mark it will be too big if we want to have it for more functions.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_03
 So it has to be simple.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_03
 Another point is we have to skip the data text because in the world of upcoming Internet we think data text is going to be a thing of the past.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_03
 And it's a function we don't need in our remote control.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_03
 Internet is also mentioned just to go in a function we can use, maybe also on televisions that will be available as well.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_03
 Another one is the customer is 40 plus.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_03
 That's the market we have to target because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_03
 This is a bit pity for the marketing expert because he was aiming on the younger persons.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_03
 So we have to find a market which is above 40 plus but which will suit our remote control and the other way around.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_03
 And we have to be very attentive in putting the corporate image in our product.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_03
 So it has to be visible in our design in the way our device works.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_03
 And we have to be very clear on this point as well.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_03
 So I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_01
 So is there any discussion possible about the requirements?

0:19:38	SPEAKER_03
 We can see if we can find a way between the functions we want to use and the market we want to reach with our product.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_01
 You are saying that teletext is going to be an old feature and it's not going to be used anymore anyway.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_01
 Pretty soon new TVs will have internet access on them.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_01
 But I think if you are targeting people of 40 plus the chance that they will have a TV with internet access within the next 20 years is very slim.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_01
 In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_01
 I'm pretty much against it.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_03
 Against the no data text?

0:20:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_01
 Besides that I think the market for 40 plus is like pretty small.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_01
 But if I see this I think we are just going to go for another step.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_01
 Pretty much.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_03
 I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which are also mentioned.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_03
 If we put a lot of effort in those we can make remote control with just two or three buttons or just a remote which is suitable for the market.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_03
 It's suitable for the market you want to reach because it is 40% of the market and if you look in Holland the whole generation of 40 plus 50 plus it's the biggest share of the whole population now.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yes but it's not the biggest part of the market.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_01
 Besides that they are not very critical so I mean they don't really care what the remote control is like.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_01
 They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_03
 But don't you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market that people think from the people think that's the device I've looked for although I didn't realize it.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_03
 So let's try it.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_01
 I think that would be the case in 16 to 45 age category because they are critical and they want to have a fancy remote control.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_01
 People are 40 plus I mean they want it to work but as soon as it works it's okay with them.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_02
 If we put our marketing right we can sell this just like I don't know if you've heard about it in the news the elderly mobile phone.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah it's a big success.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_02
 If we make a remote control with that idea in mind we could make tons of money I think.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_02
 We don't have to focus on the design then but on functionality. We just change our focus on the project.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_02
 And I think we can sell this.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_03
 I simply think that the new products we're going to make specifically design are designed for younger people.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe we can focus ourselves on the elderly people.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_03
 And I think we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls because what you told is the channel selection is important.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_03
 The volume selection power and data text.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_01
 But obviously the board tends to disagree.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_03
 No we haven't voted yet.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_03
 I think that can be a function as well.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_03
 But only if it's going to hire the cost.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_03
 Because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement data text as well.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_03
 But I don't think that will be a problem.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_03
 Or is data text.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_00
 And deaf people need data text for subtitles.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_01
 So I suggest that.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_01
 Definitely be a bad idea not to include data text.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_03
 Is anybody really against data text?

0:24:34	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_03
 Just that.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_03
 Just keep the data text.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's good idea as well.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_03
 Especially for the subtitles.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we can make that another point of advantage in our remote control.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_03
 If we make a button for example for big subtitles.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_03
 Which is instantly on the remote control for elderly people that they can think I want to have subtitles and push the button and they get the big subtitles.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_03
 That's a good idea.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_03
 So I think that can be very useful in our advantage.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_03
 Functionality should be few buttons you said.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's very important.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_03
 We have a few buttons.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_03
 So to keep it simple.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think that's really an issue anymore.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_01
 If it's only for TV you're not going to need a lot of buttons anyway.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_01
 You need one to zero button.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_01
 Next channel, previous channel.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_01
 Pull him up, pull him down.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_01
 And some teletext buttons.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_03
 But do you need?

0:26:03	SPEAKER_00
 I think we can skip this place or we need it.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_03
 Do you need buttons for one to zero?

0:26:11	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_01
 I think many people like to use that.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can use it.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_01
 You want to switch from channel one to like 35.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_01
 You don't want to push the next channel button 35 times.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you can implement the scroll button.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_03
 Or joystick.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_03
 There are other ways to just look.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_03
 There are other phones.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_01
 There's only telephones in the scroll button which is very useful in searching names.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think there are many TVs that can switch channels that fast.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_01
 So you would need like the TV would need a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_01
 If there are any TVs out there.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_02
 And besides that, if we're going to focus on elderly people, they'll have to adapt.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_02
 They're not used to using scroll buttons.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_02
 Perhaps we should stick to the basic layout.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, the numbers.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_03
 We can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_03
 And if it's too much, we can reconsider it.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_03
 But I think there won't be very much buttons or they're done.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_01
 I think if you're going to make remote control only to operate a TV, there's not much you can gain on having as few buttons as possible.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_01
 Because I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a TV which already only have the minimum number of buttons.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think there's much to be gained in that area.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_03
 The number of buttons.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's very important in the design.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_03
 You can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_03
 If you have less buttons, you can do a lot more with it.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_01
 That is true.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_01
 But I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the TV.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_03
 To operate only the TV.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_01
 There's simply not a lot of buttons required.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_01
 There's not a lot of functions required.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_01
 So most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_01
 So I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_01
 So it would cost a big marketing expedition.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_01
 Which was one of the arguments to make it only for the TV because we didn't have the time to market a lot.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_03
 So you suggest we could better focus on, for example, the docking station.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_03
 Like other functions.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_03
 Instead of less buttons.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't think we should spend very much time in that.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_03
 Do you think the docking station is allowed in the budget we have?

0:29:31	SPEAKER_02
 It should be possible, yes.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_02
 Because it's not too fancy.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_02
 And if the remote stays rather small, it should be possible.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_03
 Because I think that's a good advantage point as well if we have a fancy looking docking station.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_03
 Or very...

0:29:51	SPEAKER_03
 That's a nice requirement.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_02
 So we're just going to focus on the extras.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think maybe we should do some research into what other people like to have in a...

0:30:08	SPEAKER_01
 We like to have X-raying in remote control.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_03
 That's a good point.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_03
 You said they easily get lost as well?

0:30:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, well, 50% of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe we should implement the audio site or something.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that was what I suggested.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_01
 Like with your keychain, if you were a solid girl, it makes us...

0:30:34	SPEAKER_01
 We have some phones too.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_01
 And you have a docking station.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_01
 You just press the button and the phone goes ringing.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so the audio signal should be possible as well.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's not too expensive.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_03
 Another point is the LCD screen.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if that will rise to cost too much.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_02
 I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen, because...

0:31:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's going to be too much as well.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_01
 I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control was hard to learn.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_01
 And we're focusing on elderly people here, which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_01
 It might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it, which would explain a button if you press it, which would tell you what it does.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_01
 And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_03
 Just the LCD or just the normal screen.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_03
 Just a small screen ID.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_03
 Some extra info.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_03
 Feedback.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think that's a good idea as well.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't know if that would...

0:31:54	SPEAKER_03
 Just a small screen heading to the...

0:31:58	SPEAKER_01
 Cost.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_03
 Extra button info.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_03
 I think that should be possible as well.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_03
 Let's see, what did we say more?

0:32:18	SPEAKER_03
 Should be fancy design.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_03
 Easy to learn.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_03
 Few buttons.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_03
 Talking station LCD.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_03
 General functions.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_03
 And default materials.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's a good idea as well because...

0:32:47	SPEAKER_03
 LDP people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_03
 So it doesn't really matter.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_01
 I think...

0:32:59	SPEAKER_01
 Probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls and youngsters.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_03
 And let's specify the target group.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_03
 Are we talking about elderly people or people from 40 to 80?

0:33:19	SPEAKER_03
 Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above 60.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_03
 What do we want?

0:33:31	SPEAKER_03
 If we want to proflate us with, for example, the telephone for elderly people, we can target the real elderly people.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_01
 I think that would be... if we should do something like that, I think it would be really good for the image of the company.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_01
 And I think there would be a good market for it.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_03
 So that's the...

0:33:59	SPEAKER_01
 Really bringing enough of the product.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_03
 You're talking about 60 to 80, for example.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_03
 But 60.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_01
 I'd have to look into that a little more.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_03
 And different cultures.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_03
 Why are we...

0:34:17	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I don't think they have different television sets in every country.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_00
 Because...

0:34:27	SPEAKER_03
 We've got five minutes left.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_03
 It's a small word.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_01
 And with the little screen in it, which explains the buttons, I think it would be a lot easier to adapt to two different cultures.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_03
 In different languages.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_03
 Or you have to put a language button in it, but that will be a bit unnecessary, I think.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_03
 It's better to put it on different markets with...

0:34:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_03
 So that's the target.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_03
 Then a few small things.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_03
 I will put the minutes in the project document folder.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_03
 What we're going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept, user interface designer, user interface concept, and the trend watching.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_03
 So just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group requirements and the trends, the trends that are going on, and the specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_03
 So I thank you for this meeting.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_03
 And I think we have a lunch break now.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_00
 That's good.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_03
 So that's a good thing.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not allowed to talk about it.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:36:31	None
 Okay.

0:36:41	None
 Okay.
