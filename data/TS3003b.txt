0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 Good ethos.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_03
 Now my laptop the h unintelligible.

0:00:29	SPEAKER_03
 Does it again?

0:00:31	SPEAKER_03
 It's working.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_03
 OK, good afternoon.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_03
 OK, everybody found this place again?

0:00:45	None
 Yeah, that's nice.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_00
 OK, so this is our second meeting.

0:00:52	None
 And still failing.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_03
 Now we're going into the functional design.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_03
 A important thing of this phase is that we're going to try to get an agreement about the user and the user and the user.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_03
 OK, so we're going to go to the first meeting.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_03
 OK, so we're going to go to the first meeting.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_03
 OK, everybody found this place again?

0:01:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's nice.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_03
 OK, so this is our second meeting.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_03
 We're going to talk a little bit about the user requirements, technical function design and the working design so that we can move on to the second phase.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_03
 But first is phase.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_03
 First announcement, there's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_03
 So there's our ghost mouse again.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_03
 That means that you can have a little trouble with air conditioning.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_03
 That's because of this.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_03
 OK, it's in wing C and E.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_03
 So it should be over in a while, a couple of days.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_03
 It's going to be cold anyway, so I don't think you're going to need it.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_03
 Then our agenda, first the opening.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_03
 This time I will take the minutes.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_03
 You're going to have a presentation, all of you.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_03
 And we've got 40 minutes for the whole presentations.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_03
 So I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation, and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements, which have been sent to me.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_03
 And then the decision on the control functions, which we want to include, which we don't want to include.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_03
 So we've got 40 minutes for all of it.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_03
 So I suggest let's start with the first presentation.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_03
 Who wants to be first?

0:03:02	SPEAKER_01
 I think I'll go first.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe it's easy if you, yeah, I think you will tell them your presentation as well, which function you have, and where are you going to talk about?

0:03:20	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_01
 My name is Frank Vamponin.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_01
 I'm the market expert, but you already knew that.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_01
 I've done some research.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_01
 We have been doing research in a usability lab where we observe users operating remote systems.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_01
 We let them fill out a questionnaire.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_01
 We had 100 of these test subjects.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_01
 In addition, we did some market research.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_01
 See what the market consists of, what ages are involved.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_01
 Well, these are three quite astonishing results, I thought.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_01
 These are being considered ugly, 75% of the people question indicated that they thought in a remote was ugly, and an additional 80% indicated that it would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_01
 So in addition, remote were not very functional.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_01
 50% of the people indicated they only used about 10% of the buttons on a remote control.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_01
 And 50% of the people indicated that the remote tended to get lost in their room.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_01
 So, some things.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_01
 Then we did some research to do the most relevant functions.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_01
 Channel selection and volume selection both got a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 for relevancy.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_01
 The power button got a 9, and teletext got a 6.5.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_01
 So these are the most important functions of a remote control.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_01
 Then there are some one time use function.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_01
 That's what I like to call them.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_01
 They're the audio settings, video settings, and channel settings buttons, which are not really used very frequently, but are still considered to be of some importance.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_01
 Channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently, 168 times per hour.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_01
 Then this is the market.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_01
 60% of the market consists of users between the ages 16 and 46.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_01
 Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical under remote control.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_01
 They like to use new functions, but they also are very critical.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_01
 They won't spend their money very easily.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_01
 So the users of 46 to 65 years, they make up 40% of the market.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_01
 They're not really very interested in features, but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_01
 What I think this indicates for our design, I think we should make a remote for the future.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_01
 This means we would have to focus on the ages 16 to 45.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_01
 This also makes up most the biggest part of the market, so it would also be where our main profit would be getable.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_01
 This would mean we would have to make a fancy design.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_01
 The results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned thought that remote control caused errors, errors high.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_01
 This is certainly something to take into account.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_01
 And 34% thought that it was hard to learn how to operate the new remote control.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_01
 So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_01
 Besides, of course, the remote must look very nice.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_01
 Functionality, as a lot of people indicated, they only use about 10% of the buttons.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should make very few buttons.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_01
 This will also be beneficial to the design of the remote.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_01
 I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasized, especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons, because they are used most.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_01
 So they should be robust. They shouldn't break down easily.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_01
 Then, as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room, it might be, and I say it might be, because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_01
 But it might be a good idea to make a docking station.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_01
 This would get a button in it, which would send a signal to the remote, which would then beep, so you know where it is in the room.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_01
 And in addition to this, it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_01
 Then, surprisingly, a great deal of people indicated that an LCD screen in the remote control would be preferred.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_01
 This was mostly people in the age of 16 to 25, but up to 45, it remains feasible.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_01
 This would also greatly increase the production costs, but I think these are just some small factors we could consider.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. That would be all.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 Anybody have any questions?

0:09:04	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_03
 About functional requirements.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, that's clear.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_03
 To the second.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_00
 I've been looking at that.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_00
 Usually interface of it.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_00
 For the technical functions of it.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you can take your time. We've got plenty of time.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_01
 That's been a slideshow.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_00
 There it is.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_00
 I think we must use the general functions of the remote control.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_00
 I've learned a little research on the internet.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_00
 Not much information about it.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_00
 About interface.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_00
 I've been thinking about Simple manner to put a lot of functions in one remote control.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_00
 You've got a lot of device like DVD, television, stereo.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_00
 But it must be user friendly.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_00
 You can put a lot of functions in one remote control.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_00
 Got many functions in one remote control.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_00
 But you can see this is quite simple remote control.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_00
 Few buttons.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_00
 But this remote control got a lot of buttons.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_00
 People don't like it.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_00
 So what I was thinking about was keep the general functions like the RS.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_00
 Like the on-off button.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_00
 Keep it like a red button.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_00
 Everybody knows it.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_00
 You don't have to change that.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_00
 My personal preferences.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_00
 Use a display for specific functions of the different device.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_00
 What I was thinking about was you've got this the remote control.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_00
 You've got the general functions like the on-off button.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_00
 Here you've got a kind of display.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_00
 It's a touch screen.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_00
 You've got the general functions of the device for a DVD player.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_00
 For playing a reverse setter.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_00
 You've got real buttons for selecting a device.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 This button is for a DVD or a DVD.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_00
 For every device you've got a part display of a part buttons.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_00
 You never got all the buttons on one device.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_00
 That's my idea about it.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_00
 The buttons we have to use.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_00
 We better use quite large buttons for everybody.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_00
 If all people are young people, we must keep buttons quite simple and quite large.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_00
 That was my part of it.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_03
 Any other questions about technical functions?

0:13:56	SPEAKER_02
 I think if we're going to use a touch screen, we're going to go way above the 12 and half euros.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think so.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_00
 You've got quite a cheap touch screen.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_00
 It's not in color or something.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_00
 One color.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_00
 I've seen something on the Internet.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_00
 Not today, but a few weeks ago.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_00
 It's quite a touch screen for 20 euros or less.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_03
 It's possible.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_01
 We certainly make a fancy design.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_02
 It wouldn't be very robust.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_01
 It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we can first listen to your presentation.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_03
 We have a little discussion about the requirements.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's going to do.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_02
 I've got a presentation about the working design.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_02
 First about how it works.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_02
 It's really simple, of course.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_02
 Everybody knows how a remote works.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_02
 The user presses a button.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_02
 It determines what button it is, uses the infrared to send the signal to the TV switch to the frequency, or what function it is.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_02
 We've got the plate.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_02
 It's got conductive disks for every button.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 When the user presses a button, a signal goes to the LED and transmits it to the TV.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_02
 It's a very simple device, technically speaking.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_02
 This is a schematic overview.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_02
 You've got the buttons, the power source.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_02
 When a button gets pressed, it goes to the chip.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_02
 The chip controls the infrared bulb and perhaps a normal bulb.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 When you press a button, you can actually see your pressed button.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should use default materials, simple plastics.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_02
 Keep the inner working simple, so it's robust.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should focus on aesthetics, the design and the user interface, because if you're going to use high-tech materials, the price is going to go sky-high.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_02
 You only have to design a remote once, and if you use high-tech materials, it comes back in every product.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_02
 In my idea, it's going to be smart to invest in design and not in the product itself.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_02
 That's it.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_03
 Now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we're doing right now.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_03
 I'm the project manager, so I'm here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_03
 We've got to design a remote which is only suitable for TV.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_03
 That's because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big if we want to have it for more functions.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_03
 So it has to be simple.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_03
 Another point is we have to skip the data text because in the world of upcoming internet, we think data text is going to be a thing of the past.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_03
 It's a function we don't need in our remote control.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_03
 The internet is also mentioned just to go in a function we can use maybe also on televisions that will be available as well.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_03
 Another one is the customer is 40 plus.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_03
 That's the market we have to target because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_03
 This is a bit pity for the marketing expert because he was aiming on the younger persons.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_03
 We have to find a market which is above 40 plus but which will suit our remote control and the other way around.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_03
 We have to be very attentive in putting the corporate image in our product so it has to be visible in our design in the way our device works.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_03
 We have to be very clear on this point as well.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_03
 I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_01
 Is there any discussion possible about the requirements?

0:19:38	SPEAKER_03
 We can see if we can find a way between the functions we want to use and the market we want to reach with our product.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_01
 You're saying that teletext is going to be an old feature and it's not going to be used anymore anyway pretty soon and new TVs will have internet access on them.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_01
 I think if you're targeting people of 40 plus the chance that they will have a TV with internet access within the next 20 years is very slim.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_01
 In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_01
 I'm pretty much against it.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_01
 I think the market for 40 plus is pretty small.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_01
 I think we're just going to go for another step.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_03
 I think we can do a lot with the design.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_03
 The simple buttons which are also mentioned.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_03
 If we put a lot of effort in those we can make remote control with just two or three buttons or just three more which is suitable for the market we want to reach because it is 40% of the market.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_03
 If you look in Holland the whole generation of 40 plus 50 plus is the biggest share of the whole population now.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yes but it's not the biggest part of the market.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_01
 Besides that they're not very critical.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_01
 They don't really care what the remote control is like. They'll just take the first thing they see which looks acceptable.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_03
 But don't you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market that people think from the people think that's the device I've looked for although I didn't realize it.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_03
 Let's try it.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_01
 I think that would be the case in 16 to 45 age category because they are critical and they want to have a fancy remote control.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_01
 People are 40 plus.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_01
 I mean they want it to work but as soon as it works it's okay with them.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_02
 I think that if we put our marketing right we can sell this just like I don't know if you've heard about it in the news the elderly mobile phone.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_02
 It's a big success.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_02
 If we make a remote control with that idea in mind we could make tons of money.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_02
 We don't have to focus on the design then but on functionality. We just change our focus on the project.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_02
 I think we can sell this.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_03
 I simply think that the new products we're going to make specifically design are designed for younger people.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we can focus ourselves on the elderly people. I think we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_03
 The channel selection is important. The volume selection power and data text.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_03
 No we haven't voted yet. I think data text can be a function as well but only if it's not higher the cost.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement data text as well but I don't think it will be a problem.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_03
 I think it would be a bad idea not to include data text.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we can make another point of advantage in our remote control.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_03
 I think we can make a button for big subtitles which is instantly on the remote control for elderly people.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_03
 I think it would be useful in our advantage.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_01
 It's very important. We have a few buttons.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_01
 I think we can make a button for the next channel, the previous channel, volume up, volume down and some teletext buttons.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can use the next channel button 35 times.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we can implement the scroll button or joystick. There are other ways to look at telephones.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_03
 The Sony telephone and the scroll button which is very useful in searching names.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think there are many TVs that can switch channels that fast.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_01
 You would need a function where you can view all channels and scroll through it.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_02
 Besides that if we are going to focus on elderly people they will have to adapt.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_03
 Perhaps we should stick to the basic layout.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_03
 If it's too much we can reconsider it.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_01
 I think if you are going to make a remote control only to operate a TV, there is not much you can gain on having a few buttons as possible.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_01
 There are many remote controls that can only operate a TV which only have the minimum number of buttons.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think there is much to be gained in that area.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_03
 The number of buttons.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's very important in the design.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_03
 You can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_03
 If you have less buttons you can do a lot more of it.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_01
 That is true but I think there is simply not much to gain on the competition when you are making a remote control only to operate only the TV.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_01
 If you have a remote control only to operate a TV there is simply not a lot of buttons required.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_01
 There is not a lot of functions required.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_01
 Most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_01
 I think it would be very hard to gain on the competition here.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_01
 That would cost a big marketing expedition which was one of the arguments to make it only for the TV because we didn't have the time to market a lot.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_03
 You should just we could better focus on for example the docking station like other functions.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_03
 Instead of less buttons.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_01
 I mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't think we should spend very much time in that.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_03
 Do you think the docking station is allowed in the budget we have?

0:29:31	SPEAKER_02
 It should be possible.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_02
 It is not too fancy and if the remote stays rather small it should be possible.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_03
 I think that is a good advantage point as well if we have a fancy looking docking station.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_03
 That is a nice requirement for the station.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_02
 We are just going to focus on the extras.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_01
 I think so.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we should do some research into what other people like to have in a remote control.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_03
 That is a good point.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_03
 You said they easily get lost as well.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yes well 50% of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_03
 We should implement the audio site or something.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah that was what I suggested.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_01
 We have keychain if you were to saw it go.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_01
 We have some phones too.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_01
 We just press the button and the phone goes ringing.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_03
 Audio signal should be possible as well.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_03
 I think it is not too expensive.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_03
 Another point is the LCD screen.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if that will rise the cost too much.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_02
 I think we will have to choose between the docking station or the screen.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah it will be too much as well.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_01
 I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control was hard to learn.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_01
 We are focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_01
 It might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it which would explain a button if you press it.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_01
 Which would tell you what it does.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_01
 And it wouldn't have to be touch screen or a very expensive screen.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_03
 Just the LCD or just the normal screen.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_03
 Just a small screen.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_03
 Some extra info feedback.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah I think that is a good idea as well.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't know if that would...

0:31:54	SPEAKER_03
 Is this small screen fitting to the...

0:31:58	SPEAKER_01
 cost?

0:32:02	SPEAKER_03
 Extra button info.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_03
 I think it should be possible as well.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_03
 Let's see what did we say more.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_03
 It should be fancy design.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_03
 Easy to learn.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_03
 Few buttons.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_03
 We talked about that.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_03
 The docking station LCD.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_03
 General functions.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_03
 And default materials.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_03
 I think that is a good idea as well because...

0:32:48	SPEAKER_03
 LDP people don't mind if it is a titanium cover or just a plastic one.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_03
 So it doesn't really matter.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_01
 Probably elderly people would be a little more careful with their remote controls and youngsters.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_03
 And let's specify the target group.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_03
 Are we talking about elderly people or people from 40 to 80?

0:33:20	SPEAKER_03
 Because I think what we are going to design now is for people above 60.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_03
 What do we want?

0:33:31	SPEAKER_03
 If we want to proflate us with...

0:33:36	SPEAKER_03
 For example, the telephone for elderly people, we can target the real elderly people.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_01
 I think that would be...

0:33:46	SPEAKER_01
 If we should do something like that, it would be...

0:33:48	SPEAKER_01
 I think it would be really good for the image of the company.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_01
 And I think there would be a good market for it.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_01
 So that's the...

0:34:00	SPEAKER_01
 Really bringing innovative product.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_03
 And you're talking about 60 to 80, for example.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, really.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_01
 I'd have to look into that a little more.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_03
 And different cultures.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I don't think they have different television sets in every country.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_00
 Of course.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_03
 He's got five minutes left.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_01
 He's got a small one.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_01
 And with the little screen in it, which explains the buttons, I think it would be a lot easier to adapt to two different cultures.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_03
 In different languages.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_03
 Or you have to put a language button in it, but that will be a bit unnecessary.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_03
 It's better to put it on different markets with...

0:34:53	SPEAKER_03
 You know.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_03
 So that's the target.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_03
 Then a few small things.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_03
 I will put the minutes in the project document folder.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_03
 What we're going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_03
 Using interface designer to use interface concept and the trend watching.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_03
 So just keep in mind the things we've said about the...

0:35:27	SPEAKER_03
...about the target group requirements and the trends which are going on.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_03
 And the specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_03
 So I thank you for this meeting.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_03
 And I think we have a lunch break now.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_00
 That's good.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_03
 That's a good thing.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_01
 Now we're not allowed to talk about it.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:36:34	None
 Thank you.

0:36:44	None
 Thank you.
