 Hello again.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_01
 Hey, Project Manager.

0:00:08	SPEAKER_04
 Project Manager, I'm talking to tell you I have little problems with my laptop.

0:00:12	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_04
 So I had a little less time to complete.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:00:20	SPEAKER_04
 A little problem.

0:00:24	SPEAKER_04
 A little problem.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_04
 A little problem.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_04
 A little problem.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_01
 A little problem.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_01
 Project Manager.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_01
 Your project manager.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_03
 Welcome to the conceptual design meeting for real reaction.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_03
 Hello again.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_03
 It's the same as the last time.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_03
 Also this time there will be three presentations.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_03
 And we must reach a decision on the remote control concepts.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_03
 At the end, when I finish it off, I have some info from a more class I visited.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_03
 I have some information.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_01
 I'm doing a lot.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_03
 Mostly.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_03
 I used to master.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_03
 The concepts on where we must reach a decision on are from RF2 sorts.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_03
 Component concepts and user interface concepts.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_03
 The first one is really about the total package.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we have decided to do the touch screen.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_03
 But it must be a case around it.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_03
 So it won't be as breakable.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_03
 How about the energy?

0:02:06	SPEAKER_03
 Can you reload it?

0:02:08	SPEAKER_03
 Or just berries which you must exchange?

0:02:10	SPEAKER_03
 The user interface concept with the type and the supplements where to put word button.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_03
 And I would say, yes, can you begin?

0:02:23	SPEAKER_03
 Sure.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_03
 At the end, I will take notes.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_03
 At the end, the minute will be at the share pool.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_00
 Let me see.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's this one.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I'll be talking about components.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_00
 What I did was I reviewed previously used items by two different age groups.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_00
 Below 45 and above.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_00
 And I just watched what the differences are.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_00
 I checked what we want and how can we aim at the target group.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_00
 What I found was that senior citizens.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_00
 It's okay.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_00
 They like the traditional materials like wood and such more.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_00
 Wood and chrome.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_00
 They like luxurious styles.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_00
 Whereas the young and dynamic.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_00
 They like more soft materials.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_00
 Finger of the teletabits, for instance.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_00
 Soft and fluffy and colorful.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_00
 Well, the shapes are curved and round.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_00
 You get them at the picture.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_00
 And they like sports and gaming.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_00
 And it gives them the vitality.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_03
 So, one little question about the material.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_03
 A soft material for a remote control.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_00
 I'll get to that.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_00
 You'll see.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_00
 First off, let's start with the energy.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_00
 I had a choice between a few different sources.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_00
 But the two basic sources that I found were the best possible with a battery versus kinetic.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_00
 When you move something, it gets energy.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_00
 I figured, well, that's kind of high-tech.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_00
 When you have a remote control, when you pick it up, it has power.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_00
 That would be actually very nice.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_00
 I figured, but we could also use a battery that's better.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_01
 When the power gets low, you have to shake it or something.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you just have to shake it around.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_00
 Then it has some more energy.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_00
 So, you could just go for a battery or you could go for both.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_04
 Have you considered the option of using the solar panel?

0:04:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I actually did.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_00
 But the thing is about solar panels.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_00
 You have to have light.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_00
 Some light preferably.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_00
 You could use normal light, but you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_00
 So, ultimate use of a solar panel.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_00
 You could use solar panels.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_00
 But you have to implement them into the remote control, leaving you a bit less space for the interface.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_00
 So, what's actually, I figured that, well, seeing that you'll always be within the distance of TV.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_00
 From the TV, there comes a whole bunch of light.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_00
 So, it would actually power itself from the TV, but you would just take up all the space and you wouldn't have the full amount of power actually used.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_00
 So, prefer a kinetic?

0:05:57	SPEAKER_00
 I prefer a kinetic, because it's, well, the costs aren't that much higher.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_00
 And it's just a bit more high-tech than a normal battery.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, if you don't move a remote control.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_00
 Well, you pick it up and you press buttons and...

0:06:13	SPEAKER_03
 That's enough to keep the energy level...

0:06:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, well, actually it is.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_00
 And if it isn't, you just shake it a bit.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_00
 And it would power up again.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_00
 But like I said, you could use a battery that you just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_00
 And for rest, you just use all the battery.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_01
 And when the battery doesn't work, I usually shake it too.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly. Exactly. Thank you, Tim.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_00
 Furthermore, we checked the cases.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_00
 We have different options concerning the cases here.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_00
 You simply add a basic standard model.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_00
 It was kind of square and I figured that was a bit boring.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_00
 So, you could go for the single curve or the double curve.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_00
 Single curve, it's just a nice curve.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_00
 But you could go in a double curve.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_00
 And that's several different dimensions.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_00
 That gives you a whole new...

0:07:13	SPEAKER_03
 Dynamic loop.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that gives you a younger and more high-tech look, I figured.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_00
 But we'll discuss later.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_01
 Are you going to draw it?

0:07:24	SPEAKER_00
 What?

0:07:25	SPEAKER_00
 One meter draw.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_00
 In 3D.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_00
 I can't imagine.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I could show you.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_00
 Well, let's say you...

0:07:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_00
 Let's say that's your standard design.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_00
 That's a bit your standard design.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_00
 But you could actually go like something like this.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_00
 And then in 3D effect you could go.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_00
 So, you just...

0:08:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, this is a bit difficult to even.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_00
 I didn't take a major in art.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_00
 But you could have a whole new, the back.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_00
 The depth you could just play around a bit.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_00
 You don't have to use standard...

0:08:23	SPEAKER_03
 A little artistic.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you could at least move space for creativity.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_00
 It might be an idea, but...

0:08:31	SPEAKER_00
 Well, for the more...

0:08:33	SPEAKER_00
 Well, plastic versus rubber, we could choose what's better, plastic or rubber.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_00
 I prefer rubber because it feels...

0:08:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's soft.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's soft and...

0:08:44	SPEAKER_00
 I like soft people.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, plastic also has that cheap feeling to it.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_00
 I usually associate plastic with something as cheap.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_00
 That's maybe just me.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_00
 We could talk about it later.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_00
 For the more buttons, traditional or touch screen, well, we discussed it in a previous meeting.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_00
 So, I figured, just leave it at LCD.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_00
 And chipset.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if we are going to use traditional buttons, we could go with a simple chipset.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_00
 But if we decide to go on an LCD screen, we would use an advanced chipset and that would bring the necessary cost source with it.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_00
 So, that's something we have to keep in mind.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_00
 If it isn't a manageable budget wife, we'd have to go off to simple buttons.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think we're going to sell 10 millions of them.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_01
 So, I bet a big company in Korea or Taiwan, like Samsung, engavers a big discount on the chipset.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, probably.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 Usually chips are more expensive than one dollar.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, probably, but so.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_00
 But, yeah, that shouldn't be a real issue.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_00
 That shouldn't be that big issue.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I just had a...

0:10:11	SPEAKER_00
 I put in big summaries, we could discuss it a bit.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_00
 What are your ideas when concerning battery versus kinetic?

0:10:20	SPEAKER_04
 I think you should use kinetic as a backup.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, combination.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_00
 Combination, right?

0:10:26	SPEAKER_00
 You used battery and charged it up with kinetic.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_00
 When you pick it up, it charges up.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_01
 Like an acu.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_01
 Acu.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_03
 Just like the wire from Saika.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, exactly.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_00
 What do you think?

0:10:41	SPEAKER_03
 I prefer both to combine them.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that would bring some more cash, but I mean...

0:10:53	SPEAKER_00
 Who cares, right?

0:10:55	SPEAKER_00
 That's the project manager's problem.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_04
 Of course, battery in.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_00
 50 cents.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_00
 Well, and then we have single-curve versus double-curve.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, maybe I have something in my presentation to...

0:11:11	SPEAKER_00
 Good, but then.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, now we'll just wait and...

0:11:14	SPEAKER_00
 Plastic versus rubber?

0:11:16	SPEAKER_00
 Rubber.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_04
 Rubber, isn't it possible to make combination what kind of rubber?

0:11:21	SPEAKER_04
 It's all bendable, we move, so you've got to sit there around.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, I figured it would be rather hard.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_00
 Rubber, this is an occasion, yeah.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_00
 Rubber casing, because if you use a touch screen, it's just the casing around it, so you could go for plastic, but I figured...

0:11:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_00
 I would choose rubber.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe I can ask it right now, the question that I have, is it possible if it's necessary to make a touch screen square?

0:11:50	SPEAKER_04
 It is, and I think, yeah.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_01
 I think that the touch screens are generally square, but it's the case you put around it that makes a shape.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, maybe we can do it.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, but if you have a square LCD screen, you put a case around it that has like bulbs or...

0:12:11	SPEAKER_01
 That covers part of the LCD screen.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that would solve custom-isable.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, I get it.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_00
 So, one of the opinions, rubber or plastic, I prefer rubber.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 Me too.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_00
 You too?

0:12:27	SPEAKER_00
 You sure?

0:12:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it has a bit.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_04
 As long as it's firm, and you don't...

0:12:32	SPEAKER_04
 It's not bendable or something, I think that goes too far.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it shouldn't flop over when you hold it.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_00
 No, that's...

0:12:41	SPEAKER_00
 That's the chipset that will hold it firm in place, and an LCD screen will...

0:12:47	SPEAKER_04
 Might even bounce back when you drop it.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it might.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_00
 Traditional versus LCD wire figured we're all set on that.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_00
 And then also the simple versus advanced.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_00
 I figure if we go for LCD, we should have the advanced.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_00
 So that shouldn't be a problem.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well, that's my...

0:13:08	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_01
 Welcome.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_01
 Can I do anything?

0:13:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, do your thing.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_01
 Bringing it on.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_01
 Expert map.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, last week...

0:13:28	SPEAKER_01
 I went to Paris and Milan, a professional trans-watching, from marketing, our research and development department, and I, went to Paris and Milan.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 In Paris and Milan, we asked different people, differing in age and in income, the amount of money to spend.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_01
 What they like in design and material nowadays.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_01
 Findings.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_01
 Our main audience, so that's people below 40, prefer the following.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_01
 At first, the colors of fruit, very basic colors like Janus explained.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_01
 Fresh colors, green, red, strawberry, red, yellow, banana, yellow.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_01
 Considering material, yeah, they like spongy material, like spongy, like a soft material.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_01
 Janus mentioned it also.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_01
 I think he did some findings himself.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_01
 You were in Paris.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_01
 Like this.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_01
 Like big, flashy colors, fresh.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_01
 It's nice, I think.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, our secondary audience, people above 40, 40 years in age, they like the dark, traditional colors.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, materials like wood.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, wood is not a material you build every mocton trollar.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, you could.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_01
 No, you could.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but just a wood and a cake.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_01
 Like you have those fake panels on the floor, but that isn't wood anyway.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_01
 But that's our secondary audience.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_01
 We decided to take, yeah, the people below 40.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_01
 This doesn't apply.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, the third.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_01
 There are some overall thoughts about new remote controls.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_01
 They have to look fancy.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_01
 They should be technological, innovative.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_01
 They should be fancy things in.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_01
 And easy to use.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_01
 But that's common.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_01
 My personal preferences.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_01
 We have to aim at our main audience and therefore use fresh colors.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_03
 Would you prefer, did you choose the color of your remote control?

0:16:29	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I'll come to that in a second moment.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_01
 I think about removable covers as he mobile telephone market to customize your own remote control.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_01
 Like the Nokia, the removable covers just put a red on it and go to shop and buy green one.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_01
 A third.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_01
 Material being used could well be stuff like rubber.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_01
 Do advantages.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_01
 It fits within the current market trends and it adds safety to your remote when you drop it.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_01
 So to come back to your question, I think, and the people in Milan and Paris also think that the rubber should be pretty hard, like seen on regular mobile phones.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_01
 Actually, they have a lot in common,

0:17:22	SPEAKER_00
 phones and... Well, I actually saw a phone that could use this remote.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, maybe you could use your remote at the phone.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_00
 Hey!

0:17:30	SPEAKER_01
 Let me make the next step.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, exactly.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_01
 And my second sheet of personal preferences.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_01
 We have to reconsider the speech function recognition.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_01
 It's very innovative.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_01
 So that you say,

0:17:46	SPEAKER_02
 SPSS, and it goes to...

0:17:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, like something.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_01
 You can see that a market is just screaming for new technologies like speech recognition and stuff, but we have to keep the costs in mind.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_01
 About 50 years.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it can be very expensive.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, second, building games like Snake or Tetris.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_01
 I'm using the younger users.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_01
 Also, the link with mobile phones.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but you don't use that games when you're watching television.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_03
 No, but...

0:18:19	SPEAKER_01
 No, okay.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_01
 But you don't use games when you're making a telephone call.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_01
 It's just the same.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_04
 When your parents are watching some boring program, you can take a remote and do something else.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_01
 When you're at college.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_00
 You take your remote to a school.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_01
 You also take...

0:18:37	SPEAKER_01
 You take your iPad and go play games.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I do that.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, and...

0:18:46	SPEAKER_01
 At third, I stick with it.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_01
 The login functionality.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_01
 With the slogan, take parents to control through a new dimension.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_05
 Very nice.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, so...

0:19:00	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, great, really.

0:19:21	None
 Okay.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_04
 You interface contents.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it's just simple PowerPoint markup.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_04
 I want to make it more dynamic for you so I'll do it there.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_04
 But the main concept is...

0:19:47	SPEAKER_04
 Take one big touch screen.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_04
 Always display the primary buttons, clear and visible.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe even like this with uses of a lot of space.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_04
 And make the menu structure changeables.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_04
 Where if you press system...

0:20:07	SPEAKER_04
 Well, multiple system options can maybe five or ten or one can fit in.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_04
 Or maybe even a step further when you want to...

0:20:18	SPEAKER_04
 Have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_04
 And other buttons can maybe display it here if that's necessary.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_04
 And well, how do we want to look?

0:20:33	SPEAKER_04
 That's a remote look.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_04
 Well, you've got to hold it in one hand.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_04
 So the middle like all remotes have to be a little bit small.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_04
 So you can put it inside your hands.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_04
 And some remotes you can use with a thumb.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_04
 But I think that's too difficult for this one.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_04
 So you can make it a little broader here and here.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_04
 And maybe use your thumb on the main buttons.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_04
 And use your other hands on the menu structure.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_04
 So here are going to be the program buttons, one, two, three, four, etc.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_04
 And the volume control and program control maybe.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_04
 And down here...

0:21:23	SPEAKER_04
 Well, yeah, this could be one big LCD menu structure.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_04
 So you can use it in this way.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_04
 One thing you've got to keep in mind, keep the remote clear of too much function at the same time.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_04
 Know that if you are changing the menu structure here, and well, I still believe you should keep displaying the buttons.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_04
 But if you're programming the caller of the TV, do not display 20 other options that are possible.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_04
 Keep it as simple as possible.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_04
 And do not use too many levels.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_04
 Do not have to select screen first and then brightness and then caller and on plus and on push plus 20 times.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_04
 But just need just in one button if possible.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_04
 And well, in all known TV levels channel one, two.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_04
 And when you get to 10 and want to go back, well, you have a problem.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_04
 You just must move more into the TV, you press 10 and you go to 10 and not to 1 and 0 after that.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_04
 So the button less.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_04
 And things like teletext, put them in the menu, things like...

0:22:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_01
 What do you think about it back and forth come up?

0:22:50	SPEAKER_01
 Buttons, yeah.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_04
 Like an internet tech plan.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_04
 Trying to tell it is volume plus and minus.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_04
 And this is program plus and minus.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, but that is for going from 4 to 5.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_01
 But if you go from 2 to 8.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, you're watching 2U sports on 17.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_04
 And your wife is watching you can switch.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_04
 Switch easy.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_04
 Well, yes, I think that's a good idea.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_04
 But well, my friends would be put it in the menu.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_04
 And if you are using that button a lot of times, well, of course, that menu will still be displayed on the screen.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_04
 You just don't have to play games in between.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_04
 But if you're really switching between 2 channels, you won't have time to use the other options.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, well, I already told that.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_04
 That's why I conclude.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_03
 I think we can discuss a little about the three kind of revolutionary things Tim came with.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_03
 The parental control games and the voice recognition.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_03
 There's not too much decision on that one.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_03
 So I think the parental control is a good function to put in the remote.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know how you think about it.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_04
 There are all the languages put it in the menu structures somewhere.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but properties and parents are comfortable.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_01
 How I see it is you put it on the remote.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_01
 And then you have like windows, log on screen with parents, children, something like that.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_01
 When you want to use a parents option, it has to be fast.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_04
 You don't want to go down and watch the news at 8 o'clock and turn it on.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_04
 Wait 20 seconds for the log on screen and remember your code.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_03
 But I think most people find it much more important that their children don't watch sexual violence on the television.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_03
 Wait 10 or 15 seconds longer so they can finally watch it because they use like with their XB simple log on the address.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_04
 Push parents and if you push parents then you have to log in.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_01
 Go to three digits and a few log in like two on three and it's in.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_04
 And if you push children you don't have to log in.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if it's worth the time and effort we're going to spend on it.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it's a simple function but it's going to take a lot of resources and a lot of time into programming because you'll have to start working with the profiles and such.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_00
 And I'm not sure if it's actually worth investing that much time and effort into it.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think there's big markets for it because you read many times in magazines and stuff and you read on the news that.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_03
 They believe that children are influenced by television and well we're aiming to below 40 years.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_03
 But there are a lot of people below 40 who have children in young age who want them to not watch violent or anything.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_04
 Well, maybe some idea on that.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_04
 Just make the remote as it is.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_04
 But make an option to insert profiles because if my granddad would buy this remote he wouldn't want to bother with all the things to do.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_04
 Make it an option in the menu and install profiles or something.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_03
 That's a better idea.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_01
 It just has to be when it's delivered out of the store.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_01
 It has to be just simple and plain.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_01
 If you want to install it personally.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_01
 If I got kids and I could choose between two remote controls, one with parents controlling one without and I would buy the one with.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_04
 I still have some questions about how to incorporate it.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_04
 I'm thinking about some channels they cannot see but well when I think you have all the standard channels and only maybe after 10 o'clock in the evening, films and movies will come.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe some timing will be instead of channels because if you're watching I don't know.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_04
 Or in a day cartoons will come up maybe Friday night.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it can work with show view.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_03
 You can control your video recorder with show view.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_03
 When you take in the number it will start and end recording but maybe there's some option that.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_03
 The kind of show view numbers are violent and that they are blocked out.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_04
 Sometimes you have a phone and you have a phone that says someone who has sent all the show view numbers on the program.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_04
 But they do the remote and that's all.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_01
 They have a day that isn't possible.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_00
 Well if you want to incorporate the parental control, let's say we do.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_00
 What if a child goes up to the TV and presses up for instance?

0:28:46	SPEAKER_00
 Nobody is stopping a child from checking the channel.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_04
 Well you could say if a parental control is only it will go from 14 to 16 with that bad job.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_00
 Well I'm not sure because for that to happen you'll have to receive a signal from the remote control.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_00
 So it would be a constant signaling.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_00
 What may be better is to incorporate a separate device that you can program with the remote control.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_00
 And that provides parental control for instance.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_00
 And that's just an optional device.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_00
 Besides the remote control you will have a separate.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_03
 I wouldn't put an optional device and that it becomes too much I think.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_03
 If we do it we will do it in a kind of way he said like profile, parent profile, family profile.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_01
 And you know when you install another device children can still go up to the TV, pop open the thing and.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah that's true but in the same instant same happens when you have remote control.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_00
 The only difference is the people buying the remote control will now get the added feature of parental control.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_00
 And those people wouldn't necessarily want it.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah okay.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_01
 But it's just an added future.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_03
 Okay and what do you guys think of the games in the FOIS recognition?

0:30:19	SPEAKER_03
 I personally think that that becomes too much.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_04
 Well yeah it's more like a gadget of functionality.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_04
 Email to from management that it's very popular to use FOIS recognition.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_04
 But I don't think when you're watching TV and hearing loud noises from TV someone screaming, ah one and you're still chatting with each other.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah like FOIS recognition is too much I think.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_01
 In games?

0:30:43	SPEAKER_01
 I games.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_04
 I can see games I can't put it on the chip anyway so.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_04
 That doesn't it's a primary feature of the remote.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_03
 So that will that must be in it you think.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah that will be nice.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay so the games are in it the FOIS recognition are not and the parental control are optional.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah it's in it but how do we do it?

0:31:12	SPEAKER_04
 I think so.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_04
 Well I think also it's a good idea but it's very difficult to incorporate so we should make it to complex.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_04
 So some manual function you choose parental control and maybe FOIS will emerge when you put it on.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_04
 But how it's going to work?

0:31:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah but will there like the first idea from you can buy it without a wet parental control?

0:31:41	SPEAKER_03
 Or are we going to put it in and just?

0:31:44	SPEAKER_04
 I think best would be to put it in and make it in the menu option.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah to put it in always.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah and you can just when you buy it you can select the personal preference, parental control, home and capacity or something.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_00
 Well I don't know if you had two different remote you could choose one with receiver in it.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_00
 So you could actually easily build in parental control but it would be more expensive.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_00
 So in that way you could make cheap moral and expensive moral.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_00
 Could we make the simple moral, do you like moral for instance?

0:32:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah but TVs aren't capable of sending.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yes they are.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah I thought they were just...

0:32:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah you have some to receive.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah but most of them... That is true.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe you just have to restrict it to what program so the parents says you cannot watch channel 7, 9 and 10.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah and you cannot watch all channels after 10 o'clock and there's just some little clock in the middle.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_00
 Well yeah you could easily do that after the market but you still have the problem about the television itself.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_04
 I know it's very simple, I have seen some of the remote who have a clock in it.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_04
 So the remote doesn't transmit when it's off the wall.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_01
 But on the TV at least my TV is a compartment which you can press and there are buttons behind it which you can use.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_04
 If you don't have a pool it's very blunt that's not our problem just have the parents buy it as a glue and it's not part of the remote.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah of course.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah that is true.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah you could go and like that would actually make things a lot more easy.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_00
 You could just buy them on television.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_00
 Make it that problem.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah I figured we could do that.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure what marketing thinks about it but...

0:33:52	SPEAKER_01
 I have to consult my legal at first.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay so I think we have decided on the things that from Janus the energy, the combination between battery and kinetic.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_03
 The case will be double curve and rubber in a flashy fruity color.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_03
 With cover is removable, the buttons will be touchscreen but they may not be too many buttons.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_03
 And in the menu structure there must not be five minutes to go.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_03
 Too many levels and it must be easy to use.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_03
 The parental control will be incorporated but it must be not too complex and the games are in it.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we have a little more.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_01
 Oh I have one thing left.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe for Jerome.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_01
 The fuse.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it's handy to build an expert view and a simple view.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_03
 Like a mode or something.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_04
 The expert view you have in the menu structure when you don't use it is simple.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_04
 And when you do system properties, entire list pops up and all kind of stuff you can pull.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_03
 It's already incorporated a little.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_00
 You could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself for a more advanced user.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_00
 Which buttons do you want to in it?

0:35:34	SPEAKER_00
 You can build in a back forward button and somebody would just want to watch two channels.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_01
 Just leave the other numbers away.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_00
 You could have people want to.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_03
 We take it to the other meeting.

0:35:51	SPEAKER_03
 I went to a master class and two things can come in handy for us.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_03
 The first thing is we talked about knowledge management, knowledge engineering and the fact that the idea of knowledge sharing and learning knowledge from other companies.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_03
 Like that.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_03
 It's very hot at the moment.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_03
 So it's mostly for the management expert to look what other marketing.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_03
 Just talking about my self.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, come on.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_03
 What other companies had also with the marketing campaign when they put on a new remote just some import export?

0:36:44	SPEAKER_03
 And another one?

0:36:45	SPEAKER_03
 Benchmark.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_03
 Benchmark.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_03
 That's the word I saw.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_03
 Another thing is there was a survey and it came out that people like to buy things from a single large provider instead of those who are partnering with us.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_03
 So we must bring it as if a real reaction is a big company, a trust for company.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_01
 I know a marketing name for it.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_01
 R to the third power.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_03
 R3.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_03
 Real reaction remote.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_03
 I had another idea to put the whole idea of a real reaction and a single brand and that kind of thing.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_03
 When you put on the remote you see kind of just like when you're a little...

0:37:41	SPEAKER_03
 Real reaction remote.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_03
 With the motto we put fashion electronics and then you go...

0:37:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, but it has to be like a second because you have to put in a code also.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_04
 You can show somebody a logo for 0.5 seconds.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_04
 They'll still remember it.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_03
 But Linguron every time you see it.

0:38:02	SPEAKER_03
 The idea from this thing is that we must present it as we are a single large provider who will stand on our own.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_00
 If you have the LCD screen you can have a small logo at the bottom and you can just stay there.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_00
 That spins around.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that spins around.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_03
 Also, but we are...

0:38:20	SPEAKER_01
 It's just like a globe.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's a little bit smaller.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_03
 Think about that kind of thing.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_03
 That's what they said in the Masterclass.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_03
 And Shinéva.

0:38:33	SPEAKER_03
 Next meeting starts in 30 minutes.

0:38:36	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe you can go to Paris and Milan.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_01
 What's again?

0:38:40	SPEAKER_01
 Who gave you the Masterclass?

0:38:42	SPEAKER_01
 The Masterclass.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_03
 Ronald Batemburg.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_03
 French Mellars.

0:38:46	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, thanks.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_03
 Very special.

0:38:49	SPEAKER_03
 Next session.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_03
 I did the industrial development session.

0:38:56	SPEAKER_03
 Usually in the face.

0:38:58	SPEAKER_03
 We'll work together on a prototype.

0:39:00	SPEAKER_03
 And we'll drawing it on the smartboard.

0:39:03	SPEAKER_03
 So that's a kind of newer thing.

0:39:05	SPEAKER_03
 And the marketing expert will be keeping busy with the product evaluation.

0:39:14	SPEAKER_03
 But the most specific instructions we sent to you by E-Mem.

0:39:17	SPEAKER_00
 So we're going to work together right now?

0:39:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, this is what I heard.

0:39:23	SPEAKER_03
 The Masterclass.

0:39:25	SPEAKER_03
 Not the Masterclass.

0:39:28	SPEAKER_03
 So you just wait for the specific instructions.

0:39:32	SPEAKER_03
 But I think it was a very good session.

0:39:35	SPEAKER_03
 Gentlemen.

0:39:36	SPEAKER_03
 Definitely.

0:39:37	SPEAKER_04
 No new ones.

0:39:39	SPEAKER_03
 Well, thank you all.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, thank you.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you very much.

0:39:43	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you, too.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_03
 Give me your good evaluation.

0:39:49	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, guys.

0:39:50	SPEAKER_03
 You were success.

0:39:51	SPEAKER_03
 Cheers.

0:39:52	SPEAKER_03
 Cheers.

0:39:53	SPEAKER_03
 See you in a half hour.

0:39:56	SPEAKER_03
 But keep an eye on your left foot.

0:40:00	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure if real, because I saw something about individual actions.

0:40:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but there's still my instructions that you will work together.

0:40:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:40:11	SPEAKER_04
 Here or that's not my problem.
