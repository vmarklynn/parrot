0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 Hello again.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_01
 Hi.

0:00:05	SPEAKER_01
 Hey, Project Manager.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_04
 Project Manager, I'm talking to tell you I have little problems with my laptop.

0:00:12	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:00:13	SPEAKER_04
 So I had a little less time to complete.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_04
 A little problem.

0:00:25	SPEAKER_04
 What was it?

0:00:28	SPEAKER_04
 The laptop, the entire window.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_04
 It's hand.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_04
 Project Manager.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_05
 Your Project Manager.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_01
 Welcome to the conceptual design meeting for real reaction.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_03
 Hello again.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_03
 It's the same as the last time.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_03
 Also this time there will be three presentations.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_03
 And we must reach the decision on the remote control concepts.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_03
 And at the end, when I finish it off, I have some info from a computer.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_03
 I'm from a master class.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_02
 Master.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_01
 Master.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_03
 The concepts where we must reach the decision on are from two sorts.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_03
 Component concepts and user interface concepts.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_03
 The first one is really about the total package with the, well, we have decided to do it with the touch screen.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_03
 But there must be a case around it, so it won't be as breakable.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_03
 How about the energy?

0:02:11	SPEAKER_03
 The interface concept with the type and the supplements were to put one button.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_03
 And I would say yes, can you begin?

0:02:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sure.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_03
 At the end, I will take notes.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_03
 At the end, the minutes will be at the shared corner.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_00
 And let me see.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_00
 I'll be talking about the components.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_00
 What I did was I reviewed previously used items by two different age groups below 45 and above.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_00
 And I just watched what the differences are.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_00
 I checked what to do we want and how can we aim at the target group.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_00
 Well, what I found was that a senior citizen, sorry, it's okay.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_00
 They like the traditional materials like wood and such more, wood and chrome.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_00
 And they like straightforward shapes.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_00
 They like luxurious styles, whereas the young and dynamic, they like more soft materials, think of the tilly-tilly-tobish, for instance, soft and fluffy and colorful.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_00
 Well, shapes are curved and round.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_00
 You get to have the picture.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_00
 And they like sports and gaming and it gives them vitality.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_03
 So, well, one little question about the material, a soft material for remote control.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_00
 No, I'll get to that.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_00
 You'll see.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_00
 First off, let's start with the energy.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_00
 I had a choice between a few different sources.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_00
 But the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery versus kinetic.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_00
 When you move something, it gets energy.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_00
 I figured, well, that's kind of high-tech.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_00
 When you have any melt control, when you pick it up, it has power.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_00
 That would be actually very nice.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_00
 I figured.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_00
 We could also use a battery that's a bit...

0:04:44	SPEAKER_01
 When the power gets low, you have to shake it.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you just have to shake it around a bit.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_00
 And then it has some more energy.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, you could just go for a battery or you could go for both.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_04
 Have you considered the option of using a solar panel?

0:04:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I actually did.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_00
 But the thing is about solar panels, you have to have light.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_00
 Some light preferably.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_00
 You could use normal light, but you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_00
 So, ultimate use of solar panels.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_00
 You could use solar panels, but you'd have to implement them into the remote control, leaving you a bit less space for the interface.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_00
 So, what's actually, I figured that seeing that you'll always be within the distance of TV from the TV comes a whole bunch of light.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_00
 So, it would actually power itself from the TV, but you would just take up all the space and you wouldn't have the full amount of power actually used.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_00
 But you prefer kinetic.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_00
 I prefer kinetic because it's...

0:05:59	SPEAKER_00
 Well, the costs aren't that much higher.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_00
 And it's just a bit more high-tech than a normal battery.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, if you don't move a remote, it could not.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_00
 No, but...

0:06:10	SPEAKER_00
 So, you pick it up and you press buttons and...

0:06:13	SPEAKER_03
 That's enough to keep the energy level...

0:06:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, well, actually it is.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_00
 And if it isn't, you just shake it a bit and...

0:06:21	SPEAKER_00
 And it would power up again.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_00
 But like I said, you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_00
 And for us, you'd just juice it on the battery.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_01
 And when the battery doesn't work, I usually shake it too.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_01
 I slam it on it.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you, Tim.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_00
 Furthermore, you check the cases.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_00
 We have different options concerning the cases.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_00
 You simply add a basic standard model that was kind of square and I figured that's a bit boring.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_00
 So, you could go for the single curve or the double curve.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_00
 A single curve, it's just a nice curve.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_00
 But you could go in a double curve and that's like several different dimensions.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_00
 That gives you a whole new...

0:07:13	SPEAKER_03
 Dynamic loop.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that gives you a younger and more high-tech look, I figured.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_00
 We'll discuss later.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_01
 Are you going to draw it?

0:07:23	SPEAKER_00
 What?

0:07:24	SPEAKER_00
 Do you want me to draw?

0:07:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_00
 In 3D.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_00
 I can't imagine.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I could show you.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_00
 I could show you.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_00
 Well, let's say you...

0:07:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_00
 Let's say that's your standard...

0:07:43	SPEAKER_01
 Design?

0:07:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_00
 That's a bit your standard design.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_00
 But you could actually go like something like this.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_00
 And then in 3D effect you could go...

0:08:06	SPEAKER_00
 So you just...

0:08:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, this is a bit difficult to him.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_00
 I didn't take a major in art.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_00
 But you could have a whole new back.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_00
 The depth you could just play around a bit with.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_00
 You don't have to use standard...

0:08:23	SPEAKER_03
 A little artistic.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it leaves more space for creativity.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_00
 It might be an idea, but just...

0:08:32	SPEAKER_00
 Well, plastic versus rubber, we could choose what's better.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_00
 Plastic or rubber.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_00
 I prefer rubber because it feels...

0:08:41	SPEAKER_00
 It's soft.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's soft.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_00
 I like soft.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_00
 You're from people, aren't they?

0:08:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_00
 Plastic also has a cheap feeling to it.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_00
 Plastic... I usually associate plastic with something as cheap.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe just me.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_00
 We could talk about a layer.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_00
 Furthermore, buttons, traditional touch screen.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we discussed it in a previous meeting.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_00
 So I figured just leave it at LCD.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_00
 And chipset.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if we are going to use traditional buttons, we could go with a simple chipset.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_00
 But if we decide to go on an LCD screen, we would use an advanced chipset, and that would bring the necessary cost with it.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_00
 So that's something we have to keep in mind.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_00
 If it isn't manageable budget-wise, we'd have to go off to simple buttons.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think we're going to sell 10 millions of them.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_01
 So I bet a big company in Korea or Taiwan, like Samsung, think of a big discount on chips.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, probably.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 Usually chips aren't more expensive than $1.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, probably.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_00
 But yeah, that shouldn't be a real issue.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_00
 That shouldn't be that big issue.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_00
 I just had a... I put a big summary here, so we could discuss it a bit.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_00
 What are your ideas when concerning battery versus kinetic?

0:10:20	SPEAKER_04
 I think you should use kinetic as a backup.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, combination.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, combination.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_00
 You use the best thing and charge it up with kinetic.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_00
 When you pick it up, it charges up.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_01
 Like an...

0:10:32	SPEAKER_01
 Acu...

0:10:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_03
 Just like the watch from Saika.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, exactly.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_00
 What do you think?

0:10:42	SPEAKER_03
 I would prefer both to combine them.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that would bring some more cost, but...

0:10:52	SPEAKER_00
 I mean...

0:10:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, right?

0:10:55	SPEAKER_00
 That's the project manager's problem too.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_04
 Fifty-cent.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_04
 Of course.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_00
 Fifty-cent.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_00
 And then we have single curve versus double curve.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe I have something in my presentation to...

0:11:11	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_00
 No, we'll just wait.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_00
 Plastic versus rubber.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_00
 Rubber.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_04
 Rubber.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_04
 Isn't it possible to make combination what kind of rubber is?

0:11:21	SPEAKER_04
 It's an abandoned ball, so you've got to sit there around.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_00
 I figured it would be rather hard.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_00
 Rubber casing.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_00
 This is a casing, yeah.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_00
 Rubber casing because...

0:11:31	SPEAKER_00
 Or if you're using a touch screen, it's just a casing around it.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_00
 You could go for plastic, but I figured...

0:11:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_00
 I would choose rubber.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe I can ask it right now, the question that I have.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_04
 Is it possible...

0:11:47	SPEAKER_04
 Is it necessary to make a touch screen square?

0:11:50	SPEAKER_04
 It isn't, I think.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_01
 I think touch screens are generally square.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_01
 But it's the case you put around it that makes it shape.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_04
 Especially in the trunnies.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_04
 No, maybe we can...

0:12:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay, but if you have a square LCD screen, you put a case around it that has bulbs or that covers part of the LCD screen.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that would solve...

0:12:15	SPEAKER_00
 That would solve...

0:12:16	SPEAKER_00
 Customizable.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, I guess.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_00
 So, what are the opinions?

0:12:22	SPEAKER_00
 Rubber or plastic?

0:12:23	SPEAKER_00
 I prefer rubber.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_00
 Me too.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 Me too.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you too.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_00
 You sure?

0:12:28	SPEAKER_04
 You seem to hesitate a bit.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_04
 As long as it's firm and you don't...

0:12:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_04
 It's not bendable or something.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_04
 I think that goes too far.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it shouldn't flop over when you hold it.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no, no, no.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_00
 That's...

0:12:42	SPEAKER_00
 The chipset will hold it from place and the LCD screen will...

0:12:46	SPEAKER_04
 I think it bows back where you'd drop the...

0:12:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it might.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_00
 Traditional versus LCD, well, I figured we all...

0:12:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_00
 And then also the simple versus advanced.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_00
 I figure if we go for LCD, we should have the advanced.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_00
 So that shouldn't be a problem.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well, that's my...

0:13:07	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_01
 You're welcome.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_01
 Can I do my thing?

0:13:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_01
 Do your thing.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_01
 Bring it on.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_01
 Expert map.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_01
 Last week.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_01
 I went to Paris and Milan, which I'm trans-watching, from marketing.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 Our research and development department and I went to Paris and Milan.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 In Paris and Milan, we asked different people differing in age and in income, the amount of money to spend.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_01
 What they like in design and material nowadays.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_01
 Findings.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_01
 Our main audience, so that's people below 40, prefer the following.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_01
 At first, the colors of fruit, very basic colors, like Jana's explained.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_01
 Fresh colors, green, red, strawberry, red, yellow, banana, yellow.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_01
 Considering material, they like spongy material, like in a sponge bar, like soft material.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_01
 Jana mentioned it also.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_01
 I think he did some findings himself.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_01
 You were in Paris.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_01
 Like this.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_01
 Like big fleshy colors.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_01
 Fresh.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_01
 It's nice, I think.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_01
 Our secondary audience, people above 40 years in age, they like the dark traditional colors.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_01
 Materials like wood.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_02
 Not a material which will build a remote controller.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, you could.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_01
 You could.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but never seen.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_01
 No, okay, but just a wooden, okay.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_01
 Look.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_01
 Like you have those fake panels on the floor.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_01
 That isn't wood anyway.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_01
 But that's our secondary audience.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_01
 So we decided to take the people below 40.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_01
 That doesn't apply.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, the third.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_01
 There are some overall thoughts about new remote controls.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_01
 They have to look fancy.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_01
 They should be technological innovative.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_01
 That means they have to be fancy things in and easy to use, but that's common.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_01
 My personal preferences.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_01
 We have to aim at our main audience and therefore use fresh colors.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_03
 Would you prefer that you can choose the color of your remote control?

0:16:29	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I'll come to that in a second point.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, think about removable covers as you know, a mobile telephone market, customize your own remote control.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_01
 Like the Nokia, the removable covers, just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_01
 A third material being used could well be stuff like rubber.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_01
 Two advantages.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_01
 It fits within the current market trends and it adds safety to your remote when you drop it.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_01
 So to come back to your question, I think any people in Milan and Paris also think that the rubber should be pretty hard.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_01
 Like seeing on regular mobile phones.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_01
 Actually, they have a lot in common.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, it's all a phone that you could use in your remote.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you could use your remote as a phone.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_01
 That'd be a next step.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_01
 Exactly.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_01
 My second sheet of personal preferences.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_01
 We have to reconsider the speech function recognition.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_01
 It's very innovative.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_02
 So that you say SPSS and it goes through?

0:17:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, like something.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_01
 You can see that a market is just screaming for new technologies like speech recognition and stuff.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_01
 But we have to keep the cost in mind.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_01
 Well, 50 years.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_01
 It can be very expensive.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, second, building games like Snake or Tetris.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_03
 Also, the link with mobile phones.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but you don't use the games when you're watching television.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_01
 No, okay.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_01
 But you don't use games when you're making a telephone call.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_01
 It's just the same.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_04
 When your parents are watching some boring program, you can take your remote and do something else.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_01
 When you're at college.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_00
 You can take your remote to school.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_01
 You also take your iPad and go play games.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I do that.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, and at third, I stick with it.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_01
 The login functionality with the slogan, take parental control to a new dimension.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_05
 Very nice.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, so great.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_04
 You interface content.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it's just a simple PowerPoint markup.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_04
 I want to make it more dynamic for you, so I'll draw there.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_04
 But the main concept is take one big touch screen.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_04
 Always display the primary buttons, clear and visible.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe even like this with uses of a lot of space.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_04
 And make the menu structure changeable.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_04
 So if you press system, yeah, well, multiple system options can maybe five or ten or one can fit in.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_04
 Or maybe even a step further when you want to have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_04
 Other buttons can maybe display it here if that's necessary.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_04
 Well, how do we want to look at?

0:20:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's a remote look.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_04
 Well, you've got to hold it in one hand.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_04
 So the middle, like all remotes have to be a little bit small so you can put it in inside your hands.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_04
 And some remotes you can use with a thumb, but I think that's too difficult for this one.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_04
 So you can make it a little broader here and here.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_04
 And maybe use your thumb on the main buttons and use your other hand on the menu structure.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_04
 So here are going to be the program buttons, one, two, three, four, etc.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_04
 And the volume control and program control maybe.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_04
 And down here, this could be one big LCD menu structure.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_04
 So you can use it in this way.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_04
 One thing you've got to keep in mind, keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_04
 Note that if you are changing the menu structure here, and well, I still believe you should keep displaying the buttons, but if you're programming the color of the TV, do not display 20 other options that are possible.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_04
 Just keep it as simple as possible.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_04
 And do not use too many levels.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_04
 Do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then color and on plus and on push plus 20 times.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_04
 But just in one button, if possible.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_04
 And well, in all noted TV levels, channel one, two, and when you get to ten and want to go back, well, you have a problem, just most modern TV, you press one, zero and you go to ten and not to one and zero after that.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_04
 So a button less and things like teletext put them in the menu, things like, yeah.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_01
 What do you think about a back and forth club buttons?

0:22:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah, like in the index bar.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_04
 I was trying to tell that it's volume plus and minus and this is program plus a minus.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, but that is for going from four to five.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, but if you go from two to eight to one.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, you're watching two sports on seventeen and your wife is watching.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_04
 You can switch on two easy.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_04
 Well, yes, I think that's a good idea.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_04
 But well, my question is would you be put it in the menu?

0:23:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_04
 And if you're using that button a lot of times, well, of course, that menu will still be displayed on screen.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_04
 You just don't have to play games in between.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_04
 But if you're really switching between two channels, you won't have time to use the other options.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, well, already told that.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_04
 That's why I conclude here.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_03
 I think we can discuss a little about the three kind of revolutionary things Tim came with.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_03
 This parental control games and the voice recognition.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_03
 There's not too much decision on that one.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_03
 So I think the parental control is a good function to put in the remote.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know how you think about it.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I agree, just put it in the menu structures somewhere.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but properties and parents.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_01
 What I see, how I see it is you put it on the remote.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_01
 And then you have like a Windows log on screen with parents, children, something like that.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_01
 When you want to use a parents option.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_04
 It has to be fast. You don't want to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_04
 And wait 20 seconds for the log on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I think most people find it much more important that their children don't watch sexual violence on the television.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_03
 And wait 10 or 15 seconds longer so they can finally watch it.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_04
 And then they use like Windows XP simple log on to just push one or two or three.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_04
 And if you push parents then you have to log in, go to three digits and if you log in, like two, one, three.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_01
 And it's in.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_04
 And if you push children, you don't have to automatically go.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_04
 But you can all have children's shadows over there.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if it's worth the time and effort we're going to spend on it because it's a simple function but it's going to take a lot of resources and a lot of time into programming because you'll have to start working with profiles and such.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_00
 And I'm not sure if it's actually worth investing that much time and effort into it.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I think that there's big markets for it because you're in many times in magazines and stuff and you're in the news that they believe that children are influenced by television and we're aiming to below 40 years.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_03
 But there are a lot of people below 40 who have children in young age who want them to not watch violence or violence.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_04
 Well, maybe some ID on that. Just make the remote as it is.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_04
 But make an option to insert profiles because if my granddad would buy this remote, he wouldn't want to bother with all the obligations and things to do.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_04
 Just make it an option in the menu, install profiles or something.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_03
 That's a better idea.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_01
 It just has to be when it's delivered out of the store.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_01
 It has to be just simple and plain.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_01
 If you want to install a person, if I got kids, I could choose between two remote controls, one with parent control and one without.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_01
 And I would buy the one with.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_04
 I have still some questions I have about how to incorporate it.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_04
 As you were thinking about some channels that you cannot see.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_04
 Well, when I think you have all the standard channels and only maybe after 10 o'clock in the evening, the films and movies will come.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe some timing will be needed instead of channels because if you're watching it, I don't know.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_04
 At day cartoons will come up, maybe Friday night.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it can work with showview.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_03
 You can control your video recorder with showview when you take in the number.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_03
 It will start and end recording.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_03
 But maybe there's some option that the kind of showview numbers are violent and they are blocked out.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_04
 This one just font is just that someone has to send all the showview numbers on the program's day to three modes.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_04
 And it will have to decide.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but that isn't possible.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if we incorporate the parental control, that's how we do it.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_00
 Well, whatever charges go up to the TV and pressures up, for instance.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_00
 Well, nobody stopping the child from checking the channel.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_04
 Well, yeah, you could say if parental control is on, it will go from 14 to 16 with that page up.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, I'm not sure because for that to happen, you'll have to receive a signal from the remote control.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_00
 So it would have to be constant signaling.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_00
 But what maybe better is to incorporate a separate device that you can program with the remote control.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_00
 And that provides parental control, for instance.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_00
 And that's just an optional device.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_00
 So besides the remote control, you'll have a separate...

0:29:28	SPEAKER_03
 I wouldn't put it in an optional device.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_03
 And that it becomes too much, I think.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_03
 If we do it, we must do it in a kind of way, like a parent profile, and other ways.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_01
 And you know, when you install another device, children can still go up to the TV, pop open the thing.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's true.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_00
 But in the same instance, when you have remote control.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, of course.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_00
 But only difference is that people buying the remote control will now get added feature of parental control.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_00
 And those people wouldn't necessarily want it.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it is.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_01
 But it's just an added feature.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, and what do you guys think of the games in the voice recognition?

0:30:19	SPEAKER_03
 I personally think that it becomes too much.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, yeah.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_04
 It's more like it gets you to the functionality.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_04
 Email to from management that it's very popular to use voice recognition.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_04
 But I don't think when you're watching TV and hearing loud noises from the TV, someone screaming, Ah, one! And you're channel smetches.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, like, voice recognition is too much, I think.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, in games?

0:30:43	SPEAKER_01
 In games.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_01
 In those...

0:30:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I can see games happening.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I put it on the chip anyway.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_04
 That doesn't look as good as it is.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_04
 It's a recent primary feature of the remote.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_01
 And that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_03
 So that will... that must be in it, do you think?

0:31:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that would be nice.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_03
 So the games are in it, the voice recognition are not an apparent control or...

0:31:08	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, it's in it, but...

0:31:11	SPEAKER_01
 But how do we do it?

0:31:12	SPEAKER_01
 I think so.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I think also it's a good idea, but it's very difficult to incorporate.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_04
 So we should make it too complex.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_04
 Some manual function, you choose parental control and maybe profiles will emerge when you put it on.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_04
 But how it's going to work?

0:31:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it'll be perfect.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_03
 But will there...

0:31:35	SPEAKER_03
 Like the first idea from... you can buy it without...

0:31:39	SPEAKER_03
 With parental control?

0:31:41	SPEAKER_03
 Or are we going to put it in and just...

0:31:44	SPEAKER_04
 I think best would be to put it in and to make it in the menu option.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, to put it in always.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_04
 And you can just... when you buy it, you can select personal preference and prepare the control home and prepare for it or something.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I don't know. I figured if you had two different remotes, you could choose one with...

0:32:06	SPEAKER_00
 Well, a receiver in it.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_00
 So you could actually easily build in parental control, but it would be more expensive.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_00
 So in that way, you could make cheap model and expensive model.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_00
 You could make the simple model and do large model for instance.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that's it.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but...

0:32:27	SPEAKER_01
 DVs aren't capable of sending.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, they are.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_01
 I thought they were just able to receive it.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, some, but most of them...

0:32:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that is true.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe you just have to restrict it to what program.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_04
 So the parent says you cannot watch channel 7, 9 and 10.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_04
 And you cannot watch all channels after 10 o'clock and just some little clock in the...

0:32:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, you could easily...

0:32:52	SPEAKER_00
 Just some rules.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_00
 You could easily do that with the remote control, but you still have the problem about the television itself.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, no, it's very simple.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_04
 I have seen some of the remotes who have a clock in it.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_04
 So the remote doesn't transmit when it's off the clock.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, okay.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_01
 But on the TV, at least my TV, is a compartment which you can press.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_01
 And there are buttons behind it which you can use.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_01
 If you don't have a...

0:33:20	SPEAKER_04
 Food is very blunt, that's not our problem.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_04
 Just have the parents buy some glue and it's not part of the remote.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, of course.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that is true.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that is true.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you could go...

0:33:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that would actually make things a lot more easy.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_00
 You could just blame it on television.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_00
 Make it that problem.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_00
 I think we could do that.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, sure.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure what marketing thinks about it, but...

0:33:50	SPEAKER_00
 I have to...

0:33:53	SPEAKER_01
...consolve my legal advice.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so I think we have decided on the things that...

0:34:03	SPEAKER_03
 From Janus, the energy, the combination between battery and kinetic.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_03
 The case will be double-curved and rubber in a flashy, fruity color.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_03
 And with cover is removable.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_03
 The buttons will be touchscreen, but there may not be too many buttons.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_03
 And in the menu structure, there must not be five minutes to go.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_03
 Too many levels and it must be easy to use.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_03
 The parental control will be incorporated, but it must be not too complex.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_03
 And the games are in it.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think we have...

0:34:48	SPEAKER_03
 Consensus.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_01
 A little more...

0:34:52	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I have one thing left.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe for Jerome.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_01
 The fuse.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it's handy to build in an expert view and a simple view.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_03
 Like a mode or something.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_01
 Like in an expert view, you have a lot of...

0:35:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, if you have anything...

0:35:12	SPEAKER_04
...thinking about it is just a menu structure when you don't use it.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_04
 It's simple.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_04
 When you put system properties, entire list pops up with...

0:35:20	SPEAKER_04
...all kind of stuff you can put.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_03
 It's already incorporated a little in a concept.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_00
 You could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself for the more advanced users.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_00
 Which buttons do you want to in it?

0:35:34	SPEAKER_00
 Because you can build on the back-forward button and somebody would just want to watch two channels.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_01
 Just leave the other numbers away.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_00
 You could have people want to...

0:35:46	SPEAKER_00
 We take it to the other meeting, okay?

0:35:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_03
 A little chat to do and then we finish.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_03
 I went to a master class and two things can come in handy for us.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_03
 First thing is we talked about knowledge management, knowledge engineering and the fact that the idea of knowledge sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is all like that.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_03
 It's very hot at the moment. So it's mostly for the management expert to look what other marketing...

0:36:20	SPEAKER_03
 Marketing.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_01
 What did I said, management?

0:36:22	SPEAKER_03
 Management.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_03
 Just talking about myself.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's helpful.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_03
 Go on.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_03
 What other companies had to do also with the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote, just some...

0:36:40	SPEAKER_03
...amort expert.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_03
 And another one.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_03
 There are... yeah, benchmarking.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_03
 That's the word I saw.

0:36:49	SPEAKER_03
 I couldn't...

0:36:51	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_03
 Another thing is there was a survey and it came out that people like to buy things from a single large provider instead of those who are partnering with us.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_03
 So we must bring it as if a real reaction is a big company, a trustful company and...

0:37:15	SPEAKER_01
 I know a marketing name for a product.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_01
 R to the third power.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_01
 R3.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_01
 Real reaction remote.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_03
 I had another idea to put the idea of a real reaction and a single brand and that kind of thing.

0:37:34	SPEAKER_03
 When you put on the remote, you see kind of just like when you tell a little animation.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_03
 Real reaction remote.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_03
 And with the motto, we put fashion in electronics.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_03
 And then you go...

0:37:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, but it has to be like a split second because you have to put in a code also.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_04
 You can show somebody a logo for.5 seconds.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_04
 They'll still remember it.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_03
 But lingo on every time you see it.

0:38:02	SPEAKER_03
 The idea from this thing is that we must present it as we are a single large provider who will stand on our own.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_00
 If you have the LCD screen, you can have a small logo at the bottom and you could just stay there.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_00
 That spins around.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that spins around.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_03
 Also, but we are...

0:38:20	SPEAKER_01
 It's just like a globe in the internet.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:38:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:38:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, something like that.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, but the small icon.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_03
 Think about that kind of thing.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_03
 That's what they said in the master club.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_03
 And she never.

0:38:33	SPEAKER_03
 Next meeting starts in 30 minutes.

0:38:36	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe you can go to Paris and Milana.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_01
 What's the game?

0:38:40	SPEAKER_01
 Who gave you the master class?

0:38:41	SPEAKER_01
 The master class.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_01
 Ronald Bathenberg.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_03
 French men, actually.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, thanks.

0:38:47	SPEAKER_03
 Very special.

0:38:49	SPEAKER_03
 Next session.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_03
 ID, the industrial development center.

0:38:57	SPEAKER_03
 We'll work together on a prototype.

0:39:01	SPEAKER_03
 And we'll drawing it on the smart board.

0:39:03	SPEAKER_03
 So that's a kind of new one, I think.

0:39:07	SPEAKER_03
 And the marketing expert will be keeping busy with the product evaluation.

0:39:14	SPEAKER_03
 But the most specific instructions will be sent to you by email.

0:39:17	SPEAKER_00
 So we're going to work together right now?

0:39:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, this is what I heard.

0:39:23	SPEAKER_03
 In the master class.

0:39:28	SPEAKER_03
 So you just wait for the specific instructions.

0:39:32	SPEAKER_03
 But I think it was a very good session.

0:39:35	SPEAKER_03
 Gentlemen.

0:39:36	SPEAKER_03
 Definitely.

0:39:37	SPEAKER_04
 No new.

0:39:38	SPEAKER_04
 Me too.

0:39:39	SPEAKER_03
 Well, thank you all.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, thank you.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:39:43	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you very much.

0:39:44	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you too.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_03
 Give me a good graduation.

0:39:46	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, guys.

0:39:50	SPEAKER_03
 You were a success.

0:39:51	SPEAKER_03
 Cheers.

0:39:52	SPEAKER_03
 See you in a whole hour.

0:39:57	SPEAKER_03
 But keep an eye on your laptop.

0:40:00	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure if we only, because I saw something about individual actions.

0:40:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but there's still my instructions that you will work together.

0:40:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:40:11	SPEAKER_04
 Here?

0:40:12	SPEAKER_04
 That's not my problem.

0:40:13	SPEAKER_03
 Bye bye.

0:40:14	SPEAKER_03
 No, I'm still managing.

0:40:16	SPEAKER_03
 The product manager always works alone.
