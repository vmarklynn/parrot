0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 I'll set.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, cool. Right, so basically I'm just going to go over real quickly some news I just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control and then I'm going to turn it over to you guys to make brief presentations on what you found and then we'll have a bit of discussion.

0:00:22	SPEAKER_02
 So basically I've just found out from the board on if you guys got the females well but it needs to be television only.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_02
 So we're not doing DVD, we're not doing anything else, it's just going to be a television remote.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_02
 It also needs to have the company colors included in it.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_02
 So that's red and black and it has to have the slogan.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_02
 In case you guys forget the slogan it's we put fashion and electronics and no teletext.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do so we don't want to include that in this particular design for reasons that I don't really know.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_02
 But it's the board so there you go.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_02
 So basically given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_02
 I mean because it's television only we will be able to change our well we can sacrifice more function for a better television remote.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_02
 Anyway so I'm going to turn it over to the industrial designer to go ahead and make a presentation.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_01
 So do I unplug?

0:01:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_01
 Are you in this bit here?

0:01:31	None
 Yep.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_02
 Man I have to hit function of it but it looks like it's going to come up.

0:01:45	None
 Okay.

0:01:46	None
 Right.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_01
 That's page one of my presentation.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_01
 So the method we're going to have to understand how remote controls work and it's a successfully complete this project.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_01
 Remote control works as follows.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_01
 It's all pretty basic stuff for you guys.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_01
 Send a message to another system.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_01
 So there's an energy source involved in that like battery or solar power, something along those lines.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_01
 There's an integrated circuit which is the microchip and that actually composed the messages and usually the way a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_01
 User interface controls the chip.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_01
 Basically that's the casing and the buttons and accordingly the messages as well.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_01
 So my findings, I just did a preliminary study here and I found that too much metal and remote design can potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands and too much metal can cause remote to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_01
 Too much metal is used sometimes people pick up radio signals and the like and there's lots of the possibility of remote catching on fire and injuring the customer.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_01
 Just think of those lawsuits.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_01
 That would be really bad.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_01
 Before I suggest primarily plastic construction.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_01
 Components just some ideas that I had, energy source.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_01
 It's kind of hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_01
 User interface, since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_01
 The chip, silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_01
 But we can't really be different in that respect.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_01
 The sender, while I'm thinking infrared cause it is the industry standard multi channel that's the word I made up.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_01
 I don't really know what it means.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_01
 Pal and NTSC compatible and probably a 200 foot range.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_01
 And the receiver of course is a number of electronic devices.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_01
 But in this case, the only VTBs.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_01
 Personal preferences.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_01
 I really think that we should use plastic as a post metal.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_01
 The company is simply kind of Ford.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_01
 This kind of lawsuits.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_01
 Which admittedly is going to come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_01
 Because we were thinking.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_02
 Is there a way that we can use modern types of polymers or modern types of plastics that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value?

0:04:28	SPEAKER_02
 Like if we talk about like on the laptops and other ones that use a pretty nice, you can do is there some kind of nice color, their quality, plastic that we can work with?

0:04:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_01
 For example, the plastic they have in the laptops out there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do.

0:04:47	None
 Great.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_01
 With my presentation.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you very much, Nathan.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_02
 If next week we can have the user interface developer, go ahead and make a brief presentation that would be great as well.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_02
 Let's plug yourself in here.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_02
 It functionerfate real quickly.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_01
 Is it plugged in well?

0:05:40	SPEAKER_01
 There it goes.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_01
 The computer adjusting.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_02
 There you go.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_02
 Sweet.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_00
 Here we have my technical function design presentation.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_00
 So, a few of the requirements we need here.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_00
 We basically need to operate an electronic device.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_00
 It needs to be universal and possibly operate several different types of devices, although we now find that that's for no problem.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_00
 So, some of my findings basically want to send messages to a television set.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_00
 That would be any number of different things such as switch on the television switch to a channel, that sort of thing I think we're all quite intelligent and know what a normal remote control does.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_00
 Now, some of the other things I found is a complicated remote control.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sorry that we can't go back to the camera.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_00
 We might read there very well, but this remote control has many functions.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_00
 So, it can do a lot of things, but it is quite complicated and most users will find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't want to take the time to learn how to do it.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_00
 As you also notice, it's quite a boring design.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_00
 Another remote control, slightly different.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_00
 It's a simple remote control.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_00
 Many less buttons, but has many fewer functions.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_00
 Much easier for the user to manipulate and use.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_00
 It also has a bit of a cheap look and is also quite boring.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_00
 So my personal process is revolutionized the idea of a remote control.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_00
 So attain the functionality of a complicated device, but use a simple format of display for the user to work with.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_00
 Now it's going to add another slide here, but I didn't play half time there.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously, like having multiple face buttons and whatnot.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_02
 Great.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_02
 Thanks for that run.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I love- Yep, that's you.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_03
 I can plug you in.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, that would be perfect.

0:08:05	None
 Thank you.

0:08:06	None
 Slide down.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_03
 Give it a little bit.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_03
 Slide down.

0:08:09	None
 Give it a little bit.

0:08:10	None
 Slide down.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_03
 Give it a little bit.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_02
 Slide down.

0:08:13	None
 Give it a little bit.

0:08:14	None
 Okay.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_03
 So this is me.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_03
 Basically, I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_03
 We had a usability test where we were actually, like watching 100 people use TV remote and see what it is that they're using.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_03
 And then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general TV remote control practices.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_03
 Pretty much through testing, we were finding out that most of the time, everybody's just using changing the channel, turning it on, using the volume, the majority of the time that's all that's going on.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_03
 The other functions happen for some people they're important, but the primary uses are really, really basic.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_03
 And so big, complicated, remote, like we're one who saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_03
 They're not using a lot of it.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_03
 They don't need it.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_03
 They even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons they don't want to do with.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_03
 And we also found out that 50% of our people, the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it and then they can't find it in the room.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_03
 So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something, we're really coming to play with a lot of these people.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_03
 There's also a survey about what they liked about the remote.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_03
 And pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_03
 And the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_03
 That's up to the design people.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_03
 But it is something we're thinking about, especially since the younger demographics are obviously the one that's going to keep growing.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_03
 So if that's the direction we're headed in, it's something to think about.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_03
 But basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice, which are the standards.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_03
 So it's a good start for us.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_02
 That's great.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you, Sarah.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_02
 So yeah, I'll just switch that back here.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_02
 I'll finish up, which is a bit of discussion.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_02
 I will.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_02
 I'll plan on for the next phase.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_02
 So I think we've covered most of these important questions through you guys' presentations.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_02
 We've got the industrial designers who just, or pretty much, infatically suggested that we need to go with plastic.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_02
 Sarah, she's recommended that we go for simpler functions.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_02
 So fewer functions.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_02
 But we need to decide who we're selling this to.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_02
 Your stat suggested that 75% of people under 35 want to thought about voice control.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_02
 So do we want to go for that, or do we want to go for an older demographic?

0:11:14	SPEAKER_02
 And my thought is we've got, if we're going to go for a sleek look, I mean, we are putting the fashion and electronics.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_03
 We're not catering to the pensioners of the world that we'll take.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe this, we should look into this.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_02
 Younger demographic.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_02
 So we need to wonder how we can make it better and smaller and faster.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_02
 We're constrained to plastic very well.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_02
 We've got this idea.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_02
 We're almost saying we need to think about revolutionizing the way it's looking, which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for tele.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_02
 So this voice operation thing is, I think, is a good idea, assuming that it's doable.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_02
 At least for the basic controls, maybe we can balance it that way.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_02
 You know, we can see, okay, you can't say record alias tonight at 7.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_02
 We might be able to say volume up.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_01
 But I think it would be possible to combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, that could work.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_03
 I like that.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_01
 With a simple command like locate.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_01
 And then something very basic.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_01
 It could start to be.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_01
 Or before we found.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_03
 Is that only going to be within our 200 foot range then?

0:12:44	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah, I think that's very doable.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_02
 The difficulty, what would be in, I think, like you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_02
 Can you have something that picks up a voice from far away?

0:12:59	SPEAKER_02
 It's a good point.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_02
 It's hidden under the couch.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_02
 But then again, you have this weathing.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_02
 You know, it's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe that could be always activated too.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 A little sticky pad to stick on top of your television.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a sling in to that.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_02
 Or an isolated magnet or something like, you know, something that wouldn't interfere.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_02
 The technical thing.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah, I like that.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_02
 I like that.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_02
 The voice recognition system.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_00
 The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_00
 So it could be sold to both the younger market, the older market.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_00
 The younger market could use kind of the voice control method.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_00
 The older market might be.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly, and we might consider that all the market could use this in poor design for the traditional buttons and whatnot.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_00
 I was thinking.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_03
 I was thinking about the screen.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_03
 I'll go ahead.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_03
 If we're going to do this touchpad screen thing, do we know if that's an option technically

0:14:00	SPEAKER_00
 right now? Definitely an option.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_00
 I've looked into a cost of touch screen methods and whatnot.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_00
 This seemed to be almost as cheap as a button method at this point.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_03
 It seems like an interesting option, especially because then you could have your primary screen just be these four or five basic functions and you have menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition settings, things that you're not going to use every day and that a lot of people aren't going to use.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_03
 But it is an option there for this high tech market that sort of is this sleek thing we're going for.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_01
 I've got to wonder there for adding so much technology to this one remote.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_01
 I was still going to be able to meet a 1250 euro goal for selling these things.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_01
 It seems like you're not going to be able to handle all those functions with just one microchip.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_01
 The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the whole mechanism.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_01
 It's just something to consider.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_02
 Absolutely.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_02
 Well, yeah, I guess we'll cross that bridge in the later stages of development.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah, no, it's perfectly viable question.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_02
 So I'm seeing that we're going to just basically focus on this young demographic.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_02
 Aim it at them, but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them, but basically will make a sleek, simple function remote control.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_02
 I think this voice recognition thing is we've got a market for it.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think there's too many.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_02
 More or less be cornering the market on as well.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_02
 We don't have many.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_02
 Compared to a lost my microphone.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_02
 We don't have many people.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_02
 There's not very many competitors out there that do that.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 So cool.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_02
 I guess we've touched on most of this.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_02
 I think that I gave a paging function, a touch screen, and face plates.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_02
 The thing with I see, would there not be a, we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure that's sincerely correct.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_00
 I think you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that kind of has a portion of the device is not interchangeable.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_00
 Where is the surrounding portions are interchangeable?

0:16:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_00
 We could have the casing.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_01
 Back to the, the costs, the material.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_01
 We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_01
 That's something.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_01
 If we're say we're including three or four face plates, this can drive the costs up.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_01
 And the other question is, if we don't include them, are we really in a position to evaluate that market?

0:16:49	SPEAKER_01
 We haven't done any tests on face plates.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_01
 And whether, see, there's even interest out there.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_01
 So, the problem ahead, it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, because it would have to, who all, it's not like the cell phones like we have a, you know, Nokia model X and then 10 people make face plates for it.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_02
 We just are a model of remote control.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_03
 One publicity of a face phone is you have it out and around it is sort of emblematic whereas you're just sitting at home, so unless somebody comes over to watch TV.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_00
 Well, hopefully some people have people coming over to watch.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_00
 True.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_00
 And most people have their television in the living room.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we can discuss that one further when we think about whether, when we do costs and so forth, true, plastic is dead cheap.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_02
 And if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway, yeah, cross-aparge later.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah, we will have to evaluate what's most important.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_02
 I think we've had a bit of discussion already on these things.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_02
 So do any other questions, comments that came up in these presentations?

0:17:55	SPEAKER_00
 Well, have we confirmed that we're going to go ahead with a top screen?

0:18:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, okay.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_02
 Um.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think that would be best.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_02
 Let's based on what you guys have all said to me.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_02
 Let's go for a plastic, a plastic case, because that this is easy on the cost.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_02
 Try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_02
 That's a great idea.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_02
 With a touch screen for the basic functions.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_02
 And we'll, yeah, but let's provisionally let's go for a touch screen one with several sub menus for possible extra stuff that won't basically put the channel in the on and off switch on the touch screen.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_02
 Do we have, wait a minute, it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen, people are going to have to recharge their remote controls.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yet, at the same time, that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_03
 So it would have a docking base?

0:19:06	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_02
 Then again, that costs as well.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_00
 So it's new within the last 20 years, even with the touch screen.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_00
 Do that.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_01
 Three or four days.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_03
 And we'll somebody buy it if we tell the day.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I don't think, yeah, I can't see anybody buying a remote control that we have to plug in.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_02
 So we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_02
 So with a touch screen with some kind of, with some cutting edge battery technology.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_00
 For 12 year olds.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, well, hey, it's worth looking into.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_02
 If not, we can always default to just doing a well presented plastic simple.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_02
 You know, well, yeah, I mean, you can put that we could, I don't know, I mean, I suppose we could put the basics on the center, easiest, you know, people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_02
 And then the other bits and bobs, you know, go through many.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_02
 We'll do the aesthetics.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 So look for the touchscreen in the battery.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_02
 Focus on presentation.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_02
 With this voice recognition option as well.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_02
 Just for the simple functions, the on off channels volume.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_02
 And a small paging function, even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging, you know, just some kind of simple button that's just, I guess, another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some kind of paging.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_02
 Just okay.

0:20:45	None
 Right.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_02
 So any comments?

0:20:47	SPEAKER_02
 Thoughts before we break into going to the next round of individual work on this?

0:20:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, we're doing touchscreen.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_01
 We want to look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the, you know, the actual interface part of it and things like that.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_01
 Or is it just going to be one touchscreen for everybody?

0:21:10	SPEAKER_01
 Interesting.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_01
 What would be on that touchscreen?

0:21:14	SPEAKER_01
 Because you said earlier that we have to think about company colors and logo or something or motto.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_01
 I can't remember exactly what you said.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_00
 We put fashion to the electronics.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_02
 It's my understanding that if you're going to do a skin, you need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think perhaps it's too much.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_02
 Good idea, but yeah, I think that that one might just be, yeah, I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_02
 A pda would, that makes a lot of sense for a pda because you're going to be using it to connect up to things anyway.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_02
 But I don't know what you guys think.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_01
 I think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touchscreen.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, be okay.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_00
 I'm in agreement with that.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_00
 I'm wondering how we're going to get, you put fashion into electronics.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_03
 Well, but if we're going to use a touchscreen where it's going to come on, like on your cell phone, it'll have your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading and then it goes away, perhaps it can be like a temporary, it comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it because it is a bit much to have it engraved on the back

0:22:30	SPEAKER_00
 or something. Yeah, true.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I'm hoping for subliminal, maybe half a millisecond as it turns.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, no, it seems like it would suffice to just have the RR on there.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you would think, but.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_02
 Apparently not.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_01
 People are going to want their remote to boot up and see flashing things.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's going to be just going to be on ready to go.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_02
 Well, fair enough.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_02
 Any of that would help the battery life too.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_02
 If the remote, they do have to press about it for their remote to turn on.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_02
 But then again, who wants to turn on or not control?

0:23:05	SPEAKER_00
 Well, you have to do this to turn the screen in on, right?

0:23:08	SPEAKER_00
 It'll wake up.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, I'll go into it back to the dormant mode.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_02
 Go to the remote mode.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah, I like that.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_02
 I like the idea of putting the logo in the boot up screen.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_02
 Nice.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_02
 Cool.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_02
 So any last things before you break?

0:23:27	SPEAKER_02
 All right, fair enough.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_02
 Sounds good.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to save the copy of this.

0:23:31	None
 You guys need to remind us.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to save a copy of this and the main set.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_02
 I'll do it in a second and put them in the share folder for later reference.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 I'll put my files in the share folder.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_02
 Brilliant.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:44	None
 Okay.

0:23:45	None
 Okay.

0:23:46	None
 Okay.

0:23:47	None
 Okay.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_02
 That's fab, guys.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_02
 Cool.
