0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 I'll set.

0:00:03	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, cool.

0:00:05	SPEAKER_02
 Right, so basically I'm just going to go over real quickly some news I just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control, and then I'm going to turn it over to you guys to make brief presentations on what you found, and then we'll have a bit of discussion.

0:00:21	SPEAKER_02
 So basically, I've just found out from the board I don't know if you guys got this email as well, but it needs to be television only.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_02
 So we're not doing DVD, we're not doing anything else, it's just going to be a television remote.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_02
 It also needs to have the company colors included in it.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_02
 So that's red and black, and it has to have the slogan.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_02
 In case you guys forget the slogan, we put fashion in electronics.

0:00:45	SPEAKER_02
 And no teletext.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure what teletext is, but I'm assuming you guys do, so we don't want to include that in this particular design for reasons that I don't really know.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_02
 But it's the board, so there you go.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_02
 So basically, given those guidelines, which we'll have some effect on how we design, we'll discuss it later, I mean, because it's television only, we'll be able to change our well, we can sacrifice more function for a better television remote.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_02
 Anyway, so I'm going to turn it over to the industrial designer to go ahead and make a

0:01:25	SPEAKER_01
 presentation. Okay.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_01
 So do I implode this bit here?

0:01:31	None
 Yep.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_02
 Might have to hit function F8, but it looks like it's going to come up.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_01
 That's page one of my presentation.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_03
 Very nice.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_03
 Pre-first PowerPoint is lovely.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_01
 So the method, we're going to have to understand how remote controls work and we're going to successfully complete this project.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_01
 Remote control works as follows.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_01
 It's all pretty basic stuff, you guys.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_01
 It sends a message to another system, so there's an energy source involved in that, like battery or solar power, something along those lines.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_01
 There's an integrated circuit, just the microchip, and that actually composed the messages, and usually the way a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_01
 User interface controls the chip, basically that's the casing and the buttons, and accordingly, the messages as well.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_01
 So my findings, I just did a preliminary study here, and I found that too much metal in remote design can potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_01
 Too much metal can cause remote to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_01
 Too much metal is used, sometimes people pick up radio signals and the like.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_01
 And there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_01
 I just think of those lawsuits, that would be really bad.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_01
 Therefore, I suggest primarily plastic construction.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_01
 Components, just some ideas that I had, energy source.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_01
 It's kind of hip to be eco-friendly, so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_01
 User interface, since we can't use metal, I was thinking maybe a high-grade recycled plastic.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_01
 The chip, silicon-based chip, I don't really see any way around that, we can't really be different in that respect.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_01
 The sender, while I'm thinking infrared, because it is the industry standard, multi-channel, that's the word I made up, I don't really know what it means.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_01
 Pal and NTSC compatible, and probably a 200-foot range.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_01
 And the receiver, of course, is a number of electronic devices, but in this case, only one of these.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_01
 Personal preferences, I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_01
 The company simply can't afford this kind of lawsuits, which admittedly is going to come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value, because we were thinking.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_02
 Is there a way that we can use modern types of polymers or modern types of plastics that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value?

0:04:27	SPEAKER_02
 Like if we talk about, like, on the laptop, and the other ones we use, that's pretty nice, and you can do, is there some kind of nice color there in quality of plastic that we can work with?

0:04:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_01
 For example, the plastic they have in their laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_02
 Great, thank you very much, Nathan.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_02
 If next we can have the user interface developer, go ahead and make a brief presentation, that would be great as well.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_02
 Just plug yourself in here.

0:05:05	None
 Hit function if they're real quickly, hold down.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_01
 This is plugged in well.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_01
 There it goes, computer adjusting.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_02
 There you go, sweet.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_00
 Well, so here we have my technical function design presentation.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_00
 So a few of the requirements we need here, we basically need to offer an electronic device, it needs to be universal, and it possibly operates several different types of devices, although we now find that.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry, I couldn't get that get to use before.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_00
 So some of my findings basically want to send messages to a television set.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_00
 That would be any number of different things, such as switch on the television, switch to the next channel, that sort of thing, I think we're all quite intelligent and no what a normal remote control does.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_00
 Now, some of the other things I found is a complicated remote control, I'm sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well, but this remote control has many functions.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_00
 So it can do a lot of things, but it is quite complicated and most users will find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't want to take the time to learn how to do it.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_00
 As you also notice, it's quite a boring design.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_00
 Another remote control, slightly different, it's a simple remote control, many less buttons, but has many fewer functions, much easier for the user to manipulate and use.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_00
 It also has a bit of a cheap look and is also quite boring.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_00
 So my personal perspective revolutionized the idea of a remote control.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_00
 So attaining the functionality of the complicated device but use a simple format of display for the user to work with.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_00
 I was going to add another slide here, but I didn't quite have time there.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_00
 Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously, like having multiple faceplates.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_02
 Great, thanks for that Ron.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_03
 I can plug in.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_03
 That would be perfect, thank you.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_03
 Slide your open ready.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_03
 Or not.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_02
 Give it a little bit.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_02
 There we go.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so this is me.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_03
 Basically, I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_03
 We had a usability test where we were actually watching 100 people use TV remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they feel that questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general TV remote control practices.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_03
 Pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time everybody's just using changing the channel, turning it on, using the volume, the majority of the time that's all that's going on.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_03
 The other functions happen for some people, they're important, but the primary uses are really, really basic.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_03
 And so, big complicated remotes, like the one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_03
 They're not using a lot of it.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_03
 They don't need it.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_03
 They even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons they don't know what to do with.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_03
 And we also found out that 50% of our people, the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it and then they can't find it in the room.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think what we were talking about with a pager or something will really come into play with a lot of these people.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_03
 There's also a survey about what they like about the remote and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_03
 And the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically, that's up to the design people, but it is something we're thinking about, especially since the younger demographics is obviously the one that's going to keep growing.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_03
 So, if that's the direction we're headed into something to think about.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_03
 But basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice, which are the standards.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's a good start for us.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_02
 That's great.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you, Sarah.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah, I'll just switch that back here.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_02
 I'll finish up, which is a bit of discussion.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_02
 I'll just go ahead and put that on the panel for the next phase.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_02
 So, I think we've covered most of these important questions through this, through you guys's presentations.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_02
 We've got the industrial designers suggest, or pretty much emphatically suggested that we go with plastic.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_02
 Sarah, she's recommended that we go for simpler functions, so fewer functions.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_02
 But we need to decide who are we selling this to.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_02
 Your stats suggested that 75% of people under 35 want to be thought about voice control.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_02
 So, do we want to go for that, or do we want to go for an older demographic?

0:11:14	SPEAKER_02
 And my thought is, we've got, if we're going to go for a sleek look, I mean, we are putting the fashion and electronics.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_03
 We're not catering to the pensioners of the world, but we don't think so.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_02
 So, maybe this, we should look into this younger demographic.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_02
 So, we need to wonder how we can make it better and smaller and faster.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_02
 We're constrained to plastic very well.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_02
 We've got this idea, Ron, was saying we need to think about revolutionizing the way it's looking, which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for tele.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_02
 So, this voice operation thing is a good idea, assuming that it's doable, at least for the basic controls.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we can balance it that way.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_02
 You know, we can see.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, you can't say record alias tonight, except we might be able to say volume up.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_01
 I think it would be possible to combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, that could work.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_03
 I like that.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_01
 With a simple command like locate.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, something very basic.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_01
 It could start to be right.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_01
 Or be found.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_03
 Is that only going to be within our 200 foot range then?

0:12:44	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah, I think that's right.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_01
 Doable.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_02
 The difficulty, what would be in, I think, you can't speak into the remote that you're trying to find.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_02
 Can you have something that picks up a voice from far away?

0:13:00	SPEAKER_02
 It's a good point.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_02
 It's hidden under the couch.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_02
 But then again, you have this we thing.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_02
 You know, just a little chip or whatever that has the page button.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe that could be voice activated too.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 A little sticky pad to stick on top of your television.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_00
 I need to say slinging to that.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if you can see the lines here.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_02
 Or an isolated magnet or something like, you know, something that wouldn't interfere.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if that's the technical thing.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I like that.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_02
 I like that.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_02
 The voice recognition to the paging system.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_00
 The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of the remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_00
 So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_00
 The younger market could use kind of the voice control method.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_00
 The older market might get it just an option.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_00
 You might consider the older market could use this simpler design for the traditional buttons.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_00
 I was thinking about the screen.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, go ahead.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_03
 The if we're going to do this touchpad screen thing, are we still do we know if that's an option technically right now?

0:14:01	SPEAKER_00
 Definitely an option.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_00
 I've looked into costs of touch screen methods and whatnot.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_00
 They seem to be almost as cheap as a button method at this point.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_03
 It seems like an interesting option, especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these, you know, four or five basic functions and you have menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition settings, things that you're not going to use every day and that a lot of people aren't going to use.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_03
 But it is an option there for this high tech market that sort of be is this leak thing we're going for.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_01
 It's kind of wonder though, for adding so much technology to this one remote, are we still going to be able to meet a 12 or 1250 euro goal for selling these things.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_01
 It seems like you're not going to be able to handle all those functions with just one microchip.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_01
 The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the whole mechanism.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_01
 So it's just something to consider.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_02
 Absolutely.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_02
 Well, yeah, I guess we'll cross that bridge and the later stages of development.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah, that's a perfectly viable question.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_02
 So I'm seeing that we're going to just basically focus on this young demographic, aim it at them, but then in the sense that it's bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_02
 But basically we'll make a sleek, simple function, remote control.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_02
 I think this voice recognition thing is we've got a market for it.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think there's too many, more or less be cornering the market on as well.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_02
 We don't have many.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_02
 Compared to a blast-man microphone.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_02
 We don't have many people.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_02
 There's not very many competitors out there that do that.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 So cool.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_02
 I guess we've touched on most of this, the idea of a paging function, a touch-screen, faceplates.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_02
 The thing with, I see, would there not be a, we'd have to maybe sacrifice the faceplates for a touch-screen?

0:16:11	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure that's sincerely correct.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_00
 I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that kind of has a portion of the device is not interchangeable, whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_00
 The case.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_00
 We could have the casing.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_01
 Back to the costs, the material, we have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of faceplates with the package.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_01
 That's something that we're, say we're including three or four faceplates, we can drive the costs up.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_01
 The other question is if we don't include them, are we really in a position to evaluate that market?

0:16:49	SPEAKER_01
 We haven't done any tests on faceplates and whether there's even interest out there.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_01
 So we're going to go ahead, sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, because it would have to, it's not like with cell phones, like we have a Nokia model X and then 10 people make faceplates for it.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_02
 We just are a model of remote control.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_03
 One publicity of a faceplate on a phone is you have it out and around it is sort of emblematic, whereas just sitting at home, so unless somebody comes over to watch TV.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_00
 Well, hopefully some people have people coming over to watch TV.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_00
 And most people have their televisions in the living room.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we can, we can discuss that one further when we think about whether when we do costs and so forth, true plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, cross-apriach later.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah, we will have to evaluate what's most important.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_02
 I think we've had a bit of discussion already on these things.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_02
 Any other questions, comments that came up in these presentations?

0:17:55	SPEAKER_00
 Well, have we confirmed that we're going to go ahead with a touchscreen?

0:18:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think that would be best.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_02
 Let's based on what you guys have all said to me, let's go for a plastic case because that this is the on the cost.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_02
 Try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_02
 That's a great idea.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_02
 With a touchscreen for the basic functions.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_02
 And we'll, yeah, provisionally let's go for a touchscreen room with several sub-manues for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touchscreen.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_02
 Do we have, wait a minute, it occurs to me that if we have a touchscreen, people are going to have to recharge their remote controls.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yet at the same time, that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_03
 Because it would have a docking base.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_02
 Then again, that costs as well.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_00
 So those new within that even the last 20 years, even with the touchscreen.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_00
 Do they?

0:19:16	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_01
 So we have three reports that include one of those.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_03
 And will somebody buy it if we tell them to?

0:19:22	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I don't think, yeah, I can't see anybody buying a remote control that we have to plug in.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_02
 So we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_02
 So let's go with a touchscreen with some kind of, you know, with some cutting edge battery technology.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_00
 For 12 years.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_02
 Well, hey, you know, it's worth looking into.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_02
 If not, we can always default to just doing a well-presented plastic.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_02
 Simple.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_02
 You know, it's, you know, well, yeah, I mean, you can put the, we could, I don't know.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, I suppose we could put the basics on the center easiest, you know, you know, people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_02
 And then the other bits and bobs, you know, go through a menu.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_02
 We'll do the aesthetics.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_02
 So look for the touchscreen in the battery.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_02
 Focus on presentation.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_02
 With this voice recognition option as well.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_02
 Just for the simple functions, the on, off, channels, volume, great.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_02
 And a small paging function, even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging, you know, just some kind of simple button that's just, I guess, another infrared signal to the remote control and well to emit some kind of paging.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_02
 Just okay.

0:20:44	None
 Right.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_02
 So any comments, thoughts before we break into going to the next round of individual work on this?

0:20:56	SPEAKER_01
 Since we're doing a touchscreen, we want to look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the, you know, the actual interface part of it and things like that.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_01
 Or is it just going to be one touchscreen for everybody?

0:21:11	SPEAKER_00
 Interesting.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_01
 What would be on that touchscreen?

0:21:13	SPEAKER_01
 Because you said earlier that we have to think about company colors and logo or something or motto.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_01
 I can't remember exactly what you said.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_00
 We put fashion into electronics.

0:21:26	None
 Yeah.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_02
 It's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin, you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_02
 I think perhaps it's too much.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_02
 Good idea.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah, I think that that one might just be, and just, yeah, I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_02
 A PDA would, it makes a lot of sense for a PDA because you're going to be using it to connect up to things anyway.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what you guys think.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_01
 I think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touchscreen.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_00
 It'd be okay.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_00
 I'm in agreement with that.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_00
 I'm wondering how we're going to get, we put fashion into electronics.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_03
 Well, but if we're going to use a touchscreen where it's going to come on, like on your cell phone, it'll have your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading and then it goes away.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_03
 Perhaps it could be like a temporary comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it because it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, true.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_00
 I'm hoping for subliminal maybe half of a second as it turns.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_02
 It seems like it would suffice to just have the RR on there.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you would think.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_02
 But apparently not.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_01
 People are going to want their remote to boot up and see flashing things.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_01
 Come on.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_01
 It's going to be on and ready to go.

0:22:53	None
 Yeah.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_02
 Well, fair enough.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_02
 Any of that would help the battery life too.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_02
 And if the remote, they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_02
 Then again, who wants to turn on or remote control?

0:23:05	SPEAKER_00
 Well, all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, it'll wake up.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_02
 I'll go into it back to the remote.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_02
 Go to the sleep mode.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_02
 I like that.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_02
 I like the idea of putting the logo in the boot up screen.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_02
 Nice.

0:23:19	None
 Cool.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_02
 So, any last things before we break?

0:23:26	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_02
 Fair enough.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_02
 Sounds good.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to save the copy of this case you guys need reminders.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to save a copy of this and the main set I'll do in a second and put them in the shared folder for a later reference.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_00
 I've put my files in the shared folder.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_02
 Brilliant.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_02
 That's fab guys.

0:23:50	None
 Cool.

0:23:53	None
 All right.
