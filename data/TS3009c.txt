 Oké, laten we beginnen.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_01
 We hebben al veel tijd als de laatste midden.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_01
 We hebben het gehoord.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_01
 Ik ben hier aan de presentatie.

 Ik runnerskanaar via slechts mapspansen en thinkse we moeten worden doen.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_03
 Het is heel belangrijk dat de controle is een fijn en goed gevoel.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_03
 Dit is omdat de laatste model was heel verantwoord, maar mensen die niet lieten dat.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_03
 Dus de nieuwe model moet een goed gevoel zijn dat is iets wat je moet volledig volledig zijn.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_03
 En de gevoel is ook heel goed.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_03
 En ook de manier en wat ik heb om te graag te voelen.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_03
 Er zijn er twee keer in de minuut, want dit is de belangrijkste.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_03
 Dit is twee keer als het belangrijkste.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_03
 En het is hetzelfde voor deze.

 Dat is een kleine tijdicleer te krijgen.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_01
 Het is een contradictie van de eerste function.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_01
 Het is niet een issue.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_01
 En het is een heel moeilijkheid.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_01
 We moeten een van de mensen moeten zijn.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_03
 Ik denk dat we moeten gaan voor de eerste.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_03
 Het is het belangrijkste.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_03
 Dus we moeten een van de mensen moeten zijn.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_03
 Oké.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_03
 Dus het is niet heel belangrijk dat het werkt.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_03
 Easy.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_02
 Het moet wel goed zijn.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_02
 Het kan wel heel moeilijk worden.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_01
 Ja.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_01
 We gaan kijken.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_00
 We zien.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_00
 Ja, je kan een heel moeilijkheid zijn.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_00
 Deze is niet heel belangrijk.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_03
 Het is niet heel belangrijk dat het goed is.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_03
 En mensen zullen het wel goed zijn.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_03
 Oké.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_03
 Oké.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_03
 Dit is de nieuwe kleuren van deze jaar.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_03
 Het moet wel heel goed zijn.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_03
 Het is heel moeilijk.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_03
 people like dit.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_03
 Dus we moeten in deze direction denken.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_03
 Dus het is een zetje.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_03
 Findings.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_03
 Fashion update.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_03
 Fruit and vegetables are cool.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_03
 I am told.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_03
 De groepie is heel plezier dat fruit en vegetables zijn.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_03
 Dus we moeten in dat soort...

0:05:01	SPEAKER_03
 Ja.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_03

 Maardet kanülmeog interessantevelen gebruiken.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_04
 Ja, goed.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_03
 Nou, we doen het.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_03
 All the people like dark colors and simple shapes.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_03
 We don't want all the people, we want young people.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_03
 So we're going to turn that around.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_03
 We're going to have real cool shapes and lots of colors.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_03
 We don't want wood.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_03
 Among the old people.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_03
 So, that's it for me.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_01
 All right, nice.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_01
 Show us.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_00
 Right, I'm going to tell you something about components design.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_00
 Again, I've put up the specification properties.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_00
 I've heard several things, so I'll have to change that on the way.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_00
 But the case, I suggested in the previous meeting, hard plastic.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_00
 But I should indicate that it should be strong and it should feel strong.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe plastic is not sufficient.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_01
 It is, but it doesn't look strong.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_00
 Well, yeah, hard plastic is pretty, pretty tough.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_00
 But it doesn't have a really, really tough look.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_01
 But we still have to look at our price, of course.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_01
 Also, we want an LCD window, etc.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_00
 But we'll return to that.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_00
 The buttons, of course, rubber, I think everyone agrees.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_00
 Electrical cables, copper is all pretty basic stuff.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_00
 The chip made of silicon, I guess.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's the best way to do it.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_00
 Inferred, let is just a simple bulb.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_00
 Then I've had a few findings, made a few findings, a target audience product style.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_00
 It's generally the case that senior and wealthy people, above 45 years old, like, as you said, particularly the traditional materials, such as wood.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_00
 And materials such as that.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_00
 They're also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_00
 But of course, that's not our thing.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_00
 So this is things we must not do.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_00
 And then we have young and dynamic people, which is, of course, our group, the people we aim at.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_00
 Under 45 years old, they like soft materials, with primary colors.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_00
 Soft materials is, of course, again, a bit of concerted, with our material choice of what you said, that it should be hard and strong looking.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_00
 But they like soft materials.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to consider that.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_00
 And also they like curved round shapes, so not to do formal like, like the older people want.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_00
 And if also a finding, but not very applicable here, that sports and gaming devices, such as, the disc mens for joining and those kinds of devices, game devices, should define the characteristics of the device.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_00
 But since we don't have really a sports or game device, so we don't really have to consider that.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_01
 Sports, they're, that the eye-catching ones.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_01
 So it's one on your LCD window.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 That's nice.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_00
 I also have results.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 We keep coming back to the front.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_00
 Several examples of stads, you can get a clear picture of what I mean.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_00
 These are the basic, older people stuff.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_00
 It's not very interesting, very classical looking, but that's not what we want.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_00
 These kinds of things.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know what exactly they are, they look like.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_00
 You know you recognize the shapes.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_00
 It's very primary colors, bright colors, round shapes.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_00
 You also see this device, very round and fruity.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_00
 Fruity, of course.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's terrible.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_00
 And well, round shapes, primary colors, you can see it all here.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_00
 And of course, this famous device, I guess you know something, something, something, something like this.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_00
 So to give you an idea of...

0:09:53	SPEAKER_00
 Strong look, this.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_00
 This has a strong look, although it's plastic, it's the way to look, to give the iron look.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_03
 And it's round, but then you're losing your fruity colors.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well, you have to make a...

0:10:05	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you can make that middle ring, can you, you can make it on a color.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_01
 So, that's kind of the thing.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we can't really make a round, round remote control, I don't think that's very practical.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_00
 No, it isn't.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_00
 But it's important to think about the color, because if you make it gray or silvery looking, it does make it a lot more...

0:10:24	SPEAKER_00
 It does make it looking a lot more stronger.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_00
 But if you look at this, it doesn't look very, very strong.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_00
 But this is plastic, and this is...

0:10:32	SPEAKER_03
 It does have to look strong.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_03
 The results are, the feel of the material is expected to be strong.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_03
 The feel.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_00
 The feel.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_02
 Well, if you...

0:10:42	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't have to be strong.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the feel.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you should have some colored titanium or something, so it looks fruity, but it feels strong.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_00
 Then I have some more findings about the energy source of the device.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_00
 I suggest the basic battery.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_00
 I got some other energy sources, of course, but solar energy is not very practical inside the house, because you don't have a lot of sun.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_00
 And kinetic and dynamics are not very practical, I think, for a simple remote, it's a bit...

0:11:19	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, that's not...

0:11:20	SPEAKER_00
 No titanium.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_00
 That's a bit...

0:11:25	SPEAKER_00
 Much.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_00
 And I also suggest that as a shape, a double curved case, the disadvantages of that, that you can use no titanium, that's the information I received.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_00
 If you use the curved case, a curved case, double curved, then you can't use the titanium.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_00
 What do you think you need double curved?

0:11:44	SPEAKER_00
 Now, this, to give them more modern look.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_00
 Now, the shape, yeah, a curved case.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think it's a sort of triangle shape, the bottom or something.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_00
 In any case, a more modern look, not plain, a long-box style, but...

0:12:01	SPEAKER_00
 That will curve.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_00
 I'll draw it, but maybe later.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_00
 And it gives it a more uniform shape, and if you have a...

0:12:10	SPEAKER_00
 But good.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_00
 As for the buttons, simple push buttons, or otherwise, no difficult scroll things, or something, things like that, because it makes more complex and expensive.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_00
 And as we agreed, we don't use a speaker, or a sensor, or a speech...

0:12:30	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_00
...confolder device, and because it makes it also more complex and expensive.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_00
 But we do use an LCD screen, so...

0:12:38	SPEAKER_00
 We do have to consider...

0:12:40	SPEAKER_00
 We have to use a more advanced chip, which is more complex and expensive, but...

0:12:45	SPEAKER_00
 It's worth the trouble, I think.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_02
 The book has to be made of a soft material, because people like that.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_01
 A rubber, it's a soft material, I guess.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_00
 Soft enough.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_00
 So that's basically what I'm going to talk about.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_01
 We'll take that, and then...

0:13:01	SPEAKER_01
...mic.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_02
 Well, no, no method.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_02
 We will include the buttons, as we discussed earlier.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_02
 And yesterday's screen will be implemented.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_02
 We must decide where this meeting is.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_02
 There are new developments in speech recognition systems, and they are already being used on coffee machines.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_02
 And, well, they're cheap, so we could use them.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_02
 That's interesting.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_02
 It's not really speech recognition, it's more...

0:13:59	SPEAKER_02
 Like, you can talk to the chip, record a message, and record an answer, and then once you talk to the remote them, he will answer with the pre-recorded message that you left.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah, I'm so happy.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_02
 Hi, Mike, and you have recorded...

0:14:19	SPEAKER_02
...hi, Mike, back.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_02
 And you'll get there.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_01
 But you can also say that when you say something, it does some function.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't do anything.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_02
 It makes it...

0:14:32	SPEAKER_03
 It's an extra function.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_01
 And it does.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_01
 It has no functionality.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_01
 No, remote, remote.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_02
 It has to get you, they won't do it.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_00
 But it's young people, not bad.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_02
 It's nice for young people, they like it.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_02
 You should really include that one, actually.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_02
 If it's team, yeah.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, as I said earlier, I think the LCD screens would be positioned at the lower end of the remote.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_02
 The buttons for screen width and channel settings, and that's the thing, and that's kind of stuff.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_02
 We can also do...

0:15:02	SPEAKER_02
...let that kind of functions be shown in the LCD screen.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_02
 So you put the manual...

0:15:08	SPEAKER_02
 Instead of extra buttons.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_02
 I think young people, and...

0:15:13	SPEAKER_02
 Well, every user would like that.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_02
 The buttons should be positioned...

0:15:22	SPEAKER_02
...positioned the same way as they are on...

0:15:25	SPEAKER_02
...well, conventional remotes, I think, for the learnability and...

0:15:30	SPEAKER_02
...well, to keep it recognizable.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_02
 Forage recognition can be implemented.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_02
 And I do an example, but it did not work quite well.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_02
 Can you draw it now?

0:15:44	SPEAKER_02
 I can draw it again, and I know what I did wrong.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't take the notebook box.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_03
 How do you give input to the menu on the LCD screen?

0:15:56	SPEAKER_02
 With the...

0:15:59	SPEAKER_02
...open down and...

0:16:01	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_03
 So you have a menu button, and then you can go over.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_03
 But I will draw what I...

0:16:06	SPEAKER_01
...and also have a screen.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_01
 And okay button.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, right.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_02
 I should submit the bug.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yep.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_02
 If it works.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_01
 There is already a blank, yes?

0:16:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 Hmm, so nice.

0:16:23	None
 You must have to do it.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_03
 Oh no, you have to push hard.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_00
 I suggest a banana shape.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_00
 Because of the fruity fashion.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yellow.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_01
 Next year, that's out.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, all right.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_00
 Just a hunch.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_02
 Well, these little buttons are a bit difficult to draw.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_02
 Those are the channel buttons up.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, just the numbers.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_00
 And then below is the LCD screen.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_02
 Well, these will be bigger in the real design.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_02
 This must be the...

0:17:25	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, button used to interact with the LCD screen.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_02
 And with this, you can go through the menus.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_02
 The video button should be...

0:17:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_02
 You can use it fast within one click.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_02
 And you need a speaker for this button can also be the menu button.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_02
 How do you get out of the menu?

0:17:55	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you could just press the menu button again.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_00
 I press the menu button again.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_00
 It's usual.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_01
 Well, because when you push menu, you get in.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_01
 And then you have to push okay when you get to a choice.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_00
 But you can press menu again to get out.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's also the okay button.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_02
 No, you should have to add an extra menu button.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_01
 Or you can put in the LCD screen, an option, get out.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_01
 Exit.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_02
 Once you have an extra menu button, you don't need that extra option.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_03
 We need a recording button for the speech part.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_02
 And why would you put that then?

0:18:43	SPEAKER_00
 Where is the recording the microphone?

0:18:46	SPEAKER_00
 Where would you put it?

0:18:47	SPEAKER_02
 That could be anywhere.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_02
 That's very small.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_02
 It could be down here.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_02
 Well, not here.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_02
 I suggest here.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_02
 But that's just a little microphone.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_02
 Speaker at the back.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_02
 Well, the speaker in the microphone, I think, are the same little whole thing.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_00
 I understand.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_00
 But we could do, but it's perhaps more expensive.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_00
 Well, speaker on the back or something.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_02
 There are already been implemented in coffee machines, so there won't be very expensive.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_02
 This is my suggested.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_01
 Let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I think, as you can see, so the LCD screen does look better at the lower end.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_02
 I agree.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_02
 That's fine.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_03
 Fine.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_03
 Move on.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I have some examples.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_02
 I can live with it.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_02
 But I did not like it very much.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_02
 Well, these are too big.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_02
 Quite obvious, very ugly, or your mouth?

0:20:07	SPEAKER_00
 They don't look fruity enough.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_00
 No, they're not red.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_00
 They're all black.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_02
 Well, not all.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_01
 Hey, that one I like.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_01
 No, yeah.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_03
 It's a situation, but it does look strong.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_00
 But with the colors, it's been the way we're going to.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, right.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_02
 Well, this is crazy.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_02
 This is crazy.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_04
 It's too much.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's not really too childish, of course.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_02
 These are the LCD screens.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should, if it's possible, one with colors, but I don't know.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_02
 It's too expensive.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_01
 It's too expensive.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:46	None
 All right.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_02
 Ah, even more.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_01
 But are we going for a strange form?

0:20:59	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's very strange.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_03
 It's not too strange.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_00
 It's not too strange.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_00
 It's not too strange.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_03
 You can make it the other side.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_03
 You can make it more round, where the LCD is.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_01
 Kind of bridge.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if you know the mouse.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_03
 It's open at the phone.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_03
 With the round thing at the bottom, something like that.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_03
 No?

0:21:18	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I have a home and a remote.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_01
 If a bridge, it's just a half round, a half circle.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_01
 And then it falls exactly over the hand.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_01
 And that's very nice.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_01
 That feels comfortable.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_03
 But people like something new.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_00
 It's all taken.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_00
 We're different.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_00
 I will design it later, so we'll get to that later.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_01
 Where did I put it?

0:21:43	SPEAKER_01
 The specific shape.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_01
 Conceptual face.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_01
 I think this is it.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_01
 I got this from our friends.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_01
 So our sources.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the conceptual design.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_01
 There's a few examples, which we have to decide about.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the materials from the case.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_01
 The electric cable.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_01
 That's all your, your side of the story.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_01
 Your bag.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_01
 Now, from the user interface, your package.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_01
 We're in a world that's more like the buttons where they have to come.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_01
 And a bit of, yeah, well, a bit of design.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, this is what we've just done.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_02
 But we'll decide about these now.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_01
 And the materials are most.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_01
 The trend watching.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_01
 So as you said, fruity is in netwell.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_01
 Pottery sells good.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_01
 Wow.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, these facts.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to put it in one document.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_01
 So if we go through that.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_00
 Copy based this story into a word documented and put the answers after the subjects.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_00
 Not everything.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_00
 We have to decide all the things.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but all these examples are of a coffee machine.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_00
 Why should I overwrite them?

0:23:12	None
 Yeah.

0:23:13	None
 Yeah.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_00
 Well, a case that's me.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_00
 I suggest, well, what do I suggest actually?

0:23:20	SPEAKER_01
 What kind of properties should it have?

0:23:22	SPEAKER_01
 Well, which is listened.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_01
 I think so.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_02
 Why don't we use titanium or a hard, yeah, some kind of metal for the.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_02
 Do you know the new remote?

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 Not except the front that just like a.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I understand.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_00
 So we have titanium.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_00
 The front is the most important.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but the non-removable elements of the remote, so not the front, could be titanium to give that a strong look.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_00
 And then the front is made of plastic.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_00
 And you can put that on and off and switch it.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_03
 But the field of plastic isn't strong.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_00
 But you have titanium, of course.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_00
 So you have the best of both worlds.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_02
 And you have to remote in your hand like this.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_02
 So you feel titanium.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_00
 And of course, yeah, you have the plastic front end.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_03
 You also have the front end.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_03
 Or cheaper than when you're talking.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, of course.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you have to make.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_02
 And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you wanted to.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but it's expected.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_00
 I guess so.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_00
 So you can make it in less than one.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_02
 I think.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_02
 Bendable.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_00
 No, the weld.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_00
 Well, any color.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_00
 According to my first, it's totally possible to make an entire...

0:24:42	SPEAKER_00
 The titanium is available.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_00
 And we can make an entire remote out of it.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you paint it in the color you want.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the plastic is.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_02
 Paint the color you want.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, right.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_03
 So we're going for a titanium back and a left front.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's a great old front.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I'm going to put it in here because we can...

0:25:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, great.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_01
 Solid fuel and trending.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_01
 So material.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_01
 Hard plastic for the front.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, for the front and the titanium for the back.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_00
 For the normal removable part.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_03
 But then you have the problem.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you have a titanium back.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_03
 You can't switch it.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_03
 When you want to add a color on the front, it doesn't match.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_03
 Well, but...

0:25:34	SPEAKER_02
 Well, titanium is neutral.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_00
 The titanium isn't very...

0:25:38	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't...

0:25:40	SPEAKER_00
 Curse.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_00
 No, a...

0:25:43	SPEAKER_00
 The titanium is very...

0:25:44	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_00
 The titanium is a very basic color.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_00
 And it doesn't really matter if you have a purple front on it or an orange front.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if you disagree, but I think...

0:25:52	SPEAKER_00
 Our customers...

0:25:53	SPEAKER_02
 Doesn't matter if it's a funky 20 colors.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_00
 And even if it doesn't match, people like it.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_00
 What the...

0:26:02	SPEAKER_01
 The electric oak cable is just normal.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_01
 Corp, copper.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_01
 Beans come...

0:26:08	SPEAKER_01
 He's been...

0:26:09	SPEAKER_01
 Someone from the other side of that thing.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_01
 Excuse me.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_01
 The electric oak cable...

0:26:15	SPEAKER_01
 It's copper.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_01
 Just a bit of coffee.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_02
 We don't use it in electric oak.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_02
 No, inside, but this is for a coffee machine.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, inside, we're not comfortable with uses.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_02
 That's not what's meant to you, actually.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_03
 Or well.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_03
 So external.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, external, well.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_00
 We don't...

0:26:34	SPEAKER_00
 What a coffee grain doesn't have...

0:26:36	SPEAKER_00
 Never mind the coffee grain.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_01
 Well, all the inside work of our remote is standard work.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:26:46	SPEAKER_01
 Right?

0:26:48	SPEAKER_01
 The chip is normal.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_01
 The silicon...

0:26:51	SPEAKER_01
 The buttons are normal.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_01
 So, let's set it up.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_01
 So that's just easy.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_01
 We decide about that.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_01
 Just by looking at our competitors and our earlier image.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_01
 The conceptual specification of the user interface.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we have our beautiful drawing.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I've got a better one here, and I will...

0:27:13	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you can put that into the shared folder,

0:27:16	SPEAKER_02
 and then I'll put it in our entry port.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_01
 Our World Word is out. Yes.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_01
 You can put some...

0:27:22	SPEAKER_01
 Which button is what?

0:27:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_01
 The trend watching...

0:27:27	SPEAKER_01
 Proterie shells.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_01
 Include these days.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_01
 And what do we think that fruit and bright colors are...

0:27:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the four things we can launch a couple of packages.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_03
 You can buy a different kind of machine, but it's the same thing with another front.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_01
 You can also implement...

0:27:50	SPEAKER_01
 You can also implement fronts from movies that are very hot.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_02
 Those four later on, the fronts, you can do anything with them.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_03
 But if you launch five different packages, like I put many...

0:28:04	SPEAKER_02
 For the initiative...

0:28:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_00
 For the launch.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_00
 It's a good marketing.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_00
 Or anything like that.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_00
 And then a couple of basic colors.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_00
 Not very...

0:28:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_03
 Not too...

0:28:18	SPEAKER_03
 You can always take another pick.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_01
 We should not give them the most lovely fronts...

0:28:24	SPEAKER_01
 When they buy it later on.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_01
 Come on.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_01
 We still have to make those 50 million.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_00
 Very boring.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_01
 The most boring...

0:28:33	SPEAKER_02
 You can give them a false possible.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_02
 We also...

0:28:36	SPEAKER_02
 They can experiment with it.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, right.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_00
 They want more.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_00
 But you can have some basic colors.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_00
 And then we come with special patterns on them.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_02
 And then we can give them a little bit more.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. All right.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the buttons, etc. we get from Mike.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_01
 This fruit and bright colors.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think we'll have to in the next half an hour.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_01
 We'll have to specify the different types we want to launch when we...

0:29:11	SPEAKER_01
 Well, introduce our remote.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_00
 We still have to make the real basic design.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_03
 Because we have the...

0:29:17	SPEAKER_03
 But we have to catch them.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_03
 We must remember that fancy look and feel is the most important thing.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_03
 Also it won't sell.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:29:24	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I'll have to pick four.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_01
 I get another warning from five minutes.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to get...

0:29:32	SPEAKER_01
 Where is my mouse?

0:29:33	SPEAKER_01
 Where is my mouse?

0:29:34	SPEAKER_01
 Where is my mouse?

0:29:37	SPEAKER_03
 Last my mouse.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_01
 This is it.

0:29:42	None
 Thanks.

0:29:43	None
 I believe you're open.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_01
 Well, this we have...

0:29:54	SPEAKER_01
 Basic stuff.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_01
 Interface we have.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_01
 Supplements LCD.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe a cheap voice recording.

0:30:04	None
 Well, the pie.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yes. All right.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_01
 Individual actions.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_01
 We all agree on that.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_00
 Industry designer ties.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_01
 User interface, Mike.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_01
 You're going to work together.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_01
 On a prototype drawing.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_01
 On the smart board.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we can do that.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_00
 Together or...

0:30:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, together.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_02
 That's what I got to hear.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_01
 We should hear or something.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we'll get it to hear that.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_01
 I think, but I think so.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_01
 There's a smart board.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_01
 You can take the smart board.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_01
 This is the smart board.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:30:35	SPEAKER_02
 I'm taking it to our rooms.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_01
 So you're going to make a prototype.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that includes specifying the buttons.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_01
 We'll see if we can do that.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_01
 So you'll get it on your laptop.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you will go and do something else.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_01
 I'm so...

0:30:55	SPEAKER_01
 Project evaluation.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_01
 What are you going to do?

0:31:03	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know what product evaluation exactly means.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_01
 But you'll get the specifications.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have product yet.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:31:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's why I...

0:31:12	SPEAKER_01
 Kind of difficult.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_01
 But you're fired.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_01
 No, why?

0:31:16	SPEAKER_01
 How long do we still have?

0:31:18	SPEAKER_00
 Well, can we talk about something else?

0:31:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so...

0:31:22	SPEAKER_00
 No, I don't know anything, but...

0:31:23	SPEAKER_00
 Who's the idea?

0:31:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, anyway...

0:31:25	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_02
 Will we use round buttons or square ones for the...

0:31:30	SPEAKER_00
 Round, I think, rounds.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think so.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_02
 Do make it as round as possible.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_02
 These...

0:31:36	SPEAKER_02
 These...

0:31:37	SPEAKER_02
 These buttons?

0:31:38	SPEAKER_02
 Why not?

0:31:39	SPEAKER_02
 I'm more...

0:31:40	SPEAKER_02
 Trial field.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_02
 So you can see you have to...

0:31:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_03
 But for down.

0:31:46	None
 Yeah.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_00
 But now I see the...

0:31:48	SPEAKER_03
 This must be...

0:31:49	SPEAKER_03
 For you, I think.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_03
 And this program.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_02
 Hmm...

0:31:56	SPEAKER_02
 We can't...

0:31:57	SPEAKER_02
 We can't...

0:31:58	SPEAKER_02
 Up and down is program.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_02
 And left and right are...

0:32:02	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that...

0:32:04	SPEAKER_00
 Depends on...

0:32:05	SPEAKER_00
 Depends on...

0:32:06	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we...

0:32:08	SPEAKER_02
 Just turn up the volume.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_02
 We'll see the...

0:32:11	SPEAKER_00
 We'll just give them a...

0:32:13	SPEAKER_00
 We'll design it and let it give comments on it.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't work anymore.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_01
 We can save them, so...

0:32:19	SPEAKER_01
 We'll just have them...

0:32:21	SPEAKER_03
 Stay in there.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_03
 You can...

0:32:23	SPEAKER_03
 Click the corner.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_03
 No!

0:32:25	SPEAKER_01
 It's a bit...

0:32:27	SPEAKER_01
 It's a bit...

0:32:28	SPEAKER_01
 It's a bit...

0:32:29	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we still have more than five minutes.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:32:35	SPEAKER_01
 What are we going to do?

0:32:37	SPEAKER_01
 I, as Greg mentioned, don't have a clue.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_01
 Let's start the design.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, we can...

0:32:45	SPEAKER_01
 Decide how we implement the feeling from our company...

0:32:48	SPEAKER_01
 Into the remote.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_00
 Well, yeah.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_00
 I think...

0:32:52	SPEAKER_00
 A logo, our company logo, and the slogan...

0:32:55	SPEAKER_00
 Also the slogan...

0:32:56	SPEAKER_00
 On the...

0:32:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, why not?

0:32:58	SPEAKER_00
 If there's no space, then you can put the wheel...

0:33:00	SPEAKER_02
 I'll say only the logo.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, me too.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_02
 Too much text and...

0:33:05	SPEAKER_00
 Well, our slogan is not very long, right?

0:33:07	SPEAKER_00
 Just a simple...

0:33:08	SPEAKER_02
 What is the fashion in electronics?

0:33:10	SPEAKER_01
 We put the fashion in electronics.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_03
 We keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:33:18	SPEAKER_00
 But you can put it on the back, on the titanium part.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_00
 The logo and the...

0:33:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and the logo should be...

0:33:24	SPEAKER_02
 The logo, I think.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_02
 On the top.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_01
 And the right top corner.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_01
 Right corner, yes.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_01
 And, well, you can put it in the back.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_00
 You can put...

0:33:33	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe here in the middle.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_01
 At the bottom, you can put the logo...

0:33:37	SPEAKER_01
 With that.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_01
 With the text.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_03
 The logo shouldn't be exchangeable when you...

0:33:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it should be hard on the board.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_00
 And you can...

0:33:47	SPEAKER_02
 The logo can be on every...

0:33:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but you can scratch it over something.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_03
 It's better if you have it...

0:33:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but then you must really...

0:33:55	SPEAKER_02
 Carved into the material.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_02
 Push it in or something.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_01
 Now, you can carve it into the titanium at the back.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_00
 I like the idea of the slogan on the...

0:34:05	SPEAKER_00
 On the thing, but...

0:34:06	SPEAKER_00
 An idea on the one or...

0:34:08	SPEAKER_02
 Well, management, I like it.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_02
 Not on the...

0:34:10	SPEAKER_02
 Front side, I think.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_02
 The front side?

0:34:12	SPEAKER_02
 No, not on the back side.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_02
 But on the back side.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you can push it in.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_02
 So that is...

0:34:17	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a nice idea to make it more recognizable.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_00
 Next to the logo, you have the slogan.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_00
 I agree.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_00
 But not too big.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_00
 Not too big, no, very small.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_00
 Not the entire back, but just very small.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_00
 But readable, not of course.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_00
 But we'll...

0:34:37	SPEAKER_00
 We'll take that with us and then to design.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_02
 Over here, the logo.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_02
 Or maybe here in the middle.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_00
 What we'll design later.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_01
 With logo.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_01
 And...

0:34:48	SPEAKER_01
 logo.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_01
 Also...

0:34:52	SPEAKER_01
 The front, but not X.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_01
 Change.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_01
 So good.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_01
 When changing...

0:35:14	SPEAKER_01
 Front.

0:35:15	None
 All right.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_01
 Do you see a bit of...

0:35:18	SPEAKER_00
 Do you see a bit of...

0:35:19	SPEAKER_00
 Of the...

0:35:20	SPEAKER_01
 5 minutes left.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_00
 Of the titanium on the front.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe if we make this lower part, the front is the upper part and the bit with LCD screen.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_01
 So a bit of titanium between.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_00
 No, now between.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_00
 That's pretty cool.

0:35:39	SPEAKER_00
 But then you have two parts of the...

0:35:41	SPEAKER_00
 Two parts of the...

0:35:42	SPEAKER_00
 You make this titanium too.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_03
 This entire problem with the LCD.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_03
 Like dust in it and things like that.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_03
 When you exchange all the fronts and it's...

0:35:51	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_01
 I already have all kinds of...

0:35:54	SPEAKER_01
 And then not straight line with the...

0:35:56	SPEAKER_01
 Mobile.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_02
 And then the lower part of the titanium.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_02
 This is titanium.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's nice.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_03
 Some kind of way...

0:36:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_01
 Round forms.

0:36:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_00
 I liked it a bit of a titanium also.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_00
 On the...

0:36:12	SPEAKER_00
 A bit like your...

0:36:13	SPEAKER_00
 A bit like your mobile phone.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you can show it to...

0:36:15	SPEAKER_00
 It also has the...

0:36:16	SPEAKER_00
 Doge.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_00
 Just think...

0:36:21	SPEAKER_00
 A bit like this.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_03
 You can make it...

0:36:25	SPEAKER_03
 Go around this corner too, where the logo is.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_03
 Because it has to be...

0:36:30	SPEAKER_03
 There all the time.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_00
 That...

0:36:33	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe a nice touch, yeah.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_00
 A little corner of titanium.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_01
 It's a nice touch, you need.

0:36:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's all the sounds pretty, yeah.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_01
 So this...

0:36:42	SPEAKER_00
 I think I go on to buy a...

0:36:43	SPEAKER_00
 A stationable part.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_01
 We want this.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_01
 And it's only 25 euros.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_01
 Come on.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_01
 No, there's nothing.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no, but...

0:36:51	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's...

0:36:52	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's...

0:36:53	SPEAKER_00
 It looks pretty nice.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_00
 Of course.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_00
 Of course it's my design.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_00
 Our design.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_00
 Take all the credit.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the two are going together.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_01
 You'll get your specifications on your laptop and then...

0:37:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we'll stay here, I guess.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_03
 But there's a problem.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_03
 We can take a blank one.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_03
 What can we?

0:37:10	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think we can...

0:37:11	SPEAKER_01
 I just threw it in...

0:37:12	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we can...

0:37:13	SPEAKER_02
 I guess, a raised animal, I guess.

0:37:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's right.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_00
 But don't erase my cat.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_02
 Or fourth one is empty.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_00
 Oh!

0:37:22	SPEAKER_00
 I want to preserve it.

0:37:24	None
 Hey.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's...

0:37:26	SPEAKER_03
 This one is empty.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's empty one now.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, we have a pre-empty one.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_00
 What are you doing, Chief?

0:37:34	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:37:36	SPEAKER_01
 You can draw.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think we have to wait.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_02
 No, I'll get the...

0:37:41	SPEAKER_00
 I'll get the...

0:37:42	SPEAKER_00
 I don't...

0:37:43	SPEAKER_00
 I don't...

0:37:44	SPEAKER_00
 Do we have to stay here?

0:37:45	SPEAKER_00
 I think we have to wait.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think so.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_01
 Well, maybe you can keep your laptop here.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_01
 So, maybe...

0:37:52	SPEAKER_01
 Or get your mouse, because it's...

0:37:54	SPEAKER_01
 The high power from a ball.

0:37:55	SPEAKER_01
 Hard to work with these plates.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_03
 We'll have to do that.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_03
 It's not relaxing.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_01
 I always have a mouse next to my laptop.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_01
 I hate these.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_01
 I don't have to have a laptop.

0:38:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, touchpad, yeah.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_00
 We can do a touchpad on our remote.

0:38:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, right.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_00
 Just kidding.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_00
 Now, we have to have a bit of humor in the...

0:38:15	SPEAKER_00
 In the discussion, too.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_00
 And then your remote control...

0:38:19	SPEAKER_01
 So, we push a touchpad on it and say, Ha-ha.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, this is no furniture.

0:38:24	SPEAKER_01
 We know you hate it, but...

0:38:28	SPEAKER_00
 But the youth doesn't care about functionality.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_01
 But they do want some gadgets.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_01
 It's all about goofing.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_01
 What are we doing?

0:38:37	SPEAKER_03
 And it will sell.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_03
 We will be rich.

0:38:41	SPEAKER_03
 Bless you.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we will...

0:38:44	SPEAKER_01
 Our bosses will be rich.

0:38:46	SPEAKER_02
 We've done too much in the previous meetings.

0:38:49	SPEAKER_02
 Too much?

0:38:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_02
 We've got nothing to do now.

0:38:53	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that's not bad, isn't it?

0:38:55	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:38:56	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's good.

0:38:57	SPEAKER_00
 We all had our talk and...

0:39:00	SPEAKER_00
 We agree, I guess, on...

0:39:02	SPEAKER_00
 On everything.

0:39:03	SPEAKER_00
 On most and on things.

0:39:05	SPEAKER_02
 It's the best remote in there.

0:39:12	SPEAKER_01
 So.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, he's totally off again.

0:39:22	SPEAKER_01
 Well.

0:39:26	SPEAKER_03
 No, man.

0:39:28	SPEAKER_03
 You just have to push harder.

0:39:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you have to push harder.

0:39:33	SPEAKER_01
 But when I start here...

0:39:36	SPEAKER_01
 It's here.

0:39:38	SPEAKER_02
 You get really close to the screen with your hand.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_02
 And I don't think this.

0:39:47	SPEAKER_03
 Re-calibrate it.

0:39:55	SPEAKER_00
 Where's the good old chalkboard with...

0:39:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:40:00	SPEAKER_00
 Greenboard with... how do you call it chalk?

0:40:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:40:09	SPEAKER_02
 You can better draw a design on this.

0:40:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, maybe.

0:40:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but we can't.

0:40:15	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe if that thing is re-calibrated, we can draw it thin quick.

0:40:19	SPEAKER_00
 And before it...

0:40:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:40:23	SPEAKER_00
 It goes again.

0:40:25	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it's finished meeting now.

0:40:27	SPEAKER_01
 Finished the meeting now.

0:40:28	SPEAKER_01
 All right, now we know what to do, shall we?

0:40:30	SPEAKER_01
 We'll stay here.

0:40:31	SPEAKER_01
 Um...

0:40:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:40:37	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, we'll get to...

0:40:38	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you know.

0:40:39	SPEAKER_00
 Get away.

0:40:40	SPEAKER_00
 Can we get meal here?

0:40:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:40:45	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure.

0:40:47	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe, yeah.

0:40:48	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you have to work on it.

0:40:49	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I'm a few seconds.

0:40:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:40:51	SPEAKER_01
 That's a good idea.

0:40:52	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:40:53	SPEAKER_03
 Have fun, lads.

0:40:54	SPEAKER_00
 Happy holidays.

0:40:59	None
 Don't do too little.

0:41:01	None
 Oh, man.

0:41:02	None
 Make us a nice design.

0:41:03	None
 Going to relax.

0:41:08	None
 I think we have to design here.

0:41:10	None
 Well, maybe this room is only for discussions.

0:41:13	None
 But how can we go up already, for me?

0:41:21	None
 Well, it's a little off again.

0:41:23	None
 And also do we have to...

0:41:26	None
 either industry designer and...

0:41:29	None
 We have to design now together the...

0:41:32	None
 Yeah, here.

0:41:33	None
 All right.

0:41:34	None
 And you would be alive, eh?

0:41:35	None
 Yeah.

0:41:36	None
 Talking with you.

0:41:37	None
 Yeah, they stay here and work here.

0:41:39	None
 You're just staying here.

0:41:40	None
 All right.
