0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 And we're on.

0:00:01	SPEAKER_03
 So, topic number one is we got the NSFATR, ITR, excuse me, which was originally pretty big, but it's divided among many sites, and they cut the budget by two-thirds.

0:00:19	SPEAKER_03
 So they approved it for all the sites, but only gave us like 62% of the money.

0:00:25	SPEAKER_03
 Or excuse me, cut it by 62%.

0:00:29	SPEAKER_03
 So Morgan is, and the other condition is that they have to get a budget out like immediately, or go get the money to someone else.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_03
 So Morgan's working on that.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_03
 So I mean, it's good news.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_03
 It's not as good as it could have been, but it was the ITR's long shot, and so it's really nice.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_03
 What does that say?

0:00:48	SPEAKER_03
 What's that say for?

0:00:49	SPEAKER_03
 Information technology research, something like that.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's pretty much.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's pretty big.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_02
 It's government running it.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_05
 We've got some money that we can use.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_05
 We're in conjunction with SRI, Washington, and Columbia, and to do research on the meetings.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it was specifically on the meeting.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_03
 So was that the one that was the meeting maps?

0:01:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, good.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_03
 I like that one.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_05
 What is meeting maps?

0:01:15	SPEAKER_05
 Mapping meetings.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the general idea was you can think about meetings at lots of different levels, all the way down to acoustics, all the way up to dialogue, discourse, topic.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_03
 And so this was, how do you map all that information onto that?

0:01:31	SPEAKER_03
 It's like creating a map of a meeting.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_03
 So the analogy was you have maps of different things at different resolutions.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_03
 So this had a lot of different stuff in it.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_05
 It actually doesn't have a whole lot of speech stuff to it.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_03
 It's mostly higher level.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but nonetheless, I think it's a cool idea.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_03
 And if we can actually get it going, that would be neat.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_03
 So and this was the one also that was, was it with Susan or Rintrib?

0:02:07	SPEAKER_05
 I don't remember.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_05
 It might have been.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we have to get some.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_03
 She's a linguist on campus.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_03
 Anyway.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_03
 So other topics I wanted to talk about are the Doppademo, which I guess since Morgan isn't here, we can't really talk about it.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_03
 I just wanted to make sure it was ready to go.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_03
 But I guess I said that was already.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_03
 So it's just a question of did Morgan get around to testing it?

0:02:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and I sent you an email.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I got it with the instructions.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_02
 So Morgan, I guess Morgan's leaving on Saturday.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yep.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_02
 So until then, I guess we might hear something.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_03
 So I guess we had better be on call for a little while.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_05
 Did he ever figure out how to switch between applications?

0:02:52	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_05
 I haven't spoken with him.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, he did.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_05
 How was he going to do it?

0:02:56	SPEAKER_02
 All tab.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_02
 Just all tab.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_02
 Like if you hold down alt and a tab tab, the task manager, right?

0:03:02	SPEAKER_03
 The problem was that I was saying hit alt tab with the assumption that he knew what I meant.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_03
 But he didn't.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_05
 So no, he said he tried that, but he didn't like it.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_05
 Because it took it out of the presentation.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_05
 But it doesn't.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, because if you just touch alt, if you just hit it once, it'll go back to the previous application.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_02
 And the previous application was the PowerPoint demo, which was the display of like, you know.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_02
 Oh.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_03
 And all I said was I just cycled with all tab because that's the standard way I hit it in Windows.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_03
 But of course, he doesn't use Windows.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_03
 So you don't have to do you have all tab.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_03
 Hold down alt and then tap tab several times and you cycle through all the open applications.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, okay.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_05
 And then you can come back to your full version.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_02
 And I told him if he decides to use multiple examples for the Prozody demo to open up separate transcribers just so you don't have to load up files during the meeting.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_02
 That's a good idea.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_02
 That's not a bad idea at all.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_02
 So that's it.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_02
 He's got the memory for it soon.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_03
 And since the files are short, yeah.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I'm really short.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_03
 And the TIGL TK overhead is pretty high, but it shouldn't matter.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't have a prompt.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_05
 I'm sorry.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_05
 How much memory does he have?

0:04:06	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't seem to be a problem at all.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_02
 I would imagine he had 64 to 128.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_02
 I think he had 128, but he didn't want to work, I think.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_03
 It was faster than my PC.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_03
 Wow.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_02
 It was fine.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_02
 I think, yeah, I mean, we kind of walk through it a little bit on his laptop.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_05
 So are we the only ones who are giving demo or is Washington going to have a demo?

0:04:32	SPEAKER_03
 I assume, but they're all doing communicator stuff.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, OK.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_02
 And it's part of the talk.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_02
 So it's really not a big part.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, the talk's only 20 minutes.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_03
 So all this time we spent on it, it's going to be 30 seconds.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_03
 Oh my God.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_03
 Screen time.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_02
 But it's a good tool to have.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_02
 The meeting IR stuff is actually.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, both of them.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_03
 Because we're going to want to be playing with the help my brain with the positive stuff.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_03
 So actually, at some point, we should talk to users of that technology who are actually going to be using and see what they would like to see.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_02
 Have you guys seen the display?

0:05:11	SPEAKER_02
 Have you guys seen either the demos?

0:05:12	SPEAKER_02
 They're pretty cool.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_02
 Like, the positive demo, we basically loaded up word alignments.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_02
 So instead of having utter answers in the bottom, it's like just word by word.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_02
 So you can see exactly where the overlaps are.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_02
 And then Adam did something where we converted these feature files into wave files.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_02
 So you can display them.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_02
 Display the feature.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_02
 And then using multi-wave, you can add a file and play that sound.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_02
 And the audio corresponding to that feature file.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_02
 And it's all like a little bit like the F0.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_02
 So you see the pitch contours.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_02
 And when you hit play, there's a line that goes through it.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_02
 And it's all aligned with the audio.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_03
 And the stylized F0 features are pretty cool.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_03
 So this does a piecewise linear.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_03
 And so normally, if you look at an F0 track, it jumps all over the place.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_03
 This is a nice smooth one.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_03
 It really does a good job.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_04
 Does it have a median filter in it or something?

0:06:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, there's a combination.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_02
 It's a linear filter or whatever.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_02
 There's a median filtering.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_02
 Then there's a piecewise linear fit based on some criteria.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_03
 And that's true.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, could you email me a reference to that paper if you have it?

0:06:13	SPEAKER_03
 Sure.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_02
 Because I'm sort of curious how I should email one about it, too, because he was asking about that.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_02
 And yeah.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, so there's obviously a trade-off between the number of knots you pick and the best fit.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, so if you're doing a piecewise linear, you have to figure out how many pieces you want.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_03
 And so there's a trade-off because the best mean-squared fit would be with an infinite number of knots.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_03
 But then it's not a linear fit.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_03
 You're not sure anything, then.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_03
 Well, so there's a trade-off.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_03
 I'm wondering what criteria they use.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I actually don't know off the top of my head.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_05
 Was this code that you downloaded to do this?

0:06:49	SPEAKER_02
 This was Camel Sonema's SRI, who's a coworker with Liz.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_05
 That is a RIDOT comment.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_03
 Did I just... No, I used that SRI, so I had to tell him.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_03
 It sounded like a URL.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know what you were saying.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, sorry.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but so Camel has...

0:07:09	SPEAKER_02
 He did a paper on this for some speech verification project.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_02
 And we basically extrapolated what he did for that work and applied it to our files.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_02
 And that's how we do... That's how we get our future files and everything for our office.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_05
 So what I mean is the implementation that you used was something that you coded up here, or you grabbed it out from somewhere.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_02
 We grabbed both linear-fitting stuff.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_02
 We did all the alignments and all the matching and stuff, but the actual coding of them.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_04
 And the math was done, too.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_04
 These are the 0 contours, which I'm supposed to use for the synthesis thing.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_02
 So that's what you were working on, right?

0:07:47	SPEAKER_01
 Right, that's the same software I used to get the data.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_01
 I gave you a couple examples.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I didn't have time to look at the itself.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_03
 So the other topic is the IBM transcription status stuff.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_03
 So we've sent a few to them. We've gotten a few back.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_03
 I saw it was Jane, who was here because I think she gave one of them to one of the transcribers.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's done now.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_05
 And how was it?

0:08:16	SPEAKER_05
 She said it was much faster.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_05
 It really helped a lot to have that.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_05
 So there were...

0:08:21	SPEAKER_04
 Faster than doing...

0:08:22	SPEAKER_05
 Hand from scratch.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_05
 From the beginning of the process to the end of the process?

0:08:27	SPEAKER_05
 No, so from the point where we take it, it's that's where we want it.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_03
 Right, we know it would be longer to have multiple groups.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_05
 So it's sort of like doing things in parallel.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_05
 Right, you know.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_05
 So if they can be working on high-volume, we're working on other things, then when we get them in, they don't have to do that one from scratch.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_03
 The idea is that we're taking less time of the linguists transcribers.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, right now it is taking a bit of time to turn around the meetings from IBM.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_05
 There's several problems.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_05
 One is we were giving them these large files, which they then had to split up and put on to cassette tapes.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_05
 So either 90-minute or 60-minute tapes, so they had to try to find an appropriate place to break this large file that we gave them.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_05
 So one of the things that we did is Adam made a modification to his script that generates this so that you can tell it that you want to basically chunks that are no more than either 30 or 45 minutes.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_05
 And then we can give those to IBM and it'll make it easier for them to put them on tape.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_05
 Then the other thing is that these pool of transcribers that they're using sort of are not dedicated to our project, but are in use for all IBM projects.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_05
 And IBM has recently given them a whole bunch of stuff, so it's going to sort of delay.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_03
 We might want to revisit hiring our own external transcription company, because I think that would be cheaper than having a project.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_03
 And it would be cheaper than having our people do it, but do it with the same process with these beep files.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_03
 That's an interesting idea.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_03
 Because originally I had discounted that because it was just going to be too hard, but now we have this procedure with the beep files worked out.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_05
 So the only difference would be we would be putting the stuff on tape versus IBM.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_05
 And then we could send, if we had that process down of putting the audio onto tape, we can send IBM the tape so we can send this transcription.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_03
 We might want to do that anyway, because it seems like that's being a bottleneck, and that's silly. It shouldn't be a bottleneck.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, it would once we're on it set up it.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_05
 So I don't know where the bottleneck was. Was the bottleneck in breaking this large file up into the appropriate size chunks, or was it actually putting it onto the tape?

0:10:27	SPEAKER_03
 It may have been partially that, because they tried it, and then they would have to listen to the tape and find out where it bleeds, and go forward in the file, etc.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_03
 But it just seems like it's not hard for us to do, and that would just make things go faster.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so how do we do that? How would we get a tape deck, plug it into the computer, hit record on the tape deck, and just do it all all.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_05
 So plug it to the headphone output in the back of the computer line out, line out into the line in on a tape player.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, that sounds pretty good. So, I mean, that's the easy way. They might have a more complex setup at IBM. I've seen digital, digital analog tapes where it's controlled by the computer.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but we don't need to do that. The disadvantage of doing it this way is it's real time, so you would have to sit there for an hour while it's recording.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but if it was at your desk or something, it's not a big deal.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_02
 So what's the turnaround period right now for IBM?

0:11:23	SPEAKER_05
 Well, there was a lot of people discussing this. They've given us, since we started doing this new beep format with beep number beep, they've given us, I think, two full transcripts.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_05
 They have a third one, and Brian just sent me a note saying, oh, that third one somehow slipped through the cracks of the transcriptionist company.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_05
 And so there's going to be a delay of a week before we get that third one back. And I've already given him three more to work on, but he said those new three won't get done until this big chunk of data has been processed by the company.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_02
 Transcribers here are still working.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, they're working away.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_02
 They're just doing their own thing.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_02
 They're just doing their own way.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_05
 So what we do is when I go to select meetings for IBM, I go into the, well, investor, master sheet here with the statuses.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_05
 And I pick ones that Tilo has pre-segmented, and I change the status to trans-IP IBM so that, you know, when Jane or whoever goes to select the next meeting, they won't choose one of those.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_05
 And so I'm not picking several chunks right now of meetings.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_03
 We should at least ask Brian, if there are any particular requirements for putting things on tape, is there a particular type of tape that they want to use or anything else like that?

0:12:42	SPEAKER_03
 And then we should see how much of a pain it is for one of us.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, the other problem is you'd want to do it on an unloaded machine, right, because you wouldn't want it to start stuttering.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_05
 Huh.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_03
 And that means that that's more a problem because then you have to be there.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_04
 And all of the PCs are connected to the network too here.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_02
 You're just playing it and recording it like real time.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yep.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_05
 So when that thing, when it stutters like that, is it because there's a delay getting the data off a disk, or is it because there's a delay in the D to A?

0:13:23	SPEAKER_03
 It could be either. I mean, there are lots of different places it can be delay on the disk, or it can be just load, gets high on the machine.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_03
 Either IO, load, or processor load.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_03
 That's a problem with these multi-user systems is that lots of processes are running and you don't really have control.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe we could do it from a PC or something.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_04
 But they also have the network.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_00
 A few to line out too. You have to worry about if you click around and you hit a beep or something.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_03
 You can keep on to the tape too.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_03
 That's right. So you really do want to be using a machine that's not.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_02
 And you have to record every channel separately.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_03
 No, because we're doing the beep files.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_05
 Well, you know how OK.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_05
 I think David might have a bunch of old PCs because he's replacing them with these new ones.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe we could get one and just dedicate it to doing this.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_05
 Not even hook it at well.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_05
 I guess we need to hook it to the network so we can get the files to it.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_03
 But you could just, you could have it no active connection just SCP them.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah. Right.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_05
 And then just use that machine to hook up to the...

0:14:24	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, it wouldn't be bad to have that plus put on that machine a CD burner.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_05
 And we don't need a powerful machine to do these things, right?

0:14:32	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_05
 One of these old paniums that we have.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_05
 Should talk to him about that.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_04
 Are you the DVD burner?

0:14:39	SPEAKER_03
 A DVD burner here.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_03
 I guess the real question is where would we put it and who would do it?

0:14:45	SPEAKER_03
 I guess whoever records the meeting.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, it's not a big deal but it's yet another thing you have to do.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. Yeah.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_05
 That's why I wanted to avoid having to do that if we could but...

0:14:56	SPEAKER_05
 It's just another...

0:14:57	SPEAKER_03
 They couldn't use CDs?

0:14:59	SPEAKER_03
 No, because the transcription company does what they do.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_05
 They have a device that you put the cassette in and it has a foot pedal.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, I see.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_05
 Let's go back and forth and stuff like that.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_05
 I see.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_05
 I guess they haven't.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_05
 Actually, there are a few.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_03
 I saw a web based one at one point where you could send them audio files over the web and send you back text files over the web.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_03
 I should look that up again.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_05
 Can you send them huge audio files?

0:15:26	SPEAKER_03
 I assume you can send them anything if they can access with HTTP.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I must be dealing with large amounts of data if they're transcribing anyway.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_02
 That's true.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_02
 People probably aren't sending them, you know, an utter answer to.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_05
 How big are these files that we send to Brian?

0:15:47	SPEAKER_05
 Half a gig.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_05
 Really that big?

0:15:51	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, no.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_03
 It's like 100 Macs.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's a 100 Mac. They're the B files. That's right. So they're smaller.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_05
 That's still pretty dang big.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_04
 It's going to be an email.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_03
 And we are sending in the compressed ones, right?

0:16:07	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know. Whatever you generate.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, the last ones you did work with.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_05
 We're shortened.

0:16:13	None
 Yeah.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_05
 I wonder if the ones before that were shortened.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_03
 The B files actually, the shortened, doesn't save a whole lot.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_03
 Because the whole point is it's extracting parts that are loud anyway.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_03
 I think it only saves like half only.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, please.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so I think we just got to let things slide for now and see.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_03
 See what's going to happen. Nothing else really to do.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_03
 We have new equipment that I'm going to try to set up tomorrow.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_03
 New wireless.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_03
 What will that do?

0:16:50	SPEAKER_03
 Give us a couple more wireless channels.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, so we can get rid of the, yeah.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, that'll be nice.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_03
 But it involves rewiring.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_03
 And so if I could borrow someone tomorrow afternoon, I should be around to help my brain, you know, just have someone to bounce the instructions off of it.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_03
 Make sure I don't do anything too stupid.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sure.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_03
 Did I have another topic on the list?

0:17:16	SPEAKER_03
 Experiments.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_05
 Isn't that next week?

0:17:18	SPEAKER_02
 Experiments?

0:17:19	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I guess that's probably the end.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_03
 What did I have on the agenda I mailed out?

0:17:23	SPEAKER_02
 I think it was.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_02
 So the demo was one of them.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's it.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think that's it.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_04
 Short meetings.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_03
 Does anyone have anything else?

0:17:35	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, I made a, oh, but that's not specific to me anymore.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_05
 I was going to say I took some suggestion of atoms and I created a CGI script that lets you see the current status of the speech disks.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_05
 So if you go to the speech local web page and then there's a disk status page, you can click on that and it'll query Abbott and give you a list of all the disks that we have and then what's on each one and then it shows how big the disk is and what percent full it is.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_05
 Cool.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_05
 So and that's, you know, each time you go there, it's updated.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_02
 So what are the new disks that are installed now?

0:18:11	SPEAKER_05
 The new disks are installed if you need space just let me know.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_05
 I have to create the appropriate sub directory.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_05
 So we're kind of trying to keep, even the scratch ones, we're keeping a little organized where we put a U-doctor speech data and then I'll either create a sub directory for like if it's meeting a quarter project or hub five or whatever.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_05
 So we, I just have to create those sub director.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_05
 Do we have new DD disks also?

0:18:33	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_03
 Darn.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_03
 So it's all just scratched.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_03
 It's all scratched.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_03
 How are we doing on?

0:18:41	SPEAKER_05
 Uh, DE, which is where we're putting all the meeting stuff.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_05
 Now DE is full.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_03
 We must be doing it on DF.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's DE.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_05
 DE is not full.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_05
 DE is full.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_05
 D-D is full.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_05
 That was the first one or that was the last one that filled up.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, I guess I'm just going to slow it all off.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_05
 DE still had like, last time I looked it was like seven gigs or something.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_05
 So in each meeting is roughly half a gig and so that means we're getting close.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_05
 We're getting close.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_05
 So.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_02
 We're just going to keep recording like at some point.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_05
 Morgan said something about stopping at the end of the year.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_05
 Like when we get around a hundred meetings.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_05
 Because there's going to be data coming from UW.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_05
 Hopefully by that.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_03
 I just hate not to get data.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I feel spawning.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_05
 How did we have to keep the community?

0:19:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's like you build this room up for so long and then it's just like.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_02
 You start.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_05
 Now that we're used to recording it's like, well why not keep going?

0:19:34	SPEAKER_03
 The other thing we could do is stop doing the regular ones and try to convince other topics to come in and do some.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_03
 Because I think that would be nice.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_05
 We have right now like 75 or 76 hours.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_03
 You know, the other thing we were talking about also is once we, once the disk has been backed up, we don't actually needed online.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_03
 So another option is to copy it to tape manually so we have the backup copy and the tape copy.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_03
 The archive copy and the backup copy and then just take them offline.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_05
 But aren't we still using the compressed?

0:20:10	SPEAKER_03
 Once we have the expanded versions.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_03
 So if we have a ton of scratch disks, maybe the thing to do is leave those up and then use and then not necessarily have the original data online.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, we need to figure something out because the habit is basically full.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_05
 We can't add any more disks to it.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_05
 We can increase the size of the disks that are on it but that will only take us so far.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_05
 David had to suggest in about new servers and things like that.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_05
 So if we can talk to Morgan about getting some money for a new disk server.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_03
 And that would be pretty tight in the machine room.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it would have to replace the habit basically.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_05
 Well David's plan to get new servers anyways for all of the main servers.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it's full and there.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_05
 We've seen it recently with all of the new machines that we got.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_05
 The assembly 100s.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_05
 They're stacked upon benches and things all over.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_05
 It's really crowded.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_04
 But they're not yet accessible.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_05
 Oh yeah, yeah, they're in the, yeah, if you do the name.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_05
 What are the name?

0:21:27	SPEAKER_05
 I've forgotten now.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_05
 I assume they're in the P-Make pool.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, they're in the P-Make pool.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_05
 So if you do a Reginfo minus show attribute and...

0:21:37	SPEAKER_03
 P-Make stuff, P-Make magic.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_03
 Or Customs magic.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_05
 You can get a list of all the machines that are available to P-Make by using the command Reginfo minus show ATTR.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe you can send me that.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and then if you do man customs, it has almost all of that.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_05
 And I'm not sure what attributes we attach to the sunblade 100s, but it could be SB100.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_05
 And so if you query for all machines that have that attribute, then you should see the names.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_05
 New machines.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_03
 Do we have an attribute for non-interactive machines?

0:22:12	SPEAKER_03
 Because I was thinking that would be a good one to have non-interactive ones that aren't on people's desks.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_05
 Well, there's sort of... there's this one called... there's that attribute called no...

0:22:22	SPEAKER_05
 What's it called?

0:22:24	SPEAKER_05
 NoeVict, which is roughly that.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_05
 It's... although it's like my machine has it on my desk, so I do get jobs running on my machine all the time.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_05
 But... so that's sort of what it is.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_03
 Anyway, should we do digits?

0:22:48	SPEAKER_03
