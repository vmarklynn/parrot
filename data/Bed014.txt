0:00:00	SPEAKER_04
 see

0:00:21	SPEAKER_05
 Mental mental Rom pilot

0:00:43	SPEAKER_03
 testing

0:00:45	SPEAKER_04
 Suppolins. Suppolins.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_04
 Three.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_04
 I am three.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_04
 See, that matches the seat up there.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, well, I guess it's coming up then.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_04
 Because it's, that starts counting from zero and you start counting from one.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_04
 There it goes, the classic off by one error.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_05
 But mine is correct.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_05
 Is it?

0:01:14	SPEAKER_05
 It's one.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_05
 Channel one.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_05
 Your mic.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, oh, oh.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_04
 So it would.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_04
 Oh.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_04
 Oh.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_04
 So.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_04
 I've bested you again, Nancy.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_04
 But your paper is correct.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_05
 Paper is correct.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_04
 Look at the paper.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_04
 I didn't, I was saying the microphone, not the paper.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_04
 It's always offset.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_05
 Yes, you bested me again.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_05
 That's how I think of our continuing interaction.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_05
 Damn, I boiled again.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_05
 So is Keith showing up?

0:01:43	SPEAKER_04
 He's talking with George right now.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_04
 Is he going to get a rip himself away from, from that?

0:01:48	SPEAKER_01
 Probably not.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_01
 Is my guess.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, then it's just going to be the five of us.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_03
 Well, he was very affirmative in his mail saying he will be here at four.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_03
 But, you know, there was before he knew about the George Vector problem.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_01
 This is not, it's not bad for the project if Keith is talking to George.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_01
 So my suggestion is we just.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_01
 For the head.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_01
 For the head.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_05
 Are you in charge?

0:02:21	SPEAKER_05
 Sure.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I sort of had informal talks with most of you.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_03
 So, either just the report, he's really happy about the CBT's being in the same order in the XML as in the.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_03
 The Java declaration formats.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_03
 So you don't have to do too much in the star sheet.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_03
 Transversion.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_03
 The Java, the embedded base wants to take input a base net in some Java notation.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_03
 And Eva is using the XLR and star sheet processor to convert the XML that's output by the Java base.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_03
 With it into the ebase input.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_05
 I should maybe try like emailing the guy and see if he has something already.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_05
 Sure.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_02
 He has both the Java base and the embedded base.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_04
 But that's some sort of conversion program.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_05
 And put them into different formats.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_04
 I think you should demand things from him.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_01
 He charges so much.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. No, I think it's a good idea that I'm just going to ask.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_03
 And well, pretty much on the top of my list, I would have asked Keith how the where is X hand parts is standing.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_03
 Let's skip that.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_03
 There's good news from Drone Outer generation templates I've run.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_04
 So the trees for the XML trees for the for the genet for the synthesizer are written.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_04
 So I just need to do the red and new set of tree combining rules.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_04
 But I think those are pretty similar to the old ones.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_01
 So just going to be, you know, you were going to send me a note about hiring.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't finish the sentence, but he understood it.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_01
 I know what he's talking about.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_01
 The names he doesn't.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_05
 Hiring somebody.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_03
 The guy.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_03
 OK, so natural language generation produces not just a surface string that is fed into a Texas speech.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_03
 But surface string with a syntax tree that's fed into a concept of speech.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_03
 Now, this concept of speech module has certain rules on how if you get the following syntactic structure, how to map this into the present rules.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_03
 And Faye has full heartedly agreed to rewrite the German concept syntax to the present rules.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_05
 I know she spoke German.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_03
 No, she doesn't.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, OK.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_05
 She speaks English.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, we write the German ones in English.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_03
 In English.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_03
 And therefore, if it's OK that we give her a couple more hours a week, then she'll do that.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_04
 What languages are written?

0:05:30	SPEAKER_04
 Is that that scheme thing you showed me?

0:05:32	SPEAKER_03
 That's the list type scheme.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_03
 She knows how to program in scheme.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_04
 I hope.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_03
 No, I...

0:05:39	SPEAKER_03
 My guess is I ask for a commented version of that file.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_03
 If we get that, then it's doable even without getting into it.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_03
 Even though the scheme stuff is really well documented in the...

0:05:51	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I guess a few not used to functional programming scheme can be completely incomprehensible, because there's no...

0:05:58	SPEAKER_04
 Like, there's lots of unnamed functions and, you know...

0:06:02	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway, it will sort this out.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_01
 But anyway, send me the note and then I'll check with Morgan on the money.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_01
 I don't anticipate any problem, but we have to ask.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, so this is, you know, on the generation thing, if she's really going to do that, then we should be able to get prosody as well.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_01
 So it'll say it's nonsense with...

0:06:30	SPEAKER_00
 Perfect.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_00
 We should.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_04
 Are we going to...

0:06:34	SPEAKER_04
 Can we change the voice of the thing?

0:06:36	SPEAKER_04
 Because right now the voice sounds like a murderer.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yep, we have to change the voice.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_04
 Which one?

0:06:42	SPEAKER_04
 The little smarticus.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_04
 Smarticus sounds like a murderer.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_04
 Oh.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_04
 I have your reservations.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_02
 But I will not give a key on this, you come into my land.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_03
 We have the choice between the usual festival voices, which I already told the smart people.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_03
 We aren't going to use because they're really bad.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_03
 Festival?

0:07:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, program.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, okay, no, since the song.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_03
 But...

0:07:06	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, gee, I has crafted a couple of iPhone-type voices that are really nice, and we're going to use that.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_03
 We can still agree on a gender if we want.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_03
 We still have male or female.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_05
 Well, it's like whatever sounds best.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_05
 Whatever sounds best.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_04
 There's O.G.A. Stanford.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_04
 Fortunately, probably male original German institute.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_03
 Oregon.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_01
 Oregon, graduate institute.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_01
 Turns out this, the longstanding links with these guys in the speech group.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_01
 In fact, there's this guy who's basically got a joint appointment.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_01
 Heenick Hermanski.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_01
 He spends a fair amount of time here.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_03
 Won't be a problem.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_03
 And it's probably also absolutely uninteresting for all of you to learn that as a group, as of 20 minutes ago, David and I per accident managed to get the whole smart-com system running on the XC Linux machines with the XC and T machines, thereby increasing the number of running smart-com systems in this house from one on my laptop to three.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_03
 I was just by accident.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I know, but it's very nice.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_03
 I suggested to try something that was really kind of, you know, against better knowledge, shouldn't have worked, but it worked.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_03
 Intuition.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe a bit for the intuition thing.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_03
 And we'll never find out why.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_03
 It's just like why the generation for the presentation manager is now working.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_02
 Which is something you get used to as a programmer, right?

0:08:52	SPEAKER_02
 It's cool it works that way.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_03
 So the people in Zabrik and I decided not to touch it ever again.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_03
 I was going to ask you where something is.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_03
 What we know about that.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_03
 Where is that?

0:09:11	SPEAKER_03
 Where is the junction?

0:09:13	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, but we can ask, did you get to read off 400 words?

0:09:19	SPEAKER_03
 Was it a day?

0:09:21	SPEAKER_04
 I was looking at it, it doesn't follow logically.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_04
 The first paragraph doesn't seem to have any link to the second paragraph.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_02
 Each paragraph is good though.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_02
 It's fine.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_02
 It was written by committee.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_01
 But the meeting looks like it's going to be good.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_05
 I didn't know about it until I remember telling you.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_01
 I ran across it and I didn't even know where.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_01
 It's just some weird place.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 I'm surprised I didn't know about it.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_01
 We know all the invited speakers.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't tell me.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_01
 But anyway.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_01
 Before we were sort of.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_01
 I also had a nice email correspondence with Daphne Kohler.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_01
 I'd love to work with us on using these structured belief nets and stuff.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_01
 But starting in August.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_01
 She's also got a new student working on this.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_01
 We should get in touch with them again in August.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_01
 We'll figure out a way for you to get seriously connected with their group.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_01
 That looks pretty good.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'll say it now.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_01
 It looks to me like we're now at a good point to do something.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_01
 Start working on something really hard.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_01
 And so far working on things that are easy.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_01
 Which is mental spaces and or.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_01
 But the other part of it is the way they connect to these.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_01
 So there's all the problems that the linguists know about mental spaces.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_01
 And the cognitive linguists know about.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_01
 But then there's this problem of the.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_01
 Belief net people have only done a moderately good job of dealing with temporal belief nets.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_01
 Which they call dynamic.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_01
 They incorrectly call dynamic belief nets.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_01
 So there's a term dynamic belief net.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't mean that.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_01
 It means time slices.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_01
 And it's really used those people using.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_01
 But one of the things I would like to do over the next month and make take more.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_01
 Is to understand to what extent we can not only figure out the constructions for them for multiple world.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_01
 But the formalism will look like and where the slots and fillers will be.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_01
 But also what that would translate into in terms of belief net and the inferences.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_01
 So the story is that if you have these probabilistic relational models, they're set up in principle.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_01
 So that you can make new instances and instances connect to each other and all sort of stuff.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_01
 So it should be feasible to set them up in such a way that if you've got the past tense and the present tense, and each of those is a separate belief structure that they do their inferences with just the couplings that are appropriate.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_01
 But that's as far as I can tell is putting together two real hard problems.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_01
 One is the linguistic part of what are the couplings.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_01
 And when you have a certain construction that implies certain couplings and other couplings.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 Between, let's say the past and the present or any other one of these things.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_01
 And then we have this inference problem of exactly technically how does the belief net work?

0:13:28	SPEAKER_01
 If it's got, let's say one in different tenses or my beliefs in your beliefs or any of these other ones of multiple models.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 So, you know, in the long run we need to solve both of those and my suggestion is that we start digging into them both in a way that hopefully turns out to be consistent.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_01
 And sometimes it's actually easier to solve two hard problems than one because they constrain each other. I mean, you've got huge, huge drain of possible choices.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway, so that's...

0:14:17	SPEAKER_02
 Well, yeah, like I solved the problem of... you were talking about how do you... various issues of how come a plural noun gets to quote counters and noun phrase, you know, occurs an argument about the construction. But a bear singular stem doesn't get to act that way.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_02
 And it would take a really long time to explain it now, but I'm about to write it up this evening.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_02
 I solved that at the same time as how do we keep adjectives from floating to the left of determiners and how do we keep all of that from floating outside the noun phrase to get something like I, the kick dog.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_02
 That's great.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_02
 Did it at once. So maybe it will be a second.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_01
 No, I know. I think that is going to be sort of the key to this whole... to the big project of the summer of getting the instructions right is that...

0:15:07	SPEAKER_01
 People do manage to do this, so there probably are some relatively clean rules. They're just not context-free trees.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_01
 And if the formalism is good, then we should be able to have a sort of moderate scale thing.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_01
 And that, by the way, is key to what I encourage George to be talking with you about not the formalism yet, but the phenomena.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, another thing.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_01
 There was this thing that Nancy agreed to in a weak moment this morning that...

0:15:47	SPEAKER_01
 That was very strong.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry, in a friendly moment.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_01
 That's the same thing.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway, that we were going to try to get a first cut at the revised formalism by the end of next week.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, probably skipping the mental spaces part.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_01
 Just trying to write up essentially what you guys have worked out so that everybody has something to look at.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_01
 We've talked about it, but only the intermost-intergroup currently knows...

0:16:25	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, and not even all of them really do.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_02
 The group has a whole no. It's about no individual members.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_01
 This one of the advantages of document, right, is that it actually transfers from head to head.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_01
 So, communication.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_01
 Communication.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway, so with a little luck, let's head that as a goal anyway.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_02
 What was the date there of Monday or...

0:16:54	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, no, no.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_01
 We've talked about it at the end of next week.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_05
 But the two of us will probably talk to it well before...

0:17:02	SPEAKER_02
 Anyway, let's talk separately.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_02
 It's a week after that.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_01
 So sometime next week, it turns out that that effort leads us into some big hole.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_01
 That's fine.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_01
 You know, if you say, here's a really hard problem, we haven't solved it.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_02
 That's just fine.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_02
 But at least sort of trying to work out what the state of the art is.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_01
 Right, so to the extent that we have it, let's write it.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_01
 And to the extent that we don't, let's find out what we need to do.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_03
 Can we... is it worth thinking of an example out of our tourism thing domain that involves a decent mental space shift?

0:17:47	SPEAKER_01
 I think it is.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_01
 But I interrupted before Keith got to tell us what happened with where is the powder tower or whatever.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_02
 Well, what was supposed to happen?

0:17:58	SPEAKER_02
 I sort of actually caught up in some other ones.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_02
 You know, I don't have a write-up of... or have it elaborated on the ideas that we were already talking about.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think we already came to the conclusion that we have two alternative paths that we... two alternative ways of representing it.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_03
 When it sort of has...

0:18:20	SPEAKER_03
 It's gone.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_02
 The question of whether the polysamy is sort of like in the construction or the frag management.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_03
 It comes... this resolved later here.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_02
 I think it has to be the second case.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_02
 So you... isn't clear what we're talking about here.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_02
 The question is whether the construction is semantic or ambiguous between asking for location and asking for direction.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_02
 Should we have... or whether the construction semantically is clearly only asking for location but pragmatically that's construed as meaning...

0:18:55	SPEAKER_03
 And these are two notes that we can observe in the base net.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_03
 So these are either true or false, and it's also just true or false.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_03
 If we encounter a phrase such as where is X, should that set this to true and this to true and the base net figures out which under the situation is more likely?

0:19:15	SPEAKER_03
 Or should it just activate this, have this be false and the base net figures out whether this actually no means?

0:19:25	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that's a separate issue.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_01
 So I agree with you that it's a disaster to try to make separate constructions for every pragmatic reading.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_01
 Although there are some that will need to be there.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_05
 Or have every construction list all the possible pragmatic implications...

0:19:52	SPEAKER_05
 You can't do that in the same way.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_01
 Almost certainly, can you pass the solve?

0:19:58	SPEAKER_01
 Is the construction worth noting that there is this?

0:20:02	SPEAKER_02
 This one is maybe in the gray area.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_02
 Is it like that or is it just sort of obvious from the world knowledge that no one...

0:20:12	SPEAKER_02
 You wouldn't want to know the location without wanting to know how to get there.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_03
 Or in some cases it's quite definite.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_02
 So that you just want to know what the question is basically is this conventional or conversational?

0:20:24	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_01
 I guess the more important thing at this stage is that we should be able to know how we would handle it in the short run.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_01
 It's more important to know how we would treat technically what we would do if we decided A and what we would do if we decided B.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_01
 Then it is to decide A or B right now.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_05
 There will be other examples that are one way.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_01
 We know for sure that we have to be able to do both.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_01
 So I guess in the short run let's be real clear on what the two alternatives would be.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_03
 And then we had another idea floating around which we wanted to get your input on and that concerns the...

0:21:08	SPEAKER_03
 But the next thing is we would have a person that would like to work on it.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_03
 And that's Irina Gurriavitch from EML who is going to be visiting us the week before August and a little bit into August.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_03
 And she would like to apply the ontology that is being crafted at EML.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_03
 That's not the one I sent you. The one I sent you was from GMD out of the European Crumpet Sterbil.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_03
 Agreed.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_03
 And one of the reasons... one of those ideas was...

0:21:45	SPEAKER_03
 So back to the old journal observation that if you have a dialogue history and it said the word admission fee was mentioned.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_03
 It's more likely that the person actually wants to enter than just take a picture of it from the outside.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_03
 Now what could imagine to have a list for each construction of things that one should look up in the discourse history?

0:22:12	SPEAKER_03
 That's the really stupid way.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_03
 Then there is the really clever way that was suggested by Keith.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_03
 And then there is the middle way that I'm suggesting.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_03
 That is you get X, which is whatever the castle. The ontology will tell us that castles have opening hours, that they have admission fees, they have whatever.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_03
 And then this is... we go via a Thessaurous and look up certain linguistic surface structures that are related to these concepts and feed those through the dialogue history and check dynamically for each entity.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_03
 We look it up, check whether any of these were mentioned and then activate the corresponding nodes on the discourse side.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_03
 But Keith suggested that a much cleaner way would be to keep track of the discourse in such a way that you... if you know that something like that has been mentioned before, this just continues to add up.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_02
 If someone mentions admission fees, that activates an enter schema which sticks around for a little while in your representation of what's being talked about.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_02
 And then when someone asks where is Axe, you've already got the end of a priming.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_01
 Priming, spreading the information.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_01
 So that's certainly more realistic, psychologically.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_01
 Now it's technically...

0:23:37	SPEAKER_04
 Well, does it seem like if you just manage the dialogue history with a thread that kept track of the activity of...

0:23:48	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, because the thread would know what nodes needed to be activated so we could just keep track of how long it's been since something's been mentioned and automatically loaded in.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_01
 You could do that. But here's a way... in the bullet base network, you could think about it this way.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_01
 That if at the time admissions fee was mentioned, you could increase the probability that someone wanted to enter.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_04
 Well, that's what I wasn't thinking in terms of enter scheme as I was just...

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 Fair enough. Okay. But in terms of the current implementation, right?

0:24:33	SPEAKER_01
 So that...

0:24:35	SPEAKER_05
 It would be higher in the...

0:24:38	SPEAKER_01
 The conditional probability that someone... so at the time you mentioned it, this is essentially the base net equivalent of the spreading activation.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_01
 In some ways, it's not as good, but it's the implementation we got. We don't have a connection with the implementation.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_01
 Now, my guess is that it's not a question of time, but it is a question of whether another intervening object has been mentioned.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, we could look at dialogue. This is... of course, the other thing we do is we have this data coming, which probably will blow all our theories.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_01
 But skipping that. So... but my guess is what will probably happen... here's a proposed design.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_01
 Is that there are certain constructions which for our purposes do change the probabilities of EFA decisions and various other kinds.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_01
 And that the standard way that these contexts work is sort of stacked like or whatever. But that's sort of the most recent thing.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_01
 And so it could be that when another... tourist entity gets mentioned, you...

0:25:52	SPEAKER_01
 Re-initialize the state.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_01
 And of course, if we had a fancy one with multiple worlds, you could have... you could keep track of what someone was saying about this and that.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_01
 You know, I want to go... in the morning, I want...

0:26:13	SPEAKER_02
 What's my plan for today? Here's my plan for today.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, in the morning. I'm planning to go shopping the afternoon, to the powder tower. I talk to some talking about shopping.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_01
 And then you say, you know, well, what's it cost? Or something? Anyway, so one could well imagine, but not yet.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_01
 But I do think that the... it'll turn out that it's going to be... pretty much on whether there's been an override.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I mean, if you ask how much I said train ride in Sonoma, around the Winiards cost and then somebody tells you it's $60, and then you say, okay, how much is...

0:26:55	SPEAKER_03
 I would like to visit the... whatever, something completely different. Then I go to... you know, poor Drase. It's not more likely that you want to enter anything, but it's...

0:27:06	SPEAKER_05
 It's not a matter of fact, I think, the rejection of entering and doing that. So when you admit... have admission fee and it changes something, it's only for that particular...

0:27:14	SPEAKER_05
 It's relational, right? Yeah, I think that...

0:27:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well, and the simple idea is that it's only... it's only for the current tourist entity of interest.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_03
 But that's... I mean, this... this function... so has the current object being mentioned in... with...

0:27:33	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, no. It goes in the... it goes in the direction. Is... when the... this is mentioned the... probability of... let's say entering...

0:27:47	SPEAKER_01
 A change of objects.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_01
 Changes.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_04
 You could just... basically, it... it observes and... that's the... a node for...

0:27:56	SPEAKER_01
 Enter to... but I think... Robert's right that to determine that...

0:28:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, you may well want to go through a... the... the... so... if the issue is... if... so now this... this construction has been matched and you say, okay, does this actually have any implications for our decisions? Then there's another piece of code that presumably... does that computation?

0:28:22	SPEAKER_05
 So sort of forward-changing in a way... rather than... yeah.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_01
 But what Robert's saying is... is... and I think he's right... is you don't want to try to build into the construction itself...

0:28:36	SPEAKER_01
 all the synonyms and all the... maybe. I have to think about that.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know. I mean, I can think... I can think of arguments in either direction on that. But somehow you want to do it.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_03
 It's just another sort of construction side. It's... how to get the possible inferences we can draw from the discourse history...

0:29:06	SPEAKER_03
 or changing of the probabilities and... or...

0:29:12	SPEAKER_05
 I guess it's like... the other thing is whether you have a user model that has, you know, whatever, a current plan...

0:29:21	SPEAKER_05
 whatever... plans I have been discussed and... I don't think.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_04
 What's the argument for putting it in the construction? Is it just that the synonyms selection is better?

0:29:32	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the argument is that... you're going to have the... if you recognize the word...

0:29:41	SPEAKER_01
 you recognize the word which means you have a electrical construction for it...

0:29:45	SPEAKER_01
 so you could just as well tag the electrical construction with the fact that it's a...

0:29:52	SPEAKER_01
 you know, 30% increase in probability of entering. So you could... you could invert the whole thing...

0:30:00	SPEAKER_01
 so you... you tagged that information onto the lexicon since you... had to recognize it anyway.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_01
 That's the argument in the other direction.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_03
 Even though the lexical construction itself or the other context won't do it.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_03
 You have to keep track of what the person is. But I'm not interested in the opening times...

0:30:24	SPEAKER_03
 is sort of more a V time.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, there's that as well.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_03
 But we'll... we have time to... just a sidetrack.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_03
 But I think it's also something that people have not done before is...

0:30:43	SPEAKER_03
 sort of abuse and autology for these kinds of inferences on whether anything relevant to the current...

0:30:52	SPEAKER_03
 something has been... has crept up in the data history already or not.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_03
 And I have the... if we wanted to have that function in the dialog...

0:31:04	SPEAKER_03
 dialog module of SmartCom, I have the written consent of Jan to put it in there.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_01
 Good. Okay. Well, this is highly relevant to someone's thesis.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yes. You've noticed that.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_03
 That's... I'm keeping on good terms with Jan.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_01
 So the point is, it's very likely that Robert's thesis is going to be along these lines.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_01
 And the local rules are... if it's your thesis, you get to decide how it's done.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. So if you know... if this is... seriously, if this becomes part of your thesis, you say, hey, we're going to do it this way. That's the way it's done.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it's not me. It's always me when it's someone's thesis.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, no. No, no. We got a lot of thesis.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_01
 It's going to be nice right now. Yeah.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_05
 So nice.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_03
 Well, let's talk after Friday the 29th, then we'll see you all.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_03
 Right. So he's got a...

0:31:58	SPEAKER_03
 He's got a... meeting a company with a thesis advisor.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_03
 I should try to finish it by then, yeah.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. So I think, in fact, that's the other thing.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_01
 This is... speaking of heart problems, it's a very good time to start trying to make explicit where construal comes in and where the construction per se ends and where construal comes in.

0:32:49	SPEAKER_01
 Because this is clearly part of...

0:32:51	SPEAKER_01
 I've never been to that.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_01
 We've been doing quite a bit of that.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_01
 That's part of what the...

0:32:54	SPEAKER_01
 Many jobs for you, Robert.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. Well, he's going to need you.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_01
 He's always landing your camera in your line.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. Right. So...

0:32:59	SPEAKER_01
 So that's why we want the formalism.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_01
 It's because it is going to have implicit in it.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_05
 No, you weren't there on purpose.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe my thesis decision.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_01
 Right. Well, that's...

0:33:12	SPEAKER_01
 Ten of... they aren't decisions. They're just proposals.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_01
 Decisions.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_01
 That's the point.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_03
 It's constraints.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_03
 That's kind of constraints that Robert's going to do.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but the decisions I made were headed to with my thesis.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_04
 So consequently, don't I get to decide then that it's Robert's job?

0:33:28	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_05
 I'll just pick a piece of the problem and then push the hard stuff into the center and say it's Robert's.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_03
 I've always been completely in favor of consensus decisions.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_03
 So we'll...

0:33:42	SPEAKER_03
 We'll find a way.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_01
 We will.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_01
 But...

0:33:46	SPEAKER_01
 I haven't.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_03
 It might even be interesting then to say that I should be forced to sort of pull some of the ideas that if we're floating in my head out of the top head.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_03
 And...

0:34:03	SPEAKER_03
 That's better for us, that's good.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_03
 Anyway.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_01
 No, absolutely.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_01
 So you had done one draft.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_03
 And...

0:34:15	SPEAKER_01
 And another draft.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_03
 None of that is basically still around, but...

0:34:19	SPEAKER_03
 I guess it's not around.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't read it.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_01
 I'm shocked.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_01
 This is the first time I've seen a thesis proposal change.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_01
 But yeah, second...

0:34:28	SPEAKER_01
 That would be great.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, you're going to need it anyway.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and I would like to discuss it and get your guys' input and make it sort of bomb-proof.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_01
 Bomb-proof.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_01
 Put it proof.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_01
 That's what I was searching for.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_01
 Good luck.

0:34:45	None
 So that...

0:34:46	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, so this is the point is we're going to have to cycle through this.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_01
 But the draft of the proposal on construction is going to tell us a lot about what we think needs to be done by Construro.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_01
 And we've got to be doing it.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we need some...

0:35:08	SPEAKER_03
 Then we need to make some dates.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_03
 Meeting...

0:35:14	SPEAKER_03
 Regular meeting time for the summer.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_03
 We really haven't found what we did.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_03
 Thursday is one for a while.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_03
 I just talked to ARMY.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_03
 It's a coincidence that he can't do...

0:35:23	SPEAKER_03
 Couldn't do today here.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_03
 Usually he can.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_03
 Usually he has no real constraints.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_01
 And the...

0:35:29	SPEAKER_01
 The NTL meeting moved to Wednesday because of...

0:35:32	SPEAKER_01
 There was just...

0:35:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you wanted to put...

0:35:34	SPEAKER_01
 But...

0:35:35	SPEAKER_01
 So if that's okay with you, you...

0:35:37	SPEAKER_02
 Is it staying basically at that Wednesday noon?

0:35:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it was...

0:35:40	SPEAKER_02
 I thought it was staying.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_05
 I thought it was just a week that we were changing.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_03
 And how do we feel about doing it Wednesday?

0:35:49	SPEAKER_03
 Because it seems to me that this is sort of a time where when we...

0:35:52	SPEAKER_03
 Have things to discuss with other people, they seem to be tons of people around.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_01
 The only disadvantage is that it may interfere with other...

0:36:02	SPEAKER_01
 Subgroup meetings.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_01
 You know, other...

0:36:05	SPEAKER_01
 No, people in this group connecting with...

0:36:07	SPEAKER_01
 Those people...

0:36:08	SPEAKER_01
 Those people...

0:36:09	SPEAKER_01
 Who might not be around so much.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_01
 I don't care.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_01
 You know, I have no fix.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_02
 I would like to avoid more than one ICSI meeting per day.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_02
 And passing over.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, I don't know.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_03
 No, that's fine.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_03
 I mean...

0:36:26	SPEAKER_03
 I'd like to have them all in one day.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_01
 I get to them often then.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_01
 People different their tastes in this matter.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_01
 I'm neutral.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_00
 Who's here anyways?

0:36:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but...

0:36:36	SPEAKER_01
 That's me too.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_03
 I'm basically I'm here.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_03
 One sort of thing is this room is taken after 3.30, pretty much every day by the data collection.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_03
 So we have subjects in here except for this week we have subjects in here.

0:36:49	SPEAKER_03
 That's why it was 1.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_03
 So we just knew...

0:36:52	SPEAKER_05
 Do you say that Ami can't make 1 o'clock?

0:36:54	SPEAKER_03
 No, he can.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_03
 So let's say Thursday 1.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_03
 But for next week this is a bit late.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_03
 So I would suggest that we need to talk...

0:37:04	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, okay.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_05
 We do Thursday at 1.30 with that...

0:37:08	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:37:11	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, really?

0:37:12	SPEAKER_03
 Because this room is again taken at 2.30 by Morgan.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:37:15	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, that's fine.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_03
 And the meeting recording meeting...

0:37:19	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_03
 Meeting recording on meeting meetings.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:37:24	SPEAKER_01
 So you propose that we meet Tuesday.

0:37:27	SPEAKER_01
 How about that?

0:37:28	SPEAKER_05
 I think...

0:37:29	SPEAKER_05
 We are meeting Tuesday.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_05
 I mean we usually meet Tuesday for...

0:37:32	SPEAKER_05
 I think we have a link list at 2.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_05
 So...

0:37:36	SPEAKER_05
 Do you want to meet again here?

0:37:38	SPEAKER_04
 Is the speech gen meeting still at on Tuesdays?

0:37:40	SPEAKER_03
 Well, actually we did scrap our Monday time just because...

0:37:43	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe I didn't need a scrap.

0:37:45	SPEAKER_03
 Come Monday.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_03
 So there is nothing synceding Monday anymore either.

0:37:49	SPEAKER_04
 Although I thought you wanted to go camping on Monday...

0:37:52	SPEAKER_04
 Or take off Mondays a lot so you could go camping.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_03
 That's another thing.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_03
 But I mean those are usually the holidays anyways.

0:38:01	SPEAKER_03
 Like usually.

0:38:02	SPEAKER_03
 Sometimes.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_03
 It works out that way.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:38:07	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I mean the linguist meeting happens to be at 2.

0:38:11	SPEAKER_05
 But I think that's...

0:38:12	SPEAKER_02
 It should be relatively flexible.

0:38:19	SPEAKER_05
 It's pretty flexible I think.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_02
 There's just sort of the...

0:38:23	SPEAKER_02
 The multiple-error meetings.

0:38:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_02
 And you know, of course Nancy and I are just sort of always talking anyway.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_02
 You do it in that room.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_03
 You know, I mean...

0:38:33	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so forget about the camping thing.

0:38:36	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:38:37	SPEAKER_03
 Any other problems?

0:38:39	SPEAKER_03
 I suggest that Monday.

0:38:40	SPEAKER_03
 If that's a problem for me then I shouldn't suggest it.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:38:45	SPEAKER_02
 All of the proposed times I'm trying to...

0:38:48	SPEAKER_01
 One day...

0:38:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, what I mean...

0:38:50	SPEAKER_01
 What I think we're just saying is that...

0:38:53	SPEAKER_01
 Early...

0:38:54	SPEAKER_01
 At least for next week there's a lot of stuff we want to get done.

0:38:56	SPEAKER_01
 So why don't we find the meet Monday and...

0:38:58	SPEAKER_01
 We'll see if we want to meet any more than that.

0:39:01	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:39:02	SPEAKER_00
 What time?

0:39:03	SPEAKER_00
 At...

0:39:04	SPEAKER_03
 One, two, three.

0:39:05	SPEAKER_03
 Three is too late.

0:39:06	SPEAKER_03
 Two third time.

0:39:07	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I...

0:39:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I actually...

0:39:09	SPEAKER_01
 Two is the earliest I can meet on Monday.

0:39:11	None
 Okay, two.

0:39:14	SPEAKER_01
 You're I'm blissfully agreeing to things in realizing that I actually do have some scuffle schedule on Monday's.

0:39:21	SPEAKER_05
 You guys look streamlined, right?

0:39:23	SPEAKER_04
 No way.

0:39:25	SPEAKER_05
 You'll come and take all the headphone first.

0:39:29	SPEAKER_05
 I'm a dead memory mind.

0:39:30	SPEAKER_03
 And...

0:39:31	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:39:32	SPEAKER_03
 Why do I have this and those I'm getting?

0:39:33	SPEAKER_03
 Do I get to see your formalism before that?

0:39:37	SPEAKER_05
 Uh...

0:39:38	SPEAKER_05
 Would you like to?

0:39:39	None
 Mm-hmm.

0:39:40	None
 Okay.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_03
 I was actually going to work on it for tomorrow.

0:39:44	SPEAKER_03
 Get a notion of what you guys have been told for me.

0:39:47	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can put this part of what we can do Monday if we want.

0:39:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:39:51	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I...

0:39:52	SPEAKER_05
 Some version.

0:39:53	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, so there was like, you know, in my head the goal to have like an intermediate version, like, everything I know.

0:39:59	SPEAKER_05
 And then I would talk to you and figure out everything you know.

0:40:02	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:40:03	SPEAKER_02
 But, you know, see if they're consistent.

0:40:04	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe you and I should meet sort of formalized first thing Monday.

0:40:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:40:07	SPEAKER_05
 That's fine with me, sir.

0:40:09	SPEAKER_05
 You said you're busy over until the weekend, right?

0:40:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, sort of through the weekend because Kate has a photography.

0:40:15	SPEAKER_02
 That's fine.

0:40:16	SPEAKER_05
 So we might continue our email thing that might be fine to you, sir.

0:40:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, if there's time after this, I'll show you the number.

0:40:23	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, that would be cool.

0:40:24	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:40:25	SPEAKER_05
 And we'll...

0:40:26	SPEAKER_03
 So the ideas on Monday and Tuesday will see an intermediate version of the formalism for the construction.

0:40:32	SPEAKER_03
 So that's okay for you.

0:40:33	SPEAKER_03
 And do an online merging with my Constoral ideas.

0:40:38	SPEAKER_03
 Sure.

0:40:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:40:40	SPEAKER_03
 Sure.

0:40:41	SPEAKER_03
 So it won't be like a, say my formal presentation of my proposal, it'll be more like towards finalizing that proposal.

0:40:47	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:40:50	SPEAKER_05
 Because then you'll find out more about what we're making you do.

0:40:53	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:40:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:40:55	SPEAKER_05
 And then we'll make a presentation of your proposal.

0:40:57	SPEAKER_03
 Perfect.

0:40:58	SPEAKER_03
 Can you also write it up?

0:40:59	SPEAKER_03
 So what we're doing and the complement is Robert.

0:41:01	SPEAKER_03
 I send you a staff file, right?

0:41:03	SPEAKER_03
 It's just...

0:41:04	SPEAKER_03
 I always send you my, my, my new files.

0:41:07	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:41:08	SPEAKER_03
 And...

0:41:11	SPEAKER_03
 So it's good.

0:41:13	SPEAKER_02
 So we should probably talk about the other side of the, where is X construction, which is the issue of, how do you simulate questions?

0:41:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:41:22	SPEAKER_02
 Does SimSpec look like for questions?

0:41:23	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:41:24	SPEAKER_02
 Because...

0:41:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:41:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:41:27	SPEAKER_02
 Now we had an idea for this, which seems like a problem.

0:41:28	SPEAKER_01
 Great.

0:41:29	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:41:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:41:31	SPEAKER_01
 SimSpec may need, we may need to rename that.

0:41:32	SPEAKER_01
 Oh yeah.

0:41:33	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:41:34	SPEAKER_01
 So let's think of a name for whatever the, his intermediate structure is.

0:41:37	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, we talked about SimSpec for some unexpected specification.

0:41:41	SPEAKER_01
 And that seems...

0:41:43	SPEAKER_01
 Uh...

0:41:44	SPEAKER_01
 You know...

0:41:45	SPEAKER_01
 You know, it's a minimal change.

0:41:47	SPEAKER_05
 When you change one vowel, it's great.

0:41:49	SPEAKER_05
 All the old like...

0:41:51	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:41:52	SPEAKER_05
...crabs just changed the...

0:41:53	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:41:54	SPEAKER_01
 You're a little substance to substance.

0:41:55	SPEAKER_01
 That's what text substitutes in Macros or for.

0:41:57	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway.

0:41:58	SPEAKER_01
 So let's, let's, for the moment, call it that until we think of something better.

0:42:02	SPEAKER_01
 And yeah, we absolutely need to find part of what was missing were markings of all sorts that weren't in there.

0:42:09	SPEAKER_01
 Including questions.

0:42:11	SPEAKER_01
 We never did figure out how we were going to do emphasis in...

0:42:15	SPEAKER_01
 In the SimSpec.

0:42:17	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, we talked a little bit about that too, which...

0:42:20	SPEAKER_05
 It's hard for me to figure out that sort of general linguistic issues, how they map onto this particular one, but...

0:42:27	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:42:28	SPEAKER_01
 That's part of the formalism has got to be...

0:42:31	SPEAKER_01
 How things like that get marked.

0:42:34	SPEAKER_05
 Do you have data like the... you have preliminary data?

0:42:39	SPEAKER_05
 Because I know, you know, we've been using this one, you see, sentence, and I'm sure you guys have...

0:42:43	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe you're the one who's been looking at the rest of it.

0:42:45	SPEAKER_05
 It'd be unusual for me if we wanted to have it a little bit more.

0:42:48	SPEAKER_02
 What I've been looking at...

0:42:49	SPEAKER_02
 No, it's not been the data so far.

0:42:50	SPEAKER_02
 I just sort of said, all right, let's see if I can get noun phrases and...

0:42:54	SPEAKER_02
 Major verb constructions out of the way first.

0:42:57	SPEAKER_02
 And I have not gotten them out of the way yet.

0:42:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I've not really approached a lot of the data, but I mean, obviously, like the question one, since we have this idea about the indefinite pronouncing and all that, you know, like, can try and run with that, you know, try and do some of the question constructions now.

0:43:16	SPEAKER_03
 You want to run the indefinite pronoun idea past Jerry?

0:43:19	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:43:20	SPEAKER_02
 The basic idea is that, you know, I would see...

0:43:25	SPEAKER_03
 So, very fixed the car with a wrench. So you're following me.

0:43:30	SPEAKER_03
 And then, who fixed the car with a wrench?

0:43:32	SPEAKER_03
 You basically are told to do this.

0:43:36	SPEAKER_03
 And elegantly, to the way you would do someone fixed the car with a wrench.

0:43:41	SPEAKER_03
 And then you hand it back to your hippocampus and find out what that means.

0:43:47	SPEAKER_03
 And then come up with that, who that someone was.

0:43:50	SPEAKER_02
 So, the WHO question has this sort of extra thing which says, and when you're done, tell me who fills that slot.

0:43:57	SPEAKER_02
 And, you know, this is sort of a nice way to do it.

0:43:59	SPEAKER_02
 The idea of sort of saying that you treat from the simulation point of view or whatever, you treat WHO constructions similarly to indefinite pronouns like someone fixed the car because lots of languages have WHO questions with an indefinite pronoun in CQ or whatever, and you just get an intonation to tell you that it's a question.

0:44:18	SPEAKER_01
 So, which is, school amazation.

0:44:22	SPEAKER_01
 In logic, it's, yeah.

0:44:25	SPEAKER_05
 It's a problem.

0:44:27	SPEAKER_05
 It's a problem constant in, yeah.

0:44:29	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:44:30	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:44:31	SPEAKER_01
 There's nothing that's bad.

0:44:32	SPEAKER_01
 Right, no.

0:44:33	SPEAKER_01
 The logicians have...

0:44:36	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:44:37	SPEAKER_02
 It makes sense from that point of view too, which is actually better.

0:44:41	SPEAKER_02
 Anyway, but just that kind of thing, and we'll figure out exactly how to write that up and so on.

0:44:45	SPEAKER_02
 I know all the focus stuff.

0:44:51	SPEAKER_02
 You sort of just dropped that because it was too weird, and we didn't even know like when we were talking about it.

0:44:57	SPEAKER_02
 That's the top of it.

0:44:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:44:59	SPEAKER_01
 Well, part of what the exercise is, but in the next week, you say, what are the things that we just don't have answers for yet?

0:45:07	SPEAKER_01
 That's fine.

0:45:08	SPEAKER_03
 Well, if you do want to discuss focus background, then get me into that because I mean, I've scientifically worked on that for almost two years.

0:45:22	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:45:23	SPEAKER_02
 And certainly...

0:45:24	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, you should definitely be on that.

0:45:26	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe by after Monday, you could see what things we...

0:45:30	SPEAKER_02
 I think we'll figure out what our questions are, for example.

0:45:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:45:33	SPEAKER_02
 To ask you.

0:45:34	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:45:43	SPEAKER_01
 Then, Hans.

0:45:45	SPEAKER_01
 I haven't seen Hans, but...

0:45:47	SPEAKER_01
 It's been around.

0:45:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:45:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:45:50	SPEAKER_01
 So has he been involved with this or...?

0:45:51	SPEAKER_01
 With us?

0:45:52	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:45:53	SPEAKER_05
 I would say that those discussions have been primarily Keith and me, but...

0:46:00	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, he sort of... the last meeting we had, I think we were all very much part of it.

0:46:06	SPEAKER_02
 But...

0:46:07	SPEAKER_02
 Sometimes, Hans has been sort of coming in there as sort of like a devil's advocate, like role or something like this.

0:46:12	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to pretend I'm a linguist who has nothing to do with this.

0:46:14	SPEAKER_02
 This makes no sense, and he'll just go off on parts of it, which definitely need fixing, but aren't where we're at right now.

0:46:20	SPEAKER_05
 Like, what you call certain things, which we decided along, go, we don't care that much right now.

0:46:24	SPEAKER_05
 But in the sense, it's good to know that he, of all people, like maybe a lot of people would have...

0:46:29	SPEAKER_05
 He's a stronger reaction, so he's like a relatively friendly linguist, and yet, word like constraint, because there are a lot of problems.

0:46:36	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:46:37	SPEAKER_01
 This is consistent with the role I had suggested that he play, which was that...

0:46:51	SPEAKER_01
 One of the things I would like to see happen is a paper that was tentatively called, towards a formal cognitive semantics, which was addressed to these linguists who haven't been following this stuff at all.

0:47:10	SPEAKER_01
 So, it could be that he's actually, at some level, thinking about how am I going to communicate this story?

0:47:18	SPEAKER_01
 So, internally, we should just do whatever works, because it's hard enough.

0:47:24	SPEAKER_01
 But if he is really going to turn around and help to write this version that does connect with as many as possible of the other linguists in the world, then it becomes important to use terminology that doesn't...

0:47:47	SPEAKER_01
 Make it hard... I mean, it's going to be plenty hard for people to understand that his idea is...

0:47:53	SPEAKER_01
 But you don't want to make it worse.

0:47:56	SPEAKER_02
 Right, I mean, that role is indispensable, but that's not where sort of our heads were at in this meeting.

0:48:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah, no, that's fine. I just wanted to...

0:48:05	SPEAKER_01
 I have to catch up with him, and I wanted to get a feeling from that.

0:48:09	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:48:10	SPEAKER_02
 So, I don't know what his take will be on these meetings.

0:48:12	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:48:13	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:48:15	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's good to know that we're talking about your govily.

0:48:18	SPEAKER_05
 When we're into data and looking at the some specific linguistic phenomenon in English, or in German, particular word effort, that's great.

0:48:26	SPEAKER_05
 And Hans, if anything, they have more say than I'd say I would about these things.

0:48:31	SPEAKER_05
 But when it's like, well, how do we capture these things?

0:48:34	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's definitely been Keith and I have...

0:48:37	SPEAKER_05
 Well, that's good.

0:48:38	SPEAKER_01
 I think that should be the court group, and that's, you know, I think very close to the maximum number of people working together that you've got.

0:48:51	SPEAKER_05
 We actually have... I think we have been making progress.

0:48:53	SPEAKER_05
 I definitely get the impression.

0:48:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's great.

0:48:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:48:57	SPEAKER_05
 So, anyone else?

0:48:59	SPEAKER_05
 We're in the balance, anyway.

0:49:02	SPEAKER_01
 Well, then we have to come back to the bigger group.

0:49:06	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:49:08	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:49:09	SPEAKER_01
 And we're going to...

0:49:10	SPEAKER_01
 Because this other big thing we haven't talked about is actually implementing this stuff.

0:49:15	SPEAKER_01
 So they guess the three of us are going to connect tomorrow.

0:49:17	SPEAKER_05
 I was just going to say that, for instance, there was, you know, out of a meeting with John O.

0:49:21	SPEAKER_05
 Came the suggestion that, oh, could it be that the meaning constraints really aren't used for selection, which has sort of been implicit in the parsing strategy we talked about.

0:49:31	SPEAKER_05
 In which case, we can just say that they're the effects or the bindings, which, so far, in terms of like putting up all the constraints as, you know, pushing them into type constraints, when I then propose it to the linguist who haven't yet given me, you know, we haven't yet thought of a reason why that wouldn't work.

0:49:47	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:49:48	SPEAKER_05
 As long as we allow our type constraints to be reasonably complex.

0:49:51	SPEAKER_05
 Well, anyway.

0:49:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it has to, in the sense that you're going to use them eventually. So, you know, it's sort of a generating test kind of thing.

0:50:03	SPEAKER_01
 And if you over-generate, then you'll have to do more.

0:50:06	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, if there are some constraints that you hold back and don't use in your initial matching, and you'll match some things.

0:50:15	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I don't think there's any way that it could completely fail. It could be that you wind up many.

0:50:22	SPEAKER_01
 The original bad idea of purely context free grammars died because there were just vastly too many parses, you know, exponentially number many parses.

0:50:34	SPEAKER_01
 And so that the concern might be that nothing would totally fail that that would still generate too many.

0:50:41	SPEAKER_05
 Right. So, Joe, by just having semantic, bringing semantics in, for matching just in the form of semantic types.

0:50:48	SPEAKER_05
 Like, conceptually, these have to be construed as this, this, and this.

0:50:51	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:50:52	SPEAKER_05
 Might still give us quite a few possibilities.

0:50:54	SPEAKER_05
 We don't know.

0:50:55	SPEAKER_05
 And it certainly helps a lot.

0:50:57	SPEAKER_01
 No question.

0:50:58	SPEAKER_01
 And I think it's a perfectly fine place to start, you know, and say, let's see how far we can go this way.

0:51:06	SPEAKER_01
 And, uh, well, it definitely makes the problem easier.

0:51:11	SPEAKER_01
 I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm into that.

0:51:12	SPEAKER_01
 Because I think, I think it's, as you know, I think it's real hard and if we, if, all right.

0:51:24	SPEAKER_05
 So, Friday, Monday, Monday.

0:51:28	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:51:29	SPEAKER_05
 Okay. That's Tuesday.

0:51:31	SPEAKER_05
 That's the, here, question.

0:51:33	SPEAKER_03
 So, you, your dance card is, you did it.

0:51:38	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah. And I've nothing to do this weekend, but work.

0:51:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:51:43	SPEAKER_05
 What about, what about DDR?

0:51:44	SPEAKER_05
 Uh, I don't have it this weekend, so don't have to worry about that.

0:51:48	SPEAKER_05
 DDR.

0:51:49	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:51:50	SPEAKER_05
 Dancing, dance revolution.

0:51:52	SPEAKER_05
 It's a, it's like a game, but it's for like dancing.

0:51:57	SPEAKER_05
 It's hard to, it's like karaoke, but for dancing.

0:52:00	SPEAKER_05
 And they tell you what.

0:52:02	SPEAKER_05
 It's amazing.

0:52:03	SPEAKER_05
 It's so much fun.

0:52:04	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, yeah.

0:52:05	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:52:06	SPEAKER_05
 So, my friend has a home version.

0:52:07	SPEAKER_05
 He brought it over and we are so into it.

0:52:10	SPEAKER_05
 It's so amazing.

0:52:11	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, yeah.

0:52:12	SPEAKER_05
 Now, this, what you, you know of it?

0:52:15	SPEAKER_05
 It's, it's one of your hobbies.

0:52:17	SPEAKER_01
 Although, I, God knows I could do something.

0:52:20	SPEAKER_05
 It's great exercise, I must say.

0:52:22	SPEAKER_01
 But, uh, no, I, I can't wait to hear.

0:52:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:52:32	SPEAKER_01
 Apparently, always the hottest thing in Tokyo.

0:52:35	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, definitely.

0:52:36	SPEAKER_05
 They have like places instead of like, instead of karaoke bars, now they have like DDR.

0:52:39	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I didn't until I started hanging out with this friend who was like, oh, I can bring over the DDR if you want.

0:52:46	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, dance, dance revolution.

0:52:47	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:52:48	SPEAKER_05
 He actually brought a clone called stepping selection, but it's just as good.

0:52:52	SPEAKER_05
 Hey.

0:53:22	None
 You You You You You You You You You You You You
