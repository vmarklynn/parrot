0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 I mean if you were late to that, it's not.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_02
 We'll find a way around it.

0:00:06	SPEAKER_02
 And I've put you guys on Mondays at this time for my convenience, but it's not like it's important.

0:00:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, well, I was expecting to get, yeah, I didn't make it in time, but it's just because of all the leaves and things.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_00
 The trains weren't stopping at the stations.

0:00:19	SPEAKER_00
 So there's like those beach restrictions on.

0:00:20	SPEAKER_03
 It's a sliding pass.

0:00:21	SPEAKER_03
 You really?

0:00:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:00:23	SPEAKER_01
 Great.

0:00:24	SPEAKER_00
 So what do they have to do back up?

0:00:26	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure. The van ended up busting people into... I think it's a quite stationary. I have particularly problems on it.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_00
 It's on a hill or something.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_00
 So I had to bust people in from stations either side.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_00
 Masty.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, yes. But at least it was speed restrictions instead of trains flying past into barriers and things.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:00:45	SPEAKER_02
 We're glad they look after that bit.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_01
 What?

0:00:59	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know. Do we want to look at anything? It's not up yet.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_03
 Still.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_03
 56% of the city.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_03
 I can skip it.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_03
 Isn't it just doing a disc jaker?

0:01:11	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what it's doing.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_02
 Oops. I love... it doesn't like silk.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_02
 Stay.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_02
 And now we're going to discover we've got no reason to meet, right?

0:01:32	SPEAKER_02
 Because everything's going swimmingly.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_03
 Is everything going to...

0:01:37	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I mean, if I've got a problem, I'm waiting for the get-a-get-camp-tager slide, right?

0:01:43	SPEAKER_02
 Because I haven't read the wikis in my email since I left.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I haven't added anything to the wiki recently.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_00
 So I've been working on trying to get the XML stuff working.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm basically learning how to get the DOM works, so I can do the next... so I can generate the DDF files.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_00
 So, yeah, so just briefly read through the documentation that was doing in the last week.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_00
 Just so I know how it all works and I'm hoping I have the best way to do things.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_00
 But at the moment, I'm playing about the DOM stuff in Mozilla.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_00
 Because just so I can see how it works with the HTML pages so I can generate the XML stuff and see how it all works there.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_00
 It's just with my choose to just see how things work in that.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I don't know the Mozilla stuff, so if it turns out that it's idiosyncratic in some way that teaches you funny habits, then it won't have been a good idea.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I think the API is standardized by the W3C.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_00
 So the API is standard between everything.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_02
 Well, there are certain companies that I don't want to name who don't always get it right.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah, Mozilla, yeah, it'll be all right.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_00
 It's just a couple of...

0:02:57	SPEAKER_00
 I believe you know, it's a good strategy.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_00
 Well, yeah, but it does like you said, but this is a Mozilla-only feature, and things like that.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_00
 So I've been avoiding those anyway.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_00
 It's just that that's quite a quick way to just to get into how it works because I can just quickly generate a web page and just add things to it and take things away and see exactly what's going on at the time.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_02
 Why does it help for the HTML?

0:03:21	SPEAKER_02
 Just XML?

0:03:22	SPEAKER_00
 Just because XHTML has a nice, you know, that you've got roses there so you can actually see directly what's going on.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_02
 So the first thing I want to do is just to make sure that you're using XML file up in it.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_00
 It'll just apply some default styles to it anyway that shows you...

0:03:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, well, I'm using XHTML to do all the web pages of XHTML.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_00
 So it's XML just with the HTML DTD.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, yeah.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_00
 Just because you haven't quite finalized the GDF format.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so you're going to have to do a swap-in tag names later?

0:03:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_00
 So all I have to do is change that sort of thing.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure if I'm always doing this.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sure that's fine.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to...

0:04:01	SPEAKER_03
 It comes out in the end.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, no, I'm just trying to think of the things that could go wrong.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_02
 But since I haven't tried it this particular way, you know...

0:04:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that sounds good.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_02
 So you say we haven't finalized what the GDF looks like.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_02
 Is that an implicit request for me to do something?

0:04:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, well, what I'm doing in the moment, I'm looking through the stuff that's growing in the wiki to say what we need in the output format for the task.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_00
 So what are you going to do the analysis on?

0:04:35	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm making sure that I can get that information out of the GDF as it's stated at the moment.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_00
 If I find something that you can't get out of it, then I can add that to the GDF format.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, well, I mean, there's two cases in here, right?

0:04:48	SPEAKER_02
 There's things you can get straight off the original format.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_02
 And then there's things you have to do some kind of post-processed signal of the original format.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_02
 But it's not just data format changes, actually, some kind of computational process to get the thing out of it as well, right?

0:05:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_02
 And it wasn't... I think it was a little bit confused last time we spoke about whether you consider GDF format to be the thing that's just straightforward translations of what's in the original eye-tracking output, or whether...

0:05:18	SPEAKER_02
...like, whether the post-processing utilities are a separate step.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_02
 Because I think you and I had separate different views on this, but I can't remember who had which view at this point.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, well...

0:05:29	SPEAKER_02
 So are you working actively on these analysis things, or are you just working on the translation?

0:05:34	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I'm making sure that the GDF format we've got in the moment will output the old analysis that Robin's looking for.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm using it as a way to get into using the DOM things as well.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_00
 So at the moment, I'm looking at actually the GDF format itself.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_00
 And then to generate the GDF format, I'm going to be taking stuff out of the just analyzer, and then using the DOM parser to generate X-mar, the just analyzer.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, okay, so you have an ability to have what's in there and what isn't in there that you need to do some really intensive transform to do?

0:06:05	SPEAKER_02
 Not yet.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, but the output of the just analyzer does do some of the processing already, which is all trying to use that as the basis for it.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_00
 Because that already picks up target read and things like that.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_00
 So it knows whether you're looking at a part, or whether you're looking at target area, or whatever.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_00
 So yeah, so there's also got that in it somewhere.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_00
 So it's just a matter of pulling that out and putting that into the GDF.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so this sounds like it's under control when you're happy and you guys are telling each other what you guys need to know.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_02
 So I don't need to do anything, right?

0:06:36	SPEAKER_02
 Nope.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_02
 You're all fine.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_02
 But there was a number of things that came before this, right?

0:06:41	SPEAKER_02
 It sounds like they're not under control yet.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_02
 So, you know, the GDF stuff, so Ellen's view on this is we go through everything in order, like the priority is exactly the pipeline order.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_02
 So Camtasia, you mentioned.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_02
 And I'm not sure what else, but we should check what other things were before this on the list of things to do.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, I think the other thing I've got left to leave before the expense of me run is get the check Camtasia works.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_00
 Now, we've got Camtasia running on machines, and I think they're set up correctly, but I can't test it until we get the microphones working.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_00
 Until you get the microphones.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, microphones.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_03
 It's batteries we're waiting for.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_03
 Batteries.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_03
 They're due, I was told the beginning this week.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_02
 Are they really, really strange batteries?

0:07:26	SPEAKER_03
 They are quite strange.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_03
 Have you tried Mappler?

0:07:29	SPEAKER_03
 It's, um, April has ordered them from someplace.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_03
 I've extended them.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_03
 No, well, like 150 each or something like that.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_02
 Because, you know, like we bus journey over to Mapplin might solve the problem if it's getting in the way.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_03
 Well, hopefully they should have been here last week, but Caroline then joined up to chase them.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_03
 And we're told to be here.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_03
 It should be today.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_02
 So this isn't actually learning your schedule for anything, and that's why you're waiting.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we can still test whether Camtasia runs anyway.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_03
 It's just the, whether it's the microphones are picking up things correctly.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_02
 So it sounds like you're not actually worried about the fact that this is...

0:08:13	SPEAKER_02
 Not yet.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_02
 When you get worried, go to Mapplin.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_02
 Phone them first to make sure that they're in there.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_02
 Somebody around must have a...

0:08:22	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, Steve.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_02
 Somebody in the techie group will have a map on catalogue.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_02
 But I'll see if I can...

0:08:28	SPEAKER_02
 It's useful to know who's got a current one anyway.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_02
 I don't seem to get them anymore.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_02
 I guess they don't buy enough equipment.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it must have stopped online these days anyways, no?

0:08:41	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_02
 Of course.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_02
 Duh.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_02
 So you can find out whether they have it.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_02
 But you'd have to phone them to find out if they haven't been stopped on that.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_02
 I actually live not that far from that.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_02
 So it would be a half hour diversion from my morning routine to pick up stuff.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_02
 But then again, it's also very close to a hay market.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_02
 So it's even less of a diversion for you, probably, except you don't know your way around.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_00
 I can easily get to Mapplin.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_00
 And I don't worry about his stuff.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_00
 I used to live in a hay market.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_00
 I used to live here on my geek.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_00
 I know we're doing it.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_02
 I know we're Mapplin.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_02
 I just think, well, you know, for the sake of three quid or however many quid.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_02
 How many batteries does it take?

0:09:30	SPEAKER_03
 Doesn't take a hundred.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's two batteries we need.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_02
 Then, you know, put your mind at rest.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_02
 You know, you wouldn't want it to be the morning you were supposed to be recording.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_02
 That's what this guy is.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_00
 You know this.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_00
 What's about the...

0:09:44	SPEAKER_00
 I could give you a call on the way in tomorrow.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_00
 It's not paid in your pigeonhole lock.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_00
 You got off the train early and just pick them up from there.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I checked they got them first though.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_02
 Their stocks are a bit funny down there.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_00
 Right, yeah.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I'm making it and making sure I've got the phone number on my phone so I can call them.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_02
 Because, you know, it's not that attractive an area to walk through if you're not going to get any of the photo tips.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_00
 Well, true.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_00
 True.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_00
 That's the way I rode, isn't it?

0:10:12	SPEAKER_02
 So, of all the things that were on the wiki, do I need to pull up the wiki?

0:10:17	SPEAKER_02
 It's going to let me log in.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_03
 It's still probably in that angle.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_02
 No, I do not want to change my password.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_02
 But you guys probably know off the top of your head.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_02
 Is there anything else that we were waiting on before you could run?

0:10:45	SPEAKER_03
 I remember.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_03
 So, all those tasks break out.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_03
 The only thing that's holding me slightly up is checking whether to finish the working model builder.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_03
 But I'm not sure if it's finished version yet.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_02
 His last day was the 31st of October.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, he still had hours left.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_03
 I wasn't sure if it was down to the number of hours or where the 31st of October.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_02
 No, it's hours.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's hours.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, so he's got hours left.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_02
 He's behind him.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_02
 I think he was filling for the hour.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_02
 So, I thought, well, I mean, obviously, if he wants to finish off, then, you know.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_03
 But, I've nine Megan has gone dead for almost the last two weeks.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, well, they're fully away, then.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_02
 Wasn't that one away?

0:11:40	SPEAKER_02
 They're really the same way?

0:11:41	SPEAKER_03
 No, but I think what they had was some big review.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah, it could be it.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_03
 And so I haven't heard anything back from them.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_03
 So the models for...

0:11:52	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, you have no models at all.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, that's a pity.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_02
 Model builder.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_02
 That's what I was calling the graphical model editor, right?

0:12:01	SPEAKER_02
 So you use expert to make the parts and then you...

0:12:04	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we don't need to make the parts or all the standard 10 gram ones.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_03
 They're not before anyway.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_03
 The big thing is only when we come to building airplanes and new peculiar shapes.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_03
 But for this experiment, it's just a 10 gram type task.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_02
 I have something in my email about from Joe.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_02
 He wouldn't have sent it just to me, would he?

0:12:29	SPEAKER_02
 Do you want me to check that?

0:12:30	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not going to project my email.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_03
 I'll say that one away.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_03
 I recently did nothing per day anything from Joe for a week or so anyway.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, I think I might have heard Thursday or something.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_02
 I can't remember.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_03
 Is that what it was?

0:12:46	SPEAKER_03
 I think it was the last thing that was in response to the thing I was seeing last week, a bit of the parallel gram being the little me round from the model.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I saw some screenshots.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_03
 Nothing has heard anything since from either.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_03
 I'll say the Netherlands or from you.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so I've got something on the 28th.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_02
 That's Friday, I think.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, he just wants to know how to get paid.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_02
 Right, that's a guess he's done, done, done.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_02
 Anyway, he's in Adam's breast.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_02
 So, well, I suppose he won't come back.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_02
 This Kirk's on his desk.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_03
 It was he back?

0:13:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_02
 So, I'm using the nice machine.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_00
 So, he wants to pop in for five minutes.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_00
 The Windows machines.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_00
 Free from at the moment.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_00
 It's just not going to trigger.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_02
 Squat there, that's all.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_02
 So, the last thing I got from him about work work was the 19th of October that said he uploaded some changes that you wanted.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_02
 That's, oh, see, you didn't get that.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_02
 It was just me and him, but presumably he put it on the wiki.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_02
 So, he's just telling us because he thinks we've all we don't read wikis.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_02
 And I'll just check.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_03
 It was after that.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_03
 It was the thing about why the power level gram was a mirror image.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_00
 I'll consider him to get an email off whom I think it got sent to the group saying that he'd updated the whatever it was on the wiki.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_00
 So, he'd uploaded a new zip file and never written the old one.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I haven't replied to him about, yeah, I really don't have anything more recent from him.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_02
 I haven't replied to him about how to submit costs and stuff like that.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_02
 But that suggests he's at the end of things, but we could just ask him.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, maybe you guys would just want to ask him directly, you're done done, right?

0:15:05	SPEAKER_02
 Because that's what you guys know.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_02
 And then, of course, any problems that remain you inherit.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_02
 But, you know, it's worth taking a look at what it does and making sure it does what you want, I guess.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_02
 So, the problem is you wanted to construct some models in it for you experiment, but you were hoping to get some from Marlous.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, or at least she was meant to have some idea of the level of complexity because they have actually run things and to get an idea of the sort of style and to check that would be alright.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_03
 All very quiet.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_02
 Right, have you tried cold calling?

0:15:40	SPEAKER_02
 That's what I do when I need things that...

0:15:43	SPEAKER_03
 No, it has just been email rather than a telephone type.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 I'm a trash stone.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_02
 If you get him today, when are you going to start running?

0:16:00	SPEAKER_03
 I'm down for a week.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_03
 What's the seventh?

0:16:04	SPEAKER_03
 A week to the event?

0:16:06	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, right, so you have to be ready by then.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_03
 We're hot.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_03
 We haven't booked anybody in or anything, but that's when I'm hoping.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_03
 Right, okay.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_03
 We have been, of course, put back a bit by Tracker going down.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, makes sense.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_03
 But we're certainly needing some data in the bag by the first of December, I think.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so you don't have subjects lined up, but you don't expect any trouble getting them?

0:16:37	SPEAKER_03
 Hopefully not.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_03
 The only other slight complication is, which I think will be brought up by the meeting on Thursday.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_03
 For all the eye tracking users.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_03
 The lab has been blocked booted again.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_03
 By?

0:16:58	SPEAKER_03
 Jules from Psychology.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know this person.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_02
 They, well, they need to be serious about it.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_02
 Is that a staff member or a student?

0:17:14	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, well, we kind of paid for the lab, so it depends, but I suppose talking to them sometimes solves these problems.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_02
 It depends on what sort of staff member is it?

0:17:27	SPEAKER_03
 A lecturer.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, presumably he or she is not running subjects the entire...

0:17:34	SPEAKER_03
 Well, presumably not, but it's sort of...

0:17:37	SPEAKER_03
 Buckle for how long?

0:17:38	SPEAKER_03
 For certainly, what, 60s?

0:17:45	SPEAKER_03
 10 to 5 for 2 or 3 of those days?

0:17:50	SPEAKER_02
 So, Ellen's still out of town, right?

0:17:54	SPEAKER_02
 It's just...

0:17:56	SPEAKER_02
 You could try calling this person a C.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_02
 How this works.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_02
 Ellen might be more persuasive.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_02
 Just sometimes academic staff have a bit of a chip about research staff.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_02
 And since I don't know the person, I can't tell whether it's one of those or not.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_03
 I wouldn't...

0:18:13	SPEAKER_03
 No, I can probably at least email her and ask her if she's really giving it all that time.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and then escalate, I guess.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_02
 But, you know, or whether it can be put off for a little bit or something.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_02
 So, I have no idea how the booking system works.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_02
 Well, you're discussing them Thursday, right?

0:18:34	SPEAKER_02
 At the moment, it's just a booking system.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_03
 People just, if they can log on to it, can book it.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yep.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that's one of the rays of the meeting.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_02
 I might talk to Ellen about that ahead of time, because she and Martin may have had discussions about appropriate use of the lab.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_03
 In theory, Jess is meant to have it every morning.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, really?

0:18:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but don't you guys set up for...isn't block booking more appropriate?

0:19:02	SPEAKER_02
 Because isn't there set up involved in changing around for somebody else?

0:19:07	SPEAKER_03
 Um...

0:19:11	SPEAKER_03
 There shouldn't be any changes in the physical connection.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_02
 No, or in the software or anything.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_02
 Nope.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, okay.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_02
 So there's no cost associated with it being mornings or afternoons?

0:19:24	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_03
 As long as other people don't, for some reason, I don't know, disconnect some bits of the equipment.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_03
 There's no reason why it should exist.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_02
 So, in the worst case, you may be able to make an argument if you actually need that week that you can collect in the mornings that week.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_02
 Is this something that's known outside Ellen's head?

0:19:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, it's on the booking system.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_03
 It's not on the booking system.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_03
 It's on our webpage that Frank created a big lab.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, well, that sounds like...

0:19:54	SPEAKER_03
 But you don't know if anybody actually knows who's there.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_02
 Uh-huh.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that's the time to...yeah.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_02
 So it sounds like you've got a lot of possible ways of getting what time you need.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_02
 Of course, try to be kind to other people.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 But you would anyway.

0:20:10	None
 Yeah.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_02
 So those are the only things that are worrying you.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_02
 Camtasia and lab access and otherwise.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_03
 No sweat.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_03
 You're happy.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_03
 You should be.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_03
 I've also got to get Camtasia.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_03
 The model builders here.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_03
 Well, yes.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_03
 The model, I've got to get Camtasia working as a sort of little multimedia thing to generate a video how to sort of an instructional video.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_02
 Uh-huh.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_02
 This is going to take a little while.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_03
 I have to do this week.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_00
 Well, hopefully once it goes around the trial, I'll give you some screenshots to work with and then it just may not have added any video of makes movements or whatever.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but you were going to try and figure out how to overlay something on top of the video that...

0:21:00	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, no, you were just really going to run a video of the set of the trial.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_02
 That's much easier.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_02
 So with the model builder, what do you need to do with it?

0:21:12	SPEAKER_02
 Which one of you is going to look at what it does so far?

0:21:16	SPEAKER_02
 I'll just try and do that.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_00
 Have a look.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_00
 If you're learning from it, things will be key page up for that piece of, let me know for that thing.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_00
 So just put whatever recommendations, bugs on that page and work through them as and when I can.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_03
 Hopefully there's not a problem.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_03
 Let's say Marlou was also meant to be doing things.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_02
 How many models were you relying on her for?

0:21:45	SPEAKER_02
 So are you suddenly going to be...

0:21:47	SPEAKER_03
 It hasn't been divided up in that sort of way.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_02
 Well, what I'm trying to get at is, is your start time going to be delayed because you don't have the models ready if she doesn't come through?

0:21:55	SPEAKER_03
 It depends how quickly I manage to get a group of it, maybe how long it takes me to generate them or how I get on with the Camtasia.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_02
 Well...

0:22:07	SPEAKER_03
 I'm unsure of yet.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_02
 Can you draft Craigin to build something necessary?

0:22:14	SPEAKER_00
 I've used this software in this life.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_00
 Not that hard.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_03
 It shouldn't be any great problem.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_03
 It's just checking that there are a suitable level of complexity.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_02
 You know me, contingency planning, obviously.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_02
 Of course, we're about to work.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, no, quite right.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I can't imagine the building the model is going to be that hard.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_00
 I can easily just have many thousands there on that Dutch website you found.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_00
 Just pick some of them, readied them in the GCD format.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_00
 That's pretty mechanical.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_00
 I can easily do that.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_00
 It's a matter of choosing which ones you need to do, which I guess you have to do.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I was hoping for some...

0:23:00	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_00
 You and my loads needed.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_02
 You can call a just telecom between you and Marlous.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_02
 If it's not...

0:23:11	SPEAKER_02
 See, with the call calling, you can usually at least find out whether they're alive and get an offer to get something.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_02
 But the next escalation is saying, no, we really need to talk about this.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_02
 We're going to talk about it Tuesday at such a time, unless you...

0:23:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_03
 It's a good time.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_03
 I'll try and get whoever we're going to do.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_02
 But presumably, whatever it is they've been going through is now over.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_03
 I think it was up to the end of October.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_03
 So presumably today they're now pre-

0:23:55	SPEAKER_02
 It's not like sitting there brain deadly constructing some models that she needs to do. It's just provided advice about this, which must take less time.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that all sounds fun.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_02
 You guys worried about anything?

0:24:21	SPEAKER_02
 We've mostly been talking about the experiment schedule.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think so.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_00
 The major thing I've got to do is get this campaign sorted out.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_00
 So just going with the batteries for that.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_00
 If I'm not worried, I'm not worried.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_02
 You're going to run out of things to do that we haven't set you up for any time soon.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_00
 The GDF thing sounds like it might take a wee while.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, because I'll get a finalize out format.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_00
 Then once that's done, I'll start looking at the analysis side of it.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_03
 All the dynamic region part of it.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_02
 But you don't need anything for me for that because that's already a sort of spec.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, again, that's the pair of you.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think the analysis will take a little while.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think it's going to take that long to get this stuff sorted out.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_00
 It's going to be head of display and all that sort of stuff.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_00
 Whatever makes it easiest for you to do.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_02
 This is what I'm worried about is him being in the lab all day long and you not being sure like what to do for the analysis or something.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_02
 Because you're going to be completely unavailable when you're recording, or will there be times when you don't record all day?

0:25:21	SPEAKER_03
 No, well, it depends how many I can begin and get running before my brain melts.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_03
 But when the experiment's running, yeah, it's I'll be in the lab.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because he might.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_02
 I can't just go in and let them get started.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah, no, no, I understood that.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_02
 It sounds like people can, but...

0:25:41	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, it was more like, you know, so this week he's got the GDF stuff to do.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_02
 Then next week you're planning on recording.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_02
 And what happens if suddenly you're unavailable all of next week, just 20 runs out of work?

0:25:53	SPEAKER_03
 There'll certainly be time for now because I'm right next to the lab.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_03
 Anybody will come back just to check my email and things anyway.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_03
 So what were you about it then?

0:26:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so I've also got to work on the dress analyzing and turn that into a GDF outputter.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I can have a look at my model builder as well.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_00
 One thing we're thinking about is we're looking at the part building type stuff.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_00
 And it might be worth seeing if I can add a little part builder thing into the model builder.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just going to tidy up on the code for generating the parts anyway, the JCT part.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_00
 Don't know what we want to bother with a part builder.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_02
 The idea was it wasn't worth the investment.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_00
 But I want to have a quick look at it and see how easy it is to add a couple of things to it.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_00
 Because if I can use it to generate the ROTC angle, for example, the rotation symmetry stuff for it, which of what was called as in the bugs before.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_00
 So if I can use the model builder to automatically do that, then that would save quite a bit of work and save a few bugs.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but now that the guy building these models know that they need to do the ROTC stuff.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_02
 Do you have trouble doing it?

0:26:56	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_00
 It's just something you've got to remember once the parts we built.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I mean, we might want to severely cash limit the investment that you put into making a part builder.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_02
 How many person days would it be worth?

0:27:14	SPEAKER_02
 If Craig discovered it could be done in X days.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_03
 I wouldn't bother more than one or two, certainly.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_02
 So there's a limit.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_02
 Don't spend more than a day or two on it.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_02
 You have to understand there's things about this project we didn't give you so far that you'll have to learn about.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_00
 So something like a map task, like let me further down my task list.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, really? Oh, that would just be a little add-on.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_02
 Whatever it is, it'll be the same skills as you've learned for something else.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_02
 And it'll just be, I'm not even sure that's you because I think somebody else is doing that, actually.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_02
 But I'm thinking more of the fact that at some point we should probably tell you about this NXT stuff.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_02
 Right. Yeah.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that's just X about X and L, isn't it?

0:27:58	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_00
 What other bits into NXT?

0:28:00	SPEAKER_02
 Well, you know, there's XML and XML and, you know, it takes standoff links and stuff.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_02
 And it's some people, if they're not used to linguistic annotation, take a little time to get their head around the way the data model works.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_00
 You know, there's stuff to learn there.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_00
 The form I've heard about it is both XML.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_00
 So the programming side of it doesn't sound too hard.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_00
 It's going to be making sure that it fits what you expect out the format.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_00
 But that's fine.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_00
 I'll have plenty of questions for you once I get to that stage, I'm sure.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_02
 So just don't whiter away, you know, weeks on for breeze when we got the real meat.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_02
 We did this yet to come.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_02
 Well, fine.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_02
 Plenty of really, really crucial things for you to do.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_03
 I do think you'll be twiddling your homes.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we'll do the thing.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to get camped out this week and it's constrained on the jazz analyzer, the GDF stuff.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_00
 And then, yeah, once we've done that, it's whatever you want me to do.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_00
 Once I've done the GDF.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. So I'll remind myself to look at what's next before the next time we get together.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm going to go to the GDF and click me busy for a little while yet.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_00
 So, yeah.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that's not the thing.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to get into this next week and then I can start suggesting things that might need to look at for the next stage.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_02
 So you're collecting Monday.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_02
 That means you don't want to meet, right?

0:29:25	SPEAKER_03
 Um, well, at 12 o'clock.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_03
 So next Monday, the lab is taking the book to pay.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_03
 Jules.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, right. It's actually next week.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_02
 It's actually the week that you were planning on.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_03
 It starts the on with this Wednesday and goes through to next Wednesday.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, okay.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I don't know.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_02
 Anyway, you'll tell me whether we cancel this or whether I just talked to Craig.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_02
 I wish we won't be up here because we don't record twos.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_03
 Perfect.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_03
 Um, what else?

0:30:05	SPEAKER_03
 Uh, yeah.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_03
 Why then other complication is two weeks tomorrow, I start my teaching.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_02
 That's pretty fun.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_02
 Let's see.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_03
 That's like four lectures and four labs.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_02
 That comes at an ideal time for you then.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_02
 That's like the 20th or something.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_02
 Uh, I can't add.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_03
 Uh, what's the worries?

0:30:30	SPEAKER_03
 Uh, tomorrow the first.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_03
 For the first year.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_03
 So it'll be the 15th.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_00
 Two weeks.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, yeah, that reminds me a lot about what I want to be.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_00
 Uh, on Thursday, I'm going to be over in the end of the day.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, you find your best.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_03
 And that's right.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_02
 You have to promise to tell us how that is.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_02
 Cause people do ask me.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_00
 Fair enough.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_00
 Fair enough.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think it's going to be a bad idea.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_03
 It's going to waste of time to, you know, it's going to be one to seven.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think it's going to be that in depth.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_00
 It's 15 minutes on a variety of different topics.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_00
 So it's just, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sure most of it I already know.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_00
 It's like, by safety, yeah.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_00
 Health safety, data protection, usual sort of stuff you get everywhere.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_00
 So university will cover itself legally.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_03
 I think we're doing this.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_02
 Well, if they were going to do that, then they'd push it to go to it.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_02
 I would, and I wouldn't know somebody who'd gone to know.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_02
 Nobody's pulled a super far.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_02
 I'm pretty sure they didn't have induction in my day.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I don't remember being asked for an induction.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_03
 Really?

0:31:27	SPEAKER_02
 But you only started here in April.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_02
 There was supposed to, I'm sure.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not going to.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_03
 I got invited to a, a summer garden party for new staff members.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_03
 But that was, that's all.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, well.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_00
 Then when I come here, when I started being a student, I mean, we had the induction of compulsory because, a lot of students were doing teaching, and you couldn't do the teaching unless you'd done the induction because you had to know about health and safety and fire safety before you could take a charge of, yeah, because you're a responsible person in the classroom.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_00
 So.

0:32:03	None
 Yep.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I'm not sure why I don't want to do it now.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see how I go.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_00
 I'll give you a report on Friday or something.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_03
 I have one NXT question.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's not one is hopefully as part of the output, it'll be something like that.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_03
 Is that correct?

0:32:27	SPEAKER_03
 So you've got the gase position of the first person, gase position of the second, the most position of the first, the most position of the second, and I don't know how common most action or something.

0:32:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_03
 That just in, in sort of.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_02
 Seems you're using what.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_02
 So it'll be like in the monitor.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah, there will be different tiers like that.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_02
 And then there's the language stuff as well.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_03
 That's just the.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, this is the easy stuff.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I was in my eyes and mice.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_02
 And that's enough for you.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, that's just the way you want to hopefully that's the.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_02
 Lots of things that can do that.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_03
 So I was just, yeah, I was just checking that I know the language part was a selfie or this would be the.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's the new part.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_02
 That seems fine.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_02
 Do you know what the sets of codes are?

0:33:26	SPEAKER_02
 Well, they would have whatever, whatever you're getting out of the jazz analyzer.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, whatever that is.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, blinks as well, right?

0:33:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, I'm not sure we need to know exactly where they are, just how many there are.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, so you don't want to part of the.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_03
 I suppose it could go.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_02
 I think you should.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_02
 Well, there's two views on this.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_02
 If you do, then the people formulating research questions will ask about them.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_02
 But if you don't, they'll probably ask about them anyway, and then you'll have to add them out to the fact.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I'm just going to add them.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I'm just going to add them out to the fact that they're not going to be able to.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_02
 So, you're just just just just chub them in.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_02
 You can stick them in a different track.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_02
 And then load them or not load them as you please.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_02
 Because it's not well, I don't know.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_02
 Is it is it part of.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_03
 So these are mutually exclusive and exhaustive sets of codes against time, right?

0:34:27	SPEAKER_03
 Isn't blink a part of this?

0:34:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but isn't that important because when they're blinking, basically, it's like a nil code.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_02
 You can't find out what they're doing otherwise.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_02
 So it may actually be important to have the blinks registered in there because you may discover you need to take them into account to smooth some kind of analysis that you do.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_02
 So it could be that if only they hadn't had a blink just then they would have been, I don't know what.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, moving somewhere else or it's more likely to be blinking at the same time as the other person is doing something.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_03
 But you want to know that.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_02
 Not too much relies on missing stuff because people blink.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_02
 I was thinking more like, you know, the person looks at a part and they've got a fixation before and after and the blink in the middle.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_02
 And, you know, there may be times when you want to treat that as one thing.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, normally we just add the blink time and duration to the previous fixation.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, right.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_02
 So, but in that case.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_03
 Because you're not absorbing any new information.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_03
 That's critical sort of deciding factories.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_02
 In that case, then these tiers are already like blink corrected.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, then you wouldn't have blinks as part of this.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_02
 You'd want blinks as a separate tier if you're going to have it.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_03
 It would be as a separate tier where just the mark.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, so the key thing is here is mutually exclusive and exhaustive.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_02
 And the second key thing is it better be really clear to the people who are dealing with these codes.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, whether any monkey business has been done around the books to correct for that.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_02
 Because no, it wouldn't necessarily be obvious looking at that set of codes.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, certainly not looking codes.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I suppose if you know that I track is then you'll just know.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_03
 I know what to look for and what not to.

0:36:39	SPEAKER_00
 So that means you need the blink corrections part of the analysis then.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_02
 I think you're saying it comes out of the eye tracker already, right?

0:36:46	SPEAKER_02
 They're already blink corrected.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_03
 Well, they're already the identified as blinks.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_03
 Then it's a.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_03
 It is at what stage the software.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_03
 The I've used pools and the blinks.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_03
 So we'll add it on.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_00
 So that's the stuff that comes with the eye tracker.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_03
 The end of the software comes with the eye tracker.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so certainly it's listed as a separate event in the stream.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_03
 Blinks are a tag from the EDF and that's everything.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_03
 It's registered as a.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if you want to bring some major interfixation in what we're making, making that out of part of the requirement for the GDF stuff.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_00
 So to remind me, just to add that analysis to it.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_00
 So it's not easy enough to be just checking the time.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:36	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, it won't because of the fixation.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_03
 It'll be down to what we define as a gaze.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_03
 So basically the time from when somebody starts looking at an object until they leave it.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_03
 And so if it blinks a lot within that, they're still looking at that object.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_03
 So it's just the time in to the timeout.

0:37:53	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:37:55	SPEAKER_02
 But what we need to know is like at what stage in the I track and software, whether that gets through so that Craig gets it automatically in what he's translating or to GDF, whether he needs to redo the same analysis because something about the data path cuts off that analysis for the I tracker.

0:38:11	SPEAKER_02
 Or whether we even like it, right?

0:38:13	SPEAKER_02
 I want to do it some different way.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_00
 I think the ASCII format as it stands does contain blink information.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_00
 Because I'm sure that's appeared in the documentation I've read through.

0:38:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:38:25	SPEAKER_02
 But it could be these things are corrected for blinks in this way.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_02
 Plus there's blink information.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_02
 So possibly.

0:38:33	SPEAKER_02
 You know, it's a fixation around blinks and it also just happens to tell you where the blinks are.

0:38:37	SPEAKER_02
 Because as I'm saying, they like to use blink rate as measures of cognitive difficulty or something.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:38:46	SPEAKER_00
 So my weather's a look at that and just just seeing what date is what is already in the essay format and whether you want me to do any correction as part of the analysis.

0:38:54	SPEAKER_00
 Because I've got to do an analysis for the fixations on parts and things anyway.

0:38:58	SPEAKER_00
 So yeah, I don't think check the blinks during that.

0:39:01	SPEAKER_00
 It's not going to be a, it shouldn't be a big problem.

0:39:04	SPEAKER_03
 It should just be a master of treating it.

0:39:06	SPEAKER_03
 I think on the blinks of the last fixation or something.

0:39:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:39:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:39:11	SPEAKER_01
 So.

0:39:12	SPEAKER_02
 It's enough still fixating on it when they come back out of the blink.

0:39:17	SPEAKER_02
 Then why is that the right thing we do analytically?

0:39:22	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the real reason is as long as they've been blinking even if they're in open eye somewhere else, that's when they start absorbing the information.

0:39:31	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, right.

0:39:32	None
 Yeah.

0:39:32	SPEAKER_02
 You said that.

0:39:33	SPEAKER_03
 It's basically like it's just a long saccade kind of a visual suppression when you move and it's the scene when you're blinking.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_03
 You're not taking anything in.

0:39:44	SPEAKER_02
 Well, but does the duration of fixations count for anything?

0:39:47	SPEAKER_02
 Because if you're just adding the blink to the fixation, you're not treating it as a saccade.

0:39:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:52	SPEAKER_03
 It's that yes, that's for this sort of geese time measure.

0:39:56	SPEAKER_03
 It's not actually the fixations are still independent.

0:40:00	SPEAKER_03
 So the fixation duration isn't doesn't include the blink in the ASCII output.

0:40:06	SPEAKER_03
 It's only when we start looking at sort of the total geese, the total amount of time spent looking at one particular object, which includes all these sort of multiple fixations and any blinks and that sort of thing.

0:40:17	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:40:18	SPEAKER_03
 So it's a composite viewing time.

0:40:22	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:40:23	SPEAKER_02
 So more complicated than I thought.

0:40:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:40:27	SPEAKER_02
 I forgot about the multiple fixations on an object.

0:40:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:40:30	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:40:31	SPEAKER_00
 So is there you're looking for a final thing which just says between this time and this time you're looking at this object between this time is time you're not looking at anything.

0:40:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. Although we'll also still need to account of the fixations just so we can you've got a measure of the average fixation duration again just see if it's been longer just.

0:40:50	SPEAKER_03
 More stable move.

0:40:51	SPEAKER_03
 I fixation or not.

0:40:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:40:54	None
 Yeah.

0:40:54	SPEAKER_00
 I think at the moment the GDF format has fixations in it.

0:40:57	SPEAKER_00
 And so I guess that would be part of the GDF to NXT transformation be to fixation to gase and whatever else.

0:41:05	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:41:06	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, this is kind of what we were talking about before this confusion about what's in the GDF.

0:41:12	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, you might see it as the initial GDF is just whatever straightforwardly translates without.

0:41:18	SPEAKER_02
 You know, without transforms with just the data format changing from the ASCII and then there's a bunch of other things that get added that you might still want to be in augmented GDF format.

0:41:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, like this blink and the gaze and whatever else and then you translate to NXT.

0:41:37	SPEAKER_02
 You might still want to have everything in this one GDF file format that represents everything and the NXT thing is just a splitter.

0:41:43	SPEAKER_02
 It's not doing any fancy analysis.

0:41:45	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:41:46	SPEAKER_02
 So I see this is, you know, a bunch of little routines that take the GDF without this information in it and add new information into subsequent versions of the GDF file that contains these post process analysis.

0:41:59	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that's partly why I brought this up now is I'm not sure at what point down the data path things sort of happened, but that's what I want to do in the end.

0:42:09	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:42:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:42:11	SPEAKER_00
 So, so, so we actually be doing much of the GDF or that are you expecting the most analysis on the NXT stuff and so when you're when you're actually during your results.

0:42:21	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the NXT stuff will have the more complete picture because it will include combine all the linguistic stuff with all the movements and the actions.

0:42:34	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:42:35	SPEAKER_03
 But there'll be a supposed just some purely I movement stuff we could do.

0:42:42	SPEAKER_03
 Presumably.

0:42:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:42:44	SPEAKER_00
 Well, yeah, you're talking about earlier because you could do a quick and you do quick analysis on the GDF stuff without having to before you hit before you do the dialogue.

0:42:51	SPEAKER_00
 This type of stuff so you can get some some results anyway.

0:42:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:42:54	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, it doesn't matter which data format it's in NXT or GDF, but it makes more sense for the converter between GDF and NXT not to add any data.

0:43:04	SPEAKER_02
 All it does is do this this stupid data format conversion.

0:43:08	SPEAKER_02
 And it's just, you know, suffering it out into little steps. So, you know, there have to be these other scripts that add any data transforms that data format trans, but data transforms like this idea of putting together gazes from fixations.

0:43:25	SPEAKER_02
 So, you know, if we keep it simple like that so that it's in little pieces, then it'll be just easier to understand what the whole thing does.

0:43:35	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:43:36	SPEAKER_02
 Because, you know, assembly you discover there's a problem with the GDF to NXT transform. You want to know whether it's one of these little post processes going wrong or whether it's just the thing that dumps it into the multiple files for the.

0:43:47	SPEAKER_02
 And GDF to NXT transform is pretty simple. So.

0:43:51	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:43:52	SPEAKER_03
 And that's also why I sent you the subrooking software.

0:43:57	SPEAKER_03
 That's a stuff that takes the ASCII format originally and then just.

0:44:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the German stuff.

0:44:06	SPEAKER_03
 Because that little utility does things like.

0:44:10	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you can tell it to put to do with links, but they're just a lump.

0:44:14	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:44:15	SPEAKER_03
 Or not put the minimum fixation duration per stable fixation would be.

0:44:20	SPEAKER_03
 So you have if it picks up fixations less than say 50 milliseconds, you can tell it just to again lump them all together.

0:44:27	SPEAKER_03
 That's not reliable enough fixation.

0:44:31	SPEAKER_03
 You can put in these sort of things. So that's a.

0:44:35	SPEAKER_03
 That's a bit of software saint and that includes the subrooking things as well.

0:44:39	SPEAKER_00
 So I'll take a relatively well without source code and I'm not restrictions on that.

0:44:44	SPEAKER_02
 So that's like all the analysis that you need to do to things and you're just going to copy what they do or.

0:44:50	SPEAKER_02
 Is it documented like why they did it the way they did it or is it just.

0:44:54	SPEAKER_03
 No, there's very little documentation is like.

0:45:00	SPEAKER_03
 What's good starting point, right?

0:45:02	SPEAKER_02
 So it'd be interesting to see if you agree with the decisions they made about how to do things.

0:45:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I suppose I can easily look through it and start writing some documentation on it and then.

0:45:11	SPEAKER_00
 I'll get that goes to a slight point for us to talk about today for what analysis we need to do on it and.

0:45:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, easy. Yeah, great.

0:45:19	SPEAKER_00
 All the switches and whatever else you need to do.

0:45:23	SPEAKER_03
 Good.

0:45:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so one to one. Yeah, well, once I've had a bit more look at the studio stuff and start looking through that.

0:45:33	SPEAKER_00
 Make sure that works.

0:45:35	SPEAKER_03
 It also just filters that there are a lot of.

0:45:38	SPEAKER_03
 And stranger big tags that the island produces.

0:45:43	SPEAKER_03
 I'm fairly meaningless.

0:45:45	SPEAKER_03
 And it strips a lot of the junk.

0:45:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, no, no, no, the jazz analyzing those quite a few things as well.

0:45:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, well, we don't want to build it into our data path.

0:45:57	SPEAKER_02
 We just want to learn from it, I think, right?

0:45:59	SPEAKER_02
 Correct?

0:46:00	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:46:01	SPEAKER_03
 Possibly.

0:46:02	SPEAKER_00
 What is the use of the use for generating the studio stuff?

0:46:06	SPEAKER_00
 I can easily incorporate whatever functions it takes from into just an analyzer when I'm doing the GDF.

0:46:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I'm just thinking, you know, lucky.

0:46:14	SPEAKER_02
 So this takes the asking to simplify the ASCII and simplify it in with transforms in it ASCII.

0:46:21	SPEAKER_02
 And it's just, it seems to me harder to maintain something that's got that in it.

0:46:26	SPEAKER_02
 It'd be better to break things up into like steps.

0:46:30	SPEAKER_02
 You know, as part of the, and also, well, why do I think this?

0:46:36	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know, because if somebody else is programming, they're going to give us the next version, and that's going to break our entire pipeline.

0:46:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, see what you mean.

0:46:42	SPEAKER_02
 That's the main reason.

0:46:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, but what, yeah, what's that?

0:46:46	SPEAKER_00
 What, what, what are the plans you do with it then?

0:46:49	SPEAKER_00
 It's take the, it's take the software, find out what functions are useful for us in that, and then use those functions to generate the stuff that goes into the XML file.

0:46:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I can imagine that also requiring some discussion about whether what they do is what we actually want to do.

0:47:03	SPEAKER_02
 That should be interesting.

0:47:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:47:05	SPEAKER_00
 But the first part of that will be documenting what they've got and then discussing it with Robin.

0:47:09	SPEAKER_00
 So.

0:47:10	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that's basically quite specific.

0:47:12	SPEAKER_03
 It's not going to be quite grab-a-pull because it is, it's written in Java.

0:47:16	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:47:17	SPEAKER_00
 But yeah, well, I'll throw it on my, I'm sure I'm sure most logic's going to be.

0:47:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, well, yeah, sure.

0:47:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, sure.

0:47:24	SPEAKER_00
 And.

0:47:25	SPEAKER_02
 And if in doubt, don't filter stuff out, keep it in, right?

0:47:28	SPEAKER_02
 Because we always dump it to this other NXT track that we don't need to load necessarily.

0:47:33	SPEAKER_02
 So.

0:47:34	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:47:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, better.

0:47:36	SPEAKER_02
 You just keep stuff on us.

0:47:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:47:39	SPEAKER_03
 It's always better than making too much compression to start with and then being able to go back.

0:47:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so.

0:47:47	SPEAKER_00
 So, as soon as XML, NXT will handle it, will it?

0:47:50	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:47:51	SPEAKER_02
 And it's easy enough to dump stuff into a separate track.

0:47:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yep.

0:47:54	SPEAKER_02
 We got to teach you about this at some point though.

0:47:56	SPEAKER_02
 So.

0:47:57	SPEAKER_02
 It's still not quite your one.

0:47:58	SPEAKER_02
 It sounds like maybe in another week.

0:48:01	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:48:02	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:48:03	SPEAKER_02
 Jonathan made me promise not to tell you about it when you first arrived.

0:48:06	SPEAKER_02
 I'm trying to get overload about learning.

0:48:08	SPEAKER_02
 But are you leaving very quickly?

0:48:10	SPEAKER_02
 It's just too many things at once and it wasn't important that it be then.

0:48:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:48:15	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I've got to hang you all the stuff I've been going through and it looks like it looks like I can come to the end of the stuff that's listed there already.

0:48:22	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm going to start looking at that as the next stage.

0:48:24	SPEAKER_02
 He's a cool customer.

0:48:25	SPEAKER_02
 He's ready for it.

0:48:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:48:29	SPEAKER_02
 I think we're done, right?

0:48:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:48:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:48:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:48:34	SPEAKER_03
 My peaches blank still.

0:48:42	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:48:44	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:48:45	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:48:46	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't really need to.

0:48:47	SPEAKER_02
 This just says look at the wiki.

0:48:50	SPEAKER_02
 Find out what's next.

0:48:51	SPEAKER_02
 You could give Craig more work to do.

0:48:53	SPEAKER_02
 This one's fine.

0:48:55	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to be telling you maybe having to check out these batteries and things like that.

0:48:59	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

0:49:00	SPEAKER_00
 We'll take forever.

0:49:01	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we'll do with the trains as bad as today.

0:49:06	SPEAKER_00
 So

0:49:13	None
 leaves up. Oh, yeah.

0:49:25	None
 Oh, yeah.

0:49:28	None
 Oh, yeah.

0:49:38	None
 Oh, yeah.

0:49:41	None
 I would try 10 years ago.

0:49:47	None
 Right.

0:49:50	None
 Okay.

0:50:00	None
 Okay.

0:50:29	None
 Okay.

0:51:00	None
 Okay.

0:51:05	None
 Okay.

0:51:08	None
 Okay.

0:51:12	None
 Okay.

0:51:19	None
 Okay.

0:51:22	None
 Okay.
