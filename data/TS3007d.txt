0:00:00	None
 Mr. Big.

0:00:16	None
 You still have some minutes left, don't we?

0:00:18	None
 Yeah.

0:00:19	None
 Or a minute?

0:00:20	None
 Sorry.

0:00:21	None
 We still have some time left for the meeting.

0:00:24	None
 Yeah.

0:00:25	SPEAKER_03
 One minute.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_03
 Like a minute.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_04
 Do whatever you want.

0:00:29	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, what a lot of other.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:00:31	None
 Oh, maybe you can display it on the screen.

0:00:33	None
 I'm just doing this, sorry.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_02
 Nah, this is just about...

0:00:37	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_02
 I have some shok over here.

0:00:40	None
 It tastes funny.

0:00:41	None
 What if you don't?

0:00:44	SPEAKER_02
 It's like mixed chocolate milk and coffee or something.

0:00:49	None
 Oh, that's good.

0:00:51	None
 No, Steve.

0:00:52	None
 Picture's mixed after each other in the mouth.

0:00:55	None
 Shana pot.

0:00:56	None
 Yeah, that would be better.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe easier with open and...

0:01:00	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, see.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:01:02	None
 Did you put it in the chat for a while?

0:01:04	None
 Yeah.

0:01:05	None
 Oh, we can begin.

0:01:06	None
 We have to the meeting room and bring your letter.

0:01:09	None
 Thank you.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_02
 That's tight too.

0:01:18	None
 Welcome to the...

0:01:19	None
 Sorry.

0:01:20	None
 Yeah.

0:01:21	None
 Alright.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe good for a presentation if I just...

0:01:24	None
 Not sure if yet.

0:01:26	None
 Oh, I see.

0:01:28	None
 Okay.

0:01:29	None
 But welcome to the fourth meeting, the details design meeting, where we have to reach the session on the details of the remote control.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_03
 Presented by your...

0:01:39	SPEAKER_03
...pornomally...

0:01:40	SPEAKER_03
...protic manager.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_03
 What we're going to do?

0:01:45	SPEAKER_03
 Once again, I'm going to take minutes, so no presentation for me.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_03
 First, we have a prototype presentation by G and G.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_03
 After what some evaluation criteria...

0:02:00	SPEAKER_03
 Evaluation criteria.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_03
 Evaluation criteria.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_03
 In combination with finance, I received an Excel file, which we have to fill in later on.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_03
 You see?

0:02:22	SPEAKER_03
 And then we must see if we stay under the 12 and a half euro.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_03
 So that's...

0:02:30	SPEAKER_00
 That's a bit...

0:02:31	SPEAKER_03
 So let's...

0:02:32	SPEAKER_03
...proble.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_03
 We have...

0:02:34	SPEAKER_03
 We must have some time for that because it will be quite a lot of mathematics.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_03
 After that evaluation of the process, how we have done it here with the Smartboard, with our laptops, with all this.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_03
 And afterwards, we're closing.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_03
 Once again, 40 minutes.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_03
 Let's start.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_03
 I will give the word to G and G for the prototype.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_03
 Presentation.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_04
 Presentation.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_04
 And then...

0:03:06	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, well, sure.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_03
 J and J.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_02
 J and J.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_02
 J and J.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, guys.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_02
 Take it away.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_02
 Take it away.

0:03:16	None
 Tsk.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_04
 This was our first concept.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_04
 We decided to use a single touchscreen.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_04
 So we've worked out these concepts, how to hold it, where to put it, what's this and stuff.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_04
 And, well, we began with a form of shape that is easy to hold in one hand, left or right-handed.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_04
 So we made it a little bit less thick and have some artistic meaning.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yes, it's not that easy.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's better.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_04
 Well, during the meeting, I showed you the concept of placing the buttons on top, usable with your thumb, and the menu structure, if necessary, with your other hand.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_04
 So it's going to hold it easily, and it has to be accessible with your other hand too, of course.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_04
 So we began working our concepts.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well, as usual, we would just have to basically mode with the panel LCD screen.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_01
 Well, these would be the main buttons.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_01
 You could change them later on in your own profile if you want to, but, well, the standard will be delivered with this kind of setup, with the more advanced menu sitting right here, with the sub-menus and stuff.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_01
 We made a top or front view, just like you want a back view.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_01
 As you can see, this is two weird bumps in it.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_01
 This is for the added effect of our youth and dynamic, and this is for artistic effect.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_01
 Well, what we figured is, we'll show you a picture later on, you'll have a better idea after that, but the idea is to stay in balance with these two.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_01
 So when you put it on the table, it will just lay down, it won't roll around and stuff, but it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone, maybe, or like these old phones.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_01
 You may get the idea.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_01
 So this is about how we figured it should be.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_01
 You would hide with some more rubber layers, like we discussed earlier.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_01
 You wouldn't see a straight panel, but more fluidly and round.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_04
 The panel just, of course, goes like this.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_04
 But the overlaying layer is a little bit cursed and stuff.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. And in these bumps, you could actually put some electronics out of which you could make a more thinner design, and that would actually look very nice.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_01
 And about the colour.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah, that this can be held with your hands.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_04
 So this maximum is one and a half centimeters.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_04
 So you have room here for your battery, and maybe even other electronic chips.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_04
 So you can just be the layer of the touchscreen and some wires underneath it to make it as clean as possible in the middle for a good, great.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_01
 As cutters, do you have a picture in there?

0:06:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, this is the idea about the bumps.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_01
 You can see there's a very youthful dynamic exterior.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_01
 You just want to hold it if you were young and dynamic like us.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_02
 It's like an Easter egg.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's like, but this is for children, we want a more adult version, but this is like a remote control for children.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_01
 It's called a we-mode.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_01
 We-mode.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_01
 A we-mode, yeah.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_01
 It's actually brilliant. Mark Tingston.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_02
 Wait, what I got in mind.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_01
 So this is actually basically the idea.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_01
 We just want to build a more adult version of this.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I can imagine that.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_01
 And for colors, we figured starting with basic colors like white or metallic gray.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_01
 Those are the technological colors actually.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_04
 It would be best to appeal to a broad public and make the conference exchangeable, so the young people will buy an orange and a red and a blue one.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_04
 Sure, but when older people go in the shop and see an orange remote control, it would be less appealing than a white one.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_04
 And young people we think are a little bit more flexible.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_04
 I'll buy for a couple of euros.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_04
 It's a nice hit.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_02
 So that you can pick a cover in the shop.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_04
 I think a cover is necessary because I'll just have the LCD screen.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_04
 There must be some cheap standard cover, maybe white or something that comes with it and you can buy it so we can make it.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but you mustn't forget that our target aim is younger people.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_03
 We had decided to put some flashy fruit-free colors in it.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_03
 And in the surfy from Milan and Paris, it came out that the older people are more willing to spend money on extra futures.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_03
 So I think it will be a better idea to have some flashy-free colors as standard for the people who really want a more sophisticated, more traditional look.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_03
 They are willing to pay that.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_03
 They want more luxury stuff, but they have the money to do it and they want to buy that.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_01
 That's a standard.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, perhaps, all right.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_01
 I would agree with this sound logical.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_02
 Another idea.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we could develop a cover with wood style.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_02
 They would please the elder users as well.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_04
 Well, yeah, a color of wood style, a white and a couple of pretty colors.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_04
 And the leverage standard with a pretty color but not too much.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_04
 Banana and mango, not purple or orange.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_03
 But I think the standard must be some kind of attractive, flashy color.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_03
 Not too button, a little.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, like this.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_01
 This isn't too much, is it?

0:09:52	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the buttons.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_02
 It could be a standard model.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, something like this would be nice.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, that's for most.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, it's my time now.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_03
 The marketing expert.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_02
 During the design lifecycle, we made a lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_02
 Now is the time to evaluate our prototype concept to the past requirements.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_02
 So we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_02
 We're going to do that with a seven point scale.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_02
 Opening a word document now.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_02
 One.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_02
 I have to explain something.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_02
 We have to be consensus about things.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_02
 So it has to be a group decision.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_03
 So we're going to evaluate the.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the thing we need.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. One.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_02
 The remote controls designed for people with age below 40.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_03
 Seven.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_03
 Seven is fourth.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_01
 True.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_01
 One.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, one.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_01
 I think most true.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's not just designed for people under the age of 40.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_01
 It's also designed for people above 40.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's not just the question is aimed at design for people with age below 40.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_01
 But it's also designed for people above 40.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_01
 Exactly.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_01
 Also, it's about three.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it will be primarily appealing to minus 40.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_02
 Also, yeah.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_02
 The second.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_02
 The remote controls.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_02
 Beautiful.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_02
 Wow.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_02
 According to us, it's one.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_02
 It's the marketing.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_04
 We have a one.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_02
 Of course, you have to be very positive and enthusiastic about your own problem.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_02
 That's also three.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control looks fancy.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_02
 One.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_02
 Perfect.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_02
 Good.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_02
 For the remote control, it's big, clear, channel switching buttons.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_01
 These two user faces.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_04
 User interface experts.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_02
 Data text buttons and volume buttons.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_02
 No, data text.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_03
 But data text is in the menu.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_01
 False?

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 False.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_02
 And volume.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_02
 Volume is true.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_02
 Big and clear.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_01
 Big and clear.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_04
 Big and clear.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_04
 But you could make a teletext button six.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_04
 Otherwise people would read this.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to think we have no teletext button.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_01
 It's not in your show.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_01
 It isn't entirely unclear.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 So I wouldn't give it a seven.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_01
 I would give it a five or a six.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_01
 Five?

0:13:45	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_03
 It's a project.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I agree.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_03
 I was thinking very black and white.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_04
 Looking at it.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you, Jenny.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_03
 Brad.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_02
 I forget to say to volume.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control is easy to be found.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we put fancy colors here.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_01
 And it has all these fruity colors and it has a strange shape.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_01
 So if you have trouble finding it.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_04
 It's not making any sounds.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_02
 So, look.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_02
 If you put your normal remote control under your bed, or you throw the S remote control under your bed, it's a better finding.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_04
 It will make a difference.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_04
 We have the better remote.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_04
 I think so.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_04
 My remote control is black.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_04
 A little bit maybe.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_02
 A little bit.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_03
 We can do it glow in the dark.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_03
 So even the dark place you feel.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_02
 I think five.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't really make a lot of.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_01
 Well, then I'll go for four.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_01
 Four?

0:14:54	SPEAKER_01
 Because four is between three and between two.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, you're right.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_03
 I think five is between four and six.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_03
 According to the other remote controls, there may be there in your TV room.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_03
 There's one we'll stand out.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's a better question.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's one more spot.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_03
 If this line on your couch, you think, what's that for?

0:15:22	SPEAKER_02
 Sure, sure.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_02
 The survey under users was that they really lost it.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_04
 They're stupid.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_02
 Like not seeing it, but lost it in the house or something.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_01
 If you see a strange shape line somewhere, then you'd recognize it as, whoa, that's strange.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_04
 That's a remote control.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_02
 What is that?

0:15:47	SPEAKER_02
 I agree, I agree.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, most of the time, you lose it your shirt.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_04
 So your remote controls are fresh through the collar.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_04
 I would call it a choose two because we decided not to make two fresh collars.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_02
 Not too fresh.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_02
 The remote controls are made of soft material.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, rubber is kind of soft.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but not too soft.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_01
 Not too soft.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_03
 Three?

0:16:07	SPEAKER_03
 Three.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, easy to use.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_03
 Easy to use?

0:16:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, can it be zero?

0:16:14	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I don't, yeah, it's just kind of easy to use.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_02
 It's not the most easy to use.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_04
 No, it can do two because...

0:16:21	SPEAKER_04
 It can be easier.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_04
 It can be easier.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_04
 Just with ten buttons.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but then you'll lose our functionality.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, functionality and our fancy look.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but the most easy to use.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_02
 It's just with one button.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_04
 The other easy to use because you have primary buttons always.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay, but not the most easy to use.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_01
 No, actually, I'll go for two.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_01
 My vote's on two.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, mine too.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_02
 We also have to compare it to the remote controls on the market nowadays.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, wait, it's just a minute.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_04
 Inspiration.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_03
 What's the time we also have to do the evaluation and the production.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_02
 Regular remote stuff.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I'm hurrying.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, eleven.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_02
 The remote controls and all of this.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, yes.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_04
 Two, one.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_04
 You agree, Tim?

0:17:13	SPEAKER_03
 Of course.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_03
 You have to see the more innovative thing in there.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_02
 The remote controls, remove both of them.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, one.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_04
 Very multifunctional.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_02
 It has speech recognition.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_04
 This is used with speech recognition.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control has building games.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_04
 But maybe make it too because the games are in a sub-menu and not, it's not the one.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but they are built in.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_04
 So it's one.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, no, I'll build in.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_02
 The lost.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_01
 But, I thought it was going to be a bit less.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_01
 You really like the parental advice.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_04
 Did you make this or the safe house?

0:18:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, he made it.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_04
 He changed it, man.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_02
 The moss.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, dear.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_03
 How is your turn?

0:18:17	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:18	None
 Thank you.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_00
 Hmm.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_03
 We have now to calculate the production cost.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_03
 If it's under 12 and a half euro, then it's a.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_03
 But it is, if it is, but no, this is right.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_03
 Redesign.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_03
 If you're under 50.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:19:15	None
 Yeah.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_03
 It's a car.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_03
 It's under 12 and a half euro.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_03
 Then we can move on to the project evaluation as we have experienced it.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_03
 Otherwise we have to do a little redesign thingy.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_03
 So we have to fill in the numbers of the components.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_03
 We have to want to do it in and see if we stay under the 12 and a half euro.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_03
 So do we have a hand dynamic?

0:19:50	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_03
 That's zero.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_03
 Battery.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_03
 One.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_03
 Simple chip on print?

0:20:08	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_03
 Simple sensor.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_03
 Simple speaker.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_02
 It's fast chip.

0:20:14	None
 It's three.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_02
 Three.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_02
 One.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_02
 One.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_02
 One piece.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_03
 Three euro.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_01
 What's a sample sensor?

0:20:23	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's speech recognition.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's speech recognition.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_03
 One.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_03
 Zero.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_03
 Uncurfed flat.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_03
 Zero.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_03
 But it's not made from a single uncurfed thingy and then...

0:20:37	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_03
 Thingy.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_03
 And then...

0:20:40	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_03
 So it's only once double curved.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_04
 Because the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the...

0:20:50	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_03
 We're now in a problem.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_03
 Because we have...

0:20:54	SPEAKER_03
 We have 11 euro.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_04
 We don't have anything else.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_01
 We'll see how much we are over budget.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_04
 You step a little to the wrong.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_03
 Two.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_03
 Rubber.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_03
 You don't...

0:21:12	SPEAKER_03
 Ditani, I'm no.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_04
 Special.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_04
 It's the special color.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think so.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_01
 It's a standard color.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_01
 This is a special color.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_03
 We want to make the wood color.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_03
 So that's...

0:21:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_04
 If you're honest with you all the time, you have a special color.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_02
 That's an adult.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_02
 That's another brand.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_02
 That's another article.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_02
 The cell.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_03
 But we're going to...

0:21:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_03
 That's true.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_03
 But yeah.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't account for this.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we'll finish this.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_03
 And then look back.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_04
 Scoville.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_03
 One.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_03
 One.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have...

0:22:00	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_01
 We're only four of our budget.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_03
 So, what's the thing we can change?

0:22:06	SPEAKER_01
 Well, are there a case?

0:22:07	SPEAKER_01
 We can make it single-curved or uncurved.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_00
 Can I...

0:22:11	SPEAKER_00
 I say something?

0:22:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_00
 Of course.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_03
 Can I say something?

0:22:15	SPEAKER_03
 Asparatic management.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_03
 Just...

0:22:17	SPEAKER_03
 The kinetic thing.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_03
 Can we just skip it?

0:22:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_03
 You have to shake it, but that's not really enough.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_04
 We just put it in battery and it's mobile phone nowadays.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_02
 Daniel.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_02
 Daniel.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_02
 Daniel.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_02
 What do you think about putting a battery in it?

0:22:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_02
 But also selling like the coffee or a docking station.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_02
 Just apart from the thing.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_02
 And then you can put rechargeable batteries in it.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_04
 Just...

0:22:49	SPEAKER_04
 What you can use rechargeable batteries anyway.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_04
 Just...

0:22:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_03
 Not really enough.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_03
 But we...

0:22:56	SPEAKER_03
 You forget about the kinetic.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_03
 Sure.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_03
 Well, if we do that...

0:23:00	SPEAKER_03
 Which are you?

0:23:01	SPEAKER_01
 Thirteen to health.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you can go from double-curved to single-curved.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_01
 Of course.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_01
 And that would solve the budget problem.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_01
 So we have to break the...

0:23:08	SPEAKER_03
 But the single-curved is just...

0:23:11	SPEAKER_03
 It's just...

0:23:12	SPEAKER_03
 Oh.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_04
 Well, the single-curved...

0:23:15	SPEAKER_04
 One-curved and not the back-curved I think.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_03
 Exactly.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_03
 That's one option.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_03
 And then, yeah.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_03
 Then we could have it.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's...

0:23:27	SPEAKER_03
 It's a main point of the...

0:23:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_03
 But we'll look.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_04
 Then we have to cut out.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_04
 We don't fall.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_04
 It's a little bit of problem.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, no.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_03
 That can be done.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:23:38	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, though, can we make it with the back- Okay.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_03
 A little less...

0:23:41	SPEAKER_03
 Conversation.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_03
 Hey.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_02
 Those are...

0:23:44	SPEAKER_02
 Art.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_02
 Art.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_02
 What are they for?

0:23:47	SPEAKER_02
 Some...

0:23:48	SPEAKER_02
 Blue...

0:23:49	SPEAKER_03
 Blue...

0:23:50	SPEAKER_03
 Fill in the mirror.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_03
 Just...

0:23:52	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_03
 Explanation.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_02
 So 50?

0:23:55	SPEAKER_03
 I can delete it for you if you want.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, no.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_03
 So if we do this, we are on 12.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_03
 And a half euro.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_03
 And we're done?

0:24:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_04
 But does it fit with our design?

0:24:06	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe actually...

0:24:07	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the only thing that don't...

0:24:10	SPEAKER_03
 The single curve.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, single curve.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_03
 But there's a curve in it.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:24:14	SPEAKER_04
 We just make the bubbles cut off the back and then...

0:24:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we just make it flat.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_01
 But you do look...

0:24:21	SPEAKER_02
 Look, what is the...

0:24:24	SPEAKER_02
 If you make it double curve.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_02
 It costs one euro more.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_02
 You make it optional.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_02
 No, but...

0:24:33	SPEAKER_02
 Does it have a lot of extra...

0:24:36	SPEAKER_02
 Function?

0:24:37	SPEAKER_01
 Actually...

0:24:38	SPEAKER_02
 Function more.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_02
 What does it have added with?

0:24:40	SPEAKER_02
 A static value, but not function.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's really a static value.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_02
 A static.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, you make like 11 and a half euros a profit.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_02
 Instead of 12 and a half, but...

0:24:55	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if 12 and a half is a fixed price.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_02
 Now, well, that's a true price.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_01
 We should assume that it is.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_01
 I think the kinetic would be a marketing promotion.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_01
 If you promote kinetic...

0:25:14	SPEAKER_01
 I...

0:25:15	SPEAKER_01
 Kinetic remote control.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, that would sell better than a normal remote control.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_03
 Do you think?

0:25:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_03
 Well, now you can shake your remote control.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_01
 No, well, I mean, you can count to your neighbor and tell them, Ha!

0:25:27	SPEAKER_01
 My remote control is kinetic.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_01
 You have standard old battery control remote control.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_02
 What about all the environments freaks?

0:25:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but it does fit in a cost profile.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's...

0:25:42	SPEAKER_04
 It's a good light there, as well.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_04
 You can make it in a specialized extra gold version.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_03
 Because if you want to go to kinetic, you're on turning a half and you must go to flat.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_03
 And I think now it's more of a compromise.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_03
 And if you make the single curve, just a big curve, then it's a...

0:26:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, one big...

0:26:07	SPEAKER_00
 One big...

0:26:09	SPEAKER_03
 Good curve.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_03
 I was coming to a...

0:26:13	SPEAKER_03
 Say nasty words, but I don't see.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_03
 This is strange, by the way.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_03
 Wood is cheaper than rubber.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_03
 We thought that wood would be more expensive.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_03
 It's American figures.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_04
 You just cut down some trees.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, maybe.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_03
 But this is it?

0:26:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, this is it.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, this is it.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to save it.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to save it.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_04
 Titanium.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_01
 It is possible.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_01
 But you can't use double curves for titanium.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_01
 That's one of the functional biddity.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_03
 Well, considering we have...

0:26:49	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, no.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_02
 I have to do all those hours again.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_02
 One back.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_02
 Gas on.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_02
 No, for redesign.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we were above.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we did a little redesign.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's that rule.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_03
 Now, it's about time to talk about this project.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_03
 Some things.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_03
 Was there room for creativity?

0:27:21	SPEAKER_03
 In our meetings, or in your individual meetings?

0:27:24	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't think so.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_02
 There was a lot of room for it.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_02
 But that's mainly because of the information that was delivered to us.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_02
 It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_02
 And I couldn't go on the internet and share my own stuff.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_03
 That's true.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_03
 I agree with that.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think you too.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_01
 Especially you and the...

0:27:52	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know, you both had the less creative roles in the project.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_03
 That's true.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_04
 For us, I think...

0:27:59	SPEAKER_04
 Also, I think we could just sign up and remove it if you like.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_01
 I think you're run and I.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_01
 We had more design.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_01
 We could have more...

0:28:10	SPEAKER_01
 We had more room for creativity than you too.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's true.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_03
 How about leadership?

0:28:18	SPEAKER_03
 Leadership was crappy.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_02
 The leadership wasn't crappy.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_01
 It was the leader that was crappy.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_01
 Leadership was okay.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_01
 We're done.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_04
 Example of crappy leadership.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_02
 I thought the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_02
 You could have...

0:28:42	SPEAKER_02
 But it was your first?

0:28:44	SPEAKER_02
 No disrespect or something.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_02
 But you could have structured a little bit more.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_02
 So, like, I was talking most of the time, the first meeting.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_02
 You could say shut up.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_03
 But I know the city too.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_03
 I was also very unhappy, very unsatisfied about...

0:29:02	SPEAKER_03
 About me.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_03
 About the first meeting.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_03
 So, I hope...

0:29:07	SPEAKER_03
 That's a little fun on the stage.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_01
 And we will never do it again.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_03
 Get better.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_03
 And I think the last two meetings also, we reached some good decision.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_03
 More consensus.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_04
 Everybody was really...

0:29:22	SPEAKER_03
 Much more constructive.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_03
 So, that's cool.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_03
 Teamwork?

0:29:26	SPEAKER_03
 Well, maybe that's only...

0:29:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, it's for us.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we worked together on the project, but everybody has his own tasks.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_03
 And it's more like presentation.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_03
 And some points were discussed.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_03
 Really teamwork where you two...

0:29:40	SPEAKER_03
 So, I just went to crazy.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it went well.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_01
 It's just...

0:29:44	SPEAKER_01
 It was hard to feel.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_01
 Stupid then, but...

0:29:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we had some trouble with the pen.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_03
 Now you must push a little while.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but it was something difficult.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_04
 Just write your name right now.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_04
 Try to write your name.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_04
 In writing letters, of course.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, normally...

0:30:08	SPEAKER_04
 This is a block letter sign there.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_04
 Just write your name in one line.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_04
 Just a little bit small, ankylric, quicker now.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_03
 You can be...

0:30:18	SPEAKER_03
 You can go quicker, because then it won't notice it.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, he knows how to work.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_03
 I followed him out to class for the smartboard.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's the main issue.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_03
 So, about this one you were...

0:30:35	SPEAKER_03
 You were dealing with?

0:30:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_03
 The digital pen?

0:30:40	SPEAKER_04
 The idea is great, but it works properly.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_02
 The digital pen, I thought, the first time I did individual work, I used it.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_02
 And the first two meetings, I brought it with me, but I didn't use it at all after the first meeting.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_02
 No, I haven't proven it.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_01
 You know, I was not real used.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_01
 No, I don't have that much added value to it.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_04
 As I said a few moments ago, I would like myself to write it with a normal pen, because it must...

0:31:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's almost the same concept, but you can just more simply put it on our scanner.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_04
 It's the same concept.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_04
 It must depend.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_04
 You have to download software, very slow.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_03
 And it is still your own handwriting, up and up.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't give any added value.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's really not.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_03
 And the smartboard is useful, but the pen is not user-friendly, I think.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, not user-friendly.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_03
 It takes a lot of time to draw things and write things.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_02
 It's not very precise.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_02
 We try to do this.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and try to write your name in a normal size.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_04
 Smaller.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_04
 Smaller?

0:31:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, smaller.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_04
 Just when you're writing on a letter.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but that's not...

0:32:01	SPEAKER_03
 When you send an added foreign audience, you don't gonna write...

0:32:05	SPEAKER_04
 As you saw on this drawing, it's open this one or that one.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we have more problems even here.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_04
 When we try to draw this button, it's almost impossible for clear roundings when you're...

0:32:21	SPEAKER_03
 Oh.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_03
 But maybe there's some function with...

0:32:24	SPEAKER_03
 No, it isn't.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_04
 And the eraser was not a problem.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_04
 It's this large.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, you try to erase this line.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I'm gonna erase my name.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_04
 I'm gonna erase my name.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's a big eraser.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, new ideas.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_04
 Erm, what kind of new ideas?

0:32:45	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the idea of the touch screen is...

0:32:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, two years.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_03
 Go on.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just...

0:32:54	SPEAKER_04
 New ideas about the working of this software, about the project, about remote controls.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what I mean.

0:33:04	None
 I don't know what I mean.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_03
 Did you heard what you said?

0:33:12	SPEAKER_03
 I don't...

0:33:13	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what I mean.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I have some figure.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_02
 Here.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_02
 The evaluation.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_02
 The mean number is 1.8, 1.86.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_02
 That's interesting.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_02
 So that's fairly good, I think.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_03
 Because what does it mean?

0:33:34	SPEAKER_02
 So true.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_02
 That...

0:33:36	SPEAKER_02
 All the requirements are between 1 and 2.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_03
 True or varied.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_03
 True.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, okay.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_03
 Expert.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_03
 But the new ideas found with working with this software?

0:33:53	SPEAKER_04
 Not really.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_04
 They have to improve.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_04
 The concept is okay.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_04
 But it has to be quicker.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_04
 It's still opening my program.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_04
 How much of my entire computer is locked up?

0:34:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_04
 It just takes too many time.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_04
 People will still feel the need to write it quickly on a page and not download it and save it.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_03
 You're expected to be more user friendly.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_04
 When you use a pen, you can just draw like you do normally.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe the idea you proposed is a screen here.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_02
 You can draw it and it's placed over there.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_04
 Or at least when you don't have to adapt to the technologies, you can write in a way you normally write.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_04
 Now you have to keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen and that's a very bad concept.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's true.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_02
 Very bad.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_04
 No, okay.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_02
 It's my opinion that this is better than regular flipovers.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it can be safety easier.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_04
 But if you're in normal flipover, a lot of people write text.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_04
 There's not a text option.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_04
 And writing text, you've got to really do your best.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_03
 And maybe some functions for a circle or a square.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_03
 You have to draw it yourself now.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe even insert picture if you have some presentation.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_01
 Or text function.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_01
 Just type text.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_01
 That would be excellent.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but insert image isn't available.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_02
 Because then you could picture from scanner clip-on.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_02
 That can be done already.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_03
 But not the hyperlink predefined squares.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_02
 What if you do like hyperlink?

0:35:54	SPEAKER_04
 It was www.google.com.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_02
 Real reaction.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_02
 That's okay.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_04
 You'll just make a link in.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_04
 Well, that's nice.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_04
 There's one way to double click it.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe if you're not using the eraser.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_02
 Erasing.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_02
 Something else.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_02
 Select.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_02
 Double click.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you have, as you saw, you have a little.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, thank you.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_03
 You can go.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:42	None
 There.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_03
 So there are the functionality is there.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_03
 It's not ideal.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_03
 It costs a lot of time to use.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_04
 To use.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_03
 And that's a pity.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_03
 If you have 30, 40 minutes.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_03
 For this kind of thing.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_03
 And we are now with four people.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_03
 Well, imagine you are here with ten people.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_03
 Everyone.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_04
 You're here with management.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_04
 You get two minutes to make your case.

0:37:12	SPEAKER_04
 Two minutes of drawing.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_04
 You better use power points and work it out in a font.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_04
 And one or two things you have to draw when you're there.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_02
 What I really miss also is a.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_02
 It's a decision system like.

0:37:34	SPEAKER_02
 You have to.

0:37:36	SPEAKER_02
 You have to.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_02
 Both like what do you want?

0:37:40	SPEAKER_02
 One or two?

0:37:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:42	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe a little application like.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_02
 Give your number and click one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:53	SPEAKER_03
 Just like you said with the screen which you can write.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_03
 Also kind of voting.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_02
 Voting application.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_02
 Just a little group.

0:38:01	SPEAKER_02
 Group decision application.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_01
 But the problem is you can't discuss anything.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you can.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_01
 You can.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_01
 But you will discuss a lot less than like we did now.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, one person maybe said free.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_01
 But we said no.

0:38:19	SPEAKER_01
 I think too because this and this and then you can react on it.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_01
 But if you put a free on it.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_01
 Just figure out everybody knows what I'm knowing.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_01
 So they all just put a two on.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, of course.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_02
 But you can still discuss about it.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:36	SPEAKER_02
 But click it in an application.

0:38:38	SPEAKER_02
 That's a lot easier to process.

0:38:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_01
 For process.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_01
 But then I think the idea of one person entering it and discussing it.

0:38:49	SPEAKER_01
 Isn't that bad idea actually.

0:38:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:38:53	SPEAKER_01
 Not that your opinion isn't value, but still.

0:38:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:38:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:38:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:39:00	SPEAKER_04
 So.

0:39:01	SPEAKER_04
 That's it.

0:39:02	SPEAKER_03
 Well, just about.

0:39:03	SPEAKER_04
 Because when are we going to produce it?

0:39:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:07	SPEAKER_03
 Tomorrow.

0:39:08	SPEAKER_03
 Celebrate.

0:39:09	SPEAKER_03
 Because we're within the budget.

0:39:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:12	SPEAKER_03
 The project is a fairly good.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_03
 But before we don't celebrate.

0:39:15	SPEAKER_03
 I have a little question which you can't answer because there must be some kind of entry port.

0:39:22	SPEAKER_03
 I'm busy with the entry port right now.

0:39:24	SPEAKER_03
 You might think what the hell is he doing?

0:39:26	SPEAKER_02
 What is an entry port?

0:39:28	SPEAKER_03
 About all the meetings, what we have decided.

0:39:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:32	SPEAKER_03
 A report of this day.

0:39:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:34	SPEAKER_03
 That must be made.

0:39:35	SPEAKER_03
 But I don't know.

0:39:36	SPEAKER_03
 Here is standing.

0:39:37	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we can celebrate now.

0:39:39	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:39:40	SPEAKER_02
 You have ten minutes left.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_02
 I read.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_02
 You have now ten minutes left to finish up the entry.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:39:46	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that can be done.

0:39:47	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we can do it together.

0:39:49	SPEAKER_03
 You can see when I've.

0:39:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:52	SPEAKER_03
 I will put it on a storyboard.

0:39:54	SPEAKER_03
 You can see it.

0:39:57	SPEAKER_03
 Because I think it will.

0:40:00	SPEAKER_03
 It must be.

0:40:01	SPEAKER_02
 You're all made better.

0:40:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:40:04	SPEAKER_03
 It's a three.

0:40:06	SPEAKER_03
 75 pages.

0:40:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:40:10	SPEAKER_03
 75 pages.

0:40:12	SPEAKER_03
 Well, just a moment.

0:40:15	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:40:16	SPEAKER_03
 Daniel.

0:40:18	SPEAKER_02
 You want a chair?

0:40:23	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe.

0:40:24	SPEAKER_02
 A chairman.

0:40:25	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no.

0:40:27	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just.

0:40:28	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, you can read it.

0:40:31	SPEAKER_03
 Here it is.

0:40:32	SPEAKER_03
 You finish it actually.

0:40:33	SPEAKER_01
 So we just have to read it.

0:40:35	SPEAKER_01
 And so yes or no?

0:40:37	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's not.

0:40:38	SPEAKER_03
 Read only.

0:40:39	SPEAKER_03
 But it's not.

0:40:40	SPEAKER_03
 It's not.

0:40:41	SPEAKER_02
 Five minutes.

0:40:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:40:43	SPEAKER_03
 For finishing.

0:40:44	SPEAKER_03
 This is about the functional design.

0:40:47	SPEAKER_03
 The management expert here.

0:40:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:40:49	SPEAKER_03
 Change that.

0:40:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:40:51	SPEAKER_03
 When I said it, I remember.

0:40:53	SPEAKER_02
 I said read only version.

0:40:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but you can save it under another name.

0:40:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:40:59	SPEAKER_03
 One thing actually.

0:41:00	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:41:03	SPEAKER_03
 About three functions which are most used and which must immediately be visible on our remote control.

0:41:11	SPEAKER_03
 It must be simple to use.

0:41:14	SPEAKER_03
 Very clear what to do and the younger people.

0:41:17	SPEAKER_03
 So this is really about what kind of things must be in it.

0:41:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:41:23	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:41:24	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe.

0:41:25	SPEAKER_02
 Oh.

0:41:26	None
 Yeah.

0:41:27	None
 Yeah.

0:41:28	SPEAKER_02
 I understand you.

0:41:31	SPEAKER_03
 I can talk a little bit.

0:41:33	SPEAKER_02
 You have to put switch channels at the top because that's the most function.

0:41:40	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:41:41	SPEAKER_02
 Data text at the second.

0:41:43	SPEAKER_03
 I really didn't.

0:41:45	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:41:46	SPEAKER_02
 Volume changing.

0:41:47	SPEAKER_03
 So this one switch.

0:41:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:41:50	SPEAKER_03
 You go there and you go.

0:41:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:41:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:41:55	SPEAKER_03
 Cool.

0:41:56	SPEAKER_03
 Well, maybe I can do it.

0:41:59	SPEAKER_03
 One, two, three.

0:42:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:42:01	SPEAKER_03
 I've got it.

0:42:02	SPEAKER_03
 Good.

0:42:03	SPEAKER_03
 If the order is in.

0:42:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:42:05	SPEAKER_03
 Important.

0:42:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:42:07	SPEAKER_03
 That's the word for the order.

0:42:10	SPEAKER_03
 Then the conceptual design.

0:42:13	SPEAKER_03
 Well, all the things we have discussed the energy.

0:42:17	SPEAKER_03
 Which turn out to be a battery.

0:42:20	SPEAKER_03
 So that's working.

0:42:21	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe you can add it later.

0:42:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:42:24	SPEAKER_03
 We decided because of the cost.

0:42:27	SPEAKER_03
 It is still double curve.

0:42:29	SPEAKER_03
 The flash.

0:42:30	SPEAKER_03
 The fruity.

0:42:31	SPEAKER_03
 The removable.

0:42:32	SPEAKER_03
 It's not double anymore.

0:42:35	SPEAKER_03
 Not double anymore.

0:42:36	SPEAKER_03
 Now, but this is what.

0:42:38	SPEAKER_03
 Was on the shield.

0:42:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:42:41	SPEAKER_03
 And the added function flag.

0:42:43	SPEAKER_03
 The parent control and touchscreen.

0:42:47	SPEAKER_03
 Just a summary of what we had discussed.

0:42:49	SPEAKER_03
 One small thing.

0:42:50	SPEAKER_01
 The added functions.

0:42:51	SPEAKER_01
 Was it included in the cost?

0:42:53	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think so.

0:42:55	SPEAKER_04
 It's very cheap.

0:42:56	SPEAKER_04
 It's very cheap.

0:42:57	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you come at the.

0:43:00	SPEAKER_02
 No, it's not very cheap but it's very necessary.

0:43:04	SPEAKER_02
 No, but it's.

0:43:06	SPEAKER_02
 Development inside corporation.

0:43:09	SPEAKER_02
 Like we don't have to buy parental control.

0:43:13	SPEAKER_02
 Our own people can.

0:43:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it has some cost.

0:43:18	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:43:19	SPEAKER_00
 So we can discuss that.

0:43:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:43:22	SPEAKER_03
 We can discuss that kind of things I think with.

0:43:26	SPEAKER_03
 With the board of.

0:43:27	SPEAKER_03
 Of direction.

0:43:28	SPEAKER_03
 What's the company call?

0:43:30	SPEAKER_03

0:43:32	SPEAKER_03
 Real reaction.

0:43:33	SPEAKER_03
 Real reaction.

0:43:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:43:36	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:43:39	SPEAKER_03

0:43:51	SPEAKER_03
