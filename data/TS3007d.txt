0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 Mr. Bake.

0:00:16	None
 You still have some minutes left, don't you?

0:00:19	None
 Yeah. Sorry.

0:00:21	None
 We still have some time left for the meeting.

0:00:25	None
 One minute.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_03
 Like a minute, so I'll do whatever you want.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah, that's I call that one.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_04
 I thought maybe you could display it on the screen, but it's not necessary.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_02
 No, this is just about there.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_02
 I have some shokk over here.

0:00:39	None
 It tastes funny.

0:00:42	None
 What if you don't?

0:00:44	SPEAKER_02
 It's like mixed chocolate milk and coffee or something.

0:00:49	None
 Oh, that's nasty.

0:00:51	None
 Pictures.

0:00:52	None
 Next after each other in the last place.

0:00:55	None
 Yeah, that would be easier with opening.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_04
 Did you put it in the chat hole?

0:01:01	None
 Yeah, let's see.

0:01:02	None
 Oh, we can begin.

0:01:03	None
 Move to the meeting room and bring your laptop.

0:01:06	None
 Thank you.

0:01:13	None
 That's a date too.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_02
 Welcome to the.

0:01:18	None
 Sorry.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, maybe good for a presentation if I just.

0:01:23	None
 Not sure this yet.

0:01:25	None
 No, I see.

0:01:26	None
 Okay, but welcome to the fourth meeting, the detailed design meeting, or we have to re-position on the details after remote control presented by your one-amountly project manager.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_03
 What we going to do once again, I'm going to take minutes.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_03
 So no presentation for me.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_03
 First, we have a prototype presentation by G and G.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_03
 You have to work some.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_03
 Evaluation.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_01
 Evaluation.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_03
 Evaluation criteria.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_03
 In combination with finance, I.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_03
 I received an Excel file.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_03
 Which we have to fill in later on.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_03
 You see.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_03
 And then we must see if we stay under the 12 and a half euro.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_03
 So that's.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_00
 That's a big problem.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_03
 So let's wait.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_03
 We have we have we must have some time for that.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_03
 Because it will be quite a lot of mathematics.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_03
 And after that, uh, uh, uh, evaluation of the process, how we, uh, how we have done it here with the smart work with, uh, with our laptops, with, uh, all, all this.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_03
 And, uh, afterwards, uh, we're closing.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_03
 Once again, 40 minutes.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, uh, let's start.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_03
 I will give the word to, um, G and G, for the prototype presentation.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_04
 Presentation.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_02
 I will try to write a little bit of the instruction.

0:03:12	None
 I will try.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_02
 Jane, Jane, Jane.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_02
 Jane and Jane.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_02
 Jane and Jane.

0:03:16	None
 Okay.

0:03:17	None
 Okay, guys.

0:03:18	None
 Take away.

0:03:19	None
 Take away.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_04
 This was our first concept.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_04
 We decided to use a single touch screen.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_04
 So we've worked out this concepts, how to hold it, where to put it.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_04
 Um, um, well, we began with, with a form of shape, where this, uh, is easy to hold in one hand, left or right hand, so we made a little bit less thick.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_04
 And, uh, have some artistic meaning.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yes, yes.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_04
 Nothing.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's better.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_04
 Um, well, during the meeting, I showed you the concept of placing the buttons on top, usable with the atom, and the menu structure, if necessary, with your other hand.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_04
 So it's going to hold it easily, and it has to be accessible with your other hand too, of course.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_04
 So we began working on the concept.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_01
 Well, as you saw, we would just have to basically mount with the panel LCD screen.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_01
 Well, these would be the main buttons.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_01
 You could change them later on in your own profile if you want to, but, well, standard, they will be delivered with this kind of, uh, setup, with the more, more advanced menu, uh, sitting right here, with the sub menus and stuff.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_01
 We made a top, uh, or front view, just like you want a back view.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_01
 As you can see, this, uh, here, there are, uh, two weird bumps in it.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_01
 This is for the added effect of, uh, well, uh, youth and dynamic, and, uh, this is for the artistic effect.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_01
 Well, what we figured is, uh, we'll show you a picture later on, you'll have more, a better idea after that, but the idea is for it to stay in balance with these two, uh, with these two.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_01
 So when you put it on the table, it will just lay down.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_01
 It won't roll around the stuff, but it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone, maybe, or like these older phones, you may get the idea.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_01
 So this is about, uh, how we figured it should be.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_01
 The panel, you would hide with some more, uh, rubber layers, like we discussed earlier on.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_01
 Uh, you would, you wouldn't see the, uh, straight panel, but more fluidly and round.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_04
 The panel is this, uh, of course, goes like this.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_04
 But the overlaying layer is, uh, a little bit, uh, curved and stuff.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_01
 And, uh, in these bumps, you could actually, uh, put some electronics so that the wood, you could make a more thinner, uh, design.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_01
 And that would actually look very nice.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_01
 And, uh, about color, what, hey?

0:06:03	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah, that this, um, can be held with your hands, so this, maximum is, oh, yeah, one and a half centimeters.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_04
 So you have room here for your battery, and maybe even other, uh, electronic chips.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_04
 So you can just be the, uh, the layer of the touch screen and some, some wires underneath it to make it as, uh, clean as possible in the middle for good, great.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_01
 Uh, as color state, do you have a picture in there?

0:06:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_01
 Now, this is the idea about, uh, the bumps.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_01
 You can see there's a, a very, a useful, uh, dynamic, uh, exterior.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_01
 You just want to hold it if you, uh, you are young and, uh, dynamic like us.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_02
 Like, uh, Easter egg.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's like, but this is for children.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_01
 We, we want more adult version, but this is like a remote control for children.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_01
 It's called a we-mode.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_01
 We-mode.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_01
 A we-mode.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_01
 A we-mode.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_01
 Hey, that's actually a brilliant marketing stand.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_02
 Well, where the hell got it mine?

0:07:03	SPEAKER_01
 So this is actually basically the idea.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_01
 We, we just want to build a more adult version of, of this.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_01
 I can imagine that.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_01
 And, and for colors, we, we figured starting with basic colors like, uh, white or metallic gray.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_01
 There was some, uh, technological colors actually.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_04
 It would be best to appeal to a broad public and make the coffers exchangeable.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_04
 So the young people will buy an orange in a red, you know, blue, and whatever.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_04
 But when, uh, all our people, they go in the shop and they see, uh, an orange, um, remote control, it would be less appealing than a white one.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_04
 And young people, we think, are a little bit more flexible.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_04
 I think, I'll buy for a couple of euros and no, nice hit.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_02
 So that you can pick a cover in the, uh, in the shop.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_04
 I think a cover is necessary because of the actual, the LCD screen.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_04
 So there must be some cheap standard cover, um, maybe white or something that comes with it.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_04
 And you can buy so we can make extra.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but you, you mustn't forget that, uh, our target aim is younger people.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_03
 We had decided to, uh, put some flashy, fruity colors in it.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_03
 And, uh, in the survey from Milan in Paris, uh, it, uh, it came out that, uh, the older people are, uh, more willing to, uh, to spend money on extra futures.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_03
 So I think, uh, it will be a better idea to have some, uh, the other way around.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_00
 The other way around.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_03
 The other way around.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_03
 As, as standard.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_03
 For the people who, uh, really want, uh, more sophisticated, more traditional look, they are willing to pay, uh, that.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_03
 They want, uh, they want more luxury stuff, but they have to money to do it and they want to buy that.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I might be, uh, perhaps, alright.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_01
 I would, I would actually agree with this sounds logical.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_02
 Another idea.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_02
 Uh, maybe we could, uh, develop a cover, uh, with wood style.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_02
 Then you please, uh, elder users as well.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_04
 Well, yeah, a color of wood style, a white, and, uh, a couple of, uh, fruity colors.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_04
 And, uh, delivered standard with a fruity color, but not too, not too much.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_04
 This is a banana and mango, not, not purple, orange and yellow.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_03
 But, uh, the main, I think, uh, the standard must be some kind of, uh, uh, attractive, flashy colors, not too, but, uh, a little, yeah, like, like, like, like, this, this, and,

0:09:49	SPEAKER_01
 this isn't too much, is it? Yeah.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the button, well, and the button is, uh, all, uh, except for the buttons,

0:09:57	SPEAKER_02
 it could be a standard model.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_01
 Uh, something like this would be nice. Okay.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_02
 That's, that's you for the most.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_04
 It's my time now.

0:10:08	None
 It's very dangerous.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_03
 The marketing expert.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_01
 Uh-oh.

0:10:15	None
 Okay.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_02
 During, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_02
 During, uh, design, design life cycle, we, uh, we made a lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_02
 Um, now it's the time to, uh, evaluate our prototype concept to, uh, to the past requirements.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_02
 So we're going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_02
 Um, we're going to do that with a seven point scale.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_02
 Opening a word document now.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_02
 One.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, okay.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_02
 Uh, I have to explain something.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_02
 We have to.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_02
 Uh, be consensive about things.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_02
 So there's to be a group, uh, group decision.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_03
 So we're going to, we're going to, we're going to vote.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_02
 The thing we need.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_02
 One.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_02
 The remote controls designed for people with age below 40.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_03
 Seven.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_02
 Seven is false.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_02
 Two.

0:11:52	None
 Yeah.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_03
 One more.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_01
 One.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_01
 I think most two.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_01
 It's not just designed for people under the age of 40.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_01
 It's also designed for people above 40.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_02
 So, uh, one is appropriate.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_02
 There are no, no, no.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_02
 We're like a four.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_01
 Now, uh, three or two or three because it's not just a question of aim that is designed for people with age below 40.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_01
 But it's also designed for people.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_01
 Exactly.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_01
 Exactly.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_04
 Also, it's about to be primary appealing to minus 40, but also to also for.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_02
 The second, the remote controls beautiful.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_02
 Wow.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_02
 According to us, it's one.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_02
 It's a marketing.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_02
 We have a wonderful, of course, you have to be, uh, very positive and enthusiastic about.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_02
 Perfect.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_02
 Good.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_02
 For the remote control, it's big, clear channel switching buttons.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_02
 There's the user interface.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_02
 User interface.

0:13:01	None
 Expert.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_01
 Data text buttons and volume buttons.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_01
 No, data text buttons.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_01
 Data text.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_01
 Data text in the menu.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_04
 False.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:16	None
 Yeah.

0:13:17	None
 Yeah.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_02
 Big and clear.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_02
 Big and clear.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_01
 Big and clear.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_04
 Big and clear.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_04
 You could make a telltakes button six, otherwise people read my, uh, I'm going to think we have no telltakes.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_01
 But the telltakes button, yeah, you could.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_01
 It's not your show, it's.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not a patient entirely unclear.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_01
 But so I wouldn't give it a seven.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_01
 I would give it a more than five for the six.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 Five?

0:13:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_03
 I was thinking very black and white.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_04
 Black and red.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you, Jerry.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_03
 Glad.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_02
 We have to get the same volume.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control is easy to be found.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we put fancy colors here.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_01
 And it has these all these fruity colors and it has a strange shape.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_01
 So yeah.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_04
 But trouble finding it.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_04
 It's not making any sounds.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_02
 No, okay.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_02
 So.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_02
 Look, if you put your normal remote control under your bed or you throw the remote control under your bed,

0:14:30	SPEAKER_04
 is it better finding a more make a difference? We have the better.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_04
 I think so.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_04
 My remote control is black.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_02
 A little bit maybe?

0:14:39	SPEAKER_02
 A little bit.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_03
 Or we can do it glow in the dark.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_03
 So it's even a dark place you feel.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_02
 I think five.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't really make a lot of...

0:14:51	SPEAKER_01
 Well, then I'll go for four.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_01
 Four?

0:14:54	SPEAKER_01
 Because four is between three and between three.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_04
 So I'll go for four.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_02
 I must see that.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_03
 Between four and six.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_03
 Well, according to the other remote controllers, there may be there in your TV room.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_03
 This one will stand out.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's better question actually.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's 51 or more small drawer.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_03
 You'll find it.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_03
 If it's like on your couch, you think what's that for kind of old stuff.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_02
 But the survey on their users was that they really lost it.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's stupid.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_02
 Not seeing it, but lost it in the house or something.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, okay.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_01
 If you see a strange shape lying somewhere, then you'd recognize it as, whoa, that's a strange...

0:15:44	SPEAKER_04
 That's a remote control.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_02
 What is that?

0:15:47	SPEAKER_02
 I agree, I agree.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_02
 Most of the time you lose it.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 So you're most control us fresh food to color.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_04
 I would call it juice too, because we decided not to make two fresh colors.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_02
 Not too fresh.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_02
 The remote controls made of soft material.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, rubber is kind of soft.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_01
 Kind of soft, but not too soft.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_03
 Not too silo.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_03
 Three.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, is it used?

0:16:11	SPEAKER_03
 Easy to use.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_03
 Easy to use?

0:16:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, can it be zero?

0:16:14	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I don't know.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's the kind of...

0:16:16	SPEAKER_01
 It's easy to use.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_02
 It's not the most easy to use.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_04
 No, you can do two, because it can be easier.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_04
 It can be easier.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_02
 Just with ten buttons.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but then you lose our function.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_04
 Functionality and our fancy look.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but the most easy to use.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_02
 It's just with one button.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_04
 But the other easy to use, because you have primary buttons always.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay, but not the most easy to use.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_01
 I'll go for two.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_01
 My vote's from two.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, my two.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_02
 We also have to compare it to the remote controls on the market nowadays.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, wait, it's just a minute.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_04
 Inspiration.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_03
 What's the time we also have to do the evaluation in the protocol?

0:17:03	SPEAKER_02
 Regular remote stuff.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I'm having...

0:17:06	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, 11.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_02
 The remote controls are innovative.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_04
 Two, one.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_04
 I agree, Tim.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_03
 Of course.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_03
 You have seen a more innovative thing in the remote control.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_02
 Remote control is...

0:17:18	SPEAKER_02
 Remote control.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_02
 Remote control.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_04
 One.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_04
 Very multifunctional.

0:17:24	None
 No.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control...

0:17:28	SPEAKER_02
 It has speech recognition.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_04
 This is used with speech recognition.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control has building games.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_04
 But maybe make it too, because the games are in a sub menu.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_04
 And it's not...

0:17:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but they are built in, so it's one.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_01
 I know, built in.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_01
 Last.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_02
 Last.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_01
 Last.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_01
 You're really like the parental advice.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_04
 Did you make this, Ruder?

0:18:01	SPEAKER_04
 I'd say fast.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, he made it.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_01
 He changed it, now.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_02
 I will...

0:18:09	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:18:10	None
 Do the...

0:18:12	SPEAKER_02
 The math.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, dear.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_02
 How is your turn?

0:18:15	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, thank you.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_03
 Let's see.

0:18:19	None
 Hmm?

0:18:22	SPEAKER_00
 Hmm.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_00
 Hmm.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, we have now to calculate the production cost.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_03
 If it's under 12.5 euro, then it's...

0:18:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_03
 But is it...

0:19:01	SPEAKER_03
 If it is...

0:19:02	SPEAKER_03
 No, this is right.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_03
 No, we design.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_03
 If you're under...

0:19:07	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_03
 If they...

0:19:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_03
 Tomorrow.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's good.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's...

0:19:15	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_03
 If the costs are under 12.5 euro, then we can move on to the...

0:19:21	SPEAKER_03
 Project evaluation, as we have experienced it.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_03
 Otherwise, we have to do a little redesign thingy.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:19:30	SPEAKER_03
 We have to fill in the numbers.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_03
 After components.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_03
 After components, we have to...

0:19:37	SPEAKER_03
 We want to do it in.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_03
 And see if we stay under the 12.5 euro.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_03
 So, do we have a hand dynamo?

0:19:49	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_03
 That's zero.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_03
 Battery one?

0:19:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_03
 Can I have one?

0:19:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_03
 Solar cells?

0:20:02	SPEAKER_03
 Zero.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_03
 Simple chip on print?

0:20:06	None
 No.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_03
 Simple chips.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_03
 Simple sensor.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_03
 Simple speaker.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_02
 A false chip.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_02
 It's three.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_02
 Three?

0:20:16	SPEAKER_02
 Three euros.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, one.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_02
 One thing?

0:20:19	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_03
 Three euros.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_01
 No, zero.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_01
 What's a sample sensor?

0:20:23	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's...

0:20:24	SPEAKER_01
 Speed recognition.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, speed recognition.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, okay.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_03
 One.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_03
 Zero.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_03
 Uncurved flat.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_03
 No, zero.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_03
 But is it...

0:20:33	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_03
 It's not made from a single uncurved thingy and then...

0:20:37	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_03
 And then...

0:20:39	SPEAKER_03
 No, okay.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's only once double-curved.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because the layer around it...

0:20:48	SPEAKER_04
 It's around the bubbles on the...

0:20:50	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_03
 We're now in a problem.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_03
 Because we have...

0:20:55	SPEAKER_03
 Which...

0:20:56	SPEAKER_03
 11 euros.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have anything else.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, go on.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, go on.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_01
 We'll see...

0:21:02	SPEAKER_01
 We'll see how much we are over budget.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_04
 Because you step a little to the result, man.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, sorry.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_03
 Two.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_03
 Rubber?

0:21:11	SPEAKER_03
 Zero.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_03
 Detanium.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_03
 Detanium, no.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_04
 Special...

0:21:15	SPEAKER_04
 Special color?

0:21:16	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think so, not.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's a standard color.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, this is a special color.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_03
 We want to make the wood colors.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, if you're honest with your type...

0:21:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but it's a special color.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_02
 That's an adult.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's another brand.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_02
 That's another article...

0:21:34	SPEAKER_02
 To sell.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but we can't...

0:21:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's true.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_03
 But yeah, it doesn't account for this.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_04
 No, you will finish and list first and then look back.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, they're push-button, no.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_04
 Skull wheel, no.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_03
 Skull wheel, no.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_03
 In case you'll...

0:21:51	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yes, one.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_03
 One.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_03
 Button, no.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have first.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_01
 No, we're only four here, all over budget.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so what's the thing we can change?

0:22:06	SPEAKER_01
 Well, are there...

0:22:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so we can make it single-curved or uncurved.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_00
 Can I...

0:22:11	SPEAKER_00
 I say something?

0:22:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, of course.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_03
 Can I say something as project managers?

0:22:16	SPEAKER_03
 Just good on...

0:22:17	SPEAKER_03
 The kinetic thing.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_03
 Can we just skip it?

0:22:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_03
 Because you have to shake it, but that's not really enough.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we just put a bit better in it.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_04
 Mobile phone nowadays.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_02
 Daniel.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yo.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_02
 What do you talk about?

0:22:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_02
 What do you think about putting a battery in it?

0:22:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_02
 But also selling like the coffers, a docking station, just apart from the thing, so that you can put...

0:22:45	SPEAKER_02
 Rechargeable batteries in it.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, just...

0:22:48	SPEAKER_04
 But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_04
 This is just...

0:22:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, not really enough.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_03
 But we forget about the kinetic.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sure.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_03
 Well, if we do that, we shall leave 30 to health.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, well, you can go from double-curved to single-curved.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_01
 Of course.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_01
 And that will solve the budget problem.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so we have to make...

0:23:08	SPEAKER_03
 But the single-curved...

0:23:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_03
 Single-curved is just...

0:23:12	SPEAKER_04
 It's just...

0:23:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, well, the single-curved...

0:23:14	SPEAKER_04
 One-curved.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_04
 And not the back-curved, I think.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, okay.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_03
 Exactly, yeah.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_03
 That's one option.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_03
 That's one option.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_03
 And then, yeah, we could have it.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_03
 But it's a main point of the...

0:23:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but we'll do it.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_04
 So, then we have to cut out.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_04
 We got one.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_04
 We got a tip.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_03
 There's a little bit of problem.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_03
 No, that can be done.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_03
 So, although can we make it with a bag of...

0:23:39	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_03
 A little less...

0:23:41	SPEAKER_03
 Problems.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_03
 Hey.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_02
 Those are...

0:23:45	SPEAKER_02
 Arks.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_02
 What are they for?

0:23:47	SPEAKER_02
 Blue...

0:23:48	SPEAKER_03
 Blue...

0:23:49	SPEAKER_03
 Fill in the name of the event.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_03
 Just...

0:23:52	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_03
 Explanation.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_03
 I can delete it for you if you want.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, no, no.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_03
 So, if we do this, we are on 12 and a half Euro.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_03
 And we're done.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but does it fit without design?

0:24:06	SPEAKER_04
 Do we actually add that?

0:24:08	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the only thing that don't...

0:24:11	SPEAKER_03
 Single curves.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, single curves, but there's a curve in it.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_04
 So, we just make the bubbles cut off the back and then...

0:24:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we just make it flat.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_01
 But...

0:24:21	SPEAKER_02
 You do look at...

0:24:22	SPEAKER_02
 Look, what is the...

0:24:24	SPEAKER_02
 If you make it double-curved, it costs one Euro more.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_04
 But...

0:24:31	SPEAKER_02
 You make it optional.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_02
 No, but...

0:24:34	SPEAKER_02
 Does it have a lot of extra...

0:24:37	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, function more...

0:24:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, it does.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_01
 Does it have added work?

0:24:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, aesthetic value, but not function.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's really aesthetic value.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, you make like 11.5 Euro as a profit.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_02
 Instead of 12.5, but...

0:24:55	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if 12.5 is a fixed price.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_02
 Now, let's assume it is.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_01
 We wish it assumed that it is.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_01
 I think the kinetic would be a marketing promotion.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_01
 If you promote kinetic...

0:25:12	SPEAKER_01
 kinetic remote control, I mean, that would sell better than a normal remote control.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_03
 Do you think?

0:25:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_03
 Well, now you can shake your remote control.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I mean, you can go into your neighborhood and tell me, Ha, mic remote control is kinetic.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_01
 You have a standard old,

0:25:30	SPEAKER_02
 electric control remote control.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_04
 What about all the environment freaks? Yeah, but it does fit in a cost profile.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's...

0:25:42	SPEAKER_04
 Good like this one.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_04
 You make a make a...

0:25:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_04
 And a specialized extra gold version.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_03
 Because if you want to go to kinetic, you're an attorney in a health and you must go to flat.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_03
 And I think now it's more of a compromise.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_03
 And if you make the single curve, just a big curve, then it's...

0:26:07	SPEAKER_00
 That is one big...

0:26:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, one big...

0:26:10	SPEAKER_03
 Good curve.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_03
 I was going to say nasty words, but I get it.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_03
 This is strange, by the way.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_03
 Wood is cheaper than rubber.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_03
 We thought that wood would be more expensive.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_04
 But it's not as good as a figure.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_03
 It's just cut down some trees.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, maybe.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_03
 But this is it?

0:26:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, this is it.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, this makes it more...

0:26:37	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to save it.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_01
 It is possible, but you can't use double curves for titanium.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_01
 That's one of the functionality.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, well...

0:26:48	SPEAKER_02
 Considering we have...

0:26:51	SPEAKER_02
 We have to do all those hours again.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_02
 Back.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_02
 One back?

0:26:57	SPEAKER_02
 Gosh, no, really sorry.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we were above.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_03
 We did a little redesign.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's that rule.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_03
 Now it's about time to talk about this project.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_03
 Some things.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_03
 Were there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings?

0:27:24	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't think so.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_02
 There was a lot of room for it.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_02
 But that's mainly because of the information that was delivered to us.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_02
 It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_02
 I couldn't go on the internet and fix my own stuff.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_03
 That's true.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think you two, especially you and then you both had the less creative roles in the project.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_04
 That's true.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_04
 I think you could just sign up and remove it, if you'd like.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_03
 That's true.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_01
 I think you're room and I.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_01
 We had more design.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_01
 We had more room for creativity than you two.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's true.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_03
 How about the leadership?

0:28:19	SPEAKER_02
 Leadership was crappy.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_01
 The leadership wasn't crappy.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_01
 It was the leader that was crappy.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, thank you.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_01
 Leadership was okay.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_04
 No, we're done.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_04
 Example of crappy.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_02
 Leadership was...

0:28:35	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, yeah.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_02
 I thought the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_02
 You could have...

0:28:43	SPEAKER_02
 It was your first no disrespect or something, but you could have structured it a little bit more.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_02
 I was talking most of the time, the first meeting.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_04
 You could have shut up, you know?

0:28:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_03
 I know the situation too.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_03
 I was also very unhappy, very unsatisfied about me.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_03
 About the first meeting.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_03
 I hope...

0:29:08	SPEAKER_03
 And we will never do it again.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_03
 Get better.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_03
 I think the last two meetings, also we reached some good decisions.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, more consensus.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we were more constructive.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_03
 So that's cool.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_03
 Teamwork?

0:29:26	SPEAKER_03
 Well, maybe that's only...

0:29:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, it's for us.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we work together on the project, but everybody has their own tasks.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_03
 More like presentations, some points we're discussing.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_03
 Really teamwork where you two...

0:29:40	SPEAKER_03
 Two or three.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it went well.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_01
 It's just...

0:29:45	SPEAKER_01
 The heart of feelings.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_01
 Stupid pain by the...

0:29:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we had some trouble with the pain by the way.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you must push here a little while.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but there was something difficult.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_04
 Just write your name right now.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_04
 Try to write your name.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_04
 Just a little bit smaller, ankle-width quicker now.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_04
 You can go quicker because then it won't notice it.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_04
 Ah, he knows how it works.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_04
 I followed a masterclass for the small one.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's the main issue.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_03
 So, about this one, you were dealing with...

0:30:29	SPEAKER_03
 The digital pen?

0:30:31	SPEAKER_03
 The idea is great, but the work probably...

0:30:34	SPEAKER_03
 The digital pen, I thought the first time I did individual work, I used it.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_02
 But the first two meetings, I brought up the project.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_02
 I was thinking about the digital pen.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but the first two meetings, I brought up with me, but I didn't use it at all after the first meeting.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_02
 No, I have a feeling.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_02
 But it's not real useful.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_01
 No, it doesn't have that much added value to it.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_04
 As I said a few moments ago, I would like myself to write with a normal pen because it must...

0:31:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's almost the same concept, but you can just...

0:31:14	SPEAKER_04
 You can simply put it on your scanner, it's the same concept, it must depend on...

0:31:18	SPEAKER_04
 You have to download the software, it's very slow.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_03
 And it is still your own handwriting, it's up and up and...

0:31:26	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't give any added value.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_03
 No, not really.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_03
 And the smartboard is useful, but the pen is not user-friendly, I think.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, not user-friendly.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_03
 It takes a lot of time to draw things and write things.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_02
 It's not very precise, we're trying to...

0:31:45	SPEAKER_04
 Like when you do this.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and try to write your name in a normal size, yeah?

0:31:54	SPEAKER_02
 Smaller?

0:31:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, smaller, just when you're writing on a letter.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but that's not...

0:32:01	SPEAKER_03
 When you send an add-up for an audience, you don't gonna write...

0:32:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, as you saw on this drawing, it's open, open this one or that one.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we had more problems even here.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_04
 When we tried to draw these buttons, it's almost impossible, we can clear the values when you're...

0:32:22	SPEAKER_03
 But maybe there's some function with...

0:32:24	SPEAKER_03
 No, it isn't.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_04
 And the eraser was not a problem, it's this large.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, you try to erase this line.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I'm gonna erase my name.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_04
 I'm gonna erase my name.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's a big eraser.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_04
 New ideas?

0:32:43	SPEAKER_04
 What kind of new ideas?

0:32:45	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the idea of the touchscreen is...

0:32:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, two years.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_03
 Go on.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just...

0:32:54	SPEAKER_04
 New ideas about the working of this software, about the project, about remote control.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what I mean.

0:33:03	None
 What?

0:33:05	None
 What?

0:33:06	None
 What's the word?

0:33:09	SPEAKER_03
 Did you word what you said?

0:33:12	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what I mean.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what I mean.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I have some figure.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_02
 Here.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_02
 The evaluation.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_02
 The mean number is 1.8, 1.86.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_02
 So that's fairly good, I think.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, because what does it mean?

0:33:34	SPEAKER_02
 So true.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_02
 That...

0:33:36	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, the requirements...

0:33:38	SPEAKER_02
 Are true or varied?

0:33:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, okay.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_03
 Excellent.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_03
 But the new ideas found with working with this software?

0:33:53	None
 Not really.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_04
 Not really.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_04
 You have to improve it.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_04
 The concept is okay.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_04
 I think, but it has to be quicker.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_04
 It's still opening my program.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_04
 Almost all my entire computers locked up.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_04
 You need process.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_04
 And it just takes too many time.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_04
 People will still feel the need to write it quickly on a page and not download it and save it.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_03
 You are expected to be more user friendly.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_04
 When you use a pen, you can just draw like you normally.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe the idea you proposed is a screen here.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_02
 You draw it and it's placed over there.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_04
 Or at least when you don't have to adapt to technology, you can write in a way you normally write.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_04
 Now you have to keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_04
 That's a very bad concept.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_02
 That's very bad.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_02
 I think that this is better than regular flipovers.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it can be saved easier.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_04
 But if you're in normal flipover, a lot of people write text.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_04
 It's not a text option.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_04
 Writing text, you've got to really do your best.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_03
 And maybe some functions for a circle or a square.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_03
 You have to draw it yourself.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_04
 Now maybe even insert picture.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_04
 If you have some presentation.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_01
 Or text function.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_01
 Type text.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_01
 That would be an X-level.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_02
 Well, insert image.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_02
 Isn't available.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_02
 Because then you could picture from scanner clip.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_02
 That can be done already.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_02
 But not the hyperlink.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_03
 Predefined squares.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_02
 Hey, what if you do like hyperlink?

0:35:54	SPEAKER_04
 There will be a Google.com.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_02
 Real reaction door for now.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_02
 That's okay.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_04
 You'll just make a link in.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_04
 Well, that's nice.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_04
 There's one way to get double-click it.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe if you're not using the erase.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_03
 Or erase.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_02
 Something else.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:25	None
 Select.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_02
 Double-click.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_03
 That.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_03
 Are you have, as you saw, you have a little, you can, yeah.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_03
 You can go.

0:36:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_03
 There.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_03
 So there, the functionality is there.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_03
 But it's not ideal.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_03
 And it's very, it costs a lot of time to use.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_04
 To use.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_03
 And that's a pity.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_03
 If you, if you have 30, 40 minutes, yeah, or just kind of things.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_03
 And we are now with four people.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_03
 Well, imagine you are here with 10 people.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_04
 Everyone has to.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_04
 That's obviously the case from here with the management.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_04
 You get two minutes to make your case.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:11	SPEAKER_04
 Two minutes to drawing.

0:37:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_04
 You'll rather use PowerPoints and work it out in a fun.

0:37:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_04
 And one or two things you have to draw when you're there.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_04
 This is the flip board.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_02
 What I really miss also is, is it, is it a hurdle?

0:37:26	SPEAKER_02
 It's a decision, decision system like, with the evaluation.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_02
 You have to, both like, what do you want, the one or two?

0:37:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:42	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe a little application like, give your number and click one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, just like you said with the screen, which you can write, also, a voting and I can just,

0:37:59	SPEAKER_02
 voting application, just a little group, group decision application.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_01
 But the problem is, well, you can't discuss anything.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you can, but you will discuss a lot less than, like we did now.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, one person maybe said free, but we said, no, I'll think too, because this and this, and then you can react on it.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:24	SPEAKER_01
 But if you put a free on it, just figure out, well, everybody knows what I'm knowing, so they'll all just put it to on.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, of course.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_02
 But you can still discuss about it, but click it in an application.

0:38:38	SPEAKER_02
 That's a lot easier to process.

0:38:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay, for processing.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_01
 But then I think the idea of one person entering it and the rest discussing it, that isn't that bad idea, actually.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:52	SPEAKER_01
 Not that your opinion isn't valued, but still.

0:38:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:57	None
 Yeah.

0:38:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:38:59	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:39:01	SPEAKER_04
 So, manager.

0:39:02	SPEAKER_03
 That's it.

0:39:03	SPEAKER_04
 Well, just about, just when are we going to produce it?

0:39:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:07	SPEAKER_03
 Tomorrow.

0:39:08	SPEAKER_03
 Celebrate.

0:39:09	SPEAKER_03
 Because we're within the budget, the project is a failureite, but before we go to celebrate, I have a little question which you can't answer, because there must be some kind of entry port.

0:39:22	SPEAKER_03
 I'm busy with the entry port right now.

0:39:24	SPEAKER_03
 You might think, what the hell is he doing?

0:39:26	SPEAKER_02
 What is an entry port?

0:39:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, about all the meetings, what we have decided.

0:39:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:32	SPEAKER_03
 A report of this day.

0:39:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:34	SPEAKER_03
 That must be made, but I don't know.

0:39:36	SPEAKER_03
 Here is the standing.

0:39:37	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we can celebrate now, but the entry port is.

0:39:39	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:39:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, 10 minutes left.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_02
 I ran.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, if not, 10 minutes left to finish of the entry.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:39:46	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that can be done.

0:39:47	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we can do it together.

0:39:48	SPEAKER_03
 You can see when I've.

0:39:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I will put it on a storyboard.

0:39:55	SPEAKER_03
 You can see it.

0:39:57	None
 Yeah.

0:39:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:40:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:40:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:40:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:40:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:40:04	SPEAKER_03
 I think it will be your, my better version.

0:40:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:40:06	SPEAKER_03
 It's a three, 75 pages.

0:40:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:40:11	SPEAKER_01
 75 pages.

0:40:12	SPEAKER_03
 Well, just a moment.

0:40:15	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, Daniel.

0:40:19	SPEAKER_02
 You want a chair?

0:40:23	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe.

0:40:24	SPEAKER_02
 A chair, man.

0:40:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, man.

0:40:27	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no, no, I'm just.

0:40:28	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, you can, you can read it.

0:40:30	SPEAKER_03
 And here it is.

0:40:31	SPEAKER_01
 So you finish it, actually, so we just have to read it.

0:40:35	SPEAKER_01
 And so yes or no?

0:40:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:40:37	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's not read only, but it's not five minutes yet for finishing.

0:40:45	SPEAKER_03
 This is about the functional design.

0:40:47	SPEAKER_03
 Management expert.

0:40:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:40:49	SPEAKER_03
 You have to change that.

0:40:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:40:51	SPEAKER_03
 When I said it, I remember I said it only version.

0:40:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but you can save it on another name.

0:40:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:40:59	SPEAKER_03
 Mark thing, actually.

0:41:00	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:41:03	SPEAKER_03
 About three functions, which are most used, and which must immediately be visible on our remote control.

0:41:12	SPEAKER_03
 It must be simple to use, very clear what to do, and the younger people.

0:41:17	SPEAKER_03
 So this is really about what kind of things must be in it.

0:41:21	SPEAKER_02
 And maybe.

0:41:24	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:41:31	SPEAKER_03
 I understand you.

0:41:32	SPEAKER_03
 I can talk a little bit.

0:41:33	SPEAKER_02
 You have to pull switch channels at the top, because that's the most functional.

0:41:39	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, okay.

0:41:40	SPEAKER_02
 Data text at the second.

0:41:42	SPEAKER_03
 I really didn't follow.

0:41:44	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, volume changing second.

0:41:47	SPEAKER_03
 So this one's for switch.

0:41:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:41:49	SPEAKER_03
 You go there and you go there.

0:41:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:41:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:41:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:41:56	SPEAKER_03
 Go on.

0:41:57	SPEAKER_03
 Well, maybe I can do it.

0:41:59	SPEAKER_03
 One, two, three.

0:42:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:42:01	SPEAKER_03
 Very good.

0:42:02	SPEAKER_03
 Three.

0:42:03	SPEAKER_03
 If the order is in this important, that's the word for four.

0:42:07	SPEAKER_03
 The order.

0:42:10	SPEAKER_03
 Then the conceptual design.

0:42:14	SPEAKER_03
 Well, all the things we have discussed, the energy, which turn out to be a battery.

0:42:20	SPEAKER_03
 So that's working.

0:42:21	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe you can add it later.

0:42:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:42:23	SPEAKER_03
 We decided.

0:42:24	SPEAKER_03
 Because, yeah, because because.

0:42:27	SPEAKER_03
 It is still double-carved.

0:42:28	SPEAKER_03
 The rubber, the plushie, the fruity, the removable.

0:42:32	SPEAKER_03
 It's not double anymore, eh?

0:42:35	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no anymore.

0:42:36	SPEAKER_03
 But this is what was initialed.

0:42:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:42:41	SPEAKER_03
 And the added functions like that are snake, it's in the parent control, touch screen.

0:42:46	SPEAKER_03
 So it's just a summary of what we had discussed.

0:42:49	SPEAKER_01
 One small thing, the added functions.

0:42:51	SPEAKER_01
 Was it included in the cost?

0:42:53	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think so.

0:42:54	SPEAKER_01
 That's very cheap.

0:42:55	SPEAKER_04
 It's very cheap.

0:42:56	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you come at.

0:43:00	SPEAKER_02
 No, it's not very cheap, but it's very necessary.

0:43:03	SPEAKER_02
 No, but it's development inside corporation.

0:43:09	SPEAKER_02
 Like we don't have to buy parental control around people can.

0:43:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I still.

0:43:16	SPEAKER_02
 It has some thoughts.

0:43:18	SPEAKER_03
 But, okay.

0:43:19	SPEAKER_00
 So we can discuss that.

0:43:20	SPEAKER_03
 We can discuss that kind of things, I think, with the board of the lecture.

0:43:28	SPEAKER_03
 What's the company call?

0:43:30	SPEAKER_03
 I just keep forgetting it.

0:43:33	SPEAKER_03
 Real reaction.

0:43:34	SPEAKER_03
 Real reaction.

0:43:35	SPEAKER_03
 I thought.

0:43:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:43:37	SPEAKER_03
 Real reaction.

0:43:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you can ask.

0:43:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:43:41	SPEAKER_03
 So anybody misses something here about the end conclusion.

0:43:45	SPEAKER_03
 But yeah, okay, that's what I'm going to write.

0:43:47	SPEAKER_03
 The end conclusion, that's all I'd say.

0:43:50	SPEAKER_03
 And here nothing.

0:43:51	SPEAKER_04
 The decision to make the buttons on the top and the menu on the bottom.

0:43:58	SPEAKER_04
 And clearly touch screen you've mentioned.

0:44:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, touch screen I've been thinking about.

0:44:04	SPEAKER_02
 But the decisions are put in the conclusion, I think.

0:44:08	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:44:09	SPEAKER_02
 Why we decided to use a flat LCD.

0:44:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay.

0:44:13	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I'm going to redesign something now.

0:44:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:44:18	SPEAKER_03
 Because I think it will have five minutes from to finish meeting.

0:44:24	SPEAKER_04
 Anything for you change anything maybe you saved the first.

0:44:38	SPEAKER_04
 You can select file and export and then the feedback files.

0:44:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but then you add the same thing.

0:44:45	SPEAKER_04
 Well, eight.

0:44:46	SPEAKER_04
 We have another blank one.

0:44:48	SPEAKER_04
 For example, children.

0:44:49	SPEAKER_02
 Anything?

0:44:50	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, wait.

0:44:51	SPEAKER_02

0:45:24	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, that's cool.

0:45:40	SPEAKER_03

0:46:54	SPEAKER_01
