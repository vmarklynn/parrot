0:00:00	None
 Oh that rope Okay

0:00:25	SPEAKER_00
 So, it's the detailed design meeting. So we're going last meeting.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_00
 So first, Mark and Rama are going to present the prototype.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_00
 Then Samu will propose some criteria to evaluate this prototype.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_00
 Then we are going to do some finance to see if it is feasible.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_00
 Then at the end we will evaluate ourselves as a team.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_00
 So first, let's see the prototype.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_02
 Here we have our prototype model.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_00
 And you have some slides?

0:01:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, some slides.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_06
 So in which... in participant 3 prototype.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_06
 So this is our remote control.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_06
 It's a working prototype.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_06
 You can use it now by switching all these buttons.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_06
 So first I present as we came to this perfect model and then we'll give some technical specifications.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_06
 So let's start.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_06
 Please, next slide.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_06
 We analyzed all the fruits and contacted NASA and made some real good.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, if you can see this and the stars are showing that we are doing right and society will accept it, for sure.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_06
 Making some analysis of different fruits, we choose the ultimate form, ultimate colors and ultimate smell of it.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_06
 Please, next slide.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_06
 But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea because it's the most of the model, the ever-murdering material we can select.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_06
 And it's practical and it still sits for our needs.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_06
 So please press something.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_06
 And as I said...

0:03:15	SPEAKER_06
 Hey!

0:03:16	SPEAKER_06
 Hey, this person, everyone is really, really glad to obtain this such a device.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_06
 So you can touch it with your own hand.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_00
 Can I?

0:03:37	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_04
 What do you say?

0:03:40	SPEAKER_04
 It says...

0:03:41	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_03
 I'll buy it.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_05
 What do you say if I need to?

0:03:50	SPEAKER_05
 Hopefully my daughter will like it.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_06
 And we got the answer.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_06
 Yes, of course.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_05
 Of course.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_06
 Of course.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_06
 Please, next slide.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_06
 This is the prototype you can have a look at it.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_06
 And that's all I wanted to say.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_06
 Now it's technical specification by our colleague.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_03
 So there's a button missing.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_03
 This is really flexible.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_03
 I have your button.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_02
 Option.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_02
 So function.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_02
 So as we discussed, we have to switch on, switch off whenever we want.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_02
 And so we have buttons and using LCD or like you can use this jock wheel and select which are option on LCD and then do on and off.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_02
 Then you will have volume control.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_02
 So you can press this button to increase or decrease your volume.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_02
 And we have some LCD controls like switching the LCD display.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_02
 If you want to use LCD or you don't want, you can just use normal button.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_02
 And we have speech recognizer.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_02
 Here you have microphone and then it records your voice and then try to recognize and it converts into the action and location finder.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_02
 And we want to do the location basically using speech recognizer.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_02
 You can just say, where is my remote control or you can just give some nickname to your remote control.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_01
 And then Bob, you can see it.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_01
 You are tired then.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_01
 You can use it.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_02
 So our theme is no fruits, mainly strawberry.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_02
 So you can have, oh these are strawberries.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_02
 And then you can see the look LCD and all the switches.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_00
 Colorful.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_02
 So in the material, we want to stick to titanium.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_05
 And you want to root spelting, spelky, titanium.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_05
 I didn't know it exists but that's great.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_02
 So we want to have simple and perfect shapes like I shown in these fonts.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_02
 You can have your own designs and you can feel simple designs.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_02
 And you can choose colors on your day for each day or even many colors.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_00
 You mean we can change the color.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_00
 That's for the LCD or for the titanium.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_02
 For the LCD.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, okay.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_02
 For the LCD.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_02
 We have titanium.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_02
 It's still working on titanium.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_06
 And you can start with LCD, you can ask Bob, it's Tuesday.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_01
 Bob, please.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_01
 Hey, you know you're being today.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_02
 Tuesday color.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_02
 Even you can configure your colors for each day, depending on your mood or black.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_02
 You can have many colors on weekend.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_00
 And wait, what are the strawberries for?

0:07:11	SPEAKER_02
 These are like sensors.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_02
 Of course, what do you think?

0:07:19	SPEAKER_04
 That's strawberry.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_00
 They're useful.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_00
 Strawberry.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_02
 So after this meeting, we will propose a party for our success.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_02
 For large meeting.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_02
 So if you are vegetarian or you have any options, please let us know.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, and we can just treat some strawberries first.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_00
 We'll see you in the financial party.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_00
 That's what we get.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_06
 Let's make a party first.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_02
 Then we can discuss.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_02
 We can...

0:08:05	SPEAKER_00
 With the five, 50 million, we first make a party.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_02
 Then we can have all of its plans, money is left.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_00
 What a design.

0:08:17	None
 Okay.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:08:19	SPEAKER_00
 It's my turn.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, let's see if you meet the evaluation criteria.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_05
 So evaluation, please.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_05
 So you made a very nice prototype and I think we now need all together to try to evaluate it, to see if it makes sense to do it, if it fulfills what we wanted to and things like that.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_05
 So...

0:08:56	SPEAKER_05
 Next slide, please.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_05
 As you know, before going and producing these strawberries, remote control, it's very important to first verify if it makes sense, if we have a chance to sell it.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_05
 So we need to evaluate it and try to do it in a quantitative way as much as we can.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_05
 So what I propose is that we are going to have this scale from one to seven.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_05
 One, meaning that yes, it fulfills the criterion, whatever it is.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_05
 And seven, meaning no, it doesn't fulfill at all.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_05
 And while going to list all the criteria, I'm going to go to that next slide.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_05
 And together try to evaluate this according to this criterion from one to seven.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_05
 And then we're just going to have an average which will give us the value of our remote control.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe we can have a look at the criteria.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_05
 So these are the criteria I thought were important.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_05
 Of course, this can be discussed, but let's see.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_05
 So let's suppose, so we have fancy here.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_05
 And we have this scale from one to seven.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_05
 We have four in the middle.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_02
 So, what do you think?

0:10:31	SPEAKER_05
 Is it fancy?

0:10:33	SPEAKER_00
 No, I think that fancy we can say it is fancy.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_05
 It is very, very fancy.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_05
 Have you ever seen something like that?

0:10:42	SPEAKER_00
 I am not the only one who thinks.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_05
 What do you think?

0:10:47	SPEAKER_05
 Feel the weight.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_05
 The weight is later.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_05
 I think it is quite fancy.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_05
 It is one or two.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_05
 Two, maybe two.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_05
 So here, two.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_05
 Then we have technology.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_05
 So what about technology?

0:11:17	SPEAKER_05
 We have speech recognition, location based.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_05
 We have a CD.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_05
 Change color.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_05
 I think it is one for that.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_02
 Robustness.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_05
 So let's suppose my daughter take it and throw it away.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_05
 Do you think it makes sense that it is going to live again?

0:11:48	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe not the prototype.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_05
 Let's try.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_05
 Oh my god.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_06
 We just lost one strawberry.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_06
 No, but it is still working.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_05
 You have to go to a bonus.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_05
 So it is not so bad.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_05
 It is looks like it is robust.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_05
 It is useful.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_05
 The question is, does it have the minimum requirement of remote control?

0:12:24	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_05
 These buttons are not clear, but you have at least next.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_02
 What is the next challenge?

0:12:34	SPEAKER_00
 This is volume control and channel change.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_02
 You can do it on LCD using this.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_05
 Scrolling all the options.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_05
 Because LCD is not touch control, touch screen, you cannot go to channel 25.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_06
 You can by using the...

0:12:54	SPEAKER_06
 You go...

0:12:57	SPEAKER_06
 So it is a basic mode.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_06
 You have just two buttons and a drug dial.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_06
 If you go to the side, it is channel up, channel down.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_06
 If you want to make 25, you push on this.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_06
 You select 20, you select 5.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_05
 It is much longer than tapping 25.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_05
 Don't you think so?

0:13:27	SPEAKER_05
 We can go.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_05
 It is nice because people don't go there.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_05
 So what do you think for it?

0:13:39	SPEAKER_05
 It seems to be useful.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_02
 If we need to address, we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on LCD.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_00
 Let me understand why, because I am not sure.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_00
 This one is two direction.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_00
 Up, down or left, right.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_00
 Which one is that?

0:14:01	SPEAKER_06
 The job is to control the cursor on the LCD.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_02
 You will have blocks and you will select which one.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_05
 I would say that...

0:14:12	SPEAKER_05
 No, it looks useful.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_05
 Two or three?

0:14:16	SPEAKER_05
 Two or three?

0:14:19	SPEAKER_05
 So size and weight.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_05
 Is it the effective size and weight?

0:14:29	SPEAKER_05
 Is it real size, real weight?

0:14:31	SPEAKER_05
 Size is almost size.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_02
 Size is going to be that.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_02
 The weight will be a bit lighter.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_02
 Sure, without titanium.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_06
 Titanium is going to be lighter.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_06
 It is going to be lighter.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_05
 This seems to be very heavy.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_05
 From my daughter, for instance.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_05
 I am not sure if she can use it.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_02
 The size should be okay.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_05
 I will put a three for that.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_05
 I have not seen the weight.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_05
 Color and shape.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_05
 Color seems to have several colors for the LCD.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_05
 It is not very clear what is the color of the case.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_05
 The case is too light.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_05
 It is going to be too light.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_00
 That is nice.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_00
 I think it is good.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_00
 What about the strawberries and top?

0:15:32	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe I am not trendy.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_05
 It is this fruit and vegetable year.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_00
 They are not useful.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_05
 I think it is useful as I just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_05
 Whether it is fancier or not now.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_05
 We have to decide.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_00
 I would have found more fancy that the fruits are useful.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_05
 That maybe the fruit may be here.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_02
 Then it is difficult to use.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_02
 We are just giving the fruits for more fanciness and more and more.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we can have rubber or some sponches and stuff for strawberries.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_05
 It seems to be even so clear.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_00
 I am not sure if it was like this.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_02
 It is not really good anymore.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_02
 These are kind of rubber things.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_02
 We can provide many different colors.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_06
 It covers all the angles.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_06
 Even if it is very rounded.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_06
 But still we have some rubber fruit here.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_06
 It is completely secure to live with children.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_00
 You feel like it is something of protection for the remote control.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_02
 We have sensors here and here.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_02
 Even if you do not put it on, this is really...

0:17:09	SPEAKER_02
 I suggest a 3.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_05
 Everybody does not seem to be convinced.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_05
 Although it is great.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_05
 You have good arguments.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_05
 The last one is adaptive.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_05
 This is not as important as the other one.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_05
 But can we adapt it to each personal use?

0:17:32	SPEAKER_06
 Sure, just look at it.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_07
 It is fully adaptive.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_05
 So you can fit it to your palm.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_05
 Do you think you are going to be able to do that with Titan?

0:17:47	SPEAKER_00
 It is fudge Titan.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_05
 If you are able to do that, then I think it deserves a one.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_05
 Let's go for one.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_05
 Now we have to do the average.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_05
 It is 2.17.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_05
 2.17.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_05
 That is nice.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_05
 I think we have a good thing.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_05
 That is all I have to say about evaluation.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_05
 It is a good evaluation.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_02
 It seems to be good.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_00
 Thanks.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_00
 Now it has to fulfill the financial criteria.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_05
 How many batteries do we need?

0:18:57	SPEAKER_05
 One battery?

0:18:59	SPEAKER_05
 Two.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_02
 This is one.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_05
 Two batteries are one.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_00
 No, number is one.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no, no.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_04
 You never use an XL?

0:19:22	SPEAKER_04
 What is the limit?

0:19:26	SPEAKER_06
 It is okay that I do not know.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_06
 12 bucks.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_04
 Check the number also.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_05
 We have a sample chip.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_02
 One.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_02
 And then we have the sample speaker sensor for speech recognition.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_05
 One or two?

0:19:57	SPEAKER_05
 So the case, which one is it?

0:20:01	SPEAKER_02
 I think we will go for a single.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_04
 It is flat.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_04
 I thought you can curve it.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe there is a superman for that.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_00
 I think the price is this one.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_07
 Don't you?

0:20:30	SPEAKER_05
 I think we tried.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_05
 What is it?

0:20:38	SPEAKER_00
 That is expensive.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_05
 I think it is five.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_00
 You know why?

0:20:52	SPEAKER_00
 I think it is a special color.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_02
 There is no color here.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_00
 How many buttons?

0:21:10	SPEAKER_00
 Two.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_01
 Is there the score?

0:21:18	SPEAKER_02
 One.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_00
 This one.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_00
 That is not.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_00
 We choose this one and not this one.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_05
 I think no.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_00
 Is it a scroll wheel and pinch button?

0:21:46	SPEAKER_00
 How do you do to select?

0:21:53	SPEAKER_05
 You select with the other two buttons.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_00
 You go on the location with your screen.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_02
 Then you automatically, you can just do like if you go.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_02
 You have all of these.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_00
 She is very hard on this.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe not this one.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_05
 We have buttons.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_05
 Nothing special.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_00
 We are at 17.8.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_00
 The color is in the LCD.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_02
 I think we can just use this red.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_00
 It is already too expensive.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_05
 I am not ready.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_05
 I am always supposed to cut things out now until we get 12.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_00
 Think of what we can cut here.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_05
 If I look at what is the most expensive thing, it is the LCD and the speaker.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_00
 Apparently we have to choose one or the other.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_06
 As you may know, there is some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical energy.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_06
 The point is that when you take a device and push the button, you produce enough energy to make electricity.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_06
 It is something like hand dynamo, but a real high-tech version of it.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_00
 But it is like the hand dynamo.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe the jack wheel can be lit.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_05
 If we select the hand dynamo, it is okay.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_05
 We win one.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_06
 That is already there.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_00
 Let's do that.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_06
 I propose about cheaps, advanced, cheap on print.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_06
 Put minus one there.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_03
 That is illegal.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_00
 Let's try.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe minus three.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_02
 What is the result?

0:24:50	SPEAKER_05
 It is not changing.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe put minus two.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_04
 Is it not?

0:25:04	SPEAKER_07
 Anyway, the minus three.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_05
 Nobody will know.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_05
 It is not recorded.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_05
 We are on time.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_02
 We can increase the volume.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_00
 We can put hand dynamo on the battery.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_05
 Now we are exceeding.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_06
 Let's add one instead of two.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_02
 I think we are exceeding now.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_05
 It is better.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_05
 I think the accounting is maximum.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_05
 We will remove one of them.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_00
 We are on target.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_00
 Target reached.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_05
 I am curious to see this.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_00
 I would say it is Russian.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_05
 It is a Russian trick.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_00
 It is English.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_06
 It is a Russian trick.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_06
 I am not sure who was programming this.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_06
 I wonder if we put A or B somewhere.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_03
 Let's finish this.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_04
 We can discuss all these things in our party.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_00
 What else?

0:26:36	SPEAKER_04
 We have to make a self-assessment.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_05
 Are we a good team?

0:27:09	SPEAKER_05
 We have to listen to everybody.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_06
 Is there enough room for creativity?

0:27:24	SPEAKER_05
 When we see the results, no doubt.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe lack of leadership.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_03
 Teamwork is strong.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_05
 It means whiteboard digital pens.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_06
 What was good?

0:27:51	SPEAKER_04
 Digital pens useful.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_00
 We have to make a new idea.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_00
 So lack, but good.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_06
 We can play a good team.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_05
 It is somewhere in the shade.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_05
 We are on time.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_05
 We have to finish before.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_04
 We made a far meeting.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_05
 Not the best time.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_02
 We have a new idea, speech recognition, location, finding, new materials, new materials, new services, fancy strawberry design.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_00
 New ways of doing finance.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_05
 Just wondering if I can make the pinkness of that.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_00
 They are working on a pink titanium.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_02
 We are great.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_04
 No other words for that.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_04
 We are the best real reaction.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_00
 We are really nice.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_00
 Finish?

0:29:26	SPEAKER_00
 I think it is.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_05
 Are the cost we need the budget?

0:29:31	SPEAKER_02
 Is the project evaluated?

0:29:33	SPEAKER_05
 Yes, we got two.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_06
 We can even forecast all the day proposals, like celebration, we could forecast it.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_05
 To the whole company?

0:29:47	SPEAKER_05
 I am the one proposing the celebration.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_00
 I am the program manager.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_05
 Let's celebrate.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_07
 I think the meeting is over.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_02
 We have to.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_00
 We go to the party.

0:30:12	None
 Thank you.

0:30:15	None
 We are going to go to the party.

0:30:36	None
 We are going to go to the party.
