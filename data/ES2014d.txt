0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not seeing that.

0:00:03	SPEAKER_03
 I have to open it up last year.

0:00:08	SPEAKER_01
 I already exist.

0:00:11	SPEAKER_01
 Do you want the places to come up now?

0:00:18	SPEAKER_01
 I should try to transfer it to my documents, but...

0:00:22	SPEAKER_03
 I have to close that window because that's the save one.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_01
 I have to spread it.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_01
 I'll just redo it.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_01
 I'll just redo it.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_00
 I'll put a tight bedding in.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_00
 It's almost curved, like up to the main display as well.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_00
 The little line at the bottom in the middle is the panel that you pull down, and the extra flash of the buttons are below that panel.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_00
 The stick on the bottom is the company no more.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_02
 I have an apple slash chain at the top.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_03
 I'll just have my face.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_00
 It's a bit more fun as me.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_00
 It's not really a defender.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_00
 You think Apple, you can completely attack Apple?

0:01:58	SPEAKER_03
 We might get a copy right here.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_00
 It's a phone.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_02
 I'll ask the neat.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_00
 It might...

0:02:07	SPEAKER_00
 It'll probably have to be labeled.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_00
 I couldn't have anything smaller to try.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_02
 I would just choose simple shapes for all of them.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_00
 The important ones are the volume ones.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_00
 We'll move them a bit bigger.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_02
 We'll separate off and color the volume-related buttons from the channel-based buttons.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_02
 You've got the volume and volume shown pretty like that.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_01
 All these things have cost implications.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_01
 When I've done my thing on cost, I had assumed that the only button that would be a different color would be the red apple button.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_01
 However, I've never thought I could have said that.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, but there would be a cost implication on that.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_01
 I suppose that whether one of the colors would be open to debate.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_01
 I suppose.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_00
 What color would it be?

0:03:19	SPEAKER_00
 It wouldn't be too important, but we didn't have any white paper.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_01
 An important consideration.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_01
 Right, so the second one underneath would be the idea for the side-way.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_01
 Right, so we've got detailed design meeting.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_01
 So we've got prototype presentation, which we've just done.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_01
 Evaluation criteria and finance.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_01
 I guess we have to evaluate if that meets the various aspects that we're looking for from our previous meeting.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_01
 So other than the fact that it doesn't have the same layer, but obviously it would.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_01
 But other than that, we've got the red apple, we've got the buttons.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_01
 The only thing that's really changed is the coloration of the buttons.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_01
 But after the evaluation criteria is the finance.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_01
 And the cost allocation, the only scenario out this is that the cost is probably kind of important.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_01
 So, and then the production evaluation as to how easy that would be to manufacture.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_01
 And whether it would.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_03
 So if you had to do a presentation, we just become a prototype.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_01
 Right, so as far as the finance of it, whether you consider it, we would make sure that the cost, the production cost, because remember that was one of the first considerations, was to be in under 1250 or two and a half, 12 and a half euros.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_01
 So, there's no redesign.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_01
 So that should.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_01
 Right, so it seems to me that the thing that I have to do is.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_02
 Is quickly find that.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so by the fact that we've got.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_01
 Simple chip and the kinetic energy source.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_01
 We've got a single curved.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_01
 Case we've got a rubber.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_01
 Case materials supplements.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_01
 So we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_01
 But the button supplements well originally I thought there would just be one in there because it was the one red apple.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_01
 But so the so the real.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_01
 The real question that we come in.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_03
 Do you make all the buttons.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_01
 So we've got one special button for which was the apple everything else is going to be a standard.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_01
 We've got special material rubber wood titanium etc.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_01
 So I was originally I was thinking what rubber wasn't special but according to this maybe it is.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_01
 So.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_01
 And I mean effectively we've got 16 buttons that we're going to have on there.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think you just do one.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_01
 Is the sort of answer is that meant to be all 16 buttons and therefore.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_01
 I mean what's the up the option was maybe not to have rubber buttons.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_01
 But just to have the one that was.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_01
 Soft and spongy and therefore.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_01
 Whereas it would be the special color would be for the so you would only have the one special button that was rubber whereas the rest would be hard plastic.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_03
 I think the button supplements is just a supplement for all the buttons to be made in a different material.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_01
 Every design change is.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_01
 If we just had all the buttons as standard except for the one red apple then that would take care of that I guess.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 We'd have one special color and one special button for.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_01
 And when.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_01
 I plugged that in last time.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_01
 Remember it has to be under 12 and a half.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_01
 As far as I know that.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_01
 That took care of the of the various supplements.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_01
 And if who had.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_03
 It's on the bottom.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so but the point would be that if we.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_01
 If we just did special, sorry you were saying that it would be that one that you would put in one there.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_01
 So it was no it's 9.7 I've got.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so that would.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_01
 That would work out fine if.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_01
 Assuming your correction or assuming that one change covers all the buttons and that would be fine.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_02
 And there's nothing else as far as I can see that we would plan to.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_02
 And if we.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, that gives us 12.7.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_01
 But remember that the idea was to keep it the color of the.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_00
 So just take out the special color for the apple and.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_02
 And go for a battery instead that would give you one less.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_01
 You reckon that I mean the thing is that you wanted to appeal to people and.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_01
 Not have to replace batteries.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_02
 Assist this is the whole technology type thing.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_02
 You're saying in the market that people like to have interesting gadgets and.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_02
 Whether they were bigger.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_02
 The sample sensor the sample speaker.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_02
 Or its recognition to be sort of a worthwhile thing to have.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_02
 And it's not the batteries or whether they were not.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_02
 You know what I mean?

0:12:12	SPEAKER_02
 The problem was the battery running out and losing the.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_02
 Which do you think or which do we think.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_01
 Is the more important of the options in a sense of the moment we've got a total which we need to reduce down by 1.2.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_01
 At least remember that was a minimum requirement the other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_01
 Would be to.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_03
 Make it an originally we're going to make it simple.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_03
 Show you evaluate the prototype as we've got it now.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_03
 First.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_03
 And then to make decisions about what needs to be changed.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_03
 Makes sense.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_03
 Have a little thing.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_01
 Back up.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_03
 Presentation.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_01
 But remember the main the only reason we were planning on having device recognition was so that you could find the remote if it got lost.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_03
 This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the prototype we've got here.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_03
 So the method is that design team makes a prototype.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_03
 We evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we formulated.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_03
 And those ones are going to be in response to sort of market research.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_03
 And also finance.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_03
 I guess.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_03
 And do that on a scale from true being one.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_03
 A false being seven.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_03
 So it's now the June or false.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_03
 And that's four.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_03
 I've got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_03
 At the end.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_03
 We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_03
 Whether the product demonstrates technical innovation.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_03
 Whether it's easy to use.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_03
 Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion elements to try to fire.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_03
 And whether it's sort of recognizable real reaction product.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_03
 And if you go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently.

0:14:54	None
 So.

0:14:55	None
 I'll go up here.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_03
 So the first one is.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_03
 Does the product look and feel fancy?

0:15:09	SPEAKER_03
 So if you do this with one.

0:15:14	None
 So.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_02
 We have a single curve.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_02
 And maybe like the.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_02
 The other part is.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_02
 And we have the rubber kind of sponge.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_02
 At the time.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_02
 So that's some fancy.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_00
 So I'd really give it there.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_03
 I think what is one false or is one true.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_03
 I forgot.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_03
 One's true.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_03
 And okay.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_03
 Seven is full.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_03
 Four is neutral.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe two.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_00
 Because we haven't got the double curve.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_00
 So we'll call.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_00
 Go for one.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_00
 Almost everything.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_00
 I've got underneath.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_03
 So I've got some more space.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_03
 So false is seven.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_03
 True is one.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_03
 So say about two.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_01
 We're not maybe near three.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's just that.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_01
 I'm saying to me.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_01
 Remember that when you look down, we've got solar power.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_01
 But at various other things you could have.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_01
 And we're not going for these options.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_03
 This is just like the look.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_03
 Does it look fancy rather than functional?

0:16:41	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_03
 So should we go for a two on that?

0:16:51	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation?

0:16:57	SPEAKER_02
 We're deciding between the kinetic power or the speech recognition.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_02
 We had even those for our budget.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_03
 So what about the prototype as it is?

0:17:13	SPEAKER_03
 We've got the speech recognition on it.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_02
 We're not the kinetic.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_03
 But not the kinetic power.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_01
 No, because you can't afford that.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_01
 We're too bad out to.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_02
 We can't afford both.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_04
 Didn't know.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_03
 So it doesn't, it's pretty, the prototype as it is, isn't sort of fulfilling the...

0:17:36	SPEAKER_02
 No, no.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_02
 It's made by the choice.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_02
 It's got something that it has in that.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we're in it.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_01
 In 13.7, we do have kinetic.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_01
 The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to 12.5.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_01
 And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_01
 So it's very much dependent on what you do with your options.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_01
 And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker, then...

0:18:06	SPEAKER_01
 Because the other functions we've got in are more...

0:18:11	SPEAKER_01
 The special material, the rubber, wood titanium, et cetera.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_01
 If you go for that, that's at the high end because that's.6.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_01
 Whereas down it, just special color is.2.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_01
 And you're trying to lose 1.2.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_01
 So it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensor speaker, you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_01
 And the simple way to do it would be to have a battery, to have your sample sensor speaker.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_01
 And then you're looking to take out.2, which would be...

0:18:54	SPEAKER_01
 Come from the button supplements category.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just going to check exactly where it's said in the email for...

0:19:04	SPEAKER_00
 How much of the difference would it make if you made the case in plastic?

0:19:11	SPEAKER_00
 Because we did say that we don't want to follow the fashion too much.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_00
 But it's a rubber. That might be strange, you know.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_01
 So you could have an interface type, well, plastic rather than rubber.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_01
 That would make the cinema difference.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_01
 You could either... If you have it in plastic rather than rubber, then that would enable you to get.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_01
 You could keep kinetic then. You could keep your sample sensor.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_01
 You were looking to take out.2.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_01
 Or you could fiddle that down your special form at the bottom or your special colour at the bottom.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_01
 And that would enable you to do it.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_02
 So as soon as we make it slightly more fancy, then we use poison innovation.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_02
 If we make it more innovative, then we use poison.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_03
 I just read the email again and it sort of says, it's evaluated the design sort of as it is I think.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know whether we've done it in the wrong order or something.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 Well, okay.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_01
 But...

0:20:18	SPEAKER_00
 I suppose it's rubber as it is.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 It's rubber as it is, yes.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:20:23	SPEAKER_03
 I think this needs to go up a bit or something because we've got both the...

0:20:30	SPEAKER_01
 We've got... We've got 13.7 and we've got it in at the moment.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_01
 And basically we're going to reduce down from that.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_01
 But the current one you'd see would be fancy, would be two.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_03
 I'm for innovation.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_03
 So we've got the speech, the speech thing.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_03
 And...

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 I would have said about a two as well.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_00
 I'm happy to do that.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_03
 Now the next one is...

0:20:59	SPEAKER_03
 I'll have to get it back up now.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_03
 The next one...

0:21:03	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I can just sing about easy to use.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_01
 I would have said yes.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_01
 I would have said yes.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_01
 I would have go for a one on that at this point and two.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:11	None
 Okay.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I would say so as well.

0:21:14	None
 Okay.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I would say so as well.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_01
 And incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it certainly has some.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I thought the chat was...

0:21:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_03
 I thought it was three, maybe.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I'd say.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it was doing it quite well.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_02
 And we can have to do some of these for the moment as it's kind of...

0:21:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I would have said two would seem reasonable.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_01
 The products are recognizable, real...

0:21:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, reaction product.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_02
 The business has for using all of this...

0:21:51	SPEAKER_02
 All of this product, all of this money.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's got a pretty big label on the bottom saying...

0:21:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_03
...that's what it comes from.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_03
 So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_03
 And that sort of thing as well as having the logo on and all that.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_03
 So it's sort of...

0:22:08	SPEAKER_03
 Is it sort of a recognizable product?

0:22:12	SPEAKER_03
 Does it fit in with the art of other products which are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft?

0:22:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_00
 What's about the same speech?

0:22:22	SPEAKER_00
 Speech and the copyright issue?

0:22:25	SPEAKER_02
 As soon as it's kind of a sponge and roberiness is maybe the more kind of comfortable thing can sleep and...

0:22:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_02
 That's just what you like to do.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_01
 So we're going for...

0:22:38	SPEAKER_02
 Two...

0:22:40	SPEAKER_02
 Three...

0:22:42	SPEAKER_00
 Well, the logo would be more recognizable on the actual thing.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_00
 It's just that the pen wouldn't be right on that.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_00
 But I think the logo is definitely a recognizable and it does have...

0:22:56	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, it's that other product to do.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_04
 Three...

0:23:03	SPEAKER_01
 Two.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_01
 That's that decision.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:23:10	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_01
 So we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_01
 And then...

0:23:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_00
 What is...

0:23:19	SPEAKER_00
 What all of them does mean?

0:23:20	SPEAKER_00
 Do I add them up in the art style or anything?

0:23:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_03
 I think we sort of...

0:23:24	SPEAKER_03
 Add them up.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_03
 So sort of an average is going to be...

0:23:27	SPEAKER_01
 About a two.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_01
 Two.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_03
 One point eight, isn't it?

0:23:32	SPEAKER_03
 I think anyway.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_03
 So yeah, pretty close to two.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_03
 So I mean, it's pretty good at the moment, but it's going to get worse, isn't it?

0:23:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_03
 Try and make sure it doesn't get...

0:23:45	SPEAKER_01
 Two...

0:23:46	SPEAKER_02
 Two balance.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_02
 It's a 13.7.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_02
 It's a 13.7.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_02
 It's a 13.7.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_02
 It's a 13.7.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yep.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's a...

0:23:54	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you can lose 1.2.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_01
 And still meet.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_01
 Do you want to...

0:23:59	SPEAKER_01
 The requirement...

0:24:00	SPEAKER_03
 Get into your sort and get up there.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I put it back on.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_02
 I guess this is the last stage, but it's also about the final.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_03
 So we'll probably have to leave it there.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_01
 So we're not thought so.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe just...

0:24:17	SPEAKER_02
 See how it lays together.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_01
 So what was it?

0:24:20	SPEAKER_01
 Control...

0:24:21	SPEAKER_01
 F8, wasn't it?

0:24:22	SPEAKER_01
 It's a...

0:24:23	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 So you can see there that the...

0:24:31	SPEAKER_01
 If you want to keep kinetic, right, you've got a choice there.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_01
 Going down to battery, which would save you 1.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_01
 You've got...

0:24:40	SPEAKER_01
 The sample sensor and sample speaker, which is your big item.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_02
 Why should we just have a plastic case that we lose 2?

0:24:50	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_02
 Which gets us...

0:24:52	SPEAKER_02
 Which gets you...

0:24:56	SPEAKER_02
 Like within the budget range.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_00
 Because that was just a trend.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_00
 And we do have the rubber buttons anyway.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_02
 So that's the one.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_02
 And then we can make sure we definitely have all the buttons.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_03
 Different colours.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_03
 I was thinking that because maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of the sleek, simplistic case.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:21	None
 Okay.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_02
 Now we're going to have some more time for the innovations.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_02
 We lose a little bit on...

0:25:26	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe...

0:25:27	SPEAKER_01
 So we're going for plastic, yes?

0:25:29	SPEAKER_03
 We lose a little bit on the fashion, yeah.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_02
 And now we know that we have plastic that's within the budget.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_02
 Do we actually have...

0:25:39	SPEAKER_02
 Do we just have one special...

0:25:41	SPEAKER_02
 Only these special forms down here?

0:25:43	SPEAKER_01
 Well, there was debate as to how you would count them.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_01
 You got special colour.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_01
 Well, originally I was assuming we had the red apple and therefore that was the special colour.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think we should just imagine white buttons.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_02
 And we've got old buttons for another...

0:25:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_02
 We've got 0.8 lives, we've got a lot.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we've got special form.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_01
 Now that would be one button and the question was, was that all buttons or is that just one button?

0:26:06	SPEAKER_01
 Because our plan really was to have one button only with the special.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_01
 So no matter how you look at that, that would be the same.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_01
 The other thing would then be special material rubberwood titanium.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_02
 I think maybe the special colour we've got three now, just because of the volume buttons, the diff and I guess we have one more sharp blue at the moment.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_01
 Alright.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_01
 So a special colour you want three in there.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think we should...

0:26:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's probably fine for the plan.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_03
 You just need two for special colours because it's just two supplements.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, one original colour and then two supplements.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_03
 I think maybe.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_01
 That makes sense.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's probably it.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_03
 So we only need two for that.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_03
 These are molded, the one colour is going to be molded out of a piece of plastic rubberwood.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'd agree with that, I think.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_01
 So special colours too.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_01
 We've got special form.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_01
 Is the one apple, the rest are all standard although you could argue that should maybe be...

0:27:03	SPEAKER_01
 You were making these buttons down the bottom, I was presuming bigger than the other ones or were you.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_01
 Was that the idea?

0:27:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the only ones.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe that'd be a second step.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but it's a second special form.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_02
 Uh-huh.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_01
 I would have thought that's probably about...

0:27:18	SPEAKER_01
 There you go.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_01
 Wow.

0:27:20	None
 Okay, is that...

0:27:20	SPEAKER_01
 That's just the vehicle.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:27:23	None
 12.2 so we're still...

0:27:24	None
 We're in a genre.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:27:27	None
 That makes sense.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_02
 So we'd say we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fashion.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yep.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_02
 But Jim has been looking at the other rights piece.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_01
 I would have said so.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_01
 So you maybe put fashion...

0:27:51	SPEAKER_01
 Fashion at three rather than...

0:27:53	SPEAKER_01
 So should we do it?

0:27:54	SPEAKER_03
 Two.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it definitely fits the...

0:27:58	SPEAKER_02
 The real product.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_02
 Was it?

0:28:01	SPEAKER_02
 Was it really?

0:28:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_01
 Real reaction product.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not quite sure what it's happening.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it still seems that we've set that up so that's like a new age kind of...

0:28:14	SPEAKER_02
 In a...

0:28:15	SPEAKER_03
 In a...

0:28:16	SPEAKER_03
 In a...

0:28:17	SPEAKER_02
 In a...

0:28:18	SPEAKER_02
 In a...

0:28:19	SPEAKER_02
 In a...

0:28:20	SPEAKER_02
 In a...

0:28:21	SPEAKER_02
 In a...

0:28:22	SPEAKER_02
 In a...

0:28:23	SPEAKER_03
 In a...

0:28:24	SPEAKER_03
 In a...

0:28:25	SPEAKER_03
 In a...

0:28:26	SPEAKER_03
 In a...

0:28:27	SPEAKER_03
 In a...

0:28:28	SPEAKER_03
 In a...

0:28:29	SPEAKER_03
 In a...

0:28:30	SPEAKER_03
 In a...

0:28:31	SPEAKER_03
 In a...

0:28:32	SPEAKER_03
 In a...

0:28:33	SPEAKER_03
 In a...

0:28:34	SPEAKER_03
 In a...

0:28:35	SPEAKER_03
 In a...

0:28:36	SPEAKER_03
 In a bit of fashion.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe other ones could be...

0:28:38	SPEAKER_03
 Something else shaped.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know, that would be possible.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_03
 You can see those things as it's cheaper to make them a different series.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_03
 You know, we've made it a special form so...

0:28:46	SPEAKER_03
 And that would sort of...

0:28:48	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe keep us...

0:28:50	SPEAKER_03
 Close on the sort of fashion type one.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_03
 And it would sort of...

0:28:54	SPEAKER_03
 You know, keep it quite fancy as well.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_01
 You could argue you might do it once a year.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_01
 You would change.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_01
 Because at the moment you're making it a right apple.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_01
 right apple so next year you could make next year model the same but have it as a yeah whatever a lemon yeah a lemon lemon or something

0:29:12	SPEAKER_03
 yeah we got rid of we got rid of the plastic yeah we the main thing we've

0:29:26	SPEAKER_01
 changed really is the casing isn't it

0:29:28	SPEAKER_02
 yeah I think we've saved quite a bit so we've just got the pushburn interface which is might not achieve this yeah but maybe in a sense not having that maybe we lost something in the relation side you know and suppose that is like the most standard paper

0:29:48	SPEAKER_03
 back so we've got we've got rid of the rubber case but we've now we've now sort of got an extra form and an extra color for the buttons so maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability we're pretty much the same yeah maybe so maybe put two again

0:30:09	SPEAKER_02
 and everything else is stayed pretty much the same well ease is certainly stayed yeah because of anything the special

0:30:15	SPEAKER_03
 form is makes it slightly easier yeah yeah and what about the sort of innovation

0:30:20	SPEAKER_02
 we've still got the kinetic energy and the speech nature and then corporate identity I think we've got just by the same as maybe last as they it's hard to tell how the rubber

0:30:35	SPEAKER_03
 how we play out yeah whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity I don't know

0:30:45	SPEAKER_02
 it's maybe not I think more of the features of the actual control would be more important maybe than yeah either way I think we made it fairly close to what yeah okay

0:31:01	SPEAKER_00
 yeah do the whole thing in the kind of light but then what color would you like to ask

0:31:13	SPEAKER_02
 this is that maybe like that design issue

0:31:19	SPEAKER_01
 but you've got the company logo on there which would effectively be a stick on badge so you're in a sense you're comparing the product without the company logo and then but you've got the space for it to stick it on

0:31:31	SPEAKER_03
 what's the company color did you get told that the company color is

0:31:34	SPEAKER_02
 okay so you establish that I don't think so but but in the sense that as you saw

0:31:40	SPEAKER_01
 with the windows logo badge it doesn't really matter there's virtually the way that you frame you know the windows badge on there it really doesn't matter what color it is as long as our company's logo is framed in the same way as that with a like a black outline in fact they've got black and white or black and silver so basically even if you had a silver the same color of silver on your display because you've got effectively a double edging on the on the logo it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product and that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it

0:32:24	SPEAKER_03
 because you've got sort of got point to play with if you really wanted to

0:32:28	SPEAKER_01
 you could put in another another color well in this one you've actually got three colors of buttons yeah we decided that the blue ones were the the standard color okay so you were talking about we are assuming that all the buttons on the second panel the hidden away that would all be standard yeah yeah which

0:32:55	SPEAKER_03
 may or may not be the case yeah true save the point to the possibility

0:33:00	SPEAKER_01
 well yeah but but was it was not a button that you were thinking of on the on the other option you know on the second page as it were that you were thinking of maybe having is a different color

0:33:19	SPEAKER_00
 maybe for the the one that can see all the time

0:33:26	SPEAKER_02
 they make it look good and um hit the kind of idea of what they want and then for more functional buttons and it works much better it's like it puzzles hidden away anywhere in the theater stuff yeah right it's a sort of thing that

0:33:38	SPEAKER_03
 I mean you want to pick up the control and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume so if it's dead obvious then that's fine but if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning then you're paying a bit more attention so maybe sort of different color buttons isn't so important all right okay yeah so we just

0:33:57	SPEAKER_01
 add that to profitability and effect yeah I mean

0:33:59	SPEAKER_03
 you still drop the cost right so we're meant to finish up in five minutes same sort of function yeah criteria it's all right just made a load of money

0:34:22	SPEAKER_00
 shouldn't we maybe lose a point of fashion for this thing because we've lost the world because it doesn't seem right about it just hasn't changed at all

0:34:32	SPEAKER_03
 I think we said that because you got rid of the bubble we put an extra an extra sort of shape on one of the buttons well we could have lemon shaped ones for the volume

0:34:46	SPEAKER_02
 more of those things

0:35:05	SPEAKER_03
 did you have to have a rubber case though for rubber buttons or was it the way

0:35:09	SPEAKER_02
 around?

0:35:11	SPEAKER_01
 so we're okay this way around until the design team comes in and says get up but you are the design team so what better we on to

0:35:59	SPEAKER_00
 I can't just check if that's a cherry or an apple we would decide against the apple because of apple because of apple pie and then we'll make it a cherry for sure

0:36:08	SPEAKER_02
 oh right okay just in case we need that point two for

0:36:12	SPEAKER_01
Beats Oh, the rats have botched that all the time.

0:36:49	SPEAKER_00
 So, what we even put a certain target on that scale?

0:36:53	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, right, one vertical.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_03
 But it really has to fit into the budget, so...

0:37:00	SPEAKER_03
 I guess we just have to adjust things to get it in there.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_03
 Just try to?

0:37:07	SPEAKER_02
 And we seem to madly sum from each criteria.

0:37:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we haven't really left anything else, so...

0:37:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think.

0:37:15	SPEAKER_02
 I was nervous, probably, which has to be quite cheap.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_00
 So, do I have any help with this guy?

0:37:33	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know, it's only a chapter.

0:37:36	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_01
 Don't you?

0:37:46	SPEAKER_01
 No, what's on here?

0:37:50	None
 Okay.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_01
 All right, okay.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_01
 So, we've done the finance bit and the Excel project, and we've done the redesign, so we're now on to project process, satisfaction with, for example, room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, means accessibility, or a digital plan, etc.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_01
 So, we're actually now, in a sense, on to the evaluation of the course, rather than the evaluation of the project, as I'm understanding of it.

0:38:58	SPEAKER_01
 So, what did you...

0:39:00	SPEAKER_01
 And remembering that nobody's system of the curtain.

0:39:03	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:39:08	SPEAKER_03
 Finish on, please.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_02
 Which is good.

0:39:19	SPEAKER_01
 So, as I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down, which I will do.

0:39:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:39:27	SPEAKER_01
 So, I think I have to finish that page.

0:39:32	SPEAKER_01
 All right, okay.

0:39:33	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:39:42	SPEAKER_01
 So, creativity, do you feel you've got a chance to express yourselves well enough?

0:39:57	SPEAKER_03
 I've got some of the divisions there between sort of the individual meetings

0:40:02	SPEAKER_01
 with the arbitrary individual meeting. How do you do India?

0:40:07	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we were finding out various things in your own.

0:40:11	SPEAKER_03
 In between the meetings, and the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one.

0:40:17	SPEAKER_03
 So, things thrown in the second meeting where, you know, you've looked at the remote controls and seen the Coviness body.

0:40:25	SPEAKER_03
 And the first one you'd also look to some remote controls and look to the buttons.

0:40:30	SPEAKER_03
 And I don't understand why it would be a separate meeting.

0:40:33	SPEAKER_03
 But you'd do that, you know, you'd probably present it at one or something like that.

0:40:38	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the only thing you find is in a manufacturing process, you would normally go to a meeting, you'd say, right, you do this, you do that, you do that.

0:40:46	SPEAKER_01
 Then you go away, you find out information, you then come back, you then discuss it, you then go and change things around and then go back.

0:40:54	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:40:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, listen to your words, you'd be going out and finding more information this time.

0:40:58	SPEAKER_01
 Well, as this time you're really getting from a database or so, it's not...

0:41:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:41:02	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway, so what do you want to do?

0:41:06	SPEAKER_01
 I've proved seem dorky, creativity seemed dorky, flow of information on any given subject.

0:41:20	SPEAKER_01
 Given subject, sometimes disjointed.

0:41:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:41:29	SPEAKER_00
 I think it may be kind of been slightly more creative project, but the remote control isn't the most...

0:41:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, the thing is...

0:41:40	SPEAKER_00
 No, I was just like, how do you design it?

0:41:42	SPEAKER_00
 I can't think of a better example, I would...

0:41:45	SPEAKER_01
 I could have used a different example to increase...

0:41:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, is this creative?

0:41:58	SPEAKER_02
 Just a bit of something everyone knows about and then creativity, and then you can at least look at it.

0:42:04	SPEAKER_01
 You have to do it within a set timeframe as the other thing.

0:42:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:42:08	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I always think it's a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control.

0:42:13	SPEAKER_03
 It depends on the business you're in, I guess.

0:42:16	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, this one seems to have won.

0:42:18	SPEAKER_03
 On the website it looks quite innovative, but we're coming out with some bookish shop products, don't we?

0:42:25	SPEAKER_03
 That's the same thing.

0:42:26	SPEAKER_02
 It's a deep grid.

0:42:27	SPEAKER_02
 It's not like a range of products.

0:42:30	SPEAKER_02
 I think...

0:42:32	SPEAKER_02
 I guess this is going to sign out in the like a piece.

0:42:34	SPEAKER_01
 But the other thing is that, I mean, I'm guessing that they're trying to use this software to demonstrate how you could do a project.

0:42:49	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, my wife at the moment, for instance, is acting as a computer for...

0:42:58	SPEAKER_01
 Normally, you've got a problem, so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed.

0:43:05	SPEAKER_01
 So what she's doing is she's having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can ask whatever question.

0:43:17	SPEAKER_01
 And then you are the idea is that the whichever persons at the other end can point them in the right direction, and should have either give them directly, give them help, or secondly point them in the right direction, either at the library or come back or go and see job logs or whatever.

0:43:39	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:43:40	SPEAKER_01
 And that was a project I suspect similar to this, because they were actually trying to debug the computer software to enable it to work.

0:43:53	SPEAKER_01
 And of course, you had machine crashing and various things going from...

0:43:59	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:44:00	SPEAKER_01
 All right, so we've got...

0:44:03	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, if you look at their products on their website here, real reaction, it's all pretty high tech cutting edge.

0:44:12	SPEAKER_01
 You ideas found? Did we find any? No.

0:44:15	SPEAKER_02
 So, how do I do with this, the whiteboard, how the non-digital pen is placed?

0:44:19	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:44:20	SPEAKER_01
 Leadership.

0:44:21	SPEAKER_01
 Teamwork.

0:44:22	SPEAKER_03
 So we did find any idea, means, the kinetic remote control.

0:44:26	SPEAKER_03
 I don't see one of them before.

0:44:28	SPEAKER_03
 They're all batteries I think.

0:44:29	SPEAKER_02
 All voice recognition, especially not one with...

0:44:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:44:33	SPEAKER_01
 You've got voice recognition computers.

0:44:35	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it's not remote control.

0:44:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:44:38	SPEAKER_00
 What's a different application there?

0:44:40	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:44:41	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:44:42	SPEAKER_02
 And it's just like the same products, but it's put together in a different one.

0:44:45	SPEAKER_01
 So, how do you reckon teamwork went?

0:44:48	SPEAKER_03
 I would have, okay.

0:44:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I guess we all had such ideas.

0:44:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:44:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:44:55	SPEAKER_01
 Two, er, go...

0:45:01	SPEAKER_01
 Reason, I'm playing...

0:45:04	SPEAKER_01
 Well, okay.

0:45:06	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think sort of the putchet...

0:45:10	SPEAKER_03
...um...

0:45:11	SPEAKER_03
...allow just to do anything.

0:45:12	SPEAKER_01
 But arboring?

0:45:13	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I mean, I don't think it...

0:45:15	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products.

0:45:18	SPEAKER_03
 I've got all these sort of high definition DVD and portable seven inch lightweight computer screens.

0:45:29	SPEAKER_03
 I think one cheap remote control does really fit in.

0:45:33	SPEAKER_01
 So, we're meant to comment on leadership and means E.G. Whiteboard, digital pens, et cetera.

0:45:42	SPEAKER_01
 And new ideas found was the other thing.

0:45:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:45:49	SPEAKER_00
 We can't really...

0:45:52	SPEAKER_00
...all fail to comment on leadership because we want to project manage our new...

0:45:57	SPEAKER_00
...so our experience in leadership wasn't really as much as yours.

0:46:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:46:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:46:05	SPEAKER_01
 Now, I'm much more...

0:46:06	SPEAKER_01
...filling like it.

0:46:08	SPEAKER_01
 But...

0:46:09	SPEAKER_01
...I certainly didn't get this computer to work as well as I would have liked.

0:46:17	SPEAKER_01
 However...

0:46:18	SPEAKER_01
...right, means so Whiteboard, so really it's equipment.

0:46:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:46:25	SPEAKER_03
 It worked.

0:46:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it worked.

0:46:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it worked.

0:46:29	SPEAKER_03
 It could be a bit difficult at times.

0:46:32	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I don't...

0:46:37	SPEAKER_00
...I'm not sure I see the value in these.

0:46:40	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, they record what you write in and then what to do with it.

0:46:43	SPEAKER_00
 Where do you get the recording?

0:46:45	SPEAKER_00
 Do you...

0:46:46	SPEAKER_00
...computers or something?

0:46:47	SPEAKER_03
 It's a little...

0:46:48	SPEAKER_02
...it's not just for us, it's for these families.

0:46:51	SPEAKER_03
 It's a little chip I think you're just plugging into something else.

0:46:55	SPEAKER_00
 It's like...

0:46:56	SPEAKER_00
...producer.

0:46:57	SPEAKER_00
...producer.

0:46:58	SPEAKER_00
...producer.

0:46:59	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:47:00	SPEAKER_03
 I've produced the game, so everything you've written or something.

0:47:03	SPEAKER_03
 No, you have to pay.

0:47:04	SPEAKER_01
 New ideas found, so one or two?

0:47:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:47:08	SPEAKER_03
 Kinetic powered remote control.

0:47:11	SPEAKER_03
 What was it, the one?

0:47:14	SPEAKER_00
 Voice.

0:47:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:47:16	SPEAKER_00
 What was your thing?

0:47:18	None
 Right, word.

0:47:21	None
 And...

0:47:24	SPEAKER_01
...voice.

0:47:29	SPEAKER_01
...voice.

0:47:31	SPEAKER_01
 With a voice activated.

0:47:33	SPEAKER_03
 Voice recognition.

0:47:35	SPEAKER_03
...reconation.

0:47:36	SPEAKER_03
...almost.

0:47:44	SPEAKER_03
...in this...

0:47:46	SPEAKER_01
...

0:47:59	SPEAKER_01
...in this summary of any celebration?

0:48:01	SPEAKER_01
 That's good.

0:48:03	SPEAKER_03
 I think that you've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting.

0:48:10	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:48:13	SPEAKER_01
...we don't...

0:48:16	SPEAKER_01
...so really...

0:48:19	SPEAKER_01
 I tried to save this last time at 12.3 and it doesn't seem to have saved anywhere.

0:48:25	SPEAKER_01
 Mind you, the figure last time was different, but...

0:48:30	SPEAKER_01
...it should be both.
