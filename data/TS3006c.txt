0:02:57	SPEAKER_03
 Ja, here we go again. Welcome.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_03
 You have again tree presentations, and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to further remote control has to sport.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_03
 So, let's go.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yes. Who wants to start?

0:03:17	SPEAKER_04
 Me first again or?

0:03:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_04
 Does me.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_04
 Very nice to meet you.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_04
 Can anyone visit a private app?

0:03:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:03:41	None
 Hello.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_04
 Hello.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_04
 Did you hear the request given?

0:03:52	SPEAKER_04

0:04:21	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, well, this is the fruit and vegetables.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_04
 Looks are fresh, bright colors.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_04
 So to give you an ID.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_04
 Well, the developments, development 1.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_04
 Well, the most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look and feel.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_04
 Instead of the current functional look and feel.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_04
 Well, fancy stands for an original look and feel of the case and the interface.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_04
 And the second most important aspect is that the remote control should be technological, innovative.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_04
 I think we pretty much cover that with our screen and speed recognition.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_04
 So I don't expect that to be a problem.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_04
 The third development is that the remote control should be easy to use.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_04
 Well, the first aspect was twice as important as the second aspect, which was twice as important as the third aspect.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_04
 So that kind of gives you these ratios.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_04
 So fancy look and feel is the most important point of attention.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_04
 So the fruit and vegetables in combination with the sponsor material.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_04
 Well, technological innovation.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_04
 We cover that pretty much, I guess.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_04
 And easy to use.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think that would be a problem.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_04
 So my point of attention is especially this part that this will be correct.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_04
 So that was the marketing presentation.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_04
 I had only one document left.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_01
 Did you like the first?

0:06:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, no, I don't mind.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_04
 So kind of this.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_04
 So a small example, kind of this, nothing about the buttons, but just sponge kind of thing and some fruit and colors.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_04
 Just made a quick design.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_03
 Cool.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_03
 I think growing.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_03
 OK, you're just using the same.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_02
 Copartus.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, layout.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_02
 What now?

0:06:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_03
 It's OK.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_03
 You probably opened it.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, true.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_02
 F5.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_02
 F5.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_02
 So I'm dealing with the component design.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_02
 Let's see.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_02
 I used some design examples we had from similar products.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_02
 And I used possibilities for our manufacturing department about current components, which will have to be implemented in the design.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_02
 That's why I had to go first.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_02
 Well, they gave me an idea about what people want.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_02
 We're mainly focusing on this group, but I want to make the distinction clear.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_02
 I could not drag the pictures into the slide source.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_02
 So I don't have examples of how it looks like.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_02
 But it comes down to what you think we should do with the spongy and the fruity-looking type.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_02
 If the young dynamic people want soft primary colors, which look like fruits, you know, you can and shapes that are curved and not saw it straight-lined anymore.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_02
 So this basically goes on to what you were mentioning earlier.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_02
 There's a lot of factors involved in choosing the components.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_02
 There's a lot of options that we have to discuss.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_02
 For example, the energy source.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_02
 We have four types.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_02
 The basic battery.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_02
 We have a hand dynamo, which we do not refer to it as the Knife God.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_02
 The kinetic provision of energy, which means if you move the thing, if you shake it, which will be fun for toddlers, right?

0:08:21	SPEAKER_02
 If they want to use the.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_02
 And of course, so are ourselves.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_02
 But I don't know how we would use that into the design of the actual product.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_02
 So indoors.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, also in countries where it isn't much light, like in Scandinavia, they wouldn't be able to use it half of the year, you know?

0:08:41	SPEAKER_02
 So that's not cool either.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_02
 So for the case, there's the traditional uncarved flat hard case, single curved, which means that it has curves in one dimension or the double curves.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_02
 I wasn't able to finish my personal preferences sheet, but well, you know, we will have to go for the double curved because it's daring and different from what we have now.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_02
 The case materials.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we have all kinds of hard materials, like the hard plastic, the wood and the titanium.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_02
 I would definitely go for rubber because it fits most in what people want to see nowadays.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_02
 Poof.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_02
 This is a lot of text.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_02
 I wasn't able to organize this yet.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_02
 We have several interface designs.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_02
 We can use scroll buttons for the menus.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_02
 But we already kind of decided to go for the push buttons for the arrow buttons.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_02
 So that's not really interesting.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_02
 Electronics.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we want to decide on what electronics to use.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_02
 The advanced chip, I think, is easiest to implement for the production because they can print it better.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_02
 I think this is about it.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_02
 I was working on some personal preferences.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_02
 I first chose for the battery because, yeah, I'm traditional.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_02
 And that's the most obvious easiest choice to go to.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_02
 But I really think that we should maybe think about the kinetic energy where we have to move the thing to be able to use it.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_01
 The additional feature.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_01
 Or combine both with one source of energy.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_02
 I can imagine that the kinetic type energy source would be more expensive to make.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_02
 But it is more long-lasting that people don't have to ever buy batteries again.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_04
 That is more fun.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_02
 And it's also more fun.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_02
 I always chuck my remote control around.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_04
 So just playing with it.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_04
 And especially when the material is rubber, it can be done.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, you can't harm it.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_02
 So it's a perfect combination.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_02
 You don't have to be scared about bands get off the floor and breaking it or whatever.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_02
 So that's the end of it.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_02
 So go ahead.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_04
 So double-carves is like this.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_02
 No, it means curved in two dimensions.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_02
 So a single curved would be a square box.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_02
 But then with curves on one dimension, and double-curved would mean that it would have curves in the eyes.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_01
 Every direction looks really good.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_01
 One very important thing I was thinking about is the speech option.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_01
 We were going to use that.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_01
 So that's one thing, which I'm not sure of how to implement it into the design.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the visual representation is not there with speech.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_01
 It has to be combined with a menu for functions.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_03
 So I think you can just match the speech commands with the functions that are already present.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we don't think you have to design anything.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_01
 And do the speech just for the basic options for the simple buttons for everything, also for the funds options.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, this is our very basic trend design.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_01
 Everybody says it.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_01
 So that's what's.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_01
 In the last meeting, we were putting the simple and the advanced options separated.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_01
 It's obvious.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, pressing the menu option will disable all other options on your remote control.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 And only the LCD panel will light up.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_01
 And then you can only change the buttons that you need to control.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_01
 I guess.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, design has to be very attractive with that.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_01
 You're hoping for it.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_01
 You have to do this.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_01
 But this is the simple layout display on the upper side with the menu button and maybe some sort of cancel button or save button.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_01
 That would be the back.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_01
 Back and OK.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_01
 Back and OK.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_03
 You did read the minutes, I wrote.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_03
 You did read the minutes, I wrote.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 A little bit, I think, but not necessarily.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_03
 Because I pretty much summed up all the buttons there.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 So I didn't read that.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_03
 I hate doing work for nothing.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_01
 But this is the basic design for the buttons.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_01
 I wanted to categorize everything with speech, display, sound, everything.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_01
 You know that in your minutes.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_01
 Every push button has its own lead light.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_01
 So you can make it more trendy for younger people.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_01
 And if there are older people, they want it more luxurious.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_01
 So that's also an option.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_01
 That was it.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_03
 That was it.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_03
 And I'm again.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_03
 So what do we have to do side is what kind of components do we use?

0:15:00	SPEAKER_03
 Energy source, chip type, case type, and user interface.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_03
 But I didn't see a clear distinction between this.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_03
 So I think what we have is OK.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_03
 So we only, we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_03
 The case would be doubly curved.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_03
 Rubber material.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_03
 Rubber material.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_03
 And that's the only thing we have left.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we need the chip on print to be able to support the screen and.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_02
 Now it's easy.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_02
 Audio function.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_04
 So is that he advanced?

0:15:36	SPEAKER_04
 Chip?

0:15:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_02
 Otherwise, you would have a simple chip just for pressing it.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_02
 But we need more.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_02
 I'm just thinking this is not my department, but I'm not sure what this is going to cost to be able to.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't get any info this.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 Because we need to sell it for 25 euro a piece.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_04
 It's going to be difficult, huh?

0:15:57	SPEAKER_04
 The cost of making it should be 12 and a half.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't get any information about that.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_01
 I don't produce it in China, so it's not problem.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_02
 Child labor, man.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_02
 We love it.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so it doesn't.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_03
 Let's see the new thing.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_04
 Well, the interface type.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the interface.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's quite difficult because we haven't got all the options.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_03
 Do you have a picture of doubly curved case?

0:16:32	SPEAKER_03
 Can you put it in the group folder?

0:16:34	SPEAKER_02
 Let me see.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_02
 Let me see.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_04
 What is that?

0:16:37	SPEAKER_04
 If you go to your home page or something.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going there now.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_04
 Get your own information.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_04
 Inspiration.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_04
 I got my fresh and fruity picture.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_04
 Also, there.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_04
 Well, you didn't draw it yourself.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_04
 Too last time.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it's the menu.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that was the menu I was looking at.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, maybe it's easier with an arrow.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_04
 So that indicates that there's a menu under that menu.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, perfect.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_03
 So that's cool.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it's easier if you guys come over here.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_02
 See, this is the standard traditional type where the forum serves the function.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_02
 It's really basic, but this is more appealing to old people.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_02
 And we don't want that.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_02
 This is what we're looking for.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_02
 And that means curved in both dimensions.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_02
 Not only like this, but it has to be...

0:17:40	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_02
 It has to be kind of instead of the PlayStation module, it has to be like the GameCube, you know, where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument, and it has to be nice to hold.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_01
 It has also to be luxurious for rich people.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_01
 This looks a little bit like an ownership children.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but that's the problem.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the dilemma, actually, because we want to appeal to the young public with flashy colors and with a lot of shape.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_02
 And the rubber, it will look cheap always, you know, with...

0:18:20	SPEAKER_01
 With the colors you can make it, make the colors with the lets beneath the buttons.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_01
 If you press the button and you can disable the core and lets for people that don't like it.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_02
 There is mobile phones in which you can change the color also of the lights.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we should consider this function to customize it.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_02
 And so, I mean, kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colors.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_02
 And people want something different, or more design.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_02
 They can go for one color.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_02
 For example, this photo camera.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_04
 Cool, underwater.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_02
 Personally, I think it's really ugly.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_02
 Just give me the thing that it's inside there, but yeah, then maybe I'm too old for this stuff.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. So, I think are all...

0:19:19	SPEAKER_03
 I am bright colors.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_02
 This is with the curve that I mean.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_03
 That's singly curve.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_04
 Which would be nice.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_03
 We could make compromise between that, but I don't know if we're with the effort.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_02
 You compromise between what?

0:19:38	SPEAKER_03
 Instead of doubly curve, we take a single curve.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_02
 So, this will be a single curve.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, this is only in this dimension.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_04
 Like this.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_04
 So, curve here.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_04
 Not in the eyes.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_04
 Exactly.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_04
 So, we keep it singly, single curve then.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_03
 That would be an option, I don't know what you think.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_02
 I think that...

0:20:00	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, our aim is to make something different, right?

0:20:03	SPEAKER_02
 To make something new.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_02
 I would go for the double curve.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_02
 I'm thinking, you know, a drawing palette where you have the shape for your thumb.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_02
 So, it kind of holds nicely something like that.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_01
 Well, this is really your decision.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_01
 We can make more options for buttons if you have it in your hand.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_01
 You are not only...

0:20:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you don't need to want the dimension, but you can use other dimensions for pressing the buttons.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, as well.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_02
 You can make a trigger button or something like that.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, or that is the confirmation button or something.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_02
 That you scroll with your thumb, with the arrows, and then confirm.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_02
 That would be a nice way to use it.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_02
 But, I mean, yeah, I'm thinking big already and we need something...

0:20:53	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that you can able to use in one hand, I think.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_04
 So, from top view looks kind of like this, but from the side, you can have it also in a kind of shape.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe because the screen is on top, you can have buttons to interface.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe you can have this kind of shape, a little upwards, so that the screen is more towards yourself, so you can easily see your screen.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_04
 How about you have it in your hand?

0:21:28	SPEAKER_04
 So, it's kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_04
 So, then you have double...

0:21:33	SPEAKER_04
 Double curves in some way.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_04
 So, this is...

0:21:36	SPEAKER_04
 This is...

0:21:37	SPEAKER_04
 So, the screen is positioned over here.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, something like that.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_04
 And the buttons are more...

0:21:44	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, it's very thick now, but...

0:21:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, understand what you mean.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_02
 Let's...

0:21:50	SPEAKER_02
 How about we do a pop-up screen like the laptop?

0:21:55	SPEAKER_02
 So, that only the simple functions will be feasible at first.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that you can...

0:22:01	SPEAKER_02
 If you want.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_02
 And then it comes up or...

0:22:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, something like that.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_03
 So, you have the side view?

0:22:08	SPEAKER_04
 But then the side view can be straight if you have a pop-up screen.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_04
 But I don't know if that's too expensive.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I want to be able to...

0:22:18	SPEAKER_03
 Like this.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_02
 No, like I would draw it like this.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_02
 Let's say this is the side view that you have a screen that will come up here and can go down that way.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_02
 You know what I mean.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_02
 So, that it will come up like that.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so the buttons are on top here and you flip it over that...

0:22:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, or preferably even keep the simple buttons here.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_02
 And then under the screen even...

0:22:48	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, the other one.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_01
 More advanced buttons.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's good.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_01
 More advanced options for the menu.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_01
 For the LCD menu.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's not all because you need most of them, the error buttons, but you can hide the okay in the back and the menu button also because when you flip it over and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will activate the mode automatically.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_02
 Activate the...

0:23:19	SPEAKER_04
 So, okay, but you need some button to flip this.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_04
 Right, you choose to make it mechanically.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_02
 But you can make a trigger here.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and it says menu when it flips open

0:23:32	SPEAKER_04
 and then you have the buttons to control the combination with your...

0:23:36	SPEAKER_01
 It's not very strong. If you drop it one time...

0:23:40	SPEAKER_04
 True, it can go open.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the idea of it was...

0:23:44	SPEAKER_02
 Because you close it, you cover the LCD screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_04
 And it will be covered in some kind of thin rubber layer.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly, exactly.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_02
 We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_02
 No, it's very solid.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that may work.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_02
 That actually will offer some extra protection.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, but then we still have the thing of the shape.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I was thinking if you have your hand, if this is your...

0:24:14	SPEAKER_00
 Harder.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, the lower part doesn't work, I guess, so maybe you should try it over there.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_02
 If this is your thumb and this is your hand like that...

0:24:25	SPEAKER_02
 With your wrist...

0:24:27	SPEAKER_02
 That it would be kind of shaped like this, you know?

0:24:32	SPEAKER_02
 So, it's easier to hold in your hand to...

0:24:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_01
 Left hand, that's a problem.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, of course.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_02
 Then you would have to...

0:24:42	SPEAKER_02
 To make it like this, like you drew here.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_02
 And maybe then make this thicker also than the center, give it...

0:24:52	SPEAKER_02
 I would give it a female shape, but yeah.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_03
 If you will shape it, if too...

0:24:57	SPEAKER_03
 Obviously.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_01
 It could make some more appealing to guys.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_01
 Which you can change.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but that's optional for later, I guess.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but we have hardware inside, which is...

0:25:16	SPEAKER_02
 So it has to have some sort of basic shape.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we better...

0:25:20	SPEAKER_02
 And also the screen, you can unmold it.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, so, okay, we should better choose one shape.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_04
 But that's kind of the idea, so it lays good in the hand.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_02
 And then on the side with your thumb...

0:25:31	SPEAKER_04
 It lays the screen here, where you can...

0:25:33	SPEAKER_04
 You can use the button.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_03
 So the key options are primary colors.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_02
 And then I would...

0:25:40	SPEAKER_02
 Spongebob.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_02
 I would do the arrows here, kind of thing.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_02
 Spongebob can be raised by himself.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_02
 And the simple buttons here.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_04
 And the control things in the middle, the arrows?

0:25:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's what I mean, the arrows over here.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and here the numbers.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_04
 Simple, okay.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's a nice design.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_03
 Pretty nice design.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_04
 That's cool.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that looks pretty fancy.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_02
 Or do we want to make a shape look like a banana or something?

0:26:11	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, this.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_04
 Bananas are weird shape and other fruits also.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_04
 It's better to have some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary colors.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know what colors should the basic print be like.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_04
 Some soft green or something or...

0:26:31	SPEAKER_01
 And then...

0:26:32	SPEAKER_01
 Or a dark blue or...

0:26:33	SPEAKER_04
 Oh yeah, dark blue.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_04
 And then...

0:26:35	SPEAKER_04
 Should use...

0:26:36	SPEAKER_04
 And then very bright yellow banana or an orange, green apple, stuff like that.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_04
 It's very bright tones, I guess.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we need very primary colors, like bright red, bright yellow.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but primary colors we can create with the LEDs on the...

0:26:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay, yeah.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_01
 If you make it just...

0:26:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, give it the blue color, then it's just a neutral color, also for the more...

0:27:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, for the older people.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_04
 That doesn't really work to draw.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_04
 I guess.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, what's this?

0:27:12	SPEAKER_03
 This text.

0:27:13	None
 Right.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, you have text.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_03
 You can also make a line this.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, two hours further.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, thickness.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_01
 And that's blue.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_04
 Why not go for the 20?

0:27:34	None
 Yeah.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_04
 That's what I call painting.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_04
 So that's a dark blue basic color, I guess.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it is pretty nice.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_04
 And then...

0:27:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, with some yellow banana...

0:27:50	SPEAKER_04
 And how about some flashing stand by lights?

0:27:55	SPEAKER_02
 Like you have on the Samsung, well, I don't like to call brand phones.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_02
 Because I remember from one of our first meetings that people lose their remote controls often.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_02
 So not only in the colors of the LEDs that we want something to keep it feasible at all times.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_04
 But...

0:28:20	SPEAKER_04
 How do you mean?

0:28:22	SPEAKER_03
 Some of the flashing colors, so you can't lose it.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, exactly.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's a bit too much.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, an orange.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_04
 Well, this is more like purple, I guess.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_04
 It should be more real dark blue.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_04
 So the contrast with the fruit of Jackson is pretty high.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_04
 So, yeah, this would be a nice device, I guess.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_01
 So, the color shoots and should I give that display?

0:28:52	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, the color of the background of this display.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I don't guess it has to be...

0:28:58	SPEAKER_04
 60...

0:29:00	SPEAKER_04
...65,000 colors.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, too expensive.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_04
 So, just a blue, blue backlight or something like that.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_04
 Green is too old-fashioned, but blue.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_02
 As long as you use high contrast between the background and the foreground color.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_01
 So, that people with...

0:29:20	SPEAKER_01
 White backlight?

0:29:22	SPEAKER_04
 White backlight and dark.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_01
 Dark letters.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_04
 Whatever, which is visible.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_04
 I know you should test it under a light condition, I mean, it's hard to tell.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_02
 And also for people who are a bit color blind.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's obviously red and green, I believe.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_04
 Which colors should the buttons be?

0:29:45	SPEAKER_01
 That's adjustable.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_04
 Whoa.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_04
 White just...

0:29:49	SPEAKER_04
 All buttons?

0:29:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_04
 No, no.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_01
 That's how we are going to make it a more trendy.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_01
 What?

0:29:58	SPEAKER_01
 Or is that too expensive?

0:29:59	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe, I mean, they have to...

0:30:01	SPEAKER_04
 They have to have some color, right?

0:30:03	SPEAKER_04
 And if the background is very dark blue.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe green.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we want to make the background the bright colors.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_02
 So, the total thing is very bright.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_02
 Like the pictures I showed you guys.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_02
 Those things were all bright red, red, red, flashy.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_04
 So, more like...

0:30:25	SPEAKER_04
 Doesn't work.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_04
 Very well.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_04
 More like this color.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, something like that, something like that.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_02
 And then...

0:30:32	SPEAKER_04
 Then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_04
 But then again, which colors should the buttons be?

0:30:40	SPEAKER_04
 The press buttons.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_04
 Should they be white or black or...

0:30:44	SPEAKER_01
 Right, maybe.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_01
 And it looks quite cheap.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_01
 That's color, I think.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_04
 The green?

0:30:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but it's pretty fresh on the other side.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's actually pretty trendy color at the moment.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_04
 It's trendy, I think.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_04
 My couch is in that color.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_03
 Ooh, this is a couch.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_04
 Well, that works pretty well.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_04
 And then time was up.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_03
 Right, don't you?

0:31:12	SPEAKER_02
 Do you get a pop-up?

0:31:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, within five minutes.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_03
 That you have five minutes left or...

0:31:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, left and then...

0:31:19	SPEAKER_03
 Let's kick you out.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_04
 So, something like this.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_04
 That should be pretty nice color.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_04
 But maybe the buttons...

0:31:25	SPEAKER_04
 All buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colorblind people.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_01
 No, this is red or green.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_01
 But the buttons had their own lads or not.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the red and green are actually the easiest to discriminate.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_02
 Even for colorblind.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_02
 They will see one of each as gray.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_02
 But if you use green on blue, those kind of colors will look the same.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_04
 So red buttons are okay.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_01
 I think so.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, that gets the default setting the red buttons.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I think you need to keep in mind that the lads are just extra light.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_04
 How do you mean?

0:32:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_03
 They don't determine the color.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, yeah.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_01
 That much, I think.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_01
 I think about the red lads and blue lads and blue...

0:32:17	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that's too busy, I guess.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_03
 You have a background.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_03
 Each number is transparent.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_03
 Partly, but you have to print on the number or the sign.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_03
 So he comes...

0:32:28	SPEAKER_03
 You better...

0:32:29	SPEAKER_04
 You better keep the lads and the buttons itself in the same color, I guess.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_04
 So just an extra bit of light inside the deck.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_04
 You can...

0:32:40	SPEAKER_02
 What we should do is make kind of a see through plastic buttons with one color the lads behind it.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_02
 So that the whole button will shine as the color...

0:32:53	SPEAKER_02
 And if you think about easy to use buttons, we have to...

0:33:01	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold for both hands, but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_03
 If you hold the machine.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_03
 Don't mean to discourage you.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_03
 Basically, you two are going to work on Smartboard next 30 minutes to design the design.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_03
 Alright.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_03
 Alright.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_03
 And you will do the evaluation of the product, which we don't have yet.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, about.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_04
 So, how should I do that?

0:33:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_04
 Or you send it to me.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_03
 Because you are going to design it on this board, right?

0:33:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but maybe you can do the evaluation.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_03
 You don't have to evaluate yet, but you can make a procedure which you follow.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I probably get instructions that have to do that.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_04
 So I make another presentation, I guess.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_04
 I know what's going to happen in life.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so...

0:34:06	SPEAKER_03
 You have a basic ID.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_03
 And you two are going to do this.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_03
 So we're going to work here on this sketchboard.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_02
 Alright.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_02
 Thanks.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_04
 Alright, so that's where...

0:34:20	SPEAKER_03
 I just just make a new page and be creative.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_01
 Alright.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_01
 So you have to do it at this moment after?

0:34:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you have 30 minutes.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_03
 Then we have to see something.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_01
 So we have to show to the management.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_02
 What we are thinking about.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_02
 So we make a new...

0:34:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_02
 That's just a debate on this.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_02
 Or...

0:34:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, just...

0:34:51	SPEAKER_02
 Alright.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_03
 Make a new one.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_02
 Alright.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_02
 Save this board.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_03
 I'll just keep it there.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_03
 Just press save.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_04
 It'll be fine.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_04
 On the left.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, sorry.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_03
 You can also use the clip art.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_02
 That's your color.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_02
 Draw in paint or something.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_02
 So we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_01
 Because...

0:35:26	SPEAKER_01
 That we can make the user on the grid.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, because I have to focus on the basic look and field design.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_02
 So how it's going to look.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_02
 And you have to think how we're going to put the screen in it and those kind of things.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_02
 So if I'm drawing and you think, okay, I'm not going to be able to put a screen in there.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_02
 I guess I have to put a screen in there.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_02
 Do you mind if I draw in black then for normal sketches?

0:35:48	SPEAKER_04
 I don't need buttons.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_04
 I use your lines.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_02
 I use my words.

0:35:51	SPEAKER_02
 So we kind of want the colors.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_04
 So the plastic buttons also help.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_04
 Because of their only...

0:36:02	SPEAKER_04
 How much are good at drawing?

0:36:03	SPEAKER_04
 During interaction.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_02
 Excuse me?

0:36:06	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it's a good thing that the buttons aren't...

0:36:10	SPEAKER_04
 Well, that they are plastic because then you can light up the light on grid when they are usable.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe you should draw it very large like this.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, this part isn't functioning.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_02
 How do we erase?

0:36:28	SPEAKER_02
 Now, or insert text?

0:36:34	SPEAKER_03
 I know, maybe just start typing.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_01
 But that's a bit big, yeah.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_03
 You also do the other sides, not only in the front side.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, exactly.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_03
 Side view.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_01
 Let's make first the other views.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_01
 The front view, side view.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_02
 I thought for the side view that the base exception would be rather...

0:37:08	SPEAKER_02
 A bit thicker than the middle where you're holding it, because your fingers have to fit underneath.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_02
 You know, it has to be very small.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_04
 But then you assign it the meeting is over.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly, but the upper side has to be a bit more like that, I think.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, just play.

0:37:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the display we put in here, the basic functions, and here where it's most reachable.

0:37:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_01
 The arrow functions.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:37:42	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, this is hard.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I don't have to draw it exactly, do we?

0:37:47	SPEAKER_02
 No, it's okay.

0:37:49	SPEAKER_02
 Let me try it one more time.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe if it's easier if I draw it in one.

0:38:01	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, of course, it will become way more ugly.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_01
 You can make it larger.

0:38:09	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it's easier to draw one.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_02
 It's a tech forever.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_02
 It's fun to work with this pen.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_02
 So larger.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_02
 That's the basic I think.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:38:33	SPEAKER_02
 Side.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_03
 Five minutes left before the meeting ends.

0:38:38	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_02
 Other views?

0:38:41	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_01
 Only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_01
 That's the question.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_02
 Let's fill in the buttons later.

0:38:54	SPEAKER_02
 So this is going to be from the...

0:38:57	SPEAKER_04
 Is this from the side?

0:39:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah.

0:39:02	SPEAKER_04
 Because the screen goes up like that, right?

0:39:05	SPEAKER_04
 So then it's like this.

0:39:07	SPEAKER_04
 Or that's not convenient.

0:39:09	SPEAKER_04
 Then you have to screen like this and you look like the...

0:39:12	SPEAKER_04
 It's better to have it somewhat like this.

0:39:15	SPEAKER_04
 Or does it flip the idea?

0:39:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it is.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_01
 Or is it easier to integrate the LCD screen into this bubble?

0:39:26	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:39:27	SPEAKER_01
 Because it doesn't have to flip.

0:39:30	SPEAKER_01
 Because space for making an LCD...

0:39:34	SPEAKER_04
 It's better to have this like this, I guess.

0:39:38	SPEAKER_04
 And then flip it like this.

0:39:40	SPEAKER_01
 But why do we need the flipping?

0:39:43	SPEAKER_02
 You can adjust the angle to which it flips.

0:39:46	SPEAKER_02
 And it can flip all the way up to there.

0:39:49	SPEAKER_04
 So yeah.

0:39:51	SPEAKER_04
 But we still keep the flipping mechanism.

0:39:54	SPEAKER_02
 Thanks, huh?

0:39:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we keep the flip.

0:39:57	SPEAKER_02
 And because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that...

0:40:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:40:05	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:40:06	SPEAKER_01
 The shape is okay.

0:40:08	SPEAKER_01
 But yeah.

0:40:10	SPEAKER_01
 I don't see the...

0:40:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:40:13	SPEAKER_01
 Why we shoot used the flipping mechanism.

0:40:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:40:16	SPEAKER_02
 I thought it would be cool.

0:40:17	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, yeah.

0:40:18	SPEAKER_01
 It's for...

0:40:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but maybe...

0:40:20	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but maybe we should then...

0:40:22	SPEAKER_01
 Because we have enough space here.

0:40:24	SPEAKER_01
 We got the basic functions.

0:40:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, they are the middle.

0:40:27	SPEAKER_01
 The arrow...

0:40:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:40:29	SPEAKER_04
 Shouldn't we integrate it?

0:40:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and then...

0:40:32	SPEAKER_04
 We should...

0:40:33	SPEAKER_04
 Like...

0:40:34	SPEAKER_04
 Oh.

0:40:35	SPEAKER_04
 Dude.

0:40:38	SPEAKER_04
 Come on.

0:40:39	SPEAKER_04
 So this is the shape.

0:40:42	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, it has a...

0:40:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's not working.

0:40:45	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't end so well.

0:40:47	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side, it doesn't fall on the screen.

0:40:53	SPEAKER_04
 So there's a layer of rubber on the sides.

0:40:56	SPEAKER_04
 Definitely.

0:40:57	SPEAKER_04
 So no flipping.

0:40:58	SPEAKER_04
 No flipping or no flipping.

0:41:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:41:01	SPEAKER_01
 You wanted the flipping, so...

0:41:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I guess, but I mean, most folks can, right?

0:41:05	SPEAKER_01
 If you drop it, it just breaks.

0:41:08	SPEAKER_01
 And it has to be very strong because of the...

0:41:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's a bit strong and the kinetic.

0:41:14	SPEAKER_04
 So you better make it, be better make it like this.

0:41:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, if you go for the connect...

0:41:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, for the children, it's...

0:41:20	SPEAKER_01
 For people not 16 years.

0:41:22	SPEAKER_04
 They're already responsible enough to have a mobile phone, so also to deal with their remote controller.

0:41:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:41:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah?

0:41:30	SPEAKER_02
 Well, yeah, I'm just thinking totally different designs also.

0:41:35	SPEAKER_02
 Remember that the weird pocket phone thing here, which...

0:41:38	SPEAKER_02
 It's like kind of a gameboy, they will shit try something like that.

0:41:41	SPEAKER_03
 I thought up a name for our product.

0:41:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:41:45	SPEAKER_03
 It's called the real remote.

0:41:47	SPEAKER_03
 Ooh, all right.

0:41:49	SPEAKER_03
 Copyright sign of the real.

0:41:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:41:52	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:41:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I like it.

0:41:56	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe you can include that somewhere.

0:41:59	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we should work on our own right.

0:42:01	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah, we have some included in our designs as well.

0:42:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we'll see.

0:42:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:42:09	SPEAKER_04
 How's that?

0:42:10	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:42:11	SPEAKER_03
 See you two half an hour.

0:42:13	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:42:14	SPEAKER_03
 Good luck.

0:42:15	None
 Yep.

0:42:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, that's a side.

0:42:18	SPEAKER_01
 Ah, it's okay.

0:42:20	SPEAKER_01
 But do we want options on the other side with a little bit of buttons?

0:42:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:42:27	SPEAKER_01
 Or I just think we do.

0:42:29	SPEAKER_01
 Could make an infolume button scroll.

0:42:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, or also scrolling for the...

0:42:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:42:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:42:38	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:42:40	SPEAKER_02
 We kind of wanted to stick with the...

0:42:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:42:43	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:42:44	SPEAKER_02
 I'm just thinking if we want to make something different, right?

0:42:50	SPEAKER_02
 So with the scroll is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons.

0:42:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:42:58	SPEAKER_02
 I think...

0:43:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you are going to design it.
