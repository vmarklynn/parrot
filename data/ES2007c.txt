0:00:00	SPEAKER_05
 I feel like Madonna with one of these on.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_04
 I feel like Madonna with one of these on.

0:00:18	SPEAKER_05
 That's cool, we're dancing, they're saying it's like...

0:00:22	SPEAKER_05
 I've always wanted one of these, I really have.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_05
 Which is beautiful.

0:00:36	None
 That's cool.

0:00:46	None
 I feel like Madonna with one of these on.

0:00:56	None
 I feel like Madonna with one of these on.

0:01:06	None
 That's cool.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_03
 Hello everybody.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_03
 Back again for another wonderful meeting.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_03
 Everyone ready?

0:01:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, we can hold on for a minute.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_02
 Oh my gosh.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, wonderful.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_04
 I figured with the spam thing if you can't enjoy it.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_01
 That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to see.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_03
 Are you ready?

0:02:24	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, right, I'll take it that you are already now.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_03
 First off, we'll just recap from our last meeting.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_04
 Which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_04
 We were actually supposed to be doing and who we all are and stuff like that.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_04
 We've got a bit more of an idea together of what's going on.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_04
 What we're going to talk about in this meeting is now that we know what it is that we're doing.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_04
 Now we know that it's a TV remote and stuff.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_04
 You guys have just been off doing some R&D for that.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_04
 Research and development.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_04
 I haven't heard that before.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_04
 Learning all sorts of new tech, terms and technology today.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, you're three little presentations.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_04
 Whether they be on computer or on the white board or whatever you want.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_01
 You have any preference order?

0:03:56	SPEAKER_04
 I'd like to hear who's on the Catherine actually first.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_04
 What I'd like to hear about is if we finally decided on what sort of end you were going to be using.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_04
 I think she's still finishing her.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_06
 Let's hear from you first.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_06
 Where is that thing?

0:04:30	SPEAKER_06
 It's here.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, sorry.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_06
 Look at that work off.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, yourself in position.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, so that's me again.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_06
 So for the energy sources, we can have a basic battery.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_06
 Hand in a mode which is which was used in the 50s for torches if you remember that kind of.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_06
 I don't think any of us remember the 50s.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, it wouldn't be very fancy.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_06
 You can have a kinetic provision of energy which is used on some watches these days.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_06
 So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work or you can use solar cells.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_06
 But I'm not sure about that indoors really.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 Well, there's sometimes combinations.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, like calculators to combinations.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_01
 But also using some solar panels.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_04
 Do you know the solar panel things do they have to work from the Sun or can they work from a light bulb?

0:05:37	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think so.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_03
 Does anybody know?

0:05:39	SPEAKER_01
 I think it has to be only solar energy.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_06
 I don't know.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_06
 I think the cost of less would be the basic battery really.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_06
 And if you want something fancy, I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_06
 But I don't know if it's worth the cost.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_06
 So we've got to discuss that.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_00
 Do I look good?

0:06:11	SPEAKER_06
 For the case of the remote itself, there can be a general case which is just a flat one.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_06
 You can have a curved one or a double curved one.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_06
 If you know what I mean.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_00
 What's a double curved one?

0:06:26	SPEAKER_06
 You know, kind of more ergonomic that kind of sits the palm of your hands.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_06
 Then the case material itself, so it can be either plastic or latex rubber wood or titanium.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_06
 And for each of them, you have cases where, for example, titanium, you can't use it for if we're choosing a double curved case.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_06
 We can't choose titanium.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_06
 And if we're choosing solar cells, then we can't choose latex for the case material.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_06
 So we just have to take that into account.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_06
 But if we're choosing just the flat case, then we can go for anything.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_06
 And I think we discussed earlier on the RSI problem thing.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_06
 So we could do that.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that might be an idea of using the rubber.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_01
 But then it's a, you know, it's kind of squeezable, isn't it?

0:07:30	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah. And also it doesn't break, because easily maybe I can.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_04
 When a TV program's got, when you're watching the match and then you have teams just lost you, you can fuzz it across the road when it will bounce off the wall back at you.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I like that idea.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_06
 So rubber, you think?

0:07:50	SPEAKER_05
 I think rubber.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_04
 Rubber, we're all going, we're all liking that idea.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_04
 You think you can mark it, net?

0:07:57	SPEAKER_05
 After my fashion thing, I think your real life is rubber is more.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_03
 Ooh, we like rubber.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_06
 And then there are the push buttons.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_06
 So you can have basic push buttons or a school wheels, like you have on a mouse.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_06
 Or you can have LCD, if you're displayed.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_06
 And school buttons as well.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_06
 So if you use a rubber double curved case, you must use rubber push buttons.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_06
 So if we're going for rubber, then we have to decide for the case.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_06
 And if we choose double curved, then we have to go for rubber push buttons.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we're going to go where we're, I think we've decided that it's going to be a rubber case.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, but is it a double curved one or not?

0:08:49	SPEAKER_06
 It's not a double curved one, we've got the choice for the push buttons.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_06
 If it's a double curved, we've got to go for rubber push buttons.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_06
 And that makes sense.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_04
 Well, push buttons instead of the wheel.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_01
 If it's rubber, isn't it malleable?

0:09:03	SPEAKER_01
 Anyways, I mean, it doesn't matter if it's a double, I mean, isn't a rubber case, I mean, it's completely, I mean, it flexes to whatever they want.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_01
 So what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubber double, rubber double, double double.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_03
 And you see you've got, okay, the energy, that's one thing.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_03
 I love a big Mac, please.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_06
 Then you have the case is whether it's flat or curved.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_06
 And that's, we don't care if it's rubber or not, but then we've decided that we're going for rubber for the case material.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_06
 So if we've chosen rubber, and if now we have the choice for the case, whether it's flat, single curved or double curved.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_06
 And I'm just saying, if we choose it to be double curved, then we need to go, I don't know why, but we need to go for rubber push buttons.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_06
 So either, I don't know, we just need to decide on the case.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_04
 Let's have rubber push buttons, I go rubber.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_06
 Let's go crazy.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_06
 And then do I have a last slide?

0:10:08	SPEAKER_06
 Yes, I do.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_06
 And so the push buttons themselves, they can be just simple, they can be, so that's just the electronics between the, behind the push buttons.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_06
 And the price that goes with it, so the simple push buttons are going to be the cheapest.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_06
 If we get a scroll wheel that's a higher press range, if we get an advanced chip, which is used for the LCD, the display thing, that's even more expensive.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_00
 Simple print.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_00
 Chip on print.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_00
 Chip on print is the infrared sensor.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, what I'm not understanding here is, okay, advanced chip on print, which I presume is like one PCB.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_04
 And that's got all the electronics on one board, including the infrared sensor.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_04
 Right, what alternatives do we have to that?

0:11:30	SPEAKER_04
 What alternatives do we have to the chip on print?

0:11:33	SPEAKER_06
 Well, if it's not chip on print then, I guess you get different chip components and you build them separately and doesn't include the infrared, it's less expensive.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_06
 Technically speaking, it's not as advanced, but it does the job too.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_04
 So why would we not go for that?

0:11:53	SPEAKER_04
 If it's something that's inside the unit, it doesn't affect whether the customer is going to buy it or not.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_04
 So let's not go for it.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, it's along as it works.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah, I agree.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_04
 So let's not bother with the chip on print.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_06
 So it's either the scroll wheel or the push buttons.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, push buttons.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_05
 What about the sample sensor?

0:12:27	SPEAKER_03
 What about what?

0:12:29	SPEAKER_05
 The sample sensor.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_04
 Well, what do we need to speak before in the remote control unit?

0:12:36	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_05
 It'd be cool.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_06
 It'd be cool, but they're saying they've just developed it.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_06
 I'm just guessing, but it's going to be the most expensive option probably.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_01
 The speech recognition option, it doesn't seem really very promising for us.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's not something that we want to go into with the products.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine, where basically you can program a sample that when you say something, you could response and you could program the response as well.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_01
 It's just clips that you record yourself.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_01
 So you can program your coffee maker that when you say good morning to it, it's like, hello Rick or whatever.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_01
 It would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the TV on, like, turn the TV on and it comes on, but it's not that.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_01
 It just gives you an answer.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_01
 And it gives you a verbal response.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, then.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_01
 What's the point of saying hello remote?

0:13:33	SPEAKER_05
 I thought it was one they say really lonely.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, really lonely.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_05
 I thought when they said voice recognition, they meant like channel five.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_05
 Channel five.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_05
 No, that would be prompting.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_01
 It's just a remote that talks to you.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, there, forget about it.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_01
 I need to certain cues.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, so I'll go back maybe to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem what we should choose.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_06
 So for the energy source, do we go for the battery or do?

0:14:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'm fine with the basic battery.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_04
 Basic battery.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_04
 Cheap, cheerful, it's worked.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_04
 It does work.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_06
 Cheap option.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_06
 Are you happy with that?

0:14:12	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_06
 So we'll go for the battery.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_06
 Then the case, do you want it flat or curved or sink or double?

0:14:23	SPEAKER_04
 We were going with the latest with the RSI rubber.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_01
 So we wanted rubber double curved with the air.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_06
 So it will look like something like this.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_06
 Double waffle please.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_06
 So then if we use double curved case, then we have to use the simple buttons.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_04
 Rubber push buttons, that's fine.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_04
 It's cheap, they're still round.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_04
 It sounds kind of funky.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_04
 And we can also mark it as, because we were saying earlier in your research, that people will get in the complain of RSI.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_04
 And this is anti-RSI.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_04
 So that's another marketing point that we can use.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_05
 Or the rubber push buttons.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_05
 Do you have to move?

0:15:07	SPEAKER_04
 Or do you think anything's going to have buttons?

0:15:10	SPEAKER_04
 Even if it's a jog wheel, it's still repetitive.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_06
 I thought they were given optional flat buttons or...

0:15:18	SPEAKER_04
 You can still get repetitive strain injury, whether you're pressing a button or pressing a flat button screen.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_04
 It's the fact that you're pressing the same, doing the same movement.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_04
 It's not actually what you're doing.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_04
 But the fact that this rubber is actually used in these anti-RSI, specific.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the rubber push buttons.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_01
 We're giving them away to Bernstein, basically.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, so they can sit there and...

0:15:48	SPEAKER_01
 You know, watching TV should be that stressful.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_04
 And you know, you can fuzz it across the room,

0:15:53	SPEAKER_01
 throw it at your children. Throw it at your children's point, if you're watching this book.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_06
 Alright, that's me, Don.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, Gabriel.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_04
 Let's hear from you about the...

0:16:03	SPEAKER_04
 It's the interface.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, some of what I have to say ties into what Katherine was just talking about.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:16:11	None
 Sorry.

0:16:13	None
 Wow.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so I'm continuing with the user interface topic.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_01
 And so basically, I consulted with our manufacturing division, that sounded like Katherine was also speaking with them.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_01
 I also took Reese's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration, because I think that's crucial as far as what keys we're going to include, what buttons we're going to include, and how they laid out.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_01
 And so the manufacturing division sent some samples of interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products, like the coffee machine.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_01
 So, I already mentioned the speech recognition interface.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_01
 I guess we basically vetoed that idea.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_01
 It's pointless.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_01
 It's just a sample sensor, sample output.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_01
 It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality, as far as operating the TV.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_01
 So, yeah, they also give the idea of using a spinning wheel, like you use on the side of an MP3 player like iPod.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_01
 So, we've already addressed that, and I think that would actually be worse for something like RSI, and you got that thumb move that we're constantly doing.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, they're suggestion.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_01
 And I have a feeling that we're interested in something more general, but they suggested going a little bit into a niche, like either gearing a remote towards kids, or you could have a lot of colors.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_01
 The keys might be funny or playful in some way, or something for the elderly, where the remote's very large, and the buttons are very large, and there's only a few buttons.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_01
 But we can discuss this, but it sounded like from our last meeting, we really wanted something that was general, but done well.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_01
 So, the key layout and design are really crucial.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_01
 You want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without always pressing along one.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_01
 And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_01
 I can give you an example here of good layout and bad layout.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_01
 I'm a manufacturing department.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_01
 So this would be an example of bad layout, where you have volume down, but they have a V on both of them.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_01
 So it's sort of confusing for the user.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_01
 Do we have a example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose?

0:19:15	SPEAKER_01
 Brilliant.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_01
 And for something for kids.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_01
 And so, yeah, I think my personal preferences have all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_01
 So I was against the speed track ignition and against going towards anything in the niche sense.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_01
 I think it should be more general.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't think the spinning wheel or the LC display were more crucial for us.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_01
 And, yeah, that's it for me.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, well, let's, so what are our definite decisions on this then?

0:19:57	SPEAKER_04
 As a team, the interface type we're going for.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_01
 So we're not going to have any sort of display.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's just going to be straight set of buttons.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should have a limited number of buttons, ideally.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, like power, channel up, channel down, volume up, one, numerical, keep it.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_01
 And some sort of either have a lock button like we mentioned or a cover.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about it.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, and we're not, yeah.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_01
 We're not that we've decided.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_04
 Are we going to, and are we decided on whether we're going to supplement it with anything, you know, colors.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_04
 Or, you know, gimmicky bits to it.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_04
 We're not, we're just going to go for something.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_01
 It seems like we wouldn't want to make it too busy and too sort of, gotty, but.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I would say maybe a couple of colors like a, like a black with yellow and somewhere like maybe the RR.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, okay, okay, okay.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I don't have any other questions on this.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_01
 Let's move on.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_01
 I guess the fact also that we are having a rubber case would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, sure.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_01
 If we want to have a lock of some sort of, I think that should be.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I can speak with the button department, but I think that it should be easy to have a button that just.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the button does that.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_01
 The other buttons from operating.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_01
 So that should be simple.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_00
 Cool.

0:21:59	None
 Right.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the market.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_05
 And what the fashions are for next year.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_05
 So yes, so from looking at this is trans and fashions and also recent investigation that we've done in the rug control market.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_05
 We have found that from a truck truck.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_05
 These are like most important aspects like that we really need to, which we've already probably discussed.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_05
 The most important aspect is look and feel so the rug control has to look and feel fancy than the ones that already that we already have.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_05
 So it has to be.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, why should people buy this when everybody got a remote that came with the TV?

0:23:01	SPEAKER_05
 Second, should be technologically innovative.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_05
 Innovative.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_05
 So.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_04
 What's that mean?

0:23:11	SPEAKER_05
 Technologically, it should be like work.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_05
 Basically, I guess it should work.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_01
 What should be, it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense, I mean, have something that's a little more technologically advanced.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_04
 Now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_04
 That's cheap.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, these first two points we've already sort of done away from because our rubber one is not fancy.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it's different.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_01
 But I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_01
 If that's what people want, then we're going in the wrong direction.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_01
 And it's not technologically innovative either.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we could.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_05
 That's why I think it's Bluetooth because if you put up Bluetooth and it's a Bluetooth remote control, everybody's going to like, because Bluetooth is in thing nowadays.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_05
 Like really.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_05
 People.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_05
 And when it comes to marketing, that's what people go for.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_05
 They don't really care whether, you know, at the end of the day when it works properly or not.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_05
 Of course they do.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_05
 Well, they do, but it's not.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_04
 Well, 100% less your first thing you go, oh, I'm not going to buy that because I don't know if it works or not.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but it looks good.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_05
 If it looks good and it can just be there for decoration.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_04
 Well, what do you two think about this?

0:24:27	SPEAKER_01
 Is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just synchronize it with other.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, what?

0:24:32	SPEAKER_01
 I don't understand what.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_05
 It always ends up.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_01
 That's basically what it allows you to do.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_04
 And this is just going to do all this has been used for is your television.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but I mean, people, that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it, which no television does.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_05
 If you're looking at something that's going to be bought by people, you have to make it new, you have to make it.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_04
 That would mean we need to make a television as well.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_06
 Bluetooth, for example, in a volume, I think to connect, for example, if you get a call on your mobile phone, but your mobile phone is downstairs or something, you would get on your television, you being called by this person right now, things like that.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_04
 No, that would be your telephone syncing in with your television.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that wouldn't be very much.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_06
 No, but if you get Bluetooth on the remote, you'd be able to...

0:25:30	SPEAKER_04
 The television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible, basically.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_04
 And there is no such thing.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_05
 Like, it doesn't have to be, you know, Bluetooth, that was just an idea, but like, it needs to be something that, you know, is new.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_05
 Whether it's a battery, it could be something really, really minor, you know?

0:25:56	SPEAKER_05
 But I think we are really keeping to what is already out there.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_05
 And people have already seen it, people have already got it.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_05
 If it's something new, we need to move away from what we already have.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_05
 And maybe the kinetic...

0:26:11	SPEAKER_05
 Just go creative.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_06
 Provision of energy, then.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_06
 It's been done for watches, but I haven't seen that for...

0:26:18	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, but yeah, that's very good.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_05
 But then you can market it.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_05
 Never have to change battery again.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_04
 And...

0:26:26	SPEAKER_04
 And this is all tying in very nicely.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_04
 The fact that it's made out of this rubber, we can throw it about, we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about, because it charges itself up, why do they?

0:26:39	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, it's an illegal character, as you say, but not too much.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_01
 But yeah, by the squeezing it...

0:26:44	SPEAKER_01
 Then we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the generating...

0:26:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's a great idea.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_04
 Well done.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_05
 Third, most important aspect.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_05
 Is it easy to use?

0:26:56	SPEAKER_05
 And I think we've all...

0:26:57	SPEAKER_05
 All about that.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_05
 Work set that.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, in the fashion, how it's supposed to look, next year's fashion, very much in fraudulent vegetables, are they like being themed for cloths, shoes and furniture?

0:27:10	SPEAKER_05
 So next year people will be buying.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_05
 I found this really funny.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_05
 You know, strawberry shaped chairs.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_01
 So we can have keys that are like a broccoli key and...

0:27:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_01
 And an avocado.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_05
 I want to watch the pineapple channel.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_05
 And as it's rubber, the feel, which is in this year is spongy.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_05
 So it's not quite spongy.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_04
 Well, spongy, that's where we got it.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_05
 We're ahead of the game there.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_05
 And so, personally, what I was just saying, we're from the current remote controls, like the look and the feel of the current ones.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_05
 And change the look and feel while still keeping to the company's image.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_05
 Basically.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_05
 So yeah.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_05
 What?

0:28:03	SPEAKER_05
 I have to say.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_05
 So we're moving in the right direction.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah, no, this is good.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_04
 So through all that, we're going to go back to going with the kinetic.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_04
 That's great.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_04
 Using the spongy rubber that we were talking about, that's anti-RSI.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_04
 You can, as you squeeze it, you're not only therapeuticizing yourself.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_04
 You are charging the batteries.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_04
 And I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit, though.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_04
 No vegetables.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_05
 Well, maybe make it like fruity colours or something.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_01
 Or the power button could be like a big apple.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_06
 So yeah, but upward, so you're like, well, yeah, this is true.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, this is true.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_01
 They don't own all images of apples.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, we'll make it a pomegranate.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_04
 Well, okay, it seems like the only thing that we haven't really fined.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_04
 A grid on is image.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we're saying now we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables, but we don't know what it should be.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_04
 Or like, we're going, yeah, it should look slick.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_04
 What do we mean by slick?

0:29:30	SPEAKER_04
 Sort of thing.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_05
 I think if it's rubber, it needs to be...

0:29:37	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, you said earlier on that it should be funky.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_05
 I think it should be...

0:29:43	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, what do you associate with rubber?

0:29:46	SPEAKER_05
 You know, like...

0:29:47	SPEAKER_05
 Really different colours.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_02
 Keep it clean.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_05
 I'm sorry I used the wrong word.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_05
 What do you associate with the material?

0:29:54	SPEAKER_05
 That material.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_05
 Like, I'm just thinking bright colours.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_05
 Bright, natural colours, nothing too bright, but not too bright.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_05
 No lime green or bright yellow or bright pink.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_05
 They'll make different colours.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_04
 Like, the volume buttons should be the same colour.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_04
 And the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that, do you mean?

0:30:28	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_05
 And on the back of it have the logo.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_00
 What's easy?

0:30:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_02
 Why not?

0:30:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_01
 The one thing I'm wondering about, I hope that we're not going too much down a gimmicky road of...

0:30:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we're going to...

0:30:50	SPEAKER_01
 If we listen to this story, they're going to see like three or four normal remotes and then a big spongy pink tomato.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I mean...

0:30:59	SPEAKER_01
 What a nice...

0:31:00	SPEAKER_04
 The remote controlled tomato.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_05
 I can say in this country, you'll get, you know, lots of people wanting something really funky and cool.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_05
 Like, and kids will be walking in with their parents saying, I want to buy that one.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_05
 And parents will see the pro in it as well because it's like kids won't break it.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_05
 It's not breakable if you're thrown around.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_05
 Especially with younger kids, you know, they can pick it up.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_05
 The only thing is, it's really small kids much on it.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it's going to be too proof.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_05
 So, it's quite like user friendly and also for different families, like families as well.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_05
 So for little kids and for older kid like teenagers will like it.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_05
 I think especially maybe younger girls, if it's in pink, they'll be like, oh yeah, pink, control for their room, something.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_04
 So, what do you say? Maybe we should mark it in different colours for different.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_04
 So, we could do like the pink range, the blue range, the green range.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_05
 So, like you walk in, you're like, oh, I like that remote control because it's so bright.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_05
 And then, and then the shop assistant comes out and says, oh, what colour would you like it?

0:32:22	SPEAKER_05
 And they go like, oh, I can do the colour.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_05
 Wow, so it puts, I think even the customer into more control of what they're buying.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_05
 Instead of, you got all colour, it's either that or nothing.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_05
 So, they also get to pick.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_05
 Well, personally, I like walking into the shop and choosing a colour.

0:32:37	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, that seems to work well with products like iPod where you have a variety of colours that people feel like they're customising them when they buy it.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_06
 Do you guys, you know, how many, you know, there are some colours that I would never choose.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_06
 And I would be curious how many people choose that.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I think that can be done to build market researching.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_04
 That's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_06
 It's less of the colours.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_03
 All right. Well, all right.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_04
 That's what we're going to aim to get together by the next meeting then.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_04
 So, the next meeting is from you, Catherine, you're going to be working on the look and feel design.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_04
 Gabrielle, you're going to be working on, you know, come up with the user interface design.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_04
 Then, basically, you two are going to be working together, unless you won't be going off to your separate offices.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_04
 And I think you're going to get a chance to play with some clay.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_04
 I think, you know, come up for the next meeting.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_04
 Be able to come in and show us some physical ideas.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_04
 Because at the moment, you know, it's hard.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_04
 We were kind of going, yeah, it's got to feel nice.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_04
 It's got to look cool.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_04
 And now we can actually start some sort of physical something.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_04
 It sounds good.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_04
 And you're going to be working on the product evaluation.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_00
 Evaluation.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_04
 And I will be talking to the bosses, basically.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_04
 And, uh, fielding off some more spam.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_04
 That's it really.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_04
 Keeping things to, well, you know, hopefully, keeping things together.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_04
 This is good.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_04
 So we know for definite, you know, we've now got some definite things going on.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_04
 We definitely know how it's powered.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_04
 We definitely know that it's going to be as simple buttons.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_04
 We're not going to be going for the new technological chip on print, the expensive things.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_04
 Now let's get to vite with these.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_04
 The above features of the $200 and the $250-22, you sell as fun and funky.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_04
 Can, don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to, as a sort of extra something on it, you know, what extra things, other extra things to this product have.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_04
 We're looking to this lock key, facility, I mean, whether or not it happens, it's always possible, I don't know, but something to look into.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, I think that's, well done, everybody.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_04
 Anyone have any questions everyone know what they're doing?

0:36:26	SPEAKER_04
 Because if you don't, I'm sure you'll soon get an email about it.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_01
 I think we all know what you need to do now.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_05
 Excuse your little detail.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, right, well, it's, we're still a couple of minutes until our meetings due to finish.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_04
 But I got a note saying that you two were going to be working together.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_04
 So, okay, I'll stay here.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_04
 Before you all disappear off.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just wondering.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_00
 Hold on, fire.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_01
 Does the peer is immediately come into effect on our next paycheck?

0:37:07	SPEAKER_04
 Or is that, I think it's, yeah, I think it's going to be part more of a profit sharing on the product

0:37:15	SPEAKER_01
 for a bank, I mean, we're getting futures in there.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think that's the way it's going to happen at the moment.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_01
 So we really have that incentive to make this remote work.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_01
 I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits because that's what we're doing.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_04
 I want to share in the spice rocket. Did you see that this company sense, so we might as well have a spaceship.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_01
 This company has its fingers in a lot of different parts.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah,

0:37:48	SPEAKER_01
 what I find out in the money making department.

0:37:52	None
 Oh. I did notice looking at, I mean, they told you that they wanted what our product to represent the RR brand and to be immediately noticeable, I mean, if you look like at the coffee maker at the corporate web page, it's not obvious.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_01
 Our world is to us because we worked here for years and we used that coffee machine, but it doesn't have the color scheme of the company anywhere on it.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_01
 Obviously, it's just so silver and black.

0:38:40	SPEAKER_04
 And the spaceship doesn't have the, do you think they have a massive RR down the side of it?

0:38:44	SPEAKER_04
 But I still want one.

0:38:52	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, I've just had a sign, flesh and upside saying finish the meeting.

0:38:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:39:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I guess that's us.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:39:15	SPEAKER_04
 It's not telling, it's not saying do anything in particular just yet.

0:39:19	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe you should go back to your own offices.

0:39:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:39:24	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:39:26	SPEAKER_06
 Are we taking this off?

0:39:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:39:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.
