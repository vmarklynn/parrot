0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 making a profit of 50 million euros.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_02
 So it's going to have to be pretty out-candy.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_01
 All your remote controls I use usually come with the television.

0:00:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, fairly basic.

0:00:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I was thinking that as well.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_02
 I think the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type thing.

0:00:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the Universal ones.

0:00:22	SPEAKER_02
 So presumably that might be an idea too.

0:00:24	SPEAKER_01
 But the source. 25 new lot of new features.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, because I mean what?

0:00:33	SPEAKER_02
 The 25 euros that's about 15 pounds or so.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_02
 And that's quite a lot for a more control.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_04
 Well, my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black as you said they come with a TV so it's normally just your basic grey black remote controls as a function.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe we could think about colour.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_04
 That might make it a bit different from the rest at least.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_04
 And as you say, we need to have some kind of gimmick.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_04
 So I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, you know that?

0:01:11	SPEAKER_04
 Like the key right?

0:01:12	SPEAKER_02
 Because we always lose our own child.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, right.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, let's go.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, being as a marketing expert I would like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or and other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market?

0:01:31	SPEAKER_00
 What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices?

0:01:35	SPEAKER_00
 What specialty our remote controls are having?

0:01:39	SPEAKER_00
 And how complicated it is to use this remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market?

0:01:46	SPEAKER_00
 So before deciding or before finalizing this project we must discuss all these things.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_00
 And apart from this, it should be having a good look also.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_00
 Because people really like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their CD player, MP3 player like any electronic devices.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_00
 They really want to have something good having a good design in their hands.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_00
 So yes, all this.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_02
 So we're looking for.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, we're looking for the size of the.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry, because as you add more buttons to their modes sometimes it gets so big and clunky.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's like a hundred buttons on it.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_01
 Or you could have a really small slim one but they can lose it easily.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_01
 They need to lose it.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, kind of maybe more like a pda kind of just handhelds like because

0:02:43	SPEAKER_02
 For remember we're trying to make it for 12 years 50.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I wasn't sorry, I was thinking of the screen.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, well I have to I'm having an army in half an hour.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_02
 So we're still looking to a bit actually, no, well I'll keep.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_02
 So you do the looking around at other remote controls.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever and you could look into Basically how how it's made I like how you make it all in one how What sort of materials are available to you, whatever and obviously other instructions have come from The PowerShell Code Right, which will probably just be certain why say so.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_02
 So you want me to look at shapes and everything shapes and colors.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, um basically how to make it attractive design And you make it competition Yeah, do they?

0:03:54	SPEAKER_02
 Go, okay?

0:03:57	SPEAKER_02
 So we have

0:03:59	SPEAKER_03
 Wait for emails
