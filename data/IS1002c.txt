0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 So do we need to retrain Mike on how to put his mic on?

0:00:25	SPEAKER_01
 Can he get it all by himself this time?

0:00:32	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know, I'm feeling like a bumble.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_03
 Probably not.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_01
 I believe I can fly.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_02
 We got some exciting stuff for you guys.

0:00:45	SPEAKER_02
 Or not.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_03
 Or not.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_01
 Just when I needed something exciting.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_01
 Remember I'm an old man.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, ready to go.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_00
 Alright, ready.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so we've got a conceptual design meeting.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_00
 Hopefully we've all got exciting ideas now.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_00
 We do.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_00
 Exciting ideas.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so here's our agenda.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_00
 Our agenda.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_00
 I've got it open.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to talk for a bit about what we're going to do.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to take some notes.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to do a presentation.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_00
 And then hopefully we're going to make some decisions now.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yep.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_00
 Well, when I say hopefully we have to.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm going to let you guys talk before we make decisions.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_00
 Does anyone really want to go first?

0:01:35	SPEAKER_02
 I guess I'll go first.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_00
 You too?

0:01:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_02
 What component I think.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yep, that's it.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_03
 Presented by name.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_02
 My name is Jose.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_02
 My name is name.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_03
 My name is Indigamontaya.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_03
 Indigamontaya.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry, I did this in a bit of a ride.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_02
 Nani!

0:01:59	SPEAKER_02
 So here's a look inside your really old looking remote control.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_02
 You've got a printed circuit board here.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_02
 And you've got all these buttons which kind of press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_02
 We've all broken a remote control.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_02
 It's all broken a remote control.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_02
 So you've also got your chip here, your batteries here, and some sort of electronics.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_01
 I just love you tech guys.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, there's a thingy in the game.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_02
 Well, do jabber.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_02
 So here's a transistor and this amplifies your signal.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_02
 You've got the LED here on the end of the printed circuit board.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_02
 You've got a couple of diodes here for, I don't know, who and what not.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_02
 So we've got in this drawing here, this example here, this is an 18 pin chip.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_02
 It's two AA batteries.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_02
 This is pretty standard remote.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_02
 So here are options for our power sources.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_02
 You can use a basic battery, which we've already discussed.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_02
 Our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo, or maybe you crank it or something like that.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if that's really...

0:03:23	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know, we've got some crazy guys down there in that department.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_01
 I got a flashlight.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_01
 You shake it?

0:03:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but it's interesting because you shake it like this.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_01
 Something like this.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so that's the next bullet.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_01
 That's on the camera.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_02
 The kinetic provision of energy.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_02
 It's like that flashlight where you have to shake it.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_02
 We've got solar cells, which I don't think is a very good idea because you could not use your remote at night.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_02
 Dude, this doesn't make a lot of sense.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_02
 And finally, we've got our power cradle idea.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so we basically have battery versus cradle here.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_02
 Battery versus cradle, I think is...

0:04:02	SPEAKER_03
 I like the kinetic.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_03
 I think you would.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_00
 It's actually a novel thing because you could sell it as a novelty.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_00
 Just to be actually serious for a minute here.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it is more eco-friendly than the cradle because you're still using power off the grid with the cradle.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_02
 So, our case design.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_02
 We have choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_02
 Our material choices are plastic latex type or plastic, a rubber latex type thing, wood or titanium.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_02
 If we go with titanium, we're going to be limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_00
 And yeah, wood gave us a lot of the marketing.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_02
 I think wooded...

0:04:57	SPEAKER_02
 I can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_02
 It's just anti-technology really.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_01
 To me, in a marketing sense, it's not relative.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_01
 We can accentuate whatever product you put in there.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_01
 We can find a way to accentuate.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_02
 And what we may be able to do, and I think this might be the best option, is to combine a couple of these.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_02
 My recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a rubber outer shell.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_02
 To make it like a thick plastic inner shell and kind of a...

0:05:36	SPEAKER_02
 To have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_02
 And also maybe it feels a little better than the plastic.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_00
 You get your wrap on the rubber.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_01
 And if you make it from that super rubber, when you drop it on the floor, it can bounce right back up in your hand.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_01
 You don't even need to lean down to get it.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_02
 The advantage of working with plastic and rubber is we'll have a lot more options in terms of shape because you can extrude plastic and basically any shape you want.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_02
 And then we can cover the breakable bits with rubber.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_02
 But basically these are curved and double curved.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_02
 I believe the tech department in their message to me that they were referring to the number of curves in the bottom.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_02
 I have no idea exactly what they're talking about.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_02
 But that's what they told me.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_02
 Uncurved, flat, curved or double curved.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_02
 I would guess this pen would be kind of like a double curved.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_02
 Where it's curved on multiple axes.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_02
 I think curved means just curved in one axis and double curved is curved in two axes.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_00
 I think it might mean something like that sort of shape because of double cover.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_00
 That's where they're shaped.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_02
 That makes sense.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_02
 With Interface we have the following options.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_02
 We can use push buttons.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_02
 We can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button and LCD display on multiple scrolling wheels.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_02
 So these are all options that the user interface guy has his disposal to put together a user interface.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. For electronics we have these very technical descriptions here.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_02
 A simple chip which is the least expensive but I have no numbers to give you.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_02
 A regular chip which is like the medium porridge.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_02
 The medium.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_00
 Did we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advantage chip?

0:07:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yes. The difference is with a simple chip, a simple chip will operate.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_02
 So when is it going to scroll up?

0:07:47	SPEAKER_02
 A simple chip is required to operate push buttons.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_02
 An advanced chip is required to operate the LCD display.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_02
 It didn't say specifically but I have a hunch that a regular chip is going to be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_02
 So, but yeah.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that makes sense.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see in my presentation.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_00
 Presentation from I guess design which go best.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_00
 Next.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_00
 Technical functions are interface concept.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_03
 I think.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, interface concept.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's right.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, but it has your name on it.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that doesn't board well for it as well.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_03
 So, somehow the thing is too big.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_03
 But, okay.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_03
 Our manufacturing division wanted a speech recognition.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_03
 They say they could put it to work but we don't think so.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_03
 But you'll be, you know, be affected by the other schemes.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_02
 TV is working.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_02
 It's just, I mean, if somebody says up in the middle of the television show, it's going to change the channel.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_03
 And then fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_03
 And I think that's one of the things we want.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_00
 But what if he actually had to press a button to make it recognize?

0:09:23	SPEAKER_00
 So if you press that and run up.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_02
 That kind of would just press the up button.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_00
 That would kind of.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_00
 But if it's just one thing with a button, you can just go.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_02
 Even still there's going to be interference.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_02
 There still will be interference from the TV.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_02
 It might not be completely confusing but I think you'll still, I don't think it's practical at all.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's a bad idea, Frank.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_03
 I'm thinking that away.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_03
 You guys may understand.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_03
 The robot buttons are more reliable.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_03
 It's the ones that would allow us to market our product as being less prone to damage and more resistance to things like spillage of liquids over it or mistreat, misuses as it happens to remote controls.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_03
 As for the point that we're making about losing it, well, we want a small remote control on side because we want it to be cool and designed.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_03
 But apparently the market shows that bigger, bigger remote gets less lost than I would

0:10:39	SPEAKER_02
 believe.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_03
 But yeah, I think we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that somehow. But what I would propose is something more or less in the direction of what is to you the right of that slide but with a less complicated design.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_03
 The numbers, the volume control and channel control and teletext access, the volume and channel control can just become the four button array as in if it was a round dial.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_03
 If you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttoned plus maybe a center one with teletext.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_00
 So we're suggesting a scroll wheel thing for the volume?

0:11:28	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's not a scroll wheel.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_03
 It's just four buttons that are on the cross.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, basically you can control all of the important tasks from that.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_02
 Instead of place, stop rewind and fast forward there.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_02
 That's up, down, louder and quieter.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we go for something mid-size, something that looks good and not too prone to get lost.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_03
 That be it.

0:11:55	None
 Okay.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_00
 So on to...

0:12:05	SPEAKER_00
 Functional requirements are trained watching.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_00
 Train watching is a later date there.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_01
 It looks like it's been so long.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know what to say.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_01
 When I see the product, I don't want to buy it.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 I see so many of them out there.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_01
 There's nothing about that product that makes me want to choose that product over other products that are out there.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_01
 Are you talking about the picture?

0:12:37	SPEAKER_02
 That's not a design.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_02
 That's just something a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, because right now I don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have a product to market yet.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 And from talking to Mike is we can market a more expensive product now.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_01
 That's what I understand.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_00
 I haven't said yes.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_01
 Hello.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_01
 I'm a little bit stuck right now.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_01
 What is it that I'm going to market?

0:13:17	SPEAKER_01
 Without special or increased marketable features, I don't believe the product has a consumer demand.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_01
 I like the idea of the scroll.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_01
 There are so many people making these products at this price right now.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_01
 What are we going to do to make this one special and unique?

0:13:33	SPEAKER_02
 What's special and unique about a scroll?

0:13:36	SPEAKER_01
 I don't kill.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_01
 I just see it as different.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_01
 I don't say it's special.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_01
 I say that it's different.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_01
 What I'm looking for is marketing is give me something different.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_01
 It gives me a lower price, a higher price, some new technology.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_01
 Don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on a shelf.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_01
 It's the same price.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_01
 I need something to market about this thing.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_00
 If we do make the decision to go with the cradle, we have that as well.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_01
 When we have something like the cradle or something, give that as a marketing standard, I need something to market to make this product unique.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_02
 I think the two big points that we have so far are having the cradle and also having the actual design of the case itself, having this rubber shell with a plastic interior, having it look really nice and also be really durable.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_01
 Just remember, when I made up this report, I didn't have the information that we're discussing here.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_01
 When we have a cradle, when we have some kind of design, from my perspective, I don't have a product to market right now.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_01
 My personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost, either lower or develop and integrate new technology.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_01
 That is the next step.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_01
 There's technology and then there's technology, which we're moving into the next phase.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to have some new technology to enhance the marketability.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_01
 Again, I'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_01
 Let's get a product.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_01
 I need a product to market.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_01
 Whatever products you guys put together, we'll find a way to market it.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_01
 That I'm not concerned with.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_01
 Now, if you give me a cut out of what everybody else has, then I need to find a lower cost.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_00
 Our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_00
 Do we go basic or do we go for features?

0:15:54	SPEAKER_00
 Does anybody really want to do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that?

0:15:59	SPEAKER_02
 My question is what would the scroll wheel do?

0:16:03	SPEAKER_02
 Function wise, what does that do?

0:16:05	SPEAKER_00
 That was in your presentation.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_00
 What would you imagine doing?

0:16:09	SPEAKER_02
 It's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_01
 What I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_01
 From a marketing standpoint, I have another door to walk through when we have something unique.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_01
 If it creates something more complex or more expensive, then I don't know if that makes it a marketing necessity.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_01
 Again, from a marketing perspective, I want as much new and different about this thing as possible because it's a very competitive market.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_00
 I understand that the scroll wheels are quite expensive to make.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_02
 They are going to be more expensive.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_02
 On the other hand, it is an alternative.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_02
 If you think that's going to sell some...

0:16:59	SPEAKER_02
 If we're going to make up the extra cost by extra sales, I think maybe it's worth it to do it.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_02
 If I was going to do this, I would just use the scroll wheel for channels up and channels down.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_02
 Do you think volume would be?

0:17:17	SPEAKER_03
 I would first involve it.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_02
 No, we can do multiple scroll wheels.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_00
 I like the idea of basically focusing the product on the idea of the stock to target environmentally friendly ideas.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_00
 It makes it different to market.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_00
 I think so.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_00
 The whole product is going to need to be more durable.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_00
 You're not going to be ditching it as often.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_00
 It's going to need to be more expensive because of the cradle.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_00
 If we can market it in terms of that.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_01
 I think we've got some exclusivity in it.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_01
 We've got something that nobody else has right now.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_01
 That means we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_01
 It also can create its own demand from its uniqueness.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_00
 Our big decision then is how do we do...

0:18:25	SPEAKER_00
 We have to decide on the details and how to decide on...

0:18:28	SPEAKER_00
 Well, not exactly the details, but do we have what type of casing?

0:18:35	SPEAKER_00
 I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_02
 It's something almost like these pens where you have plastic bits.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_02
 It's not really rubber, but just a fused plastic with rubber on the outside.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_00
 Just a very thin sheet for a grip.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe a bit more than is on here.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_02
 Just as an inspiration, these pens I think are kind of...

0:19:02	SPEAKER_00
 So then, do we want to do anything more basic with the more advanced with the user interface in terms of...

0:19:13	SPEAKER_00
 Do we want to go for buttons or do we want...

0:19:19	SPEAKER_00
 If we're ditching the scroll fields, do we want to go LCD?

0:19:22	SPEAKER_00
 Do we want to give... do we want to have anything else on it?

0:19:27	SPEAKER_03
 It's only a TV.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_02
 From my perspective, I think LCD is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all you're doing...

0:19:37	SPEAKER_02
 You're not going to get any information back from the television, so the only information you can display in this remote is what channel you just sent it at last.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_02
 There's just not a lot of information there.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_02
 It receives no information.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_02
 So I don't see any reason for having an LCD because it's an increased cost.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_02
 Unless you can think of something interesting to do with it.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_01
 Right now, there's nothing coming out of the TV to receive.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_01
 So unless technology changes and information starts coming out of a cable box or something, I don't see the necessity of an LCD either.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_01
 I don't see it.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so the question is now, I guess, we need to decide.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_00
 You guys basically have to now go and figure out the details of this thing.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_00
 So what we need to know in terms of marketing and project management are...

0:20:41	SPEAKER_00
 Are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this?

0:20:46	SPEAKER_00
 What overall things have we not decided on?

0:20:50	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the user interface is going to be.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_02
 There's a scroll wheel in or out.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_02
 What do you guys like in the user interface?

0:21:02	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe in terms of marketing, is that going to make it off?

0:21:04	SPEAKER_00
 Again.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_01
 That's going to justify the cost.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think it's the more uniqueness you can bring to the product, the easier it is, I believe for me to market.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_01
 Again, the push buttons I see are everywhere.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_01
 So we can go with the same thing, but we're going to be competing in a broader market than if we go with something unique.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_01
 The other thing I thought about was, do we go to something like this?

0:21:30	SPEAKER_01
 Make a remote that doesn't look like a remote.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_01
 It's just an idea, and I don't know...

0:21:38	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know about the flip phone idea, because I think as far as durability, it's not a big...

0:21:48	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, what I see, one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is, and you've got children, there's stuff that gets inside the circuitry, they get dirty, they get messy with drinks and stuff, this.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_01
 And what I keep throwing out there, I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act, or in some way, identify itself as unique or different.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_01
 But you guys are the ones that have to ultimately create the product within cost.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and I guess the question that you're being asked right now is whether, is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that as a very different product?

0:22:30	SPEAKER_00
 Or do we really need the scroll wheel as well?

0:22:33	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_00
 I said quite a fast...

0:22:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_01
 I think you've got to get into cost effectiveness.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_01
 I think if you can have the base station with a locator, I think those are two very strong features.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_01
 If that's something that can be integrated without a much extra cost.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_02
 The locator is going to require a radio transmitter, which will...

0:22:51	SPEAKER_00
 Is that going to need a better chip as well?

0:22:55	SPEAKER_02
 We're probably going to have to go with it like a medium chip, I would imagine.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_02
 But we will need a receiver in antenna.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_01
 Integrated, yeah.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_01
 So, it's just... I think that's...

0:23:11	SPEAKER_02
 It should be a really simple signal, though.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_01
 I know personally that would be a very attractive feature is to have a button I can push to find my remote control.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if it's a little bit of a signal, but I guess a little tiny speaker is going to be quite cheap.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's not going to need quality, is it?

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_02
 It'll be really cheap.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_01
 I remember you could have a smell of ramma, you know, you push a button and it puts out a stink.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe not.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_00
 Makes your 11 room more fresh as well.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, we're doing well for time here. We've got about another 10 minutes.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_00
 I think that...

0:23:56	SPEAKER_02
 So, the scroll wheel.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_02
 Interrupt.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_00
 My personal preference is out.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think the cost is justified for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_00
 And I don't think it's obvious and natural how it would be used.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think we have, like, it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it breaks down easier.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_02
 For me, I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know exactly what the increased cost is going to be, but I think he does have a point.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_02
 It might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our remote versus something else when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_02
 I think it might be kind of neat to be able to do it like that.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_00
 But then that surely depends a little on the TV because some TVs are quite slow at changing channels.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_00
 So if you've got a scroll here and you have to scroll it really, really slowly just so that you're actually keeping in pace with the TV's ability to change channels.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_00
 You have to go through and you wait for it.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_00
 You scroll a bunch of times and then you wait for it.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I think what it would be is like this where it's maybe a digital wheel, where it's quantized into a circle.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_00
 Ooh, yes, that's where you go.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_00
 My intuition about the scroll wheel would be.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_00
 Ah, see, see if something about now.

0:25:16	None
 Okay.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_02
 It's just a look and feel thing.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_02
 It has the same exact functionality as two buttons.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_01
 I think there are so many people today that are surfing, or television surfers, and I see the scroll as a great mechanism for surfing instead of going button to button.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you just said they're going.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I really think that's a really cool thing for surfing.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_02
 Now, just so you know though, you did bring up a point which is very valid, is a lot of TVs won't respond exactly the same.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_02
 Some of them are going to be kind of slow switching.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_02
 So you may like queue up like 15 channel changes and it'll be like flip, flip, flip.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_00
 Well, there's not necessarily you could basically make it so that it'll, I mean, it's just going to be sending a signal to the TV.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_00
 So if you send about five flip channels, if you did that, it's going to flip once.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_02
 But I think once people get used to it, I do like the idea of the scroll wheel though.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_00
 And if we're marketing it as a high niche product, then we're going to be selling it to people who are buying good TVs as well.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, presumably.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think so.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_01
 I think so.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_01
 The only thing on the interface side of it is that I see the dilemma.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_01
 But if we have the option of scrolling, check it at any particular speed or the option of jumping direct.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_01
 Okay?

0:26:45	SPEAKER_01
 So I can go presuming I have on my television something that tells me what channel I'm on.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_01
 I can scroll direct from channel five to channel 32.

0:26:57	None
 Shunk.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_01
 I know what because it's on a television.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_01
 The television tells me what channel it's on when I change it.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_01
 So I don't know that really that's going to be a problem.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_01
 Because a television can go automatically from channel five to channel 32 with a push of a button.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_01
 Okay?

0:27:14	SPEAKER_01
 So can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system?

0:27:18	SPEAKER_01
 You understand what I'm saying?

0:27:19	SPEAKER_02
 I think I know what you might be getting it.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I see.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe if we had an LCD of the top that just did a number on it, right?

0:27:26	SPEAKER_00
 Or we could read it from a television.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_02
 What about this?

0:27:29	SPEAKER_02
 What about if you can program in your favorite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favorite channels?

0:27:37	SPEAKER_00
 That's great.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_00
 You need that display on the...

0:27:39	SPEAKER_00
 Why?

0:27:40	SPEAKER_00
 It'll tell you when you flip the channel.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_01
 The television can tell you.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_00
 Can.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_00
 No, I see what you're talking about.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's kind of cool.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_02
 How would you program it though?

0:27:49	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, it's just one extra button.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_02
 You say program start and then type in.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_02
 Because you still have the typing, you know, you'll still have the keypad where you can type in manually.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_02
 So the program start 0 1, enter 0 5, enter 38, enter program end.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_00
 And yeah, and that just basically flips between it and it will go.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_00
 It sends out 0 5 and then 36 and then 0 1.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's kind of cool.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_00
 I like that.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_01
 And again, we have another great marketing tool.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_01
 We have about three.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_00
 We have three or four things here.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_00
 That's not going to be too expensive because that's going to be...

0:28:22	SPEAKER_00
 You're going to be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_00
 You can basically come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_01
 And maybe we maybe even have this as in-house technology.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_01
 This may be something that's available through our own services.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_00
 But that's not going to be such a costly feature.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_00
 The problem we're going to have is making it robust.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes, between going through your favorites list and just hitting up 1, up 2.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_01
 We go directional.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_01
 So if there's a button...

0:28:56	SPEAKER_01
 We go this way for one, we go this way for the other.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_02
 No, because you want to be able to go up and down through the channels.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, people are going to have a favorite sort of whether they do that or whatever they do.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_01
 Well, then you just have a different...

0:29:05	SPEAKER_01
 You have a mode switch.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_02
 I think we'll need a mode switch.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_02
 But then if we have a mode switch, we're going to need some kind of indicator to switch.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_00
 It's a white behind buttons.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_00
 And LED.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_02
 And LED.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_00
 Does that work?

0:29:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_00
 Is that...

0:29:19	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, we have five minutes.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_00
 So, right, details that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_00
 We want a mode indicator.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_00
 We want backlit buttons.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_00
 And if we're making backlit buttons, period, do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you're pressing at the time so that you know if it's actually pressed or not?

0:29:48	SPEAKER_00
 I've seen some remotes do that.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_02
 Just so you know, I think...

0:29:51	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, it was my understanding that before we were going to stay in the mid-market range, it seems we're kind of approaching a higher end range.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_02
 I think we are.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_01
 I want to make sure everybody's okay with that.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you had acknowledged that we have more money for this.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, well, we don't have...

0:30:04	SPEAKER_00
 It's not that we have more money, we can push up the price.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_00
 That's what I mean.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_01
 We can increase the cost.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_01
 So, I don't know.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know how we're having to...

0:30:12	SPEAKER_02
 Just want to make sure everybody's on board with it.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_00
 So, we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to, though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_00
 But, I'd say, what sort of price are we looking to be able to sell, something like that, and what sort of price can we make it for?

0:30:27	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think the design and technology has to come back and say, okay, to create this product, we see it's going to cost us this much for this volume, because we do have a volume target of 50 million profit.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_00
 No, I think that's where we really should be more flexible than anything else, because as we said in the last meeting, our management's really looking for us to push our brand.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_00
 We're entering a new market here, so I think the profit expectation for this one product is maybe not as important as being able to...

0:30:55	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_01
 I'm okay with that.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_01
 I guess what I just want...

0:30:58	SPEAKER_01
 To me, the next step is for these guys to come in with a design proposal with the cost estimate attached.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_01
 And then we have to take this to the next level.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_00
 That's a ball-parkest of what we'd be able to sell, something like that.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_00
 Well, yeah.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_02
 Let's try to think now.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_02
 How much would you pay for... with all these features, how much would you pay if you went to the store and you were in the market to replace your TV remote?

0:31:19	SPEAKER_02
 How much would you pay for that?

0:31:20	SPEAKER_00
 Well, you got to think who our target market is, because I'm not our target market.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_00
 I'm a student.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_00
 But if, on the other hand, I would think...

0:31:31	SPEAKER_00
 With my project manager salary.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_00
 You could probably afford this.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I could probably afford this.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_00
 But maybe if I had a cool new TV and this was looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel, which I think is a really cool idea, that would sell me on it a little.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_00
 Then maybe...

0:31:47	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think I'd go over 100 euros, certainly.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, no.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_00
 That would be way too much.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_00
 But I would be happy paying over 40 for it, I guess.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_02
 I would say 35 to 40.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_01
 I was going to say 35 to 50.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_00
 35 to 50 euros is a sales bracket.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_01
 One of the things we're marketing about this product is this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_01
 It's one of the marketing features in this.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_00
 That's why the scroll needs to be really robust.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_03
 So we'll come up with something between 35 and 50 that is rug the rubber, robust with scroll wheel with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favorite stuff, favorite channels.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_02
 With the cradle, radio transmitters.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_02
 And the locator.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_02
 And backlit buttons and it's going to look sexy.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_02
 Or not.

0:32:37	SPEAKER_02
 Or not.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_02
 It might look like clay.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_03
 So you can market.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_01
 That's easy.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_01
 That's not a... that's a... no.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_01
 Because we have about six... six, seven features in that alone.

0:32:52	None
 Yep.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_01
 Under the title of uniquenesses.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_01
 Hmm.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_00
 The next meeting starts in 30 minutes, although it does it, it starts at 3.21 the next meeting.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_00
 So we've got more than 30 minutes.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_00
 We've got like 50.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_01
 What?

0:33:10	SPEAKER_01
 It's my 3.21.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_01
 It's the next meeting.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_00
 The next meeting is 3.21, yeah.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_01
 That's almost 50 minutes.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_00
 That is.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_00
 You guys have changed the times from the presentations.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_01
 You guys can create a...

0:33:23	SPEAKER_01
 Probably...

0:33:24	SPEAKER_02
 We'll let you know when we're done.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_00
 If we can go earlier.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_00
 Thanks, Chef.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_00
 So you guys will be getting your modelling done now.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_00
 And...

0:33:34	None
 Okay.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_00
 Are there any other questions with regards to what this thing's going to do?

0:33:40	SPEAKER_00
 Look like how it's going to work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in a lot of detail.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think so.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_02
 If we need questions, we'll just email you, I guess.

0:33:52	None
 Okay.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_03
 I think it pretty much everything's covered.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_00
 This one was quite easy.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_00
 Could have been worse.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_00
 It's always the optimist.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, I am.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_01
 Thanks, guys.

0:34:05	None
 Thank you.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_01
 I don't have any emails.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_01
 This means I can go home.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_00
 It's going to be easy, yeah.

0:34:11	None
 Oh, we gotta leave.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe I just keep working.

0:34:16	None
 Lift the pen.

0:34:17	None
 Maybe I just keep working.

0:34:28	None
 I'm on the mother node.

0:34:35	None
 I didn't care about it.
