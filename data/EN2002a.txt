0:00:00	SPEAKER_00
 I wonder how many other meetings is talking about the stuff with the meetings.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look at all these stuff, man.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_01
 What is that? Okay.

0:00:10	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:00:12	SPEAKER_02
 So, what do we need to talk about?

0:00:15	SPEAKER_02
 Shall we just go around and everyone says what they've been doing?

0:00:19	SPEAKER_02
 We've done anything.

0:00:20	SPEAKER_02
 Not a lot.

0:00:23	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I'm sorry.

0:00:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_00
 Sounds like you've done something.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I've got a browser now, which, whoops.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_02
 Good stuff.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I dropped mine as well.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_01
 Give it this.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_03
 This wasn't a good story.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah, we've got a browser with, which comes up automatically with the transcription box and the topics.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_02
 And then when you go on the menu, you can select the summarization box, which pops up, and an audio player.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_02
 And I think the search works as well.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_02
 So, pop up the search.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_02
 And it loads up just the background window, so empty.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_02
 And so when you start, you have to either open, open a particular observation or do a search and open it through that.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_02
 That makes sense.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_02
 The transcription box has got a summarize button, which doesn't do anything yet.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_02
 Now, I wonder how we want to do, you know, we want to pop up window with the speaker characterization.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_02
 Either we could do that, you know, when does a pop up come?

0:01:51	SPEAKER_02
 Either we can, when you click on the ID, any sort of ID in the transcription box, or we can put an extra button, extra few buttons next to the summarize button, so that you actually in the transcription box, but so like you click on the button and then it opens into whatever that speaker characterization is.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_02
 The left click is already used because it highlights that part of speech or whatever that, what are you saying?

0:02:19	SPEAKER_01
 The left click, all right.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_02
 The left click highlights it.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_02
 So that you can, I don't know what happens when you double click actually, but that'll be a bit annoying if you have the left click for one thing and double click for something else.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_02
 I think, so yeah, when you left click it, you can, for example, set the marker there so that the audio goes from there, I think.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_02
 So we can't put it on left click.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_02
 We could put it on the right click.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_02
 We could, for example, have a little menu that pops up.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it might be quite good, I suppose.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_02
 So right click on it menu, you know, and you can click on speaker characterization of the pop cylinder.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_01
 What else could we have in the menu?

0:02:59	SPEAKER_02
 That's a good point.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_01
 So otherwise we just have a right click on you.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but I don't know about you, but usually in windows right click.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_02
 Is it window?

0:03:11	SPEAKER_02
 It opens a menu.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_02
 The menu, yeah.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's way to be, doesn't it?

0:03:15	SPEAKER_01
 It's a bit weird to just start bringing that stuff in it.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_00
 It just sounds sort of, same sort of idiom throughout.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_02
 Or just, you know, or just the button.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_03
 I guess a bit of button makes a bit more sense because otherwise you don't really know that.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, what if I write click now?

0:03:37	SPEAKER_03
 What happens then?

0:03:38	SPEAKER_03
 Well, no, more.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_02
 It's not a visual.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_02
 The menu pop up.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_02
 Well, oh, yeah.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_02
 It's more obvious.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_02
 It's more idiot proof.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_01
 It's got a button.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_02
 That's true.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_00
 It's more interesting.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we'll have more things in the future than we have.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_00
 More flexible.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I guess in meeting browser 1.1, you can have a menu instead of a button.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_01
 This one.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_02
 But actually what we could do is in that menu as well, we could have an option that pops up a window with all the meetings that that user has been in.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_02
 Like a search for that user.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_02
 Is that going to be useful or too much?

0:04:27	SPEAKER_01
 I guess so.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_01
 So what did you, part of the menu that comes down is says, give me all your meetings or something.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_02
 So when you write click on it, one option will be, give me all your meetings, characterize the speaker.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_02
 Or is that too much?

0:04:45	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, I guess so.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_03
 It's more like part of the.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_03
 Browsing sort of thing more than the speaker character.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_03
 Steve mentioned.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_03
 So we didn't know how to.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_02
 Involve the speaker characters.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe tie that in with dialogue acts or something as well.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, speaker characterization.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_00
 Just some way to sort of leverage that information.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_00
 Like we have it for doing it.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_00
 But what does it help the browsing or what can it give us?

0:05:16	SPEAKER_00
 What do you mean that the speaker characterization?

0:05:18	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, well.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know about that.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, the speaker characterization is a bit like you said.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, it's like a nice thing.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_02
 We're not actually sure what the user wants with it, but it's interesting.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_02
 So why don't you give it to him?

0:05:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should do it.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like, well, if you get the speaker characterization that someone talks a lot in a certain topic.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_03
 And then if you click on that topic, you get everything that's in that topic.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, that's still another level further.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, we're not even there yet.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_02
 The pop of the speaker characterization.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_02
 We have to first define what happens when you click on a user.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_01
 If they have a speaker characterization first before we cross any other, I would be so happy.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_02
 So should we try to do a right click when you then?

0:06:12	None
 Yeah.

0:06:13	None
 All right.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. All right.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_00
 That's just from the main.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_00
 Even if anyone comes in a particular window, like we want to sort of get like if we're on the users versus like a topic or something.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_02
 For these various things.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_02
 Wait. Yeah.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_02
 There's a second thing about the topics, the topic window.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_02
 You want to somehow click, be able to click on a topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_02
 So we could do that in a similar way to it right.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_01
 So this is for consistent round.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_01
 On the speaker.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_02
 This is.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_02
 So we have basically two options of browsing the meetings is by either.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_02
 Searching and opening.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_02
 Individual observations and when then we have the interlinking by right click.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, yeah, like another common thing like if we have it so set up that if you double click and it goes to a default thing on the screen.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, that's kind of a typical kind of action.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_00
 Double click.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_00
 If you double click on a particular topic or something, then it goes to sort of like a default.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, so it will be like all the.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_00
 Um, cases of that topic either, whatever we decide the default to be, whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting and just show up the particular.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_00
 Instances of that topic.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_00
 And just think to have the default there.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_00
 So if somebody knows exactly what they want to do and we know that that's the most common thing that's going to happen.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_00
 So the double click will do that and say from the trouble of right clicking and choosing the item on the menu.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_02
 I don't see there's anything obvious that would be able to know that would be.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_00
 Might come to us.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_00
 Start playing with it.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_00
 What was that?

0:07:50	SPEAKER_01
 I think I understand.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_01
 Do you mean like we have to do the right click menu?

0:07:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_00
 Right click.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_00
 But instead of like have a default double click.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, so it will be a choice.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_00
 It's the most common.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, exactly.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_03
 Like I'm not sure the speaker characterization.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_02
 Then there's a problem with a lot of windows popping up again and they pop up without you being quite sure what it is.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_03
 But if you do double click on something, don't you expect something to happen?

0:08:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I mean sort of.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_03
 It's not as you did.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_01
 I'll go away.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_01
 Stop coming up.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_00
 I'll be closing.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_00
 It's not.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_00
 Especially if you haven't touched panel.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_02
 I'll check what it does on double click at the moment.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_02
 Because I think it might do something.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_02
 It's good.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_02
 But I don't.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_02
 I don't.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_02
 I really don't see anything obvious that.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, if you can think of something.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_02
 I guess at the point, I'm.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_03
 The.

0:09:05	None
 Yeah.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_03
 What you're clicking on.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_02
 Another thing.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_02
 Single audio files.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_02
 Do we want to use them or not?

0:09:17	SPEAKER_01
 We don't know.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_01
 Do you mean single channel?

0:09:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_02
 Single channel.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_02
 Single channel files.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 Do we want them?

0:09:26	SPEAKER_01
 I mean.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_01
 Probably not.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_01
 But we might need them for the experiences.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_01
 If we try to do it in audio.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_02
 We might use them.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_02
 No, but.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_02
 To work with them.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_02
 But do we want to integrate them so that when you browse, we can.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_01
 We might want to be able to say, oh, just give me what that person saying.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_01
 Do you though?

0:09:42	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_02
 It's not going to make much sense if you're listening to it on his hand.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_01
 Do you?

0:09:46	SPEAKER_01
 Unless you can't hear it properly or something.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_01
 Somebody's talking over somebody else or something.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_01
 Which is saying note for now and put it in.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_01
 Because otherwise it will increase the amount of data we need for a lot of time.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_01
 The footprint will be there.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:10:04	None
 Yeah.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_02
 What do people think in general about the Windows Cluttering that you mentioned?

0:10:14	SPEAKER_02
 Do you think we need that?

0:10:15	SPEAKER_02
 I think we probably need that.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_00
 Don't have the full flexibility we need to have.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_00
 That's what I feel as well.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, I'm very much, I want to have everything customizable.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_00
 The thing is typically though, is someone can have five Windows open at the same time?

0:10:30	SPEAKER_00
 Probably not.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_00
 Probably just two or three of whatever.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_00
 Two or three of whatever.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_00
 Whatever they're looking at like dial on their x.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah, it depends.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, I really want to put the summary in somewhere, you know.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_02
 And the summary, for example, is typical you open the window, you read through it, you might click up, you know, close it against straight away.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_02
 But it'd be good to have it there.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's fine.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it couldn't be.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, you probably, I don't know if you want to have like the full transcription and the summary at the same time.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe you can just like choose the same window for transcription and summary.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_00
 It's like how a tab there.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_03
 I was just like in a tab.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_03
 Tabs are nice.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, Tabs are nice.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, Tabs are nice.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sure.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_01
 It's a bit of a cripple job as a windowing toolkit.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_01
 Sometimes it's a bit of a cripple.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_02
 I can have a look.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_01
 Or just, I don't know.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that might be changed to contents of the same window.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_00
 Or even just have buttons on it.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_00
 Toggle buttons or something on the toolbar.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_00
 That window.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_00
 That's something.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_00
 That doesn't have to be a tab or whatever.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_00
 No, no.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_03
 It could be like transcription, summary, like two buttons and you just press on one button.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_00
 Or check marks.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_01
 That would reduce the number of windows needed.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_01
 Which is for you.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_01
 Photoshop has a lot of windows.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_01
 If you use Photoshop, it's got loads and you're always forever going.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_01
 I'll get out of the way.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_01
 There's always stuff in the way.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know why.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_02
 I mean people get used to it.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_02
 When you use windows, you have a lot of windows open.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 Do you manage them?

0:12:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_01
 Unless Kenny, I don't suppose you can minimize them and stuff like that.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_01
 You can minimize them.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_01
 Of course you can.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_00
 Like a lot of these can be.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_00
 Like once we get the disfluencies out, then we can, you know, transcript with the disfluency transcript with the different disciplines.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_00
 I love these sort of using the same window.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_00
 They're definitely going to be in the same window.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_00
 And probably mutually.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_02
 That was a plan for the disfluency anyway.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_02
 So.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_02
 Do you want to do that with summaries and put the summaries in in the same window?

0:13:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I don't know.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_02
 With transcripts.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_03
 It sounds reasonable to have like transcripts, like maybe three alternatives then like full meeting, meeting without disfluencies and summarize.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:28	None
 Yeah.

0:13:29	None
 Yeah.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:32	None
 Yeah.

0:13:33	None
 Yeah.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_02
 And finally, the prototype is about what kind of prototype could be produced?

0:13:42	SPEAKER_02
 Probably.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_02
 Because I'm just, you know, I go into the lab and I say, like, what am I going to change today?

0:13:49	SPEAKER_02
 You know, and it kind of just, it just develops.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not aiming for anything.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_02
 Do we want to aim for something?

0:13:57	SPEAKER_01
 Um.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_02
 I'm pretty much getting there anyway.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_02
 It's not going to be a lot more.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_02
 I guess it is.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, just to try it.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, for us to be able to do something that we can include with your thing.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_01
 That's what we need.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_01
 Something just slightly more than just that.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_03
 Just so see the integration works sort of between the different couple.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 Definitely.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_03
 So I guess that's what we need to take it for.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's kind of what it meant as well, isn't it?

0:14:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_01
 Ting it, ting it sort of start to do stuff rather than just be.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I guess, I mean, that was probably our intention, but we might not have written it down.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_00
 If you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable, then we know the directory to get in.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if it's readable at the moment, but you can show it.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_01
 I think you put it on there.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_01
 No, they're not world readable.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_01
 They're not done.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_01
 They're only default.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_02
 Then only you can read them.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_02
 You can see them, but you can't read them.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I'll make that readable then.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_00
 So the directory is my number.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_02
 Or you could just email.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_02
 Well, this is not difficult.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_02
 What's your number?

0:15:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_02
 In all the emails.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_02
 So it's my five five five six.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 Again.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, for a four five five six.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_02
 And then it's.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_02
 And then there's a folder.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_02
 And it's called the m browser.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_02
 The M browser.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_01
 M for me.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_01
 I hope you never have to look in my directory.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_01
 It's just pure chaos.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_01
 No, I'm extremely organized.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_01
 Mine is serious chaos.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_01
 But I was everywhere.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yep.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_02
 So that's me doing someone else want to talk about this stuff.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_01
 Final jump at one.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_03
 I can tell you what I done in the SPT.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, I don't know.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_03
 I basically started like browsing a bit just like trying to see if there's anything out there to use sort of.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_03
 What were you doing again?

0:16:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_00
 Like that was behind the question.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_00
 Using code and stuff.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_03
 And you found some code for it.

0:17:13	None
 Yeah.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I don't know if it's usable.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_03
 I haven't looked at it, but I found some code for like from a tutorial about indexing.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, cool.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_01
 So even if it doesn't work, you can do a report grid around and make it work.

0:17:25	None
 Yeah.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_00
 Well, probably stopped to do some other file management.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_02
 So you think you shouldn't be too difficult?

0:17:40	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_03
 I was a bit worried about one.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_03
 Well, when he talked about this with a file, that's not what it falls.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, how much do we actually need to do like extracting things from XML files and stuff to be able to do the indexing?

0:17:58	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I see.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_02
 I have to convert it to some sort of format.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_01
 I've been trying to write something to read the XML and get rid of it.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_01
 And I can get rid of it, but I'm having trouble pointing anywhere else.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_01
 So it'll come up on the screen.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I have a look at the browser code then because, you know, they're already extract, for example, transcripts.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_03
 I'm sure they do.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_01
 I will.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sure I'm making a main of it.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_03
 I guess, I mean, it was a good point you had that like collaborating with the file things.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, if you already started on.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_01
 We can share as much as possible.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_03
 Should we, I don't know, meet up and see what we can do.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I don't know, see what you've done and see what we need, what we need.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
 Next week, I'm done.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_00
 So you're still.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_01
 I actually haven't done anything this week because this week's been manic.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, this week's only two days old.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_01
 Well, whatever it was last week.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_01
 The week as he is rather than the proper week, you know, it's been all a bit manic.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that's your NSP and LPN SP2.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_00
 That's right.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_01
 And then we had to do an IRP, whatever it was last week as well, which is only a page long, but it's quite difficult to write a page.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_01
 That's complete.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_01
 But it was, I had to sit there and think about it for a bit.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_01
 This is a bit irritating.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_01
 But SP and LPN.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_00
 So, yeah, I was thinking the week, Jen, probably started attacking this seriously.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just, you know, hopefully I'm something buying next week that we can sort of try and decorate it into the group.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_00
 Mm-hmm.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_02
 Well, so the browser's, I use it now.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_02
 Or as, you know, it was there when I took it.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_02
 Um, uses the, um, the NXT search to get the data out of the files, which I think is odd, but I'm not quite sure how it works.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_02
 I don't quite understand it.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_01
 So when it, when it.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_02
 To get the data, for example, to get the summarization data, you have to search for, I think, the IDs or something.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_01
 That's privacy always.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 I guess it's like, where it's got the, that is privacy.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_02
 So they don't, you know, they don't say, look in that, not folder, but, yeah, such everything.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_01
 That is privacy always.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_00
 Hm.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_00
 Well, they did say it wasn't the most efficient.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_02
 It does load up quite quickly.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. But, you know, but what, what is it like a window where you have to write a search query or is it just what's behind it.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_03
 So, or not the actual search.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_02
 This is just when you open, you know, to load the transcript, for example, yeah, to find the transcript.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_02
 It does does the next see search for the string.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know, transcript or text.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_01
 So, for, and it, what, like, it just has an open variable, transport, whatever, find everything that's got that and then load.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_02
 So, I don't know if you've looked at the search query language, but it's like a dollar, a text.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_02
 Because that's the, I could, the close variable doesn't have any.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_02
 And then, yeah.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_02
 Because every, every of all of these, um, these files have got an ID and all the transcript files have got the string.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what it is, words or text or something.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_02
 So, I just search for those files.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_02
 What do you do?

0:22:25	SPEAKER_03
 When you, like, is there a open thingy or, what are you, like, what did you do to, like, how did you figure out that this uses the next to the search?

0:22:37	SPEAKER_02
 Um, is it, um, well, it's in the code.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_02
 So, you know, you define a search object and then you search about the string.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_02
 I had to figure out how to, how to do the same thing for the summary.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_02
 That's how I, how to understand how to do the transcript, how they did the transcript to do the summary.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_01
 So did you have to write it in the way that they wrote it?

0:22:59	SPEAKER_02
 Is that what you did?

0:23:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_02
 Just search for specific string.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_00
 One.

0:23:04	None
 I just think.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_02
 So, you could just, you know, you could use that when you, if you were, um, take the data out.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_01
 If you did that, I was just thinking that you, yeah.

0:23:14	None
 Yeah.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_02
 If you have a question about what the code means or where to find the code that you want, you know, whatever you want to do, then just send me email.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_02
 I can explain it.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_01
 If it annotated your code.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, in the moment it's got a load rubbish because the, the, the browser that I used from this, from, you know, that they gave us had a lot of extra stuff in and I have debt thrown out to throw out all the functions.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_02
 Just in case.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_01
 Just in case.

0:23:46	None
 Yeah.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_02
 So they're all in there.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_02
 Still a lot of rubbish, but we'll be, we'll be chucked down at the end.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_01
 Coming, commenting it out one bit at a time.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_01
 Running it.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_04
 Good.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_04
 So basically we got kind of this work.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:10	None
 That's just too long.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_01
 The last of that is a little bit of a log in the short.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_01
 We can, but we can still fall days off.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_01
 Still at the bottom of the mountain.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_00
 How many hours is this?

0:24:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_02
 How much?

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 Well, should you find his what to explore any other.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_01
 How's your, how's your, how's your, um, uh, quantifier raising?

0:24:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_02
 I can't remember what I'm supposed to do, by the way.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_02
 Am I supposed to do the summarization thing you bought?

0:24:50	None
 No.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_04
 What's doing?

0:24:58	SPEAKER_04
 I'm just going to go to the next slide.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_00
 You do.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, really?

0:25:05	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I'll do that then.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_00
 This can be changed.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_00
 Shall I do that?

0:25:08	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, I don't know.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't matter.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_00
 Well, you know, if you want to, I mean, let's just play around with some extra stuff.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_02
 We have some time.

0:25:14	None
 Why not?

0:25:15	None
 It shouldn't be different.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_01
 So what courses should I pick to be not doing any good?

0:25:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_02
 And I'm doing communications.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_02
 Which we had one exercise and I've done that like two weeks ago.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_02
 That's in two weeks.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_00
 In products, of course.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_02
 So I was like nine, nine courses, well, ten or something.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'm doing parallel programming languages and systems.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_02
 Which we had one exercise as well.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_02
 And that seemed like Friday.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I'm not doing any background reading.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_03
 Just a big, yeah.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_00
 I'll be happy when this week is over.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_03
 I'll be happy when this course is over.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_00
 Is that about it then?

0:26:13	SPEAKER_00
 Anything else we need to discuss?

0:26:16	SPEAKER_00
 Did we want to meet before we talk to Steve next week?

0:26:21	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I don't know.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_00
 We'll probably get some work done over the weekend.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_00
 So I know after the analogy or something.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_00
 And just have a little quick little update.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, if you like.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_00
 We can always decide then.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_02
 So what are you planning to do over the weekend then?

0:26:40	SPEAKER_00
 Search.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_02
 You're going to do the search.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to do the search.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_00
 Couldn't be that hard.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it'll be still limited version of the next query.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_00
 Don't be the whole thing.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_00
 Like we can just decide sort of things that we do want to do.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_00
 Well, actually, most of just dialogue acts.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_00
 And I'll switch around.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_02
 I think we need to set ourselves some milestones because otherwise.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we'll get.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_00
 We'll get by.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_00
 Pretty quick.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_00
 Like you're saying, like she do, we want to set a date for interim prototype.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_00
 Specifically.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, you decide.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_03
 The progress report is.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_03
 Two and twenty.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_03
 The third.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_03
 Of February.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_01
 So what's that to me?

0:27:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_02
 Well, how about we get it done by then?

0:28:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_01
 Then we can write about it in the interim report.

0:28:12	None
 Yeah.

0:28:13	None
 Yeah.

0:28:14	None
 So.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_03
 Just looking at my own deadlines.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, when the search interface.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe you should decide pretty, pretty early what kind of things you want to be able to search for.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_02
 And then if you want, you can give out to me now.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_02
 I'll build your nice, you know, a few tick boxes and drop down menus.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_03
 Wasn't like what you had now.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_03
 Wasn't that pretty much what we read on or was it just like so on.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_03
 That doesn't exist.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_02
 That was completely cut and pasted.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, okay.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_02
 That does not exist.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_02
 Nicely done, though, isn't it?

0:29:02	SPEAKER_02
 It's actually all these things that are nicked from, you know, all these drop down menus and tick boxes are nicked from Google.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_02
 It's a screenshot of Google.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_03
 Oh.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_03
 That's not.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_03
 I'm impressed.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you should make it exist then.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_02
 It's going to be a little difficult.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I mean, I was going to, but, you know, the whole drop down menus and stuff, what we want to search for is not quite agreed on.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_02
 We never agreed on what we want to be able to search for.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_02
 No, it's not.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_00
 So, aside on that, I'm probably going to.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, do you want to, you know, just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_02
 And then we could discuss at next meeting, which options we really want to include.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_02
 I would probably involve researching the query language a bit as well to see what that can do.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_03
 It would be nice to meet up and show us a bit, but, you know, already, so we don't have to do all the work again.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_03
 Just like figuring out stuff.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, just like the basics.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_03
 No, already.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_03
 Just like accessing the corpus and stuff.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, just like all the, and seeing the code and just sort of how just to see the basics of what you've done, like just get a quick look over and just can take us for a tutorial.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_00
 You know, the class paths, all that sort of thing.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_00
 Just say, okay, well, here's everything's basically.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_01
 Just show up.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_01
 Next week's.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_00
 In the morning.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_00
 Well, there's some I'm the teacher.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_00
 Something like that could happen anytime because, yeah, like my schedule was like a class, right, class, right, class.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I was not going to take an hour.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I know exactly.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_00
 That's why I'm thinking so I'm like that man.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_00
 If I have a class, I can run off and do it.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_02
 Pick a time.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_02
 Monday, Monday might be good.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_02
 Monday.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_00
 Anytime.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_00
 Not at noon or two or four.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_00
 No, in between those.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_00
 Three o'clock.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, yeah.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_02
 Three.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_01
 It was one time today and I'll do four.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_02
 It's four.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_02
 I guess you want to do it after.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's an option too.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:34	None
 Three.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_01
 Three is good though, but we have.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_00
 Three 30.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it doesn't matter.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_01
 Three 30 in the computer room in here and then we can just go in there.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_01
 If you can get in the front door, we haven't got a key.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_00
 Can none of you get in?

0:31:54	SPEAKER_00
 We can get in the three.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_01
 The computer rooms in here, the MSC computer.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_00
 I don't found that yet.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_01
 It's in here.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_01
 If you find me, I'll show you where I let us all in there.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_01
 Now, afterwards.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_01
 You did need to have a key for it.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_00
 That's the thing.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_00
 Just bang on it.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, somebody else was asking Steve about that whether we can get in there, whether he's going to get us access.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_03
 Into what?

0:32:19	SPEAKER_01
 The computer room.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_01
 It's only got this crap.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_01
 It's only got about four or five convenience.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_01
 But it would do quite a good garage.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_01
 Because it can all sit around.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_01
 It's not very up.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_01
 Not many people in it.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_00
 Is there a printer in there too?

0:32:30	SPEAKER_01
 And there's a photocopier with the code on it.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_01
 It's cool.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I'm just going to cover it.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_00
 I've heard of it.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_00
 I've heard of it.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_00
 We've got it on my computer.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_00
 One of the comments I'm thinking.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_03
 So, what time do we say?

0:32:47	SPEAKER_02
 I just think it's better to do afterwards than we have all the time.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_02
 That's all right.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_02
 Then have half an hour and then we'll definitely run out.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:56	None
 Okay.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_03
 As long as the analogy doesn't go late.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_01
 Hopefully it's not that man's hurt.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_01
 It won't matter.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, it's not even confirmed yet.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_02
 What?

0:33:09	SPEAKER_02
 She doesn't even know what she's talking about yet.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it doesn't happen at all.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_02
 It's reading week next week.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_02
 Should it be?

0:33:17	SPEAKER_03
 Really?

0:33:18	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's supposed to be.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_03
 Next week.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_03
 It's week six next week.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think we have a reading week though.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_03
 We have one class at least.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_03
 When we speak perception, we don't have any lectures.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_03
 But I think we have a lot of classes.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think there was an official one last semester.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_02
 I think it was just a bad call.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_00
 Something like that.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_01
 I think one of the classes did.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_01
 Some classes did.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_01
 We should have picked up.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_03
 I think the undergraduates had a word.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_00
 It was up to the professor.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_00
 I don't feel like it.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a good thing.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_00
 I think the DIL will probably have one to make up for missing classes.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_00
 What?

0:34:01	SPEAKER_00
 DIL.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_00
 We'll probably have one.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_03
 It's been another last week.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_02
 It's me Monday.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_03
 I guess that's it.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_03
 Was there anything else?

0:34:17	SPEAKER_03
 Do anyone know you want to take care of this or should I take care of it?

0:34:21	SPEAKER_01
 We trust you.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if there was something I think he basically said.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_03
 The same thing as in the comments.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_03
 If I could read it.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe that.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_00
 On the top one.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_00
 Do you really want multiple windows from a single app?

0:34:49	SPEAKER_00
 But most will probably want to go with the faults.

0:34:53	None
 Yeah.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_03
 That was for the same.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_01
 I think it comments basically the same as what you said.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_00
 Just the other comment about whether you want to do both speaker characterization and topics of intention.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_00
 So, yeah.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_00
 That's right.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_03
 And now we have 7% of the course already.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_03
 That's right.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_03
 That's right.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_02
 So, we need to take the okay box right?

0:35:19	SPEAKER_02
 If you're okay with it having.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_03
 It's like buzzing.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_01
 Signing off.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, God.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_02
 Should we turn these off?

0:35:33	SPEAKER_03
 We're done now.

0:35:39	SPEAKER_03
 Is she still here?

0:35:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, you are.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:47	None
 Yeah.

0:35:51	None
 Yeah.

0:35:56	None
 Yeah.

0:36:01	None
 Yeah.
