0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so we moved it over and on to the other eye link.

0:00:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I mean she's running it.

0:00:05	SPEAKER_04
 My view on this was that the need for people to back up their data personally was made sufficiently clear to lab users.

0:00:12	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I guess.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_04
 Did it miss it?

0:00:15	SPEAKER_04
 Right, okay.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_04
 As long as you miss it, then that's fine.

0:00:18	SPEAKER_04
 I'm just thinking, you know, sometimes when there's a process error like that, you think of them, then there's something you should change, like make the sign in bigger red letters.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_04
 But in our case, I don't think there's anything more we can do really.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I doubt anybody will do that again because that'll get around.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, it's a joke and worry.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we'll go the mailing list out now.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, there's a mailing list.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_04
 No, I don't know.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, there wasn't a mailing list before.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_04
 They just revived that, right?

0:00:45	SPEAKER_01
 Frank went through it, deleted the people that were going or whatever and replaced.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_01
 So the list is now updated.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, so everyone that list has now been reminded.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, don't store anything sensitive on anything you care about on the list.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_04
 And we don't know.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_04
 So there's every chance of this falling over again if it's a hardware thing.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_06
 There's not much we can do about that apart from.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I did do hard drive check and memory check and it says there's no problems.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_06
 But something caused it to go wrong in the first place.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_06
 We don't know.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_06
 We don't know.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_06
 Things are exponential, check for free.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_06
 We don't know the answer.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_06
 Thank you.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you so much.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_01
 We've been thinking about.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_01
 We've been talking about.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_01
 Rosam I heard followed by a single announcement today, and consequently, the first sounded out of thebox,

0:01:47	SPEAKER_06
 and we can realize that the first testament to how much this goes forth. and get that tested out and that'll be, I think that's everything we need before we can start wearing the experiments.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_04
 And I saw a bunch of stuff about software updates that's unrelated to this problem, right?

0:02:00	SPEAKER_04
 You mean from the island? I didn't read and myself like five messages go back and forth.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe they were under the wrong subject header.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_01
 So anyway, we have one thing over the last week.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_01
 Jule has produced another version of the model builder. Oh, no, I mean the island software.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_01
 That was a few weeks ago. So it's unrelated. It's not that.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_04
 It's unrelated. Okay, good.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_01
 And was running because Frank did all that because he then had an experiment.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_01
 So he's run an experiment.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_04
 So did he get his data? Is this put his schedule back?

0:02:40	SPEAKER_01
 He's done his econics.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_01
 And he backs up.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_04
 Well, unfortunate, but it sounds like you guys are well placed for dealing with it.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_04
 Better you than me.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_06
 But I'm not going to be well pleased.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I'd imagine you get things working on Monday.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_06
 So everything went down on Tuesday morning.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_06
 So I managed to get everything working on Monday to show that JCT was actually working, collaborating between two machines.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_06
 I didn't know it wasn't actually, I didn't know where I had the iTrack and stuff working.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_06
 It was just me running around running around the lab.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_06
 So I have the ones that are reinstalled, I have to actually do a proper pilot.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_04
 So you need to borrow somebody's head and mouth and stuff to run it.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_06
 But it looks like it was doing all the calibration and drift correction and things that they had and was wanting on it.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_06
 So that doesn't mean anything to add to the software for that part.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_04
 So I've got a new trainee who might need amusement at some point.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_04
 So if you need to borrow a head that talks that doesn't necessarily need to do much else, I'll ask her if she's mind coming down and helping you out for a while.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_04
 But I guess Ellen is going to be your...

0:03:51	SPEAKER_04
 The person?

0:03:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, but she's not ringed.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_04
 So mine is...well, she's actually climbing Ben Nettis today, I think.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_04
 But she'll be back tomorrow.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_04
 Her name's Ninka.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_04
 Did you guys meet her?

0:04:09	SPEAKER_06
 I don't think so.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_01
 This is a song I'm familiar with.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_04
 I might find him using to look at.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_04
 So I'll see if she'd be willing to...

0:04:22	SPEAKER_01
 I did meet someone from another project of yours on Wednesday evening.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, who's that Heidi?

0:04:30	SPEAKER_01
 Heidi.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah, Heidi.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_01
 And gesture.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah, she's good.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_04
 You guys might actually have something in common because she does...well, you know, stuff in video coding and gesture.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:04:40	None
 And autism.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_04
 I know.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:04:44	SPEAKER_04
 Right, what am I waiting?

0:04:49	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, Ninka Devol She's been volunteered.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_04
 Well, no, I will actually give her the option, but it sounds like the kind of thing where, you know, it's quite useful when you're at that stage to see the different kinds of technologies people use.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_06
 Yes, we're trying to get Camtasia up and running so I can try out when we've got her coming in.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_06
 We're just sort of doing a bunch of a proper pilot just to...

0:05:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, make sure it starts and finishes when it's meant to and that sort of thing is well.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_06
 Yep.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I'll make sure they can actually pick up the audio signal as well.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, but the audio signal should be coming out to speakers once it's out properly, so I should make that slightly easier.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, the bleep was a hardware bleep originally, and so it comes from the PC, which is outside the same group box.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_01
 Oops!

0:05:42	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you found that then.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_06
 But, yes, the unfortunate is because on the mitre's inside the room, so it's long and what I've done, I'm just going to set up.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_06
 So, whatever the asterisk stand is and windows is what gets played.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_06
 So, you can just change the sound to whatever you like, just through the Windows control panel.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so we want one, you can pick up using MATLAB or something, right?

0:06:09	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, so I'll have that running over the weekend.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_06
 So, last week I tried it with a 1 kilohertz sound, and it was, it could detect it, but it wasn't very clear.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_06
 Did it with 10 kilohertz and it's just really clear.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_06
 We can tell exactly where the bleep is.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_06
 Perfect.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_06
 So, yeah, so that is just a matter of, yeah, you're just basically just play a 10 kilohertz sound over the speech and then just compare the two signals basically.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_06
 So, I've got a little script for doing it.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_04
 Perfect.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_04
 So, you're going to bank the script someplace.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_03
 Because we won't know.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that sounds good.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_03
 What else?

0:06:45	SPEAKER_01
 You have altered the task program, if you say to put the little i icon and the mouse.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, the one, the one in just install should have that now.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_06
 We'll double check on my install on the, on the, on the tracking machines, but yeah, it should, it should be updated without now.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_01
 Rather than just a blob, everyone wanted something look more like an i so that you, that was the i.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, really?

0:07:14	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, okay.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_06
 So, so we've got like a big circle with a white circle in the middle of an i and they've got like a rectangle with two like rectangle buttons on it.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, okay.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_04
 So.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_04
 Very nice.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_04
 Very, very pretty.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't get in the way of seeing what's underneath.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_06
 And the same size as the original is basically.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_06
 I think the mouse is slightly bigger, but it's not.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's not hugely bigger.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_04
 Uh huh.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_04
 I can see where that's useful.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_06
 And if it gets a very problem in the pilot, I can easily reduce the size of whatever.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_01
 That's not too hard.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_01
 I want a reasonable size so that if they're looking at it, we know they're looking at it.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_01
 So, yeah, it has to be a reasonable target for the tracking purposes.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_04
 Although if you had a big thing and it was jiggling around like anybody's business like real life track cases, then you might find that a little bit disconcerting.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, small things you kind of expected you go around.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I suppose a larger.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_01
 Or oscillation appears.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_01
 It's not that mean it isn't that big.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_02
 It's like it's quiver.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that's all fine.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_04
 What else?

0:08:28	SPEAKER_04
 You're saying Joe with a model builder.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, he's produced in another version that doesn't have the overlap.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_01
 Problem.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yes.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the collision.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_01
 So, polygons now do it.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that's good.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_01
 Marlow's discovered something strange about the orientation of parallel grams from when it was constructed to when it appears in the.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_01
 Actual task, but I think that might be something to do with the original.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_01
 Configuration in the parts that weren't the same across the two.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_01
 So check that out to see if it really is a problem or not.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, basically the parallel gram was appearing in a sort of mirror image of what it was like in the model builder.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_01
 Really?

0:09:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_01
 Just totally flipped in a mirror image, not rotated.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_01
 So it wasn't anything to do with rotation.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_01
 Just with parallel gram.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, just the panel.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 So, not entirely sure.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_01
 It must be some way of how the vertices were described or defined in one way compared to something else.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_04
 So your job in this is to ensure that it actually is a bug and then pass it to Joe.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_04
 That makes sense.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, this geometry stuff is really tricky if you don't do the full box of stuff in your head well.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_04
 Imagine.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I could get it backwards easily.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_04
 You know, so it is just a small thing.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 The other thing we've done is looked at.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_01
 Not for this current experiment, but for future when we've got to build bizarre parts like aircraft wings and things.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_01
 Something like X fig can output the vertex points.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_01
 The actual polygons in the first place is a motor builder assumes that there's an existing safety.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_01
 So you need to draw them in first place.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_04
 So, yeah, I suggested you do that next big.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_04
 Is that a reasonable thing to do?

0:10:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_06
 So you can do the next big export them as SVG.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_06
 You just get a list of X, Y coordinate.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_06
 And then I'll just run a little script that turns out X, Y coordinate into a part.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_04
 So this falls down completely if nine Megan can't run X fig.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_04
 So you better check that with them.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_06
 Well, something SVG.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_06
 So, as long as that's something that will output SVG.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_04
 But they may need help finding the something that they can't do as big as those.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_06
 So I'll have a look at that.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_06
 But there must be plenty of windows things.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_03
 But like SVG.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_06
 Some.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_04
 I know.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_04
 I know.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_06
 Well, I know Adobe and things have packages that do it.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_06
 But obviously they're like a few of the package.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_06
 But I'll be very surprised.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_06
 I have a feeling that the Amaya, the W3C browser does it have a feeling that can actually edit SVG files.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_04
 So I wouldn't do any work to try and find that.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_04
 What will output SVG just ask them, look, you know, say you need something that does SVG.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_04
 And then if they if they come back and say, huh, then you may need to put it around a bit.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_04
 And then look at it for something.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_04
 You know, let them, let them say they've got a problem before you have spent time trying to figure out what will do it.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_01
 It's not an immediate problem anyway.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_01
 But I thought it was worth, before it would disappear, it's just checking that the model builder is not restricted to just doing the 10 grams or something.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_01
 So, no, it does look.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_04
 It's a.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, so, well, I can imagine there being shapes that you could construct in SVG format that would fox the model building some way.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, because you don't have specs about what sorts of shapes are allowed, right?

0:12:12	SPEAKER_01
 No, but as long as there's solid polygons, it should be right.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't matter whether they're convex or concave in 20 ways.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_01
 Well, hopefully that's not what the panelal gram problem is.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_01
 It does.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 Some of the bangles and things.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's.

0:12:31	None
 Yeah.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_06
 I'd create a, I'd create a convex part and just the next big.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_06
 And you tried it.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_06
 It just happened to be a convex part that I was playing with.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_06
 It hadn't allowed to be.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_06
 It didn't have any self intersections.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_06
 So that might be a problem.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_06
 So I'll have to check that.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_04
 Would we want by self intersection, you mean.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, but by part, the cross is over itself.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_01
 You mean like, so that's why we're, no, we'll only be working to see with sort of solid obvious polygons.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_01
 This point is, yeah, yeah, you have to have a central point anyway for rotation.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_01
 But myself intersection here.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_04
 I'll draw here.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_04
 I can find the right end of the pen.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_04
 Do you mean something like that?

0:13:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_04
 And you can rule out something like that.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's two parts.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 I would consider that two parts.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, you know, some rainy day.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_04
 You might want to think about.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I don't know.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_00
 Later on, we can fix it.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_04
 If it turns out those parts, it's not urgent now.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_04
 I think this is important enough.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_06
 So for now, we'll just assume they're non-insecting.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_06
 And yeah, that was a, the SVD stuff can act for ones which aren't closed polygons.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_06
 But once you, once I actually have to turn up in the parts list, it creates a closed polygon by just by linking them into this point.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_01
 Last point to that.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_06
 So, yeah.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_06
 So it's long, it's long there.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_06
 So the song, the, the, the, the drawing well enough, it should be all right.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_06
 Uh-huh.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_06
 Well, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, let nine Megan find it, find an SVG.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_04
 So it finds like the SVG and then we'll see if there's any problems.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_04
 But if they have trouble, you know, half an hour of googling and helping, helping them is probably worthwhile.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_04
 Sometimes people, I mean, actually I would, I wouldn't expect them to have any trouble finding something because JPs quite up without a lot of it.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_02
 So.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_06
 Well, it might worth just checking what software they are using because it might create, it might create outputs slightly different from X-fig.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_04
 Well, let's encourage them not to use any software that might have idiosyncratic ideas about what SVG is.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_04
 She says delicately.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_04
 The Microsoft version of this.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_01
 I can hear something.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_01
 That I wasn't going to say.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_04
 I have no idea whether they have video, some credit, SVG output or whatever.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_04
 But the track, the track record on some of the other standards has not, they have been slightly strange things about it.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_04
 But am I a, you know, I mean, that should be.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_06
 That should be fun.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_06
 I think it does SVG, SVG output.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_06
 And so I can easily double check if my main can find anything.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_04
 I haven't looked through other mail.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_04
 I did see something from my lose.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_04
 Is there anything they're waiting on from us that is a problem or they're reasonably happy at the moment?

0:15:28	SPEAKER_01
 I think they're not waiting anything from us.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_01
 They've dumped the pilot, the pilot studies that they generated based on the task with their English participants.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, they're just the pilots.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, good.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_01
 But they haven't done anything with it other than dump the data.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_01
 Where is it?

0:15:49	SPEAKER_01
 Well, they dumped it on the.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_01
 You know, you server, but I moved, well, I've moved it.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_01
 I copied it onto the.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's a day.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_04
 You know, we're not using that much space.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_04
 If it's just very interim, and they have to get it to us somewhere.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_04
 We had a brief discussion just before I left about this idea of exchanging data by firewire drive.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_04
 And I don't know if that ever got resolved.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_01
 Nothing further is.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_04
 You know, that's not that's not fast enough for little things like this.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_04
 I think we see W is the right way to exchange these.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_04
 We just have to wipe this stuff off and separate copies after that.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_01
 And I've seen the thing off tomorrow.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_01
 I was trying to encourage her again to register for the CSB.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_01
 This is what the CVS and what to do and the software I use.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_01
 It seems to be quite easy.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, so you're managing that.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_04
 And you haven't run into CVS before.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_01
 No, as in yes, it's new and no.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's that's for you.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_01
 So far.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_01
 Of course he's sitting on the next desk.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_01
 And I am just using it through a Windows bolt on.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_01
 So piece of software.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_06
 That was easy to install.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_06
 I wasn't.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_01
 I'll switch forward and then you can take stuff out the wiki.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_01
 Right click things and the Windows Explorer.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_01
 That's it.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_04
 Well, she'll have to use the CVS eventually because we don't really have a good way of doing this otherwise.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_06
 And I was saying I was doing a double check and I got what could access the CVS from home when I worked with my own last week.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_06
 Well, Thursday, I'm actually going to get in and just check the stuff and make sure it was all, make sure I could access it.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_06
 So they shouldn't have any trouble accessing it once they've got to log in.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_04
 Well, that's it.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_04
 We'll never see him here again.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_02
 And a deal like this.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_02
 I feel like that he's got a better computer at home as well.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_00
 Not yet.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_04
 And what about the project as a whole?

0:17:58	SPEAKER_04
 Is there anything that will do?

0:18:00	SPEAKER_04
 Anybody who's after that we aren't supplying?

0:18:03	SPEAKER_01
 Nope.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_01
 Not at the moment.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_01
 The only thing that's been going around is the version of the flyer.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know what real purpose of these little folded up E-4 flyers.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_04
 They're critical to the successful project.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_04
 So.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_01
 Are they just for distribution at conferences?

0:18:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_04
 And general places.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_04
 But yeah, I wouldn't worry too much about it.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I'm not really bothered.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_01
 But that's what's circulating.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_01
 That's what's circulating.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_01
 The group is a hall at the moment.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_01
 Uh-huh.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_01
 I've sorted out travel, et cetera, to Munich.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_01
 Erwin, Joanna, myself.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_01
 We're all off on the 14th of December.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_01
 Going back on the pregnancy.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_01
 And John's going.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, that's good.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_04
 It'll be useful for the WQ-7 steps.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_04
 Well, while you do that, I'll be trained in how to hire people.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_01
 So that's weak.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_01
 How to hire or how to interview.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_05
 Uh, both.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_04
 So, so, is there anything else?

0:19:16	SPEAKER_04
 What have you gone on for the rest of the week besides getting this stuff up and running again?

0:19:21	SPEAKER_06
 Uh, well once I've tried out the camp day just stuff.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_06
 If there's any problems, go to the grocery and fix them.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_06
 There's any problems next I'm working on is the GDF stuff.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_06
 So I've put on a DTV and some of Lexum L file on the wiki for the GDF.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_06
 So based on some stuff you put on the GDF specification.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_04
 So are you concerned about it that I should be looking at it or are you happy with it?

0:19:44	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I sort of wrote the initial draft of it, I suppose.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I changed a couple of things from your original draft.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_06
 So there's no longer a separate thing for creating new parts.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_06
 So I just put a start and end time on each part.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_06
 So you had a think of, I think it was mold or something you said, which is sort of to create a new part.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_06
 It was an action to create a new part.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_06
 But I gave each part a start time and an end time.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_06
 So you can see when the parts were created.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_06
 So I'm not sure if you want to keep the mold or not.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_04
 I'll have to look, I can't remember how this works now because that was a while ago.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_06
 It's just the GDF specification page on the wiki.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_06
 I'm trying to put in justification for the change that I made on the page.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_06
 I've sent it out for review.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_06
 So that's anyone who is going to be using the format can have a look at it.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and you'll get nothing back unless I look at it.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_04
 So best for me to do that.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I mean, it's really good that you're putting things out for review and saying like why for stuff.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_04
 But we also don't want to burn too much of your time recording stuff that nobody's ever going to look at necessarily.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_04
 So I mean, this might be a good case, or it might be that you should just talk to me about the stuff if I happen to be around at the time that you're doing it and not.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_04
 So if the running stuff down on the wiki gets to be too high a proportion of things, then you don't necessarily want to do it.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_04
 You know what I mean?

0:21:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_04
 So I think it's great to have the records.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_04
 And that's really important, especially in big dispersed groups.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_04
 But this is kind of a smaller group.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_04
 So we can do things more informally where you feel the wiki's getting in the way of things.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, well, the one that's saying it this time, it was helpful for me to put it up on the wiki because I could actually think about it as I put it up and say, well, this is why I want to do things this way.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_04
 Well, if it ain't you in thinking to write it down, then definitely write it down.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_04
 Because we want clear thinking.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_04
 I can't actually remember how it worked with the notes.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_04
 I wanted to make sure that, no, I can't even remember.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_04
 So I'll look at them.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, fair enough.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_04
 But I'm sure it's fine.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_04
 It's just my memory, please.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_01
 And I'll have to get to groups with Camtasia properly to generate both of introductory video, I suppose, for instructional purposes at the beginning of the experiment.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_01
 So people will be able to see.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_01
 And so the example movements and things like that.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_04
 So is that going to have a voiceover?

0:22:37	SPEAKER_04
 Or is it?

0:22:38	SPEAKER_04
 We had discussions before you started about whether it should be completely silent so that they could use, in case we ever wanted to do this in Dutch as well.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_04
 In Dutch, yeah.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_04
 And so you could just have sort of, well, I think we discussed having it with an English voiceover or having it with no voiceover and then having it just with cartoon noises or something like boof.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_01
 You know, when things break.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that was the bean before me.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_06
 So I made the imagine.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_06
 Well, I know Camtasia.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_06
 If you've got a Camtasia project, you can have the video and audio separately.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_04
 And which piece?

0:23:14	SPEAKER_04
 And so we could produce a Dutch voiceover for the same thing.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_06
 So we just did the Dutch show you the video and our audio.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_06
 And then make an easy crate.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_01
 They're audio out of.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 So I mean, I don't think it'd be more since we'll just do the video part of it first.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_01
 And then you add the voiceover afterwards.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_01
 Trying to do all at once.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_04
 The other issue is if we do a voiceover, does that affect the language that the people choose to use?

0:23:44	SPEAKER_01
 So that would be another reason for not doing that.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_01
 Anything with the voice.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_01
 You know, if you start talking about a lot of the points.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, talking about the parts is just naming them or anything like that.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_04
 So I think maybe that was another reason for just having boof.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's OK.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_01
 Or do you know no noise?

0:24:07	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's probably.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_01
 Or ding.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_01
 Or you know, you got it.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_01
 Or I don't know what.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_01
 Probably actually not even the sound effects, because otherwise they'll expect that in the real experiment.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_01
 And that doesn't happen.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_01
 So if they make a move a piece and it breaks and they don't hear this crash, they go, what's, you know, what's happened?

0:24:26	SPEAKER_01
 Is that really what happened?

0:24:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_04
 Well, you need some way to make sure that they actually notice the thing you're trying to explain to them if there's no voice.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_06
 Well, one thing that can do, you can have little videos than other than if you've got any cameras we're doing that, where you can have videos with people click on the masons or whatever else.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_04
 Or you could just point to have a great big arrow that points at the two pieces that block.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so I think you can generate.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, you can generate callouts and whatever.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_06
 So yeah, I'm sure there must be a way of putting big arrows or whatever.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_04
 So you're going to clear however you do this without one, right?

0:25:08	SPEAKER_04
 Because she's one that has thoughts about the language stuff.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_01
 But in our discussion, we haven't mentioned it.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_01
 It was assumed to be a voice of it.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_01
 But.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we might know that there was a question about one of the wrong things.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'll do that.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, because we've got to think of these instructions and basic introductions with all as well.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_01
 Actually, I did email my meeting to ask if they had a say of instructions they'd given their participants.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_01
 I thought my list just talked to them.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_01
 Probably.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_01
 I suspect so, because I haven't had a reply back.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's very up to us too.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, to do me to it was just in case they had something that.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_04
 Is it hard?

0:25:50	SPEAKER_04
 You don't want to give them the specification, you know, because that's too high for the language.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_04
 But it can't be that hard to generate something that says.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_01
 No, I ship him.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_01
 I'll just move forward enough, I think.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, on my holidays, we encountered a children's truss shop where there were 10 grams.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_04
 And my son reminded me that he hasn't been able to find his 10 grams.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_04
 All right, you want to give back?

0:26:24	SPEAKER_05
 Well, not if you guys are using it.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_01
 Do you find me helpful to have?

0:26:29	SPEAKER_01
 Well, actually, I could probably just put it over the manual.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, but it's so tactile to have little metal bits.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_04
 If you're using it, keep it.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_04
 He's got plenty of toys.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_04
 If you're not using it, then I'll take it back.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_01
 Hopefully, well, hopefully you did more than another week or two anyway.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_01
 As long as you can hold off.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_04
 It's not a worry.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_04
 The lab has plenty of toys.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_01
 I'm looking at the complexity aspect of the 10 grams in that booklet.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_01
 It's not quite that they just get harder.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_01
 They kind of have pages of similar types.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, similar types, uh-huh.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so one page you'll have parts that are kind of similar to each other and then you move over a different type of design style.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_01
 It's not quite as progressive in complexity.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_04
 Right, so how are you going to get your complexity ratings?

0:27:29	SPEAKER_04
 Google.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_01
 Google?

0:27:31	SPEAKER_04
 Is there a big 10 gram community that ranks these things?

0:27:35	SPEAKER_04
 Like, you know, that's just one booklet that came with one set

0:27:37	SPEAKER_01
 of 10 grams. Uh, I'll try.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_01
 I'll try.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_01
 I never know what it's worth saying.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_01
 Or is it obvious, like, when you look at these things?

0:27:45	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I'm hoping the Dutch input will allow us to sort of have a rough idea of what this, uh, of a suitable complexity for the task.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_04
 But that still won't tell you, well, how many 10 grams are there that they're using?

0:28:02	SPEAKER_04
 15 or something?

0:28:03	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_01
 No, not even that.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_01
 The relevant type to what we're wanting to use, probably three.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_01
 Uh-huh.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_04
 We've to generate 16 in total.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_04
 So that's not going to tell you anything about relative complexity.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_04
 That's just going to tell you where in the span, you want to be.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_04
 You still need some kind of scale for these things.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, ideally.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_04
 If you look at them, do you just know?

0:28:26	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I don't.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_03
 What about him?

0:28:32	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_03
 Mr Geometry.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_04
 Can you tell us by looking at these?

0:28:37	SPEAKER_04
 How hard do people find them?

0:28:39	SPEAKER_06
 I wouldn't know.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I'll try the Google and see if there's, uh, if there are some sort of ranking sites.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_04
 Who in psychology already uses 10 grams that's still around?

0:28:54	SPEAKER_04
 People have been using 10 grams for ages, so there must be somebody with a folk wisdom you can contact.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_01
 I'll try and find out.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_04
 I only know ancient papers, so like late 80s.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_01
 Do people still use 10 grams?

0:29:08	SPEAKER_01
 Um, I've not encountered them.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, so we're very old fashioned.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_01
 Uh, maybe they just don't use anything like that.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_04
 Well, there was stuff in the 70s and the 80s, right?

0:29:23	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if anything's happened since then.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_04
 Wow.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_04
 The old past is the best.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_04
 So I'm not going to let that worry you.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_04
 Um, so, uh, sorry.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_04
 I was, I think a big diversion and we were talking about what you were going to do next after all this stuff was up and I was going to look at the GDF spec.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_04
 Uh, the rest of the, uh, is the rest of what you to do with that software fairly clear?

0:29:55	SPEAKER_04
 Because this is about the analysis.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_04
 You really only need Robin, right?

0:30:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_06
 A lot of us who are going to rob and what analysis we need to get out of the GDF format.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_06
 Um, so I'm going to basic, I've got the, the just analyzer's got the basis for, uh, um, the gdf, um, so what I'm going to do is actually create an output, uh, a GDF output part to it, um, because the moment, uh, any outputs, the video, um, but it does have internal structures will make it easy to do the XML.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_06
 So that's what we're going to look at.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_06
 And then once I've done that, I can look at the whatever analysis we need to get done out of the GDF.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_04
 Cause there were all these issues about how you calculate II lag and, you know, what are the analyses we want out of this that aren't settled.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_04
 I think, um, you know, Robin is the person who knows the most about what's required there.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_04
 And I could imagine it's going to take a little while.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_04
 I can imagine, you know, so that might be the focus of discussions next week or something.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_01
 But, um, you need to get out of this and pull, pull in parameters and choose the right seconds.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_04
 So you might want to try and come, if you get that far, try and come and put a list of the kinds of things you want out of it and see what it looks like.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_04
 Alan might have to use all kinds of things once we have a list.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm sure you'll have views on it.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_04
 So, but it'd be good to, you know, make sure once we have a list of the things that we think we're getting out of it, that it matches her intentions for what we were supposed to get out of it.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_04
 So, um, you know, if we do talk about that, then it might be nice to have her along for it.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_01
 Um, oh, I found, I haven't found it physically yet, but a reference to a 92 paper.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_01
 It's the royal proceedings of something or other somewhere based on an experiment that had blocks, a model blocks of parts, and then an area where people had to build, you know, replicate the model.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_01
 Just one person at a time, of course, but it did involve high movements and monitoring where they're looking compared to the hand movements.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_01
 Who was that then?

0:32:06	SPEAKER_01
 Ballard.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_04
 Back in 92.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_01
 Are they still on the business?

0:32:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_01
 I think so.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_01
 Where are they?

0:32:14	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_04
 Wow.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_04
 They might have the focus on the complexity, right?

0:32:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_04
 I need to use that that long.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_01
 So, she's still working well.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_01
 Is it a paper you can get?

0:32:34	SPEAKER_01
 That's what I'll have to try and play notes.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_04
 Well, they still do it for library loans and stuff.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_01
 So, if not, the national library has been packed.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_04
 Uh huh.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yep.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_04
 So, do we think next week that's what we're going to talk about?

0:32:52	SPEAKER_04
 Because we don't want to ask everyone ahead of time if she wants to come along for a discussion

0:32:56	SPEAKER_01
 about. She's not here next week anyway.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, well.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_01
 That's, that's fine.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_01
 It's next Wednesday or Thursday, of course, it's back.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_04
 Cause she, her stuff is getting blocked off the mailing list because she's now mailing from her normal account.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, is that what, yeah, she's got a Yahoo account or something.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_04
 And I can't figure out any way to just approve messages from her without her subscribing at that account.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_04
 So.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, well, it's a thing something getting through.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_01
 There's only one message so far.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_04
 It didn't say much.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_01
 Anything else?

0:33:40	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I'll get, get working on the campaign stuff this week.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_06
 And then, so once, once we've got some, some idea about what nasty you want out of this, I can think about whether the PDF's got everything we need in it.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_06
 And yeah, what an answer.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_01
 There's the provisional list of what we need on the wiki anyway.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_06
 So I'll double check the PDF specification against that just to make sure it's got everything.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_04
 You say, you need from that.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I don't think that list is our final word on things.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I added things to it.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, well, maybe it is.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't know when you last looked at it.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_01
 But when I added it was something in the last two weeks, anything.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think it was fully thing.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I'm not going to have views on this anyway.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_04
 What I'm really worried about is making sure that there's no big surprises for Ellen and JP, you know, when they suddenly discover that there are some analysis in there and we didn't get it in, you know, because now is the time for us to be figuring out what we want out of that data and getting you right to stuff or getting JP to write the one dimensional analysis that we used to have.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_06
 The theme and we've got all the data in the ASCII format at the moment.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_06
 And just no matter what data we need to pull out of that into the GDF so we can actually do the proper analysis.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_06
 And I think all the assets are going to run off the GDF format.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_06
 Because we've decided that if we look at the dynamic regions and whatever else it has to

0:35:04	SPEAKER_01
 be, the regions that I think might cause a bit of trouble.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_06
 Which is what we have to do off the GDF and the post of the EDF format.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, right.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_04
 So actually you're breaking this down into two steps now.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_04
 One is just straight extraction from the ASCII and the other one is any post analysis that adds information by analyzing it.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_06
 Is that?

0:35:28	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_06
 So the stuff on the EDF such as the ASCII file and things like the mass movements and things like that.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_04
 So just anything that's got shoved through the ITRAP.

0:35:39	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_06
 And then on top of that, GDF can also have information such as right at this point in time they were looking at the new parts area or they were going to have the target.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_04
 That is post analysis.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_06
 So yeah.

0:35:51	SPEAKER_06
 So the other is the GDF is going to have that sort of information in it.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_06
 And then also because it's an XML file we can then do the accessibility or whatever onto it to extract whatever bits of data you need for.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_06
 So that all sounds good.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_04
 So I've got one thing to check and one person to ask if she'll volunteer to be ahead.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_04
 And as far as I know that's it for me.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_04
 See, I have to explain.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_04
 For one of my other things.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_04
 There's now a specific wiki page that says stuff gene has to do.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_04
 At the beginning of the picture, this is quite a good idea because I worry about that doing stuff people expect it to be much more than the other way around.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_01
 I think according to the latest documentation, you're down for 5% of your 15 months on this project or something.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_01
 What documentation?

0:36:45	SPEAKER_01
 Some jazz report.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, okay.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_01
 Officially.

0:36:49	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it doesn't actually make its way into its my salary.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_04
 In reality.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_04
 So.

0:36:55	None
 Right.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I mean, I just spent time talking to you guys.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_04
 So.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_04
 You get something out of me.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:37:26	None
 Okay.

0:37:41	None
 Okay.

0:38:06	None
 Okay.

0:38:21	None
