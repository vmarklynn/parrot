0:00:00	None
 get started.

0:00:22	SPEAKER_02
 So, nice to see you again.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_02
 So, for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_02
 So we will see our free presentations.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_02
 We will start with the manager expert.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_02
 We will talk about user requirements, what user needs and what is desired for this device.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, can I have the laptop over here?

0:01:17	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I don't think so.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, I have to get up.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_02
 I think it should stay in this meeting.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, okay.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_00
 So, basically I am going to present some findings of a study we conducted into what users want in this remote control.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_00
 So, first of all, what we did is we conducted an experiment with 100 test subjects.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_00
 We put them in our usability laboratory and got them to play with remote controls and also after they have done that to complete a questionnaire to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_00
 So, basically the major things we found out was that basically users don't like the look and feel of most remote controls that are currently on the market.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_00
 They, you know, 75% of the people we did the experiments on found that remote controls that they used in the past were completely ugly.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_00
 They didn't match the operating behaviour of the user.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_00
 That is, you know, the way users use remote controls when they are watching TV, that the layout of the remote controls didn't match the way they used it.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_00
 And thirdly they say that half of the users that we tested said that they only used 10% of the buttons that are on remote controls.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_00
 So, we also collected some users statistics based on how these test subjects were using their remote control.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_00
 And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons, the channel selection buttons are the most, by far, the most used buttons on the remote control.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_00
 And you can see they used 168 times per hour on average while the user is watching TV.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_00
 The closest button that was used, the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button, which was used 14 times per hour, followed by the volume button, which was 4 times per hour.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_00
 All the other buttons such as audio and picture selection configuration buttons and things were used less than or equal to 1 times per hour.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_00
 We also asked users which buttons had the most importance to them, which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on the remote control.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_00
 And basically they said the channel volume and power buttons had the highest relevance to users.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_00
 Note the only power was very infrequently used.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_00
 It only had a usage frequency of about 1 times per hour, but users ranked it as having a very, very high relevance.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_00
 And the audio and picture settings had a very, well, the users thought that the audio and picture settings weren't very important to them, and they used them very infrequently as well.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_00
 So we asked users what frustrates them the most about current remote controls.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_00
 And 50% of the users said that what frustrates them is losing their remote control, somewhere in the room and not being able to find it.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_00
 They also said that it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control, especially when there's many buttons and it's an unintuitive interface.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_00
 And then thirdly, some users commented on the fact that the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control are bad and cause repetitive strain injury.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_00
 We also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the remote control, in particular, do they want an LCD display?

0:06:11	SPEAKER_00
 And secondly, do they think speech recognition is a useful feature to have on our remote control?

0:06:18	SPEAKER_00
 Basically, our findings are that amongst younger age groups, the answer is overwhelmingly yes, they want these features, they want these high technology features.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_00
 For instance, 91% of people aged between 15 and 25 said yes, they want these features, whereas the trend was as users became older and older, they were less likely to want these features in a remote control.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_00
 So I guess it depends on where we're focusing out our market.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_00
 And as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics, I think we're focusing on the younger target demographic.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_00
 And so maybe we should think about adding these high technology features into our remote control.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_00
 That's my presentation, thank you.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe now we can talk about user interface and about technical function of this device.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_02
 So Peter, can you talk about something about that?

0:07:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, yeah, but you think I'm using this.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_01
 I'm using it.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry, I'm sorry.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_01
 If I could go there.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_01
 This, okay.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_03
 You're scaring me with LCD man.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_03
 And speech recognition in real-o-tunate will be very expensive.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's true, but you know, the features that users want.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_00
 And our production cost of 1250 euros per unit is fairly high, I think.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_00
 So I think we can afford to add these sort of features into our remote.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_03
 At least we have a couple of months to work on it, so it will be cheaper by the way.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_03
 It's true.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_01
 There's D-H, but...

0:08:34	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I hope I'm...

0:08:59	SPEAKER_00
 That's the wrong one, I think.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's still more...

0:09:04	SPEAKER_02
 Presentation tree?

0:09:05	SPEAKER_02
 Because you should have put yes.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yes.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yes.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so here is my presentation about technical function design.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_01
 I will talk about different components of system and how they react together.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_01
 First, what is the remote control?

0:09:36	SPEAKER_01
 Simply device, as you know, for sending some commands by some waves to another device to tell different commands with this device.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_01
 And the main idea is we don't use any cable and we can react simpler with the device.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_01
 It has different blocks, different blocks.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_01
 First, this remote control should have some electric circuits, making interface with keyboards and reading the keyboard commands and then make these keyboard commands, interpret these keyboard commands, and then there should be an electronic circuit making electronic signals according to these commands.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_01
 And finally, there is a transmitter which is a cord or a diode making waves to transmit through the air and this wave will be received by the other device like a television or whatever to realize their command.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_01
 About what I found about these different blocks are usually there are two different metals for designing a remote control.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_01
 They are based on infrared waves or radio waves.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_01
 There are two different solutions.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_01
 This can be the differences between different kind of waves, infrared or radio waves.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_01
 And also, as I understood and I think it was a part of the presentation, people prefer to have remote control with less bottom.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_01
 So for the electronic part working and interfacing with buttons, we should try to design a remote control, having some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons just to search between different options and showing something on TV and putting less stuff on the remote control.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_01
 And personal preferences are certainly a remote control with working with radio waves is preferred because you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_01
 And again, using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_01
 As I see. Okay. That was my presentation.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_00
 I have a question.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_00
 Do you think radio waves will interfere with other appliances in the home?

0:12:53	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think so because we can make this wave in a specific frequency.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_01
 So they can be in a range which is not interfering with other devices inside the home.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_02
 Can we use any frequency? We have the right to use any frequency?

0:13:14	SPEAKER_01
 No, but as I know there is a range for this stuff, for designing this circuit.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_01
 We can tune our transmitter to work in this range.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_01
 For this range, we don't need to ask any permission.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. And what happens with radio waves when two neighbors have the same remote control, for example?

0:13:40	SPEAKER_02
 Do they have the same frequency?

0:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 For this, I don't know the solution, but one solution can be something like putting a password or something inside the wave.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_01
 So only your team can understand identification.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_03
 But since it's exactly my feel so, it's kind of hand shaking when you start to communicate with your TV.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_03
 It's like hand shaking protocol with your remote.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_03
 So if two devices are trying to communicate with the TV set, then the one which has more energy in the wave is chosen.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_03
 This can be a problem sometimes, but most of the time it works okay.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_01
 The task force may simply or identification code may simply solve this problem, a specific remote control.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but we don't have to think about this because I think as a function designer that we will use the already made circuits, which we probably buy its words to buy, and they have these problems solved.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_03
 So we don't have to think about these.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe you can talk about the function.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, I have only a couple of things because I had struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this company.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_03
 I was used to use Linux before, but I tried to break through this.

0:15:29	None
 Yes.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_03
 So I will speak about working design.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_03
 That's the first slide.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so presently I'm looking what is possible to use, what circuits to use and stuff like that because I didn't work with these circuits so far.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_03
 So I have to look what is available on the market for the communication for the IR circuits and so on.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm currently looking what is available on the web and I wanted to ask you maybe afterwards after our discussion if we have some contacts in some company, which can report on what is going on there.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_03
 So I would be glad if you can tell me about that.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, findings, that's the point that I'm working on currently, but so far I was looking what are the circuit radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now, but the prices are rather high.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_03
 So I know that the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can make the TV do what you want, even if you are in the bathroom or so on.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_03
 But when you're not close to the TV you probably want to need to change the program and so on.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_03
 We will discuss it later maybe.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_00
 Are we planning to take off the shelf and OEM component for the radio wave circuit or are we planning to construct their own circuit board?

0:18:12	SPEAKER_03
 So we just buy a circuit board.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_03
 So I agree on using any kind of LCD, less buttons good for me as a designer of the circuit.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_03
 But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and what does it offer.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I'm surprised it would be out of French or it would be maybe visible.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_03
 I was not thinking too much about the price, but if we use the LCD, even the radio frequency communication with the TV set and the backlight and related things like the photodiodes and stuff, it should be okay.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_03
 If we decide to use the speech recognition then we probably could struggle, but we'll see afterwards.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_03
 It depends on if the M.E. or U.I.D. wants to have it like in metal or in plastics these things.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_03
 It depends on you not because the electric devices, prices not so big in comparison to the overall shape and stuff like that.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_03
 We will discuss it afterwards.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_03
 This is nothing, this is just my note on what to use.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_03
 My personal preference is yes, I would like also preferably to use R.W. circuit, but from the point of view of the design and price, I would stick to the IRs, that's my opinion.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_03
 I mean if infrared circuit not the radio frequency.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_02
 Why? Because it's simpler.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_03
 Because the range where you can use it is fair, it's okay I think and the price is fairly cheap.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_03
 It's a price matter.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_03
 Just a price, otherwise I don't care what I put there because it's the chip which I buy or which we buy.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_00
 How much more expensive are we talking three times more expensive?

0:20:51	SPEAKER_00
 Three times more expensive?

0:20:52	SPEAKER_03
 Three to five.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_03
 Not ten times, but it depends.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_00
 That's a lot.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's probably not worth spending the extra money because all the other remote controls on the market have infrared.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_00
 So people don't expect anything other than infrared.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_03
 So it's not worth spending the extra money.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_03
 They can't see the TV.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_02
 On the other side we want to have something new.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_02
 We want to have something new.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should still think about it.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_00
 Based on my usability studies I feel that users prioritize the look and the feel and the trendiness above the difference between infrared or radio waves.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_00
 So I think we're better off spending money.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_03
 In the usability.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_02
 I have to inform you I receive an email from the management board today and they have new requirements for the remote control.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_02
 First, they said that something about teletext.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_02
 Apparently it becomes, according to them it becomes out of date, outdated.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_02
 Because of the internet popularity and everybody else internet at home and actually it's not useful to have teletext.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_02
 So I think we can avoid teletext.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_02
 The second thing is they suggest that we should use the remote control only for TV, not for DVD and other devices.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_02
 Because it makes it too complex and because we have no much time for this project we should stay on the specific TV remote control.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_02
 The third one is about the image of the company.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_02
 So we should keep the product should be recognized ever.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 That means we should use the color of our company and maybe put somewhere the slogan of the company which is we put fashion in electronics.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_02
 So when people see the remote control they should say oh it's from a reaction and they should recognize the company.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_02
 So now we should take the decision what function we will have on this remote control.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_02
 So are we going to use LCD speech recognition?

0:24:24	SPEAKER_00
 Should we start with just the core, the basic functions that we need and then we can move on to the more advanced features?

0:24:32	SPEAKER_03
 The available things are LCD buttons and everything radio frequency depends and the recognition depends on you guys.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_02
 But first maybe what are the usual functions of standard control?

0:24:56	SPEAKER_00
 The obvious one is changing channels.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should stick on very useful functions because we want less buttons.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_02
 So changing channel of course, volume, setting.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_03
 Just one note to the channel changing will we use only two buttons or numbered buttons?

0:25:38	SPEAKER_03
 I think it would be a button.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_02
 Another side we have more and more channels and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_03
 Like 10 plus, 5 plus, 1 plus, 1 plus, or using the names and the keyboard.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe you could have K buttons like documentary channel and movies.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_02
 If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_03
 It requires the use of LCD to tell you all the same feedback.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_00
 We could maybe incorporate the idea of the slider for the volume with the channel.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_00
 We have channel and volume.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_03
 So we are still speaking about common devices or we are inviting.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_00
 Basically cool functions we want and then more advanced ones.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_02
 What about the settings of the TV? Because we don't choose very often but we need it anyway.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_01
 We don't have any, we don't have visual design, remote control and we don't have any access to the TV design or we can change some design.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_01
 One solution for this changing channels is to see a summary of all channels, some preview of all channels.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_01
 On the screen.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_01
 Not on the screen.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_01
 On the screen.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_03
 On the TV screen.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think we are the ones.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_00
 This remote control we are developing is a generic control for all TVs.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_03
 I think it would be better to stick to the remote control and not bother to TV to print these things.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_03
 It will be still more expensive but for the LCD and this stuff is no problem in the Pride.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_02
 So what are we doing with the settings? Because if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe with the LCD we can do something with less buttons.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_00
 But then you don't want to make the LCD display too complicated.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_00
 At the same time.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_00
 I mean we can always have these less often used functions hidden somewhere under a cover or a back of under a slide.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_03
 We could have for example two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_03
 Or like children and grandfathers modes and the TV manager mode.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_00
 We have five minutes left.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_00
 So I think the settings we agreed that they are required.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_02
 We should hide them somewhere in the menus of the LCD or in the back of the remote control.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_00
 What else?

0:30:06	SPEAKER_00
 I mean a power button obviously.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yes. If I was thinking do we need a power button at all?

0:30:13	SPEAKER_03
 Should we do it like sleep mode after five minutes or not using it?

0:30:17	SPEAKER_02
 Because generally it's a kind of setting I think.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_02
 It should fit into settings.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_02
 Because it's not a very current useful function.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_00
 Well I think when I say power button they mean to turn the TV on and off.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_02
 No I think it's after five minutes or a timer.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_00
 But if you're watching TV for two hours you don't want your TV to turn off.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_03
 You don't want your TV to turn off.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_03
 You don't want your TV to turn off.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_00
 So you should kill this button.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_00
 I mean based on our usability studies again people said that the power button was a very relevant button.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_00
 It was nine out of ten.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_03
 What we could probably do is to keep the LCD and all the buttons and stuff.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_03
 We could make it like an opening stuff that if you open it you just turn on the TV and if you close it it will.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_03
 Turn off the TV if you like.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_00
 I think we need to concentrate on the major usage of the control which is you sit down, you turn on your TV, you change channels, you change the volume, you turn the TV off.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_00
 And all the other functionality is not used very often.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_01
 They can be hired somewhere by a cover or something like this.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_01
 Like covering.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, like mobile phones.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_03
 Since we have the LCD we don't need too much buttons.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, just the decision on the power button should we make it a button or something which would be for what?

0:32:12	SPEAKER_03
 I think a button.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_00
 I think it should be a button.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_03
 It's a button.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, one nice big button.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_03
 Old-fashioned button to satisfy the grandmothers.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_02
 So any other suggestions or functions?

0:32:41	SPEAKER_00
 What about things like the clock and timers?

0:32:53	SPEAKER_03
 Do we still have the time?

0:32:55	SPEAKER_03
 I just wonder.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we have still one or two minutes.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_03
 What is the question?

0:33:03	SPEAKER_00
 You know, some features on their control to display a time or to display.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_03
 You know, TV or something like that.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_03
 But since we want to control all the televisions, it would probably be worse to set the timing on the remote.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_03
 Because if the TV turns on itself, if we add the time, we should be there.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe a bigger display or something like that.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, our users want to have the time on the remote.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_00
 It's a question.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's a trade-off.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_02
 In my opinion, we should have only useful things.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_02
 Because apparently the simplest is better.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_03
 Did you ever use the timing of turning on the TV?

0:34:02	SPEAKER_03
 And based on the...

0:34:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay, very occasionally.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_00
 But I do use the display of the time quite often.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but it can be on the display in the corner all the time on the remote.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's okay.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so no time.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_01
 Do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and speech commands?

0:34:24	SPEAKER_01
 I think it will not take lots of place.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_01
 We just need a microphone and a software.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_01
 And it will be a little bit new and interesting.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_01
 So people may be attracted to buy this stuff.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_01
 And it's not very difficult to put a software inside the electronic device and put a microphone.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't take that much place and also that much.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't cost that much.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_03
 We should be careful about the battery life then.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe we can think more about that and discuss that maybe last time.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_02
 Next time.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_02
 And now the meeting room is busy.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_02
 Somebody booked a meeting room just at 1pm.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_02
 So we should live.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_02
 So no, we are going for a small lunch.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_02
 It's founded by the company.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_02
 And after we have 13 minutes to do individual works.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_02
 And I will do the minutes.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_02
 And you are going to work on your individual works.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_02
 And you will receive as usual specific instructions and so on.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, thank you.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_00
 Cool.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:36:19	None
 Thank you.
