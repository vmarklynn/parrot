0:00:00	SPEAKER_00
 Is this a virtual meeting?

0:00:10	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, there.

0:00:11	SPEAKER_02
 Or is it?

0:00:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:00:13	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:00:14	None
 Thanks.

0:00:15	None
 Okay.

0:00:16	None
 Because that's it.

0:00:18	None
 Okay.

0:00:19	None
 That's it.

0:00:20	None
 That's it.

0:00:21	None
 Okay.

0:00:22	None
 That's it.

0:00:23	None
 Okay.

0:00:24	None
 Okay.

0:00:25	None
 That's it.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_04
 That's it.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:00:29	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_04
 Welcome to our next meeting.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_04
 I have a couple of points we should discuss.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_04
 The proposal.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_04
 I'll go through the proposal.

0:00:40	None
 I'll go through the proposal.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yep.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_04
 And furthermore, as most of you know, I believe in 10th of December.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_04
 I think we should discuss how we proceed in the meantime.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_04
 Because I'd like to say different signals, on statements, I believe as I keep having the higher probabilities that will return a case for the procedure, together, Jacob Anvis, and IEP66, it will be.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_04
 I would like to say, our year stage will be end of January.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_04
 So that means you have to get over six weeks and then furthermore, I would like to know the status of everybody.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_04
 No, for sure.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_04
 Um, guys, you will have your plans and then we'll have your plans, what is ongoing process concerning your work, okay from you is definitely clear, what are your current plans and need my maybe use and also what we have discussed before and so I think the ongoing process is you use AIA and also this new current work.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_04
 And for my point it seems to be clear that I will go back definitely a tenth of December and I mentioned before probably will be more than 50% of what I would like to say that I will be come back to get the freedom to relance here the project in the sense or ever kind of form and get the principle paid by another project within Zeeman's.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_04
 So the point is how long I will stay, I will be a couple of months definitely and based on the success I think that's always an ongoing process to go back to Germany for a couple of weeks and then come here and go on with this work.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_04
 So that is my current opinion concerning how you was dealing with this work ongoing effort.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_04
 And first of all I would like to first of all thanks to Gidman because he started to use the test pad.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_04
 He was with his dad. Yeah. So the first box is warning.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_04
 I will set up definitely my spare time and leave it in the weekends, the second box.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_04
 And I'm looking for two other volunteers who are setting the set in the first box.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_06
 But what are the boxes?

0:03:01	SPEAKER_06
 Boxes, PCs.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_04
 But what?

0:03:05	SPEAKER_04
 Equipers, we should equip it with linux or maybe three feet.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_01
 First stop the first thing the most complicated is to fit them with the removal, removal hard disk.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_01
 But it's yeah.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_01
 So the first computer had to, what's the right word, I had to put everything out to put the removal hard disk in the box.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's ID, but it's not very difficult or something like that.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_01
 So you just have to...

0:03:45	SPEAKER_04
 Why were laughing?

0:03:47	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know. I didn't see him.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know what he did.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_04
 I was running it. I was definitely...

0:03:55	SPEAKER_01
 So will that set up the second computer?

0:03:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, maybe.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know about your time cost.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_06
 I can build any computer installing whatever it needed.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, I really enjoy doing it.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_06
 That's okay for me.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe also to support your own...

0:04:15	SPEAKER_04
 No promises.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_04
 And even maybe to support your IGMP stuff on it.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_02
 No promises.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_04
 No promises.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_01
 So it's about one hour to put this hard disk in and a further hour to...

0:04:35	SPEAKER_01
 Well, two hours, three hours to install your operating system.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_04
 We've been waiting until the network is one and because it's not the most...

0:04:43	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, the most...

0:04:45	SPEAKER_04
 Based on certain firewall constraints, I believe David is currently working on that to set up the firewall and he's not an expert for that.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_04
 And when I get the signal, I would ask one more time.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_04
 But that's thanks to...

0:04:59	SPEAKER_04
 Do you network such internet connectivity?

0:05:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, we have for secure socket and for web access, the firewall is over there.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_04
 But Kali is not working, right?

0:05:11	SPEAKER_01
 Right. On Friday when I installed Linux the first time, I got access to the local network here.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_01
 But not to any machines outside of ICSI.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_01
 And till Monday there's no access at all to any machines, also not to insulate machines.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_01
 So I think it's related to the work they've done on Sunday here and I...

0:05:37	SPEAKER_02
 Is it only you should have access to all the instruments?

0:05:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, it's time.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_04
 It's not the Internet, outside access, but not the Internet and not the Air again or whatever time.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_02
 No, no.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_02
 No, no USB.

0:05:53	None
 The FDP is...

0:05:55	None
 Or not, I don't know.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_04
 Because the point is that we will use it as it describes several times, that we will use it as a local network.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_04
 But it doesn't make sense to use certain kinds of media, transportation, to put some stuff you need from your PC or your... to this...

0:06:13	SPEAKER_04
 To this testpad, you know.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_04
 So you download it, it must be possible from the network normative.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_04
 It should be used as...

0:06:22	SPEAKER_04
 For demonstration, or to figure out if you have a scenario where you have to use more than one box, which you have on your desktop.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_04
 So that is the primary reason for this testpad.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_04
 So there, they will have to have WebExcess, which will download the necessary files.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_04
 So on the third or more, one more thanks to Claudia.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_04
 She did a lot of work and I could only...

0:06:52	SPEAKER_00
 Other testpad.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_04
...and some devices and some discusses with her concerning the web pages.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_04
 And now, yeah, I'm in the position of the state we have to do with the project.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_04
 There are also some contributions from yoga I requested.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_04
 And a lonely page in front of where we have to...

0:07:10	SPEAKER_04
 It's primarily my job, I just set up.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_04
 It's adjusted to the people who are worse to be...

0:07:17	SPEAKER_04
...alone's...

0:07:19	SPEAKER_04
...alone's...

0:07:20	SPEAKER_04
...alone's.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_04
...alone's.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not sure how to do it.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_05
 No, it is good to get in that.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_04
 This good getting in that.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_04
 But I think everybody should take a look to the web pages.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_04
 And in front of Claudia, if something has to be approved or there are some comments...

0:07:44	SPEAKER_04
 He's lucky, I was a type one.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_04
 And because it's very important, maybe not for us, maybe for our successors and maybe somebody will come back once a day or send some comments.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_04
 Or some colleagues or whatever.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_04
 So my point of view, I will document an average thing when I believe here in the sense that potential successors and group leaders can group in with these things.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_04
 And that these web pages will be updated every time when it is necessary.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_04
 We try to do it, that it must be at least updated only when really major changes happen.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_04
 That means somebody is leaving the group, somebody is joining the group, the new project is started.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_04
 But the effort should be minimized as possible.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_04
 And so please take a look to the web pages.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_04
 And I have announced in the project area the major headlines.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_04
 And especially a little bit maybe you can write something about yours. I call it multi-carcens and develop my deployment for a specific multi-carc.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe a few lines, maybe a picture.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_04
 And something like that should be added with the AIA or case that's my stuff.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_04
 And then the next point is that this active routing stuff.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_04
 I would like to discuss it before, but you were busy.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_04
 And so I believe it must be adjusted to the current activities a little bit more.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_04
 And I think it is not worth to discuss it now because nobody has it.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_04
 And so let us have a bilateral discussion afterwards.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_04
 Your contribution is related to certain kind of things that haven't here.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_04
 That means with the project proposal itself.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_04
 And also maybe to the USIA AIA architecture.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_04
 That sends certain stages because it's a general architecture.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_04
 And so that certain stages maybe to future mobile core networks that it is related to these kind of things.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_04
 And what I have in mind is that things should not be started from the end system.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_04
 Just my principle of concern because set will now be happy for my point of view.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_04
 It should be started as the actual device.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_04
 So that the certain kind of mechanism of whatever is enabled between the increased edge device and the output edge device.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_04
 Because it will be at a certain stage IP based as a future generation to the communication networks.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_04
 Before it's going through the overall internet.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_04
 Between these both boxes, I can assume because the mobility happens there as a normal network sink.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_04
 And so forwardly processing or outing process should be no more separated from my point of view.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_04
 And to have their certain kind of intelligent mechanism that packets can be used to set up so house because they have also information.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_04
 They know where they have to go because I feel as if they're there within the packet.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_04
 And how can these use within these areas?

0:11:08	SPEAKER_04
 And how is this area is an aligned to the more traditional routing within the internet backbone itself?

0:11:15	SPEAKER_04
 That's my question.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_04
 I think that's a good research area.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_04
 And I think there's a lot of expert.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, for this.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_04
 I believe there's a lot of potential.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_04
 And we should discuss it maybe in that other afterwards.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_04
 So one more time, everybody should take a look through the web pages.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_04
 And from Claudia is there a general in Marx.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_04
 And should write based on the headlight of the project proposal.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_04
 So things what still happened, the things what they have still in mind.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_04
 So that we can update these last, you know, the last major part of the web pages.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_01
 The pages are already on the web.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, it is.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_04
 The panel excesses normally was maybe.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_04
 So there are some gaps.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_00
 So there are some gaps.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_04
 So I've got the E1.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_04
 And so.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_07
 So there are some gaps left.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_07
 Maybe you can also read through the other text which is on the web pages.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_07
 Because I like to change the text a bit.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_07
 Because sometimes it's too long, sometimes it's too short.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_07
 Maybe the English is not that good.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_07
 But anyways, so I tried to do this today.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_07
 And if you could do it afterwards, it would be really nice.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_07
 Because I'm quite sure that I can find every like graphic.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_06
 There are a couple of comments I have about the web pages.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_06
 I think it's Joe's graphic.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_06
 I think it should be.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, the graphics are too bad.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe you are wanting at it.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_04
 It was a good save.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_06
 And then maybe the ICSI logo could be.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_06
 I can't change something with logo.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_06
 No, it is just maybe we can translate the white color into transparent color.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_06
 So it will get more natural.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_06
 Good.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_07
 Another thing is I want to get a link on the logo so that you can come from the logo to the ICSI web page.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_07
 That's some things I have to do.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_07
 If you have something which I should put on the web page for you.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_07
 So some pages will be nice if you sent it.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_07
 It will be nice.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_07
 And the page will be nice if you send it.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_07
 And then the page will be about some information for people who are newcomers.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_07
 Or I don't know, good word for it.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_07
 Should we use new cameras or somebody with new arriving here or wants to send an application?

0:13:45	SPEAKER_07
 Newbies.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_02
 Huh?

0:13:47	SPEAKER_07
 Newbies.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_07
 Newbies?

0:13:49	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_07
 So they have to add some information.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_07
 I don't know.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_07
 I tried to set up everything by today for this page because I have started with this.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_07
 I have any kind of ideas what was important for you.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_07
 Because I have some points like Pacific Bell, long distance carriers, cars and car insurances, health insurances.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_07
 So health insurances is something I can only say for German people.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_07
 So maybe I don't know if this is different in Spain that will be fine to have some information or in Holland.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_06
 So maybe you will take a look and I will tell you some of the things.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_07
 So maybe how you did it or whatsoever.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_07
 So maybe I will tell you some of the things because I have something.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_07
 Then what else did I have?

0:14:39	SPEAKER_07
 And other points like what about bank?

0:14:42	SPEAKER_07
 So transferring your money from Europe over here, what is the cheapest way or what could you recommend or something?

0:14:50	SPEAKER_07
 Another point.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_07
 There is another point like going out in Berkeley or what to do in Berkeley and the neighbourhood.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_02
 So this stuff is not that's written in the group energy.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_07
 No, I know.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah but no matter who is that.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_07
 But there is nothing like this on the XC page as far as I know.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_04
 So, and the point we discussed it still a couple of months ago.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_04
 The point is normally it is, I see it's item anyway.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, it's at least it should be what I think are the issues.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_06
 Well, they have a white booklet probably.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but it's not on the web.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, no.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_04
 Normally that was my...

0:15:37	SPEAKER_06
 In fact, the Pacific Alphon was not working for example.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_06
 When I tried the phone on this booklet, it was not working.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_06
 But the thing is that maybe this could be an starting point or...

0:15:50	SPEAKER_07
 I don't know, maybe I talked with Jane about this.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_07
 If we can use this information, I don't know, somewhere on the XC home page.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe every group has somewhere hidden...

0:16:05	SPEAKER_02
 The point is that nobody feels responsible for that.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_02
 But my point is that it should not be under the internet group.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_04
 It's a common.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, but it sees at your point.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_04
 But if it is under the nightclub, the group leaders responsible to get up to date information.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_04
 I believe there's a group where the people are changing much more fast that we join the group and to use the group as other groups.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_04
 So, the most problem, is that there's a people here in this group with this information, much more often as other groups.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_02
 That could still be applicable if you put it under the XC side if you take responsibility for it.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_02
 I talked to Jane about this.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_02
 I think both arguments are not...

0:16:56	SPEAKER_02
 arguments against having this under the normal IC side page or under the network page.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_05
 But your problem is, are you allowed to change anything on the general XC server?

0:17:09	SPEAKER_07
 No, this is why I have to talk to Jane.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_05
 So, maybe in just a link from the main image to the web of this structure.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_04
 So, real unique street in compliance and in accordance with what you...

0:17:21	SPEAKER_04
 this structure of web pages.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_04
 And that means the group leader normally do not have access to the general web pages.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_04
 It has access to the end of the page.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_04
 But I think there's an administration problem in the library.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_04
 There are the agrees as the information page must be on the general, on the highest level.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, there's no problem with that.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_01
 I think you're argument is...

0:17:51	SPEAKER_01
 I think we have to have to write to change it.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_01
 So, if there's anything changing in insurances or something like that, that we have access to this page further on to make any changes.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, this is not a problem at all.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, if you are coming from Germany and you know that they have something changed with the health insurance, then you send Jane an email like, could you please change this?

0:18:14	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but that's more complicated.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_05
 That's the whole problem that nobody wants to do it.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, okay.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_04
 You know how close as you was at the end of the page.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_04
 And that was a reason.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_04
 We finally decided that we put it to the information on the end of the page.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_04
 We have to start with this.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_01
 I think the best solution is really to put a link on the ICSI page to this stuff.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_01
 And the stuff itself is located at our server.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_04
 In our directory.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, in our directory.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, so it's a link.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_07
 And then we have to ask this.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_07
 Another point is I would like to add another button, something which is called like events or, I don't know, yeah, I guess like all the events where we could announce talks which are, you know, future talks for the future.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_07
 And we could also have a link on, for instance, the two workshops which are going on last summer.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_07
 So, Hanna's workshop and then the workshop from Oliver.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_07
 That there might be a link behind this workshops and or format talks we have.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_07
 So, like, from people who have been here before.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_07
 And you went to publish their slides or an article or whatsoever behind there.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_07
 So that we have like a button for events which are where workshops can be announced or old workshops could be shown or whatever.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_04
 Because that is a living thing.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's a good idea.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_04
 Not only that the workshop was a talk and on because they are still announced that it was a broader sense.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_04
 But I think that the different cloud is very good that the slides on the talks here.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_04
 If it's worse to have it on the web anyway.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_04
 It should be published in that way that the people can access it.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_04
 I have my website, I have a slides maybe.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, with some things.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_04
 And it's going on maybe you have some multi-card slides concerning your own about your NPN.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_04
 And if you have some talks from X term and we have some in the past, you can also put the slides on.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_04
 Because there's still a growing context of opportunity for the people you know.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, is this guided?

0:20:32	SPEAKER_04
 Something that maybe I can contact him and ask him what he likes to do with something, contribute, whatever.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_04
 So that's interesting.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_04
 It's a great idea from Canada to perhaps this event page because it's not a big deal.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_07
 No, it's easy to edit.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, then it's not okay.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_04
 There are no events and there are no events.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_04
 But we still have a few which happened in the last year.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_04
 And it's okay, then it is a going thing.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_04
 It's done automatically.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_04
 That's a goal.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_04
 Or the goal put some things on the web.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_04
 Something into the center page.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_04
 Everybody agree?

0:21:11	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it could be a good thing if we have such an event button that somewhere beneath this button or wherever.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_01
 That there's a date when the last update was.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_01
 So that you know it's worse to click this button to see there's a new announcement or not.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_01
 Otherwise you are often clicking this button and you get your old information or even an empty page.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, but this will be done down on the button on the page anyways.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we can have updated or you know the button.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, something like that.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_04
 Then update it.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_04
 Last update.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe something happened.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know how we do with that.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_04
 So it's just a suggestion.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know how easy this to implement something like that.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, okay.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_04
 Let's consider.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:22:13	None
 Okay.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_04
 So that's the next point.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_04
 And I believe.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_04
 That's the last one.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_04
 This one that I would like to know the status as far as possible from everybody concerning his future intention here.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_04
 And I see that I know that even the country where he considered currency, the country viewed here to as a proposal.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_04
 Because you know I'm facing the problem if I go back to Siemens and say okay, there's a potential.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_04
 There's a potential context.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_04
 Probably maybe no money.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_04
 If you go in one direction, it is worse to know that people can still go on in that area of some kind of work and they are back in the university of that company.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_04
 And even there's another one should have part time jobs and if it's come to a real proposal that maybe the people can move in one more time because that needs this information definitely to inform.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_04
 So Siemens management that is worse to simply back here.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe it would work you can start to believe and of generally definitely.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_04
 And currently you see no chance as far as I know to stay longer here.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_04
 And either you will go back to KPN or you will stay here and find a job opportunity in another company.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_04
 Is that why can you give us more detailed concern as status?

0:23:54	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_07
 I think it's happening.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_07
 For me everything has completely changed.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_07
 So now I go back and I don't know anything what to do.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_07
 So I have to sort everything out when I'm back in Germany.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_07
 But I won't go back to the university.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_04
 So you are looking for a job.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_04
 Probably then okay.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_04
 Because we are not going to say you were lost for that.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_02
 I think so.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_02
 Lost this maybe did.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_02
 I can't say you were missing that.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_02
 But I think you were also a KPN.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_02
 It's lost for the ICO.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_02
 So we are not going to have a budget cut.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_02
 Nothing is possible in the motion.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_04
 So from your side, the statement is that independent of your person, KPN is not willing to send us another cut.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_04
 Any way.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_04
 And if they are interested in a certain kind of project, then it must be related to the certain kind of service or certain kind of end-sister or your product or whatever kind of thing.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_02
 It's going to be different.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_02
 It will be a start-up.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_02
 And then they are working on a few of them in this area.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_02
 But it's outside of ICO.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_04
 So KPN and I say, I believe.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_04
 And I'm totally intent to do it the last two months.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_02
 Holiday.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_02
 I am working on something an open source.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_02
 Because I can't come back.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it's a little bit out of Mark.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_02
 Right now I'm interested and I'm looking into it and working.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_02
 I started yesterday actually working on it to do an implementation of the protocol that was designed by Mark on an open source as it's different from the one that's of Mark's project.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_04
 Do you finish that?

0:26:17	SPEAKER_04
 I do.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_04
 I finish that until the end of the challenge.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_02
 I wanted to be a little bit hard-talked.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_02
 I was like, it's right.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_04
 I'm working with it.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, I'll be here until the end of your life.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_06
 And well, even later, if there is some interesting work going on, well, I will be able to do some work from Spain to...

0:26:51	SPEAKER_06
 So that's my future forecast.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_04
 Do we have some students who could be joined...

0:27:03	SPEAKER_04
 I assume there isn't some activity made.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_06
 Well, you know, the problem...

0:27:08	SPEAKER_06
 I think that we have a problem or a difference in Spain at least compared with the Americans.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_06
 And is that our students are not getting involved in research until they have finished their studies?

0:27:24	SPEAKER_06
 So it's something a little bit strange, but this is the...

0:27:28	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not sorry.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_05
 They are not in work and they're in service.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_05
 You know...

0:27:34	SPEAKER_02
 Lectures.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_06
 You know, they...

0:27:37	SPEAKER_06
 No, no, no.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_06
 You have to pass the different tests and you have to study the different subjects until you have finished with this.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_06
 Well, okay, you can do it by your own, but the thing is that you're not supposed to do it.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_06
 And usually students are pretty busy for not doing other things.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_01
 And there's no final master thesis or something like that for the whole platform.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_06
 Not really.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_06
 You know, there is, there is, but it is not a research work.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_06
 Usually it's an application work.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_06
 So you build a website, you own a commerce site, whatever, or a program, or...

0:28:15	SPEAKER_04
 I didn't study anything.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_06
 But it is not something your teacher provides you some research papers in your...

0:28:24	SPEAKER_06
 Let's say, build a simulator, try to...

0:28:27	SPEAKER_06
 No, that's a good question.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_06
 So we have other students, which are people that has a grant, and they are starting as researchers.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_06
 But this is only connected to your own funding.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_06
 So if you have projects, you can have people working with you if you don't have a research project.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_06
 Well, you cannot pay them, so you usually you don't have anybody.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_06
 So it's kind of dependent on the funding we have in some projects.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_06
 So it's not sure.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_06
 Not really sure.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_04
 Talking about Census students here at the time, I'm talking about...

0:29:10	SPEAKER_04
 There is an activity at least with an A group that certain kind of activities, or the universities could apply for semester works.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_04
 We have a kind of thing.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_06
 I think we could find some workforce.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_06
 Because you can redirect the work as a subject, the work, or something that you can try to...

0:29:39	SPEAKER_06
 In some subjects, in fact, the topics are more open, so you can introduce some research topics too.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_06
 But the main thing is that there is a big difference, because students are not supposed to do research work until they have finished.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_06
 They're great.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_06
 You can change that.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, sure.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it's pretty healthy for a student to have a project where you have to write some research.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I think so too.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_06
 But it also depends on the subjects, because sometimes subjects are fixed, so you cannot give any stuff you want.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_06
 You have to provide a certain problem for the subject too.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_06
 But sometimes, especially in the latest courses, things are probably more open, and there's something that can be changed.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_04
 I'll just mention that you also think.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_04
 For me, and I said before, I will be funded by the Ministry of German Government, and probably search for projects, or what the idea is. That seems to be sure.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_04
 And they got absolutely free then to do what I would like to do.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_04
 I would like to go on as a coup as an Islamic investment, and in the late 19th century, I also have activities as a Georgia Tech.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_04
 They have now, or PhDs, as a settled, and my next generation of contract, are also going in that sense. So the topic is going on going on.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_04
 And then I will come back here, and I would like to use these things to maybe come to a closer, bigger project, outside of this goal, with contributions here, further forward from the NSA group, and then from other partners.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_04
 But this I have definitely discussed with my management, and this will happen in December, in the beginning of January.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_04
 And I will keep informed to the management, by the way.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_04
 But also, I assume that my suggestions, if you have a BDFORM conference, email exchange, you wait that time, so that we can inform each other, concerning what I was explaining, what I was talking about, what I was saying.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_04
 I think we have details, these things, that are one of the other things.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, how was your idea and your plans?

0:32:24	SPEAKER_04
 Well, you're a giant.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_04
 I will...

0:32:27	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's a test, but you won't be allowed to do it.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, no, no.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_01
 So I will stay here, did the end of February.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_01
 And afterwards, at Berlin, I'm... yeah, founded by an institution of the German government, so they are paying me, and I have to do research for them, of course.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_01
 I have to reach some goals and so on.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_01
 But on the other hand, there will be some time left, I think, to do some work on this area I started here.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_01
 And for me, myself, I'm also very interested in, in continuities work.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_01
 And so that will be manageable.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_01
 And on the other hand, there are also some students, or...

0:33:20	SPEAKER_01
 Well, at the moment, it's quite difficult to find students who are doing their master's thesis and so on, because there are not a lot of students, which are in this state and Germany now.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_01
 But about two years ago, the numbers of students were studying computer science, started to increase again.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_01
 And so in one or two years, we will have many students, which are performing their master's thesis.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_01
 And so I think there will also be many students, which are joining in this work.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_01
 So hopefully, I will find some students, which are joining in.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_01
 So hopefully, this work will be going on.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, it's a little bit for me, and my...

0:34:13	SPEAKER_05
 So I won't change the topics, I'm here until end of May.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_05
 And after that, I personally go into a Siemens project with some department of treatment, but related to that topic, but I've done here, so, with some of pre-stage, so that might be more related or loosely related, so at least it's in the same topic.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_05
 And progress is going on, but it's not that fast going on as I would have liked it.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_05
 I would like to have it, sorry.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_04
 So, what is the current status anyway?

0:34:56	SPEAKER_05
 Currently, I'm looking into quality of self-shooting, and I had discussions with the post-op from the UCB, where we started to collect information to write a paper about quality of serving, rooting for MPLS and an MPLS domain.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_05
 So you have distributed rooting at the edges.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_05
 And one aspect is that the information is outdated, but you're not always at the exact information of your link status and so on.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_05
 So what we have plans of that, and trying to look at some rooting policies or rooting items.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_03
 Now, as I see in principle, the early RPU MPLS of a certain kind of successor of active rology, because principle of the forwarding part is a little bit de-couple of the logic parts,

0:35:56	SPEAKER_04
 and this was in principle. Okay, it's much really the subject, but in the broader sense, in that sense, I think there are a certain degree of alignment for the enterprise.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_05
 So at least from the definition of Christian truly MPLS is a subset of active rooting.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_05
 So it's very aesthetic, it's no active, but it's sort of active because they have these program statements.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_04
 There is a separation of ones that I do not use in normal tradition, and data forwarding parts and updated points with only the vialing information.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_06
 But they are using the same idea of leveling packets with a content descriptor or something.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_04
 So what I mean is at a certain degree, we have a second point.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_04
 So my last point, I'm responsible for the proposal itself.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_04
 I know it's a possibility of us, if I'm not writing something, nothing but heaven.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_04
 So I believe what you are going out of these activity, you have to use your time to finish your work as your head and mind until the end of February or that life.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_04
 And of general, sorry, so you will not find any time to contribute any watches as an activity.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_04
 Then from me, as science, I expect more detailed vision.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_04
 We can do it as I mentioned before.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_04
 A little bit afterwards, concerning your work and how you think it could be a significant contribution to the activity, maybe based on the generic USID architecture.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_04
 I will write as long as I have time here on the proposal itself.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_04
 And in the Vietrung future, I've a distributed list of small cluster of people.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_04
 I tried to access one pair several times. He didn't answer because he still had mentions that there's minor funding.

0:38:25	SPEAKER_04
 I think would help, for instance, to have an English meeting, either here or here or wherever.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_04
 I have a contact one more time, Professor. What is the name? Well, I'm not even mentioned.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_04
 Because you are a professor in a responsible for the infrastructure and the USID and the USID as a project, which are related to these activities and the name of intelligent class.

0:38:59	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know whether I can succeed to get an appointment.

0:39:03	SPEAKER_04
 But I would distribute a list, contact list, and the interest of each partner, so that everybody can see.

0:39:11	SPEAKER_04
 Everybody knows that I have a mind. Maybe it's a small NSA-COO activity.

0:39:15	SPEAKER_04
 Let's have this knowledge linkage to the outer world.

0:39:19	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe it's an NSA-COO activity with a linkage to the outer world based on the universities at home, there's some linkage. The sub stages, there's an annual activity in this area with supportive home entities and with certain kind of linkage here for the companies that are in the university.

0:39:43	SPEAKER_04
 The last one, I think is the best one.

0:39:47	SPEAKER_04
 You see the question, as always, where's the money?

0:39:51	None
 I said, oh, poor. I don't know. The second person is how long I stay here.

0:39:56	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know. So everybody's waiting.

0:39:59	SPEAKER_04
 And the only activity could come from the NSA-COO.

0:40:04	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's a evolving process and it takes some time and everything must be a little bit more.

0:40:11	SPEAKER_04
 But anyway, I would like to get contributions from the people here of the NSA-COO.

0:40:17	SPEAKER_04
 So the little living thing and the pity that multi-card is a principle removed and we do not have any experts for multi-card anymore.

0:40:28	SPEAKER_04
 And that makes very hard, I believe, because that is a major.

0:40:33	SPEAKER_04
 On the least 25% of the world never start.

0:40:41	SPEAKER_04
 But nevertheless, we have to live as a situation.

0:40:46	SPEAKER_04
 Right? Right. Again.

0:40:49	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe we have to rewrite something.

0:40:52	SPEAKER_04
 Have new ideas going focus more in certain kind of really telecommunication, effort, and the hard thing and cool stuff.

0:41:00	SPEAKER_04
 And to move upon the version magic hard stuff, it's not a better pity because that's interesting.

0:41:05	SPEAKER_04
 It's a really, really good source of research work for the future telecommunication core networks because they are still not able to do with multi-card.

0:41:16	SPEAKER_04
 They still have the talent generation and all these kind of things.

0:41:21	SPEAKER_04
 And I believe that would be very beneficial if we use it for the mobile scenarios in their network.

0:41:28	SPEAKER_04
 So by NLA, we have to live as a real situation and then we have to drop multi-card from the proposal.

0:41:38	SPEAKER_06
 Any comments? All not really.

0:41:43	SPEAKER_06
 I think that all in the future somebody will come to the NSA group.

0:41:50	SPEAKER_04
 And we can't extend it all the more time.

0:41:53	SPEAKER_06
 So no, I mean, that's okay.

0:41:56	SPEAKER_06
 I think that it cannot be considered the first time tasked to do because nobody is knowledgeable about multi-card thing.

0:42:04	SPEAKER_06
 But I think that any of us could address this in the future or maybe a new person could address this in the future.

0:42:13	SPEAKER_06
 So I mean, what I think is that it makes no sense to me to reduce something which is more or less complete because we don't have the person.

0:42:27	SPEAKER_06
 I think that the way to go is probably the opposite to try to find something which has a meaning by itself and then try to get the resources to do this.

0:42:40	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe you understand it in a wrong way.

0:42:43	SPEAKER_04
 I do not mean to drop it to remove the text from the proposal.

0:42:47	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. I mean activities.

0:42:49	SPEAKER_04
 Planning activities.

0:42:50	SPEAKER_04
 That's okay. Sorry, sorry.

0:42:52	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, because that's why I mentioned that it is an important thing.

0:42:57	SPEAKER_04
 Currently there's only one new group member, St. Buholz, who will figure out the thing, how to say.

0:43:10	SPEAKER_04
 Taking into account the end system was a limited end system.

0:43:14	SPEAKER_04
 Capabilities was respect to mobility and the network itself.

0:43:19	SPEAKER_04
 Where it should be adapted. Where it should be the adoption process performed to deal with different devices for your weakest access to the network.

0:43:29	SPEAKER_04
 Should it be in the end system itself, should be in the edge device, should be in the course, should be in the server.

0:43:34	SPEAKER_04
 These are the questions you would like to figure out and to have a principle and cons of all these different approaches.

0:43:44	SPEAKER_04
 So that's the only new member who's spent two hours.

0:43:50	SPEAKER_04
 Because here I invited him and discussed the same.

0:43:53	SPEAKER_04
 There's what tends to work. I was a fan.

0:43:56	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, you just want to take it?

0:43:58	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:43:59	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:44:00	SPEAKER_04
 He's already an ex-exec.

0:44:01	SPEAKER_04
 Only for administration stuff.

0:44:02	SPEAKER_04
 But for the technical discussion he was here one day.

0:44:05	SPEAKER_04
 There must be three weeks ago.

0:44:08	SPEAKER_02
 I just met him when I arrived.

0:44:14	SPEAKER_02
 He was going to...

0:44:20	SPEAKER_04
 He will come mid-or general.

0:44:26	SPEAKER_04
 But there's the only guy.

0:44:28	SPEAKER_04
 He's not reflected in the sense that he removes the text.

0:44:32	SPEAKER_04
 What I mean is that what's kind of activity we are going with detail is quite an effort.

0:44:39	SPEAKER_04
 And detail is what detail is.

0:44:45	SPEAKER_04
 So any other person?

0:44:48	SPEAKER_04
 Any other command?

0:44:56	SPEAKER_04
 That we push it start with reading the numbers.

0:45:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, we have to do it.

0:45:05	SPEAKER_04
 So that means we have to read the transcript number and send the numbers.

0:45:09	SPEAKER_04
 And if there's a new line short break.

0:45:13	SPEAKER_04
 And afterwards we have two devices switched on.

0:45:18	SPEAKER_04
 So please do not switch off the devices.

0:45:21	SPEAKER_04
 I'll recall again in advance.

0:45:25	SPEAKER_04
 So I will start.

0:45:29	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.
