0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 if you please want to sit down and I'm gonna show you

0:00:04	SPEAKER_00
 sure

0:00:06	SPEAKER_02
 it's not safe yet

0:00:08	SPEAKER_00
 okay

0:00:14	SPEAKER_02
 so

0:00:18	None
 okay it's gonna be beautiful drawing

0:00:32	SPEAKER_03
 so just so this is our agenda you're going to show your prototype presentation after me

0:00:48	SPEAKER_01
 oops

0:00:52	SPEAKER_03
 oh yeah so these are the

0:01:00	SPEAKER_01
 oh okay

0:01:04	SPEAKER_03
 so these are the last notes we made if anything doesn't look right just say to me I don't know if people didn't report

0:01:16	SPEAKER_02
 you know we're doing the speech recognition because didn't have enough time to design the inside as well

0:01:26	SPEAKER_03
 okay but still possible financially so if you want to okay then we're gonna put it in

0:01:36	SPEAKER_02
 yeah we have to design the inside then but

0:01:38	SPEAKER_01
 are we making a slide open like underneath or fold open

0:01:44	SPEAKER_03
 slide open is quite usual for remote control

0:01:48	SPEAKER_01
 yeah like underneath you can slide it open and you can and maybe that's stronger as well yeah that's it's okay

0:01:56	SPEAKER_02
 okay I think that's better and you have a lot of room inside so you can make it very easy to use because you can write a lot of comments besides

0:02:06	SPEAKER_03
 okay so this is okay I'll cool to you

0:02:10	SPEAKER_02
 no we're gonna use advanced chips then

0:02:14	SPEAKER_03
 okay so that's just how much that is okay for the speech yeah I think so I don't know no you have a different chip for speech recognition okay so I'll read it calculated that and still in the

0:02:28	SPEAKER_02
 butch it's okay

0:02:30	None
 good so you can show your prototype if you want to

0:02:40	SPEAKER_01
 yeah together yeah let's do it together I'll give comments okay yeah we just made a word file with the basic elements the look and feel model well the form the case as drawn there simply a square with round corners so that's basically it the materials should be hard plastic color changeable and also transparent color and transparent or just transparent I don't know then the elements we have the functions are just basic like I've pointed a mere mute function on off function text functions this is the switch channel okay cool and this is the the numpad and the logo is over here in the mic okay and scroll you'll know you operate that with your pointing finger so you hold it like this in your right hand and

0:04:06	SPEAKER_03
 so how many things do you need for the microphone speech recognition

0:04:12	SPEAKER_02
 only one button to say it's a specification of that but I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something

0:04:22	SPEAKER_01
 yeah maybe you have to configure it

0:04:26	SPEAKER_02
 yes you need options to figure it and after that you don't need them anymore so you can put it on the back as well if you

0:04:32	SPEAKER_01
 yeah you can all have around the slide function I don't know okay well we haven't had time to design that the slides

0:04:40	SPEAKER_02
 we also don't know how many buttons are required or what kind of buttons but you have a lot of room if you can slide it open yeah you can put it on the back I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something so enough room

0:04:56	SPEAKER_01
 the position yeah you're right

0:05:00	SPEAKER_02
 you wrote this so well name the main zap buttons armor center this was the most important thing so best read place best read place buttons text buttons mute buttons archicadder and at the place they usually are easy to find the enough button is bit bigger so it stands out that why you don't have to make it right because it will show up a score we lose on the left side it's basically the standard place for score

0:05:36	SPEAKER_01
 but it's not impossible to use it if you're left handed so because you can use your thumb then

0:05:46	SPEAKER_00
 just one thing now you need to have more one two you've got one two three four five six seven eight nine but you missed the zero and the two

0:05:58	SPEAKER_02
 strides

0:06:00	SPEAKER_04
 I'm just so you get that

0:06:04	SPEAKER_00
 okay but it's rather important

0:06:08	SPEAKER_02
 we just missed that well just okay back to later the foreign well you have taken that from the iPod other popular technical device so it should be popular with the buttons creating if you that are all round shapes not around its corners okay so that now you get a bit of round feeling no use hard plastic since that allows us to use the 2D buttons non-rober buttons color changeable well and the backlight thing the thing that lights up we have decided in the channel buttons there's a little color around it okay and also in the numpad there's also color around the light behind it

0:07:08	SPEAKER_03
 and we still can choose what color you want how do you want to implement that maybe on the second level as well

0:07:18	SPEAKER_01
 yeah these are just basic functions so all the non-basic

0:07:22	SPEAKER_03
 okay just draw the second level which is we need that as well

0:07:26	SPEAKER_00
 okay there's one function I use daily and it's not on the basic functions it's to switch to your score PlayStation or DVD player okay maybe we use this button for that yeah maybe or you can lay it beneath and the other yeah as well

0:07:48	SPEAKER_03
 do you make your device maybe just draw second level one and say all options that are still left or something a second level

0:07:56	SPEAKER_01
 new

0:07:58	SPEAKER_03
 just here

0:08:02	SPEAKER_00
 how does the second level come out it's light so it's light I think yeah you can maybe

0:08:08	SPEAKER_02
 you can do it with the claps open but I think that's not solid no that's not good

0:08:14	SPEAKER_03
 yeah that's right

0:08:16	SPEAKER_02
 it doesn't even have to slide all the way up so what do we need the speech functions buttons

0:08:24	SPEAKER_01
 yeah just

0:08:26	SPEAKER_02
 menu menu button with maybe arrows so you can roll in the navigate the menu oh my god I think we can even put we have one for zero and one for the more digit so this is the video channel PlayStation that's used pretty often yeah but you have PlayStation

0:09:04	SPEAKER_01
 you use it every day basic

0:09:08	None
 external you want to save the files yeah

0:09:20	None
 drawing so here are multiple speech buttons I don't know how many doesn't really

0:09:30	SPEAKER_02
 it doesn't matter that it's stable what else what else menu buttons

0:09:38	SPEAKER_00
 yeah it's with the arrows

0:09:40	SPEAKER_02
 like things best if we do where do we

0:09:48	SPEAKER_01
 like a normal

0:09:50	SPEAKER_02
 like on the normal

0:09:52	SPEAKER_01
 like this

0:09:54	SPEAKER_02
 yeah within the middle a menu button well you don't have any anything on how many buttons speech you cry so it can't really

0:10:06	None
 design it maybe one button to switch the color of your lets and you can hold it

0:10:18	SPEAKER_02
 and hold it and then

0:10:22	SPEAKER_03
 we can use the colors which you can maybe we just make it three buttons

0:10:28	SPEAKER_00
 all the colors on it red yeah if you have enough place and then we can do that we can put those here color buttons

0:10:42	None
 and then we choose green blue and red ok ok that's

0:10:58	SPEAKER_01
 so did we miss anything

0:11:00	SPEAKER_02
 maybe some text that is probably that there's volume

0:11:06	SPEAKER_00
 ok yeah yeah but there's one text that

0:11:12	SPEAKER_02
 is on here ok

0:11:16	SPEAKER_00
 that's the one that you use if you search for a page like 700 and it's counting from 100 to 200 you will switch to your television

0:11:30	SPEAKER_01
 and back yeah but then you can switch back to normal

0:11:36	SPEAKER_03
 you just switch it off

0:11:38	SPEAKER_01
 and then just put it on the extra button and if you press it again you get the the stage is yeah but if you are in a second stage the third stage is switch teletext off so

0:11:56	SPEAKER_04
 you can switch back from

0:11:58	SPEAKER_00
 the second to turn off just remember where it was it doesn't clear the page if you turn teletext on you set the screen on it still stays ok ok

0:12:14	SPEAKER_03
 maybe it's not

0:12:16	SPEAKER_02
 the way

0:12:18	SPEAKER_00
 that's a functionality for the

0:12:20	None
 television yeah I think as well but

0:12:22	SPEAKER_01
 oh yeah that's maybe one yeah we can discuss about no the remote can send like the code for 700

0:12:34	SPEAKER_02
 page 700 to the television

0:12:36	SPEAKER_03
 if you switch it yeah that's true

0:12:40	SPEAKER_02
 yeah I know do we need to fix that

0:12:44	SPEAKER_00
 or those new TVs do collect all the pages yeah those memories not every

0:12:54	None
 television yeah this logo for volume yeah that's fine

0:13:02	None
 so that's it is this pretty much it yeah I thought about one thing

0:13:08	SPEAKER_00
 the buttons from which material are they now just like your telephone yeah just hard plastic because it's very expensive to make it from a different material if you use it a couple of years sometimes the numbers on the buttons are slide away and maybe we can describe the numbers below or above or shall we just turn it on the buttons I think just

0:13:38	SPEAKER_02
 if you do it above or below it takes

0:13:42	SPEAKER_00
 too much space

0:13:44	SPEAKER_02
 yeah I don't think just lays this for a

0:13:48	SPEAKER_01
 yeah I think you have a

0:13:50	SPEAKER_00
 problem more often with rubber buttons yeah we have rubber buttons okay fine

0:13:56	SPEAKER_03
 yeah okay

0:13:58	None
 yeah yeah I don't know what this means but I think we just evaluated this one

0:14:16	SPEAKER_00
 yeah I made some criteria okay you made some good evaluate or model okay I didn't don't think

0:14:26	None
 you have some usability criteria okay I know all the criteria as we just argue about

0:14:34	SPEAKER_00
 in the bottom look at feel

0:14:40	SPEAKER_01
 evaluation is

0:14:42	None
 yeah evaluation presentation it's not here

0:14:48	SPEAKER_00
 yeah

0:14:50	None
 yeah it's not here it doesn't matter it only had two pages or something well I looked in the reports from the marketing strategy or the new needs and the market, the Italians how they think about it and the research about the the the users and that kind of stuff and I made some criteria and we have to test the criteria from one to zero we can give it a number and then we can give herself an average for our model and these are all the same I found or I wrote down and we have to discuss

0:15:56	SPEAKER_03
 if we give it one or a seven I think if you have a kind of

0:16:02	SPEAKER_00
 I pulled idea why beautiful the difference between a beautiful fancy look and feel is the outside beautiful like the I pulled or something and the colors and that kind of stuff

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 I think if you can get the I-POP look then it's beautiful

0:16:26	SPEAKER_00
 yes what kind of basic colors where you thought of the basic colors are black or green or yellow

0:16:38	SPEAKER_02
 how do we make maybe a company colors

0:16:42	SPEAKER_03
 black

0:16:44	SPEAKER_00
 yellow light

0:16:46	SPEAKER_03
 no really

0:16:48	SPEAKER_02
 but just a bit of yellow black white maybe black white

0:16:56	SPEAKER_00
 and what colors should the buttons be

0:17:00	SPEAKER_03
 different colors the same as the cover

0:17:06	SPEAKER_01
 can you change those with the switch

0:17:10	SPEAKER_03
 just make them black

0:17:12	SPEAKER_02
 or grey just dark grey

0:17:16	SPEAKER_00
 what number do we give at beautiful is really subjective because it has to do lots with the colors we have changeable phones for everyone is something beautiful

0:17:32	SPEAKER_03
 give it one it's perfect

0:17:36	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's just what you want it's hard to decide for us it's a lot better than current for motor controls

0:17:44	SPEAKER_03
 okay just 52

0:17:48	SPEAKER_00
 okay the fancy look and feel that's about our flashing lights and the background lights from the buttons and we can change the colors so that's really fancy

0:18:02	SPEAKER_01
 one more thing are we changing are they on the slide panel or no backlight slide panel

0:18:14	SPEAKER_03
 no it's only on the behind the numbers

0:18:18	SPEAKER_01
 and the switch channel is

0:18:20	SPEAKER_03
 this here

0:18:22	SPEAKER_02
 yeah but it's on this here

0:18:24	SPEAKER_00
 it's pretty cool if you slide it open it lights up that's really fancy but I don't know if it's reachable

0:18:34	SPEAKER_02
 of course it's reachable then we do it maybe just some light to light it all up you can see what's really there not just on the buttons or something just the green light

0:18:50	SPEAKER_03
 or from blue light

0:18:52	SPEAKER_01
 just backlight not the buttons and the normal backlight also not the buttons behind the buttons

0:19:02	SPEAKER_02
 so the buttons are just great yeah that's only here

0:19:06	SPEAKER_00
 okay fine so I think it's very fancy

0:19:10	SPEAKER_02
 yeah so I've done a lot of detail in light

0:19:14	SPEAKER_00
 so yeah and you can also choose in light so

0:19:18	SPEAKER_03
 yeah this is one

0:19:20	SPEAKER_00
 I think this one

0:19:22	SPEAKER_03
 okay next this is a difficult one because we don't

0:19:26	SPEAKER_00
 we don't know about we should test it

0:19:30	SPEAKER_03
 it's very easy to use the second layer is not easy to use it's that's

0:19:36	SPEAKER_01
 no but you don't have to use that and you don't have to pay attention to that second layer that's the main thing

0:19:42	SPEAKER_02
 that's so good about

0:19:44	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's easy to use learnable it's not as fast as a usual remote control because I think the scroll wheel it's very handy but the first time you get this thing in your hands is not to use the scroll wheel see for it and up or down but the rest of it is very easy

0:20:04	SPEAKER_03
 because there's so

0:20:06	SPEAKER_02
 yeah I think it's very clear

0:20:08	SPEAKER_01
 so a few information that you can easily decide what buttons for what function

0:20:14	SPEAKER_02
 the second part like speech as that will be hard to learn so it is learnable

0:20:20	SPEAKER_03
 and first of all it's very easy to use and I think it's scroll wheel easy to use as well if you have ever used a different kind of yeah

0:20:32	SPEAKER_00
 we've got two or three new things and maybe learnable is in compare of old fashioned remote controls so we have speech scroll wheel and the slide you must slide it and that's not normal and a normal remote controls less than easy to use because

0:21:00	SPEAKER_03
 used use comes after manual

0:21:02	SPEAKER_02
 so just give it it to maybe it's free then learnable

0:21:06	SPEAKER_03
 no but definitely better than

0:21:10	SPEAKER_01
 normal then the one you showed is just all buttons

0:21:14	SPEAKER_02
 and you don't know then a tool

0:21:18	SPEAKER_03
 okay

0:21:20	SPEAKER_00
 new feature is technological innovative speech function and the new scroll wheel and the slide I think the slide is pretty new it's not new

0:21:34	SPEAKER_03
 I only saw it in a telephone not in a digital oh I already have a VCR and it's

0:21:40	SPEAKER_02
 from 1988 and the other

0:21:42	SPEAKER_00
 slide and it's also the buttons come out as well okay and the lightning is scroll wheel

0:21:52	SPEAKER_02
 different colors

0:21:54	SPEAKER_00
 yeah different fronts for remote control I think that's new too yeah so we have a pretty new yeah no games it's not a one it's a two again it's not LCD

0:22:06	SPEAKER_02
 we also have the home station we are forgetting about that now

0:22:10	SPEAKER_03
 oh yeah that's why

0:22:12	SPEAKER_01
 it's rechargeable

0:22:14	SPEAKER_02
 yeah we didn't draw that too

0:22:16	SPEAKER_03
 but that's more like now

0:22:18	SPEAKER_01
 yeah just draw it afterwards

0:22:20	SPEAKER_03
 it's a good thing if you can you save it on the same in the same map as the other ones

0:22:26	SPEAKER_02
 in the project map

0:22:28	SPEAKER_03
 just save save us save us

0:22:34	SPEAKER_01
 well it's already in the fall like number seven

0:22:38	SPEAKER_03
 yeah smart words yeah but this one this one is not yet in the I think it is

0:22:46	SPEAKER_01
 it's not in the yeah I think it is

0:22:50	SPEAKER_02
 run titles yeah it doesn't matter

0:22:54	SPEAKER_04
 save you still see the

0:22:58	SPEAKER_03
 all the research and you feature so we give it a two or also again a one no I think if you have games on it then you get one

0:23:08	SPEAKER_00
 we are not extra ordinary new

0:23:10	SPEAKER_03
 it's always still a two targeted audience we are the targeted audience

0:23:16	SPEAKER_00
 we we we we search for a young group

0:23:20	SPEAKER_03
 young enough 40 so we are exactly the targeted group

0:23:24	SPEAKER_00
 yeah but did we reach with our style the targeted audience

0:23:30	SPEAKER_03
 that's my question you get the fancy things for younger people and the aesthetic things for older people

0:23:36	SPEAKER_01
 we've got a one for fancy looking and that's what attracts the young audience so

0:23:42	SPEAKER_00
 yeah the only point is that we don't have that's already that's this question

0:23:52	SPEAKER_01
 yeah but that's basically not handy and I don't see yeah so we targeted it

0:24:02	SPEAKER_00
 but we didn't follow the latest trends

0:24:06	SPEAKER_01
 no yeah you could make a a front latest trends

0:24:12	SPEAKER_04
 a front

0:24:14	SPEAKER_00
 these are the only like the trend

0:24:18	SPEAKER_02
 or something all right

0:24:22	SPEAKER_00
 you get different different front yeah so we have like a fruit but then I'll kind of front but spongy will never be no so we give herself a three or something

0:24:38	SPEAKER_03
 yeah

0:24:40	SPEAKER_00
 let's what's the average?

0:24:46	SPEAKER_03
 11 divided by 6 yeah this is 1.83

0:24:54	SPEAKER_00
 upper, face score

0:24:56	SPEAKER_01
 no I don't know

0:24:58	SPEAKER_02
 we're not too hard on ourselves this is a power indicator okay you can see how far it's

0:25:04	SPEAKER_00
 charged up and then you need a button to go

0:25:10	SPEAKER_01
 oh yeah that's still yeah but we have to make a speaker

0:25:14	SPEAKER_03
 then too if you want to make it

0:25:16	SPEAKER_01
 be maybe we have to skip that one that's no one's in but we can do it underneath the logo

0:25:24	SPEAKER_02
 if you do a speaker is very small as well yeah okay

0:25:30	SPEAKER_03
 so I just got a financial so um

0:25:38	SPEAKER_01
 you saved it

0:25:40	SPEAKER_00
 yeah I did save it

0:25:52	SPEAKER_03
 okay let's have a look at this one here the production cost of it if I forgot anything it's just a battery yeah there are some things that they didn't mention because recharge is not on the list okay so I think we are pretty much in the right direction because it's 12.3 euro

0:26:14	SPEAKER_01
 okay but it's uh

0:26:18	SPEAKER_03
 so this is a regolith ship and uh as sample speaker okay so that's both

0:26:24	SPEAKER_00
 no that's perfect uh 12.3

0:26:26	SPEAKER_03
 yeah and single curve

0:26:28	SPEAKER_01
 does it include a home station or no that's not on the list

0:26:32	SPEAKER_03
 but can we make that for uh

0:26:34	SPEAKER_01
 20 cents yeah we can probably

0:26:38	SPEAKER_03
 I just the button I was wondering if this special color maybe was um different fonts

0:26:46	SPEAKER_02
 but standard font

0:26:48	SPEAKER_03
 I think special for yeah it's hard to say but maybe we have to yeah what is okay special color you can skip this one because it's all quite normal you get different ones at all so you can put the recharge in but this is expensive the sample speaker

0:27:10	SPEAKER_00
 yeah yeah it's four it's four euros

0:27:16	SPEAKER_02
 oh damn is that uh included it's 12 euro so yeah that's

0:27:22	SPEAKER_01
 kind of weird that we have some information now afterwards

0:27:28	SPEAKER_03
 yeah no okay so this is pretty much head this way damn solace so uh what's just I just want to yeah we just made it so we can do the projects if your evaluation now for

0:27:46	SPEAKER_00
 everything together

0:27:48	SPEAKER_03
 okay we can do some discussion about this what's the room for creativity sure yes okay both the room for creativity

0:28:20	SPEAKER_02
 yeah thanks I think everyone just shared already

0:28:26	SPEAKER_01
 yeah if we got a high mark for innovativeness or innovativity

0:28:36	SPEAKER_02
 we probably have been not afraid about it

0:28:40	SPEAKER_00
 yeah we could make a lot of different remote controls yeah so it's creativity okay so

0:28:50	None
 the leadership wasn't the real leadership then of course there was okay what do you have to say about that no

0:29:02	SPEAKER_02
 yeah

0:29:04	SPEAKER_03
 yeah yeah yeah

0:29:10	SPEAKER_01
 yeah just normal discussion I think not yeah one leader or something one leader to

0:29:22	SPEAKER_02
 check the time

0:29:24	SPEAKER_01
 yeah and make notes

0:29:26	SPEAKER_03
 yeah I know

0:29:28	SPEAKER_02
 so more like a secretary

0:29:32	None
 yeah okay next one teamwork the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard you were not all agree with that

0:29:48	SPEAKER_01
 we had so much information that we get through email

0:29:52	SPEAKER_02
 and just we got the wrong information at the wrong time I think that was the biggest problem like the prices if you knew that before we could

0:30:06	SPEAKER_00
 get really quicker yeah because the prices could be 20 euro

0:30:12	SPEAKER_02
 something that if you had 15 euro then we would discourage

0:30:18	SPEAKER_03
 yeah

0:30:20	SPEAKER_01
 yeah finance so we're basically just

0:30:24	SPEAKER_03
 lucky to get the price right

0:30:26	SPEAKER_00
 but the team wearables okay yeah everybody could speak their opinion

0:30:32	SPEAKER_02
 I think everyone listen to each other yeah like marketing then we have to include them in the design

0:30:40	SPEAKER_03
 yeah okay yeah what I have to say about

0:30:46	None
 means the smart board is okay did you pen is horrible and if you use it but if you want to download it

0:30:54	SPEAKER_02
 to your computer it doesn't work digital pen smart board would be very very good

0:31:04	SPEAKER_01
 yeah it would be faster

0:31:06	SPEAKER_00
 it would be

0:31:08	SPEAKER_02
 more hard to make yeah it should be more accurate precise and I think it would be great if you could edit it from just with a mouse when

0:31:22	SPEAKER_03
 it's hitting yeah not just

0:31:28	SPEAKER_01
 it's the same for the presentation

0:31:30	None
 yeah no use to draw on the board itself it's just

0:31:38	SPEAKER_01
 just closed out yeah just old-fashioned kind of blackboard style but you might as well do it in normal computer style

0:31:48	SPEAKER_02
 yeah even hard to draw like this then blackboard
