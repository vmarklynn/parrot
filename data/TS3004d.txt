0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 you should please want to sit down and show you it's not safe yet okay

0:00:13	SPEAKER_02
 so oh beautiful drawing

0:00:40	SPEAKER_03
 this is our agenda you you're going to show your prototype presentation after Oh, I didn't. Oh, yeah. So these are the...

0:00:58	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, okay. Yeah. So these are the last notes we made. If anything doesn't look right, just say it to me. I don't have to put it in the report.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_02
 You know, we're doing the speech recognition because we didn't have enough time to design

0:01:25	SPEAKER_03
 the inside as well. Okay, but still possible financially. So if you want to... Okay, yeah, well then we're going to put it in. Okay, just...

0:01:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, just... we have to design the inside then, but the...

0:01:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, or are we making a slide open like underneath or full open?

0:01:43	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know. Slide open is quite useful for remote control.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so like underneath you can slide it open. You can...

0:01:52	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe that's stronger as well. Yeah, it's... it's very important.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, I think that's better. Well, and you have a lot of room inside, so you can make it very easy to use.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_02
 Because you can write a lot of comments besides it. Okay, so this is okay, I'll go to.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so we're going to use advanced chips then. Okay, so that's...

0:02:14	SPEAKER_03
 Just look how much that is. But... Okay, for the... Yeah, I think so.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know. No, you have a different chip for speech recognition.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget, so it's okay.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_02
 Good.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_03
 So you can show your prototype if you want to.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, together. Yeah, let's do it together. I'll give comments. Okay.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_01
 We just made a word file with the basic elements.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_01
 The look and feel model. Well, the form, the case, as drawn there, simply a square with round corners.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_01
 So that's basically it. The material should be hard plastic. Color are changeable and also transparent.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_01
 And color and transparent or just transparent, I don't know.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_01
 Then the elements.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_01
 So we have... The functions are just basic. Like I've pointed them here. Mute function, on off function, text functions.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_01
 This is the switch channel. Okay, cool. And this is the numpad.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_01
 And the logo is over here and the mic. Okay. And the scroll will now...

0:03:58	SPEAKER_01
 You operate that with your pointing finger. So you hold it like this in your right hand.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_03
 So how many things do you need for the microphone?

0:04:09	SPEAKER_03
 Speech recognition. Yeah, speech recognition. There's only one button to say.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't have a specification of that, but I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, maybe you have to configure it.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, you need options to configure it. And after that you don't need them anymore.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_03
 So you can put it on the back as well? Yeah, you can all...

0:04:32	SPEAKER_01
 Or on the slides function, I don't know. Okay.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we haven't had time to design that. The slides...

0:04:39	SPEAKER_02
 We also don't know how many buttons are required or what kind of buttons, but...

0:04:45	SPEAKER_02
 You have a lot of room if you can slide it open.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you can put this. I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, enough room.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_01
 The position. Yeah, you're right. You wrote this.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_02
 The main Zab buttons are most central. This was the most important thing.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_02
 So best replace, best reach place.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_02
 The on-off buttons, text buttons, mute buttons, are together.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_02
 And at the place they usually are. Easy to find.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_02
 The on-off button is a bit bigger. So it stands out.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_02
 That's why you don't have to make it right because it will show up.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_02
 Score wheels on the left side. It's basically the standard place for score wheels.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but it's not impossible to use it if you're left handed.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, because you can use your thumb then.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_00
 Just one thing now. You need to have more. You've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_00
 But you missed the zero and the two tries.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_04
 That's all I had. I'm just sorry to get that.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but it's rather important.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we just missed that.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_02
 Well, just, I'll get back to later.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_02
 The forum, well, you have taken that from the iPod, other appropriate technical device. So it should be popular.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_02
 The buttons creating, if you, that are all round shapes, not around these corners.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so now you got a bit round feeling.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_02
 No use hard plastic since that allows us to use 2D buttons, non rubber buttons.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_02
 Color changeable, more on the backlight thing, the thing that lights up.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_02
 We have decided in the channel buttons, there's a little color around it.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. And also in the numpad, there's also color of light behind it.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_03
 And do you still can choose what color you want?

0:07:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. How do you want to implement that?

0:07:15	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe on the second level as well?

0:07:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, these are just basic functions. So all the non basic.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, just roll the second level because we need that as well.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, there's one function I use daily and it's not on the basic functions.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's to switch to your SCART, PlayStation or DVD player.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, maybe we use this button for that.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, maybe or you can lay it beneath in the other area.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, as well. Just make a video device.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_03
 Just draw second level one and say all the options that are still left or something.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_03
 A second level like new.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_03
 No, just down there.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_01
 How does the second level come out?

0:08:03	SPEAKER_00
 It slides on the slides I think.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, maybe from the, you can do it as it claps open, but I think that's not solid.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_02
 No, you've got a slide.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's right.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_02
 So it doesn't even have to slide all the way up.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_02
 So what do we need?

0:08:21	SPEAKER_02
 To slide the speech functions buttons.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, just menu.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_02
 Menu button with maybe arrows.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_02
 So you can roll in the navigate menu.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, SCART.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_02
 SCART.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_02
 I think we can even put, we have one for zero and one for the more digit.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_02
 So you have one left.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_02
 So this is the video channel, PlayStation, etc. that's used pretty often.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but you have to play a session.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_02
 You use it every day.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_00
 Basic.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_01
 External or something.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_03
 You want to save the files, Val?

0:09:19	SPEAKER_03
 Draw in.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_01
 So here are multiple speech buttons.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know how many.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_01
 Doesn't really matter.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't really matter.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_02
 We don't have any.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_02
 What else?

0:09:35	SPEAKER_02
 What else menu buttons?

0:09:36	SPEAKER_02
 What's the name?

0:09:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's an navigate.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_00
 With arrows.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what things best if we do.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_02
 Where do I have?

0:09:48	SPEAKER_01
 Like a normal.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_02
 Like on the normal.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_02
 Like this.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, within the middle of a menu button.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_02
 Well, you don't have any anything on how many buttons, speech, who cries.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_02
 So it can't really design that.

0:10:06	None
 Okay.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe one button to switch the color of your lats.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yep.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_00
 And you can hold it.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_00
 You can hold it.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_00
 And then the color switch or multiple.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_02
 Just press again, the color switch again, maybe.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, we just make it three buttons.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_03
 All the colors on it.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_03
 Red.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_00
 If we have enough place and then we can do that.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_00
 We can put those here.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_00
 Color buttons.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_00
 And then we choose green, blue and red.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_00
 That's.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_01
 So did we miss anything?

0:10:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe some text.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_02
 Some text.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_02
 That's the whole wheel that it is.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_00
 But I just heard the volume logo.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_00
 There's one.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_00
 There's one text.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, one.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_00
 There's now or it's written.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_00
 I prefer that's the one that you use if you search for a page, like 700.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_00
 And it's counting from 100 to 200.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_00
 You will switch to your television and back.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_01
 Do you think of that?

0:11:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_01
 But then you can switch back to normal teletext.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_01
 You just switch it off and then.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_03
 I just put it on the text.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we thought of text button.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_01
 And if you press it again, you get the.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_01
 The state.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_01
 The state.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_01
 The state.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_01
 But if you're in a second stage, the third stage is switched teletext off.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_01
 So you can switch back from second to first.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_00
 Just remember where it was.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't clear the page.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_00
 If you turn teletext on, you set 700 and you turn it off.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_00
 Then the next time you turn it on, it still stays on.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it's not the way.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_03
 That's a functionality for the television.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_02
 I think as well.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_00
 That's maybe one.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_01
 No, we can discuss.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_01
 The remote can send like the code for 700, page 700 to the television.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_01
 If you switch it off.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_03
 But you have to search every time again.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_03
 That's what's happening if you do it like that.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_02
 It's true.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_02
 It's still television.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_02
 It's not good.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_00
 Do we need to fix that or?

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 No, that's what it is.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_00
 You collect all the pages.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, those memories.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_00
 Not every television.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 This logo for volume.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:01	None
 That's fine.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_03
 So, that's it.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_03
 This is pretty much it.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 I thought about one thing.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_00
 The buttons from each material already.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_00
 No, just like your telephone.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_00
 Just hard plus.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_00
 It's expensive to make it from a different material.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_00
 If you use it a couple of years, sometimes the numbers on the buttons are a slight away.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_00
 And maybe we can describe the numbers below or above or shall we just turn it on the buttons.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_02
 I think just if you do it above or below, it takes...

0:13:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's too much place.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_02
 I would just think just lays this for a few times.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_01
 I think you have a problem more often with rubber buttons.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, with rubber buttons.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:54	None
 Okay.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_00
 Fine.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I don't know what this means, but I think we just evaluated this one.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I made some criteria.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_00
 You made some good.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_00
 I did it.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think if it's right.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_00
 Did I shall show it?

0:14:27	None
 I don't think I'm going to show it.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, I'm going to show it.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_00
 You have some usability criteria.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_00
 Uh-huh.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, no.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_00
 All criteria as we just argue about.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_03
 In the bottom.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_01
 Look, I feel.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_01
 Evaluation.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, evaluation presentation.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_00
 There is no thing.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't matter.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_00
 It only had two pages or something.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_00
 Well I looked in the reports from the marketing strategy or of the new needs and the market, the Italians, how they think about it.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_00
 The research about the users and that kind of stuff.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_00
 I made some criteria and we have to test the criteria from 1 to 0.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_00
 We can give it a number and then we can give ourselves an average for our model.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_00
 These are all I found or I wrote down and we have to discuss about if we give it one or a seven.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_03
 I think if you have a kind of eye-paught idea, why beautiful?

0:16:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, the difference between a beautiful, fancy look and feel is the outside, beautiful like the eye-paught or something and fancy is more like the flashing lights and the colors.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_00
 That kind of stuff.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_02
 I think if you can get the eye-paught look, then it's beautiful.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_00
 What kind of basic colors are black or green or yellow?

0:16:37	SPEAKER_02
 How do we make company colors?

0:16:42	SPEAKER_03
 Just black.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_00
 Black and yellow.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yellow light.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_03
 No, not really but it's possible.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_02
 No, not yellow light but just a bit of yellow.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_02
 Black white, maybe.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_02
 Black white also light.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_00
 What colors should the buttons be?

0:16:59	SPEAKER_00
 Because...

0:17:00	SPEAKER_03
 Different colors.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_03
 Just the same as the cover.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_03
 But also the light.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_01
 Can you change those too?

0:17:08	SPEAKER_01
 With the switch?

0:17:09	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_03
 Just make them black or gray or something.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_02
 Just dark gray I think.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so what number do we give a beautiful?

0:17:21	SPEAKER_00
 Beautiful is really subjective because it has to do lots with the colors.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_00
 We have changeable phones.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_00
 Changeable phones for everyone is something beautiful.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, just give it a one.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_03
 It's okay, it's perfect.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's just what you want or not.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_02
 It's hard to decide for us but...

0:17:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_02
 It's a lot better than current remote controls.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, just give it a two.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_00
 The fancy look and feel.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_00
 That's about our flashing lights and the background lights from the buttons.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_00
 And we can change the colors so that's really fancy I think.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_01
 One more thing.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_01
 Are they back lights on the slide panel too or no back light?

0:18:11	SPEAKER_01
 Slide panel?

0:18:12	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's only on the number, behind the number.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_01
 And the switch channel is...

0:18:18	SPEAKER_01
 Or it's back light.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_01
 I mean this here.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but it's not necessary.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_02
 What do I think is necessary?

0:18:23	SPEAKER_00
 It's pretty cool if you slide it open.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_00
 It lights up.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_00
 That's really fancy but I don't know if it's reachable.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_02
 Of course it's reachable.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't make...

0:18:36	SPEAKER_02
 Then we do it.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, maybe just some light to light it all up.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_02
 So you can see what's really there.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_02
 Not just not on the buttons or something.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_02
 Just green light or from blue light to light it all up.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_01
 But yeah, just back light.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_01
 Not the buttons.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_01
 And the normal back lights also not the buttons but behind the buttons.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_01
 So the buttons are just gray.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_02
 So yeah, semi-transparent.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's fine.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, fine.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_00
 So I think it's very fancy.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_02
 So I've done a lot of detail in light.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and you can also choose in light.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, this is one.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_03
 It's okay.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_00
 I think this one.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, next.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_03
 This is a difficult one because we don't know.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_00
 We don't know about the...

0:19:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we should test it.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_03
 It's very easy to use but the second layer is not easy to use.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_01
 No, but you don't have to use that and you don't have to pay attention to that second layer.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_01
 That's the main thing that's so good about it.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's easy to use and learn about this.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_00
 Learnable.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_00
 It's not as fast as a usual remote control.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I think it is.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_00
 Because I think the scroll wheel is very handy.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_00
 But the first time you get this thing in your hands is not to use the scroll wheel.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_00
 I think you must seek for it and up or down or...

0:20:03	SPEAKER_03
 But the rest of it is very easy because there's so...

0:20:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think it's very clear.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_01
 So a few information that you can easily decide what buttons for what function.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_02
 The second part is like speech.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_02
 That will be hard to learn.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_03
 So it is learnable.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_03
 First place is very easy to use.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's scroll wheels is easy to use as well.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_03
 If you have ever used a different kind of...

0:20:30	SPEAKER_00
 We've got two or three new things.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe learnable is in a compare of old fashioned remote controls.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_00
 So we have speech, the scroll wheel and the slide.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_00
 And that's not normal at normal remote controls.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_00
 I think learnable is less than easy to use because easy to use comes after learnable.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, easy to use is very cool.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_02
 So just give it a two.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe a three then learnable.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_03
 No, but it's definitely much better than...

0:21:09	SPEAKER_01
 Than normal.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_01
 Than one use showed is just all buttons and you don't know.

0:21:15	None
 Yeah, true.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_02
 Than a two.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_00
 New features.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_00
 The speed function and the score.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_00
 The speed function.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_00
 The scroll wheel and the slide.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_00
 I think the slide is not new.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_00
 The slide is not new.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_00
 I only saw it in a telephone.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_03
 I already have VCR and it's from 1988 and the layer of the slide.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_02
 Also why the buttons come out as well.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_00
 And the lightning.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_00
 Is that new?

0:21:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, for lightning.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_00
 The scroll wheel.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_00
 The new I think.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_00
 Speech.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_00
 Speech is new.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_02
 Different colors.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, different fronts for remote control.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's new too.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_00
 So we have a pretty new one.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, no games on it.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_00
 It's not a one.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_00
 It's a two again.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_00
 It's not LCD or something.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_02
 We also have the home station.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_02
 We are forgetting about that now.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_02
 Oh yeah.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_03
 That's very chargeable.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we didn't draw that too.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_03
 But that's more like now.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, just draw it afterwards.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, just a normal simple thing.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_03
 If you can you save it on the same map as the other ones.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_03
 In the project map.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_02
 Just save?

0:22:28	SPEAKER_03
 Save us?

0:22:29	None
 Mm-hmm.

0:22:30	None
 Save us?

0:22:31	SPEAKER_03
 No, that's not the other one.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it's already in the folder.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_01
 Like number seven.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_03
 Oh yeah, okay.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_03
 Smart words.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_03
 This one is not yet in the...

0:22:43	SPEAKER_03
 I think it is.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_03
 It's not in the area.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_01
 Click click.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it is.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_02
 I think it is.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_02
 I'm titled.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it doesn't matter.

0:22:53	None
 Okay.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_04
 These delts are all the resources.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_03
 They're all the same.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_03
 And your features, so we give it a two or also again a one.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_03
 No, I think if you have games on it, then you have one.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_00
 We are not extraordinary new or something.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_03
 No, that's so true.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_03
 Two, I think.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_03
 Targeted audience.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_03
 We are the targeted audience.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_03
 Do we like it?

0:23:16	SPEAKER_00
 No, we search for a young group.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but we need 40.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_00
 Young enough 40.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_03
 We are exactly the targeted group.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but did we reach with our style, the targeted audience?

0:23:29	SPEAKER_00
 That's my question.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_03
 I think so, yeah.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_03
 You get the fancy things for younger people and you get the aesthetic things for older people.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_01
 We've got a one for fancy looking feel and that's what attracts the young audience.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's the only point that we don't have.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_00
 That's already, that's this question.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but that's basically not handy and I don't see.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so we targeted it.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_00
 But we didn't follow the latest trends.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you could make a front.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_01
 I think you've got the latest trends.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_04
 A front.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_00
 These are the only latest trends I have.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_00
 That's on my computer.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_02
 Well, fruit and vegetables.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you get different colors.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_02
 You get different fronts.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so we have fruit.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_00
 Banana kind of front.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_00
 But Spongy will never be.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_00
 So we give ourselves a three or something.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_00
 Oh.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_03
 So that's eleven.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_00
 That's...

0:24:45	SPEAKER_00
 What's that for?

0:24:46	SPEAKER_00
 Eleven divided by six.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, this is one point eight three.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_00
 Up, perfect score.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_00
 No, I don't know.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_01
 We're not too hard on ourselves.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_02
 We have a power indicator.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, you can see how far it's charged up.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_00
 And then you need a button to call it, to let it be, to call.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah, that's still there.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but we have to make a speaker then too, if you want to make it be.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you have to skip that one.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_01
 No, I don't want that in.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_01
 But we can do it underneath the logo.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_01
 That's usable.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_01
 If you do it...

0:25:24	SPEAKER_02
 It's really useful.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the speaker is very small as well.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_03
 So I just got a financial...

0:25:37	SPEAKER_01
 Is it safe to say that?

0:25:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_00
 I did save it.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so if I look at this one here, the production costs of it.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_03
 If I forgot anything, say it to me, just the battery.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, there are some things that they didn't mention because recharge is not on the list.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_03
 But okay.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we are pretty much in the right direction because it's 12.3 euros.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_03
 So this is a regular chip and a sample speaker.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_03
 So that's both.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_00
 No, that's perfect.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_00
 12.3.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_03
 And single curve it.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_01
 But does it include a home station or...?

0:26:31	SPEAKER_03
 No, that's not on the list.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_01
 Can we make that for 20 cents?

0:26:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we can.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_01
 Probably.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_03
 I just...

0:26:39	SPEAKER_03
 The button supplements.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_03
 I was wondering if this special color maybe was...

0:26:44	SPEAKER_02
 Different fonts, but standard font.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_02
 It's special form.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_03
 It's hard to say.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_03
 But maybe we have to...

0:26:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's okay.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_03
 Special color, you can skip this one because it's all quite normal.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_03
 You get different ones at all.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_03
 So you can put a recharge here as well.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_03
 But this is expensive, the sample speaker.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's four euros.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, damn.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_02
 Is that included?

0:27:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's included.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_01
 It's kind of weird that we get this information now afterwards.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I know.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so this is pretty much it this morning.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_03
 Damn, solo sales.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_03
 So I just want to...

0:27:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we just made it so we can do the project if you're evaluation now for everything together.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_03
 We can do some discussion about this.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_03
 What's that room for creativity?

0:28:03	SPEAKER_03
 Sure.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_03
 But what's the room for creativity?

0:28:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think so.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_02
 I think everyone shared their ideas.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, if we got an eye mark for innovativeness or innovativity.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, definitely.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_02
 I think we probably have a lot of things about it.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_00
 We could make a lot of different remote controls.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_00
 So it's creativity.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so the leadership was the real leadership.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_02
 Of course the worst.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_03
 What do you have to say about that?

0:29:09	SPEAKER_01
 Just a little bit.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_01
 Just normal discussion, I think.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_01
 One leader or something?

0:29:19	SPEAKER_02
 One leader to check the time.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_01
 And make notes.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I know.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_02
 So more like a secretary.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, next one.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_03
 Teamwork.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_03
 The third meeting, I think that one was pretty hard.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_03
 We were not, we were not, we were not, yeah, agree with that.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_01
 We had so much information that we get through email and just.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_02
 I think we got the wrong information at the wrong time.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_02
 I think that was the biggest problem.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_02
 Like the prices.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_02
 If you knew that before we could have.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's the question really, really quicker.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because the prices could be 20 euro or something.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_02
 And if we had 50 euros, then we would just screw it.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_01
 Finance.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_01
 So we're basically just locking to get the price, right?

0:30:25	SPEAKER_03
 But the team work was okay.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, everybody could speak their opinion.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_02
 I think everyone listened to each other.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_02
 Like marketing said, then we had to include them in the design.

0:30:40	None
 Yeah.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, what I have to say about means, the smart board is okay.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_03
 Did you paint is horrible?

0:30:49	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if you use it, but if you want to download it to your computer, it doesn't work.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it just doesn't work.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_00
 Digital pen.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_02
 Smart board would be very nice to work with.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_02
 If it's worked really well.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it would be faster.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_00
 We're drowning for a more accurate...

0:31:07	SPEAKER_02
 It's hard to make, I think.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_02
 It should be more accurate, precise.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_02
 And I think it would be great if you could edit it from just with a mouse, from where it's hitting.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_02
 Not just pointing out.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_03
 It's the same for the presentation you can do from here.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_03
 That's my cheese, and it's standing there.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_03
 And see...

0:31:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'm just pointing with a mouse.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_02
 No use to draw on the board itself.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_02
 It just slows down.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_01
 Just old fashioned kind of blackboard style.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_01
 You might as well do it in normal computer style.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, even harder to draw.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_02
 Like a blackboard style.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_01
 And it's far too slow this way.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_02
 You could draw on it, but not as main function.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_03
 I just, I think.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_00
 Just a pen.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_03
 So we made it in time.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_03
 We made a remote control.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_03
 We did it.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_03
 In the budget, yeah.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_02
 New ideas found.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_00
 New ideas.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_00
 What's that?

0:32:25	SPEAKER_03
 Four, four, four.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what you mean.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_02
 I just think if you...

0:32:31	SPEAKER_00
 To gather or to work together on new ideas for...

0:32:39	SPEAKER_03
 For remote control, probably.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_03
 No, for the project.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_02
 For remote, though.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_02
 The favorites for your text.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_00
 No, for the prototype.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_00
 New ideas.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but still you couldn't make a fancy...

0:33:00	SPEAKER_01
 You couldn't make a prototype out of this because we don't have any sizes and...

0:33:06	SPEAKER_03
 Well, but it's for the next team.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_01
 What did you do?

0:33:10	SPEAKER_01
 You can possibly do that in such a short time, I think.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, just the ID phase, though.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_01
 Just brainstorming, basically.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_02
 Details.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_01
 So, are we finished?

0:33:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I think just write a final report.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, quite early.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_03
 No, we have only four minutes left, so it's okay.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, okay.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_02
 What do we have to do then?

0:33:58	SPEAKER_02
 We were done at four o'clock.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_01
 It's now quarter past three.

0:34:05	None
 Yeah.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_00
 I should take some pictures.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_02
 We can do it afterwards.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_00
 Let's play minesweeper.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I found it as well.

0:34:24	None
 Tiddin' to...

0:34:29	SPEAKER_02
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven cameras.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_01
 Not bad.

0:34:56	None
 I don't know why.

0:35:07	None
 Okay.

0:35:09	None
 Oh, it's very bad, but the yes is a little Pollock.

0:35:17	None
 It's aARuse.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_02
 We'll see it.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_01
 Now we can look at this.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_01
 This is?

0:36:40	SPEAKER_01
 We're probably not supposed to look at this.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_02
 The old versions.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, from the previous group.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_02
 They went for...

0:36:53	SPEAKER_02
 Touch device.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but also different devices.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_02
 Then the LCD would be handy.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_01
 Here are the basic functions.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_01
 Here are the selecting of devices.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the touch means for all that stuff.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_02
 I do agree with that.

0:37:18	None
 Yeah, to do...

0:37:25	None
 English is not so hard, by the way.

0:37:30	None
 No.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_02
 I'm breaking a girl's record here.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_00
 Come on, leader.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just...

0:37:56	SPEAKER_02
 I've got a problem, Paul.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_02
 You do?

0:38:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_02
 You have to make a choice?

0:38:10	SPEAKER_00
 No, I choose a choice.

0:38:11	SPEAKER_02
 Whoa, that's pretty quick.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_00
 Ta-da.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_00
 Just take one.

0:38:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, to the side.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_02
 It's the lower one.

0:38:25	SPEAKER_02
 What's this?

0:38:26	SPEAKER_00
 A bomber.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_02
 The upper one is the bomb.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_02
 This is the bomb.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:38:33	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_02
 Shit.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_00
 I knew it.

0:38:36	SPEAKER_00
 I knew it.

0:38:41	SPEAKER_00
 Four in a row.

0:38:49	SPEAKER_02
 No, that's too much work.

0:38:57	SPEAKER_00
 Come on.

0:39:04	SPEAKER_00
 Is that previous work?

0:39:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, this one.

0:39:07	SPEAKER_02
 I challenge you.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, that's so stupid.

0:39:19	SPEAKER_00
 No, that doesn't work.

0:39:21	SPEAKER_02
 No, you've got to use the magic pen.

0:39:26	SPEAKER_02
 What if I put one...

0:39:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's stupid.

0:39:36	SPEAKER_02
 We'll see.

0:39:37	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:39:43	SPEAKER_02
 I don't agree.

0:39:48	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry.

0:39:58	SPEAKER_02
 You had two choices.

0:40:06	SPEAKER_02
 That's going to be drawn.

0:40:14	SPEAKER_02
 Or not.

0:40:19	SPEAKER_00
 Too bad.

0:40:22	SPEAKER_02
 I'll put it here.

0:40:25	SPEAKER_04
 Then we're going to put it there.

0:40:28	SPEAKER_02
 Damn.

0:40:30	SPEAKER_02
 No one wins.

0:40:32	SPEAKER_02
 Difficult choice.

0:40:37	SPEAKER_01
 This is a very interesting design.

0:40:43	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure.

0:40:50	SPEAKER_00
 Me?

0:40:53	SPEAKER_01
 It's just the same as normal.

0:40:56	SPEAKER_02
 I had it done in the...

0:41:00	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it has a LCD.

0:41:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think.

0:41:05	SPEAKER_02
 Then do it correctly.

0:41:10	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, wait.

0:41:15	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to draw something.

0:41:20	SPEAKER_02
 What?

0:41:23	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, I'm going to guess what you're drawing.

0:41:27	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, blank.

0:41:30	SPEAKER_04
 No, not a new one.

0:41:37	SPEAKER_02
 A house.

0:41:42	SPEAKER_02
 You have to use the pen.

0:41:47	SPEAKER_02
 Not everything.

0:41:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, everything.

0:41:56	SPEAKER_02
 It wants to know what we do in our spare time.

0:42:01	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:42:02	SPEAKER_00
 It's a house.

0:42:06	SPEAKER_00
 I can know it.

0:42:11	SPEAKER_02
 It's a very hard to draw.

0:42:19	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, that makes it easier.

0:42:27	SPEAKER_02
 I think I know.

0:42:28	SPEAKER_02
 No, wrong.

0:42:35	SPEAKER_02
 I think I know what you're trying to draw, but it's wrong already.

0:42:40	SPEAKER_00
 It's very...

0:42:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you missed the right five.

0:42:54	None
 Oh, my God.

0:42:58	SPEAKER_00
 No, you're wrong.

0:43:02	SPEAKER_00
 A little bit, maybe.

0:43:19	SPEAKER_02
 See where you're wrong now?

0:43:22	SPEAKER_02
 The entrance.

0:43:25	SPEAKER_01
 Warning, finish meeting now.

0:43:28	SPEAKER_00
 All right, okay, the entrance is more to the left.

0:43:33	SPEAKER_00
 Warning, you're correct.

0:43:38	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but I think this part...

0:43:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but...

0:43:46	SPEAKER_00
 I think...

0:43:49	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, no, you made another mistake.

0:43:52	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah, there are a lot of mistakes because the walls are thick like this.

0:43:57	SPEAKER_02
 There's a big hole here as well.

0:44:01	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, that's true.

0:44:02	SPEAKER_02
 That's the kind of big mistake.

0:44:03	SPEAKER_00
 They're walking behind the walls.

0:44:07	SPEAKER_02
 Warning, finish meeting now.

0:44:11	SPEAKER_02
 Guys, I think we have to finish the meeting.

0:44:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:44:17	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, this is a hard one.

0:44:22	SPEAKER_01
 Warning, what does it say?

0:44:29	SPEAKER_01
 Fill in the questionnaire.

0:44:35	SPEAKER_01
 What now?

0:44:38	SPEAKER_02
 Come on.

0:44:43	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:44:48	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:44:52	SPEAKER_01
 No more chit-chat.

0:44:56	SPEAKER_02
 Over there.

0:45:01	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to be so lonely.

0:45:07	SPEAKER_00
 Clean that up later.

0:45:11	SPEAKER_00
 That's my exit face.

0:45:16	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to edit it smiley.

0:45:23	None
 Don't do it all.

0:45:31	SPEAKER_04
 Bye.

0:45:36	None
 Oh, God.

0:45:43	None
 Okay.

0:45:50	None
 Okay.
