0:04:35	SPEAKER_00
 Think of the user requirement specifications those things just refer to each of each of us. I think yeah, yeah

0:04:44	SPEAKER_03
 ID yeah

0:04:47	SPEAKER_02
 ID for the industrial designer, okay, and you ID for the user interface

0:04:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay marketing expert, it's me

0:04:55	SPEAKER_03

0:05:11	SPEAKER_03
 So you all know what's the parts of the work you have to do yeah, so which you the industrial designer

0:05:17	SPEAKER_01
 I am the industry and user interface design, okay, and you I am the industry design Okay, okay, so what's the difference between You the interface design when you have to know

0:05:35	SPEAKER_00
 Your job, so I hope you you know

0:05:37	SPEAKER_02
 You know, yeah, I think

0:05:43	SPEAKER_03
 Suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the

0:05:47	SPEAKER_01
 industrial way to make a user interface you You maybe you look just for it co-function

0:05:55	SPEAKER_02
 I think the user the user interface design is heavily designed how the user will use the relation between the user and Yeah, and the Industrial design it is how the object will look like maybe I think

0:06:10	SPEAKER_01
 The material is a function these how design the user interface you desire the function

0:06:17	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe just the outside in the inside

0:06:23	SPEAKER_00
 Okay

0:06:26	SPEAKER_02
 But I was thinking that it is a user to the user interface to design for example where the button will be you know Yeah, I don't know

0:06:34	SPEAKER_00
 You know

0:06:36	SPEAKER_02
 I am the industry designer. Okay, okay, not the other Okay So and the marketing expert

0:06:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I'm just gonna I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then this would I guess converge to the user interface designer and then

0:06:58	SPEAKER_03
 Industry that design and when designing you the remote control just remember that it has to be a kind of international product So you don't have to do something really specific As every day everybody will have to use it is the same as keyboards You know you have QWERTY as ity French and UK keyboard So really the remote control to be International okay and not too expensive

0:07:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, at the simple as we want to

0:07:25	SPEAKER_00
 Maximize the benefit and you have to keep it under 12 euros and

0:07:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah to keep in mind that that's the product cost won't be max more than 12 dot 50 euros, okay

0:07:39	None
 and To be sure that really people would be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the Existing remote controls now So is it okay? Hmm? It's clear

0:08:00	SPEAKER_02
