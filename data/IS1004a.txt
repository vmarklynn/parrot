0:00:00	None
 You don't need to know about my health.

0:00:30	None
 Good morning everybody.

0:00:32	None
 Good morning.

0:00:34	None
 Good morning.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, everybody's not ready.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_01
 Almost.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, let's go.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_01
 So we're here today to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to talk about it in a few minutes.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_01
 So I would be Sebastian, the project manager.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_01
 You are?

0:01:02	SPEAKER_01
 Michael, I'm the user interface designer.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_02
 I'm Guillermo Nadega.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_02
 I'm the marketing expert.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_02
 And I'm Hammond, the industrial designer.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, very good.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_01
 Thanks for being here.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_01
 So let's have a look to the head-gender.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_01
 So we are going to go through this agenda and mainly first to be used to the tools available.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_01
 This is nice and smart meeting room we have here.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_01
 Then we'll go to the planned project and have general discussions about it.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_01
 So the goal of this project is to give up a new remote control.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_01
 It should be original, trendy, and also user friendly.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_01
 As usual, we will follow the project method that we are using in our company.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_01
 It is in three steps, as you know.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_01
 First, the functional design, the second, the conceptual design, and then the detailed design.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_01
 During each step of each design, you will work separately, individually, on your specific tasks, and we will meet to discuss and take decisions about what you did and what we will do next.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_01
 So first, we have to train ourselves with all the tools available in this nice meeting room, and particularly the whiteboard.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_01
 So we are going to go through the whiteboard and take some notes or do some drawings.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_01
 So we want to start.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_00
 I will let them know.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_00
 I don't really have a favourite animal, but I have one in mind.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_00
 I will tell you about the spider, because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of the whiteboard.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_00
 The spider lives in a web.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_00
 It has eight legs, and it can move all about the web in two dimensions.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_00
 Unless it is a three-dimensional web, which there are some spiders that live in.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_00
 They have a big ball of a web.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_00
 The other thing is some spiders can fly.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_00
 They have a web building material, but it acts like a parachute.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_00
 They can go and find new web somewhere else.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_00
 I think they did this in Charlotte's Web, that little book first, but at the end all the spiders kind of flew away.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_01
 They are interesting.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_01
 Guillermo, do you want to?

0:05:02	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know why, but when I was a child I wanted to be a panther.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_02
 Not a pink panther.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it is difficult to draw a panther.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_03
 It is a friendly panther.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it is happy because it just ate someone.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, I don't know what is the male or female.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_02
 I have watched that lion's hand is the female lion who has a hand.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_02
 I like it because it is fast and it is black as well.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_02
 It can hide itself very easily.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_02
 It looks like powerful.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_02
 I was a film about a black panther when I was a child.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_02
 I was in that age when everything was choking me a lot.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_02
 I like it.

0:07:11	None
 I like it.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_03
 This lapel is coming out once and a while.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_03
 It is not very strong.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_03
 Not the favorite animal, but I think I will draw elephant.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_03
 That is a problem.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_03
 Elephant goes like this.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_03
 It is a gem.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know whether there should be any distance or not.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_03
 I think this is the easiest.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_03
 Then we have it strong.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_03
 Something like this.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_03
 I am cute.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_03
 Sometimes they have a hump.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_03
 It seems that elephants are pretty friendly and they have one very important way, a different way of walking.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_03
 So, when they walk, wherever they are going to put their first feet, the second feet will always be.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_03
 When they come to that position, the third feet will be there.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_03
 That is the way they walk.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_03
 They are very peculiar about them.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_03
 None of the other animals walk like this.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_03
 They are very useful to human beings.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_03
 At least few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportation or something.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_03
 Or when they had to carry huge loads from one place to another.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_03
 Elephants were very useful.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_03
 They are found in usually the warm countries.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_03
 That is what I want to tell you about.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_00
 Is this an Indian or an African elephant?

0:09:33	SPEAKER_03
 There are two kinds of different Indian and African elephants.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_03
 Indian elephant is having one bump, and the African have two.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_03
 Then there is a difference in the trunk of the animals.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_03
 These elephants who are Indian.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_03
 For some elephants, the trunk is having one.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_01
 Do we have some message there?

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 We have to get you to go to the meeting.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_00
 We can discuss that offline.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_01
 We will discuss offline.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_01
 We will do another meeting on the head.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_01
 So, another important part of the project is about money.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_01
 And about finance.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_01
 We should target the same price of 25 euro for this remote control.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_01
 We should generate a profit of 50 million euros.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_01
 We should target an international market.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_00
 So, Chris asked one question.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_00
 Is this a standalone unit that we are going to be selling?

0:10:49	SPEAKER_00
 You already have a TV, but you are buying an extra remote control for something.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_01
 This is the next topic we have to discuss.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_01
 So, let's go to it.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_01
 So, we should decide which kind of remote control we want to go.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_01
 Should it be specific remote control to some specific device?

0:11:10	SPEAKER_01
 Should it be a universal one?

0:11:13	SPEAKER_01
 And extra.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_01
 So, I am waiting for your inputs very quickly because we have only three minutes to go.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well, so it seems the first thing that they have specified is the price based on how much profit we want to make, which seems to be a little strange if we don't know what the product is yet.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_00
 I guess if that's the requirement that we need to design the product to actually fit that price bracket.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_00
 So, I guess we need to find out what people are willing to pay for, what kind of product they are expecting for 25 euro.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_00
 It seems quite a lot for remote control.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, I think this is more a job to our market person.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_01
 So, it should be the topic of maybe the next meeting, just to have another view of this, in which they actually should go.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_01
 So, we need to close the meeting.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_01
 We'll have a new meeting soon.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_01
 And so, here are the work every of you have to do.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_01
 So, you have to work on the working design.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_01
 You have to work on the technical functions.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_01
 And you have to work on the user user requirements specs.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_01
 You will receive some information by mail as usual.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_01
 Thanks for coming today.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_01
 Thanks.

0:13:15	None
 Thank you.
