 Mersimicalina Мест Ok, let's go.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_01
 So we're here today to have our first kick off meeting about this new project.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to talk about in a few minutes.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_01
 So I would be Sebastian, the project manager.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_01
 You are...

0:01:04	SPEAKER_00
 Michael, I'm the user interface designer.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_02
 I'm Giger Mardarigia, I'm the marketing expert.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_03
 And I'm Haymond, the industrial designer.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_01
 Ok, very good.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_01
 Thanks for being here.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_01
 So let's have a look to the agenda.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_01
 So we are going to go through this agenda and mainly first to make...

0:01:29	SPEAKER_01
 to be used to the tools available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_01
 Then we'll go to the plan of the project and have general discussions about it.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_01
 So the goal of this project is to develop a new remote control.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_01
 It should be original, trendy, and also user friendly.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_01
 As usual, we will follow the project method that we are using in our company.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_01
 It is in three steps, as you know.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_01
 First, the functional design, the second, the conceptual design, and then the detailed design.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_01
 During each step of each design, you will work separately individually on your specific tasks.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_01
 And we will meet to discuss and take decisions about what you did and what we will do next.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_01
 So first, we have to train ourselves with all the tools available in this nice meeting room and particularly the whiteboard.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_01
 So we are going to go through the whiteboard and take some notes or do some drawings.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_01
 So we want to start.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_00
 I will explain this one.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_00
 I want to draw my favourite animal.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_00
 I don't really have a favourite animal, but I think I have one in mind.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_00
 I will tell you about the spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a whiteboard.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_00
 The spider lives in a web.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_00
 It has eight legs.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_00
 It can move all about the web in two dimensions.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_00
 Unless it is a three-dimensional web, which sometimes there are some spiders that live in a big ball of a web.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_00
 The other thing is that some spiders can fly.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_00
 They have a web-building material, but it acts like a parachute so they can go and find new web somewhere else.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_00
 I think they did this in the Charlotte's web, that movie, that was actually a book first, but at the end all the spiders flew away.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_01
 That's my animal.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_01
 Guillermo, do you want to?

0:05:05	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know why, but when I was a child I wanted to be a panther.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_03
 Not a pink panther, but it's very difficult to draw a panther.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_01
 It's a bit I don't like it.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_02
 It's a friendly panther.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it's happy because it just ate someone.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, honestly, I don't know what's his behavior.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if it's the male who hands or it's the female.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_02
 I think I've watched that lion didn't hunt, it's the female lion who hands.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_02
 I like it because it's fast and it's black as well, so it can hide itself very easily.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_02
 It looks like powerful, strong.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_02
 I watched a film about a black panther when I was a child.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_02
 I was in that age when everything was choking me a lot.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_03
 I don't like pink panther.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_02
 I like it.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_01
 Is it help?

0:07:29	SPEAKER_03
 This lapel is coming out once in a while.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_03
 That's not very strong.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_03
 It's not the favorite animal, but I think I'll draw elephant.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, thanks.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_03
 Elephant goes like this and it's a zoom.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know whether there should be any distance or not, but I think this is the easiest.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_03
 Then we have it strong.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_03
 Something like this.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_03
 I cute.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_03
 It's not so strong.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_03
 Sometimes they have a hump.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_03
 Elephants are friendly and they have a different way of walking.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_03
 Wherever they are going to put their first feet, the second feet will always be.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_03
 The third feet will be there.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_03
 That's very peculiar about them.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 They are very useful to human beings.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_03
 At least a few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportation or something.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_03
 When they had to carry huge loads from one place to another, elephants were very useful.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_03
 They are found in the warm countries.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_03
 They are the biggest terrestrial animals.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_03
 That's what I know about them.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_00
 Is this an Indian or an African elephant?

0:09:33	SPEAKER_03
 There are two kinds of different Indian and African elephants.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_03
 Indian elephants have one bump and the African have two.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_03
 There is a difference in the trunk of the animals.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_03
 These elephants are Indian.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_03
 For some elephants, the trunk is having one.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_01
 Do we have some message there?

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 We have to cut you.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_01
 We will discuss that offline.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_01
 We will do another meeting of the elephants.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_01
 Another important part of the project is about money and about finance.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_01
 We should target a price of 25 euros for this remote control.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_01
 We should generate a profit of 50 million euros.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_01
 We should target an international market.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_00
 One question.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_00
 Is this a standalone unit that we are going to be selling?

0:10:49	SPEAKER_00
 You already have a TV but you are buying an extra remote control for something.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_01
 This is the next topic we have to discuss.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_01
 We should decide which kind of remote control we want to go.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_01
 We should be specific remote control to some specific device.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_01
 Should be a universal one and an extra.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_01
 I am waiting for your inputs very quickly because we have only three minutes to go.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_00
 It seems that the first thing that they have specified is the price based on how much profit we want to make.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_00
 It seems to be a little strange if we do not know what the product is.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_00
 If that is the requirement that we need to design the product to actually fit that price bracket.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_00
 We need to find out what people are willing to pay for.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_00
 What kind of product they are expecting for 25 euros.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_00
 It seems quite a lot for remote control.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_01
 I think this is more a job to our market person.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_01
 It should be the topic of the next meeting.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_01
 We have another view of this.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_01
 We need to close the meeting.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_01
 We will have a new meeting soon.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_01
 We have to work on the working design.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 We have to work on the technical functions.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_01
 We have to work on user requirements.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_01
 You will receive some information by mail as usual.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_01
 Thanks for coming today.

0:13:13	None
 Thank you for watching.
