0:00:30	None
 So....

0:00:37	SPEAKER_02
 Bock's coming.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_02
 2019 o'clock, Okay now.

0:00:56	None
 Okay.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_01
 Hey everybody, welcome to the detailed design meeting.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_01
 Let's see, our agenda.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_01
 Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_01
 And I think it looks like we've come up with some ideas.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_01
 And we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_01
 So, for later in the meeting I've done a spreadsheet of production costs.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll take a look at that and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_01
 So, actually, yeah.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_01
 You guys want to give a prototype presentation?

0:02:09	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, well, so our design looks something like this.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_02
 This being the wheel that you use to change channels or volume or whatever.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_02
 So, the button serves as the power button if you hold it down and you just tap on it.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_02
 I think it brings up the menu.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_02
 And the base of the remote control, which has a squishy sponge you'd ever feel, is interchangeable.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_02
 So, you can change the color according to, you know, the suit your living room or whatever.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_02
 I can change the vegetable.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I can change the vegetable.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_01
 It was that broccoli.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, broccoli.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_02
 So, this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_02
 This is not to scale because it would have the battery inside it.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_02
 It's a mango.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_02
 It's trendy fruit.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_02
 It's not just ordinary fruits.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_02
 You don't have orange.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_02
 You have mango.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_02
 I guess strawberries, not just trans-eat.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_02
 Very bright strawberry.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_02
 So, we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_02
 And the people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them because they'll need to switch them up.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_02
 It's been a little bit difficult to make sure that it's hand-holdable and that the user can use it.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_02
 You know, it's not too big.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_02
 But we think that this size will be okay.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_02
 And we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_02
 And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was design yet, actually, would be the thing, the locator.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_02
 So, the locator is just chip it inside there.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. So, that's just...

0:03:47	SPEAKER_02
 The beeper is also inside there too, somewhere.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_02
 So, you have to have a button on your...

0:03:51	SPEAKER_02
 You have to attach the button to the...

0:03:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we didn't design that.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we have that...

0:03:55	SPEAKER_02
 But it would be coordinating with that.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_02
 Hit that...

0:04:00	SPEAKER_02
 You know, match the handset.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_02
 Get up the broccoli.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_02
 Mango.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_02
 Ta-da.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_01
 If you want to look in your project documents folder, there's a Excel spreadsheet.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_01
 The only one that's in there, production costs.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_01
 And if you open it up, I've just stuck the numbers in.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_01
 There's a real challenge there.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_01
 But if I missed anything that we've gone over, or if you see something in that, it has changed.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, we decided on batteries.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_01
 And the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_01
 I said, Uncurved or flat.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's what you have there.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_01
 For the plastic part would be...

0:04:59	SPEAKER_02
 My impression was that flat meant like one of the square remotes.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_02
 But it's really not very clear.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_02
 Because you've got single curve and double curve.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what that means.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_02
 One side is curved and then the other side is curved.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if we're talking about the area just...

0:05:20	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_01
 I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_01
 So what else?

0:05:29	SPEAKER_01
 There's plastic for that area around the button.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_01
 And then rubber would be the squishy, like saying, right?

0:05:38	SPEAKER_01
 And lots of special colors, actually.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_01
 School wheel.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_01
 Do you see anything that I've missed?

0:05:46	SPEAKER_02
 No, I think that's all right.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_01
 So that would make our total of 11.9, which is...

0:05:54	SPEAKER_01
 And less than 12.5, which means we'd be making more of a profit.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_01
 And if we saw a lot of squishy things...

0:06:02	SPEAKER_01
 Ooh, yeah.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:08	None
 So...

0:06:11	SPEAKER_00
 Hmm.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_01
 What did you work on?

0:06:30	SPEAKER_02
 I've got some evaluation criteria.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_02
 I've got the presentation.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_02
 Silence.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_02
 What happens is we have to decide whether this whole project we've been working on, and actually meet the standards we were set at the start.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_02
 The method is...

0:07:14	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I've analyzed the user requirements and integrated them to the TransFunding Marketing reports and in our company's strategy marketing.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_02
 And the findings were that we needed to look in a certain way, feel in a certain way.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_02
 And this is everything's listed down.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_02
 Looking in a certain way, feel in a certain way.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_02
 It has to be technologically and overtive.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_02
 And it has to be easy to use.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_02
 These are all things we looked at at the start.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_02
 And criteria that have to be met.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_02
 We have to use a table.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_02
 I'll show you that later together to decide whether it meets the standards.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_02
 And we have therefore in total, we have five...

0:08:03	SPEAKER_02
 We have 11 points according to which this should be evaluated.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_02
 And the quite...

0:08:11	SPEAKER_02
 Well, basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_02
 I would like to show you the table we have to use.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_02
 No? This is the table.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_02
 Can you see this here?

0:08:28	SPEAKER_02
 So the questions I've given you...

0:08:31	SPEAKER_02
 Could you write that down?

0:08:32	SPEAKER_02
 True is one and four is seven.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_02
 And we'll just go through each point together.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_02
 I think if each of us gives an opinion, then they can be mixed somehow.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know how it works, exactly.

0:08:52	None
 Yeah.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_00
 I've been told...

0:08:53	SPEAKER_02
 Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own?

0:08:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's in the...

0:08:59	SPEAKER_02
 It's in the project documents.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_02
 Is it meeting three minutes now?

0:09:03	SPEAKER_02
 It's called evaluation criteria.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_02
 And it's...

0:09:10	SPEAKER_02
 Under evaluation.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_01
 The PowerPoint one.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay, cool.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_02
 We found that open.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_02
 So it was...

0:09:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, choose one.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_02
 Choose one and four is seven.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_02
 Do you want us to discuss this together?

0:09:37	SPEAKER_02
 Do you want us to do it, sing?

0:09:39	SPEAKER_01
 We can do it separately and then discuss it.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_01
 If that's what people want to do.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_02
 So it's actually a scale.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_01
 Wait, one is true and...

0:09:56	SPEAKER_01
 So these are the questions we're answering.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_02
 And one is...

0:10:00	SPEAKER_02
 If it's fancy, you put one.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_01
 One, right.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_02
 If it's really unfancy, it's...

0:10:04	SPEAKER_01
 If it's somewhere in between, you put four.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, something.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_02
 Does it feel fancy?

0:11:02	SPEAKER_02
 It feels like a video.

0:11:09	None
 No.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_02
 There should already be questions.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_02
 Should be more.

0:11:35	None
 The black two is easy to insert.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to say yes.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_02
 Very, very true.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_02
 I imagine there's somewhere on the front.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_02
 There's a little case that you still don't know.

0:12:31	None
 I'm going to say yes.

0:12:38	None
 I'm going to say yes.

0:12:45	None
 I'm going to say yes.

0:12:52	None
 I'm going to say yes.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to say yes.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think so.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_02
 Unless you feel you need it.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_02
 So, 1.1, we're just going to circle.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_02
 2.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_02
 1.5 to 13.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_02
 So, 1 was 2 and 7 was false.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_01
 So, we do have about the same thing.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_02
 I was thinking 1 means no points.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_02
 So, starting again, 1.1.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_02
 So, 1.2.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_02
 1.3.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_02
 1.4.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_02
 1.2.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_02
 1.3.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_02
 2.4.3.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_01
 So, 1.3.
