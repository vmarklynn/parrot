0:00:30	None
 Okay.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_02
 My what this.

0:00:40	None
 Sorry.

0:00:42	None
 Yep.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:00:46	None
 Okay.

0:00:48	None
 Is that okay now?

0:00:52	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_01
 Hey everybody.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_01
 Welcome to the detailed design meeting.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_01
 Um, let's see.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to talk about the agenda.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_01
 Last time we discussed the squishy foodiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_01
 Um, and I think looks like we've come up with some ideas.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_01
 Um, and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_01
 Um, so for later in the meeting, I've done a spreadsheet of.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to look at that and see if it's changed at all from what we last discussed it.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_01
 Um, soon.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_01
 Actually, yeah.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_01
 Um, you guys want to give a prototype presentation?

0:02:08	None
 Okay.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_02
 Well, um, so our design looks something like this.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_02
 This being the wheel that you use to change channels or volume or whatever.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_02
 There's a button serves as the power button.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_02
 If you hold it down and just tap on it, I think it brings up the menu.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_02
 And the base of the remote control, which has a squishy, spun, you grab what you feel is interchangeable.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_02
 So you can change the color according to, you know, the suit, your living room or whatever.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_02
 I can change the vegetable.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_02
 So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_02
 This is not to scale because it would have the battery inside it.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_02
 This is a mango.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_02
 It's trendy fruit.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's not just ordinary fruits.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_02
 You don't have orange.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_02
 You have mango.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_02
 Um, I guess strawberries, not just tran very bright strawberry.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_02
 It's been a little bit difficult to make sure that it's hand holdable and that the user can use it.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_02
 You know, it's not too big, but we think that this size will be okay.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_02
 And we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_02
 And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was the battery.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_02
 It would be the thing, the locator.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_02
 So locator is just chiplets inside there.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_02
 So that's just the beepers also inside there too.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_02
 So you have to have a button on your, on your, you have to attach the button to the.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we didn't design that.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we have that, that is, yes.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_02
 But it would be coordinating with that.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_02
 Like, hey, that, that, you know, match the handset.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_02
 Get out the broccoli.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_02
 There you go.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_02
 Ta-da.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_01
 Um, if you want to look in your project documents folder, there's an Excel spreadsheet.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_01
 The only one that's in there, production costs.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_01
 And if you open it up, I've just stuck the numbers in.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_01
 It's a real challenge there.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_01
 But if I missed anything that we've gone over, or if you see something that has changed, I mean, we decided on batteries and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_01
 Um, I said, uncurve your flat.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's what you have there.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_01
 Is that right?

0:04:57	SPEAKER_01
 For the, for the plastic part would be.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_02
 My impression was that flat meant like, like one of those square remotes.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_02
 But it's really not very clear because you got single curve and double curve and.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know what that means.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_02
 One side is curved and then the other side is curved.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if we're talking about the area, just.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_01
 I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_01
 Um, so what else?

0:05:29	SPEAKER_01
 There's plastic for that area around the button.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_01
 Um, and then rubber would be the squishy, like, thing, right?

0:05:38	SPEAKER_01
 Um, and lots of special colors, actually.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_01
 Uh, school real.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_01
 Do you see anything that I've missed?

0:05:47	SPEAKER_02
 No, I think that's all right.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so that would make our total of 11.9, which is less than 12.5, which means we have to make you more of a profit.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_01
 And if we saw a lot of squishy things.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_01
 Um, okay.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_00
 So.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_00
 Um,

0:06:28	SPEAKER_01
 what did you work on?

0:06:30	SPEAKER_02
 Um, evaluation, quite.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_02
 I've got the presentation. Okay.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_02
 What happens is we have to, um, decide whether this, this whole, this whole project we've been working on actually, um, meets the standards we were set at the start.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_02
 Um, Okay.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_02
 Um, the method is we, well, I've analyzed the user requirements and integrated them to the trans found in marketing reports and in our company's strategy marketing.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_02
 And, um, the findings were that we needed to look in a certain way, feel in a certain way, and this is everything's listed down.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_02
 Um, looking at certain way, feeling a certain way, it has to be technologically innovative.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_02
 And it has to be easy to use. These are all things we looked at at the start.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_02
 Um, and criteria that have to be met. We have to use a table. I'll show you that later together to decide whether it meets the standards.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_02
 And we, we have therefore in total, um, we have five.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_02
 We have 11 points according to which this should be evaluated.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_02
 And, um, the quite, well, basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_02
 I would like to show you the table we have to use.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_02
 Um, Nope.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_02
 This is the table. Can you see this here?

0:08:27	SPEAKER_02
 Um, so the questions I've given you, could you write that down?

0:08:32	SPEAKER_02
 Um, Santa is one and, and forces seven.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_02
 And we'll just go through each point together, hopefully.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_02
 Um, I think if each of us gives an opinion, then they can be mixed somehow. I don't know how it works exactly.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_02
 I'm really told.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_02
 Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own?

0:08:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's in the, um, it's in the project documents. Is it meeting three minutes? No, it's, it's called evaluation criteria.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_02
 And it's under evaluation.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_01
 The PowerPoint one. Yeah. Okay.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_02
 So it was, um, yeah, choose one.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_02
 Choose one and forces seven. Do you want us to discuss this together? Do you want us to do it soon, do you?

0:09:39	SPEAKER_01
 Um, we can do it separately and then discuss it.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_01
 If that's what people want to do.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_02
 So it's actually a scale. Right. One is true. And, um, so these are the questions we're answering. Yes. And one is, if it's fancy, you put one, right? If it's really unfancy.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_01
 I've said somewhere in between you put four. Okay.

0:10:22	None
 Okay.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_02
 Does it feel fancy?

0:11:08	SPEAKER_02
 There's already big questions.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_02
 So it's easy to insult. I'm going to say yes. Yes. Very, very true.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_02
 I imagine there's somewhere on the front, we have a little case that you slip them in. Go.

0:12:28	None
 Okay.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_01
 Do we, um, is it necessary? I don't think so. It's just the marker. I kind of stopped working.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_01
 Unless you feel you need it.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_02
 Right. Right. So 1.1. We're just going to circle one. Five. Oh, I don't know. Right. One. Five. Five. Five. Two. Okay. So do we just start it up and divide it by four? Is that the company?

0:13:54	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should. It's four if you want to do that. Yeah. Yeah. That's the 16. That's four. Oh, no, that's the 13. 1552. Oh, I thought she said five. 1552 13 over four for now.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_02
 So do we have the next three? Six. Six? Six.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_02
 It wasn't cheating. Right. 1.3. Is.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry. Wait. So one was true and seven was false.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. Okay.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_01
 So we do have them about the same thing.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_01
 We just have it in the free.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_01
 I was thinking one means no points.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_00
 Full of self.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_02
 I should have cut the table up.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, gosh.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_00
 OK.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_00
 Well, first of all, it's no problem.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:53	None
 All right.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I'm glad this came out.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_02
 I was like, why did you guys design it that way?

0:14:58	SPEAKER_00
 I thought you guys hated it.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_02
 It's quite funny.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_02
 So, sorting again 1.1.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_02
 So 2.3.

0:15:36	None
 OK.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_02
 1.2.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_02
 3.2.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_02
 2.2.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_02
 1.3.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_01
 1.1.1.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_02
 2.1.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_02
 2.2. 2.2.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_01
 I think I missed 2.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_01
 Wait, is that 2.1?

0:16:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I put it down to 0.4.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_02
 1.4. 1.5.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_01
 OK, right.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_01
 That's I have to.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_01
 I can use all kinds of problems.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_02
 1.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry about that.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_02
 2.2, which is 1.5.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_01
 1.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_02
 3.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 Wait, wait, wait, wait.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_02
 I put 3.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_02
 1.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_02
 Then 1 on my 2.3.1.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_02
 Is that correct on my slide?

0:16:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_02
 1.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_02
 3.1.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_02
 I have 4.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_02
 3.1.4.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.3.1.3.3.1.3.1.3.1.3.1.3.1.1.2.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_02
 2.4.1.2.1.2.1.2.4.3.4.2.4.3.4.2.4.2.1.2.1.2.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_02
 Right, so I put 1 on that.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, I'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_02
 Or is it tedious? I'm sorry this was so tedious.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, that's...

0:17:26	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should look at the ones that, like, where people set four, where it looks like we might want to discuss changing an aspect of the remote.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_02
 Well, the worst ones were 3.1. Does everyone have a slide? 3.1?

0:17:48	SPEAKER_01
 That was material.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_02
 Slide show.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_02
 Material, technologically innovative.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_02
 Do you want to change it? What's the suggestion?

0:18:03	SPEAKER_02
 Which one is that again, sorry? 3.1?

0:18:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's 3.1 was not that good. 4.1.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_01
 Does the shape?

0:18:14	SPEAKER_02
 Shape. I think 4.2.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_01
 See, I'm having trouble imagining that it's going to be the size, like the controller.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_01
 Or bigger.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_02
 What if we just smashed all the vegetables down flat?

0:18:31	SPEAKER_02
 And, like, then you could hold it in your hand better.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_02
 I think the base would definitely be larger, because some of these are not as easy to hold.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_02
 Kind of smallish.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_01
 No, but I imagine even if it was bigger, like, if it's round and it's big, then you can't get...

0:18:45	SPEAKER_01
 That's why remote controls are not long, because you have that thumb kind of...

0:18:49	SPEAKER_01
 So they could all be bananas in cucumbers.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't...

0:18:55	SPEAKER_01
 I personally don't think this is comfortable to sit there.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_02
 But, like, if you just squashed them flat, like, you made it flat.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_02
 If they're that stress ball stuff, they would be pretty squishable.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_02
 But it's still too big, I think.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_01
 And would it even resemble fruit that way?

0:19:18	SPEAKER_01
 I mean...

0:19:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_02
 Like, you could probably do a strawberry still.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_02
 I think the broccoli would be out.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_02
 You could do a little bit of that. Although the broccoli is quite comfortable, I have to say.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but when you were holding that before, it actually looked...

0:19:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I looked really good.

0:19:37	None
 Yeah, so...

0:19:38	SPEAKER_02
 And then you thought it looked like broccoli, no?

0:19:41	SPEAKER_02
 Eh...

0:19:42	SPEAKER_02
 I thought I could think of rhubarb.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_02
 Rhubarb.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's a mistake.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_02
 I think broccoli is my favourite, actually.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_02
 It's quite fair.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_01
 I think we need...

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 So, it was just patterns on...

0:19:58	SPEAKER_01
 Like, we chose the shape, or the shape could be whatever we wanted, and then it would just be like a design on the rubber.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 Huh?

0:20:09	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, okay.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_01
 Like, just the printed.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_01
 So, just colour it, not just the shape of it.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that could work.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that could work.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_02
 Or...

0:20:16	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, we could even have fruit, like, around...

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_01
 I mean...

0:20:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_01
 But if we need...

0:20:24	SPEAKER_01
 If we need...

0:20:25	SPEAKER_01
 If we want to incorporate the fruit thing somehow, there might be...

0:20:31	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, if it conflicts with the comfort of actually holding me.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, because no one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable, obviously.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_02
 Like, I don't know, some of them you can kind of think...

0:20:44	SPEAKER_02
 See is like...

0:20:46	SPEAKER_02
 Like, you could...

0:20:48	SPEAKER_02
 If it was only this, you know, if it was shaped like that, and it just had that, but the problem is you have to attach it.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_02
 And this has to be detachable.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_02
 So, like, maybe that's just too big because...

0:20:58	SPEAKER_01
 Well, some of it...

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 The reason the broccoli works is you can kind of hold it like that.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's kind of...

0:21:03	SPEAKER_01
 Joystick.

0:21:04	None
 Yeah.

0:21:05	None
 But...

0:21:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, is there some way we could make it this kind of shape?

0:21:12	SPEAKER_01
 Because like...

0:21:13	SPEAKER_02
 We could make it that shape, but just have different colours.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_01
 And like, even with a shape, because we were having fun with that.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_01
 And like...

0:21:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, like you said like a joystick like that, you know?

0:21:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_02
 Like, we could do...

0:21:28	SPEAKER_02
 I'm trying to think of other shapes, like fruits that are...

0:21:31	SPEAKER_01
 Just that, I think.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, that fits the whole round iPod idea.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_01
 And you still have the comfort of holding it like that.

0:21:41	None
 Mm.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_01
 And you could...

0:21:44	SPEAKER_01
 Like, if it's like this, you could put fruit designs and stuff on...

0:21:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_01
 But yeah.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_01
 Alright.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_01
 But I mean, to really have any other ideas about that?

0:21:57	SPEAKER_00
 Um...

0:22:02	SPEAKER_00
 We could...

0:22:03	None
 Shh.

0:22:04	None
 Yeah.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_02
 The critical ones came out to be...

0:22:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that one...

0:22:13	SPEAKER_02
 The...

0:22:14	SPEAKER_02
 Bats are easier to then suck, somewhere easy.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_02
 Which could be easily...

0:22:22	SPEAKER_02
 They're not fun to problem them.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_02
 The better is they're going...

0:22:24	SPEAKER_02
 I thought everyone gave that a one or two.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_02
 In the back?

0:22:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, they'd probably be either on the front or the side.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_02
 The reason I didn't give it a one...

0:22:30	SPEAKER_01
 I think I gave it a three, because I thought you'd have to like unclip.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_01
 No, you'd...

0:22:36	SPEAKER_02
 I imagine there'd be sort of a...

0:22:37	SPEAKER_02
 Catch...

0:22:38	SPEAKER_01
 Just like any other one.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_02
 I don't want the normal enough.

0:22:40	None
 Alright.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_02
 So it'd probably be either...

0:22:42	SPEAKER_02
 No, it can't be in the front.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_02
 Because the IRR is right there, but it'd be on one of the sides, probably.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_02
 I think everyone's in the end of three, anyway.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_02
 So I think it's...

0:22:53	SPEAKER_02
 That's the end of two points.

0:22:56	None
 Cool.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_02
 Well...

0:23:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the broccoli...

0:23:02	SPEAKER_02
 I guess, when this...

0:23:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I'd agree with changing the shape.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_02
 Why would you just having fun making strawberries and stuff?

0:23:09	SPEAKER_02
 We were a bit off task.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:23:13	SPEAKER_02
 I can't think of any...

0:23:17	SPEAKER_02
 So we'll have to like...

0:23:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_02
 You could make the touchpad in different shapes, but then that kind of redesigns the whole project.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_02
 But you could do...

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 Like, some sort of annoying people who get used to having the buttons.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's a shame.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_01
 And it would probably cost more to produce.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's just that irregular.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_02
 How about having different colors and what you've been having different shapes too?

0:23:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_01
 Which is why printing might be, like, just printing the...

0:23:54	SPEAKER_01
...through...

0:23:55	SPEAKER_01
...on.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we've done finance evaluation criteria.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_01
 Production evaluation.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_01
 So project evaluation.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_02
 You want this and it can...

0:24:33	SPEAKER_01
 I guess we're supposed to discuss the process of the project and how satisfied.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, it's alright.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_01
 That's a lot.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_01
 Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity?

0:24:51	SPEAKER_01
 Sort of.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_01
 I did.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, fruit and squishiness are more creative.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_01
 Bunchiness.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_02
 The prototype making was very creatively stimulating.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_02
 And I think we've come up with a product that's fun.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_02
 And it's all the criteria.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_01
 And how is our leadership and teamwork?

0:25:18	SPEAKER_02
 I think it was good.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_02
 We knew what we were doing.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_02
 It was a very democratic process.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_02
 Everyone got to contribute.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I thought my leadership was crap personally.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_01
 He told us when to start and end and that's all the tips.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_01
 I think you were fine.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_02
 I'm just going to jump.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_01
 I'm never going to do a management position.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_01
 I know that now.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I thought we all worked very well together.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_02
 It all sort of blended.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think it more than anything.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_02
 We didn't really have our set role so much as we just would be like, you know, all had ideas.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_02
 Very democratic.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_01
 No spats.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_01
 That was good.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_01
 And the means for like the materials we used, how convenient were they?

0:26:04	SPEAKER_01
 Like the pens, the whiteboard.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, well, I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft PowerPoint or any Mac person.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, I never touch Macs either.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_02
 I just use the Unix or the off market sort of word perfect and all these other things.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_02
 Which is a lot of you need to be able to.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_02
 Well, the problem is if you don't like my new computer never has word perfect.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_02
 So I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_02
 So I have all these documents.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_02
 I can't use them.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah, I mean, I guess it's okay.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if it was just my role, but I thought that the information that was available to me was kind of just like, or maybe it was just the idea that we had, but there's kind of, it was kind of like, okay, I don't really think, I don't know what I'm doing here.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_02
 So I didn't really think it was helpful.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_02
 So I kind of just made up my own stuff.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_02
 And I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_02
 So I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah, I don't really like PowerPoint, personally.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_02
 It's kind of stupid.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_02
 I never use it.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but I can't say I found everything particularly helpful.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I didn't really.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_02
 I first bit of information was like, the child's drawn.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, how it would work.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_02
 Mine was really helpful.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_01
 My problem was you guys had access to, like, they'd send you to sites and stuff, right?

0:27:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_01
 So I didn't really know what you guys were doing.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_01
 And when you were talking about it, it's just like, that's why it seems so ignorant when you're explaining things.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, mine was mostly made up, except when they told me, like, you know, titanium costs more than it would to make a remote control.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_02
 But it must have been quite difficult for them to build the whole system.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_02
 The whole system, because of course they can't give you anything comparable to the internet.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I mean, I think it's interesting how it all went together.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_02
 Like, I had the stuff about how rubber is cheap and you have how people want it to be spongy.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_02
 It seems planned.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I kind of thought that I felt like I would go and, like, try to use my information.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_02
 Or, like, I'd make this stupid little presentation and then, like, I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated because I felt like I was off task all the time.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_02
 But, um...

0:28:30	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I mean, we really got into talking about, like, personal practicality.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_01
 Like, it wasn't necessarily what was, like, we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess, you know?

0:28:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:28:43	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:28:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_02
 And it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, right.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_01
 Given certain information or...

0:28:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, like, if everyone's given the same input, I don't know.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_02
 Um...

0:28:59	SPEAKER_02
 What's next?

0:29:00	SPEAKER_02
 I know that's not...

0:29:02	SPEAKER_02
 Um...

0:29:03	SPEAKER_01
 What did you guys think of the pens that asked about?

0:29:06	SPEAKER_01
 It's pretty cool.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_02
 I want to start to write with them.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_01
 And I...

0:29:12	SPEAKER_01
 I forgot one to try to check the box.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_02
 I'd like to see what it looks like.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, wow.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_02
 They're nicer than the pen that I'm using.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_02
 Because, like, your stuff actually shows up here rather than having to look at the screen and write.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_00
 Mm-hmm.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_02
 That even so, how did I...

0:29:31	SPEAKER_01
 And...

0:29:34	SPEAKER_01
 New ideas found?

0:29:36	SPEAKER_02
 That's all very new.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think I'd like to...

0:29:48	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_02
 Like, it was that I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down, but, like, they're kind of clumsy.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_02
 I guess I'm just going up to the light, probably.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I drop off if you like moved too much.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I don't know, but there.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we are.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_02
 I think, and I think that, uh...

0:30:11	SPEAKER_02
 All this technology, like, I guess some people must be interested in using it, but I can't imagine finding it any more useful than, like, looking at someone's notes.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_02
 Or, like, I actually worked in a company and I had a role and I had to go to meetings.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_02
 And, like, the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video because I missed a meeting.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_02
 Like, usually I miss meetings deliberately.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_02
 There's just...

0:30:33	SPEAKER_02
 There's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_02
 Like, when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_02
 Especially, like, rehashing old stuff.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_02
 And just sort of going over general stuff that anybody who sort of wants tasks should already know.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_02
 It's like, there's just really not a lot of information.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_02
 It's kind of, like, an excessive iteration.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_01
 It seems like way overkill.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_02
 Like, if I missed a meeting, I could probably get it summed up in, like, one sentence.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_02
 I wouldn't need to have to watch, like, a two-hour video with a sound and a transcript.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_02
 I guess it would be...

0:31:02	SPEAKER_02
 It's got to be worth it.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_02
 I guess I'm just mostly curious about, like, what kind of person or, like, company would really find it useful?

0:31:12	SPEAKER_02
 Can't really imagine.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_02
 How about a...

0:31:18	SPEAKER_02
 A pita?

0:31:19	SPEAKER_02
 Er...

0:31:23	SPEAKER_00
 Er...

0:31:28	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's anyone want to talk about fruit more while we still have time?

0:31:32	SPEAKER_01
 When are you other ideas?

0:31:35	SPEAKER_02
 Well, what we... we supposed to... we supposed to watch report.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_02
 We end there.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_02
 Erm...

0:31:43	SPEAKER_01
 We still have time to face any other input.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I think we did really well, personally, which is why we've, you know, gone through this so quickly.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_01
 Because, I mean, we've all, we all kind of agree that our product is satisfactory.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_01
 It fits the budget, and it's trendy.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_01
 It's amazing.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:32:11	SPEAKER_01
 Erm...

0:32:12	SPEAKER_02
 I'm with my dad.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_01
 So I think that's all for today.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_02
 We'll have to put in all this stuff.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_02
 Meeting adjourned.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_02
 Meeting adjourned.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_02
 I think I've learned not to bring, play, note to meetings.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_02
 I think it would be a good idea.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_02
 I like it.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_02
 I'm probably not enough to get people actually paying attention, especially if you have food.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_01
 So I guess we're supposed to write final reports.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_01
 All of this?

0:32:49	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_02
 Well, as well, I have nine...

0:32:52	SPEAKER_00
 Mmm...

0:32:55	SPEAKER_01
 Is that just me?
