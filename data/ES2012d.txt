0:00:00	SPEAKER_00
 Welcome to the, should be the last of these meetings and it looks like we've done a good job here and we'll just go through the final details.

0:00:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, all the minutes are last meeting and we'll take those as red.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, the next thing we'll have a look at the prototype and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then just tidy up with production and then we can close.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_00
 So if you'd like to present your proposals.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, we basically have the same kind of layout here, it's just you hold it like this and it gets kind of molded to the shape of your hand basically.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_03
 On the left we've got the scroll for the volume on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kind of so you can hold it and scroll, you can hold it and push.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_03
 This is the power key, it's kind of like the biggest you know how to turn it on.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_03
 That's the little menu key.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_03
 This is the infrared section so you can, it'll be sending rays and if you're you know pointing it like that you can send it or if you hold it up like that it will send it.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_03
 We've got a microphone there which for all the voice commands you can you know talk to it like that and it will still send.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_03
 The logo is down there and hers has the cover on it and you can see like it just kind of goes, the red bits, the current kind of goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_02
 And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic just kind of a light non-descript gray so the people want to buy the covers and then the coverage would be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers so they kind of just struct over.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_00
 Show me age of it and then we'll like.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I'll try.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah, they're kind of, it's just kind of a rubbery and that way you know spongy like is something that people wanted and it just sort of stretches over and that way I think probably helps protect a little bit too as well.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_03
 But it's also easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kind of sometimes would get someone to do that for you.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_03
 This is very much easier to stretch over to yourself and it'll be fine.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, good.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_02
 And then the buttons come through and so and then each one of them on the very end will have the logo with a yellow circle on the right.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_03
 And that'll be the covers as well.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_00
 I mean it's a detail point.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_00
 I just want to, I mean, how will people put these down?

0:02:57	SPEAKER_00
 I wonder.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_00
 I decided to just put some strange in the reason I did my mind and they put them down vertically.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_03
 And we could broaden the, broaden it out a bit so it would stand.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_00
 You know, because if it's a particular thing, if they're going to have it as a, there was a fashion item.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, standing.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it's just, I mean, it's just a minor detail point.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_00
 As you say, it's made the base a little bit bigger.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we just widened out.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_00
 And they just need another, another logo somewhere.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_00
 It's all, it just gives people the option and if they've got them, it's basically going to be like, what's the difference?

0:03:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I mean, yeah.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_00
 That's, but that's, but no, the overall, the overall, yeah.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no, no.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_00
 So it's just like, we're right.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_00
 You have to lengthen it so it kind of, your hands still hold it.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_00
 That's a natural kind of idea.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_01
 Or it's like, yeah.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_01
 Or kind of, like, maybe slightly thinner, yeah, that kind of moves more like, like a, like a floor or a plant.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_02
 But, so would be balanced.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it's a final product would actually stand up.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_00
 But, yeah.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_00
 These were all minor, minor, minor details.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_00
 I think the basic concept is absolutely bang on.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_00
 And it certainly meets our criteria of being, you know, looking different.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_00
 So good.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_00
 That's excellent.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_00
 Let us, what's on the next one?

0:04:36	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, right.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_00
 Let's have a look at the, the fine ends.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_00
 Now, we're giving a clear design brief.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_00
 If I don't get the spreadsheet up.

0:05:05	None
 Yeah, yeah.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_01
 Just click there.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_01
 Just click there.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, the maximates one.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, right.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_01
 Good.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_00
 This is why we need to make these things simple.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_00
 So, yeah.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_00
 The boss can understand.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_00
 Now, I've, this is a company's costing for various aspects of design.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_00
 And I've treated some of these slightly liberally given the constraints placed on us.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_00
 I've never, for instance, if they require us to have it in the corporate colours, then that is not a special colour.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_00
 That's a standard colour.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_00
 So, we're just simply on batteries.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_00
 The one, the one decision I've had to make is that we, we will have to find a regular standard chip to do this with.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_00
 And I, I, I'm certain that they, they are around.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_00
 So, that, I don't think is a serious problem.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_00
 The, the voice sensor is, is expensive, but we made a basic decision that I was absolutely fundamental to the design.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_00
 So, that, that has to stay.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_00
 And again, the, the, the shape of the case means that it's expensive to, to make, because the, the, the double curves, but on the other hand, because of our overall fashion concept, we, we should exceed the, the sales targets.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_00
 It's simply made of plastic, so that's, that's no problem.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_00
 And just because the whole, you know, they're the colour of the, the whole thing.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_00
 That's, there's some cost there.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_00
 And, where I'm actually going to scroll wheel, we've, we've got push buttons and, and the simple, and, and, and, and, and the, and, and, and the buttons are.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I don't know the special colour.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway, the, the costings are coming at exactly on target at 12.5.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_00
 But I think we have a, a very strong case to argue that's, what, what we've got is, is so, and, and, and, and difference that's, um, any, any slight compromise we have to make on, on cost, is offset by the, you know, the, you know, the concept of it being a, a fashion accessory and having to be interchangeable, covers, so, you know, the, if, if, if, if, the management expectors to be technically, I'm going to say that, yeah, again, that's sort of, well, fairly again, technologically innovative, that they, they have to accept that we, we can't operate absolutely within the constraints that they give.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_00
 So, we, we present this as the, the companies, the companies way forward.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_00
 And, I think we can argue that we, we have, coming on, on budget.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_00
 Uh, so, um, does anybody want to, uh, Andrew, what, what do you want to say about, um, the evaluation, the evaluation, where, where, where, where, where, where, where we're at?

0:08:53	SPEAKER_01
 The, the, the product, or the project.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_01
 The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the product.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_00
 Um, well, well, my presentation just now.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:09:09	None
 Can I get there?

0:09:10	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, sorry.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_00
 More of a clicks in the long run.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_01
 There we go.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_01
 Better evaluation.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_01
 Sounds to solve, from the point that you have the, uh, the consumer and the management.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_01
 So, what I've been asked to do is on the whiteboard, engage.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_01
 Our team response.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_01
 Zoomist questions.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_01
 On a skill 1-7, 1 being true and 7 being false, 7 being a nice round number to work.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_00
 And then at the end it's taking average 1 foot, true and 7 foot for Flays.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_01
 So look at these questions.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_01
 Is the device flashy and fashionable?

0:10:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, definitely a 1.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_01
 So also a technological innovative?

0:10:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, the voice technology indeed.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_00
 Easy tease.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_00
 Well, sometimes they may be made it any easier.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_01
 Suitable for the consumer.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_01
 How does that mean totally?

0:11:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think it made me mad all of the consumer.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_02
 And ones.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_01
 Is it complicated?

0:11:18	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_01
 Do you have a pretty fast overcome?

0:11:23	SPEAKER_01
 Functional?

0:11:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, definitely.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I can be with family easily.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I'm built in the speech class.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_00
 Where are you?

0:11:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_00
 Take long to learn to use, shouldn't?

0:11:47	SPEAKER_01
 And what was the RSI compared to the current standards?

0:11:52	SPEAKER_01
 Less buttons, sorry, but it was a made it actually.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_03
 It is.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_03
 The handle more economically correct as well.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the device is built at all age groups.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_00
 I think it will, because older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the voice.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we had the data at the start saying that older people will be less likely to pay extra money, but the increased functionality, the ease of use of the device, make me comfortable.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think we're actually charging a particular premium anyway in the end.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_03
 We will tend to appeal more to younger age groups, because we have gone with the fashion focus and the older people tend to be more conscious of that aspect of it.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_03
 But I think it's still appeal on a certain level.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_00
 For different reasons.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think it's just simplicity.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_00
 So I, yeah.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_02
 Not having to learn to program and not having a million buzz.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_00
 I think we can reason we say it's another one.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_00
 Why not?

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 Can you just click my mouse button to move on to the next page?

0:13:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_01
 And what?

0:13:03	SPEAKER_00
 It did we meet the main?

0:13:05	SPEAKER_00
 In my interpretation of management instructions is, yes, it meets requirements.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_00
 It's television only.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_00
 It's simple to use.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_00
 It's within budget.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_00
 It's, yes, and any minor points we argue.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_00
 So I think we've done an amazing job in this.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_00
 Well done, ask.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_01
 Come here with a flop.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_01
 So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 Eleven divided by eleven is one.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_01
 Of course, average of one.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_00
 We need to calculate it for that.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_01
 And that roughly concludes my other interpretation of the...

0:14:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_00
 The product.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_00
 The table.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_00
 That's it.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_00
 Do either of you want to say anything?

0:14:19	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think so.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, we worked well together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we're trying to make.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_02
 And, you know, seemed to discuss things pretty well and come to a group consensus.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that's right.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, this slide here, I mean, the satisfaction with the room for creativity.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, I think we've allowed ourselves as much creativity as the product allows.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_00
 I'm coming on leadership teamwork.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_00
 I think we've, I think everybody's worked pretty well together.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_00
 We've just met code with a white board and digital pens.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_00
 I think the results speak for itself.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_00
 And the new ideas found, again, you know, given relatively everyday product.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_00
 I think we've very, very effectively come up with a new approach.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_00
 Of course, within budget, yes, is a project evaluated.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_00
 We're all happy that it meets all the criteria.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you very much indeed.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's, I think we can go for an early bath.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_00
 So why call the meeting closed?

0:15:43	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_00
 Not sure how far ahead of schedule will go over.
