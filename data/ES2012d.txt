0:00:00	SPEAKER_00
 Alright, well, welcome to the, it should be the last of these meetings and it looks like we've done a good job here and we'll just go through the final details.

0:00:23	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, all the minutes of last meeting, we'll take those as red.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, the next thing we'll have a look at the prototypes and the evaluation criteria in finance and then just tidy up with production and then we can close.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_00
 So if you'd like to present your proposals.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, we basically have the same kind of layout here, it's just, you hold it like this and it's kind of molded to the shape of your hand basically.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_03
 On the left we've got the scroll for the volume on the right.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_03
 We have buttons for the channels up and down and that kind of so you can hold it and scroll, you can hold it and push.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_03
 This is the power key, it's kind of like the biggest you know how to turn it on.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_03
 That's the little menu key.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_03
 This is the infrared section so it'll be sending rays and if you're pointing it like that, you can send it or if you hold it up like that it'll send it.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_03
 We've got a microphone there which for all the voice commands, you can talk to it like that and it'll still send.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_03
 The logo is down there and Hertz has the cover on it and you can see it just kind of goes, the red bits, the cover that kind of goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_02
 And so we figured it would be kind of a light brick plastic, just kind of a light non-descript grey so the people would want to buy the covers and then the covers would be that sort of very material like they make iPod covers so they kind of just stretch over.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_00
 Show me age I don't know what I'm talking about.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I know.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah it's just kind of a rubbery and that way you know spongy like is something that people wanted and it just sort of stretches over and that way I think probably helps protect a little bit too as well.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_03
 But it's also easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kind of sometimes would get someone to do that for you.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, good.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_02
 Stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then each one of them on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle on the right.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_03
 And that'll be the covers as well.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_00
 I mean it's a detailed point.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_00
 I just want to, I mean how will people put these down?

0:02:58	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, I decided to put some strange in my mind that they put them down vertically.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_03
 We could broaden it out a bit so it would stand.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_00
 No, because if they're going to have it as a fashion item.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I mean it's just a minor detail point.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_00
 As you say, it's made the base a little bit bigger.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we just wind it out.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_00
 And it just needs another logo somewhere.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_00
 It's all, excuse people, the option and if they've got them.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_00
 That's because we might actually have several lines upon the, yeah.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_00
 We just lengthened I guess.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_00
 But that's, but no, the overall concept is.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_00
 Somewhere like that.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, I mean, they're so...

0:03:53	SPEAKER_03
 I have to lengthen it so it kind of, your hands don't have any idea.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe slightly thinner.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that kind of works more like a, like a floor, or a plant.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but the, yeah, the...

0:04:07	SPEAKER_02
 So it would be balanced.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I mean, it would be so...

0:04:11	SPEAKER_00
 The final product would actually stand up.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_00
 But the, these were minor, minor details.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_00
 I think the basic concept is absolutely bang on.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_00
 It certainly meets our criteria of being, you know, looking different.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_00
 So good.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_00
 That's excellent.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_00
 Let's just...

0:04:32	SPEAKER_00
 What's on the next one?

0:04:37	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, right.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_00
 Let's have a look at the finance.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_00
 We're giving it a clear design brief.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_00
 Try not to get the spreadsheet up.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_00
 Nope.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_01
 Just click there.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_01
 There, there, maximates.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, right.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_00
 Oh.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_00
 Good.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_00
 This is why we need to make these things simple.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_00
 So the Voskin understand.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_00
 Now, I've, this is a company's costing for various aspects of design.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_00
 And I've treated some of these slightly liberally, given the constraints placed on us.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_00
 For instance, if they require us to have it in the corporate colors, then there's not a special color.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_00
 That's a standard color.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_00
 So we're just simply on batteries.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_00
 The one decision I've had to make is that we will have to find a regular standard chip to do this with.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_00
 And I'm certain that they are around.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_00
 So I don't think it's a serious problem.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_00
 The voice sensor is expensive, but we made a basic decision that was absolutely fundamental to the design.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_00
 So that has to stay.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_00
 And again, the shape of the case means that it's expensive to make it a little bit more expensive.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_00
 To make because of the double curves.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_00
 But on the other hand, because of our overall fashion concept, we should exceed the sales targets.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_00
 It's simply made a plastic.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_00
 So that's no problem.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_00
 And just because the whole thing, the color of the whole thing, that's some cost there.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_00
 And we haven't actually got a scroll wheel.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_00
 We've got push buttons and the simple slider.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_00
 So the buttons are...

0:07:25	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know the special color.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway, the costumes are coming exactly on target at 12.5.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_00
 I think we have a very strong case to argue that what we've got is so innovative and different.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_00
 That any slight compromise we have to make on cost is offset by the concept of it being a fashion accessory and having the interchangeable covers.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_00
 So if the management expectors to be technical, I'm not going to say that yet again.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_00
 It will fail again.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_00
 Technologically innovative.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_00
 They have to accept that we can't operate absolutely within the constraints that they give.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_00
 So we present this as the company's way forward.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_00
 I think we can argue that we have coming on budget.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_00
 So does anybody want to, Andrew, what do you want to say about the evaluation?

0:08:49	SPEAKER_00
 Where we're at?

0:08:54	SPEAKER_01
 The product or the project?

0:08:57	SPEAKER_00
 The product.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_01
 Well, are my presentations just now?

0:09:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_00
 Can I get there?

0:09:05	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, sorry.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_00
 More then clicks in the locker room.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_01
 There we go.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_01
 The better evaluation of the product was to just see if I met all the conditions that we set out.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_01
 So from the point you have the consumer and the management.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_01
 What I've been asked to do is on the whiteboard, engage our team response to these questions.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_01
 On a scale of one being true and seven being false.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_00
 Seven being a nice round number to work.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_01
 And then at the end it's taken average one for two and seven for flays.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_01
 So look at these questions.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_01
 Is the device flashy and fashionable?

0:10:43	SPEAKER_03
 I think much better.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, definitely a one.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_01
 So also a technological innovative?

0:10:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, the voice technology indeed.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_00
 Easy to use.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_00
 I don't see them, but they made it any easier.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_01
 Suitable for the consumer.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_01
 Have the same.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_01
 Totally.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_02
 I think we met all of the consumer.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_01
 Is it complicated?

0:11:18	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_01
 Don't break files so far.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_01
 Functional?

0:11:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, definitely.

0:11:26	None
 I'm.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to be found easily.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_00
 Built in the speech.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_00
 Where are you?

0:11:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_00
 It's not a time for the

0:11:42	SPEAKER_03
 user to take long to learn to use, shouldn't?

0:11:47	SPEAKER_01
 No, no. And there was the RSI compared to the current standards.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_01
 The best buttons, so it must be.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it was a made natural effort.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_03
 It is sort of the handle more economically correct as well.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:01	None
 Oh, yeah.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_01
 What device are built at all age groups?

0:12:07	SPEAKER_00
 Well, because I mean, all the people who can't manage the buttons anyway, we're actually probably

0:12:12	SPEAKER_01
 lightweight, like the voice. But we had the data to start saying that all people will be less likely to pay extra money, but the increased functionality, the ease of use of the device might make up for that.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 It's, it's, well, I don't think we're actually charging a particular premium anyway in the end.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_03
 I think it will tend to appeal more to younger age groups just because we have gone with the fashion focus and the other people tend to, would be more conscious of that aspect of it.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_03
 But I think it still appeal on a certain level to everybody.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_00
 For different reasons.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think the simplicity of it.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_00
 So I, yeah.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_02
 Not having to learn to program and not having.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_00
 So I think we can reasonably say it's another, another one.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_00
 Why not?

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 Can you just click my mouse button to move on to the next page?

0:13:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_01
 And what?

0:13:03	SPEAKER_00
 Do we meet the main, is in my interpretation of management instructions is, yes, it meets requirements.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_00
 It's television only.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_00
 It's simple to use.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_00
 It's just within budget.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_00
 It's, yes, and any minor points we argue.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_00
 So I think we've done an amazing job in that.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_00
 Well done, ask.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_00
 Coming up with the clock.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_01
 So we're at one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_01
 Eleven divided by eleven is one.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_01
 Because average of one, we need to calculate it for that.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_01
 And that roughly concludes my evaluation of the product.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_00
 The product.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_00
 The table.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_00
 That's all.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_00
 Do either of you want to say anything?

0:14:13	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think so.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, we worked well together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we're looking at in the industry, and we can, you know, seem to discuss things very well and come to a group consensus.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that's right.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, this slide here, I mean the satisfaction with the room for creativity.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, I think we've allowed ourselves as much creativity as the product allows.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not coming on leadership team work.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_00
 I think we've, I think everybody's worked pretty well together.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_00
 with the stock code with the whiteboard and digital pens. I think the results speak for itself and the idea is found, again, given relatively everyday product. I think we've very effectively come up with a new approach. Are the costs within budget? Yes, is a project evaluated. We're all happy that it meets all the criteria. Thank you very much indeed.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you. I think we can go for an early path. So I call the meeting closed. Not sure if I had a schedule we were there.
