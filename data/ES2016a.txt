0:00:00	None
 Okay.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, that's not going to work.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, all right.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_03
 As you all know, we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_03
 I'm Nick Tabusk. I'm the project manager.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_03
 We'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing, what your role is.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_03
 Go ahead.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. I'm Corinne Whiting and I will be the marketing expert.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_00
 And in each of the three phases, I will have a different role in the function design phase.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_00
 I will be talking about user requirements specification.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_00
 And this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_00
 And I'll be doing research to figure this out.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_00
 In the conceptual design phase, I will be dealing with trend watching.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_00
 And I'll be doing marketing research on the web.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_00
 And then finally in the detailed design phase, I will be doing product evaluation.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_00
 And so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all of the requirements to see how we did.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_02
 I'm Ryan. I'm the user interface designer. Likewise, I have three different roles for each stage of the design.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_02
 The functional design is looking at the technical functions of remote control.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_02
 In the concept design, the user interface, how the user reacts with the product.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_02
 And in the detailed design, sort of like the user interface design, what they're looking for, things like fashions, what makes it special.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_02
 That's about it. I'm Manuel.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_01
 And I'm the industrial designer in this project.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_01
 In the functional design phase, I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_01
 We'll discuss what the product has to fulfill and so on.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_01
 I suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_01
 In the conceptual design, I'll be mostly dealing with properties and materials of our product.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_01
 And the detailed design and the detailed design, I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_01
 Pretty much working together, obviously, on the design.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. So we've got our opening, our agenda is the opening acquaintance, which we've kind of done.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_03
 Tool training, project plan, discussion, and then closing.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_03
 Granted, 25 minutes we have here.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_03
 So we are putting together a new remote control.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_03
 We want it to be something original.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, we're a not only electronics company, but a fashion conscious electronics company.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_03
 We've got a brand new app called Trendy.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_03
 And we want it to be easy to use.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_03
 We've got the functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_03
 And well, functional design.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_03
 Do we have any ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have?

0:05:19	SPEAKER_03
 And then we can go into how we're going to design it and how we're going to do the detailing on it.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_02
 Well, function remote control is just a change of channels as it's main function.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_03
 So we want it to be a TV remote, or do we want it to do other things besides just be a television remote?

0:05:45	SPEAKER_02
 I suppose try to make it a university remote, but it could work on all sort of electrical products in one person's house.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_02
 But you know, they also have the same role, changing channels, volumes, and then programming.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_02
 I think they all work on the same principles, which I doubt is no.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_03
 It's not.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_03
 I think, yeah, universal remote.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_03
 This is my first go around with creating remote control.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_03
 I think we're all on the same boat here.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_02
 One thing I thought of remote control is you always lose them.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_02
 There's a way of finding that quite easily.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_03
 So we should we should feature set our remote control up to where it has a.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_03
 Like a tracking device or like a whistle or making noise.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_02
 It makes a noise.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_03
 There's a button on the TV that you press.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_01
 So.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_02
 Generally all remote was a sort of quite similar in their pains.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_03
 We want so they're kind of like long and rectangular.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_00
 We want something crazy.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_03
 You know, we want something new that's going to stand out.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_03
 I think modern.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_02
 So our remote should be very close.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe like user friendly like a little.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_02
 People I thought maybe because people always sent a theory about the place to whether it was in a ball and actual controls or inside or something.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_01
 Well, there are of course certain restrictions.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_01
 You can't have it be any form and fulfill all functions at the same time.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_01
 So there are obviously some restrictions we have to apply here.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_01
 However, one question is how stable is that.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_01
 Is that thing supposed to be the first of the material pretty much?

0:08:03	SPEAKER_01
 What are we going to build the thing out of how sturdy is it going to be?

0:08:06	SPEAKER_01
 Do we want it to last longer or rather have people.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so by one.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_03
 So we want to be sturdy.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_03
 We wanted to hold up to somebody's child, you know, throwing it across the room.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_03
 Or as you said, people kind of throw it so ball shaped.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_03
 You know, if it were ball shaped, maybe.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_02
 Can you cast on the outside and everything can be inside.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_03
 Camp.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_03
 So we want it to be modern fun.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_03
 Sturdy.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_03
 So our form and our function.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_03
 We wanted to be easy to find.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_03
 What else.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_03
 What else do we want it to do?

0:09:26	SPEAKER_03
 So we want it to be universal.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_03
 It's something that we're supposed to sell for about 25 euros.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_03
 And.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_03
 So we want to make sure that we have the same goals for profits or I think somewhere around 50 million euros.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_03
 What they want to make on it.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_00
 Also, since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association, maybe we want to make it something that would globally appeal.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_00
 That's more on the research end.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_03
 So marketing, you know, how maybe marketing you could find out what is the most universally appealing remote control out there.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_00
 And maybe as far as design goes, maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_00
 Because maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_02
 And.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_03
 You guys have any ideas for what it should look like.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_03
 We want to be a ball.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_03
 Drop the ball and maybe where the buttons are located.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_02
 My original idea was just simply sort of a sphere where maybe you.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_02
 This is where it's connected together.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_02
 And then when you open it out, it could be a flip, like a flip phone.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_02
 And then when you fold it out of the middle, maybe a hinge.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_02
 That's the strongest part of it.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_02
 Without if you did use a hinge, you're just two parts and then you'd have just like you buttons.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_02
 Things inside, I think sometimes we're not so too many buttons.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_02
 So very simple as possible.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_02
 There's few of those inside as possible.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_02
 And then there was the idea for just something.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe if it had like some kind of light or something or lights around it.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_02
 It's looking a bit like something like Star Wars at the moment.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_02
 To be fair.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_02
 That was just a simple idea.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't know you could feel out about it.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_02
 It would almost be likeable.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_02
 So that was just the idea I had.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if there was other ideas.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_01
 One problem you'd get with this design is the ball is an ice idea because of its stability.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_01
 But of course, since it's about a roll, we'd have to have it flat on the side of the east.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 We'd have to take away that part.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 That's one of the big issues.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_01
 Also you risk the hinges here.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_02
 There is a problem.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_02
 There is a hinge.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_01
 That's interesting of course, but that's of course a weak point.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_03
 How would we go about making, you know, getting rid of our weak points?

0:13:31	SPEAKER_03
 What I mean, but we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_03
 Not to put you on the spot, but what did you say your title was again?

0:13:45	SPEAKER_03
 I'm the industrial designer.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_01
 Industrial designer.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the point is that maybe the shape is perhaps not the most ideal as stable as it is.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_01
 There must be a compromise between the stability design here.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sure I think of the design of others.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_02
 I can't think of anything other than the long rectangle.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_02
 For a small sort of faster ones, but there's nothing being done sort of out of.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_03
 That's not new. It's not innovative.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_03
 Everybody does longer remote because it's easy.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_03
 It's stable.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_00
 I'll do something.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_03
 Go ahead.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_00
 My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape, you know, like video games.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe, I mean, that would be kind of big and bulky.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_00
 We could also try to do the hints then so it could like flip out that way.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_02
 I think definitely doing something different.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, very design something that's sort of like, I suppose not always everybody's hands the same, but something that would be fitting the hand easier.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_02
 Something with a grip.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_03
 Because even I suppose even with the ball, you still might be able to.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_03
 It might not be the easiest to hold on to.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_03
 So perhaps the joystick, the keyboard idea might work better.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_03
 But then again, people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe maybe it's the thing is definitely going to be a one on the job.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_03
 I feel like I'm just shooting everything down here.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_00
 You're the boss.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_01
 The one hand to design yourself in front of the size, because you know, from cell phones, they can be too small.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_01
 It's too small.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_01
 If it's small, it probably looks better, but it may not be as functional.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so fortunately we've got about five minutes here to come up with our remote control idea and start rolling with it.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_03
 We've talked about our experiences with remote control and we've got a couple ideas.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_03
 Let's see here.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_03
 What if we had not only, say we went with the ball, the ball function.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_03
 But maybe we give it sort of grips along the side to make it easier to hold on to.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_03
 So, you know, so it's easier to hold on to that way.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, that'll then remove some of our ball unless this, unless this part were raised.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_03
 So say the cover flips over and covers that part.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_03
 So the grip is no, that wouldn't work either.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_03
 If we're going to make it flat on the bottom, then that eliminates our ball anyways.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_03
 So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sort of grips on the side here, I guess.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_03
 And then we have the problem with the hinge.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_03
 So if we're flat on the bottom, it's not going to roll away. It'll stay where we want.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_01
 The question is also, I don't know.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_01
 Do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it?

0:18:59	SPEAKER_01
 That's true. It's probably going to lie around open all the time anyway.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_01
 So I don't know if a lid is a good idea from stability point of view.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_01
 It certainly is. But also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_01
 Break by accident, the more we sell.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_01
 So, don't make it.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_03
 So we don't have it flip open. We just have a ball.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_02
 But then maybe go about to the thing I want to know those things.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_03
 So then we forget the ball.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_03
 It looks cool, but it's really not functional.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_03
 So we've got our sort of keyboard kind. But if we flipped it around here so that it were.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry, that doesn't look anything like what you had there.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_03
 So it's up and down. You hold it this way.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, then it's like the rectangular again only with a couple of jutting out points.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_03
 But it's one handed.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_01
 Question is what makes those game pads functional?

0:20:19	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's pretty much the form for the hand.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_01
 So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_01
 Mix it nice. So that's the essential part except for that I think.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_01
 We'll not probably not get away from some longer design.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_01
 Because you also have to know which way around to point this thing.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_01
 Because it doesn't have a cord like joysticks do.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_01
 Batteries go weak as well. So after a while you have to point it towards the equipment you want to control with it.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 Show which is the front which is the back.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_03
 It's impossible to have it to where it would work with like a sensor on either side.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_03
 So that either way you're pointing it will work.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_01
 Of course, the more technology you stick in that, the more.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_01
 More.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_01
 More expensive.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_01
 So.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_01
 Of course, you can do.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, of course, it will be evident after a while.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_01
 If you look at it, it will be evident which way around to point it since you have the numbers and the buttons and stuff.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_01
 But it's about the instinctual thing.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_01
 I can just grab it. You don't have to just look at it, you know, which way around to point it.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_01
 Otherwise, the design of the point of putting two sensors on both sides would probably work.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_02
 Even if you design it in some way that, you know, isn't a rectangle but still pointed in a direction that had a definite point.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_02
 So that's your thing.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, I'm like that instead.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_02
 And there you can know which way you're in the point today.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry to interrupt, but we have a warning.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, we had a time.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_03
 Well.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_03
 Just to finish up, should we go with this plan?

0:22:16	SPEAKER_03
 Let's start making some...

0:22:29	SPEAKER_03
 Our good ideas, what are not?

0:22:31	SPEAKER_02
 Let's say, what's he saying?

0:22:32	SPEAKER_02
 Because now what we need to do for the next meeting, I think.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_03
 So, we're going to finish now.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_03
 Project manager will design a better meeting for the next time around.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_03
 You're a little bit more prepared.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_03
 And, all right.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_03
 Good meeting.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.
