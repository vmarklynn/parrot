0:00:00	None
 Okay.

0:00:01	None
 Oh, that's not going to work.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:00:41	None
 Okay.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_03
 As you all know, we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_03
 I'm Nick Debusk.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_03
 I'm the project manager.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_03
 We'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing and what your role is.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_03
 Go ahead.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_00
 I'm Corinne Weiden and I will be the marketing expert and in each of the three phases, I will have a different role in the function design phase.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_00
 I will be talking about user requirements specification and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled and I'll be doing research to figure this out.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_00
 In the conceptual design phase, I will be dealing with trend watching and I'll be doing marketing research on the web.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_00
 And then finally in the detailed design phase, I will be doing product evaluation and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all of the requirements to see how we did.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_02
 Hi, I'm Ryan.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_02
 I'm the user interface designer.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_02
 Likewise, I have three different roles for each stage of the design.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_02
 The functional design is looking at the technical functions of remote control.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_02
 In the concept design, the user interface, how the user reacts with the product and the detailed design, sort of like the user interface design, what they might be looking for, things like fashions, what makes, how we're going to make it special.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_02
 That's about it.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_01
 I'm Manuel.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_01
 I'm the industrial designer in this project.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_01
 In the functional design phase, I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_01
 We'll discuss what functions the product has to fulfill and so on and so on.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_01
 I suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_01
 In the conceptual design, I'll be mostly dealing with properties and materials of our product.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_01
 The detailed design and the detailed design, I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_01
 Pretty much working together, obviously, on the design.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_03
 We've got our opening, our agenda is the opening acquaintance, which we've kind of done.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_03
 Tool training, project, plan, discussion, and then closing.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_03
 Grant tool of 25 minutes we have here.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_03
 We are putting together a new remote control.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_03
 We want it to be something original.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, we're not only an electronics company, but a fashion conscious electronics company.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_03
 So we want it to be trendy.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_03
 And we want it to be easy to use.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_03
 We've got the functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design, which basically is the three of you.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_03
 Well, functional design.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_03
 Do we have any ideas of maybe, let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have?

0:05:19	SPEAKER_03
 Then we can go into how we're going to design it and how we're going to do the detailing

0:05:26	SPEAKER_02
 on it. Well, functional remote control is just a change of channels.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_02
 It's a main function.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_03
 So we want it to be a TV remote or do we want it to do other things besides just be a television remote?

0:05:43	SPEAKER_02
 I suppose trying to make it a universal remote can work on all sort of electrical products in one person's house.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_02
 But they all sort of have the same role changing channels, volumes, and then programming.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_02
 I think they all work on the same principles.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_02
 I don't actually know.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_02
 Tyler, but is it just infrared?

0:06:11	SPEAKER_02
 Is that sent out?

0:06:12	SPEAKER_03
 I think, yeah, universal remote.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_03
 This is my first go around with creating remote control.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we're all in the same boat here.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_02
 One thing I thought of when we were in remote control is you always lose them.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_02
 So I have those away I find them quite easily.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_03
 So we should fit you.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_03
 But our remote control up to where it has a tracking device.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_00
 Like a tracking device.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_03
 Or you get those.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_02
 Or like a...

0:06:50	SPEAKER_02
 You whistle.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_02
 I'll make a noise.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_03
 It makes a noise.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_03
 There's a button on the TV that you press.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_01
 Do you get it?

0:07:02	SPEAKER_02
 Genuinely all remote was a sort of quite similar in their appearance.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_03
 It's just long.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_03
 So they're kind of like long and rectangular.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_00
 We want something crazy.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_03
 We want something new that's going to stand out.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_03
 A modern.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_03
 So our remote should be.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_02
 It's very close to a ball.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe like user friendly like a little.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_00
 You know where you can use both hands like a little keyboard.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_02
 People, I thought maybe because people always sent a thorough remote control about the place to one other.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_02
 If it was in a ball and you got your controls on the side.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_01
 Well there are of course certain restrictions.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_01
 You can't have it be any form and fulfill all functions at the same time.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_01
 So there are obviously some restrictions we have to apply here.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_01
 However, one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be that refers to the material pretty much?

0:08:02	SPEAKER_01
 What are we going to build the thing out of?

0:08:05	SPEAKER_01
 How sturdy is it going to be to be one to it to last longer or rather have people.

0:08:13	None
 Whatever.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_01
 So buy one.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_03
 So we want to be sturdy.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_03
 We wanted to hold up to somebody's child throwing it across the room or as you said people kind of throw it.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_03
 So ball shaped.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_03
 You know, if it were ball shaped, maybe kind of cast on the outside.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_03
 So we want it to be modern, fun, sturdy.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_03
 So our form and our function.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_03
 We want it to be easy to find.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_03
 What else do we want it to do?

0:09:26	SPEAKER_03
 So we want it to be universal.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_03
 It's something that we're supposed to sell for about 25 euros.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_03
 It's goals for profits are I think somewhere around 50 million euros what they want to make on it.

0:09:52	None
 So.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_00
 Also, since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association, maybe we want to make it something that would globally appeal.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_00
 That's more on the research end, but the marketing.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_03
 The marketing, you know, how maybe marketing you could find out what is the most universally appealing remote control out there.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_00
 And maybe as far as design goes, maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_00
 Because maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_03
 You guys have any ideas for what it should look like?

0:11:07	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we could draw it up on the board over there.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_03
 Some ideas.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_03
 We want to be a job ball drop the ball and maybe where the buttons are located.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_02
 Or my original idea was just simply sort of a sphere where maybe you see where it's connected together.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_02
 And then when you open it out, it could be a flip, like a flip film.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_02
 And then when you fold it out the middle, maybe a hinge, that would be the strongest part of it.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_02
 And then if you did use a hinge, it was just two parts.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_02
 And then you'd have just like any buttons.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_02
 Things inside.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_02
 I think sometimes you're amongst too many buttons.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe as simple as possible.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_02
 There's a few of those inside as possible.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_02
 And then there was the idea for just something maybe if it had like some kind of light or something or lights around it, it's looking a bit like some kind of Star Wars at the moment, no?

0:12:28	SPEAKER_02
 To be fair.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_02
 That was a sort of simple idea.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_02
 I had any note you could feel it about.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_02
 It would almost be like a ball.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_02
 So that was just the idea I had.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_02
 I don't have any of the others or the ideas.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_01
 One problem you'd get with this design is the ball is a nice idea because of its stability.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_01
 But of course, since it's a ball, it'll roll.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_01
 So you'd have to have it flat on the side of the beast down here somewhere.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 Take away that part.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_01
 That's one of the big issues.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_01
 Also you risk the hinges here.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_01
 That's a problem.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_02
 They didn't have that shallow beef.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_02
 That's an idea.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_01
 That's interesting, of course.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_01
 But that's of course a weak point.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_03
 How would we go about making, you know, getting rid of our weak points?

0:13:30	SPEAKER_03
 What?

0:13:31	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, but we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_03
 Not to put you on the spot, but.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_03
 What did you say your title was again?

0:13:44	SPEAKER_03
 I'm the industrial designer.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 The industrial designer.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_01
 So, well, the point is that.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_01
 Well, maybe.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_01
 The shape is perhaps not the most ideal.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_01
 As stable as it is, there must be a compromise between.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_01
 I suppose there's a possibility design.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, I'm sure I think of like the design of others.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_02
 I can't think of anything other than the long rectangle.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_02
 For a more sort of faster ones, but.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_02
 There's nothing being done sort of out of.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_02
 That's not new.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's not innovative.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_03
 It's, you know, everybody does longer remote because it's easy.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_03
 It's stable.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_00
 I'll do something.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_00
 So if.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_03
 No, go ahead.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_00
 My idea was just to have it be kind of.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_00
 Like a.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_00
 Keyboard type shape, you know, like video games.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_00
 So, but maybe.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, that would be kind of big and bulky.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_00
 We could also try to do the hinge then.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_00
 So it could like flip out that way.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_02
 I think definitely doing something different.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_02
 It's a good idea.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, very design something that's sort of like.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_02
 Well, suppose not always everybody's having the same, but something that would maybe fit in the hand.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's easy.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_03
 Something with a grip.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_03
 Because even I suppose even with the ball.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_02
 You still might be.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_02
 It's still.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_03
 It might not be the easiest to hold on to.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_03
 So perhaps the.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_03
 The joystick.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the keyboard idea.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_03
 Might work better.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_03
 But again, people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it's.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think it's definitely got to be a one handed.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_02
 A one handed job.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_03
 I feel like I'm just shooting everything down here.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_00
 You're the boss.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_01
 One handed design, you also have a problem of the size, you know, from cell phones, they can be too small.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_01
 It's small.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_01
 It probably looks better, but.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_01
 It may not be as functional.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_03
 Fortunately, we've got about five minutes here to come up with our.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_03
 Remote control idea and start rolling with it.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_03
 We've talked about our experiences with remote control and.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_03
 We've got a couple ideas.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_03
 See here.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_03
 What if we had what if we had not only.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_03
 Say we went with the ball, the ball function.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_03
 But maybe we give it sort of grips along the side.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_03
 To make it easier to hold on to.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_03
 So it's easier to hold on to that way.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, that will then remove some of our.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_03
 Our ball, unless this, unless this part were raised.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_03
 Say the cover flips over and covers that part.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_03
 So the grip is.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_03
 No, that wouldn't work either.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_03
 But if we're going to make it flat on the bottom.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_03
 Then that eliminates our ball anyways.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_03
 So if it were.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_03
 Flat on the bottom and then had the.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_03
 Sort of grips in the side here, I guess.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_03
 And then we have the problem with the hinge.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_03
 So if we're flat on the bottom, it's not going to roll away.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_03
 It'll stay where we want.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_01
 Questions also.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_01
 Do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_03
 That's true.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_01
 It's probably going to lie around open all the time anyway.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_01
 So I don't know if a lid is a good idea.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_01
 The stability point of view.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_01
 It certainly is.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_01
 But also.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_01
 You have to face it and take into account the more of these things.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_01
 Break by accident.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_01
 The more we sell.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_01
 So.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_01
 Don't make.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_03
 So we don't have it flip open.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_03
 We just have a ball.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_02
 But then maybe go back to the.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_02
 Something along those things.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_03
 So then we forget the ball.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_03
 It looks cool.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_03
 It looks cool, but it's really not.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_03
 It's not functional.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_03
 So we've got our sort of keyboard kind.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_03
 What if we flipped it around here so that it were.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry, that doesn't look anything like what you had there.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_03
 So it's up and down.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_03
 You hold it this way.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_03
 It's like the rectangular again only with a couple of jutting out points.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_03
 But it's one handed.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 The question is what makes those game pads functional.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's pretty much the form for the hand.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_01
 So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_01
 Makes it nice.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_01
 So that's the essential part except for that I think.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_01
 We'll not probably not get away from some longer design.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_01
 Because you also have to know which way around to point this thing.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_01
 Because it doesn't have a chord like joysticks do.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_01
 And the batteries go weak as well.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_01
 So after a while you have to point it towards the equipment you want to control with it.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 Show which is the front, which is the back.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_03
 Is it possible to have it to where it would work with like a sensor on either side?

0:21:07	SPEAKER_03
 So that either way you're pointing it would work.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_01
 Of course the more technology you stick in that, the more it'll cost.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_01
 Of course you can do.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_01
 I mean of course it will be evident after a while.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_01
 If you look at it it will be evident which way around to point it since you have the numbers and the buttons and stuff.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_01
 But it's about an instinctual thing.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_01
 You can just grab it and you don't have to look at it which way around to point it.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_01
 Otherwise the design of the point of putting two sensors on both sides would probably work.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_02
 Even if you designed it in a way that isn't a rectangle but still pointed in a direction that had a definite point.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_02
 So that's your thing.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_02
 Something like that instead.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_02
 And there you can know which way you can point today.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_02
