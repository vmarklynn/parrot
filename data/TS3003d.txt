0:00:00	None
 Hello.

0:00:07	None
 Good afternoon.

0:00:10	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry I'm a little late.

0:00:13	None
 Oh, probably.

0:00:14	None
 It got stuck in the traffic.

0:00:21	SPEAKER_02
 It's possible this time of day.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_02
 It starts at 3 o'clock.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_01
 Let me see. Our fourth and last meeting.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_01
 There he is.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, this is our last meeting.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_01
 In this meeting we will discuss our final design.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_01
 And we will do some evaluation about not only the product, but also the project.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_01
 And then we're going to close the project today as well.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_01
 So, after that you'll be free to go and spend all your money.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_01
 This design, detailed design meeting, we will discuss the look and feel of the design, the usability interface design, and we will do the product evaluation.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_01
 In order to do that we have this agenda.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_01
 We will have the prototype presentation first.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_01
 Then we will set up some evaluation criteria.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_01
 Then we will look at the finance.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_01
 We will have to see if everything we want to do is also possible within our budget.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_01
 Because everything costs money and the more functions you want to have, the more money it will cost.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_01
 So, we will see if it fits within the 12 and a half euro per remote.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_01
 We will see that later.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_01
 Then we will do the project evaluation and the closing after that.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_01
 We've got 40 minutes.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_01
 So, we will be finished at half past three.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_01
 But first we will do the prototype presentation.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_01
 So, if somebody wants to sit forward.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_00
 Well, this is what me and Richard came up with.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_00
 The default spot for the on-off button, the mute button just below that.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_00
 Then there's the volume and channel selectors.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_00
 Simple plus minus button.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_00
 We thought of a help button.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_00
 If you hold it and you press another button, the help goes to the LCD screen.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_00
 Then there's the 0 to 1 to 0 buttons, a button for teletext, a button for the subtitles and the company logo.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_00
 So, it's rather simple prototype.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_00
 We'll have to see from testing how do users take it.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_02
 Is this a moment where we can ask questions about the functionality?

0:03:33	SPEAKER_00
 Sure. Just pop in at any time.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_02
 When you're in teletext, usually your buttons where you just press it and you go to the next teletext page.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_04
 That's just the normal, as the normal remote controls.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_04
 So, you press it, you come in page 100.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_04
 You can use the normal 1 to 0 buttons.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_04
 You can also use the button for changing the channel, so the shifting button.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_04
 For shifting up in the teletext and shifting down.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_01
 I thought in a few meetings earlier, we tried to give it simple.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_01
 Just a few buttons and large buttons.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_01
 But I think these are all together.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_01
 Quite a few buttons.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_01
 I'm wondering if we really need all of those buttons.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_00
 I think if you look at most controls, they've got more buttons than this.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_00
 And, well, the on-off button, it's a necessity.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_00
 You can't drop that one.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_00
 The volume and channel buttons, you obviously need those.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_00
 The mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume down button twice.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_00
 So, we could cancel that one.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_00
 I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_04
 Or you can build in when you press one button.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_04
 Long time.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_04
 We just discussed that already.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_04
 But we think all people don't know that option.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_04
 They just put in a press button.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_00
 Well, you can't leave out the number buttons, I guess.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_01
 And it takes some subtitles.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_00
 So, it's rather basic already.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_02
 I think so.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_02
 That's what I pointed out earlier.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_02
 You just make a control for just the TV.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_02
 There's just not much to gain here.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_01
 So, yeah, somebody, but, you can do something about the design of the buttons there.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_00
 It's not a lot of hard to draw on the whiteboard, but they're supposed to be equal sized round with a little logo on it for the volume, the dry angle and stuff.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_00
 Just for recognition.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_04
 And we don't need a letter or...

0:06:42	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_04
 So, because we use the little display, we don't have to use it.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_00
 So, and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons with a different color than the case, so they jump out.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_00
 That's about it.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_01
 That's nice.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_01
 Then, because we only have 30 minutes left.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_01
 I will move on to the finance part, which is pretty exciting to see if it's all possible what we want to do.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_01
 And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for 12 and half euros.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_01
 If we see...

0:07:35	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if I'm filming correctly, so just correct me if you see something wrong.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_01
 I counted two batteries, but maybe we can also use one.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if it's possible.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_01
 It's rechargeable.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_01
 It's rechargeable.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_01
 That's two euros off.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_01
 We need the advanced chip, so there's not much to say there.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_01
 Here we have the single curve.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_01
 We can see that the difference between N-curved and the single curve is one euro.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know, but I think the single curve is good for the design and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_01
 I think we have to keep that.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_01
 Then we have the case material supplements.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_01
 It's plastic.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_01
 It's the cheapest one we need.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_01
 That's not much to say either.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_01
 The biggest cost are the buttons.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our cost though, because we will have to get 12 and half euros at the end.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 Let's first count the buttons we have now, because I'm 16.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_01
 That will be even more than 18 euros.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_01
 So 17.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, including the help?

0:09:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, 17.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 I think we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long or pressing down a number.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_01
 Long.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_01
 That saves us one euro already.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_01
 Then we have got 15, I think.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_01
 15.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_01
 And this is...

0:09:50	SPEAKER_02
 I assume you count the volume and channel things for two buttons each, right?

0:09:55	SPEAKER_01
 Those are one, I think.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_04
 I think actually there are two buttons.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_04
 It's just one bit.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_04
 Two, one big button, but they are more expensive than the small ones I hear.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but it's not stated in this class.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one by pressing...

0:10:26	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I'm thinking maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_01
 That's a possibility as well.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_02
 That would cut the cost.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_01
 So, and it's good for the design as well, so you can make...

0:10:41	SPEAKER_01
 Let's see.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_01
 Like this.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_01
 Looks a bit like a...

0:11:04	SPEAKER_01
 A cross.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_01
 Min?

0:11:14	SPEAKER_04
 But I don't know if it's here.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I still got four buttons, but just...

0:11:24	SPEAKER_04
 So...

0:11:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think they count the materials.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_04
 Not a better one, itself, but...

0:11:32	SPEAKER_04
 On the chip there.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, on the chip you got still four as well.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_01
 But I think because we have the other ones, chip, we can just count this as one button.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_02
 But now, but I think...

0:11:46	SPEAKER_02
 I think this really is four buttons, anyhow.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it is, but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the 12 and a half euros.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_01
 Also, the LC display.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's too expensive for the display we use.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_00
 I think they try...

0:12:12	SPEAKER_00
 If we leave out the display, we can also save money on the chip.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_01
 That's right, but what's the biggest advantage of our remote then?

0:12:25	SPEAKER_02
 Only the docking station, I guess?

0:12:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_00
 The docking station isn't even in this schematic.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_00
 No, it's not even taking into the price.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_01
 That's extra.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we should move to a different supplier.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_01
 That's an option.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_01
 Poland, something.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_01
 Polish, a player.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_01
 Don't you think we can...

0:12:52	SPEAKER_01
 If we can count this as one button and integrate these buttons in three,

0:12:59	SPEAKER_00
 then we save a lot of money as well. We could save money on it, but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people?

0:13:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_00
 My motor can't even send an SMS message.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 That's a point.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_04
 We kind of buy a remote control when you can use it.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_04
 We missed...

0:13:31	SPEAKER_04
 Stay below 1250 or...

0:13:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_04
 Can't...

0:13:39	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_02
 Well, since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier, more easy, maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little, especially since we have those nice features.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but we have to stick to the 12 and a half years.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_01
 We don't have any more budget to the market.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_04
 It's possible to make one for 1250.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think so.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_01
 And if you leave out the LC display and if you use less buttons, say...

0:14:25	SPEAKER_01
 You can't use the single chip.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_04
 There it is.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_04
 Do you want to make a...

0:14:38	SPEAKER_04
 So fancy and...

0:14:44	SPEAKER_04
 Quick looking.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, objective option.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_04
 So you can stay below 1250.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's difficult as well.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_02
 Basically becoming a choice between either a good remote and a higher production cost and just any other remote control.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_01
 Or we can leave out the 10 buttons and take one scroll wheel for the program numbers.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_01
 That was one.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_01
 Because then we save 10 buttons and we have five and one.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_01
 And let's see if we have this one and we've got the other ones.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_00
 We're getting closer.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_02
 But how would the scroll wheel work here?

0:15:42	SPEAKER_01
 Then you will...

0:15:48	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can...

0:15:53	SPEAKER_01
 If you scroll, you will see the numbers on the LCD display.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_01
 Until you've got the right number and then you push it.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_02
 That would bring up the price of the scroll wheel also.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_01
 Alright, so you scroll and push.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_01
 But then you can push some other buttons as well.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_00
 You could just not scroll for half a second.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second, then it turns to that channel.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_02
 I think that would be the end of our usability.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_01
 It would definitely drop cost a lot.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_01
 And we need battery.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_01
 And the regular chip is not possible.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_00
 It has to be advanced.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_00
 If you want to use an LCD screen, you need an advanced chip.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_01
 Now we can save a euro by a flat design.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_01
 That's an option we can...

0:17:04	SPEAKER_01
 Then we're almost there.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_00
 If you could just leave out one more button.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_04
 Or we have to skip the subtitle button.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_01
 But I think that is a big advantage for us.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_01
 But can we integrate the data text and the subtitles in one button?

0:17:29	SPEAKER_01
 I think so.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_02
 If you push it three times.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_02
 The teletext subtitles are right now.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_02
 You just push the teletext button.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_02
 Go to page 888.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_02
 And the teletext disappears.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_02
 But the subtitles stay there.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_04
 But if you push the data twice.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_00
 What if you have to scroll to page 888?

0:17:49	SPEAKER_02
 That could be like the scroll to page 8.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_02
 Scroll to page 8.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_02
 But then again, there would be just an option for older people.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_02
 You don't even know what a scroll wheel is.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_02
 Holding a remote with the respect to have 10 buttons for the numbers 1 to 0.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_02
 There are only 5 buttons on it.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_02
 And a scroll wheel.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_01
 I think if you make a good advertisement on television and in the guide, you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_01
 You can just make it real simple.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_01
 It saves a lot of money and we can keep our LCD screen which can provide extra information how to use the scroll wheel, how to use the other buttons as subtitles.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_01
 And it's good for the innovative design as well.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_01
 If you would erase these.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_01
 If you would erase them.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_01
 If you would put the...

0:19:20	SPEAKER_01
 It looks a bit odd maybe.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_02
 It's a pretty big scroll wheel.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_03
 Something like that.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 Then you've got the scroll wheel.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_01
 If you erase this one.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 And these are two buttons then.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_00
 You could make two buttons out of that and just if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll wheel.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_00
 So that would save two buttons if you do the same for the channel.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_01
 That's really a good idea I think.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_01
 And that will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_01
 So we make one for the volume, one for the channel.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_01
 So if we've got one, two, three.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_00
 If we leave out all those buttons perhaps you can go with the flat case and make it smaller overall.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_00
 So if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the enough button, the screen right under that then the scroll button.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_00
 You get a much smaller remote.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_01
 So you can decrease this one to four buttons.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_04
 You can make a big remote control for just the same price as a small one.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_04
 You have to pay for the double curved or single curved.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_01
 It's more the moles in which they are being made I think single curved is really easy to fill in and cases come right out of the machine and single curves you have to have a different machine than a flat one.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_01
 I think this is a really easy one.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_01
 Does everybody think about the flat or single curved design?

0:22:46	SPEAKER_02
 I still think we should go for the single curved design.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_02
 Rich at argument was very good.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_02
 Since we have to cut costs.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_02
 I'm agreeing with the use of research and see what the options are.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_01
 I think we can keep the single curved one just to express our LCD screen a bit more.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_01
 So people will use it more and especially for the help functions will be good if we have scroll button.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_01
 It's necessary to have a good help function as well.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_01
 I think it was better to have this price this bit earlier before we went on to the whole design.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_01
 But I'm glad we could make a bit.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_01
 That's pretty different.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_02
 This is not really like for the group we were making or remote.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_02
 This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_02
 If other people like familiar firms and familiar stuff, this is not familiar for them.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_02
 No, but I think they have to do a lot of convincing them.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_04
 I think the most, but they know the scroll buttons from old radio.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_04
 They also have buttons like that for changing.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_01
 We can stick it out.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_01
 It's like an old button.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe that's recognizable for them as well.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_01
 That's a good one.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm afraid we have to move on.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_01
 It's less frightening, I think, if they see this design, they think there are only five buttons.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_02
 It might be confusing too.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_04
 That's very special.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_01
 I would buy it.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but you're not 60.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_01
 I would buy it if I was 60.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_01
 No, I didn't know.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_01
 Articos and the 12 and 12 euros?

0:25:37	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, they are.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_01
 No, but we can go on with the project evaluation.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_01
 Let's see.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_01
 I can sit down.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_01
 I think we still have 15 minutes left, so nice on schedule.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_01
 The project process.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_02
 So I like to set up all these criteria.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_02
 Evaluation criteria.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_01
 That was the point I forgot.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_01
 There we are.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_01
 Evaluation criteria.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_01
 Go ahead.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_01
 We've got five minutes, I think.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_01
 Five more minutes?

0:26:24	SPEAKER_01
 No, we've got 15 minutes, but okay.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so I did some literature study, analysis of the requirements we set up earlier.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_02
 Translated it into criteria, which would be these.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_02
 It's a remote fancy, a shaped look and feel.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_02
 Innovative, what new functions are there.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_02
 Easy to use.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_02
 Is it functional?

0:27:09	SPEAKER_02
 Are there not too many functions?

0:27:12	SPEAKER_02
 Those functions are there useful?

0:27:16	SPEAKER_02
 The cost.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_02
 The target group is the remote really for the group we're making it for.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_02
 And great cognitive ability.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_02
 If our company is easily recognizable, their company made it.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_02
 So we're supposed to evaluate it right now.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_02
 Let's see.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_02
 It's hard because the minutes of our last meeting were not here.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_01
 That's because my pen failed to upload his data.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_01
 I tried to, but it's giving errors by downloading software.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_02
 It's the design fancy on a scale of one to seven.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's fancy.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_04
 Six.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_02
 Good.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_02
 Is the design innovative?

0:28:24	SPEAKER_02
 Very.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_02
 So with our LCD-

0:28:27	SPEAKER_01
 Set that up station. Let's go to buttons.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_01
 Seven.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_01
 Seven?

0:28:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_01
 So we've got 20 cents for our docking station.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_02
 Should be dual.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_02
 Is the design easy to use?

0:28:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_02
 It's a bit dodgy.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_01
 Well, would be for us, but for all of the...

0:28:53	SPEAKER_01
 I would say four or five.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_01
 Four or five.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_01
 It's between four.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_02
 I'd go for four or two.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_01
 Is it functional?

0:29:03	SPEAKER_02
 Is the design functional?

0:29:05	SPEAKER_02
 Do we have all functions that we want to include?

0:29:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_02
 I think we do.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_02
 Do we have too many functions?

0:29:11	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_02
 I think so.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_01
 It's pretty slow.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's seven.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_02
 Seven.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, and do we take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control, like it getting lost?

0:29:28	SPEAKER_02
 And...

0:29:29	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, sorry.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_00
 I haven't thought of that one.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_01
 It was...

0:29:32	SPEAKER_01
 I think we do.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_01
 I had them work there.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_01
 They are ugly, not very functional, and getting lost.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_02
 Are the production costs within the preset limits?

0:29:47	SPEAKER_02
 Well, they are now.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_02
 Does the design fit the group of focus?

0:29:57	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's a free.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_01
 I think with a new radio button, I think it's better.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_04
 We have to test this.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, no.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_00
 I still...

0:30:11	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's too fancy to fleshy.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_02
 I think your button is not exactly what older people expect of remote control.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_02
 True.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_01
 I will give you the four.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_02
 I think I'd go for two.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_02
 I'd go for three.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_04
 So...

0:30:34	SPEAKER_03
 I think I'll do three.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_02
 Is the company recognizable?

0:30:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, it is.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_02
 Or is it the logo there?

0:30:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:30:52	SPEAKER_01
 And they want to put fashion in their products in the slogan of the company.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_01
 We have the removable front cases.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:31:05	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's very recognizable.

0:31:07	None
 Yep.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_02
 So, that would be this.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_02
 I was also supposed to calculate the score, but thought we would have another private...

0:31:21	SPEAKER_02
 We've got the company after this.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_00
 Is this...

0:31:26	SPEAKER_02
 Like after this?

0:31:27	SPEAKER_01
 Are we done?

0:31:28	SPEAKER_01
 We've got to evaluate it.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_02
 Anyhow, these are seven factors.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_02
 Time seven is forty...

0:31:37	SPEAKER_02
 Something?

0:31:38	SPEAKER_02
 Two?

0:31:39	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_01
 Nine?

0:31:41	SPEAKER_01
 No, 49.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_02
 Minus one.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_02
 Minus three, minus four.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_02
 Minus four.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_02
 It will be minus eight.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_02
 Forty-one, out of forty-nine.

0:32:03	None
 That's...

0:32:04	SPEAKER_03
 I'm around eighty percent.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_02
 I guess I'll just type that in on the bottom here.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_01
 That's eighty-four percent.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's a pretty nice score.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_02
 So that would be the evaluation.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, thank you.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_01
 So that brings us to the project evaluation.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_01
 Project process.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_01
 Did we move through the right faces, you think, along the process?

0:33:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should have the finance thing a lot earlier.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_02
 In the design phase.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_01
 So a lack of information about prices.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_01
 So that's the evaluation.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_02
 Was there room for creativity?

0:33:40	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_00
 Not too much.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_01
 It's because of the finance sheet.

0:33:47	None
 Yeah.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_02
 It wasn't enough room, but the finance.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_02
 The room was...

0:33:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_02
 And I would have liked to go for the younger users also.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_02
 But I was able to access internet and get something of your own.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_01
 Strictions.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_01
 Internet access.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_01
 Leadership.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_01
 Was it clear what everybody had to do?

0:34:19	SPEAKER_01
 According to their roles and functions.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_01
 Teamwork.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_01
 Did it work out?

0:34:29	SPEAKER_01
 Working together.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_01
 Also, you too, here with the...

0:34:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it was okay.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_01
 Last phase.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_01
 Nice.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_00
 The tasks are very strictured, so you can just do step by step.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_00
 It was very easy.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_01
 Strictions.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_01
 Where the means efficient for the tasks we had to do?

0:34:57	SPEAKER_01
 Or where they...

0:34:58	SPEAKER_01
 Too much.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_00
 Well, the smart board, the drawing is just a pain in the ass, but...

0:35:05	SPEAKER_00
 Smart board.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_00
 The digital pen is very nice.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_01
 If it wants to download this, very data.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_01
 Smart board was irritating.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_01
 So you rather wanted to have a flip over or something else?

0:35:38	SPEAKER_00
 A flip over or a more precise...

0:35:42	SPEAKER_01
 Faster as well.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_01
 Flip over.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_04
 But if you want to share of when you make a picture like this on the presentation, it's easier to share it with other people.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_04
 So you can save it and put it on the internet or...

0:36:09	SPEAKER_04
 In shared folder or shared.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I tried to open the file on my laptop, but...

0:36:16	SPEAKER_01
 No, it didn't work.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_01
 No, you need the smart board application, I think.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_01
 But I think you can...

0:36:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_01
 It should be possible.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you can export this image.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it must be.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_02
 You should have done that, man.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_01
 So the sharing of information was okay.

0:36:37	None
 Turn this here.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's working.

0:36:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's been in here on the table.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's possible.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_01
 That's nice.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_01
 We've found new IDs for having this kind of meeting.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:37:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, maybe...

0:37:13	SPEAKER_04
 Just give the numbers of...

0:37:19	SPEAKER_04
 One of our...

0:37:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_04
 So it's easier to lose things like that on a computer.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_04
 So it's like a university.

0:37:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_01
 So everybody puts his own score and then it mediates the score and you can get one.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's better.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_01
 So it's...

0:37:48	SPEAKER_01
 How do we go?

0:37:50	None
 Okay.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_01
 Any further action?

0:38:04	SPEAKER_01
 Right, there we are.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_01
 Any more ideas or questions about the project or about the product?

0:38:24	SPEAKER_01
 It goes, I think...

0:38:35	SPEAKER_01
 Then that's it.

0:38:37	SPEAKER_01
 Get to our last few articles within the budget.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_00
 So we are considering we are not going to make a docking station.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_01
 That's a good point.

0:38:53	SPEAKER_01
 But maybe because of the docking station, the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher.

0:39:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:39:01	SPEAKER_01
 And I think you can compensate that as well.

0:39:05	SPEAKER_01
 So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem because it's very cheap to make as well.

0:39:11	SPEAKER_01
 Do we think we are going to get 12 and a half million?

0:39:15	SPEAKER_01
 What was it?

0:39:17	SPEAKER_01
 15 million.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_01
 15 million.

0:39:19	SPEAKER_01
 I think we will.

0:39:21	SPEAKER_01
 If we are going to export this product, it's innovative.

0:39:25	SPEAKER_01
 Especially in America.

0:39:27	SPEAKER_01
 People are pretty.

0:39:29	SPEAKER_01
 Take a dent.

0:39:31	SPEAKER_01
 Sometimes.

0:39:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, still nothing.

0:39:33	SPEAKER_02
 I mean if we are going to make a scroll button anyway, we can do more.

0:39:38	SPEAKER_02
 You can do more for the younger people and for the older people.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:39:43	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe we should just refocus.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_01
 Just put it on the market for everybody.

0:39:48	SPEAKER_01
 Specifically for everybody.

0:39:49	SPEAKER_01
 You can change markets by changing the front cover.

0:39:54	SPEAKER_01
 That's one thing you can change it with.

0:39:56	SPEAKER_01
 So you can also try to reach the younger people by putting fancy covers on the market.

0:40:05	SPEAKER_01
 Just as a test.

0:40:06	SPEAKER_01
 See how it works?

0:40:07	SPEAKER_01
 That's I think a good advantage.

0:40:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is.

0:40:17	SPEAKER_02
 Then we would be with older people.

0:40:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:40:21	SPEAKER_02
 Even if it were their covers.

0:40:24	SPEAKER_01
 Then I think we can have our little celebration right now.

0:40:29	SPEAKER_01
 That's it.

0:40:30	SPEAKER_01
 I think we still have to fill in one more questionnaire.

0:40:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:40:37	SPEAKER_01
 I think, I don't know, I didn't get a message from the ending of the...

0:40:45	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I think I have one.

0:40:46	SPEAKER_01
 Five more minutes.

0:40:48	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that's nice.

0:40:51	SPEAKER_01
 Then we still have some questions.

0:40:54	SPEAKER_01
 If somebody has some questions, they can ask them now.

0:40:58	SPEAKER_01
 We can put these in the project folder as well.

0:41:02	SPEAKER_01
 This one.

0:41:18	SPEAKER_01
 Export it.

0:41:20	SPEAKER_01
 Picture, I think.

0:41:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:41:23	SPEAKER_01
 This is another, that's where I guess.

0:41:50	SPEAKER_01
 Let's see, project folder.

0:41:55	SPEAKER_03
 I don't.

0:42:00	SPEAKER_01
 My documents.

0:42:07	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe they will save it.

0:42:10	SPEAKER_01
 I just put it in my documents and that's okay.

0:42:27	SPEAKER_01
 I think I'm going to make our final presentation now.

0:42:31	SPEAKER_01
 You're supposed to make it.

0:42:34	SPEAKER_01
 I will be back in about 10 minutes to show you the final presentation.

0:42:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:42:41	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:42:42	SPEAKER_01
 Summary of the project.

0:42:44	SPEAKER_02
 Are we supposed to go into our rooms again?

0:42:47	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we have to fill in our questionnaire.

0:42:50	SPEAKER_01
 I think you'll get the questionnaire in your room.

0:42:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:42:54	SPEAKER_01
 And then I'll meet you in, think about 10 minutes.

0:42:58	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:42:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:43:00	None
 Thank you.

0:43:03	SPEAKER_01
 Hopefully my panel download is software.

0:43:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:43:08	SPEAKER_01
 Or data.

0:43:10	SPEAKER_02
 That would be nice.

0:43:38	None
 Okay.

0:43:43	None
 Okay.

0:43:47	None
 Okay.

0:43:51	None
 Okay.
