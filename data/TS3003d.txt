0:00:22	SPEAKER_02
 Hello.

0:00:24	SPEAKER_02
 Good afternoon sorry I am a late.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_02
 No broadly.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_02
 Good second traffic.

0:00:29	SPEAKER_01
 It's possible this time of day starts at 3 o'clock.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_01
 Let me see.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_01
 Our fourth and last meeting.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_01
 There he is.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, this is our last meeting.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_01
 This meeting we will discuss our final design.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_01
 And we will do some evaluation about not only the product, but also the project.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_01
 And then we're going to close the project today as well.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_01
 So after that you'll be free to go and spend all your money.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_01
 And this design, detailed design meeting, we will discuss the look and feel of the design, the usability interface design, and we will do the product evaluation.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_01
 In order to do that, we have this agenda.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_01
 We will have the prototype presentation first.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_01
 Then we will set up some evaluation criteria.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_01
 Then we will look at the finance.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_01
 We will have to see if everything we want to do is also possible within our budget.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_01
 Because everything goes money.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_01
 And the more functions you want to have, the more money it will cost.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_01
 So we have to see if it fits within the 12.5 euro per remote.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_01
 We will see that later.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_01
 Then we will do the project evaluation and the closing after that.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_01
 We've got 40 minutes.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_01
 So we will be finished at half past three.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_01
 But first, we will do the prototype presentation.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_01
 So if there's somebody else for it.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_00
 Well, this is what me and Richard came up with.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_00
 The default spot for the on-off button.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_00
 The mute button just below that.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_00
 Then there's the volume and channel selectors.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_00
 Simple plus minus button.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_00
 We thought of a help button.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_00
 If you hold it and you press another button, the help goes to the LCD screen.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_00
 Then there's the 0 to 1 to 0 buttons.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_00
 A button for a teletext.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_00
 A button for the subtitles and the company logo.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_00
 So it's rather simple prototype.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_00
 And we'll have to see from testing how the user's take it.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_02
 Is this the moment where we ask?

0:03:31	SPEAKER_02
 Where can I ask questions about the functionality?

0:03:33	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_00
 Just pop in at any time.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_02
 When you're in teletext, there are usually buttons where you just press it and you go to the next teletext page.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_04
 That's just the normal remote controls.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_04
 So you push it.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_04
 You come in page 100.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_04
 You can use the normal 1 to 0 buttons.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_04
 You can also use the better for changing the channel.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_04
 So the shifting better.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_04
 For shifting up in the teletext and shifting down.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_01
 But I thought in a few meetings earlier we tried to give it simple.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_01
 Just a few buttons and large buttons.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_01
 But I think these are all together.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_01
 Quite a few buttons.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm wondering if we really need all of those buttons.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_00
 I think if you look at most controls, they've got more buttons than this.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_00
 And well, the on-off button is a necessity.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_00
 You can't drop that one.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_00
 The volume and channel buttons, you obviously need those.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_00
 The mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume down button twice.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_00
 So we could cancel that one.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_00
 I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_04
 Or you can build in when you press one button.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_04
 Long time.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_04
 We just discussed that already.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_04
 We think all people don't know that option.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_00
 Well, you can't leave out the number buttons, I guess.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_01
 And take some subtitles.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_00
 So it's rather basic already.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_02
 That's what I pointed out earlier, you just make control for just the TV. There's just not much to gain here.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_01
 So yeah, somebody about something about the design of the buttons there?

0:06:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's not a hard to draw on the whiteboard, but they're supposed to be equal sized round with a little logo on it for the volume, the triangle and stuff.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_04
 Just for recognition.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and we don't need a letter or some remote controls.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_04
 Because we use the little display, we don't have to use it.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_00
 So for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_00
 We have a different color than the case, so they jump out.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_01
 Because we only have 30 minutes left, I will move on to the finance part, which is pretty exciting to see if it's all possible what we want to do.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_01
 And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for 12.5 euros.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if I'm building correctly, so just correct me if you see something wrong.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_01
 I counted two batteries, but maybe we can also use one.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if it's possible.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_01
 It's rechargeable.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, let's do euros.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_01
 We need the advanced chip, so there's not much to save there.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_01
 Here we have the single curve.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_01
 We can see that the difference between end curves and the single curve is 1 euro.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know, but I think the single curve is good for the design and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_01
 I think we have to keep that.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_01
 Then we have the case material supplements.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_01
 It's plastic. It's the cheapest one we need.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_01
 So that's not much to save either.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_01
 But then the biggest cost are the buttons. So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our cost though.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_01
 Because we will have to get 12.5 euros at the end.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_01
 So let's first count the buttons we have now.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_01
 That will be even more than 18 euros.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_01
 17.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, including the help.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_01
 I think we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long or pressing down a number.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_01
 That saves us 1 euro already.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_01
 Then we have got 15, I think.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_02
 I assume you count the volume and channel for two buttons each.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_01
 Those are one.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_04
 I think actually there are two buttons.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_04
 It's just one better.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_04
 Two for one big bell.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_04
 But they are more expensive than the small ones.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but it's not stated in this.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe we can make one button with the volume in the channel in one by pressing.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I think maybe you can just integrate three of those numbers to one button.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_02
 That's the possibility as well.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_01
 So it's good for the design as well.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_01
 It looks a bit like a cross.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_04
 I think they count the materials.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_04
 It's not a better one itself, but on the chip there.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_01
 But I think because we have the advanced chip, we can just count this as one button.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_02
 But now that I think this really is for buttons.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it is, but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get 12 and a half euros.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_01
 Also the LC display.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's too expensive for the display we use.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_00
 If we leave out the display, we can also save money on the chip.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_01
 But what's the biggest foundation of our remote then?

0:12:24	SPEAKER_02
 Only the docking station, I guess.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_00
 But the docking station isn't even in this schematic.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's not even taken into the price.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_01
 That's extra.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we should move to a different supplier.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_01
 That's an option.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_01
 Poland, something.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_01
 Polish player.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_01
 If we can count this as one button and integrate these buttons in three, then we save a lot of money as well.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_00
 We could save money on it, but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people?

0:13:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_00
 My mother can't even send a nasa-mess message.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_04
 That's a point.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_04
 We can't buy a remote control when you can use it.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_04
 We must stay below 1250.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_02
 Well, since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier, more easy, maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_02
 Especially since we have those nice features.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but we have to stick to the 1250.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_01
 We don't have any more budget to the market.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_01
 It's a little bit too small.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_04
 It's possible to make one for 1250.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think so.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_01
 If you leave out the LCD display and if you use less buttons, say...

0:14:25	SPEAKER_01
 You can do it with a single chip.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_04
 You want to make a bit than fancy and good looking.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_04
 With an effective option.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_04
 You can stay below 1250.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's difficult as well.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_02
 We can actually be a choice between either a good remote and a higher production cost or just any other remote control.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_01
 Or we can leave out the 10 buttons and take one scroll wheel for the program numbers.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_01
 Then we save 10 buttons and we have 5 and 1.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_01
 Let's see if we have this one and we've got the advanced.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_00
 We're getting closer.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_00
 We can't get closer.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_02
 How would a scroll wheel work here?

0:15:43	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can scroll.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_01
 If you scroll, you will see the numbers on the LCD display until you've got the right number and you push it.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_02
 That would bring up the price of the scroll wheel also.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, but then you can push some other buttons as well.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_00
 You could just not scroll for half a second.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_00
 That's right.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_01
 If you scroll to a number and you wait a half second, then it turns to that channel.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_02
 I think that would be the end of our usability.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_01
 It would definitely drop costs.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_01
 We need the battery.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_01
 The regular chip is not possible.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_00
 It has to be advanced.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_00
 If you want to use an LCD screen, you need an advanced chip.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_01
 Then we can save a Euro by a flat design.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_01
 That's an option we can...

0:17:03	SPEAKER_01
 Then we're almost there.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_00
 If you could just leave out one more button.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_04
 Or we have to skip the subtitle button.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_01
 That is a big advantage for us.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_01
 Can we integrate the text and the subtitles in one button?

0:17:30	SPEAKER_01
 If you push it...

0:17:31	SPEAKER_02
 Three titles.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_02
 Right now you just push the text button.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_02
 Go to page 888.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_02
 And the text disappears, but the subtitles stay there.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_04
 But if you push it, it's a bit too wide.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_00
 What if you have to scroll to page 888?

0:17:49	SPEAKER_02
 That could be just scroll to 8.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_02
 But then again, that would be just a pretty much an option for all their people.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_02
 Don't even know what a scroll wheel is.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_02
 Holding a remote with today's spec to have like ten buttons for the numbers 1 to 0.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_02
 There are only five buttons on it.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_02
 And a scroll wheel.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_01
 I think if you make good advertisement on television and in the guide, you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_01
 You just make it real simple.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_01
 It saves a lot of money and we can keep our LCD screen, which can provide extra information how to use the scroll wheel, how to use the other buttons as subtitles.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_01
 And it's good for the innovative design as well.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_01
 If you would erase these...

0:19:03	SPEAKER_01
 You're razor.

0:19:10	None
 Hey, we could put...

0:19:17	SPEAKER_01
 Looks a bit odd, maybe.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_02
 That's a pretty big scroll wheel.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_03
 Something like that.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_01
 Then we've got the scroll wheel.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_01
 If we erase this one...

0:20:08	SPEAKER_01
 These are two buttons then.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_00
 We could wake two buttons out of that.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_00
 If you press the volume button, you can control the volume with the scroll wheel.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_00
 So that would save two buttons if you do the same for the channel.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_01
 That's really a good idea.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_01
 And that will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_01
 So we make one for the volume, one for the channel.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_01
 Please scroll.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_01
 So if we...

0:21:14	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_01
 So we've got one, two, three.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we can leave the text in if we want.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_00
 That's me so it's better.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_00
 If we leave out all those buttons perhaps you can go with the flat case and make it smaller overall.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_00
 So if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button, the screen right under that then the scroll button.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_00
 You get a much smaller remote.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_01
 So we can decrease this one to four buttons.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_02
 Right now we have five buttons.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_04
 You can make quite a big remote control for just the same price as a small one.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_04
 You have to pay for the double curved or single curved.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_01
 So it's more the moles in which they are being made I think.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_01
 Single curved is really easy to just fill in and cases come right out of the machine.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_01
 Single curved you have to have a different machine than a flat one.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_01
 I think this is a really easy one.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_01
 But does everybody think about the flat or single curved design?

0:22:43	SPEAKER_02
 Well I still think we should go for the single curved design.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_00
 Richard argument was very good.

0:22:52	None
 Yeah.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_02
 We have to cut costs.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to just go to the board and ask for more money.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_01
 But I think we can then keep the single curved one just to express our LCD screen a bit more.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_01
 So people will use it more and especially for the help functions.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_01
 It will be good if we have scroll bar scroll button.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_01
 It will be necessary to have a good help function as well.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry this is scroll.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_01
 I think it was better to have this price this bit earlier before we went on to the whole design.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_01
 But I'm glad we could make a bit.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_01
 That's pretty different.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_01
 So all the last one.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_02
 And this one.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_02
 This is not really like for the group we were making or remote.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_02
 This will really require a lot of marketing.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_02
 And to get this to sell.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_02
 Because if other people like familiar forms and familiar stuff, this is not familiar for them.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_02
 No, but I think we have to do a lot of convincing them.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_04
 I think the most.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_04
 But they know the scroll buttons from old radio.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_04
 They also buttons like that for changing.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_01
 We can let it.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_01
 We can stick it out.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_01
 Like old buttons.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe that's recognizable for them as well.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_01
 That's a good one.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm afraid we have to move on.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_01
 And it's less frightening I think if they see this design they think there are only five buttons.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_01
 But we will see.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_02
 But it might be confusing too.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_02
 But it's very special.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_04
 So I would buy.

0:25:23	None
 Yeah, but you're not 60.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_01
 I would buy if I was 60.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_01
 No, I didn't know.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_01
 Articus and 12 and all of you rose?

0:25:32	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, they are.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_01
 No, but we can go on with the project evaluation.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_01
 Let's see.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_01
 I can sit down I think we still have 15 minutes left so nice on schedule.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_01
 The project process.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_02
 So I like set up all these criteria.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_02
 A valuation criteria.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_01
 That was the thingy.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_01
 The point I forgot.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_01
 Shoot.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_01
 There we are.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_01
 If the evaluation could do you.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_01
 Go ahead.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_01
 We've got five minutes I think.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_01
 Five more minutes.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_01
 No, we've got 15 minutes.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_01
 But okay.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so I did some literature study.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_02
 Analysis of the requirements we set up earlier.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_02
 Translated it into criteria.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_02
 Which would be these.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_02
 Is the remote fancy?

0:26:55	SPEAKER_02
 The shape looking few?

0:26:57	SPEAKER_02
 Inovative.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_02
 What new functions are there?

0:27:00	SPEAKER_02
 Easy to use.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_02
 Learnability is a very important factor here.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_02
 Is it functional?

0:27:09	SPEAKER_02
 Are there not too many functions?

0:27:11	SPEAKER_02
 A amount of functions and are those functions that are there?

0:27:14	SPEAKER_02
 Are they useful?

0:27:17	SPEAKER_02
 And the cost.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_02
 The target group is the remote really for the group we're making it for.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_02
 And great cognitive ability.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_02
 If our company is if it is easily recognizable, there are company made it.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_02
 So we're supposed to be evaluated right now.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_02
 Let's see.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I have to say this was a little hard because the minutes over the last meeting.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_02
 We're not here.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's because my pen failed to upload his data.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_01
 I tried to, but it's giving errors.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_01
 It's giving errors by downloading software.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_02
 Is the design fancy on a scale of 1 to 7?

0:28:10	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's fancy.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_04
 Six.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_04
 You'll go for six.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_02
 Good.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_02
 Is the design inovative?

0:28:24	SPEAKER_02
 Very.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_01
 I'll see these same titles.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_01
 Seven.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_01
 Seven?

0:28:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_02
 So we've got 20 cents for our docking station.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_02
 Should we do all?

0:28:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_01
 Is the design easy to use?

0:28:44	SPEAKER_01
 That's a bit...

0:28:46	None
土y.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_02
 Well, would be for us, but...

0:28:50	SPEAKER_01
 I would say four.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_01
 Four or five.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_01
 Four or five.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_01
 I'd go for four or two.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_01
 Is it functional?

0:29:01	SPEAKER_02
 Is the design functional?

0:29:03	SPEAKER_02
 Do we have all functions that we want to include?

0:29:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_02
 I think we do.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_02
 Do we have too many functions?

0:29:10	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_02
 No, I don't think so.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_01
 It's pretty slow.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's seven.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_02
 Seven?

0:29:18	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, and do we...

0:29:21	SPEAKER_02
 Take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control, like it getting lost, and...

0:29:29	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry, I haven't thought of that one.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_01
 Of course.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_01
 I think we do.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_01
 I had them worked out.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_01
 They're ugly, not very functional, and getting lost.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_02
 But the production costs within the preset limits?

0:29:47	SPEAKER_02
 Well, they are now.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_02
 Does the design fit the group of focus?

0:29:58	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's a free.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_01
 No, I think with a new radio button, I think it's better.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_04
 We have the test.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, no.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_00
 I still...

0:30:10	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's too fancy to flash...

0:30:15	SPEAKER_02
 Radio button is not exactly what older people expect of remote control.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, true.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_01
 How we give it a four?

0:30:29	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_02
 I think I'd go for two.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_02
 I'd go for three.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_03
 That way I'll have to do it three.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_03
 It's good.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_02
 Is the company recognizable?

0:30:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, it is.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_02
 It's the logo there.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:30:52	SPEAKER_01
 And they want to put fashion in their products in the slogan of the company.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_01
 We have the removable front cases.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_01
 So I think it's very recognizable.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_02
 There will be this.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_02
 I was also supposed to calculate the score, but...

0:31:18	SPEAKER_02
 Thought we would have another private...

0:31:21	SPEAKER_02
 We've got a calculator after this.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_00
 20.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_01
 Like after this are we done?

0:31:28	SPEAKER_01
 We've got the...

0:31:30	SPEAKER_02
 We've evaluated.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_02
 Well, anyhow, these are seven factors.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_02
 Time seven is 40.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_02
 Something, two.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_02
 Nine.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_01
 Nine.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_01
 Nine.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_02
 Nine is 49.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_02
 Minus one.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_02
 Minus three.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_02
 Minus four.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_02
 Minus four.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_02
 Minus eight.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_02
 41.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_02
 41.

0:31:58	None
 Out of 49.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_01
 That's...

0:32:05	SPEAKER_03
 All right, 80%.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_02
 I guess we'll just touch the name on the bottom here.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_01
 Does 84%.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's a pretty nice score.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_02
 So that will be the evaluation.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_01
 So that brings us to the project evaluation.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_01
 Project process.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_01
 Did we move through the right faces, you think, along the process?

0:33:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should have had the finance thing a lot earlier.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_02
 In the design phase.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_01
 So lack of information about prices.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_01
 So this section was there room for creativity?

0:33:33	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_01
 Not too much now.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_02
 It's because of the finance.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_01
 There was no room but the finance.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_00
 The room was...

0:33:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_02
 And I would have liked to go for the...

0:33:50	SPEAKER_02
 younger users also.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_02
 And just to be able to access internet and...

0:33:57	SPEAKER_02
 get something of your own.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_02
 Strictions.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_01
 Internet access.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_01
 Leadership.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_01
 Was it clear what everybody had to do?

0:34:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_01
 According to their roles and functions.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_04
 Teamwork.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_01
 Did it work out?

0:34:26	SPEAKER_01
 Working together.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_01
 Also, you two with...

0:34:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it was okay.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_01
 Last phase.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_01
 Nice.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_00
 The tasks are very strictured so you can just do step by step.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_00
 It was very easy.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_01
 Searched tasks.

0:34:50	None
 Okay.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_01
 Were there means sufficient for the tasks that we had to do?

0:34:56	SPEAKER_01
 Or were there too much?

0:34:59	SPEAKER_00
 Well, the smart board...

0:35:01	SPEAKER_00
 The drawing is just a pain in the ass but...

0:35:05	SPEAKER_00
 Smartboard...

0:35:06	SPEAKER_00
 The digital pen is very nice.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_01
 If it wants to download this data.

0:35:13	None
 Smartboard was...

0:35:16	SPEAKER_03
 You're dating.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_01
 So you brought in one of the flip over or...

0:35:37	SPEAKER_00
 Flip over or a more precise...

0:35:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_03
 Fosters as well.

0:35:45	None
 Yeah.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_01
 Flip over.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_04
 But if you want to share...

0:35:52	SPEAKER_04
 When you make a picture like this on the presentation.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_04
 It's easier to share it with other people.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_04
 So you can save it and put it on the internet or...

0:36:08	SPEAKER_04
 In the shared folder or...

0:36:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I tried to open the file.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_02
 It's on my laptop but it didn't work.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_01
 You need the smartboard application I think.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_01
 But I think you can...

0:36:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_01
 Should be possible.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you can export this image.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_01
 Best.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, best be.

0:36:31	None
 You should have done that.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_01
 So the sharing of the information was okay.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_01
 That's it.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's it.

0:36:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'm here on the table.

0:36:44	None
 Yeah.

0:36:45	None
 Yeah.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:36:49	None
 Yeah.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_04
 JPEG, VMP.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_01
 It's possible.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_01
 That's nice.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_01
 We found new IDs for...

0:37:02	SPEAKER_01
 I think this kind of meeting.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, maybe...

0:37:11	SPEAKER_04
 When we just gave the numbers of...

0:37:18	SPEAKER_04
 Of...

0:37:19	SPEAKER_04
 Of...

0:37:20	SPEAKER_04
 Of...

0:37:21	SPEAKER_04
 Of...

0:37:22	SPEAKER_04
 Of...

0:37:23	SPEAKER_04
 Of...

0:37:24	None
 Of...

0:37:24	SPEAKER_04
 Of...

0:37:25	SPEAKER_04
 Of...

0:37:26	SPEAKER_04
 Of...

0:37:27	SPEAKER_04
 Of...

0:37:28	SPEAKER_04
 Of...

0:37:29	SPEAKER_04
 Of...

0:37:30	SPEAKER_04
 Of...

0:37:31	SPEAKER_04
 Of...

0:37:32	SPEAKER_04
 Of...

0:37:33	SPEAKER_04
 So...

0:37:34	SPEAKER_04
 So...

0:37:35	SPEAKER_04
 So...

0:37:36	SPEAKER_01
 So everybody puts his own score.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:39	SPEAKER_01
 And then...

0:37:40	SPEAKER_01
 It mediates the score.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_01
 And you can get one...

0:37:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_01
 That's better.

0:37:45	SPEAKER_01
 So it's...

0:37:48	SPEAKER_01
 How do we call it?

0:37:58	SPEAKER_01
 Inevaluation.

0:38:01	SPEAKER_01
 Inevaluation.

0:38:02	None
 Inevaluation.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_01
 Criteria.

0:38:05	None
 Criteria.

0:38:07	None
 Criteria.

0:38:08	None
 Criteria.

0:38:10	None
 Criteria.

0:38:12	None
 Criteria.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_01
 Any more IDs?

0:38:18	SPEAKER_01
 Or questions about the project or...

0:38:20	SPEAKER_01
 About the product?

0:38:22	SPEAKER_01
 It goes...

0:38:29	SPEAKER_01
 I think...

0:38:34	SPEAKER_01
 Then that we...

0:38:36	SPEAKER_01
 Get to our last week.

0:38:40	SPEAKER_01
 Articles within the budget?

0:38:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_00
 Considering we are not going to make a docking station.

0:38:50	SPEAKER_01
 That's good.

0:38:52	SPEAKER_01
 But maybe because of the docking station, the...

0:38:56	SPEAKER_01
 Price of the remote can also be a little bit higher.

0:38:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:39:01	SPEAKER_01
 And I think you can compensate that as well.

0:39:05	SPEAKER_01
 So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem because it's very cheap to make as well.

0:39:10	SPEAKER_01
 Do we think we're going to get the 12.5 million?

0:39:15	SPEAKER_01
 What was it?

0:39:16	SPEAKER_01
 15 million.

0:39:17	SPEAKER_01
 15 million.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_01
 I think we will.

0:39:21	SPEAKER_01
 If you're going to export this product, it's innovative.

0:39:25	SPEAKER_01
 Especially in America.

0:39:27	SPEAKER_01
 People are pretty.

0:39:29	SPEAKER_01
 Take a dent.

0:39:31	SPEAKER_01
 Sometimes.

0:39:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, still don't think...

0:39:33	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, if we're going to make a scroll button anyway.

0:39:37	SPEAKER_02
 You can do more.

0:39:38	SPEAKER_02
 You can do more for the younger people and for the older people.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe we should just refocus.

0:39:44	SPEAKER_01
 Just put it on the market for everybody.

0:39:47	SPEAKER_01
 You can...

0:39:48	SPEAKER_01
 Specifically for...

0:39:49	SPEAKER_01
 You can change markets by changing the front cover.

0:39:53	SPEAKER_01
 That's one thing you can change it with.

0:39:56	SPEAKER_01
 So you can also try to reach the younger people by putting fancy covers on the market.

0:40:04	SPEAKER_01
 Just as a test.

0:40:05	SPEAKER_01
 See how it works?

0:40:07	SPEAKER_01
 That's I think a good advantage.

0:40:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is.

0:40:16	SPEAKER_02
 Then it would be with older people.

0:40:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:40:20	SPEAKER_02
 Even if it were there covers.

0:40:25	SPEAKER_01
 Then I think we can have our little celebration right now.

0:40:29	SPEAKER_01
 That's it.

0:40:30	SPEAKER_01
 I think we still have to fill in one more questioner.

0:40:34	SPEAKER_01
 I think...

0:40:36	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:40:37	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't get a message from the...

0:40:42	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I think I have one.

0:40:46	SPEAKER_01
 Five more minutes.

0:40:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, let's guys.

0:40:51	SPEAKER_01
 Then we still have some questions.

0:40:54	SPEAKER_01
 If somebody has some questions they can ask them now.

0:40:57	SPEAKER_01
 We can put these in the project folder as well.

0:41:02	SPEAKER_01
 Let's get it.

0:41:11	SPEAKER_01
 Export is...

0:41:20	SPEAKER_01
 Picture I think?

0:41:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:41:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:41:29	SPEAKER_01
 Hmm.

0:41:37	SPEAKER_01
 This is another... that's work, I guess.

0:41:49	SPEAKER_01
 Is somebody see the project folder?

0:41:53	SPEAKER_01
 I don't.

0:42:00	SPEAKER_01
 My documents.

0:42:06	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe they will save it.

0:42:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:42:10	SPEAKER_01
 I'll just put it in my documents and...

0:42:13	SPEAKER_01
 That's okay.

0:42:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:42:26	SPEAKER_01
 I think I'm going to make our final presentation now.

0:42:31	SPEAKER_01
