0:00:30	None
 Hi.

0:00:31	None
 Hello.

0:00:32	None
 Hi, everyone.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_01
 So, I don't know if you always see the agenda for this meeting.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_01
 You know I haven't.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_01
 Here we go.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_01
 So, the goal for today is we have two goals.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_01
 First is to decide the movie for the next projection for our movie club.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_01
 As you know, so it's for the last Friday of this month of April.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_01
 As you probably remember, the movie already projected where Lawrence of Arabia and Apocalypse now in February and Amadeus from Milas Foreman in March.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_01
 So, the question that is open is are we going to select a movie from the 90s and which movie?

0:01:37	SPEAKER_01
 So, that's the first goal, decide for a movie to be projected.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_01
 And the second goal is to discuss for an advertising poster for our club because we noticed that last time not enough people came to the projection.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_01
 So, that's it.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_01
 Who wants to start?

0:02:03	SPEAKER_01
 So, I guess you all prepared some documents for the selection of the movie?

0:02:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_02
 So, who has what actually?

0:02:11	SPEAKER_04
 I've got a PowerPoint presentation.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_02
 What do you have, Mirak?

0:02:17	SPEAKER_03
 I have a PowerPoint presentation and it's about, there are some reviews of the, I think, like seven movies.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_02
 And I have a, well, just a piece of paper with some suggestions.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_02
 What about you, Denny?

0:02:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you have also a piece of paper with my Faroite movie.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so we start with the presentations maybe?

0:02:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_01
 Agnes, we can start with you.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_04
 It's not very long in any case.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, in your case.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_01
 I pass this one.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so what I was thinking is basically the previous movies that we had, which you've already mentioned in the agenda, Lawrence of Arabia, Paul Clips now and Amadeus were fairly historical, serious, dramatic, and also action-y movies, except for maybe Amadeus.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_04
 And this month I was thinking of selecting something that's more in the present time, still dramatic, but slightly less serious.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_04
 And what I'd propose is something of a thriller or a mystery.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_04
 And I know that a lot of people find mysteries, not really mysteries in the movies these days.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_04
 They kind of can predict what's going to happen.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_04
 But in the 90s, there were some movies that did have surprise endings and then people came out saying, okay, didn't see that coming.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_04
 So I thought we could maybe show one of those.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_04
 And even if people have already seen the movie, a lot of the times you go back and watch the movie again and you pick up on things that you didn't really notice the first time around or you see where the clues were and what led up to the end.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_04
 So that's more along the lines of what I was thinking.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_04
 And the two in particular that I would propose are, next slide please, the usual suspects and the sixth sense.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know if you've seen any of them.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_04
 The usual suspects was directed by Singer and written by Christopher Macquarie.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_04
 It has a fairly large cast, so I'm not going to read all of them, but the main characters are Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_04
 And it's basically about five criminals who get set up.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_04
 They're arrested. They're released from prison.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_04
 And they get together and plan a crime.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_04
 And basically the story is told through the views of one of the suspects.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_04
 The tagline is kind of neat. Five criminals, one lined up, no coincidence.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_04
 And you get told the story that these characters are being controlled by one sort of Uber villain.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_04
 And in the end you find out who the Uber villain was.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_04
 And I kind of like the quote from Rolling Stone magazine.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_01
 The usual suspects is the freshest funniest.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_01
 Which one was it again? The guy who was controlling? I don't remember. I've seen the movie twice.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_04
 Have you guys seen the movie?

0:05:07	SPEAKER_04
 No, I haven't seen it.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_04
 It's a bold guy.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_04
 You want me to give away the movie?

0:05:13	SPEAKER_04
 No, no.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_04
 That'll spoil it.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_04
 I'll tell you later.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_04
 But the quote from Rolling Stone is fairly accurate.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's one of the freshest funniest and scariest crime thrillers to come along since Pulp Fiction.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_04
 It is a sixth sense with the famous line, I See Dead People, which the little boy says.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_04
 It was written and directed by M. Knight, Shayamalan, and stars Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, and Tony Collette.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_04
 And again, it has a neat twist that you find out right at the end.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's a bit more commercial that one.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_04
 The first one.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, yeah, the sixth sense was very commercial.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_02
 So what is the second image on the slide?

0:05:56	SPEAKER_04
 It's the poster for the sixth sense, but unfortunately I couldn't find a clear, big enough one.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_02
 It has a strange format.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_02
 Horizontal.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's only part of it.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it goes all of the senses.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_04
 If you go to the next slide, there's slightly more detailed things about the movies.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_04
 So the usual suspects is 105 minutes long, so it's a decent length of time.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_04
 It has an R rating, so I don't remember what type of audience we had at the last shows, but it may not necessarily be suitable for kids.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_04
 R is sort of, if you're 18 and under, you have to have an adult with you.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_01
 It's mostly for violence.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_01
 It's restricted.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's restricted.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_04
 It got an 8.7 out of 10 on the Internet movie database.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_04
 It's a 16th in the top 250 movies and 4th in the top movies of the 90s.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_04
 It won a couple of Academy Awards, notably for Best Writing, so that's for the script and Best Actor for Kevin Spacey.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_01
 That's the way to...

0:07:04	SPEAKER_01
 I have the top 10 from the 90s, no, the top 50, and it's 4th.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, 4th in the top movies of the 90s.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, sorry, sorry.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_04
 16th in the top 250, I think, of all time.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, because your table is only the 90s.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, 90s, yeah.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_04
 So it won lots of awards.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_04
 It won Best Film for the British Film Association, or the British equivalent of the Academy Awards.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_04
 It was nominated for Best Foreign Film for the Cesar.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_03
 So plenty of awards, really.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_03
 Plenty of awards.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_03
 That's 16th.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_01
 Well, 250.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_01
 It's what all days...

0:07:39	SPEAKER_01
 I think of all time.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_04
 All the days, yeah.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_04
 So...

0:07:44	SPEAKER_04
 It's still good.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_01
 But those ratings are more like it's number of votes, no?

0:07:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's ratings by viewers.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_02
 No, actually, if you look at your tables, I think it's a sort of, well, average between number of votes.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_02
 And ratings.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_02
 And, yeah, the rating or the marks.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_02
 Because they're in your table, you have things that have very few votes, but still are ranked quite high.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, like my

0:08:10	SPEAKER_04
 24, which has only 4,000 votes. Yeah, and 44 as well.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_04
 But which has 740-something votes.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_03
 So it's definitely just the average of the rating.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_03
 And, okay, the number of the votes is there just for the information.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_03
 So that...

0:08:23	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it's just the...

0:08:24	SPEAKER_02
 Or just compensated a bit for the number of people.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know, actually.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_02
 Because if you have just 10 votes and...

0:08:30	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, then you have probably an odd in the database.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah, anyway, it has excellent votes.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_04
 Haven't seen it.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_04
 That's a good movie.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_04
 I highly recommend it.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_04
 And I wouldn't mind seeing it again, because I do know the ending, and I haven't been able to watch it again to see where the hints were.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_04
 That were scattered across the movie.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_04
 Because apparently there are hints as to who it is.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know, I remember.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:08:56	None
 Okay.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 Sure, there is one guy who is at the police station, and they ask him to tell the story.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_01
 He's one telling the story.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_04
 There's him and the guy in the burn unit.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_03
 What is the second movie?

0:09:09	SPEAKER_04
 The second movie is The Sixth Sense.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_04
 Again, it's fairly short.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_04
 It has an easier rating.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_04
 It's PG-13.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_04
 It's much less violent.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_04
 It got an 8.1 out of 10.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_04
 It's 101st in the top.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_04
 250.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_04
 And it's 19th on your list, I think.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_04
 If I'm not mistaken.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's 19th.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_04
 Got a fair number of votes, too.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_04
 96,000.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_04
 Again, it was nominated for a lot of different Academy Awards.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_04
 I didn't win any, but I got a lot of buzz, and a lot of people liked it.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_04
 Those are my two selections.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_04
 And as you can see, the plot is a boy who communicates with spirits.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know when their dad seeks the help of a dishearted child psychologist to figure out why he's seeing what he's seeing and what it means.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_01
 Both movies are quite similar in some way, because the last sentence is totally contradictory to the whole movie.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_02
 The last sentence from the movie?

0:10:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_02
 The last sentence from the movie.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_04
 It's only right at the end where you find it, really what's going on, and it makes you rethink everything that happened beforehand.

0:10:21	None
 Mm-hmm.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_04
 So, those would be my two suggestions.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_04
 They are slightly more commercial, or at least the six senses, than the other ones we've seen.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_02
 So these guys were actually nominated.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_02
 So the bottom part of your slide, actually, it says, yeah, so these are the best awards they had.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, they were nominated for a lot of different awards.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_04
 They didn't win too bad.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_04
 I guess I can't remember what the competition was about here, but...

0:10:48	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, the one's just one winner.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:10:50	SPEAKER_04
 Uh-huh.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_04
 They were nominated for a lot of them.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_04
 And...

0:10:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_00
 So I think that's it.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_04
 You have a last slide, or...

0:10:59	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:11:00	None
 That's it.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_03
 Now you can go to two more slides.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, what I have prepared is just a kind of review of six or seven movies, if you can go to this.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_03
 You sent your slides around, right?

0:11:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_03
 Basically seven movies, and it's a top movie based on the ranking and awards.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_03
 You see the names of the movies on the wall.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_03
 So we can perhaps go through all of them, and we can a little bit discuss.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_03
 So I didn't see all of them, actually.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_03
 So we should probably select one of these, because I think these are really good movies.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_03
 We will see.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_03
 So if you can go through...

0:11:46	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_03
 So this is the first movie.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_03
 And it's more like a drama.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_03
 It's very high ranked.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_03
 And actually you have a nice list, because we can even see the number of the votes.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_02
 One hundred people.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_00
 One hundred.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_00
 I think your table is very clear.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_03
 Four two thousand.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_03
 Finally, I found actually your table much better than my presentation, because perhaps here we can really see.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_03
 No, we don't have the plot of the...

0:12:12	SPEAKER_01
 We have the movie.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:14	None
 Okay.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, but maybe we can...

0:12:19	SPEAKER_01
 We'll see in this movie.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_01
 We'll see in this movie, because then perhaps...

0:12:22	SPEAKER_04
 No, I haven't heard a lot of good things about it.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_04
 I've heard it's a really powerful movie.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_02
 I think I have seen it, actually.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_02
 What is the name in French?

0:12:30	SPEAKER_02
 Because...

0:12:31	SPEAKER_02
 I have no idea.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_01
 Uh-huh.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_01
 It's in jail, right?

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_01
 It's in a jail.

0:12:38	None
 Yeah.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_01
 It's fine.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_01
 I don't remember what it is.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, your third slide has the plot.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_03
 It's this one.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_03
 It's the one that is on the wall.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_02
 This guy is jail.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_01
 Wow.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_03
 So, I...

0:12:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_03
 So, no one of us saw this movie.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_03
 So, in this case, perhaps it's a little bit dangerous to select that movie for the...

0:13:03	SPEAKER_03
 For the...

0:13:04	SPEAKER_03
 This place.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:13:06	SPEAKER_03
 Well, a chindereusist.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_03
 Who saw this?

0:13:08	SPEAKER_01
 Me.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_03
 I think this is really nice.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_03
 This one is really nice.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_03
 It's...

0:13:13	SPEAKER_03
 You know, all of you know the story.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_03
 Mm-hmm.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:13:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_03
 It's quite high-ranked.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think it's not a bad movie.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_03
 I'm thinking whether there was some good occasion.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_03
 Something would...

0:13:28	SPEAKER_03
 Has happened recently.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_03
 There was something like a celebration of the...

0:13:32	SPEAKER_03
 Fifty years after the war or something recently now.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_03
 Uh-huh.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_02
 I think there was a celebration of...

0:13:38	SPEAKER_02
 60 years from now.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_02
 60 years from the liberation of the camps.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_02
 It's a kind of 50 years.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_02
 Because they were liberated beginning for the Five.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:13:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's not bad.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_02
 And it's also, I think it's a good idea, at least from my point of view, it's coherent with the previous films.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_02
 Like history.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_00
 In major events.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if we want to keep this coherent or change radically.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_02
 It's a very emotional movie though.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's...

0:14:01	SPEAKER_01
 That's one thing to keep on playing.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think it's a drawback.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_01
 But then it's not representative of the 90s.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_01
 It's more a movie about the story of the era of the Andur by the Jewish during the Second World War.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but Emanteus isn't really representative of the 80s.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_04
 Well, of the 1780s.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, according to your thing, it's 90s war.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's...

0:14:23	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it's representative of the style of the 80s.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_02
 That's what I doubt.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_02
 That's...

0:14:32	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_03
 But even here I wouldn't say that this style is representative of the 90s, right?

0:14:39	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, hard.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, but anyway, I think it's a really good movie.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_03
 It's a good movie.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_03
 I like it when I saw it.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_03
 And...

0:14:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_01
 It's one of the candidates.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_01
 I definitely...

0:14:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_03
 Even Spielberg is really quite a good...

0:14:54	SPEAKER_03
 So I...

0:14:55	SPEAKER_03
 Director, so I would say we could think about it.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_03
 I would keep it as a candidate, at least.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_03
 That's...

0:15:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_01
 I would also suspect we want to say something again about it.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_01
 No, I think we can just skip this one.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, come.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_01
 It's coming third on your list.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:12	None
 Yeah.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_01
 It's fourth on Anya's and on my list.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_01
 It's okay.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_01
 You selected some movies, no?

0:15:19	SPEAKER_01
 You didn't take the six words.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_01
 What is the rating?

0:15:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's funny, actually.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_02
 Perhaps it's a chance.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_02
 Because on your slides, actually the ratings are 8.7 for both.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_02
 No, they have the same usual suspect and pulp fiction.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_02
 Both are at 8.7, but on Denise table...

0:15:36	SPEAKER_02
 They can update it.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_02
 This one is at 8.6.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_02
 It gets updated.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_02
 Who knows?

0:15:40	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe people voted for it, yeah.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_02
 I did it.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_02
 I did it on Wednesday.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_02
 And me on...

0:15:46	SPEAKER_02
 That was 100,000 votes.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_02
 It shouldn't change too much.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, given the number of votes, I wonder.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 But anyway, it may change, I think.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_03
 So it probably has changed.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:15:56	SPEAKER_03
 It became small popular.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_03
 No, Paul.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you are.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, Kaji.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_01
 Do we have something to add on this movie?

0:16:04	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_04
 Wait, how many of us saw Schindler's list?

0:16:09	SPEAKER_04
 Three of us?

0:16:10	SPEAKER_04
 Did you see it?

0:16:11	SPEAKER_04
 I'm just trying to keep track of how many of us have seen Schindler's list.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_03
 I saw it.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_02
 You have.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_02
 You haven't.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_02
 I've seen very few movies from the list.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_02
 About 10 out of the first few.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_01
 That's why you are in the movie club to see more movies.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, Paul fiction.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's again quite high ranked.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_03
 But from my perspective, everyone already saw it.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_03
 Who was interested in that movie?

0:16:37	SPEAKER_03
 He saw it.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_03
 Who is not interested in that movie?

0:16:40	SPEAKER_03
 He didn't see it and he wouldn't like to see it in our movie club.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we should just skip it out and leave it out.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_03
 I wouldn't think about this as a candidate.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_03
 Even if it's a good movie.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_01
 It's quite representative of the 90s I think.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_01
 And the structure of the movie is interesting.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_01
 I think the first scene is actually the same scene as the last scene.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_01
 There is a kind of loop in this movie.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_03
 I think there is plenty of loops actually.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_04
 I think also it's old enough that even if people saw it the first time around, they don't necessarily remember everything that happened.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_04
 Because I remember seeing it when it came out.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_04
 But I don't particularly remember.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_03
 I fully agree that you can see this movie three times perhaps.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_03
 Three times and for the fourth time you still discover something new.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_03
 But on the other hand, I have the impression it's really, you know, everyone saw it.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_03
 It's quite well known.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_02
 You've seen it?

0:17:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I've seen it.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_02
 I like it very much.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_02
 So we've also seen it.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_01
 And the soundtrack is gorgeous also.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_01
 No?

0:17:42	SPEAKER_01
 That's why?

0:17:43	SPEAKER_04
 The soundtrack.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_04
 I don't remember the soundtrack.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it's plenty of well-known songs.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_02
 You know, the twist.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_03
 So what do you think?

0:17:53	SPEAKER_03
 I wouldn't think about this as a candidate because it seems to me...

0:17:56	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I would keep it as a candidate.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_02
 But I don't know.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_02
 I think for the moment I guess most of these are candidates.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_02
 So we'll try to...

0:18:03	SPEAKER_01
 We voted the end or you won't...

0:18:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we should probably vote the...

0:18:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think that's something that none of us like.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_04
 We can just eliminate it.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_04
 But we might as well leave everything until we end.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going through it.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_03
 We could just eliminate.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so we are not going to eliminate this one.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_03
 Good for us.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't see it.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_03
 But you can read the comment from the users.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_03
 That's the last...

0:18:25	SPEAKER_03
 It's called Scorsese.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_03
 And it says simply a masterpiece.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_03
 And it's a Scorsese last really great movie.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, again a movie about on Mafiano.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's against your movie.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_01
 With Robert de Niro and two other guys.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_04
 Ray Liotta and...

0:18:42	SPEAKER_04
 I can't recognize them from the picture.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_03
 The picture is not very cool.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_04
 I think.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_01
 A job picture.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_01
 On the right.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, on the right.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_04
 And the guy on the left is Ray Liotta.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_02
 You recognize them or you can read the text on the images?

0:18:57	SPEAKER_02
 I recognize them.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_04
 I'm a movie buff.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_04
 I know way too much about movies and...

0:19:01	SPEAKER_01
 It's the exact same actors who played in another Mafian movie that I cannot...

0:19:06	SPEAKER_01
 Lisef Roshi.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_01
 It was the name in French.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_04
 What was it about?

0:19:11	SPEAKER_01
 About Mafia.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_01
 That's why I didn't go to see this one.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_01
 It seems to me they are all about the same subject and same...

0:19:24	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_03
 It's a movie from the one that you saw that you mentioned.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_03
 Probably.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, nobody seen it.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_02
 No, no.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_02
 Probably not.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_03
 Silence of the lamps.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_03
 Should I tell something more?

0:19:43	SPEAKER_03
 Good father of all trailers.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_03
 That's what it says on the...

0:19:47	SPEAKER_03
 What some user says.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, it's a little bit horror.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's quite...

0:19:54	SPEAKER_03
 A little bit.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_03
 It's definitely not for kids.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_03
 But if the kids are not visitors of our cinema, why not?

0:20:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_03
 One have to rethink when you are watching this movie you have to think and it's scary.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_03
 Why not?

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 So it's about a bi-cicopatic killer.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, man.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 What was it again?

0:20:21	SPEAKER_01
 The plot?

0:20:22	SPEAKER_03
 So the FBI agent is assigned to help find a missing woman and save her from a bi-cicopatic killer with the help of another killer.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_04
 So the other killer is Hannibal Lecter who...

0:20:37	SPEAKER_04
 Who is in prison.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_02
 He's in jail and he's really weak.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_02
 No, no.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_02
 He tries to decrypt the other killers.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_04
 He tries to help the FBI agent, but he plays head games with the FBI agent at the same time.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_02
 He's really nasty ones.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_02
 Or does he?

0:20:53	SPEAKER_02
 With her?

0:20:54	SPEAKER_04
 He manages to freak her out.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's basically the point.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_02
 So on the picture you can see Jodie Foster and Ha Ha.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_01
 The moth.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_01
 Who is playing the moth?

0:21:07	SPEAKER_01
 The moth.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_04
 The one who is in jail or the one who...

0:21:11	SPEAKER_02
 And the Hopkins.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_02
 The other one I don't remember.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know that.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_02
 You see him very often.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_02
 But he plays three of them.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_02
 But it's...

0:21:18	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to help Hopkins.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_02
 He replays it very good.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_03
 Very good team.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:21:22	SPEAKER_02
 But the plot is quite horrible.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, not the plot, but what the active killer wants to do is quite horrible.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_04
 I vaguely remember what it is.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_04
 How many of us have seen it?

0:21:38	SPEAKER_04
 I'm guessing you haven't seen it.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_04
 No, I've seen it actually twice, I think.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_02
 I've seen it.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_02
 I think I've seen it a second time on TV, but maybe not a few.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_03
 I've seen it, but I can't really remember exactly all the details.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_03
 I can't either because I saw it right when it came out.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_03
 It's probably a big, long time ago.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_03
 It's from 1991.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_03
 1991, yeah.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_03
 1991, yeah.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:21:57	SPEAKER_03
 And I saw it when I was like 12 or 13.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, me too.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_04
 And at that age it was like...

0:22:03	SPEAKER_00
 We're much too young.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_01
 American Beauty was coming next, 7.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_01
 It was quite nice.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_04
 That was very good, yeah.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_03
 It's actually there.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, it's here.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_03
 And it's actually my last slide.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:22:20	SPEAKER_03
 Why you choose 7 movie?

0:22:22	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know because it's nicely...

0:22:24	SPEAKER_03
 I was thinking perhaps we are not able to go through more of them.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_03
 So American Beauty, so I can perhaps read a little bit the user comment if you want.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_03
 Or you can read the plot outline on the projector, but it's basically deep, wonderful and penetrating movie.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_03
 Extra ordinary irony and the psychological drama about American life.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's definitely about American life.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, like...

0:22:50	SPEAKER_04
 Superb and life.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_01
 It's kind of crude, the critique, but on the other way it's quite pointy to things.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_01
 There's a lot of very true things in it.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, poetic.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you know, with the way of filming and...

0:23:04	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know, I don't know.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, the way of filming is that I would like to see it.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's quite interesting.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:23:13	SPEAKER_04
 It's much less dark than the other movies we have on that list.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_04
 So it's not very violent really.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_04
 It's not... well, it's dark.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_04
 I know, it's not violent at all.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, no.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 But more... it's more... the critique that is quite crude because all the people in this movie are...

0:23:30	SPEAKER_01
... are psychopath in their own way.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_01
 But not like violent cutting people.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_01
 But they are normal people.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_01
 That's scary.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_04
 Just everyone has their own issues.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_02
 And what about the... well, that's picture with the girl and do you see naked people in the movie or...?

0:23:46	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, there's...

0:23:47	SPEAKER_01
 Is it about sex?

0:23:49	SPEAKER_01
 It's a 50 years old man that quit his job and fall in love with the best friend of...

0:23:55	SPEAKER_01
 His daughter.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_01
 He's a daughter.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_04
 It's like teenage daughter.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_04
 So that's the best friend and he fantasizes about her and...

0:24:01	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_00
 It's... it's a good movie.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:24:06	None
 Okay.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_03
 And that's my last slide.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:24:11	SPEAKER_03
 You have seen it, me like?

0:24:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, yes, yes.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_03
 And I think, okay, why not?

0:24:15	SPEAKER_03
 It seems to me that perhaps a... okay, definitely Shindler's list is perhaps more serious topic, for sure.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_03
 But...

0:24:24	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it depends.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_03
 It depends what we want.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_03
 Do we want that people are more like a relaxed in our cinema or are more interested in some particular things?

0:24:33	SPEAKER_03
 What do you think?

0:24:35	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, what should we... how we should...

0:24:38	SPEAKER_03
 What should be the influence, how we are influencing the people in the cinema?

0:24:42	SPEAKER_03
 Mm-hmm.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_01
 I think we want them to see movies that they won't see otherwise, but I'm not sure then it's quite popular the movie we selected, so...

0:24:53	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think it's a mixture of bringing new things to them, but also making them enjoy the show so that they come to our movie club.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah, I think we shouldn't maybe do very mainstream movies, but well, okay, the list here is quite...

0:25:09	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know what was mainstream in Europe, like all of these movies are very mainstream for me.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think also if you look at the number of votes here...

0:25:17	SPEAKER_01
 These are quite mainstream, but...

0:25:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, regarding Denise Stable, I would say, given that this site... I don't know if it's mainly American, but I would say this...

0:25:28	SPEAKER_04
 And there are other movies, but I think it's predominantly...

0:25:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think...

0:25:31	SPEAKER_02
 I think there is...

0:25:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's English speaking anyway, so...

0:25:34	SPEAKER_02
 Do you have these movies, English movies?

0:25:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but if you look at...

0:25:39	SPEAKER_04
 There's movies from everywhere, but...

0:25:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but I would say mainstream are the ones that have more than 60,000 votes, and you can see some more...

0:25:49	SPEAKER_02
 confidential films that have like 10,000, 20,000...

0:25:54	SPEAKER_02
 Like Princess Mononoke, 20,000, and whatever, the Kislavski at 11,000, the Tracula...

0:26:03	SPEAKER_01
 It's quite a lot for Kielowski, actually.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's not bad at all, yeah.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah, anyway, if you want a definition of mainstream or whatever.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_01
 And Festerner also is quite I.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if you've seen this one.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_01
 It's the celebration, I think.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_01
 It's a movie from Swedish guy?

0:26:23	SPEAKER_01
 Danish, I think. It's the Dogma movie.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_01
 Dogma movie, yeah.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_01
 Lars von Preyer.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, okay.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, can we...

0:26:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, let's...

0:26:35	SPEAKER_01
 Disgusting about your document, maybe?

0:26:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_02
 So, it's...

0:26:38	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, I have made...

0:26:39	SPEAKER_01
 If I ask you for the...

0:26:40	SPEAKER_02
 I have made photocopies.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I have them, Denny.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_02
 So, it's all for you.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, I tried to propose just one movie with some alternates.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_02
 That's fine.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_02
 And the...

0:26:50	SPEAKER_03
 Denny, Denny, could you give me the list of the top 50?

0:26:53	SPEAKER_03
 Sure.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_03
 But do you have your own copy?

0:26:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, good. Thank you.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_02
 So, my proposal, which is only a proposal, would be to...

0:27:03	SPEAKER_02
 To keep the focus on more or less history and action.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_02
 So, Lawrence of Arabia was okay about this guy during the First World War.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_02
 So, it happens outside Europe and the States, but it's a piece of history.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_02
 Poco-leaps now, it's Vietnam, if I'm correct.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_02
 And, okay, I'm a dose that's much earlier, and it's not about...

0:27:29	SPEAKER_02
 It's not violent, which is a nice thing, I think.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_02
 But, given that we would like a movie from the 90s, I thought the saving private Ryan, oh, thanks for projecting the document, would keep this, more or less, this theme of history and war and action drama, while showing actually a very new, and I would say, humanistic view on war.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_02
 Because it's not like the sort of glorification of the good guys that go against the Nazis, but it's a... Well, the plot, actually, you don't know it.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_02
 It's about people looking for just one soldier, in fact.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_02
 It's about a family of four brothers, who actually three of them get killed during the war in these days of...

0:28:22	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I guess, summer 44.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_02
 And, well, the government decides that they need to get back the fourth brother just to save one member of the family, and this guy is private Ryan.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_02
 So the movie is not about killing the Germans or whatever, it's about saving at least one guy from a family.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_02
 So, but of course the setting is during the war, and it's very realistic and very traumatic, in fact.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_02
 It's not at all a glorification of war, but it's just... It shows a bit the violence of the things.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_02
 And especially the beginning is... I think it's great, it's very violent, but it's an image of war.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_01
 It's quite horrible, actually.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_01
 Very violent.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but I think, well, if you compare it...

0:29:13	SPEAKER_03
 I saw it, and I'm trying to remember the beginning, that's the normal...

0:29:16	SPEAKER_02
 The landing, yeah, it's the landing.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_02
 And actually, more or less, everyone gets killed.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_01
 It's a piece of art because he used something like 100 camera to film that.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I don't know, but yeah, actually it's very well filmed and it's very realistic.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_02
 And I don't know if you compare with... I don't know, in Lawrence of Arabia, I think they have some battles and camels.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_00
 I know it's very nice.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_02
 Someone falls somewhere there, and...

0:29:39	SPEAKER_02
 Well, you know, it's like battles that look nice, but this one doesn't look nice, and I think it's...

0:29:44	SPEAKER_02
 It's also maybe a representative of the 90s, you know, people starting to get a more realistic view of war.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_02
 But it's true, it's a bit violent.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_02
 And so what I put here, it's a bit long, too. It's nearly three hours.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_02
 But I don't know, apocalypse now is quite long, too.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it is.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_01
 There is two.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_01
 The art version, I think.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the redox version is longer.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we projected the longer ones.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_02
 So it won five Oscar prizes, best director for Steven Spielberg, best cinema cinematography, etc.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_01
 How many times Spielberg received the best director?

0:30:25	SPEAKER_01
 I think just one for this.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_01
 Not for the Schindler list or for...

0:30:30	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, maybe he did.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_01
 For E.T.?

0:30:32	SPEAKER_04
 No, for E.T. he didn't.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_04
 He won't...

0:30:34	SPEAKER_04
 It wasn't until he started doing things like Schindler's list and saving Private Ryan that he actually started winning awards.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_04
 No, he won't.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_01
 He won't.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_01
 Can...

0:30:43	SPEAKER_01
 What is...

0:30:44	SPEAKER_01
 Palmodo.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_00
 Mm-hmm.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_00
 Go ahead.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so, yeah, that's the point.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's a bit gray.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_02
 And actually, if you look at my second page, in the trivia, I found out that, in fact, they actually reduced the color saturation of the movie, just to make it look maybe a bit like the documentary.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_01
 That was very interesting to read the time.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it was very surprised to find this.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_01
 But then they read that they...

0:31:13	SPEAKER_01
 They turned back the color.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_03
 They re-engineed the color.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_03
 Because people start to complain that...

0:31:18	SPEAKER_03
 That is their TV is a lie.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_03
 That was a problem with the TV when they were broadcasting the movie on the TV.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so this fact number two, I think, obviously, for me.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_02
 Technical piece of my house.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_02
 It's an interesting point.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_02
 It's quite funny.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_02
 It's quite funny.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_02
 So, I mean, these four points could serve also as an introduction, if you want to talk for five or ten minutes before the movie.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know, in the room.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah, this would be my candidate, but I'm very much interested.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_01
 And then there is a hero.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it's a non-hero.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_01
 And in all the other stories in the previous movies, there were a hero, Lawrence of Abya, Amadeus.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_01
 A book that is now also a non-hero, I think.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_01
 But, yeah, I don't remember.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_01
 It's actually the...

0:32:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, on the picture, actually.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's dumbhangs.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_02
 In fact, you don't see Private Ryan until the end, more or less.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_02
 Or you see...

0:32:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but two birds in the way through the movie.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but the end, two countries.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_04
 Most of the movies, they're trying to find him on the front.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_01
 He's Private Ryan?

0:32:24	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_01
 No, he's trying to find him.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, he's trying to find him.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_02
 Well, the caption says Captain John Miller.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_02
 So, if you look at the caption...

0:32:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so the Private Ryan was Matt Damon.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so the Private is just a simple soldier, actually.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_03
 By the way, did he find Dye-Thingley or not?

0:32:46	SPEAKER_02
 Who, Private Ryan?

0:32:47	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, they find him, actually, and they send him back to the family.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_02
 But the Captain Dye is actually...

0:32:52	SPEAKER_04
 Is him at the beginning of the movie at the graveyard, right?

0:32:58	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah, but Private Ryan remembering that beginning.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_03
 With his family.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_03
 Because I remember that in the end of the movie, they are trying to defend some bridge or something and there's quite heavy shooting and finally it's actually John Miller who died.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, exactly.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_02
 He dies, unfortunately.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah, there is sacrifice.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_01
 At the end, to tell you the truth, I didn't like so much the movie because it was quite moralistic because there were a guy who didn't kill a German because he was quite non-violent and because he didn't kill this German, the German killed...

0:33:31	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know, maybe...

0:33:33	SPEAKER_03
 Perhaps it was this Tom Hanks, yeah.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_01
 And it was like, if he had killed...

0:33:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the German.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_03
 If he would kill him, he wouldn't know.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_03
 Because it...

0:33:45	SPEAKER_03
 Tom Hanks wouldn't die.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I mean, yeah, it has a moral dimension all over the movie, you know, saving the individual and the guys.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah, I don't know. I don't know how many people have seen it well among you, well, most of you actually.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, okay, all of us.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe people know it quite well.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we are running...

0:34:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay, so, yeah. So I have some other candidates.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_02
 It's on first page at the bottom.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_02
 I also put Pulp Fiction, the Silence of the Lambs, and also the, well, sort of included La Fita Ibella, but I know we're in English movie clubs, so I guess it's...

0:34:21	SPEAKER_02
 It's a bit out of purpose.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_02
 But it's...

0:34:24	SPEAKER_03
 But it's the movie about the La Fita Ibella.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, it's about, again, about the camps and the Second World War.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_02
 So it's about a family of Italians, which arrives into a death camp.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_02
 And in fact, it's treated in a more or less humorous mode.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_02
 So the father tries to hide from his boy that they are in a death camp.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_02
 And is this very strange...

0:34:48	SPEAKER_02
 Well, not really humor, but relation between the...

0:34:51	SPEAKER_02
 How would end up...

0:34:52	SPEAKER_02
 How is the...

0:34:53	SPEAKER_02
 What is the...

0:34:54	SPEAKER_02
 Well, the boy gets saved, but the father dies.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_02
 So... I don't know.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_02
 It created some controversies, I think, because people said you shouldn't do any form of humor related to the camps, but it's very, very moving, so I think it's...

0:35:08	SPEAKER_02
 Anyway, Italians.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_03
 There's actually a third movie about the Second World War.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_03
 Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, and...

0:35:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:18	None
 Yeah.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_01
 Danny?

0:35:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so I have a quite different movie to propose you.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_01
 It's called The Big Lebowski from Joel Cohen.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_01
 Actually, they are browsers.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_01
 You probably know them.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know how many of you have seen this movie.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_02
 I haven't just partially seen it, but I heard it's very funny.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_02
 I've seen some other films by the Cohen brothers.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, they made Fargo.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_02
 Which is in your table.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_02
 And the last one was the one with Catrin at that chance.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_01
 Crow.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_01
 Crow.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_01
 Crow.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_01
 Crow.

0:35:58	SPEAKER_01
 Crow.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_01
 In tensions or something like that, I think.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, something about Crow.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so...

0:36:02	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know how I'm going to sell you this movie, because actually the plot is impossible to make, because it's actually inspired from a movie called The Big Sleep, and...

0:36:16	SPEAKER_01
 A movie or a novel?

0:36:18	SPEAKER_01
 It's actually...

0:36:20	SPEAKER_01
 Where I've seen that?

0:36:22	SPEAKER_01
 It's a movie from Raymond Schundler, The Big Sleep.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_02
 No, but they say that Raymond Chandler wrote the novel.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_02
 You see, it's the last but one paragraph on your screen.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_01
 So it's a novel, okay.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_01
 But then the story goes that while that film was in production, and director, oh, okay, okay, you are right.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_01
 For the book.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so it's about a guy called the Dude.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know how you pronounce it.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_01
 And it's actually smoking pots and doing nothing.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_01
 Just...

0:37:01	SPEAKER_01
 He's living in LA.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_01
 It's a typical fellow from the suburb.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_01
 And he has some friends, typical friends.

0:37:12	SPEAKER_01
 He is an old guy coming back from Vietnam, obsessed by Vietnam.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_01
 Another guy who is never speaking, and they all pay together a bullying.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_01
 And the casting is very interesting.

0:37:29	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, actually I wanted to propose you some posters related to this movie.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it's going to open the discussion on posters as well.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_01
 So, actually here on this, the first poster you can see the actors from the movie.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if you know some of them.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_01
 So Jeff Bridges at the top, Goodman is the second one, the big guy.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_01
 Then Turtaro.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_01
 And the last one is Buchini.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_01
 And I don't remember the name of the girl.

0:38:02	SPEAKER_01
 It's Julian Moore's name.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, Julian Moore.

0:38:05	SPEAKER_02
 You wrote the paragraph on the poster?

0:38:08	SPEAKER_01
 I took it from... I don't know where.

0:38:11	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_02
 Could she edit it a bit?

0:38:15	SPEAKER_01
 Actually, I'm not going to describe much more the big Lebowski, but it's quite hard to describe.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_01
 It's a journey about this guy, but it's a movie quite surrealistic.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, there are some parts that are coming from dreams.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_03
 Why the movie is called the big Lebowski? Why the big?

0:38:34	SPEAKER_03
 Lebowski is his family name, right?

0:38:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's his family name and actually Jeff Ray Lebowski.

0:38:41	SPEAKER_01
 And there is a story with another Lebowski.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, two Lebowski's in there.

0:38:47	SPEAKER_03
 And why the big Lebowski? It's the second one.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_01
 I don't remember.

0:38:52	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it's just because of the big slip.

0:38:56	SPEAKER_01
 I don't be a reference.

0:38:59	SPEAKER_01
 A reference.

0:39:00	SPEAKER_01
 So it's like American beauty in some way.

0:39:03	SPEAKER_01
 It's even worse. We see worse people.

0:39:07	SPEAKER_01
 So it's kind of an ethnographic movie, I would say.

0:39:10	SPEAKER_01
 And it's a modern era. It's quite fun.

0:39:14	SPEAKER_01
 And the casting is marvelous.

0:39:16	SPEAKER_01
 So that's it for this movie.

0:39:19	SPEAKER_01
 And I just wanted to go to the design of the poster, actually.

0:39:24	SPEAKER_01
 I kind of like that.

0:39:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:39:27	SPEAKER_02
 It's probably a bit dark for a poster, but otherwise it's very nice.

0:39:31	SPEAKER_01
 The idea is also to discuss the content, should we put a summary of the movie or the plot and what kind of information do we want.

0:39:39	SPEAKER_01
 So that's the first poster.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_01
 There is also this poster.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_01
 Quite dark also.

0:39:48	SPEAKER_01
 So I don't know if you cannot really see, but there is the pricing information.

0:39:55	SPEAKER_01
 So we say that one movie is 8 francs and three movies, 18 francs.

0:40:01	SPEAKER_01
 And we can have an annual subscription of 60 francs.

0:40:06	SPEAKER_01
 I wanted to say some information to involve people in the committee as well, if they want to take part to the committee to select movies.

0:40:14	SPEAKER_01
 And what else?

0:40:18	SPEAKER_03
 This is not bad because it says something a little bit about our movie club.

0:40:26	SPEAKER_03
 And the big club of skates clear that it's a movie and I guess the people can remember that it was a movie at least, even if they haven't seen it.

0:40:32	SPEAKER_04
 Looks like a CD cover.

0:40:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, actually the idea was to, yeah, there is at the bottom a scene from one of these dreams of the big Lebowski.

0:40:42	SPEAKER_01
 And the first part is actually you see a cowboy and the hero, the Jeff Lebowski, the dude.

0:40:50	SPEAKER_01
 And the cowboy, actually at the beginning of the movie the cowboy introduced the story and he's coming back at the end of the story.

0:40:57	SPEAKER_01
 And he's explaining what kind of movie you are going to see.

0:41:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, sounds a bit crazy.

0:41:06	SPEAKER_01
 And last postures, same principle but I don't know, I was thinking of adding some quotations of well-known directors.

0:41:24	SPEAKER_02
 I like it because it's not so dark, so the images are a bit brighter.

0:41:29	SPEAKER_03
 I actually don't like it.

0:41:37	SPEAKER_04
 Although I think you can mix, I would keep the format of the first one, add the quotes and the content information from the second one.

0:41:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that would be the best one.

0:41:47	SPEAKER_04
 So take those quotes, get rid of that section of text, put those quotes in there, put the information you had in the second poster about the movie club.

0:41:58	SPEAKER_04
 How to join, kind of in the middle and keep this title and everything just slightly higher up.

0:42:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, I see.

0:42:06	SPEAKER_02
 What about a brighter background? Because this one, I don't know how it would show on a wall or something like this.

0:42:13	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't really catch your attention.

0:42:16	SPEAKER_04
 I think it does.

0:42:17	SPEAKER_04
 I think the contrast between the strip of film or the strip of pictures and everything else is...

0:42:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, I see. What I wanted is more or less to know the content of the movie, what you want to have on the poster.

0:42:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, because we did...

0:42:35	SPEAKER_01
 Because the poster was very good on the second one.

0:42:37	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, on that one.

0:42:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so take all of that.

0:42:41	SPEAKER_04
 All this information.

0:42:42	SPEAKER_04
 Throw it up into the first one and then maybe add the quotes that you had from the famous directors, sort of at the bottom.

0:42:50	SPEAKER_04
 Or just one of them.

0:42:51	SPEAKER_01
 If they fit there.

0:42:52	SPEAKER_01
 If they fit there.

0:42:53	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, great.

0:42:55	SPEAKER_01
 So I think now we have to decide for a movie.

0:42:58	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:43:01	SPEAKER_02
 So I would suggest...

0:43:06	SPEAKER_02
 Some big love of skis.

0:43:07	SPEAKER_02
 If it's not too long.

0:43:08	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe each of us could nominate one or two movies.

0:43:11	SPEAKER_02
 We make a list and then we vote.

0:43:13	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, good idea.

0:43:14	SPEAKER_02
 What do you think?

0:43:16	SPEAKER_02
 So, what's...

0:43:17	SPEAKER_02
 So, Mirac, what do you nominate?

0:43:19	SPEAKER_03
 So, I'm really convinced by the big love of skis.

0:43:23	SPEAKER_03
 You are?

0:43:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, yeah.

0:43:25	SPEAKER_03
 I would like to, at least to have it in the...

0:43:28	SPEAKER_03
 In the nominees.

0:43:29	SPEAKER_02
 In the nominees.

0:43:30	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:43:31	SPEAKER_03
 Another nominee.

0:43:32	SPEAKER_03
 And...

0:43:33	SPEAKER_03
 The usual suspects.

0:43:34	SPEAKER_02
 I remember all of them.

0:43:35	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, Agnes, usual suspects.

0:43:36	SPEAKER_04
 Mainly because only two of us have seen it.

0:43:39	SPEAKER_04
 And it's not a mainstream movie.

0:43:41	SPEAKER_04
 So I don't think a lot of people would have seen it to begin with.

0:43:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:43:45	SPEAKER_02
 You can nominate one or two.

0:43:47	SPEAKER_02
 So that we...

0:43:48	SPEAKER_00
 Or whatever.

0:43:49	SPEAKER_02
 I would nominate, well, okay, my candidate, saving private Ryan.

0:43:57	SPEAKER_02
 And I'm happy with your nominations too.

0:43:59	SPEAKER_02
 I would nominate also Pulp Fiction because it's a very good movie.

0:44:07	SPEAKER_02
 Dunny, so that yours is already nominated.

0:44:11	SPEAKER_01
 American Beauty as well.

0:44:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:44:14	SPEAKER_01
 And I would be okay with saving private Ryan.

0:44:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so it's already on the list.

0:44:26	SPEAKER_03
 And then I'm still hesitating between the Schindler's List and the Silence of the Lambs.

0:44:33	SPEAKER_03
 May I nominate all these three movies?

0:44:36	SPEAKER_03
 Big love of speech on the list and the Silence of the Lambs.

0:44:42	SPEAKER_02
 So we have seven candidates.

0:44:50	SPEAKER_02
 If you have a good short term memory, that should be okay.

0:44:53	SPEAKER_02
 So you're released by what, too?

0:44:55	SPEAKER_02
 So, Big Lebowski, usual suspects, saving private Ryan, Pulp Fiction, American Beauty, Schindler's List, and Silence of the Lambs.

0:45:03	SPEAKER_02
 So now let's vote.

0:45:05	SPEAKER_02
 Should we vote just for one film?

0:45:07	SPEAKER_02
 Or should each of us say...

0:45:09	SPEAKER_03
 So eliminate first?

0:45:10	SPEAKER_01
 One movie each and then we select.

0:45:13	SPEAKER_03
 I'm sorry, could you go to the list of the movies?

0:45:17	SPEAKER_03
 So, Big Lebowski.

0:45:18	SPEAKER_03
 Is it possible to put them on the whiteboard?

0:45:23	SPEAKER_02
 I can write on your paper, maybe.

0:45:25	SPEAKER_03
 The Schindler's List, usual suspects, Silence of the Lambs, Big Club of Ski, and Saving Private Ryan.

0:45:33	None
 Okay.

0:45:35	SPEAKER_03
 Saving Private Ryan.

0:45:38	SPEAKER_04
 So, I'm missing one. What am I missing? Top Fiction?

0:45:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, Top Fiction.

0:45:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. So each of us chooses one to eliminate.

0:45:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's a bit cruel, but...

0:45:49	SPEAKER_01
 That's a good way.

0:45:51	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:45:52	SPEAKER_01
 The name?

0:45:53	SPEAKER_01
 Me, I will remove Silence of the Lambs because I think it's too violent.

0:45:57	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. I will just remove it this way.

0:45:59	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. I would remove Schindler's List because it's too sad.

0:46:08	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:46:09	SPEAKER_02
 Well, not very good reason, but...

0:46:13	SPEAKER_04
 Top Fiction.

0:46:15	SPEAKER_03
 Well, too bad.

0:46:16	SPEAKER_03
 And I would turn it...

0:46:17	SPEAKER_03
 And you have the reason for it or...

0:46:18	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino.

0:46:20	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. And I would eliminate Top Fiction actually as well if so...

0:46:23	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can eliminate another one.

0:46:25	SPEAKER_01
 No, no.

0:46:26	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no.

0:46:29	SPEAKER_02
 It's gone.

0:46:30	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:46:31	SPEAKER_02
 So we're left with the Big Lebowski usual suspect saving Private Ryan and American Beauty.

0:46:37	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. So let's vote just simply for one for the moment.

0:46:41	SPEAKER_02
 So I would vote for American Beauty because I haven't seen it.

0:46:47	SPEAKER_03
 I voted for the Big Lebowski.

0:46:49	SPEAKER_04
 We're all gonna...

0:46:51	SPEAKER_04
 Something different.

0:46:53	SPEAKER_02
 So we're at the Big Lebowski.

0:46:56	SPEAKER_02
 Agnes, Denny.

0:46:57	SPEAKER_02
 Agnes, Denny.

0:46:58	SPEAKER_04
 I still like the usual suspects, but I like American Beauty too.

0:47:03	SPEAKER_04
 So...

0:47:05	SPEAKER_03
 Make a decision.

0:47:10	SPEAKER_04
 Usual suspects.

0:47:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:47:18	SPEAKER_01
 No, I have the...

0:47:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you can choose...

0:47:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:47:21	SPEAKER_01
 You're the president maybe after all, huh?

0:47:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:47:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so I'll go with the Big Lebowski since the poster is already ready.

0:47:27	SPEAKER_01
 Already ready, yeah.

0:47:29	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:47:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think I'm...

0:47:32	SPEAKER_02
 That's fine.

0:47:33	SPEAKER_04
 So...

0:47:34	SPEAKER_04
 It'll make a good change from...

0:47:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think at least it's funny and that's nice.

0:47:39	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:47:41	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:47:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:47:43	SPEAKER_03
 This is gonna be Big Lebowski.

0:47:45	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:47:47	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:47:48	SPEAKER_02
 That's your fault, Mirac.

0:47:50	SPEAKER_02
 You don't like it, it's your problem.

0:47:52	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, no, no.

0:47:53	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, no, no.

0:47:54	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, yeah, it's...

0:47:56	SPEAKER_01
 We have other monteys anyway.

0:47:58	SPEAKER_01
 I've never seen it.

0:47:59	SPEAKER_01
 So can we decide for a next meeting?

0:48:01	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe...

0:48:02	SPEAKER_02
 Well, beginning of May, I guess, to choose the film for May?

0:48:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:48:06	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:48:07	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:48:08	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, beginning of May, but there is plenty of holidays at the beginning of May now.

0:48:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the fifth is...

0:48:14	SPEAKER_02
 Asuncio.

0:48:15	SPEAKER_02
 What's that?

0:48:16	SPEAKER_02
 Asuncio.

0:48:17	SPEAKER_02
 Going up to the sky.

0:48:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, or we'll design after the projection of the movie to date.

0:48:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we can do it like the Tuesday before the ascension, so that's May 3rd.
