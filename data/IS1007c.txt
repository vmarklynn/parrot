0:00:30	SPEAKER_02
 So, we come to the third meeting, I hope the lunch was good.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_02
 So, in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think I will do my presentation on the components concept. So, can you please open the slide? I'm participant 2, couple of these design.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so the first thing I have done is to make a review together with the manufacturer department, which components were available to build remote control.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_03
 So, for energy sources we have to choose between the solar energy, hand-in-a-mo and kinetic, well, kinetic technique to store the energy.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_03
 We also can put regular battery in the remote control. This is what we have decided in the last meeting. But if we use battery.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, I meant by battery, I would not have a wire between the remote control and an energy source. But we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the remote.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's a point to discuss. Then the case material we have also several choices like hood, rubber, titanium or latex.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_03
 But it's not a really issue from the technical point of view. Concerning the interface, we can put just simple buttons or scrolls. Our buttons are much more complicated.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_03
 But it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated. So this is the last points, the choice of chips.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_03
 So, what I have found is that I think basic battery or kinetic energy collection is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy won't work in the accretal environment.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think we can start with these two main things. For the case, I think that a titanium is a good choice because it's trendy and it's a well, it's modern.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_03
 So, the user will be very happy to have a nice remote. For the interface, I think that we can achieve all the desired functionalities by just using rubber buttons, simple buttons.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_03
 And does this allow to use a regular chip? That's alright, well, cheaper.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_03
 So, we can move to the next slide. Sorry. What is a single curved? What does it mean?

0:05:13	SPEAKER_03
 The shape of the remote, you will have the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the...

0:05:25	SPEAKER_01
 When you hold on it, it's comfortable with the hole.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_03
 It's more comfortable that if it is completely flat.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_01
 And the battery is kind of rechargeable or it doesn't matter.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_03
 That's the point. The kinetic one is you can recharge by the...

0:05:46	SPEAKER_01
 That's what it means by kinetic?

0:05:49	SPEAKER_03
 Well, but just by moving your arm, the remote will accumulate energy.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_03
 But I don't know if it is feasible because I don't know if the user will move enough to provide the remote or the necessary energy.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_01
 We might check with our R&D department to see if they have this product.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. Ready for market.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_03
 And so can you go to the next slide, please?

0:06:27	SPEAKER_03
 So, that's summarizing what I have said.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_03
 So you're right. We can see our R&D.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_01
 The department.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_03
 If the kinetic method is sufficient to provide enough energy. That's it.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_01
 So I'll keep in touch with the R&D department.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_03
 Oh yeah, I take care of it.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_01
 So the titanium case is the normal case.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_01
 I'll show you some pictures that I have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_01
 Or something very...

0:07:35	SPEAKER_01
 Plastic, titanium or whatever.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_01
 There's another point I want to make is that the... Well, you have seen my presentation later on.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_01
 I point out some wide buttons and not the only ways you can use.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we can work it.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_01
 So the user interface is...

0:08:30	SPEAKER_01
 It gives you the aspect of a computer system, a program which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user in the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_01
 So it just gives you the ways to input data and we have an emphasized mode on the graphical user interface here.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_01
 The idea is to represent buttons as figures, diagrams, symbols and so you can easily...

0:09:04	SPEAKER_01
 When you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_01
 Watch the function of this.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_01
 It makes the exact first way.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_01
 Is it to use...

0:09:20	SPEAKER_01
 So next one?

0:09:22	SPEAKER_01
 This is function 5.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 So I can use the button, the mouse maybe.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_02
 The graph you can use on the entire first surface I still use.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_01
 So next night.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_01
 So here are some examples.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_01
 So they cluster the buttons together.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_01
 They group them into color and they have different forms as well.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_01
 But these interface are kind of confusing.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_01
 Basically they are too many buttons.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_01
 Next one?

0:10:01	SPEAKER_01
 So some people propose voice recognition and...

0:10:06	SPEAKER_01
 So by the way I received an email from one of the departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_01
 Produced by a company.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_01
 When you tell the user, good morning coffee machine and the machine will reply to you.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_01
 So I just got an email saying that...

0:10:24	SPEAKER_01
 And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_01
 So we might consider that.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, firstly.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_01
 The next one?

0:10:40	SPEAKER_01
 So some people use a spinning wheel with the LC display.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_01
 So instead of using the buttons, you have an LCD screen.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_01
 And then there you can use that as buttons.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_01
 You can use that as wheel.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_01
 So there could be an option as well.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_01
 Touch screen.

0:11:03	None
 Next one?

0:11:06	SPEAKER_01
 And some people propose a scroll button integrated with push button.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_01
 So you may have scroll button instead of just the push button like the one we have here.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_01
 Next one?

0:11:24	SPEAKER_01
 So there are a few aspects that I collected here.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_01
 So basically these deals with special users, children, handicapped people, old people, and...

0:11:47	SPEAKER_01
 Basically they are programmable, especially for children.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_01
 And then they also secure covers to protect secured and hidden programming and battery covers.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_01
 They will protect your settings.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_01
 But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just saying that currently in the market, they are remote controllers customizable for different people.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_01
 So that's the point.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_01
 Next one?

0:12:34	SPEAKER_01
 And you see this is the one where you have the protection cover.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_01
 It may be useful for children, they only see the buttons outside.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_01
 And for adults where you have more control, you can see the one inside.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_01
 So the adults might want to have a key to lock that.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_01
 So children will not touch the button inside.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_03
 That's a good idea.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_01
 Next one?

0:13:01	SPEAKER_01
 So this guy, this is another company that provides big buttons.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_01
 I see that it's useful for all people and then you don't get lost.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_01
 But for our product, we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 Eventually it is used and you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_01
 TV remote controller, where are you?

0:13:25	SPEAKER_01
 And then your BIPs and to say that I'm here.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_01
 For example, is it possible?

0:13:32	SPEAKER_02
 We should think of speech sentes in this case.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_03
 But as no man safe, there is already a commercial product available to do this.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_03
 We can check to integrate it into our new remote control.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_01
 And this is another one where you can...

0:13:55	SPEAKER_01
 The parts that are V standing for the volume.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_01
 So there's up arrow and down arrow.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_01
 But you see that in the V appears to be the down arrow on the top.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_01
 On the top up arrow, there's a V.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_01
 As if it's turning down, so it's confusing in the phrase.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_01
 So you want to avoid this kind of thing in the design.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_01
 And here is a short summary that I compiled.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_01
 After the findings I found.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_01
 Big buttons are convenient, voice recognition helps.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_01
 Push buttons, scroll buttons, spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_01
 And user-customizable is important.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_01
 And finally, simplicity is the key.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_01
 So we have many concepts there, but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I think it's fine to have reviewed all the possibilities.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_03
 But if we consider that the user interface is displayed on the TV screen, I don't think we need much buttons in the remote.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_03
 Since we just have to navigate and to have an OK or an enter key or things like that.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_03
 Because adding wheels or scrolls makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_02
 Or maybe we can include the user in the remote model and we should have just a button like help and you can get your button help.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_02
 And maybe you can see the user.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_03
 That's a good idea to have a help button.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_01
 A help button.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_01
 So you have to play on the screen.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_01
 So the user is removed.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_01
 So the element is the complicated documentation.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_01
 So people are afraid of looking at the help.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_00
 Once the user has a help button, they say this is a complicated stuff.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_00
 In the case of where they need it.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_02
 It's a psychological.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 Why are they doing the marketing?

0:16:21	SPEAKER_00
 OK.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_00
 And let us see what the market demands.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_00
 We could just go to my presentation.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I think it's just for user.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_02
 Testimizes.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's why.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_02
 For kids or old people.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it's just short as the remote with uncap which could be used for kids and if you remove the.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_02
 So it's the same.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_02
 Same remote with some can be used by both kids and old people.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_01
 Well, what I propose is that, you know, a remote controller, it could be a cube.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_01
 It's a small device that looks like a cube.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_01
 And maybe you can just change the buttons.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_01
 If you turn one side, you get one one button.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_01
 You turn the other side, you get the other buttons.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_01
 So for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer, they want lots of controls.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe for kids, they like a small.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_02
 So let's see what the.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_03
 Let's see the market demand.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_01
 One, we can decide what the market.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_00
 So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_00
 And we got the based on the responses from the questionnaires.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_00
 We also have some prizes for the most creative suggestions and we found the following suggestions which we could, which would be helpful for our design.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_00
 So 75% of the users, they find their remote controls very ugly.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_00
 They don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_00
 And 80% of the people, they are always, I mean, they are willing to spend more money if their remote control would look fancy.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_00
 And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behavior of the user.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_00
 And 75% of the users said there's a lot.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_00
 And 50% say they use only 10% of the buttons.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_00
 So the rest of the 90% of the buttons, they are not used most of the times.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_00
 So these were the findings which we found.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_00
 And also these are the frustrations with the present remote controls.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_00
 Most of 50% of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them rather than watching the TV.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_00
 And while the time they found the remote control, the program is finished.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_00
 So they have frustrated a lot.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_00
 And if the remote control is too complicated, it takes much time to learn the functionality of it.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_00
 So you can just see the percentage, 50% people responded that they always lose the remote, and 34% they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_00
 So keeping in view of all these findings and the frustrations, I think this should be the solution for them.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_00
 We should have an LCD on the remote control.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_03
 Oh.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I don't really see the advantage of having LCD on the remote control if we have a big screen and display on the screen.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, of course it's fancy, trendy and so on, but it's expensive to produce.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_03
 And it's not really easy.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_00
 As our service is that people are willing to pay more if we are remote or fancy.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_00
 So if you have an LCD on the remote, rather than looking onto the TV, you just look into your remote and navigate it.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_00
 We just say menu.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_00
 As we saw that iPod remote control, we just play around.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but when you play with the iPad, you don't have a big screen in front of you.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_02
 You can't use the screen instead of the big screen.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_01
 The existing screen, you eliminate the LCD.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_01
 After all, the LCD is just to display.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 And if you have the colorful screen, you can make the display colorful, fancy, a fancy SD-1 on the LCD, maybe even better.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:20:59	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, these were the points which we got from the market demands.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:21:05	SPEAKER_03
 I think we can focus on the fancy look on the...

0:21:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, more on the fancy design.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_03
 On the speech recognition, if the technology is available, but I think LCD will make us spend a lot of money for not so big results.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_01
 Remember we have a budget for the cost of producing the remote controller.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we have it.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_01
 So the thing is you can find out how much an LCD will cost.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_01
 And then we will decide again.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, that should be found out by the industry designers.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, we can find out the price in the previous time.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_03
 So the price of LCD display.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_00
 And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controller.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_01
 And also the cost for the speech recognition.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_02
 That's our R&D department.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_02
 It's just for our sport vocabulary.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's only for a limited vocabulary.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_00
 Say, IT commands or so.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_01
 And also the scroller button, how much will it cost?

0:22:09	SPEAKER_03
 Well, compared to the SIMPRA, SIMPRA, SIMPRA.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_00
 The scroll button, anyway, from the survey, we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_00
 Because they are just frightened to use the scrolling or help button.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think that as we have seen in the presentation, we have about 50% of the person.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_03
 Don't use the button.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_03
 Don't use the button.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_03
 So I think to have a five simple button is sufficient for our functionality.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_02
 But they are just...

0:22:53	SPEAKER_00
 They are not those much.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_03
 The thing is that we can add a functionality on the TV screen, like a list of functions.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_03
 And then you choose with the button to navigate.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_02
 So they add more power?

0:23:10	SPEAKER_02
 Or maybe we can make this 10% of the pattern more bigger than the others.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_03
 But if we could have a display, a user interface that is very complete on the TV screen, I think that just five buttons are sufficient.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_03
 You want to up left, right, down, and enter.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_03
 And you just select the functionality you want to access, things like that.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_00
 Or it could be like this as the people say if they have an LCD on the remote, not on the television.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_00
 Because when you have the LCD onto the television screen, you miss the picture in the background.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_00
 We are most focused on the commands.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_00
 So if you have an LCD in the remote, you just have a menu and increasing and lower the signs here to change the programs.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_00
 And this menu, when you press the menu, in the LCD, it displays as you go on pressing the menu.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_00
 It first displays volume, then the program, then the brightness, contrast and all this stuff.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_00
 And accordingly you can just increase or decrease.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but if you look at the LCD, you don't look at the TV screen.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_03
 So it's not really worth to get to have the image if you don't look at it.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_02
 And I think it changes the cost of the remote control.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that has to be checked out.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_01
 I think there is no contradiction here.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_01
 Because if there are a few buttons, you don't have to look at your controller anymore because you know where the buttons are.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_01
 So if you want to control the screen sharpness, you just say sharpness.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_01
 And then you just press left, increase or decrease button.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_01
 And the same for the volume.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_01
 And the channel, if you have the speech recognition day, just show your channel.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_01
 And then you don't even have to look at the controller.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_01
 So finally, that eliminates the need for LCD.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_01
 With the help of speech recognizer, you can...

0:25:19	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it would be better if you could just check out the cost with LCD and also with the speech recognition.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_00
 And then we could find which would be the most suitable for this case.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_01
 And the third problem was to find the remote control.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_00
 Always. So 50% of the people say they lose the remote.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_03
 Well, so we can think about a vocal cover and like find and when the remote control is signed.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_03
 And you can sign to a peep.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_00
 Just to make him beep.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's right.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_00
 That's exactly what I mean by voice commander.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_00
 Or it could be also something like this.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_00
 It's always boring to change the batteries of the remote control.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_00
 So we have someone charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control, we put it in the charger.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_00
 And when we are using that remote and if you miss player somewhere, in the charger we have a small button.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_00
 And just by pressing the button in the charger, the remote control beeps.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_00
 Wherever it is.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_03
 That's a good idea.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_03
 That's simple.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it also doesn't require a voice commander.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_00
 Because there are problems with the voice commander.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_02
 Sometimes we have to move the charger.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, charge it with the fixed speakers.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_00
 Because it's always with the electricity plug.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_03
 If there is not enough battery.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_03
 Also, and the remote is lost.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_01
 What we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off TV button, the off button, the remote, there will be an instructional screen.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_01
 Please charge me.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_01
 You never get it lost because every time you off the computer, the TV, you have asked the command, the TV command remote control will tell you to put it back to where the charger is.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_01
 That's a good reminder.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_01
 So you never get lost.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe for some people, but for my lazy people.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, because everything is programming inside.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_01
 So it's all about strategy.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_00
 And of course, the final point is the fancy look.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_00
 As we have seen earlier, the remotes which were displayed by Norman, they were on fancy.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_00
 Lovely.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_00
 Very big or something with lot of buttons.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_00
 I think we should have something.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the last one with the...

0:27:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the two parts was in the original.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, you say, if it's like that, even a kid who wants to have a control, he could just plug it and use it.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_00
 You can't avoid him.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_00
 But you can have a button for child lock.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_00
 So just by pressing the button with some code, you put a lock onto the remote so that he can't use even if I...

0:28:10	SPEAKER_03
 No, we can think about having on the user interface when you switch on the TV.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_03
 You can write a code or choose a category if it is kids.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's right.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_02
 Or maybe you have to choose some specific programs for kids.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_02
 And then...

0:28:34	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, did the...

0:28:35	SPEAKER_02
 Just push a kid's button so it's automatically...

0:28:41	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sorry.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_02
 So if he carries you much, we...

0:28:47	SPEAKER_00
 I think these are the four points where the market demands.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_00
 And so it's for the user interface, the design and industrial design.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_03
 So for my part, I will check the prices, the prices difference of what to use, where to use.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a little clearer for us in the next meeting that this poverty school being ordered.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_01
 I think we need to define also the set of vocabularies for the speech recognizer.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_01
 Because if you want this, say we can sort by channels or sort by TV programs, you have to decide the category of vocabularies for them.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_01
 If numbers, they are easy.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_01
 But if you want to name the channel by name.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I think we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like sports.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_03
 And then on the TV, you have a list with sports program playing now.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_00
 No, you have a problem there.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_00
 You see, if you have a voice, comments, and you are watching a score on a basketball score or something.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_00
 And if the score comes 25, 35, you just say 25.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_00
 And suddenly, the channel goes to 25.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_00
 So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_03
 Well, every possible world has a probability to come about the TV.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_00
 You just check out the probability that saying TV 25 and just ordinary 25.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_00
 Ordinary 25, almost there's a probability of being said about 60, 70%.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_00
 And TV 25, I don't know, it should be around one or two percent.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_00
 So it's better to have some prefix code before the number.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_01
 But I think that the user would like to associate the channel, we'll call the channel rather than the number.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, something, some code.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_01
 You say number channel number five of your TV corresponds to something else in the channel.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_01
 So some people may want to say I want to see this channel.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_00
 That would be too big and it would be difficult for the vocabulary also.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_01
 Check with the R&D department, the capability I recognize.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_02
 If you have the name of the channel, it would be difficult to say just the name of the channel.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it's convenient for the user.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but you have to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_00
 Also, it might be you just forgot the channel name, you'd only know the number.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_02
 Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary just for announcing the name of channels and include the vocabulary.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_01
 I think there's another way you can do is that when the user press a button to choose the channel, for example, then what you can do is that you can make the TV screen to split them into small little squares of images where you have a snapshot of every channel.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_01
 So let's say it's a 4x4 matrix of the images.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_01
 So now what you do is looking at all the 16 channels available at one time, you just use the control button there.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_01
 You just choose the option you want and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_02
 Or let's say the user create his own vocabulary.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_01
 So you don't use the speech recognizer in that way?

0:32:22	SPEAKER_02
 No, just you have in the beginning you have to train, you have to create a vocabulary.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, okay.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_02
 I also think each channel with the name.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_03
 I also think about another problem if there is more than one person watching TV.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, that's why I just wanted to recognize this.

0:32:49	SPEAKER_03
 One of the speakers recognizer should be able to distinguish between the two because I remember when I was a young child with my sister.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_03
 I want to watch this, I want to watch this.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_03
 We always want to watch different emission at the same time.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_03
 It could be a problem if someone passes by when you are watching TV and say, oh, TV, 30.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_03
 And just try.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_00
 And in the same lines we would have one more problem.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_00
 If you are using the television in the different environments, say in the factories or in the shops, there is a lot of noise and these voice commands if they fail to work, that would bring a bad name by a repetition for our company.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_00
 So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use the voice commands.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_00
 Say that it should be used in a silent, homely environment or something.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_02
 I will switch on or switch off the speech.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that should be an option.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think that is a good option because it is simple and simple to implement.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_00
 These are the practical problems.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_00
 So we need to take care of them in the design.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_02
 We will discard them in the next meeting. It is time to close this meeting.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_02
 We still have five minutes.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, it came around three minutes back.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_00
 So we are releasing.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_00
 I think we are just plastic.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_03
 So I see.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_00
 Save another.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_00
 30 minutes.

0:34:27	None
 Okay.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_02
 It is time to make this order or after the meeting.

0:34:36	None
 What is it?

0:34:38	SPEAKER_02
 When we are going to meet.

0:34:41	None
 Don't take that word.

0:34:43	None
 No, after the next one.

0:34:45	None
 Yes, it is on your person.

0:34:47	None
 Okay.

0:34:51	None
 Okay.

0:34:55	None
 Okay.

0:35:02	None
 Okay.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:35:17	None
 Okay.

0:35:23	None
 Okay.
