 a h In the last meeting we have discussed the functional design.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_02
 Now we will talk about the conceptual design.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_03
 I think I will see the details to my presentation on the components concept.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_03
 So can you please open I'm participant 2.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_03
 I will talk about the design.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_03
 The first thing I have done is to make a review together with the Manufactural department which components were available to build remote control.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_03
 So for energy sources we have to choose between the soror energy, hand in ammo and kinetic and the kinetic technique to store the energy.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_03
 We also can put regular battery in the remote control.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_02
 This is what we have decided in the last meeting.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_02
 But if we use battery.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, well I meant by battery I meant I would not have a wire between the remote control and the energy source.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_03
 But I didn't, we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the remote.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_03
 It's a point to this sketch.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_03
 Then the case material we have also several choices like wood, rubber, titanium or latex.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_03
 But well it's not a real issue for the technical point of view.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_03
 Concerning the interface we can put simple buttons or scrolls or buttons much more complicated.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_03
 But it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_03
 So this is the last point.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_03
 Let's choose the chips.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_03
 So what I have found is that I think basic battery or kinetic energy collection is the better way to provide energy.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_03
 Because I think soror energy won't work in the catalan environment.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we can start with these two main things.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_03
 For the case, well I think that titanium is a good choice because it's trendy.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_03
 It's modern and user will be very happy to have a nice remote.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_03
 For the interface, I think that we can achieve all the desired functionalities by just using rubber buttons, simple buttons.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_03
 And just this allow to use a regular chip.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_03
 That's how I will cheaper.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_03
 And so we can move to the next slide.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_01
 What is the single curved?

0:05:11	SPEAKER_03
 It's the shape of the remote.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_03
 The curve will fit into your hand when you grab it.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_01
 When you hold on it, it's comfortable to hold.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_03
 It's more comfortable that if it is completely flat.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_01
 And the battery is a rechargeable or it doesn't matter.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_03
 That's the point.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_03
 The kinetic one is you can recharge by the...

0:05:45	SPEAKER_01
 That's what it means by...

0:05:49	SPEAKER_03
 Just by moving your arm, the remote will accumulate energy.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_03
 But I don't know if it is feasible because I don't know if the user will move enough to provide the remote or the necessary energy.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_01
 We might check with our R&D department to see if they have this product.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_01
 Ready for market.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_03
 Can you go to the next slide, please.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_03
 That's summarized what I have said.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_03
 You're right.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_03
 We can see our R&D department.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_03
 If the kinetic method is sufficient to provide enough energy, that's it.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_01
 So I'll keep in touch with the R&D department.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_03
 Oh yeah, I take care.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_01
 So the Titanium case is the normal case.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_01
 I'll show you some pictures that I have.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_01
 And you tell me whether they are Titanium case or not.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_01
 I'm very sure that they are plastic, Titanium or whatever.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_01
 The point I want to make is that the work you have seen in my presentation later on.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_01
 I'll point out some white buttons.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_01
 Not the only ways you can use.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we will work it.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_01
 So the user interface is...

0:08:29	SPEAKER_01
 This is the aspect of a computer system, a problem which can be seen or hurt.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_01
 Otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism, the user uses to control its operation and input data.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_01
 So it just gives you the ways to input the data.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_01
 We have more... we have emphasized more on the graphical user interface here.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_01
 The idea is to represent buttons as figures, diagrams, symbols and so on.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_01
 So you can easily... when you look at the symbols, you understand what it is doing.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_01
 What's the function of this?

0:09:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_02
 I think it makes the EHF1 sphere easy to use.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_01
 It's on the next one.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_01
 It's function 5.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 So I can use the mouse.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_02
 I can easily use the interface.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_01
 So the next...

0:09:33	SPEAKER_01
 So here are some examples.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_01
 So they clustered the buttons together.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_01
 They grouped in to color them.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_01
 And they have different forms as well.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_01
 But these interface are kind of confusing.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_01
 Basically, there are too many buttons.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_01
 Next one.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_01
 So some people are a proposed voice recognition.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_01
 So by the way, I received an email from one of our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_01
 This is by a company.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_01
 When you tell the... you say, good morning coffee machine and the machine will reply to you.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_01
 So I just got an email saying that.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_01
 And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_01
 So we might consider that.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, of course.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_01
 The next one.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_01
 So some people use... some people use a spinning wheel with the LC display.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_01
 So instead of using the buttons, you have an LC display screen.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_01
 And then there you can...

0:10:53	SPEAKER_01
 You can use that as buttons.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_01
 You can use that as wheel.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_01
 So that could be an option as well.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_01
 Touch screen.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_01
 Next one.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_01
 And some people propose a scroll button integrated with push button.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_01
 So you may have scroll button instead of just the push button.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_01
 Like the one we have here.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_01
 Next one.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:11:27	SPEAKER_01
 So there are a few aspects that I collected here.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_01
 So basically these deals with special users.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_01
 Children, handicapped people, old people, and...

0:11:47	SPEAKER_01
 And basically they are programmable, especially for children.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_01
 And...

0:11:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_01
 And then they also secure covers to protect...

0:12:02	SPEAKER_01
 Secured and hidden programming and battery covers.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_01
 They will protect your settings.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_01
 But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just saying that currently in the market, they are...

0:12:17	SPEAKER_01
 They are controlled.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_01
 They are remote controllers.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_01
 Customizable for different people.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_01
 So that's the point.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_01
 Next one.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_01
 And you see this is the one where you have the protection cover.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_01
 It may be useful for children.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_01
 They only see the buttons outside.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_01
 And for adults where you have more control, you can see the one inside.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_01
 So the adults might want to have a key to lock that.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_01
 So children will not touch the button inside.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_03
 So good idea.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_01
 The next one.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_01
 So this guy, this is another company that provides big buttons.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_01
 I see that it's useful for all people and then you don't get lost.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_01
 But for our product, we don't need a big one.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_01
 Because you have voice recognition.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 Eventually it is used.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_01
 And you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_01
 TV remote controller, where are you?

0:13:25	SPEAKER_01
 And then you have beeps and to say that I'm here.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_01
 For example, is it possible?

0:13:32	SPEAKER_02
 We should be in good speed, it is.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_04
 In this case, no?

0:13:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, but as Norman says, there is a radio commercial product available to do this.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_03
 We can check it to integrate it in two hours on newer remote control.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_01
 And this is another one where you can...

0:13:55	SPEAKER_01
 The patch, there's a V standing for the volume.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_01
 So there's an up arrow and a down arrow.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_01
 But you see that in the V, the V appears to be the down arrow on the top.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_01
 On the top, up arrow.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_01
 If you up arrow, there's a V.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_01
 Like, SUV is turning down, so it's confusing in the face.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_01
 So I want to avoid this kind of thing in the design.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_01
 And here is a short summary that I compile.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_01
 After the findings I found, big buttons are convenient, voice recognition helps.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_01
 Push buttons, scroll buttons, spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_01
 And I use the customizable, it's important.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_01
 And finally, simplicity, simplicity is the key.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_01
 So we have many concepts there, but we have to choose later on.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_01
 Which ones are important to be used?

0:14:50	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I think you...

0:14:54	SPEAKER_03
 It's fine, you are reviewed all the possibilities.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_03
 But if we consider that the user interface is displayed on the TV screen, I don't think we need much buttons in the remote.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_03
 Since we just have to navigate and to have a OK or an ENTER key or things like that.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_03
 Because adding wheels or scrolls makes the thing more complicated and more expensive.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_02
 Or maybe we can include the user, Maria in the remote mode itself.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_02
 And we should have just a button like help and you say, you press the button help and maybe you see the user.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_03
 That's a good idea to have a help button.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_01
 A help button.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_01
 So you are deep-spare on the screen.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_01
 On the TV screen, on the TV screen, you just use the button.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_01
 How to use your remote.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_01
 OK, so that eliminates all the complicated documentation.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_00
 OK, but people are offered of looking at the help.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_00
 Once they see the help button, they see, or this is the complicated stuff.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_00
 No, in the case where they need the...

0:16:18	SPEAKER_02
 It's a psychology.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 Where they need the marketing.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_00
 OK, and let us see what the market demands.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_00
 We could just go to my presentation.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_02
 It's just for user, that's too much, you know.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's fine.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_02
 For kids or out people.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, you just showed us the remote with a cap, which could be used for kids and if you remodeled...

0:16:39	SPEAKER_00
 So it's the same remote with some...

0:16:42	SPEAKER_02
 It can be used by both kids and out people.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_01
 Well, what I propose is that, you know, a remote controller...

0:16:54	SPEAKER_01
 It could be a cube.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_01
 It's a small device that looks like a cube.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_01
 And maybe you can just change the buttons.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_01
 If you turn one side, you get one button.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_01
 You turn the other side, you get the other buttons.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_01
 So for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer, they want lots of controls.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe for kids.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_02
 Kids they like.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_02
 Small.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_02
 Small too.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_03
 Let's see what the market demands.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_01
 One, the kind of side what the market demands.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, yes.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_00
 So we just made a marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_00
 And we got based on the responses from the questionnaires.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_00
 We also have some prizes for the most creative suggestions.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_00
 And we found the following suggestions, which we could...

0:18:13	SPEAKER_00
 Which would be helpful for our design.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_00
 So 75% of the users, they find the remote controls very ugly.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_00
 They don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_00
 And 80% of the people, they are always...

0:18:29	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_00
 And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behavior of the user.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_00
 And 75% of the users said there's a lot.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_00
 And 50% said they use only 10% of the buttons.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_00
 So the rest of the 90% of the buttons, they are not used most of the times.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_00
 So this was the findings which we found.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_00
 And also these are the frustrations with the present remote controls.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_00
 Most of 50% of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_00
 And people are always searching for them rather than watching the TV.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_00
 And while the time they found the remote control, the program is finished.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_00
 So they frustrated a lot.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_00
 And if the remote control is too complicated, it takes much time to learn the functionality of it.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_00
 So you can just see the percentage, 50%.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_00
 People that responded that they always lose their remorse and 34%.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_00
 They say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_00
 So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations, I think this should be the solution for them.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_00
 We should have an LCD on the remote control.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_03
 Oh.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I don't really see the advantage of having LCD on the remote control.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_03
 If we have a big screen.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_03
 A big screen and the display on the screen.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, of course it's fancy, trendy and so on.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_03
 But it's expensive to produce.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_03
 And it's not true.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_00
 As our service is that people are willing to pay more if your remotes are fancy.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_00
 So if you have an LCD on the remote, rather than looking onto the TV, you just look into your remote and navigate it.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_00
 You just say menu.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_00
 As we saw that iPod remote control.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_03
 They just play around.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but when you play with the iPad, you don't have a big screen in front of you.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_02
 And you use the screen instead of the PC.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_01
 If you use the existing screen, you eliminate the LCD.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_01
 After all, the LCD is just to display.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 And if you have the colorful screen, you can make the display colorful, fancy, as fancy as the one on the LCD.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_01
 It may be even better.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, those were the points which we got from the market demands.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we can focus on the fancy look.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_01
 More on the fancy design.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_03
 On the speech recognition, if the technology is available, but I think LCD will make us spend a lot of money for not so big results.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_01
 Remember we have a budget for the cost of producing the remote controller.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_01
 So the thing is, you can find out how much an LCD will cost.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_01
 And then we will decide again.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, that should be found out by the industry designers.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_01
 We can find out the price until we have the same time.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_03
 So price of LCD display.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_00
 And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controller.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_01
 And also the cost for the speech recognition.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_02
 As our R&D department.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_02
 It's just for sport vocabulary.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_00
 It's not only for a limited vocabulary.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_00
 It's a 80 commands also.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_01
 And also the scroller button, how much will it cost?

0:22:09	SPEAKER_03
 Well, compared to the simple, simple, simple button.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_00
 The scroll button, anywhere from the survey, we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_00
 They're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_03
 I think that, as we have seen in the presentation, about 50% of the percentage.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_03
 Then use the button.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_03
 Don't use the button.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_03
 So I think to have a simple button is sufficient for our functionality.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't mean that the other buttons are not in the CREO or in port.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but they are just getting used to it.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_00
 They're not too smart.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_03
 The thing is, is that we can add a functionality on the TV screen, like a list of functions.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_03
 And then you choose with the button to navigate.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe we can make this 10% of button more bigger than the others.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but if we could have a display, a user interface that is very complete on the TV screen, I think that just five buttons are sufficient.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_03
 We want to go up, left, right down and enter.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_03
 And you just select the functionality you want to access, or things like that.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_03
 You don't have to switch to a channel to another room.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_00
 Or it could be like this, as the people say, if they have an LCD on the remote, not on the television.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_00
 Because when you have the LCD on to the television screen, you miss the picture in the background.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_00
 We are most focused on the commands.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_00
 So if you have an LCD in the remote, you just have a menu and increasing and lower the signs here to change the programs.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_00
 And this menu, when you press the menu, in the ulcerative displays, as you go on pressing the menu, it first displays volume, then the program, then the brightness, contrast, and all this stuff.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_00
 And accordingly, you can just increase or decrease.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but if you look at the LCD, you don't look at the TV screen.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_03
 So it's not really worth to have the image if you don't look at it.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_02
 And I think it's the cost of the remote control.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that has to be checked.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_01
 I think there is no contradiction here.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_01
 Because if there are few buttons, you don't have to look at your controller anymore because you know where the buttons are.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_01
 So if you want to control the screen, sharpness, you just say sharpness.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_01
 And then you just press left, increase or decrease button.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_01
 And the same for the volume.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_01
 And the channel, if you have the speech recognition day, just shout your channel, just tell your channel.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_01
 And then you don't even have to look at the controller.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_01
 So finally, that will eliminate the need for LCD.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_01
 With the help of speech recognition, you can...

0:25:20	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it would be better if you could just check out the cost with LCD and also with the speech recognition.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_00
 And then we could find which would be more suitable for NISCAS.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_00
 And the third problem was to find the remote control.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_00
 So 50% of the people say they lose the remote.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_03
 So we can think about where the vocal command like find and when the remote control is assigned to a people.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_03
 Or just to make him be...

0:25:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's right.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_00
 That's exactly what I mean by voice command there.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_00
 Or it could be also something like this.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_00
 It's always boring to change the batteries of the remote control.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_00
 So we have someone charger there.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_00
 And whenever we don't use the remote control, we put it in the charger.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_00
 And when we are using that remote and if you miss plug somewhere, in the charger we have a small button.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_00
 And just by pressing the button in the charger, the remote control beeps, wherever it is.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_03
 And that's a good idea, that's simple.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it also doesn't require a voice command.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_00
 Because there are problems with the voice command.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_02
 Because we have to move the charger.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_00
 Because it's always with the electricity plug.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, if there is not enough battery.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_03
 Also, and the remote is less.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's right.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_01
 What we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off TV button, the off button, the remote there will be an instruction on the screen.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_01
 Please charge me.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_01
 You never get it lost because every time you're off the computer, the TV, the remote control will tell you to put it back to the charger.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_00
 It's a good reminder, yeah, that's right.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_01
 So you never get lost TV.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:11	None
 Yeah.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_02
 That before some people, but former lazy people.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, because everything is programmed inside.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_01
 So it's all about strategy.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_00
 And of course, the final point is the fancy look.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_00
 As we have seen earlier, the remote which were displayed by Norman, they were fancy.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_00
 Very big or something.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_00
 With lot of buttons.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_00
 I think we should have something.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the last one with the...

0:27:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we did two parts with the entire original...

0:27:48	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it's like that.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_00
 Even a kid who wants to have a control, he could just plug it and use it.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_00
 He can't avoid him.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_00
 But you can have a button for child lock.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_00
 So just by pressing the button with some code, you put a lock onto the remote so that he can't use even fun.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_03
 No, we can think about having on the user interface when you switch on the TV.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_03
 You can write a code or choose a category.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_03
 If it is kids...

0:28:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_02
 Or maybe you have to choose some specific programs for kids.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_02
 And then...

0:28:34	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, these are...

0:28:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_02
 Just push the kids button.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_02
 So it's automatically...

0:28:42	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sorry.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_02
 So if we can resume what we...

0:28:47	SPEAKER_00
 I think these are the four points where the market demands.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_00
 And so it's for the user interface design and industrial design.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_03
 So for my part, I will check the prices, the prices difference of what to use, where to use it.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think it's a bit clearer for us in the next meeting that this possibility is going to be included.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_01
 I think we need to define also the set of vocabularies for the speech organizer.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_01
 Because if you want us to say we can sort by channels or sort by TV programs, you have to decide the category of vocabularies for them.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_01
 If numbers, they are easy.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_01
 But if you want to name the channel by name...

0:29:34	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I think we can...

0:29:36	SPEAKER_03
 We can have just numbers for the channels and you can say to your remote control like sports and then on the TV, you have a list with sports program playing now.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_00
 No, we have a problem there.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_00
 You say, if you have a voice comments and you are watching a score on a basketball score or something and if the score comes 25 or 35, you just say 25.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_00
 And suddenly the channel goes to 25.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_00
 So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_03
 Well, every possible world has a probability to come about of the TVs.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, you just check out the probability that saying TV 25 and just ordinary 25.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_00
 Ordinary 25, you're almost there is a probability of being set on 60-70%.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_00
 And TV 25, I don't know, it should be around 1 or 2%.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_00
 So it's better to have some prefix code before the number.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_01
 But I think that the user would like to associate the channel, we'll call the channel rather than the number.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, something, some code.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_01
 You say number, channel number 5 of your TV correspond to something else in the channel.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_01
 So some people may want to say, I want to see this channel.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_00
 That would be too big and it would be difficult for the vocabulary also.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_01
 Check with the RND department, the capability of our connoisseur.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_02
 The name of the channel, it would be difficult to say just the name of the channel.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it's convenient for the user.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but you have to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_00
 Or it might be you just forgot the channel name, you'd only know the number.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_02
 Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_02
 Just pronouncing the name of the channel.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_01
 I think there's another way you can do is that when the user press a button to choose the channel, for example, then what you can do is that you can make the TV screen to split them into small little squares of images.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_01
 Where you have a snapshot of every channel. So let's say it's a 4x4 matrix of the images.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_01
 So now what you do is looking at all the 16 channels available at one time, you just use the control button there.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_01
 You just choose the option you want and then you just hit the button and then you'll go to that channel.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_02
 Or let's the user create his own vocabulary.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_01
 So you don't use the spiritual colonizer in that way.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_02
 No, just you have in the beginning you have to train, you have to create a vocabulary.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, okay.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_02
 I also say I think each channel with name.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_03
 I also think about another problem if there is more than one person who is watching TV.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the spiritual colonizer should be able to distinguish between the two.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_03
 Because I remember when I was a young child with my sister.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_03
 We always want to watch different emissions at the same time.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_03
 So it could be a problem if well.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_03
 If someone passes by when you are watching TV and say, oh TV, 30.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_00
 And in the same lines we would have one more problem.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_00
 If you are using the television in the different environment, say in the factories or in the shops, there is lot of noise.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_00
 And this voice comments if they fail to work, that would bring a bad name by repetition for our company.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_00
 So I think we should specify some prerequisites if we want to use the voice comments.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_00
 Say that it should be used in silent, homely environment or something.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_02
 Or we can switch on or switch off the spatial.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that should be an option.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's why I think that's a good option because it's simple and simple to implement.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_00
 And these are the practical problems. So many protector of them in the design.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_02
 We will discard them in the next meeting. It's time to close this meeting.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_01
 We will stay at 5 minutes.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, it came around 3 minutes back.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_00
 So we are only 5 minutes back.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_00
 I think we can just press the...

0:34:18	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_03
 So we will see you out.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_00
 Save another 30 minutes.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_02
 It's a great meeting place.

0:34:34	None
 Order or after the meeting.

0:34:37	None
 What is it?

0:34:38	SPEAKER_02
 When we are going to meet.

0:34:40	None
 I'll do it.

0:34:41	None
 One pack, that one.

0:34:42	None
 No, I'll do it.

0:34:43	None
 Is it an ordinary person?

0:34:44	None
 Yeah, it's an ordinary person.

0:34:46	None
 Okay.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.
