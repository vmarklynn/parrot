0:00:00	SPEAKER_06
 what things to talk about.

0:00:02	SPEAKER_06
 Really?

0:00:03	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, it was horrible.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_06
 It was incentive.

0:00:06	SPEAKER_06
 You recorded it?

0:00:08	SPEAKER_00
 Hello?

0:00:09	SPEAKER_00
 Hello?

0:00:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:00:11	SPEAKER_00
 Which one?

0:00:12	SPEAKER_03
 All right, good.

0:00:13	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:00:23	None
 Did you do something?

0:00:25	None
 OK.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_06
 And I guess I'm doing something.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_06
 So basically, the result of much thinking since the last time we met, but not as much writing, is a sheet that I have a lot of thoughts and justification to comment on.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_06
 But I'll just pass out as is right now.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_06
 So here's what's around.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_06
 And there's two things.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_06
 So one on one side is a revised, updated semantics

0:00:50	None
 specification. The other side is revised.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_05
 This is just one sheet, right?

0:00:54	SPEAKER_00
 No, just one sheet.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_00
 OK.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_00
 So this thing also.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_06
 And it's very similar to the reverse.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_06
 If you change it, it's always more.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_06
 But before I don't think everyone here is seen all of this.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_06
 So sure, here, begin.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_06
 As usual, the disclaimers are there.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_06
 All these things are, it's only slightly worse people than it was before.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_06
 And after a little bit more discussion, especially that people that I have formerly missed at all in the next release, probably changing that so far.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_06
 Maybe I will, let's start with number two, actually, on the notation.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_06
 Because that's thinking possible, and there are more familiar to people.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_06
 OK.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_06
 So the top block is just sort of a abstract technique, sort of like those things are the kinds of things that we can have.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_06
 And certain things that have changed, to have changed back to this, that there's been a little bit of going back and forth.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_06
 But basically, obviously, all the constructions have some kind of name.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_06
 I forgot to include that you could have a type included in this line, so it's like, well, there's an example.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_06
 The text for example, the end, it has a causal construction.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_06
 So just to show it doesn't have to be a beautiful way to get people to be able to send text as well.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_06
 These three have various ways of doing certain things.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_06
 I'll just try to go through them.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_06
 So they could all have a type at the beginning.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_06
 And then they say the keyword construction.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I see.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_02
 So the current syntax is, if there's a type, it's before construct.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_02
 OK, that's fine.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_06
 OK.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_06
 And then it has a block that is constituents.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_06
 And as usual, I guess all the constructions here, all the examples here have only one type of constituent that is a constructional constituent.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_06
 I think that's actually going to turn out to be certainly the most common kind.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_06
 But in general, instead of the word construct, there are clear who might have meaning or form as well.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_06
 So there's some element that isn't yet constructional, and this is the maps one and meaning.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_06
 OK.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_06
 The main change with the constructs, which each of which has a keyword construct, and then some name, and then some type of classification, is that it's often, sometimes the case in the first case here that you know what kind of construction is.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_06
 So for example, whatever I have here, it's going to be a form of the word throw, or it's going to be a word, you know, happy, or something like that.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_06
 Some people may be a specific word, or maybe you'll have the type, you'll say, I need a spatial relation for easier.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_06
 I need a directional decimal right here.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_06
 You could have an actual type here.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_06
 Or you could just say, in the same case, that you only know the meaning of type.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_06
 So a very common example is this one that, you know, in directed motion, the first person to do some nature of being agent of some kind, often a human, right?

0:03:41	SPEAKER_06
 So if I run down the street, then I, I run as a chief, it's type, I mean, the category is what's there.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_06
 But the new kind is this one is sort of a pair.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_06
 And sort of skipping the moths and whatever.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_06
 The idea is that sometimes there are general constructors that you know that you're going to be equivalent of a noun phrase, or a noun phrase, or something like that.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_06
 And usually it has a whole consideration that I don't want with it.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_06
 And then you might know something much more specific, depending on what construction you're going to go about, what meaning, what specific you want.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_06
 So the example, again, at the bottom of a directed motion, you might need a nominal expression to take the place of, you know, the big,

0:04:26	None
 the big, the tall, dark man walked into the room. But because of the nature of this particular construction, you know, not just that it's nominal or some kind, but in particular it's some kind of anemone, nominal, like usual, like just as well as a light.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_06
 So for now, I know we're just having complicated expression.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_06
 So I don't know if this is textable, but something that gives you a way to go with the structural and the new types.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_06
 OK, then I don't think the, at least, yeah, none of these examples have anything different for formal constraints, but you've been referred to any of the available elements in scope, which here are the constructs, to say something about the relation.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_06
 And I think, if you know if you compare the top block and the textual block, we dropped like the little F subscript.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_06
 F subscript 3, 4, 2, the form piece of the construct.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_06
 Good.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_06
 And I think that the general will be unended US.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_06
 Like if you're giving a formal constraint, then you're referring to the normal pull of that.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_06
 So by saying, if I just said name one, then that means name one, formal, full time level, which makes sense.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_06
 There are certain times when we're having a discussion to that, which case you could just communicate here, I think, meaningful for some reason, right?

0:05:42	SPEAKER_06
 Or actually, as we're often that, only to handle this, one special case of George and Jerry walking to the room in that order.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_06
 So we have a few funny things where something in the meaning might refer to something in the form.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_06
 But we're not going to really worry about that from right now.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_06
 And there are ways we can be more specific if we have to use later on.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_06
 OK.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_06
 And so in terms of the relations, as usual in every four, and I should have put in a couple of things in something that isn't an interval relation, but in four, you might also have a value binding.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_06
 You know, you can say that name one dot number of goals, plural or something like that.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_06
 There are certain things that are actually value similar to the bindings below.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_06
 But usually, they're going to be value and the alert, right?

0:06:29	SPEAKER_06
 OK.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_06
 And then again, semantic constraints here are just bindings.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_06
 There was talk of changing the name of that.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_06
 John, you're not going to be like, fight about that.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_06
 You like about changing it to semantic effects, which I thought in a little bit to order bias and semantic bindings, which I thought might be too restrictive in case we don't have only binding.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_06
 And so it was an issue whether constraints, there were some linguists who reacted against constraints saying, oh, it is not used for matching, then it shouldn't be called a constraint.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_06
 But I think we want to be uncommitted about whether it's used for matching or not, because I think we thought it was some situations where it was useful to use whatever bindings are for actually modified constraints.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_02
 Well, you definitely want to decouple the formalism from the parsing strategy.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_02
 So whether or not it's used for matching or only for verification, for sure.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what term we want to use, but we don't want to.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_06
 There was one time when the context explained why constraints wasn't misleading or it's in.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_06
 And I think the reason that he gave was similar to the reason why John thought it was like, the record was just an interesting coincidence.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_06
 But until I was like, OK, well, both of you don't like it.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_06
 I'm going to change it.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_06
 But I'm starting to like it again.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_06
 So I'm going to be like, what?

0:07:48	SPEAKER_04
 Well, you know what?

0:07:49	SPEAKER_04
 If then-trace.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_04
 You're what the then-trace is called?

0:07:53	SPEAKER_06
 What?

0:07:54	SPEAKER_06
 Concument?

0:07:56	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, but it's not if then.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_02
 Anyway, so the other strategy you guys can consider is when you don't know what word you could put no word, just meaning.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_02
 OK, and let-

0:08:10	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, that's true.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_03
 So that's why you put semantic constraints up top and meaning bindings done here.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, oops, nope.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_06
 That was a mistake of cutting paste.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_06
 OK.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_06
 I'm sorry.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_06
 That one's an unintentional.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_03
 So there should be semitic.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_06
 And unintentional, because it's not Jordan.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_06
 You're actually-

0:08:28	SPEAKER_03
 So there should be semitic constraints down at the bottom?

0:08:30	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_06
 OK.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_06
 Well, unless I go with meaning, whatever.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_06
 Or whatever.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_06
 I'm going to be good at semantic, but I think the best is of other people's biases.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_02
 Minor pros.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_02
 Miner pros.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_06
 OK.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_06
 So I think the middle block doesn't really give you any more information next to the top block.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_06
 And the bottom block similarly, only just illicit- so all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts and that you can drop the- that you can give dual types.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_06
 One thing I should mention about designates, I think, actually assistant cross-leads as well.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_06
 So strike out the M subscript on the middle block.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_06
 So basically now, this little change actually goes along with a big linguistic change, which is that designates isn't only something for this and mandates to worry about now.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_06
 So we want designates to actually- one of the constituents, which acts like a head and some respect, but is sort of really important for a composition later on.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_06
 So for instance, if some other construction says, argue of type, is this part of type whatever, the designate tells you which sort of part is the minimum part.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_06
 So if you have the big red ball, you want to know if this object's where noun, but ball is going to be the designated element of that kind of phrase.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_06
 There is a slight complication here, which is that when we talk about form, it's useful sometimes to talk about- to talk about there also being a designated object.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_06
 And we think that there will be the same one.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_06
 So the ball is the head of the phrase, the big red ball, and the entity, to know if it's by the word ball, is sort of the semantic head in some ways.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_02
 And there's some cases where the grammar depends on some form property of the head.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_02
 And this enables you to get that.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_02
 If I understand your right side, yeah, yeah.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_06
 And you might be able to say things like if the head has to go last and the head final language, you can refer to the head as a formal head as opposed to the rest of the form having to be at the end of that.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_06
 So that's a useful thing to get some general structure.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_02
 OK, so that all looks good.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_02
 Let me- oh, I don't know.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_06
 Are you finished?

0:10:36	SPEAKER_06
 There is a list of things that isn't included, but you can ask questions that might.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_02
 So if I understand this, aside from construde and all that sort of stuff, the differences are mainly that we've gone to the possibility of having form meaning pairs for a type, or we actually gone back to if we go back far enough.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_06
 It's a construction meeting.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_06
 So it's not clear that what now is a construction type

0:11:09	None
 and the type. So I don't know what a form is.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I see.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sorry.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_02
 You're right.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_02
 Construction type.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_02
 That's fine.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_02
 But it-

0:11:20	SPEAKER_06
 Well, and a previous version of the division certainly allowed you to single out the meaning bit by- so you could say constructs of type whatever does it mean something.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_06
 But that was mostly for reference purposes, just to refer to the mean pool.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_06
 I don't think that it was often used to give an extra meaning to type constraints on the meeting,

0:11:38	None
 which is really what we want most of the time I think. Mm-hmm.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_06
 I don't know if we'll ever have a case where we actually- if there is a form category constraint, you could imagine having a triple there.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no, no.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think so.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_02
 I think that you'll do fine.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_02
 In fact, these are as long as- as Mark is- these are form constraints.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_02
 So nominal expression is- the fact that this animate is- man, the fact that it's a nominal expression, I would say, on most people's notion of higher form types, this is one.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's just fine.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_05
 Which is fine.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_05
 Now, I mentioned this.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know if I ever explained this, but the point of- I mentioned in the last meeting, the point of having something called nominal expression is because it seems like having the verb subcategorized, for, you know, like, say, taking as its object, just some expression which designates an object, or designates a thing, or whatever.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_05
 That leads to some syntactic problems, basically.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_05
 So you want to, you know, sort of have this problem like, OK, well, I'll put the word, let's say the word dog.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_05
 You know, that has to come right after the verb, because we know verb meets its object.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_05
 And then we have a construction that says, oh, you can have the proceeding a noun.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_05
 And so you have this sort of problem that the verb has to meet that does it not come in.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_05
 And you can get, you know, the kicked dog or something like that meaning kicked the dog.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_05
 So you kind of have to let this phrase idea in there.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_02
 But I have no problem with what I think it's fine.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_06
 You may not be like everyone else in Berkeley.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_05
 But that's OK.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, we sort of thought we were getting away with, I mean, this is not reverting to the X-bar theory of phrase structure, but I just know that this is, like we didn't originally have in mind that verbs would subcategorize for a particular sort of form.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_06
 Well, there's no arrangement to this.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_06
 The question was, did we want directed motion, which is an argument structure construction?

0:13:51	SPEAKER_06
 Did we want it to worry about anything more than the fact that it has semantic, you know, it's sort of a frame-based construction?

0:13:58	SPEAKER_06
 So one option that Keith had mentioned also was like, well, if you have more abstract construction, such as subject predicate, basically things like grammatical relations, those could intersect with these in such a way that subject predicate or subject predicate verb object, would require that those things fill subject object are non-expressions.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_06
 And that would be a little bit cleaner in some way.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_06
 But for now, I mean.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_02
 But it's just moving it.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_02
 Moving it differently.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_02
 It constraints around.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_06
 OK, so that's.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_06
 Basically, the point is there has to be that constraint somewhere.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_02
 And so that was the.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_06
 Reverb is not having now.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_02
 And sort of going with that is that the designatim also now is a pair instead of just the meaning.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_02
 And aside from some terminology, that's basically yet.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_02
 I'm asking.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_06
 The unaddressed questions in this definitely would, for instance, be semantic constraints we talked about.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_06
 Here are just bindings.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_06
 But we might want to introduce mental spaces.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_06
 There's all these things.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_02
 The mental spacing is clearly not.

0:15:10	None
 Right.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_06
 So there's going to be some extra definitely other notation only for that, which we skip for now.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_02
 By the way, I do want to get on that as soon as rubber gets back.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_02
 So the mental space thing.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_02
 Obviously, constroul is a big component of that.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_02
 So there's probably not worth trying to do anything till it gets back.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_02
 But sort of as soon as it gets back, I think we ought to.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_05
 So what's the time frame I forgot again when you're going away for a lot?

0:15:42	SPEAKER_04
 As a mental bridge, I'm skipping forth of July.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_04
 Right afterwards.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_06
 What?

0:15:52	SPEAKER_06
 You're missing the premiering America.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_06
 It's a point of spending a year here.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_03
 Well, he went to college here.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah, I forgot.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_02
 It furthermore, it's well worth missing.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_06
 I like spending forth of July in other countries.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_06
 Winner, right?

0:16:08	SPEAKER_06
 OK.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_06
 So that's great.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_06
 Construct, OK, so there was one question that came out.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_06
 I hate this thing.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_06
 This is right.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_06
 So something like past, which we think is a very simple.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_06
 We've often just stuck in it as a feature.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_06
 This event takes place before it's each time.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_06
 OK, it's what this means.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_06
 It's often thought of as it is also considered a mental space by lots of people around.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_06
 So there's issue of well, sometimes there are really exotic, explicit space builders that say in France blah, blah, blah.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_06
 And you have to build up.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_06
 You would imagine that would require you be very specific about machinery.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_06
 Whereas past is a very conventionalized one.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_06
 We sort of know what it means.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_06
 But we don't necessarily want to unload all the notation every time we see that it's past tense.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_06
 So we can think of our, just like X-Siem of walk, we first do this kind of thing.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's exactly right.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_06
 Past refers to a certain configuration of this thing with respect to it.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_06
 So we're kind of like having an arcade.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, in both ways.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_06
 Right?

0:17:05	SPEAKER_02
 So I think that we'll have to see how it works out when we do the details.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_02
 But my intuition would be that that's right.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_04
 You want to do the same for space?

0:17:13	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry?

0:17:15	SPEAKER_04
 Space?

0:17:16	SPEAKER_06
 Space?

0:17:17	SPEAKER_04
 Here?

0:17:18	SPEAKER_04
 No?

0:17:18	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, instead of just time?

0:17:21	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, yeah.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, same thing.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_06
 So there are very conventionalized like dakedic ones, right?

0:17:25	SPEAKER_06
 And then I think for other spaces that you introduce, you could just attach whatever you could build up and appropriately structure according to them.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_04
 Now, this basically would involve everything you can imagine to fit under your seat, thought to something.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_04
 Where it's actually dependent on us now, what was passed, what is in the future, versus what is here, what is there, what is.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_06
 So time and space, we'll get that on the other side a little, like very minimally.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_06
 There's a slot for setting time and setting place.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_06
 And you know, you can imagine for both of those, there are absolute things you could say about the time and place.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_06
 And then there are many more interestingly, linguistically, anyway, there are relative things that you relate the event in time and space to where you are now.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_06
 If there's something a lot more complicated, like hypothetical, whatever, then you have to do your job.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_06
 Or somebody's job, and then get up like this.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I mean, I'm curious about how much of the mental, I mean, I'm not sure that the formalism, sort of the grammatical side of things, is going to have that much going on in terms of the mental space stuff.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_05
 Basically, all of the so-called space builders that are in the sentence are going to sort of, I think of it as sort of giving you the coordinates of, you know, assuming that at any point in discourse there's the possibility that we could be sort of talking about a bunch of different world scenarios, whatever.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_05
 And the speaker is supposed to be keeping track of those.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_05
 The construction that you actually get is just going to sort of give you a cue as to which one of those that you've already got going.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_05
 You're supposed to add structure to.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_05
 So in France, Watergate wouldn't have heard Nixon or something like that.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_05
 Well, you say, all right, I'm supposed to add some structure to my model of this hypothetical past France universe or something like that.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_05
 The information in the sentence tells you that much, but it doesn't tell you exactly what the point of doing so is.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_05
 So for example, depending on the linguist context, it could be like the question is, for example, what does Watergate refer to there?

0:19:30	SPEAKER_05
 Does it refer to, if you just hear that sentence cold, the assumption is that when you say Watergate, you're referring to a Watergate-like scandal, as we might imagine it happening in France, but in a different context, oh, you know, if Nixon had apologized right away, I wouldn't, you know, Watergate wouldn't have heard him so badly in the US and in France, it wouldn't have heard him at all.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_05
 Now that Watergate, we're now talking about the real one and the wood, sort of, it's a sort of different dimension of hypotheticality.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, we're not saying what's hypothetical about this world.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_05
 In the first case, hypothetically, we're imagining that Watergate happened in France.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_05
 In the second case, we're imagining hypothetically that Nixon had apologized right away or something, right?

0:20:10	SPEAKER_05
 So a lot of this isn't happening at the grammatical level.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_05
 And so I don't know where that sits then, sort of the idea of sorting out what the person meant.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_06
 The grammatical things, such as the acceleraries that introduce these conditions, whatever, give you sort of the most basic, those we, I think we can figure out what the possibilities are, right?

0:20:30	SPEAKER_06
 They're sort of relatively limited number.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_06
 And then how they interact with some extra thing like in France, or if such and such, that's like there are certain ways that they can, you know, one is a more specific version of the general pattern that the grammatical grammar gives you.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_06
 But, you know, whatever.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, in the short run, all we need is enough mechanism on the form side to get things going.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_05
 But the whole point of what Focundian Turner have to say about mental spaces and blending and all that stuff is that you don't really get that much out of the sentence.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_05
 You know, there's not that much information contained in the sentence that just says here, add the structure to the space.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_05
 And exactly what that means for the overall ongoing interpretation is quite open.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_05
 An individual sentence could mean a hundred different things depending on quote what the space configuration is at the time of utterance.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_05
 And so somebody's going to have to be doing a whole lot of work, but not me, I think.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's not, I don't think it's completely right.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, in fact, the sentence examples you gave, it did constrain the meaning, the form did constrain the meaning.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_02
 And so it isn't sure, but like what was the point of saying

0:21:47	SPEAKER_05
 that sentence about Nixon and France? That is not, there's nothing about that in the sentence.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_05
 That's like it usually don't know the point of it.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_06
 The sentence is all, but we know what it's trying to say.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_06
 We know what what predication is sending out.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_02
 But bottom line I agree with you that we're not expecting much out of the purely linguistic cues, right?

0:22:07	SPEAKER_02
 The purely formed cues.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_02
 And I mean, you're the linguist, but it seems to me that these, you know, we've talked about maybe half a dozen linguistics these these in the last few minutes or something.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_02
 Oh yeah.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_02
 And that's my feeling that these are really hard problems that decide exactly what's going on.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_06
 OK.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_06
 OK.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_06
 One other thing I just want to point out is there's a lot of confusion about the terms like profile, designate, focus, etc.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_06
 Right, right, right.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_06
 For now, I'm going to say like profiles often use like two uses that come to mind immediately.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_06
 One is in the traditional like semantic highlight of one element with respect to everything else.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_06
 So hypotenuse, you profile this guy against the background of the right triangle.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_06
 OK.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_06
 And the second use is in frame met.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_06
 It's slightly different.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_06
 And I was asking tons about this.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_06
 They use it to really mean this in a frame.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_06
 This is the profile element.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_06
 These are the ones that are required.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_06
 So they have to be there or expressed in some way, which, which nothing one and two are mutually exclusive, but they're different meanings.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_06
 So the closest thing, so I was thinking about how it relates to this notation for us.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_06
 OK, so how is it?

0:23:25	SPEAKER_02
 So does it really what they mean in frame met?

0:23:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I didn't know that.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, I was a little bit surprised about it.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_06
 I knew that I thought that that would be something like, there's another term that I've heard for that.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_06
 Well, at least Hans does use it that way.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_06
 Well, I'll check.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_06
 Anyway, so I think the designate that we have in terms of meaning is really the highlight this thing with respect to everything else.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_06
 OK, so this is what it means.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_06
 But the second one seems to be useful, but we might not need a notation for it.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_06
 We don't have a notation for it, but we might want one.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_06
 So for example, we've talked about, if you're talking about the electrical item walk, it's an action.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_06
 Well, it also has this idea.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_06
 Carries along with it the idea of an actor.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_06
 Everybody's going to do the walking.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_06
 Or if you talk about an adjective red, it carries along the idea of the thing that has a property of having color red.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_06
 So we used to use the notation with for this.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_06
 And I think that's closest to the second one.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_06
 So I don't yet know I have no commitment as to whether we need it.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_06
 It might be, it's kind of thing that parser might want to think about whether we require.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_06
 These things are like, it's semantically.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_02
 Critically, they're not required syntactically.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_02
 Often they're presuppose than all that sort of stuff.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_06
 Definitely.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_06
 So in, was a good example.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_06
 If you walk in, like, well, in what?

0:24:43	SPEAKER_06
 You know, like, what is that?

0:24:43	SPEAKER_06
 So it's only semantically is it?

0:24:45	SPEAKER_06
 It is still required, say, by simulation time, though, to have something.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_06
 So I meant the idea of that the semantic value is filled in by some, similar.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_06
 I don't know if that's something we need to say ever as part of the requirement, or the construction, or not, what will again, do for it.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, or have it construed, is that the point?

0:25:04	SPEAKER_06
 Point it, Robert.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_06
 Have you ever had a views of this point?

0:25:07	SPEAKER_04
 It's his thesis, right?

0:25:09	SPEAKER_02
 Anyway, right.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, this is going to be a good example of this a bit of the mess.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_02
 And we still have emphasis as well, or stress, or whatever.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_06
 OK, well, we'll get, we have thoughts about those, as well.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_06
 I would just say, some of this is just like my, you know, by feet, I'm going to say, this is how we use these terms.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_06
 I don't, you know, there's lots of these stories in the world that people use it.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_06
 I think that the other terms that are related are like focus and stress.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_06
 So I think that the way we would like to think about, I think, is focus is something that comes up in, I mean, lots of basic information structure.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_06
 OK, it's like, it's not.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_06
 It might be that there's a syntactic device that you use to indicate focus, or that there are things like, you know, I think you've been telling me things toward the end of the sentence, post-verbal, tend to be the focused, focused on the new information.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_06
 You know, if I, you know, I walked into the room, you tend to think that whatever into the room is sort of like the more focused kind of thing.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_06
 And when you, you have stress on something that might be, you know, a cue that the stressed element, or for instance, the negated element, is kind of related to information structure.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_06
 So that's like the new, the sort of like, import whatever of this thing.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_06
 So I think that's kind of nice to keep focused on being an information structure term.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_06
 Stress, I think, and then there are different kinds of focus that you can bring to it.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_06
 So like stress, the stress is kind of a pun on, and you might have like whatever, like accent kind of stress.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_06
 And that's just a, we want to stinger stress as a form device, you know, like, oh, high volume, or whatever.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_06
 And to stinger that from its effect, which is, oh, the kind of focus we have is we're emphasizing this value often as opposed to other values, right?

0:26:48	SPEAKER_06
 So focus carries along a scope.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_06
 Like if you're going to focus on this thing, and you want to know, it sort of evokes all the other possibilities that it wasn't.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_06
 So my classic, my now classic example of saying, oh, he did go to the meeting.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_06
 That was my way of saying, as opposed to, you know, oh, he didn't, or there was a meeting, I think that was the example it was caught on by the link with the immediate, and so the, like, if you said he, you know, there's all these different things that, if you put stress on different part of it, then you're focusing, whatever, on depending.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_06
 He walked to the meeting as opposed to he ran, or he did walk to the meeting as opposed to he didn't walk.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_06
 You know, so we need to have a notation for that, which I think that's still in progress, so it's sort of still working it out.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_06
 But it did, one implication it does have for the other side, which we'll get to in a minute, is that I couldn't think of a good way to say, here are the possible things that you could focus on, because it seems like any entity in any sentence, or any meaning component of anything, you know, all the possible meaning you could have, any of them could be the subject of focus.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_06
 But I think one thing you can't skimitize is the kind of focus, right?

0:27:51	SPEAKER_06
 So for instance, you could say it's the tense on this as opposed to the action, okay?

0:27:57	SPEAKER_06
 Or it's an identity thing, or contrast with other things, or stress as value as opposed to other things.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_06
 So it is sort of like profile background thing, but I can't think of like the limited set of possible meanings that you would, that you would, highlight, as opposed to other ones.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_06
 So it has some sort of complications for the later on.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, the best thing I come up with is that information structure has a list of focused elements.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_06
 For instance, one other type that I've mentioned is like query elements, and that's probably relevant for the, like where is, you know, the castle kind of thing, because you might wanna say that location, or certain WH words, bring, you know, sort of automatically, focus, you know, I don't know the identity of this thing kind of way on certain elements.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_06
 So, okay, anyway, so that's only, there are many more things that are, there's sort of like a little bit on stable other notation, but it's mostly, I think this is, you know, the current form, other things we didn't totally deal with.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_06
 Well, we have a lot of other stuff that you can have in working on in terms of like, how you deal with an adjective, you know, a nominal expression.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, we should put an example of this, and we could do that later.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_06
 But I think then, inherently, like the general principle still work though, that we can have constructions that have sort of constituent structure in that there is like, you know, for instance, one, you know, they have constituents, right?

0:29:28	SPEAKER_06
 So you can like nest things when you need to, but they can also overlap in a sort of flatter way.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_06
 So if you don't have like a lot of grammar extracts, like this might, you know, be a little, okay, but, you know, we have the properties of dependency grammars and some properties of constituents constituent based grammar.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_06
 So that's, I think that's the main thing we wanted to aim for.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_06
 And so far, it's worked out, okay.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_06
 Good.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_04
 I can say two things.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe you want to forget stress.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_04
 As a word?

0:29:59	SPEAKER_04
 No, as, as, just don't think about it.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_04
 Canonically speaking, you can, if you look at a curve or a sentence, you can find out where it's a certain stress is, and say, hey, that's my focus exponent.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't tell you anything what the focus is.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_04
 If it's just that thing, or the constituent that it pulls it.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_04
 Or the whole phrase.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_06
 You mean to forget about stress the form?

0:30:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because as a form cue, not even trained experts can always, well, they can tell you where the focus exponent is sometimes.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_04
 And that's also mostly true for red speech.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_04
 And real speech, people may put stress.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_04
 It's so the context dependent on what was there before, phrase-based breaks, restarts.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_04
 It's just, it's absurd.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_04
 It's complicated.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I mean, I'm sort of inclined to say, let's worry about specifying the information, the structure, focus of the sentence.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_05
 And then- Ways that you can get it.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_05
 The phonology component can handle actually assigning an intonation contour to that.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, later on, we'll worry about it.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_04
 I don't really contour to what the focus exactly is.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_04
 I'll figure out how the, yeah.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_04
 But if you don't know what your focus is, then your focus, you lost anyways.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_04
 And the only way of figuring out what that is is by sort of generating all the possible alternatives to each focused element, decide which one in that context makes sense of which one doesn't.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_04
 And then you left with a couple of three.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_04
 So, you know, again, that's something that humans can do.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_04
 But, paracetoscope, anything.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_04
 So-

0:31:58	SPEAKER_06
 OK. Well, yeah, I wouldn't have assumed that it's an easy problem in absence of all the, you need all the other information,

0:32:04	SPEAKER_04
 I guess. But it's pretty easy to put it in the formalism, though.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, because you can just say whatever stuff is the container being focused or the entire whatever, both, and so forth.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, exactly.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_06
 So the sort of effect of it is something we want to keep.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_02
 But I think, I'm not sure I understand, but here's what I think is going on.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_02
 That if we do the constructions right, when a particular construction matches, it, the fact that it matches does in fact specify the focus.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_06
 I'm not sure about that.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_06
 It certainly constrains the elements.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_06
 It's the very least.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_06
 That's certainly true.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_06
 And depending on the construction, it may or may not.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, for sure.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, there are, yeah, it's not every, but there are constructions where you explicitly take into account those considerations that you need to take into account in order to decide what is being focused.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_04
 So we talked about this morning.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_04
 John is on the bus.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_04
 Not Nancy.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_04
 Focus is on John.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_04
 John is on the bus and not on the train.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_04
 John is on the bus versus John is on the train.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_01
 John is on the bus.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_04
 John is on the bus.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_04
 All of those.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_04
 All of these.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_04
 And will we have, is it all the same constructions?

0:33:31	SPEAKER_04
 Just with a different one.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I would say that argument structure, in terms of like the main, sort of, I don't know, the fact that you can get it without any stress and you have some, whatever is predicated anyway, should be the same set of constructions.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_06
 That's why I was talking about overlapping constructions.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_06
 So then you have a separate thing that picks out, you know, stress on something relative to everything else.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_06
 So the question is actually, I'm sorry, go ahead.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_06
 And that would have to, it might be ambiguous as whether it picks out that element or the phrase or so on that, but it still is limited possibility.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_06
 So that should, you know, interact with, it should overlap with whatever other construction is.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_02
 The question is, do we have a way on the other page, when we get to this semantic side of saying what the stressed element was or stressed phrase or something?

0:34:16	SPEAKER_06
 So that's why I was saying how, since I couldn't think of an easy, like, limited way of doing it, all I can say is that information structure has a focus slot and I think that should be a little inferred.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_02
 So that's down at the bottom here when we get up.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, and I don't have a, I don't have a great way or great examples, but I think that's something like that is probably going to be more, more what we have to do.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, that was one comment.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, well, once you know what the focus is, the everything else is background.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_04
 How about topic command, it's the other side of, how about what?

0:34:47	SPEAKER_04
 topic command?

0:34:48	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, so that was the other thing.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_06
 So I didn't realize before, it's like, oh, I have a piphony that, you know, topic and focus are a contrast set.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_06
 So topic is, topic focus seems to me like background profile, okay, or landmark trajectory or something like that.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_06
 There's definitely that kind of thing going on.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_06
 I don't know whether, I don't have as many great examples of like topic indicating constructions on like focus, right?

0:35:15	SPEAKER_06
 Topic, it seems to kind of, you know, something that might be an ongoing kind of thing.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_05
 Japanese has this though, you know, yeah, that's what is, just to mark which thing is the topic, it doesn't always have to be the subject.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_06
 So again, information structure has a topics lot.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_06
 I stuck it in thinking that we might use it.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_06
 I guess I did.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_06
 Yep, it's there.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_06
 And one thing that I didn't do consistently is, when we get there, is like indicate what kind of thing fits into every role.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_06
 I think I have an idea of what should be, but there, you know, so far we've been getting away with like, either a type constraint or, you know, whatever, it'll be a frame, you know, it'll be, it'll be another predication or it'll be, I don't know, some value from something, some variable and scope or something like that.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_06
 Or a slot chain, please, not a variable.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, so that's, should we flip over to the other side, officially then?

0:36:02	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, side one.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_06
 Pointing forward to it, yeah.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_06
 Now, flip back step.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, so this doesn't include something which might, may have some effect on it, which is the, discourse situation context record.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_06
 Right, so I did, I meant just like draw line and like, you know, you also have some tracking of what was going on.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_06
 And sort of, this is a big spell comment before I, you know, look into the details of this.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_06
 But for instance, you can imagine instead of having, I changed the name of, I used to be entities, so you can see it's scenario, reference and discourse segment.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_06
 And scenario is essentially what kind of, what's the basic predication, what event happened?

0:36:41	SPEAKER_06
 And actually it's just a list of various slots from which you would draw, draw in order to paint your picture, bunch of frames by, and findings, right?

0:36:49	SPEAKER_06
 And obviously there are other ones that are not included here, general, cultural frames in general, like, other action, you know, specific X-key maverings, okay, whatever.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_06
 The middle thing used to be entities, because you could imagine it should be like, really a list where here was various information.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_06
 And this is intended to be grammatically specifiable information about a reference, you know, about some entity that you were going to talk about.

0:37:12	SPEAKER_06
 So Harry walked into the room, Harry and room, you know, the room, but they'd be represented in this list somehow.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_06
 And it could also have, for instance, has this category slot, should be either category in more instance, basically, could be a point or terminology, so that everything you know about this could be drawn.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_06
 But the important things for grammatical purposes are things like number, gender.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_06
 The ones I included here are slightly arbitrary, but you could imagine that you need to figure out whether, if it's a group, whether some event is happening linear time, linear space, is like, you know, are they doing something serially, or is it like, I'm not sure, this partly came from a Tommi's schema, I'm not sure we'll need all of these actually, but, and then the status I used was like, again, in some languages, you know, like, for instance, in the child language, you might distinguish between different status.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_06
 So the big, and finally, discourse segment is about, sort of, bejack the information structure, like utterance specific kinds of things.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_06
 So the common I was going to make about changing entity, the entity's block to reference is that, you can imagine your discourse, so like situation context, you have a set of entities that you're sort of referring to, and you might, that might be your general, I don't know, database of all the things in this discourse that you could refer to, and I changed a reference because I would say, for a particular utterance, you have particular referring expressions in it, and those are the ones that you get information about that you stick in here.

0:38:40	SPEAKER_06
 For instance, I know it's going to be plural, I know it's going to be feminine, or something like that.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_06
 And these could actually just point to, you know, the ID in my other list of active entities, right?

0:38:53	SPEAKER_06
 So there's all this stuff about discourse status, we've talked about, I almost listed discourse status as a slot where you could say it's active, you know, there's this hierarchy, there's a schemingization of, you know, things can be active, or they can be accessible, inaccessible, there's someone that, you know, keep email to us once, do some of us not a while.

0:39:14	SPEAKER_06
 And the thing is that that, I noticed that that list was sort of discourse dependence, like in this particular set instance, it has been referred to recently, or it hasn't been, or this is something that's left in my world knowledge, but not active.

0:39:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, there seems to be context properties.

0:39:30	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, and for instance, I used to have a location thing there, but actually that's a property of the situation, and again, at certain points, things are located near or far away.

0:39:40	SPEAKER_02
 Well, this is recursive, because until we do the mental space story, we're not quite sure, which is fine.

0:39:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so some of these are.

0:39:50	SPEAKER_06
 We just don't know yet.

0:39:52	SPEAKER_06
 So for now, I thought, well, maybe I'll just have in this list the things that are relevant to this particular utterance, right, everything else here is utterant specific.

0:40:02	SPEAKER_06
 And I left this slot, predications open, because you can have things like the guy I know from school, or you're referring a fashion might be constrained by certain unbounded amounts of predications that you might make.

0:40:18	SPEAKER_06
 And it's unclear whether, I mean, you could just have in your scenarios, here are some extra few things that are true, right?

0:40:25	SPEAKER_06
 And then you could just sort of not have this slot here.

0:40:30	SPEAKER_06
 But it's used for identification purposes.

0:40:31	SPEAKER_06
 It's a little bit different just saying all these things are true from my other.

0:40:37	SPEAKER_05
 Right, this guy I know from school came for dinner.

0:40:39	SPEAKER_05
 Does not mean there is a guy I know him from school and he came over for dinner.

0:40:46	SPEAKER_05
 It's not the same.

0:40:47	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, it's a little bit different, right?

0:40:49	SPEAKER_06
 So maybe that's like the restrictive non-restrictive.

0:40:52	SPEAKER_06
 You know, it gets into that kind of thing.

0:40:55	SPEAKER_06
 But maybe I'm mixing, you know, this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence.

0:41:01	SPEAKER_06
 So you might imagine that the information you passed to, you know, identifying a particular reference would be, oh, it's a guy and it's someone I know from school.

0:41:09	SPEAKER_06
 So maybe that would be sort of intermediate structure that you would pass into the disc, to whatever a continual engine or whatever discos context to find, you know, either create this reference, in which case it would be created here.

0:41:21	SPEAKER_06
 And you know, so you can imagine that this might not.

0:41:23	SPEAKER_06
 So I uncommitted to a couple of these things.

0:41:28	SPEAKER_04
 I just make it pretty much at least in my mind, this is not too much.

0:41:32	SPEAKER_04
 So how is gender looter?

0:41:37	SPEAKER_02
 In reality?

0:41:37	SPEAKER_06
 It could be in semantically.

0:41:40	SPEAKER_06
 Semantically, yeah.

0:41:42	SPEAKER_06
 So a table, you know, I think.

0:41:47	SPEAKER_06
 It doesn't have a gender or so.

0:41:49	SPEAKER_06
 It could be that, I mean, maybe not all of these.

0:41:53	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, I would say that I tried to keep lots of you that were potentially relevant to most things.

0:41:58	SPEAKER_04
 Just to make sure that everybody that we read the question.

0:42:01	SPEAKER_04
 OK, that is semantic as opposed to.

0:42:03	SPEAKER_04
 It has nothing to do with warm.

0:42:05	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, that's right.

0:42:11	SPEAKER_04
 So again, that purification makes sense to have it open before something like an extreme.

0:42:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, not.

0:42:19	SPEAKER_06
 OK, so let's see.

0:42:21	SPEAKER_06
 So maybe having made that big scale, sort of like large scale comment, should I just go through each of these slots, each of these blocks a little bit.

0:42:33	SPEAKER_06
 Mostly the top one is sort of image schematic.

0:42:36	SPEAKER_06
 And just a note, which is that when we actually have some of them seem more inherently static, like a container or sort of support dish.

0:42:50	SPEAKER_06
 And others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic, like source path goal, is often thought of that way, or force or something like that.

0:42:57	SPEAKER_06
 But in actual fact, I think that they're intended to be sort of neutral with respect to that.

0:43:03	SPEAKER_06
 And different ex-chemists use them in a way that's either static or dynamic.

0:43:07	SPEAKER_06
 So path, you could just be talking about the path between this and this and container.

0:43:11	SPEAKER_06
 And then you go in and out all these things.

0:43:12	SPEAKER_06
 So I think this came up when Ben and I were working with the Spaniards on the other day.

0:43:19	SPEAKER_06
 Spaniards, this is what we built them, to decide how you want to split up image schematic contributions versus ex-chematic contributions and how you link them up.

0:43:28	SPEAKER_06
 And I think again, it's going to be something in the ex-chemist that tells you is a static or a system.

0:43:33	SPEAKER_06
 So we definitely need that sort of a spectral type gives you some of that.

0:43:38	SPEAKER_06
 Is it a state or is it a change of state or is it an action of some kind?

0:43:45	SPEAKER_04
 Is there any meaning to where you have sort of parameters behind it and when you don't?

0:43:51	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, you mean in the slot?

0:43:53	SPEAKER_06
 No, it's like I was thinking of type constraints.

0:43:56	SPEAKER_06
 But ex-chemist obviously has been ex-chemist.

0:43:58	SPEAKER_06
 Agents, I mean, the performer of the ex-chemist, that depends on the ex-chemist.

0:44:02	SPEAKER_06
 In general, probably, the...

0:44:04	SPEAKER_05
 So the difference is basically whether you thought it was obvious what the possible filler is for.

0:44:08	SPEAKER_06
 Basically, as a spectral type probably isn't obvious, but I should have.

0:44:10	SPEAKER_06
 So I just neglected the sticks and things.

0:44:12	SPEAKER_06
 Perspective actor, underwear, observer.

0:44:15	SPEAKER_06
 I think we've often used...

0:44:16	SPEAKER_06
 Wee!

0:44:17	SPEAKER_06
 That's that one, right?

0:44:19	SPEAKER_06
 Exactly.

0:44:20	SPEAKER_06
 And so one nice thing that we had talked about is this example.

0:44:24	SPEAKER_06
 If you have a passive construction, then one thing it does is definitely, it is one way for you to specifically take the perspective of the undergoing kind of object.

0:44:35	SPEAKER_06
 And so then we talked about whether, well, does that specify a topic as well?

0:44:40	SPEAKER_06
 Well, maybe there are other things.

0:44:41	SPEAKER_06
 Now that it's subject, it's more like a topic.

0:44:43	SPEAKER_06
 And now that...

0:44:44	SPEAKER_06
 Anyway, so I'm going to trail off on that one so it's not that important right now.

0:44:48	SPEAKER_02
 No, for the moment, we just need the ability to write it down.

0:44:53	SPEAKER_02
 If somebody figured out what the rules were.

0:44:55	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, exactly.

0:44:57	SPEAKER_06
 Some of these other ones, let's see.

0:44:58	SPEAKER_06
 So one thing I'm uncertain about is how polarity interacts.

0:45:03	SPEAKER_06
 So polarity is using...

0:45:04	SPEAKER_06
 For like action did not take place, for instance.

0:45:07	SPEAKER_06
 So by default, it'll be like true, I guess.

0:45:10	SPEAKER_06
 If you're specifying events, it did happen.

0:45:13	SPEAKER_06
 You could imagine that you skip out this.

0:45:15	SPEAKER_06
 Leave off this polarity, don't have it here.

0:45:19	SPEAKER_06
 And then have it part of the speech act in some way, in some negation.

0:45:22	SPEAKER_06
 But the reason why I left it is, because you might have a change of state, let's say, where some state holds and then some state doesn't hold.

0:45:29	SPEAKER_06
 And you're just talking, you know, if you're trying to have the nuts bolt of simulation, you need to know that whatever.

0:45:33	SPEAKER_06
 No, I think this level, which is where you have it.

0:45:37	SPEAKER_06
 OK, so it's fine where it is.

0:45:39	SPEAKER_06
 So how do you get it?

0:45:40	SPEAKER_02
 It may blow off and involve the discourse.

0:45:43	SPEAKER_02
 But by the time you're simulating, you should know that.

0:45:47	SPEAKER_05
 So I'm still just really not clear on what I'm looking at, the scenario box.

0:45:53	SPEAKER_05
 Like, what does that look like for an example?

0:45:56	SPEAKER_05
 Like, not all of these things are going to be here.

0:45:58	SPEAKER_05
 This is just basically says...

0:46:00	SPEAKER_05
 It's a grab bag.

0:46:01	SPEAKER_05
 Part of what I'm going to hand you is a whole bunch of schemas, image and ex schemas.

0:46:08	SPEAKER_05
 Here are some examples of the sorts of things you might have in there.

0:46:11	SPEAKER_06
 So that's exactly what it is.

0:46:12	SPEAKER_06
 OK.

0:46:13	SPEAKER_06
 And for a particular instance, which I make an example of that, is that you might have an instance of container and path, let's say, as part of your into definition.

0:46:26	SPEAKER_06
 So you would eventually have instances filled in with various values for all the different slots.

0:46:32	SPEAKER_06
 And they're bound up.

0:46:33	SPEAKER_06
 And yeah, they're bindings.

0:46:34	SPEAKER_05
 OK.

0:46:35	SPEAKER_05
 Do you have to say about the binding in your...

0:46:37	SPEAKER_05
 Is there a slot in here for the tells you how the bindings are done?

0:46:40	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no.

0:46:41	SPEAKER_02
 Let's say I think we're not... another way of quite right yet.

0:46:43	SPEAKER_02
 So what this is, let's suppose for the moment it's complete.

0:46:49	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:46:49	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:46:50	SPEAKER_02
 Then this says that when an analysis is finished, the whole analysis is finished, you'll have, as a result, some spec for that utterance and context, which is made up entirely of these things and bindings among them and bindings to ontology items.

0:47:19	SPEAKER_02
 So that this is the toolkit out of which you can make a semantic specification.

0:47:30	SPEAKER_02
 So that's A. But D, which is more relevant to your life, is this is also the toolkit that is used in the semantic side of constructions.

0:47:41	SPEAKER_02
 So this is...

0:47:43	SPEAKER_02
 And anything you have in the party line, anything you have a semantic side of construction comes from pieces this, ignoring a lot...

0:47:52	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, in general, you ignore lots of it.

0:47:54	SPEAKER_02
 But it's got to be pieces of this along with constraints among them so that the goal of the...

0:48:03	SPEAKER_02
 a sort of that goal has to be the landmark of the interior, the container, or whatever.

0:48:10	SPEAKER_02
 So those constraints appear in constructions.

0:48:15	SPEAKER_02
 But pretty much this is the full range of semantic structures available to you.

0:48:24	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:48:25	SPEAKER_02
 For a cause.

0:48:26	SPEAKER_06
 Thank you.

0:48:26	SPEAKER_06
 Anyway, some kind of causal structure.

0:48:29	SPEAKER_02
 OK, good.

0:48:29	SPEAKER_02
 Let's mark that.

0:48:31	SPEAKER_02
 So we need to...

0:48:32	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, so it gets a little bit funny.

0:48:34	SPEAKER_06
 These are all so far with these structures, especially from path and on down.

0:48:37	SPEAKER_06
 These are sort of relatively familiar image schematic kind of slots.

0:48:42	SPEAKER_06
 Now, with cause, the fillers will actually be the cell strings.

0:48:46	SPEAKER_06
 So you'll say event one causes meant B.

0:48:49	SPEAKER_02
 And this again may get...

0:48:53	SPEAKER_02
 And of course, worlds.

0:48:55	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:48:55	SPEAKER_06
 So these are all implicitly within one role, even though saying that place takes place, whatever, if I said time is passed, that would say set this world somewhere before the world that corresponds to a current speech time.

0:49:11	SPEAKER_06
 So that's sort of OK.

0:49:14	SPEAKER_06
 Within the event, it's still one role.

0:49:18	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, so cause and other frames that could come in.

0:49:21	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, unfortunately, you could bring in, say, for instance, a desire or something that I kind of want.

0:49:27	SPEAKER_06
 And actually, there is right now under discourse segment that's attitude, volition, could fill that.

0:49:35	SPEAKER_06
 There are a couple things where I'm like, oh, not sure if I want to have there.

0:49:39	SPEAKER_06
 Or basically, there was a whole list of possible speaker attitudes that, say, told me listed.

0:49:44	SPEAKER_06
 I'm like, well, I don't know.

0:49:45	SPEAKER_06
 It was like hope, wish, desire, blah, blah, blah.

0:49:49	SPEAKER_06
 And so I'm like, well, I feel like if I wanted to have an extra meaning, I don't know if those are grammatically marked in the first place.

0:49:54	SPEAKER_06
 They're more lexically marked, right?

0:49:56	SPEAKER_06
 At least in English.

0:49:57	SPEAKER_06
 So if I wanted to, I would stick in an extra frame, in my meaning saying, so there would be a hierarchical frame that, you know, like Naomi wants such a certain situation.

0:50:06	SPEAKER_06
 And that situation itself is a state of affairs.

0:50:09	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:50:09	SPEAKER_02
 So want itself can be.

0:50:11	SPEAKER_02
 It can be just another frame.

0:50:13	SPEAKER_02
 Well, basically, it's an action in our situation.

0:50:18	SPEAKER_02
 In our terminology, one could be an action in what you want is a world.

0:50:24	SPEAKER_02
 So that's, I mean, it's certainly one way to do it.

0:50:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, there are other things, causal stuff we absolutely need, the mental space we need, the context we need.

0:50:34	SPEAKER_02
 So anyway, Keith, so is this comfortable to you that once we have this defined, it is your toolkit for building the semantic part of constructions.

0:50:51	SPEAKER_02
 And then when we combine constructions semantically, the goal is going to be to fill out more and more of the bindings needed in order to come up with the final one.

0:51:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:51:02	SPEAKER_02
 And that's the, I mean, according to the party line, that's the whole story.

0:51:08	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:51:10	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:51:11	SPEAKER_05
 That makes sense.

0:51:11	SPEAKER_05
 So I mean, there's this stuff in the, up in the scenario, which just tells you how various what's gave us you're using in our Heather bound together.

0:51:18	SPEAKER_05
 And I guess that some of the discourse segment stuff, is that where you would, I mean, that's, OK, that's where the information structure is, which sort of is a kind of profiling on different parts of this.

0:51:32	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, what's interesting is that the information structure is stuff.

0:51:38	SPEAKER_05
 There's almost, I mean, we keep coming back to how focus is like this, this trajectory landmark thing.

0:51:44	SPEAKER_05
 So if I say, in France, it's like this.

0:51:49	SPEAKER_05
 Great.

0:51:49	SPEAKER_05
 We've learned something about France, but the fact is that utterances of that sort are generally used to help you draw conclusion also about some implicit contrast.

0:51:59	SPEAKER_05
 Like in France, it's like this.

0:52:00	SPEAKER_05
 And therefore, you're supposed to say, boy, like sure, you know, in France, kids are allowed to drink at age three.

0:52:04	SPEAKER_05
 And that's not just the fact about France.

0:52:07	SPEAKER_05
 You also can do something about how boring it is here in the US.

0:52:10	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:52:10	SPEAKER_05
 And so.

0:52:12	SPEAKER_06
 So I would prefer not to worry about that for right now.

0:52:15	SPEAKER_06
 OK.

0:52:15	SPEAKER_06
 And to think that there are, that comes in.

0:52:18	SPEAKER_06
 This first level constructions, in a sense, topic, focus constructions that would say, oh, when you focus something, then just in the same way, just actually, in the same way, it's the lower level.

0:52:27	SPEAKER_06
 If you stressed, you know, John went to the bar, whatever.

0:52:31	SPEAKER_06
 You're focusing that and it's possible in France is in contrast to other things.

0:52:34	SPEAKER_06
 So similarly, for a whole sentence, in France, such and such happens.

0:52:38	SPEAKER_06
 So the whole thing is sort of like, again, implicitly, as opposed to other things that are possible.

0:52:43	SPEAKER_04
 So just look at the same formal maths route.

0:52:49	SPEAKER_04
 It's nice to just pick any paper on alternatively.

0:52:54	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:52:55	SPEAKER_04
 So that's the best way of talking about focus.

0:52:59	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's the way.

0:53:01	SPEAKER_05
 OK.

0:53:02	SPEAKER_05
 What was the name?

0:53:03	SPEAKER_04
 M-A-T-S.

0:53:06	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:53:06	SPEAKER_04
 Rooft.

0:53:08	SPEAKER_04
 T2O.

0:53:09	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:53:09	SPEAKER_04
 T-H.

0:53:11	SPEAKER_04
 I never know what you're going to know, so it's not.

0:53:13	SPEAKER_04
 Because it's sweet.

0:53:16	SPEAKER_04
 E-Dutch.

0:53:17	SPEAKER_04
 Dutch?

0:53:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:53:19	SPEAKER_04
 And very confused by the way.

0:53:23	None
 So.

0:53:24	SPEAKER_05
 And maths route.

0:53:26	SPEAKER_04
 It's had enough.

0:53:27	SPEAKER_04
 You also just left the IMS in Stuttgart.

0:53:29	SPEAKER_04
 So it's not there anymore.

0:53:32	SPEAKER_04
 But I don't know where you said now.

0:53:34	SPEAKER_04
 But alternative semantics.

0:53:36	SPEAKER_04
 So you type that into a browser search list.

0:53:39	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:53:39	SPEAKER_04
 And you get that.

0:53:41	SPEAKER_05
 OK.

0:53:41	SPEAKER_05
 Thanks.

0:53:46	SPEAKER_04
 And what I'm kind of confused about is this.

0:53:48	SPEAKER_04
 What's the speaker and the hearers?

0:53:50	SPEAKER_04
 This is what I'm doing here.

0:53:53	SPEAKER_06
 So for a particular segment, it's really just a reference to some other entity, again, in the situation.

0:54:01	SPEAKER_06
 So for a particular segment, the speaker might be you or might be me.

0:54:05	SPEAKER_06
 Here is a little bit harder.

0:54:07	SPEAKER_06
 It could be like multiple people.

0:54:08	SPEAKER_06
 I guess that that's not very clear for me.

0:54:11	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, that's not clear.

0:54:12	SPEAKER_04
 Don't we ultimately want to handle that analogously in the way we handle time and space?

0:54:19	SPEAKER_04
 Because you, me, he, they, these guys, all these expressions are much, say, we're contextually dependent as here and now and there.

0:54:30	SPEAKER_02
 You know, this is assuming you've already solved that.

0:54:32	SPEAKER_02
 So it's Fred and Mary.

0:54:34	SPEAKER_02
 So the speaker would be Fred and the.

0:54:38	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:54:38	SPEAKER_06
 So the constructions, of course, will refer using pronouns or whatever.

0:54:43	SPEAKER_06
 In which case, they have to check to see who the speaker in here would in order to resolve those.

0:54:49	SPEAKER_06
 But when you actually say that he walked into whatever, he will refer to a particular.

0:54:55	SPEAKER_06
 You will already figure out who he or you or I, maybe a better example, who I refers to.

0:55:02	SPEAKER_06
 And then you just be able to refer to Harry, in wherever that person, whatever role that person was playing in the event.

0:55:08	SPEAKER_06
 That's up at the reference.

0:55:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:55:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:55:10	SPEAKER_04
 And don't there in this speaker here apart?

0:55:13	SPEAKER_06
 So that's, I think that's just, for instance, speaker is known from the situation.

0:55:21	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:55:21	SPEAKER_06
 When you hear something, you're told that the speaker is.

0:55:24	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, you know who the speaker is.

0:55:25	SPEAKER_06
 In fact, that's kind of constraining how, in some ways, you know this before you get to the, you feel in all the rest of it.

0:55:33	SPEAKER_06
 I think.

0:55:35	SPEAKER_06
 All right.

0:55:36	SPEAKER_06
 How else would you?

0:55:37	SPEAKER_06
 Very.

0:55:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:55:39	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I hear.

0:55:40	SPEAKER_04
 In the English, it's about to say, I.

0:55:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:55:43	SPEAKER_04
 I'm on the 25% level.

0:55:45	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, wouldn't the eye then set up the reference?

0:55:50	SPEAKER_04
 It happens to be the speaker of the type of number.

0:55:52	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:55:53	SPEAKER_04
 They, whoever they are, you.

0:55:55	SPEAKER_04
 Much like the you.

0:55:57	SPEAKER_06
 So, OK.

0:55:57	SPEAKER_06
 So I would say, under reference would be something that corresponds to eye.

0:56:00	SPEAKER_06
 And maybe each reference should probably have a list of whatever the way it was referred to.

0:56:04	SPEAKER_06
 So that's eye, but it should be say, it refers to what?

0:56:10	SPEAKER_06
 If it were Harry, it would refer to like some ontology thing.

0:56:11	SPEAKER_06
 If it were, if it's eye, it would refer to the current speaker, OK, which is given to be like, you know, whatever it is.

0:56:19	SPEAKER_04
 Not always.

0:56:21	SPEAKER_04
 And then he said, I.

0:56:22	SPEAKER_06
 Within the current world.

0:56:23	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:56:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:56:25	SPEAKER_02
 So, again, this is going to get us into the mental space stuff.

0:56:28	SPEAKER_02
 And because Fred said that Mary said in whatever.

0:56:32	SPEAKER_02
 And so we're going to have to chain those as well.

0:56:40	SPEAKER_06
 So this entire thing is inside a world.

0:56:46	SPEAKER_06
 Not just like the top part.

0:56:48	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's a bit of a problem.

0:56:54	SPEAKER_02
 Except it's trickier than that because the reference, for example, is where it gets really tricky.

0:57:05	None
 Yeah.

0:57:05	SPEAKER_02
 Is there some things, and this is where blends and all terapathy, you know, some things which really are meant to be identified in some things which aren't.

0:57:15	SPEAKER_02
 And again, all we need for the moment is some way to say that.

0:57:21	SPEAKER_06
 So I thought I'd have like for each referendum having the list of other things, which is identified.

0:57:27	SPEAKER_06
 You know, which you could do that.

0:57:28	SPEAKER_06
 You, for instance.

0:57:30	SPEAKER_06
 So I guess it sort of depends on if it is referring to the fits identifiable already or if it's a new thing.

0:57:37	SPEAKER_06
 If it's a new thing, you have to create a structure or whatever.

0:57:40	SPEAKER_06
 If it's old thing, it could be referring to usually something in a situation or something in ontology.

0:57:46	SPEAKER_06
 So there's a, you know, whatever.

0:57:49	SPEAKER_02
 I just had an idea that would be very nice if it works.

0:57:53	SPEAKER_02
 Or what?

0:57:53	SPEAKER_02
 It works.

0:57:54	SPEAKER_02
 I even told you what it is.

0:57:55	SPEAKER_02
 It just was mine.

0:57:57	SPEAKER_02
 Build up.

0:57:58	SPEAKER_02
 An idea that would be nice.

0:57:59	SPEAKER_02
 We're crossing our fingers.

0:58:00	SPEAKER_03
 If it works.

0:58:01	SPEAKER_03
 The billion mental space.

0:58:02	SPEAKER_03
 Good.

0:58:03	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:58:03	SPEAKER_03
 It was a space builder.

0:58:07	SPEAKER_02
 We might be able to handle context in the same way that we handle mental spaces.

0:58:14	SPEAKER_02
 Because you have somewhat the same things going on of things being accessible or not.

0:58:22	SPEAKER_02
 And so I think if we did it right, we might be able to get at least a lot of the same structure.

0:58:32	SPEAKER_02
 So pulling something out of a discourse context is, I think, similar to other kinds of mental space.

0:58:44	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I've never seen anybody write that up.

0:58:48	SPEAKER_02
 And maybe they did.

0:58:48	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:58:49	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe all of the literature.

0:58:51	SPEAKER_05
 So there's things like, there's all kinds of stuff like in, I think I mentioned last time, in check if you have a verb of saying, then you say something like, or of thinking you can say something like, oh, I thought you are a Republican or something like that.

0:59:10	SPEAKER_05
 Whereas in English, you would say, I thought you were.

0:59:13	SPEAKER_05
 Sort of the past tense being copied onto the lower verb doesn't happen there.

0:59:17	SPEAKER_05
 So you have to say something about tense is determined relative to current blah, blah, blah.

0:59:22	SPEAKER_05
 The same thing happens with pronouns.

0:59:24	SPEAKER_05
 There's languages where if you have a verb of saying, then OK, so a situation like Bob said he was going to the movies where that lower subject is the same as the person who is saying or thinking.

0:59:39	SPEAKER_05
 You're actually required to have I there.

0:59:43	SPEAKER_05
 And it's sort of an extended approach.

0:59:45	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:59:45	SPEAKER_05
 But it's not perceived as a quotative construction.

0:59:48	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, it's been analyzed by the formalist as being a logophoric pronoun, which means a pronoun which refers back to the person who is speaking, or that sort of thing.

0:59:59	SPEAKER_05
 But that happens to sound like the word for I, but is actually semantically unrelated to it.

1:00:04	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, good.

1:00:05	SPEAKER_05
 I love the formalist.

1:00:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

1:00:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

1:00:08	SPEAKER_05
 Kidding.

1:00:09	SPEAKER_05
 There's a whole book which basically operates on this assumption, Mary Del Rinpoel, this book, 93 book on pronouns stuff.

1:00:19	SPEAKER_05
 Well, yeah.

1:00:20	SPEAKER_05
 And then same thing for ASL, where you're signing.

1:00:22	SPEAKER_05
 And someone says something.

1:00:23	SPEAKER_05
 And then so he say, and then you sort of do a role shift.

1:00:27	SPEAKER_05
 And then you sign, I, this, that, and the other.

1:00:30	SPEAKER_05
 I did this.

1:00:31	SPEAKER_05
 That's also been analyzed as logophoric and having nothing to do with I.

1:00:35	SPEAKER_05
 And the role shift thing has completely left out and so on.

1:00:38	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, the point is that pronoun reference is sort of ties in with all this mental space stuff and so on and so forth.

1:00:45	SPEAKER_02
 So yeah.

1:00:46	SPEAKER_02
 So that does sound like consistent with what we're saying.

1:00:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

1:00:50	SPEAKER_06
 OK.

1:00:51	SPEAKER_06
 So it's kind of like the unspecified mental spaces just are current context.

1:00:54	SPEAKER_06
 And then when you embed them, sometimes you have to pop up to the, you know, depending on the construction or whatever.

1:01:01	SPEAKER_06
 Your scope might re-extend out to the base one.

1:01:05	SPEAKER_06
 It would be nice to actually use the same mechanism.

1:01:08	SPEAKER_06
 Since there are so many cases where you actually need, it'll be one or the other.

1:01:12	SPEAKER_06
 It's like, oh, actually it's the same.

1:01:13	SPEAKER_05
 OK.

1:01:13	SPEAKER_05
 So this is where it's like what's happening.

1:01:16	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

1:01:16	SPEAKER_05
 What's happening there is that you're moving the base space, something like that, right?

1:01:20	SPEAKER_05
 So that's how we're going to talk about it.

1:01:22	SPEAKER_05
 And it happens under different circumstances and different languages.

1:01:25	SPEAKER_05
 So things like pronoun reference and tense, which we're thinking of as being these discoursey things, actually, are relative to a base space, which can change.

1:01:32	SPEAKER_05
 And we need all the same machinery.

1:01:34	SPEAKER_05
 OK.

1:01:35	None
 OK.

1:01:36	SPEAKER_02
 Well, this is very good, actually, because it's an extent that it works.

1:01:43	SPEAKER_02
 Ties together several of these things.

1:01:46	SPEAKER_04
 And I'm sure going to read the transcript of this one.

1:01:50	SPEAKER_04
 But the, let's comment that we don't have a camera.

1:01:54	SPEAKER_04
 You know, all the partings.

1:01:55	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah.

1:01:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

1:01:58	SPEAKER_03
 Every time Nancy giggles it means that it's your job.

1:02:03	SPEAKER_04
 Listen, I mean, I was sort of dubious why he even introduces this sort of reality as your basic space in Androidism.

1:02:15	SPEAKER_04
 Doesn't start with something because it's so obvious.

1:02:18	SPEAKER_04
 It should be so obvious.

1:02:19	SPEAKER_04
 It's to me that whenever I say something, I could grab this that with, I think.

1:02:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:02:25	SPEAKER_04
 So there should be no pedagogical difference between you.

1:02:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:02:30	SPEAKER_04
 And all the others.

1:02:32	SPEAKER_02
 But there's a grisly thing going on there that when you say, I think you're actually hedging.

1:02:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

1:02:38	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, I don't totally think.

1:02:40	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

1:02:42	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I usually think.

1:02:44	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it's an evidential.

1:02:46	SPEAKER_05
 It's sort of semi-grammaticalized.

1:02:47	SPEAKER_05
 People have talked about it this way.

1:02:49	SPEAKER_05
 And you can do sort of special things.

1:02:51	SPEAKER_05
 You can put just the phrase, I think, as a parenthetical in the middle of sense and so on.

1:02:55	SPEAKER_05
 I actually wanted the child on the researchers who

1:02:57	SPEAKER_06
 worked with Homosolo study a bunch of these constructions. And it was like, it's not using any kind of interesting embedded ways just to mark uncertainty or something like that.

1:03:06	SPEAKER_04
 So.

1:03:07	SPEAKER_04
 About linguistic hedges, I mean, those tend to be quite the anyways because we don't have that in here either doing.

1:03:16	SPEAKER_02
 Hedges?

1:03:17	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

1:03:19	SPEAKER_06
 There used to be a slot for speaker.

1:03:22	SPEAKER_06
 There's something like activity.

1:03:24	SPEAKER_06
 I couldn't remember what it meant.

1:03:25	SPEAKER_06
 So it took me.

1:03:25	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

1:03:26	SPEAKER_05
 Well, we were just talking about this sort of evidentiality and stuff like that, right?

1:03:30	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, that's what I think is sort of telling you.

1:03:34	SPEAKER_05
 So we probably should have the scent reality or should give this or, you know, confidence or something.

1:03:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

1:03:40	SPEAKER_05
 And the fact that I'm, you know, the fact maybe if I think it versus key things that might, you know, depend on how much you trust the two of us or whatever.

1:03:48	SPEAKER_04
 You know, you're right.

1:03:49	SPEAKER_04
 We're in the English language, but about what the study help people use it.

1:03:53	SPEAKER_04
 What's the word about?

1:03:54	SPEAKER_04
 About.

1:03:55	SPEAKER_04
 It's about.

1:03:57	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, that use of about that.

1:04:00	SPEAKER_02
 I think I think if you want to spend the plus and six or seven hours, you can get George started on that.

1:04:08	SPEAKER_05
 You wrote a paper about 35 years ago on that one.

1:04:10	SPEAKER_03
 I read that paper.

1:04:11	SPEAKER_03
 The head just paper.

1:04:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

1:04:12	SPEAKER_03
 I read some of that paper, actually.

1:04:14	SPEAKER_05
 Would you believe that paper led directly to the development of anti-lock breaks?

1:04:19	SPEAKER_05
 No.

1:04:20	SPEAKER_05
 Ask me about it later.

1:04:22	SPEAKER_05
 I'll tell you how.

1:04:23	SPEAKER_05
 When we're not on time.

1:04:27	SPEAKER_05
 I'd love to know.

1:04:31	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, man.

1:04:32	SPEAKER_06
 So I think someone had raised like sarcasm.

1:04:36	SPEAKER_02
 It was all that stuff.

1:04:38	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think.

1:04:38	SPEAKER_06
 I think we just won't deal with sarcasm.

1:04:41	SPEAKER_05
 I don't really know why.

1:04:44	SPEAKER_05
 We don't have to care too much about the speaker attitude, right?

1:04:46	SPEAKER_05
 Like there's not so many different.

1:04:50	SPEAKER_06
 I know.

1:04:51	SPEAKER_06
 Well, there are international markers, I think,

1:04:53	SPEAKER_05
 that was part. I don't know.

1:04:55	SPEAKER_05
 I just mean.

1:04:55	SPEAKER_06
 So much about the grammatical.

1:04:58	SPEAKER_05
 There's lots of different attitudes that the speaker could have, and then we can clearly identify and tone and so forth.

1:05:03	SPEAKER_05
 But what are the distinctions among those that we actually care about for our current purposes?

1:05:09	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

1:05:09	SPEAKER_02
 So this was the first question of what are our current purposes.

1:05:13	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, shoot.

1:05:14	SPEAKER_05
 Here it is 315 already.

1:05:18	SPEAKER_02
 So I don't know the answer, but it does seem that this is coming along.

1:05:27	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's as far as I can tell, there's one major thing we have to do, which is the mental whole, spindle space thing.

1:05:34	SPEAKER_02
 And then there's some other minor things.

1:05:37	SPEAKER_02
 And we're going to have to sort of bound the complexity.

1:05:40	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, if you get everything that anybody ever thought about, you know, we're going to have to.

1:05:43	SPEAKER_02
 So we had started with the idea that the actual constraint was related to this tourist domain.

1:05:57	SPEAKER_02
 And the kinds of interactions that might occur in the tourist domain, assuming that people were being helpful and weren't trying to do.

1:06:05	SPEAKER_02
 You know, there's all sorts of cognitive irony.

1:06:08	SPEAKER_02
 And so like what you mean, isn't probably as much use in dealing with a tourist guide.

1:06:14	None
 Lockery.

1:06:15	SPEAKER_02
 So no end of things that we don't deal with.

1:06:21	SPEAKER_02
 And go ahead.

1:06:22	SPEAKER_04
 This is not easy, though, because in terms of the sum figure, which is mean you put one more set of brackets around it, just to sort of negate whatever.

1:06:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:06:32	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to have to see if I can go around your.

1:06:34	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

1:06:35	SPEAKER_06
 Maybe.

1:06:35	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

1:06:36	SPEAKER_06
 In model theory, semantic is always like speaker, believe it's not P. You know, like speakers is P.

1:06:40	SPEAKER_05
 We have a theoretical model of sarcasm now.

1:06:43	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

1:06:44	SPEAKER_05
 Now.

1:06:45	SPEAKER_02
 Anyway.

1:06:46	SPEAKER_02
 So I guess let me make a proposal on how to proceed on that, which is that it was Keith's sort of job over the summer to come up with this set of constructions.

1:07:10	SPEAKER_02
 And the most interesting Keith is that you over the next couple of weeks.

1:07:17	SPEAKER_02
 Don't try to do them in detail or formerly, but just try to describe which ones you think we ought to have.

1:07:27	SPEAKER_02
 And then when Robert gets back, we'll look at this set of them.

1:07:32	SPEAKER_02
 Just sort of define your space.

1:07:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

1:07:34	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

1:07:35	SPEAKER_02
 And so these are the set of things that I think we ought to deal with.

1:07:42	SPEAKER_02
 And then we'll go back over it.

1:07:45	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

1:07:46	SPEAKER_02
 We'll give feedback.

1:07:47	SPEAKER_02
 And then we'll have a, at least, initial speck of what we're actually trying to do.

1:07:57	SPEAKER_02
 And that'll also be useful for anybody who's trying to write a parser.

1:08:02	SPEAKER_02
 Kisses in your mouth.

1:08:05	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

1:08:06	SPEAKER_02
 Who might want it, et cetera.

1:08:07	SPEAKER_02
 So you know, we get this four-tooled fixed.

1:08:14	SPEAKER_02
 And then we have an idea of the initial range.

1:08:19	SPEAKER_02
 And then of course, Nancy, you're going to have to do your set of, but you don't have to do that anyway.

1:08:27	SPEAKER_02
 So we're going to get, they're basically dealing with two domains, the first domain in the child language learning.

1:08:34	SPEAKER_02
 And we'll see what we need for those two.

1:08:39	SPEAKER_02
 And then my proposal would be to not totally cut off more general discussion, but to focus really detailed work on the subset of things that we really want to get done.

1:08:57	SPEAKER_02
 And then as a kind of separate thread, think about the more general things and all that.

1:09:04	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I also think the detailed discussion would bring us to problems that are all for general information.

1:09:09	SPEAKER_02
 Without doubt.

1:09:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

1:09:11	SPEAKER_02
 But what I want to do is to constrain the things that we really feel responsible for.

1:09:18	SPEAKER_02
 So that we said, these are the things we're really going to try to do by the end of the summer.

1:09:22	SPEAKER_02
 And other things we'll put on a list of research problems or something, because you can easily get the point where nothing gets done because every time you start to do something, you say, oh, yeah, but what about this case?

1:09:37	SPEAKER_02
 This is called being a linguist.

1:09:40	None
 Yeah.

1:09:41	SPEAKER_06
 And that's what I want to do.

1:09:46	SPEAKER_06
 For me.

1:09:48	SPEAKER_03
 As I quote in Dr. Schumer, where some guy goes, every time I fire a linguist, the performance other recognize her goes up.

1:09:55	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

1:09:58	SPEAKER_02
 But anyway, is that make sense as a general way to proceed?

1:10:03	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, we'll start with that just figuring out what needs to be done.

1:10:07	SPEAKER_05
 Then actually, the next step is to start trying to do it.

1:10:10	SPEAKER_05
 Exactly right, right?

1:10:13	SPEAKER_05
 OK.

1:10:15	SPEAKER_04
 We have a little bit of news with this minor stuff.

1:10:18	SPEAKER_03
 Who can I add out of power?

1:10:20	SPEAKER_03
 Can I ask a quick question about this?

1:10:22	SPEAKER_03
 Is this, was it intentional to leave off things like inherits and?

1:10:27	SPEAKER_03
 Oops.

1:10:29	SPEAKER_05
 No.

1:10:30	SPEAKER_06
 No, really?

1:10:31	SPEAKER_06
 Just on the construction, right?

1:10:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

1:10:33	SPEAKER_03
 Like, construction's going to hurt from other things in my right.

1:10:36	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

1:10:37	SPEAKER_06
 I didn't want to think too much about that for now.

1:10:40	SPEAKER_06
 So maybe it was subconsciously intentional.

1:10:42	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

1:10:44	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, there should be.

1:10:45	SPEAKER_05
 I wanted to find out someday if there was going to be some way of dealing with, if this is the right term, multiple inheritance, where one corporation is inheriting from both parents or different ones, or three or four different ones.

1:11:00	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

1:11:00	SPEAKER_05
 The problem is that then you have to reach of how they're getting bound together.

1:11:05	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

1:11:06	SPEAKER_06
 And there are certainly cases like that, even, just semantics chemos we have, some examples.

1:11:10	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

1:11:11	SPEAKER_06
 And we've been talking a little bit about that.

1:11:12	SPEAKER_02
 So what I would like to do is separate that problem out.

1:11:16	SPEAKER_02
 So my argument is there's nothing you can do with that that you can't do by just having more construction.

1:11:27	SPEAKER_02
 It's like we're in, doesn't have the deep linguistic insights and stuff.

1:11:31	SPEAKER_02
 Ah, whatever.

1:11:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, no, no, no, no, by all means.

1:11:34	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

1:11:34	SPEAKER_02
 And so what I'd like to do is in the short run, focus on getting it right.

1:11:40	SPEAKER_02
 And when we think we have it right, then saying, ah-ha, can we make it more elegant?

1:11:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

1:11:45	SPEAKER_02
 Can we connect it?

1:11:46	SPEAKER_02
 What are the generalizations and stuff?

1:11:48	SPEAKER_02
 But rather than trying to guess a inheritance structure and all that sort of stuff before we know what we're doing.

1:11:56	SPEAKER_02
 So I would say in the short run, we're not going to, first of all, not doing them yet at all.

1:12:02	SPEAKER_02
 And it could be that halfway through we say, ah-ha, we now see how we want to clean it up.

1:12:10	SPEAKER_02
 And inheritance is only one, I mean, that's one way to organize it, but there are others.

1:12:16	SPEAKER_02
 And it may or may not be the best way.

1:12:20	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sorry, you had news.

1:12:21	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, just small stuff.

1:12:24	SPEAKER_04
 Thanks to Eva.

1:12:25	SPEAKER_04
 On our website, we can know if you want to run Java based, you can see, download these classes.

1:12:34	SPEAKER_04
 And then it will enable you.

1:12:36	SPEAKER_04
 She modified the query so it has no button menu item or saving it into the embedded Java based.

1:12:45	SPEAKER_04
 So that's wonderful.

1:12:47	SPEAKER_04
 Great.

1:12:47	SPEAKER_04
 And you tested it out.

1:12:51	SPEAKER_04
 Do you want to say something about that?

1:12:53	SPEAKER_00
 I was just checking like, when we want to get the posterior probability of variables, you know how you ask whether we can just observe all the variables in the same way so you can't have to make separate queries every time.

1:13:07	SPEAKER_01
 So yeah.

1:13:09	SPEAKER_01
 What's the purpose?

1:13:12	SPEAKER_00
 For the time being, it's very important.

1:13:13	SPEAKER_00
 You just have a long list of all the variables.

1:13:16	SPEAKER_06
 All the things you want to query.

1:13:18	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, you just have to pass it to them.

1:13:19	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

1:13:20	SPEAKER_04
 Other, maybe in a long term, that's good news because of course, that's the thinking.

1:13:25	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know how we can do that at all.

1:13:28	SPEAKER_04
 That's a pretty good discussion for it.

1:13:31	SPEAKER_04
 And they're running late, so I had an idea yesterday, but I don't know what the machine can start.

1:13:48	SPEAKER_02
 What do you mean, sure, tell us what it is.

1:13:49	SPEAKER_04
 The construal that has been pointed to, but this may be made precise by any means, may work as follows.

1:14:08	SPEAKER_04
 I thought that we would, the problem I think would be a little bit nice, and I've no clue whether it's work or nothing so it's just a pattern.

1:14:18	SPEAKER_04
 A couple of matters, this is a famous here.

1:14:22	SPEAKER_04
 Imagine you write a base net.

1:14:26	None
 Base?

1:14:27	SPEAKER_04
 Base netting.

1:14:30	SPEAKER_04
 Completely from scratch.

1:14:31	SPEAKER_04
 Every time you do a construal.

1:14:33	SPEAKER_04
 So you have nothing.

1:14:36	SPEAKER_04
 This is quite a piece of paper.

1:14:39	SPEAKER_04
 You consult your ontology, which will tell you a bunch of stuff and parts of the product.

1:14:44	SPEAKER_04
 Grab out the things that you need.

1:14:47	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

1:14:47	SPEAKER_04
 Then you simply write a piece into your real white piece of paper.

1:14:54	SPEAKER_04
 And you will get a lot of notes and stuff out of there.

1:14:58	SPEAKER_04
 You won't really get any CPTs.

1:15:00	SPEAKER_04
 Therefore, we need everything that triggers to what the situation is.

1:15:05	SPEAKER_04
 I need the context in this stuff.

1:15:06	SPEAKER_04
 So you get whatever comes from discourse.

1:15:09	SPEAKER_04
 I've also filtered.

1:15:11	SPEAKER_04
 So only the ontology relevance stuff from the discourse does the situation in the user model.

1:15:17	SPEAKER_04
 And that fills in your CPTs with which you can then query the net that you just wrote and find out how the X is construed as in utterance, U.

1:15:31	SPEAKER_04
 And the embedded Java base works exactly like that.

1:15:34	SPEAKER_04
 But once you have the precise form it in which to write it, so we write it down, you query.

1:15:40	SPEAKER_04
 You get the result, you get thrown away.

1:15:43	SPEAKER_04
 And the nice thing about this idea is that you don't ever have to sit down and think about it or write about it.

1:15:48	SPEAKER_04
 You may have some general rules as to how things will be equals to this.

1:15:52	SPEAKER_04
 What so that will allow you to craft the initial notes.

1:15:56	SPEAKER_04
 But in that respect, it's completely scalable, because it doesn't have any prior configuration.

1:16:05	SPEAKER_04
 It's just you need an ontology of the domain, and you need the context to pen modules.

1:16:11	SPEAKER_04
 And if this can be made to work at all,

1:16:15	SPEAKER_02
 let me kind of thank you. It sounds to me like you want PRM's.

1:16:21	SPEAKER_02
 PRM's?

1:16:22	SPEAKER_04
 PRM?

1:16:23	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's a great forward thing.

1:16:27	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, you can't.

1:16:28	SPEAKER_02
 See, the critical thing about the PRM is it gives these relations in general form.

1:16:34	SPEAKER_02
 So once you have instantiated the PRM with the instances, and then you can unfold it.

1:16:44	SPEAKER_04
 No, I was using a generic.

1:16:46	SPEAKER_04
 So probabilistic whatever additional models, whatever you write at it.

1:16:52	SPEAKER_02
 What matters a lot?

1:16:54	SPEAKER_02
 Because what you want are these generalized rules about the way things relate that you then instantiate in each case.

1:17:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

1:17:03	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe the way it works.

1:17:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's the only way it could work.

1:17:08	SPEAKER_02
 We have our local expert on PRM's.

1:17:12	SPEAKER_02
 My guess is that they're not currently good enough to do that.

1:17:15	SPEAKER_02
 But we will have to see.

1:17:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that would be a good thing to try.

1:17:26	SPEAKER_02
 It's related to the Hobbes abduction story.

1:17:34	SPEAKER_02
 In that, you throw everything into a pot and you try to come up with the.

1:17:39	SPEAKER_02
 That's the question.

1:17:40	SPEAKER_02
 There's no theorem.

1:17:41	SPEAKER_02
 No, there isn't a theorem proofer.

1:17:43	SPEAKER_02
 But the PRMs are like rules of inference.

1:17:54	SPEAKER_02
 And you're coupling a bunch of them together.

1:17:56	SPEAKER_02
 And then instead of proving you're trying to compute the most likely.

1:18:00	SPEAKER_02
 Trick.

1:18:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's a good thing to put in your thesis proposal.

1:18:13	SPEAKER_02
 So you're going to write something for us before you go?

1:18:17	SPEAKER_02
 You have something.

1:18:19	SPEAKER_04
 In the process of.

1:18:20	SPEAKER_02
 So what are we going to meet again?

1:18:24	SPEAKER_00
 When are you leaving?

1:18:25	SPEAKER_04
 There's it, right?

1:18:26	SPEAKER_04
 Persons my last day here.

1:18:29	SPEAKER_04
 So I would suggest this one as a puzzle.

1:18:33	SPEAKER_02
 Do you mean where we the whole thing?

1:18:36	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't mean you just two of us.

1:18:38	SPEAKER_02
 Obviously we can do this.

1:18:39	SPEAKER_02
 But the question is, do you want to, for example, send a little group a draft your thesis proposal and get another session on feedback on that?

1:18:50	SPEAKER_02
 Or.

1:18:52	SPEAKER_04
 We can go through Thursday again.

1:18:57	SPEAKER_05
 Find anything?

1:19:01	SPEAKER_05
 Should we do the 1vm time for Thursday since we were on that before?

1:19:05	SPEAKER_05
 Sure.

1:19:06	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

1:19:08	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

1:19:09	SPEAKER_04
 First, then one.

1:19:11	SPEAKER_04
 I can also maybe then run through the talk I have to give as email, which highlights all of our work.

1:19:20	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

1:19:21	SPEAKER_04
 And we can make some last few changes on that.

1:19:25	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

1:19:26	SPEAKER_03
 You can just give them the abstract that we wrote for the paper.

1:19:28	SPEAKER_02
 That'll tell them exactly what's going on.

1:19:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

1:19:33	SPEAKER_06
 All right.

1:19:33	SPEAKER_06
 Can we do 130?

1:19:35	SPEAKER_06
 No.

1:19:36	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, you already told me no.

1:19:37	SPEAKER_06
 One.

1:19:38	SPEAKER_00
 It's fine.

1:19:39	SPEAKER_00
 We can do one.

1:19:40	SPEAKER_00
 It's fine.

1:19:44	SPEAKER_05
 To me, this is equal.

1:19:47	SPEAKER_05
 I don't care.

1:19:48	SPEAKER_05
 For all?

1:19:50	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, it's fine.

1:19:50	None
 For?

1:19:51	None
 Yeah.

1:19:51	SPEAKER_04
 No, no.

1:19:53	SPEAKER_04
 I don't care.

1:19:54	SPEAKER_04
 It's equal to all of us.

1:19:56	SPEAKER_04
 You can decide one or four.

1:19:58	SPEAKER_03
 The person is ununancy.

1:19:59	SPEAKER_04
 This actually is actually what she likes for, because it forces the meeting record of people to put discussion to vote.

1:20:06	SPEAKER_00
 OK.

1:20:06	SPEAKER_00
 Four.

1:20:08	SPEAKER_05
 Well, if you insist, then.

1:20:09	SPEAKER_05
 Thank you.

1:20:10	None
 Sorry.

1:20:11	None
 Sorry.

1:20:17	None
 Sorry.

1:20:18	None
 You can't call that.

1:20:20	None
 Prānir Hell, msra.

1:20:50	None
 You
