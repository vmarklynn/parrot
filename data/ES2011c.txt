0:01:00	None
 Whah...

0:01:13	None
 Whatever Everyone, hope you have a nice lunch.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_01
 All right, we're moving on to conceptual design I just review what we did in our last meeting. Under marketing we targeted our audience and yeah, that was generally how helpful that was. Then we considered some design options with how it should look. We discussed an iPod-like button system which we haven't concluded but we're in. So if you all have presentations to do, we can see where you've come from our last. Does everyone have presentations? Yes. Then anybody likes to go first?

0:02:41	SPEAKER_02
 So I've been looking at the components design mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_02
 So we need some custom design parts and other parts which are used standard. I assume we'll be custom designing our case, probably a hard plastic or some other material case to protect their node and the locator. We'll need to design a circuit board because a circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output. So you have to design that in time. But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out. Standard parts include the buttons and the wheels, the iPod style wheel. The infrared LED is actually going to be included in the circuit board that comes with it. We need a radio sender and receiver, those are standard and we also need a beeper or a buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_02
 So we have some material options. We can use rubber, plastic, wood or titanium. I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy. And the rubber case requires rubber buttons. So if we definitely want plastic

0:03:59	SPEAKER_01
 buttons we shouldn't have a rubber case. And why not wood? And why not wood?

0:04:05	SPEAKER_02
 Well we can use wood. I don't know why we want to. And also we should know that if we want an iPod style wheel button it's going to require a slightly more expensive chip.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_02
 We can't use the minimal chip. We need the next higher grade which is called regular.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think it's much more expensive but it is more expensive. So that's what I've got on design. It's good.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_00
 Can I do an X because I have to say something about the material? Yeah. Just a bit shocking.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_00
 Right. I have been searching the current trends both on the web and via fashion watches.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_00
 And the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion fancy look and feel.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_00
 This comes technology and the innovations through that. And the last thing is the easy to use factor. Fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing. But I suppose that is included in the ease of use. Our fashion watches in Milan and Paris have decided, well notice that the food and vegetable theme is the current trend. And therefore we need to go for that if we want whatever our motto is. Fashion, we go for fashion. The fashion and electronics. So we want to put the fashion electronics. We need to go for vegetables.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_00
 We also go for a spongy feel. So the question of our technology, what is industrial designer as to the material should be limited to. I don't know how spongy can be, should discuss this to be able to know how spongy can be achieved. But apparently that's the way to know. I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables but that's just the person looking. And I think people like to have fruits instead of vegetables in their sitting room. There's just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed. So that still has to do with the material discussion.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_00
 Should we print the fruit stuff or should the actual remote look like a fruit? And finally again with the spongy. It has to be technologically innovative. So maybe again our industrial design should look into that or come up with a solution that's better than mine. To summarize, these are the points that need to be touched in order to get a good decision and hopefully our user interface has more to say about the matter. Thank you for your attention.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, so that fruit and vegetables thing. I actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it's a trend in fashion. You're not going to wear your remote control. So, so

0:08:26	SPEAKER_03
 okay, let me get this right. Okay. Okay. Here we go. Conceptual user interface. I'm going to try to talk about what kind of how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control based on fruit vegetable design. And basically, so this is a touch-based graphical interface system. So people are going to be looking at this little screen. I mean, I assume are we still on the screen idea? We haven't discussed that last time.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_03
 Because if we're going to have to have, if we have this, it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the wheel.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_02
 It seems like you would need a screen. You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song, like you know that band or whatever. But like if you think of your channels, it's you know one, two, three. Yeah, but if so is it just okay.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_03
 So you're going to have to switch to like DVD and like other things like that.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_01
 We're actually not having DVD. That was one of I was trying to update you on that.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. But the screen can come up on the telly. Okay. Okay. So anyway, we just we need to, okay, so we're not going to have a screen.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_03
 I think I was thinking, okay, so basically it's just going to be a wheel then. You're just going to, I mean I think you're going to have to have some kind of a yeah, like you're going to have to be able to switch to like a mode where you, okay, we're not choosing that.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_03
 I guess what like choose channel control. Like if you, because people aren't going to be able to have like, you know, channels one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_03
 So that I think people seem to be. Yeah. You know, but you're going to have to scroll to get channels. So, I guess that's what I was trying to do.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_03
 I guess that's what I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because so that people can go or go back and forth and choose it.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_03
 Or then again, if you just, I guess I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the TV, like what channel you're on.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_03
 You just scroll and you can just get to like five or like 12. But I actually had one with a wheel and it did show up on TV.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. But what if you have satellite, you know, like 200 channels that get channeled. You have to. You can quickly.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_03
 You can, but I think the wheel goes to like 100 channels, at least on theirs. Yeah. If you do, so it'll have to be, I mean, so we basically just kind of need to figure out like what kind of, you know, range we need to have on the wheel.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_03
 And so you're, you know, you're doing this motion to like control the channels or like once you stop that, you know, you can like tap for different.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. You can call it different, you know, functions like volume or like you can tap just to get to different channels. Like if you just wanted to go to like from five to six, you can tap.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_03
 And then there's also the concern about, you know, how do you get to the menu if you want to change the brightness of your television or if you want to, you know, switch around.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know, like these different modes, like turn on the timer or like something like that. I mean, with that many options, you'd, I think that the screen would be better.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_01
 I would think so too. Like the menu option.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_03
 So I mean, it seems it would, it does seem a little silly to have the screen if you hardly are ever using it, you know, because but then again, it does make kind of if the screen sort of just like an option that like is just there and you're not really using it. That's kind of.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_02
 It's more expensive. Yeah. Yeah. The design people. Yeah. That's the only thing that you have to get an advanced chip if you want to have a screen in which is more expensive than the regular chip, which is more expensive than the.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_03
 You can get to, you know, you can, like maybe it'll be that central button that like then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the TV and you can just scroll around to do the time to do that.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. Yeah.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_01
 So it would have all these different options. Yeah.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 Changing.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_03
 But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. Well, we don't want the screen, I guess, but because that just it does seem like it would probably like incredibly expensive.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know. And then.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_03
 So just in really all you need is like this little wheel.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. Um. Right. What if I mean, if you're thinking of the design of it now, like the.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_01
 You know, physical attributes. Yeah.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_01
 And you just have this. And it's like just long silver thing or whatever.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, are you going to have any buttons on that besides power and this thing?

0:13:43	SPEAKER_03
 Or it doesn't seem that you would need anything besides I mean in the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like a longer than one second and it turns on the TV.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_01
 So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you had us before?

0:13:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Like I think we're looking at something that could be like.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_03
 Like even maybe like a certain I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, it needs to be easy to somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. I mean, how do I'm not really.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_03
 When I use an iPod, I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. I've seen some people just kind of like that. Yeah. Or your thumb or something.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_02
 So when we had the wheelie remote control, we just on the top, I think you held it like that.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. Yeah.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_02
 And with their buttons on there as well. Yeah. Well, it had the wheelie thing and then it had those 18 different buttons that I don't know what they do.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. We just use the top part. Yeah.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. So, but I mean, I think it could be pretty small. Like I mean, you want it to be large enough that you can.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_01
 What if you had like a cover that whenever buttons that you don't use very much.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_01
 Like you see, you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_01
 So the options are there, but they're not interfering with the design and the practicality of it.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_01
 We can't you just get out of talking about that. Like, yeah, just like maybe something on the side.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. But they don't flip over.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_03
 But I mean, do you need that if you can get to, you know, if so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the TV screen?

0:15:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. I mean, I guess that's the thing is.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_03
 If we can do this, that probably. Yeah. You wouldn't I don't I don't think you would even need it.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. So. So I guess we have to look into the like the programming.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_01
 How this how they actually program these things.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_03
 How they make the menu show up on the TV.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, you can do it. I mean, it would.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't seem that hard. It's going to be inside the TV and I'm not inside the remote.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I've never bought a remote. It sounds like this remote is going to be purchased separately from the television.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_03
 Well, they usually are. Well, I've never bought a gesture remote.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_03
 Like, so I don't really know. But I think that's right.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_02
 It almost comes in between you.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_03
 So. But I mean, it's I've never had a hard time with like my remote like bringing up the menu screen.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_03
 If you need to like change the date or whatever, you know, and I don't think that should be too hard.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 Most of the ones we've had have had the menu button because it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. So just didn't come up every day or something.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. Also.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_03
 So do you need. I guess we have to think about.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_03
 But I mean, you just basically need the output signal.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. It's bringing up.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_00
 But also, if you have it on the screen, you can actually write everything out because the problem with buttons is like they have these sort of abbreviations.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_03
 So, but you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen on the tele.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. So yeah, I think I mean, I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really cool idea because you know, it is so obnoxious to like have to push those.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_03
 Like, okay, now I hit this, you know, you have a little guide out and I hit this button twice.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_01
 And it is technologically innovative in a way.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_03
 And it is trendy. The iPods are.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. Right now.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_00
 Did you get that picture on the day of the picture?

0:17:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. My web research.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_00
 What are we going to do about this bunch, the bullpen and grand drive?

0:17:42	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I was going to say, you said people want spongy.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_02
 One of the material options is a sort of rubber that's not on like those stress ball things.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, okay. That would be spongy.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_00
 Just nice feel.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_03
 That would be kind of, you know, usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic mouse type, you know, thing.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, definitely.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_03
 What if we had like a spongy sort of like stress ball, you kind of feel like.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think it could work.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_03
 Or what if we integrated the, yeah, what if the whole thing about the fruit of vegetables, we somehow made it tactily, you know, we could tap into that.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_03
 So like it feels like vegetable.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_00
 It's a small thing.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_00
 Instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana which you can't.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_00
 Particularly fun though.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_00
 You could just have covers and then your mobile, it's like a mobile phone thing.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_00
 It was a time when they had all these different cars.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_02
 And they do like the computers or they have like the grapefruit apple machine and they have like the blueberry.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_02
 Like all the colors were named after fruits.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_03
 You could name it after.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_00
 I think the color can fit to your sitting room.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_00
 So if you have red sitting where you can have strawberry and then you have the green one with that.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_01
 So what if, what if, yeah.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_01
 This is, I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_01
 I'm like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_01
 So like what you're feeling is comfortable and then there's more of a hard plastic thing.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_01
 Where that thing is.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_01
 And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the color or the fruit are vegetable that's on there.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_01
 Is that kind of, because I'm thinking silver because those are our company colors.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_03
 Unfortunately, you don't have silver.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, how are you, how are you all envisioning by what we've just, with your back, we've just got about the.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe a ball.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_01
 A ball.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_00
 No, squashy ball.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_00
 A relaxing squashy ball.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_03
 That's in the shape of a fruit.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I see you're thinking it's where do you think you're thinking you changed the hard thing.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_00
 And I'm thinking how do you change the hard?

0:20:16	SPEAKER_00
 Would you put a sticker sort of, because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit like that.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_01
 This is just, okay.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_01
 Say that's the squashy bit squashy bit.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I was thinking of getting a cover for.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I was thinking this, sorry.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_01
 I was thinking this bit here would be the cover.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_01
 And like that's your actual thing.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_01
 And like, you can have like cherries and things around there.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_02
 I was thinking of a single ball shape.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_01
 I was thinking of who was like this, because the way you were describing the iPod and the, the role thing.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 It's like it has to be, yeah.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_01
 It's almost like your thumb is further up, so if you could squish it lower.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_00
 So it wouldn't be very big.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_00
 And I'd like to have big, this big, and then you just did up.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, what if the squashy bit, oh, sorry.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_03
 So you're saying the squishy part's like detachable.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_03
 And you can, so maybe one, you know, you can have like the broccoli squishy thing.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_03
 And then you could have like the banana squishy thing.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_03
 And you could get, you could have your choice.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_00
 I can't just like cover.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_00
 Cover.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_00
 But well, the question is which ones easiest change.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_00
 And we can just compact our relevant department for that.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_00
 And see what the cost is for covering that or covering that.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_00
 For now we can do two prototypes, maybe, and then try and ask users what best is.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_00
 That's nice.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's nice to have a drawing because it's neat.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's not very neat.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I think, and I think the hand, I think the handheld part is definitely.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_03
 So you could make that into the food and vegetable plant.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_00
 If it's a bit like there's juggling balls, you can change shape according to your, to the way you hold it.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, if it's got sand in it, maybe or something.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_00
 It just mulls to your hands.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_03
 So where are the fruit and vegetables now?

0:22:31	SPEAKER_02
 I guess it would be either in the color of that plastic base of the front door in the color of the squishy thing underneath.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_00
 And the rest is the company color silver.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_01
 It was, yeah, silver and yellow.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_01
 It looks like.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_03
 We could promote the banana one.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_03
 Like.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, that's another question where are we going to, or we should have the logo somewhere on it.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_00
 Should also fit the box in the switch.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_02
 I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic base.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_02
 And that would, especially if you're switching out the squishy part, then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off of it.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_03
 It would be interesting to have the squishy bit, the part that you can change into the different trendy vegetables and fruits.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_02
 No, I know.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_02
 It spends so much time, you're squishing it to your own personal hand.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_02
 You can give it a new one, you'd have to do it all over again.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_00
 A bit of automatic.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_01
 But if someone, components, concept, question mark, energy, question mark, is that you?

0:23:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_01
 All right, all right.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_01
 So what do we know about energy?

0:24:03	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, we're going to use batteries, right?

0:24:05	SPEAKER_02
 We actually have an option of batteries, solar power, and a dynamo, which is something I don't know what it is.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, dynamo.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_00
 It's a bicycle, it's a bicycle mechanism, it's the end, it's like if something moves.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the other one was a kinetic thing where you basically have to wind it yourself.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_02
 So I sort of picked battery.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_02
 We could have talked about giving a wind up for a dynamo or solar power.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_02
 But I think solar power is not available to rubber case anyways.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_01
 Battery is something.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's a little weird, the dynamo with the interesting ring.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_00
 The fact with dynamo is the moment you move it, it creates energy on its own.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_00
 What about crypto-savage?

0:24:51	SPEAKER_00
 It's going to store loads of energy and you don't need to buy a battery because I find them in the market.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_00
 But we need to find cost.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_00
 No cost.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_02
 I need to find the cost.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_02
 All it said was it gave sort of a relative, some chips are more expensive than other sort of things.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_02
 It didn't give me any actual cost.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_02
 Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though, but in bulk.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_01
 So I think it's not much of a problem.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_02
 But things like remote controls, a stamp-outed chip, calculated to I think.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_02
 So you can mass produce some pretty cheap.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_02
 But it's not like a computer, you can't like reprogram or remote controls like stamp-talk to the chip.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_01
 So chip on print means like that.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_01
 And case.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_01
 I guess it's what we've been talking about.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_01
 I'm thinking of like some tactics.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_01
 Let's see.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_01
 Is there anything else we need to talk about?

0:26:12	SPEAKER_01
 One we move on.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_01
 You two are going to be playing with Play-Doh.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_01
 And working on what can fill with design and user interface design.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_01
 You're going to be doing product evaluation.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_01
 So you'll get more instructions from your personal coach.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_01
 Cool.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_01
 See you soon.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_01
 Does it matter that I end early?

0:26:42	SPEAKER_00
 It's strange.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_01
 How early is it?

0:26:48	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's a pop-up thing.
