0:00:00	SPEAKER_04
 Almost.

0:00:20	SPEAKER_04
 There's one more thing I have to get out of the, I have to make sure that this attachment

0:00:25	SPEAKER_03
 will open.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. We'll open that one.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_04
 Time is right.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_04
 In the meantime.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_04
 Let's see what this thing does.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_04
 Just like come up together and disappear one of them.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_04
 We came up together.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_04
 We're good.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_04
 Are we ready to start?

0:01:30	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_04
 It's now quarter of four.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_04
 This is another 40 minute one.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_04
 So it will end at four twenty five.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_04
 Our agenda is as before, for me to open the meeting for us to go over the previous minutes.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_04
 Then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_04
 Sarah present the evaluation criteria.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_04
 We then have a finance aspect, which is a spreadsheet, an Excel spreadsheet.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_04
 And I know what you're all thinking of.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_04
 Oh my.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_04
 Because we're only given a 40 minute time period to get it all in, including the production evaluation.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_04
 So we're going to make a very fast track.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_04
 So as you can see, that's what we do next on this thing.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_04
 So the first thing I have to do is close this.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_04
 So that I can get to.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_04
 Where is it?

0:02:52	SPEAKER_04
 I need to open mine.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_04
 I know that I want the minutes from the previous minutes.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_04
 That should be the minutes.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_04
 From meeting three.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_04
 Is it right with you if I don't switch it to show?

0:03:19	SPEAKER_04
 Just use it as is.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_04
 This is where I can more easily flip it.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_04
 Obviously all of us were here for the last meeting.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_04
 We reviewed the previous minutes before that.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_04
 Each of you major presentations.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_04
 We discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_04
 The market trend of fruit and veg.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_04
 Spongy.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_04
 Fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_04
 We decided chip on print would be used.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_04
 We would use plastic with a rubber casing.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_04
 I think was the consensus powered by kinetic energy.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_04
 There is no decision made on a curvature or double curvature or straight.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_04
 Perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_04
 Looking like a scroll.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_04
 But it's really a push button technology excuse my spelling.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_04
 That was actually in use.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_04
 That is behind the scenes is push button which we according to Kate have a very good grasp on doing that in production.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_04
 We decided that separate fashion will cover your fruit and veg.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_04
 It might be a separate product that could be suggested to management.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_04
 And as suggested yellow with black buttons with a company logo.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_04
 A slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_04
 We did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_04
 We had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_04
 We had to follow that up and prepare for the last one.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_04
 And we closed as it ran out of time.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_04
 Is that a fair presentation of what happened?

0:05:36	SPEAKER_04
 Okay back to this meeting.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_04
 We're down to the prototype presentation.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_04
 Alright over to you.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_04
 Well.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_01
 To.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah well we see we each made one we didn't have enough yellow dough.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_00
 This is one that I made.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_00
 It says curved easy to hold hand held nice and small with big easy buttons.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_00
 This is like a scroll but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_00
 Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television satellite.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_00
 I mean this is the infrared thing that's going to zap at the television.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not quite sure how to make that but I'm sure it will work.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_00
 This is on of switch because I think we do need that.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_00
 I think it gives it a nice balance and it's going to have the logo imprinted on it.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_00
 In there.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_00
 As for what it's actually made of well the function of these buttons is up down left and right in the different menus.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_00
 So the position that just means right on it easy to see the main feature of it.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_00
 It's just a simple design simple lack of buttons all over the place.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_00
 Alright.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_00
 Forum curved kind of smooth hand held makes it feel nice to hold material.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_00
 I think Kate's going to tackle that quite a bit but I think we have two different options because we did make another one which is in the shape of a banana.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_00
 If you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons like just like this but in the shape of a banana which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_00
 And as a similar sort of scroll push button technology just slight different sign on off switch and infrared.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_00
 I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic so like I guess like an existing remote control but molded and smooth.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_00
 Whereas we thought like with this one or mix and match just we were going to see what you thought that a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_00
 So we have the two options we can follow either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber depending on cost restraints and what we, well what conclusion we reach when we discuss it material.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah that's what I have to say about material. Can I scroll down on that answer? Well color I think I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons because that's the company colors but if anybody's got any other suggestions I'm quite willing to consider them as well.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_00
 So it depends what you think about these ideas.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know very much to add the case, the case can be either spongy rubber or hard plastic but absolutely sure about a combination of the two but it can be either those we have the technology to do that.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_03
 And as for the actual components.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_03
 As Steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture we have simple rubber push buttons which provide all the functionality we need.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_03
 The diode that actually does the infrared is at the end it's the stalk of the banana.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_03
 It's just the end of this version.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_03
 So that's for material color, well Steph's the expert on color.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have any particular restrictions on that.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_00
 As for the fruit or organic theme, this one is obviously fruit shaped.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_00
 This one has no obvious connections to fruit but because it's round and moulded it kind of makes you think organic.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_00
 It's actually really kitty.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_00
 It's more like yeah you'd expect it to be like a child's sort of toy remote control instead of a real one which I quite like that.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry, image.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_00
 It's very big and chunky and child friendly.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_03
 Would you care to examine the prototypes?

0:10:45	SPEAKER_00
 Hold them and see it, you know.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_00
 The curvature is up to your liking.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_03
 I see the on-offs in the back.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_03
 If you're doing a tirade and then you just thumb.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_03
 And it was partly we thought the design looked better.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_03
 But it could be moved if marketing feel it's important to have the on-off button in a different place.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_04
 I could see this thing unless it's reinforced having a problem with the breaking.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_00
 That's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it because it would be rigid.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_02
 I like the fact that on both of them the cues press are prominent.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we really like that design.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_00
 It looks just like a logo, that arrangement of the keys.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_00
 Like a compass point, you know, just up, down, left and right.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_00
 And we think we could make that quite a good feature. It's like the iPod scroll wheel.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but it's also like Jack's.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's what it makes me think of.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_00
 Mobile phones, I was thinking.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_00
 Give me something like this. What does that remind me of?

0:11:59	SPEAKER_03
 And it's a very simple design. There's not a lot to go wrong.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_03
 The components are cheap to make.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_02
 It's also in terms of being lost.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_02
 It looks quite different.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_02
 You know, I have several forum remotes and they are the same until you get a close.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_02
 You know, this is really identifiable.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, the thing is we do need to develop our technology of, I mean, actually how to program the menus and what sort of text box is going to appear at the bottom of the screen.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_00
 But we do definitely think that it's a viable option.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_04
 The next item is evaluation.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_02
 If that's if you finish.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_02
 Should I take the power?

0:12:47	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, sorry.

0:12:48	None
 Okay.

0:12:51	None
 Okay.

0:12:54	None
 Okay.

0:12:57	None
 Okay.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_02
 This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_02
 And the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_02
 So this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by the consumers as well as incorporate all of our insight into this evaluation exercise.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_02
 So I'm going to go and use the whiteboard.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_02
 And I've made a list of criteria to look at.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_02
 And so I'm going to, I'm going to leave this up as the last thing, but for the evaluation, it's going to be one is true and seven is false going over these different criteria.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_02
 So one through seven faults and I'm going to now use the board.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_01
 So, um,

0:14:48	SPEAKER_02
 fancy technologically. Easy to use trendy.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_00
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_01
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_00
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_00
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_00
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_00
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_00
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_00
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_00
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'm going to go over the options.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_04
 I think we're good.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you for everyone's help with that.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_04
 And we're going to raise what's called a spreadsheet that they provided to me.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_04
 Hand dynamo battery kinetic solar cells.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_04
 Kinetic is, and how many of those will we need per just we only need one.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_03
 Simple because we just got push buttons so we can do it with simple which is the strip of the cheapest.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_04
 Do we say plastic?

0:25:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_04
 Because the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_04
 And then we're going to put the rubber on top.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_04
 And then we're going to put the rubber on top.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_02
 We went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not sure what was.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_02
 So, we're going to put the rubber on top.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_00
 And then we're going to put the rubber on top.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_04
 And then we're going to put the rubber on top.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.
