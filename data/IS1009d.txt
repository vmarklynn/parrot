0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, okay.

0:00:02	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to the arches go first.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_00
 I did a little this before.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_00
 Hello.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_00
 Like before, I have to reduce the meetings from the minutes from the last meeting.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_00
 And so here we go.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_00
 It was discussed in the last meeting, which was opened by the presentation from the interface designer that looks would be very important on this new remote.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_00
 And it is to send messages of course to the TV. It should have nine channel buttons, and next button, volume buttons, subtitle buttons, switch to control features, color, contrast, sharpness, etc.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_00
 It would have a memory switch, a mute button in case a telephone rings or something.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_00
 Speech recognition is one of her very favorite personal features she would like to be integrated in this new remote.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_00
 She would be a child-friendly design with few buttons, colorful, maybe with star-shaped or other-shaped buttons.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_00
 She presented also an oversized remote, which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_00
 She was challenged on that point.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_00
 Her very personal favorite really she would very much like to see a speech recognizer integrated in this remote.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_00
 The industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_00
 She would like special pace made out of plastic that is very strong, not using any harmful materials. She would be recyclable and she would be colorful.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_00
 She would have an integrated circuit board that is highly sophisticated and temperature-resistant.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_00
 She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated. Technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor, diode, transistor, resonator, and if possibly rechargeable battery.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_00
 Of course the circuit board and how it works you press the button. The chip is more code-related to the generator amplification.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_00
 The circuit board is very inexpensive to build. She thinks this is a great feature to consider.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_00
 She would like this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_00
 The scrolling method is more expensive and not practical anymore. She should be battery operated and of course she would have special cases.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_00
 The marketing expert who has to finally come up with to market this product has been watching the competition, has some research on the internet, and also has used her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote should be small, easy to use and it should be eye catching.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_00
 From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_00
 To do that maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_00
 There are too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter. We prefer to have one or two features that can be really driven home.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_00
 It should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel. She feels that's really what people want today.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_00
 The decision that we took last time was that this special feature we would like to see is a speech recognizer. The energy should be battery, should be on a chip, should be trendy design, compact and strong and should have buttons.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_00
 And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_00
 Now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_03
 Just to look like the button path I'll explain.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_04
 This is what we have made. This is a model of the remote controller which we are going to build. This is in a snail shape. It is attractive and it's blue in color bright.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_04
 It has yellow buttons and all the different color buttons. It will be easily fit into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_04
 Good.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_04
 You used to have all the buttons.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_04
 The case is plastic and which is strong. The material is plastic and for the buttons it is soft rubber.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_04
 You will be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it. For the lid for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_04
 It is a bulb like an ordinary infrared.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_03
 The button path will be explained by Falsina. We decided upon including certain features and our remote.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_03
 These features include the signal emitting signal, it is the LED or LED, the infrared.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_03
 We have included the switch on and off button.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_03
 We have included another feature that is the mute button on the side of the model.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_03
 We have included one to nine buttons for controlling the different channels.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_03
 We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_03
 We also included two buttons for scrolling down the program channels.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_03
 Our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_03
 We have included a button which is fluorescent green and this is the menu button which will control the brightness of the screen.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_03
 We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_03
 This is a special feature which we have included. This button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_03
 If it is turned towards the right, it will take to the previous channel.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_03
 This is a swapping button.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_01
 The next channel in the numeric pattern or...

0:09:44	SPEAKER_03
 Swapping is if you are watching the second channel and then you go to the 10th channel.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_03
 If you want to go back to the second channel, you can swap this button.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_03
 This remote has inbuilt voice recognizer which will recognize the user's voice and then it will act accordingly.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_03
 This is a proposed model.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_03
 The marketing expert has to give her suggestion when it will be celebrated or it will be cost-effective.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_01
 I really like it.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_01
 It is a very easy way to reach the whole thing with one thumb.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_01
 You don't need two hands and it is easily reachable even for someone with a small hand.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_01
 The buttons are all raised.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_01
 I really like that. You did a good job on that.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_01
 My little designers.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_01
 I like the idea that the on-off button is in a prominent place.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_01
 It sticks up.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_00
 You don't have to go like, oh, you are near it.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_01
 The color is very attractive.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_01
 These buttons around here are the mute buttons.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_03
 These are the front buttons.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_01
 On both sides.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_01
 This brings the menu up on the screen.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_03
 The orange ones are...

0:11:46	SPEAKER_03
 These two are to increase or decrease the volumes.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_03
 I will scroll the program channels.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_01
 I will scroll down the channels.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_01
 Looks like something I can sell.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_00
 I have one question.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_00
 Will there be anything written on the buttons?

0:12:10	SPEAKER_00
 People know or they have to learn that from a piece of paper.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_03
 These buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_03
 You know, it doesn't have to be first.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_00
 Good point.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_01
 We need the symbols because we are going into an international market.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_00
 We can't have anything with language dependent.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_00
 We can have symbols and text.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_04
 We can have on the keys.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_03
 We want to make sure that.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_03
 We have a holder for this remote.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_01
 A shell shape.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_01
 We have a shell.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 We could do something really funny with this.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_01
 The snail is known to be slow.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_01
 We could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_01
 This is a rapid snail.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_00
 What are our special features for the marketing?

0:13:14	SPEAKER_00
 That's really the voice recognition.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_01
 Voice recognition is our selling point.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_00
 Nobody seems to have that in this press range.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_00
 And then the other thing would basically be shape or practicality of use.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_01
 Everybody is going to say their remote control is practical.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_01
 We have to dwell on their appearance.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 You are going to have the best cutist remote control on the block.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 I think we have to play with the image, play with the snail image, play with the visual and then the voice recognition.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_01
 Those are the two things to push.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_01
 The look and the voice recognition.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_01
 They are going to be our two selling points.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_00
 Having said that.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_00
 I am supposed to make a little presentation on it.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_00
 No, this was our evaluation criteria.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_00
 We are going to talk about financing.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_01
 In my instructions, I think it is possible to go to the board and do something.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_00
 Is there a production evaluation?

0:14:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, that is me.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_00
 That is after financing.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_00
 We had looks and voice recognition.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_00
 Now on the financing we bring up the...

0:14:44	SPEAKER_00
 There it is.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_00
 Energy source, we say that is battery.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_00
 That is right.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_00
 Now...

0:15:00	SPEAKER_00
 I guess we use one.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_03
 What?

0:15:10	SPEAKER_00
 The seller chart.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_00
 You are trying to change his project.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_00
 That is nice.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_00
 He told me I could just change it here and that it does not work.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_01
 Can you just fill it in the other boxes?

0:15:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_00
 One.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_00
 I will go away.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_00
 Kinetic source.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_00
 That is in the energy source.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_00
 That is all we need.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_00
 Electronic simple chip on print.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_00
 Is that what we are using?

0:15:44	SPEAKER_00
 One of those.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_00
 One.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_00
 Regular chip on print?

0:15:52	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_00
 That is all we need.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_00
 The one case.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_00
 Uncurt flat single curved double curved.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_04
 This is a single curve.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_00
 I guess it is double curved.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_00
 Double curved.

0:16:10	None
 One of those.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_00
 Case materials supplements.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_00
 Plastic.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_00
 Rubber.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_01
 Rubber because we are going to have the soft buttons.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_04
 I think that is for rubber.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_04
 That is just for the case material.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_00
 Special color so.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_00
 We are having that.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_00
 Then we have the interface push buttons.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_00
 Scroll wheel now.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_00
 Integrated scroll wheel LC display.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_01
 But we didn't put the clock in it after all.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_00
 Spud and supplement special color.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_00
 Special form.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_00
 We do have special form.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_00
 And special material rubber wood.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:17:08	None
 Okay.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_00
 Total 7.6.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_00
 Whatever that means.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_04
 I think that is the price.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_04
 That is the price.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_00
 8.2.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_00
 8.2.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_00
 Nice.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_00
 Nice.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_00
 8.2 right?

0:17:32	SPEAKER_00
 So we look like we are well within budget.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_00
 I guess I should save this.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_00
 I suppose.

0:17:44	None
 Yes.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_02
 Oops.

0:17:50	None
 Haha.

0:17:54	None
 The desktop.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_00
 I just tried that.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_00
 My documents computer.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_00
 My computer.

0:18:12	None
 Here it is.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_00
 Fine.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_00
 Good.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_00
 So that is the good news.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_00
 You are going to be popular.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_00
 So that I think financing was pretty simple.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_00
 Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. I will take my file down so you can bring it up.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:00	None
 Should be able to get it now.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_01
 Why don't you move just to the next slide right away?

0:19:06	SPEAKER_01
 You want to go to the next slide?

0:19:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_01
 Well, obviously my method for the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_01
 Will it sell?

0:19:18	SPEAKER_01
 And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socioeconomic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things that we haven't thought of.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_01
 We can't accept every suggestion of course, but maybe we just need to get a few and show the prototype to consider research groups who don't want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_01
 So we have to get some input from those people.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_01
 And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_01
 And you know, we like it.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_01
 We think it's good.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to get behind it and sell it.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 Next slide please.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_01
 Now the things that I was thinking and my wish list has really been realized in this prototype.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_01
 I wanted the shape to be biomorphic.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't want anything with angles on all square.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_01
 I wanted to be comfy and roundy.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_01
 So we got that size of small.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_01
 The color is bright and warm, which is what we wanted.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_01
 We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_01
 We'll have the soft buttons.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 And the way this is shaped even though it's going to be hard plastic.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_01
 It feels good in your hands, so that's nice.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_01
 And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_01
 So paradoxically the other features, in other words, the look, the feel, and the shape.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_01
 That's what people are going to get in the store.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_01
 They don't have a television in the store.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_01
 They can't play with it.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_01
 So they'll be our main selling points.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_01
 So those have been fulfilled by your prototype.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_01
 And go ahead to the next slide please.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so the shape, I think, is a one.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 That's really excellent shape.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_01
 The size is small.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_01
 And these points are the importance for the marketing.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_01
 These aren't in how I feel.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_01
 I think that it's plenty small enough to sell.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_01
 But I think we're sort of right.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_01
 The scale is one to seven.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_01
 We're sort of right in the middle as far as other competitors.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_01
 And our color, I think, is great.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_01
 The colors are bright and warm, and we really do a great job there.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_01
 And given the constraints that we had, I think we got it as soft as possible.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_01
 And then functionality, I think you did a really good job on functionality.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_01
 Obviously we could have added different functions, but then we disturbed something else.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_01
 So we said that we got to a five out of seven on functionality.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_01
 So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_00
 I just realized one thing.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_00
 In the financing, there was no room for our voice recognizer.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_00
 And I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we had what, eight euros, 20 as our cost?

0:22:15	SPEAKER_01
 Eight, eight, 20, yes.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_01
 And so we've got, we've got four euros to go to spend.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, maximum, we have another four point three euros, I mean, four thirty.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_00
 But, I mean, we have no way of presenting that to management as, you know, as a finished product and saying, we said, always recognizer that costs so much. So we just have to be aware of that.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, and know whether the four thirty will really cover that.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_01
 Well, as we know in today's technological world, you can do just about anything at any price, the problem is quality.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_01
 So we're just going to have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_01
 And it may not be the greatest quality, but it may sell anyway.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_01
 As we've seen with so many of these kinds of products.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sorry to interrupt them, but I just, I just remembered that there was no, that that was not included, that there was no room for any special features.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. So to be aware of that, you want to go to this next slide, marketing expert.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_00
 Well, isn't this my last slide?

0:23:35	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_00
 Good. Yes, it is.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_01
 It goes my last slide, yeah.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_01
 And I'm supposed to present the scale on the whiteboard.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_01
 And we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_01
 So if you put my last slide back up there.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I'm sorry.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_01
 I forgot to do that.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_00
 Wow. Why you need that up?

0:24:06	SPEAKER_01
 Well, because I can't remember what I put on there.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_01
 I think you can make it there.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_01
 You ready? So now we're all supposed to say what we think.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. So on shape.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 I gave it one.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_01
 What would you write?

0:24:36	SPEAKER_01
 One being good and seven being the worst.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_01
 What do you think the shape is?

0:24:42	SPEAKER_01
 One.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. And that's it.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, I think shape is one.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. And how about on size?

0:24:57	SPEAKER_01
 On size?

0:24:58	SPEAKER_01
 You gave it a four.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_01
 I gave it a four.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I feel it's just average.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_00
 I think that would give you that at least a two.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_03
 One.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, even I think it is one.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_01
 Here's the designer.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_01
 Of course you want to give it one.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_01
 And then how about how we're doing on color?

0:25:25	SPEAKER_02
 Color.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_02
 Color.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_01
 Color. I gave it one.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_01
 I really like all those nice bright warm colors.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_00
 I like the colors.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_00
 One.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_04
 One.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_01
 One.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_01
 And how about the feel?

0:25:41	SPEAKER_01
 Taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hand.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_00
 I think I will give it a two.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. I give it a three, two, and a three.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_01
 Three.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe two.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_01
 Two.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_01
 And the next is functionality.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_01
 Where I admit I was a little hard on our team here.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_01
 But.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it's also you can't really try it out.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_00
 The other things you have more, it's more tangible.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_00
 So from that point of view.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_00
 But.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_00
 I'll give it a three.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_01
 Two.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_01
 Two.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_04
 Three.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_01
 Three.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_01
 Well.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_01
 It looks like we've got ourselves a pretty good product.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_01
 Functionality is the only place where maybe we have to think about maybe having forbid having another meeting.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_01
 But otherwise I think we're ready to go with this product.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_01
 Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate?

0:27:07	None
 Yeah.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_00
 Here is what we're looking at.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_00
 Satisfaction on, for example, room for creativity.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_00
 Is there more room for creativity?

0:27:31	SPEAKER_00
 Or are we absolutely happy?

0:27:35	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we can always improve.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_04
 We can make the buttons, few buttons smaller.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_04
 I think they are quite big.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_04
 So I think we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_04
 If we want to have more features in that.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_01
 Well, then again if we're going to do the speech recognition thing, there are going to be some buttons that are going to have to be added for that, for the recording of the speech.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_01
 So that's where we're going to have to do, maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons instead of having two mute buttons.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_01
 And then maybe we can do something with the volume control.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can put that all on one button and a couple of other, maybe consolidate some of the usage and see what we can do with that.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, obviously.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_00
 Bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_00
 And that we still, you know, we probably can't, with this particular item, we probably can't just add a whole lot of more things.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_00
 We need, you know, we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recognizer.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_00
 So the question really is how do we feel with the project process?

0:29:17	SPEAKER_00
 Are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we are not happy with the new product we created or that was created?

0:29:28	SPEAKER_00
 I think personally I think I'm pretty happy.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_00
 I'm pretty happy with the job.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_00
 That's something I think I can market.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_00
 And then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project?

0:29:43	SPEAKER_01
 I think you've done a good job misleading.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_00
 I think teamwork, I think was very, very good.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_00
 I think we are good together as a team.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_00
 And I think we are we happy with some means we used, we used whiteboard, we didn't use digital, well digital pens against these things.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we could have used the whiteboard a little bit more.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, we could. It's maybe not in the best position in the room.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_00
 Sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_00
 And I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_01
 We used to slide because it was better positions.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I think so.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's true.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_00
 And fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_00
 Did we find new ideas? I think we did.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_00
 I think we were very good.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think we did in more than one respect.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_00
 So I think we did very well here.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_00
 Are the costs within budget? Yes, yes.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_00
 It's a project evaluated.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, yes.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_00
 So, then celebration.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_01
 Today we have Apple juice and after we sell the million of them we have champagne.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_00
 So, I thank you all very much.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_00
 I think this was very good.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_00
 And I think we did come up with a new product that's feasible.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_00
 And feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_00
 So, okay.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_01
 What I have my cord behind you.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_01
 I think it.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_00
 I always get it on top of my getting it off.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_00
 It's a really good thing to have it on top of my own.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_03
 You have.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_03
 No, this is a couple minutes.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, you have to have time.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_01
 But we were told we could end the final meeting at any time.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_01
 Whenever we thought we were finished.

0:31:53	None
 I think we should get my microphone out for my next.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_01
 There we go.

0:32:10	None
 Okay.
