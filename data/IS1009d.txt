0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, okay.

0:00:02	None
 I'll let the arches go first.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, oops.

0:00:26	None
 How did I do this before?

0:00:36	SPEAKER_00
 Well, hi everyone again.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_00
 Hello.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_00
 Like before, I have to reduce the meetings from the minutes from the last meeting.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_00
 And so here we go.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_00
 It was discussed in the last meeting, which was opened by the presentation from the interface designer that looks would be very important on this new remote.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_00
 And it is to send messages, of course, to the TV.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_00
 Switch to control features, color, contrast, sharpness, etc.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_00
 You would have a memory switch, a mute button, in case the telephone rings or something.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_00
 Beach recognition is one of her very favorite personal features she would like to be integrated in this new remote.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_00
 It should be a child-friendly design with few buttons, colorful, maybe with star-shaped or other-shaped buttons.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_00
 She presented also an oversized remote, which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_00
 She was challenged on that point.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_00
 But her very personal favorite really, she would very much like to see a speech recognizer integrated in this remote.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_00
 The industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_00
 She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong, not using any harmful materials.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_00
 It should be recyclable and should be colorful.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_00
 It should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature-resistant.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_00
 She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_00
 Technically, this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor, a diode, a transistor, resonator, and, if possible, a rechargeable battery.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_00
 And, of course, the circuit board and how it would work, you press the button, the chip is more code-related to the generator amplification.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_00
 The circuit board is very inexpensive to build.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_00
 And so she thinks this is a great feature to consider.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_00
 This whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_00
 The scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_00
 It should be battery-operated and, of course, should have the special cases.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_00
 The marketing expert who has to finally come up with to market this product has been watching the competition, has done some research on the internet, and also has used personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote should be small, easy to use, and it should be eye-catching.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_00
 From her point of view, of course, one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_00
 To do that, maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on, or in other words, on which our campaign could be built on.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_00
 Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_00
 So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really driven home.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_00
 It should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_00
 She feels that's really what people want today.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_00
 The decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recognizer.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_00
 The energy should be battery, should be on a chip, should be drain design, compact and strong, and should have buttons.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_00
 And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes, from the last meeting.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_00
 Now, we are ready for the presentation of the prototype.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_03
 Just the look-alike, the buttonpad I'll explain.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_04
 So this is what we have made. This is a model of the remote controller which we are going to build.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_04
 This is in a snail shape. It is attractive and it's blue in color, bright.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_04
 It has yellow buttons and all the different color buttons.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_04
 So it is beautiful and compact in shape.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_04
 It will be easy to fit into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_04
 You used to have all the buttons.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_04
 The material which we are going to use for the case is plastic which is strong.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_04
 The material is plastic and for the buttons it is soft rubber.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, that's good.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_04
 That's awesome.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_04
 You will be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_04
 For the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_04
 And the button's part will be explained by Francina.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_03
 We decided upon including certain features are remote.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_03
 Now these features include the signal emitting signal.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_03
 It's the LED or LED infrared.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_03
 Now we have included the switch on and off button.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_03
 Now we have included another feature that is the mute button on the side of the model.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_03
 Then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programs, the different channels.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_03
 We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_03
 And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the program channels.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_03
 Our model also contains a button which is called as a menu button.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_03
 A menu button at the center.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_03
 We have included a button which is fluorescent green color and this is the menu button which will control the color sharpness, brightness of the screen of this picture.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_03
 We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_03
 Now this is a special feature which we have included.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_03
 Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_03
 So if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_03
 If it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_03
 It will take the user to the previous and the next channel.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_03
 So this is a swapping button.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_01
 The next channel in the numeric pattern or?

0:09:44	SPEAKER_03
 No, swapping is if example you are watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_03
 And if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap this button.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:55	None
 Yes.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_03
 And at the end this remote has inbuilt voice recognizer which will recognize the user's voice and then it will act accordingly.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_03
 So this is a proposed model.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_03
 The marketing expert has to give her suggestion and it will be sellable.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_03
 It will request a vector.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_01
 Well, what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_01
 You can really hold it in one hand.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_01
 You don't need two hands and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_00
 The buttons are all raised.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_01
 And if you hold it in the center of your hand you can even reach it over here.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_01
 So you don't have to turn it around, turn it upside down, move it up, up and down.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_01
 I really like that.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_01
 You really did a good job on that.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_01
 My little designers.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_01
 And I like the idea that the on off button is in a really prominent place.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_01
 That's a really good thing.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_00
 And it sort of sticks up.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_00
 So you don't have to first go like, oh yeah, here it's on.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_01
 The color is very attractive.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_01
 These buttons around here are the mute.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_03
 No, these the front buttons here are the mute buttons.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_03
 On both sides?

0:11:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_01
 So you can push either one.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_00
 So if you left handed or right handed you the button.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_01
 And this brings the menu up on the screen.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, yes.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_01
 And the orange ones are.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_03
 These two are the to increase or decrease the volumes.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_03
 And these two are to scroll the program channels.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_03
 Roll up was scroll down the channels.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_01
 Looks like something I can sell.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_01
 And now I'm supposed to.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_00
 I have one question.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_00
 Will there be anything written on the buttons like that people know or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what?

0:12:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_03
 These buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_03
 Will have symbols so that that can be easily.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_00
 That you really know, you know, it doesn't have to.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_01
 First point because we need the symbols because we're going into an international market.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_01
 We can't have anything with language dependent.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_00
 But anyway, it has to have some kind of symbols or text or something.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_04
 We can have on the case.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_04
 That's right.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_00
 We can be printed on the case.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_03
 I just want to make sure of that.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_03
 And one more feature is we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_03
 A shell shape.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_01
 For the snail.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_01
 We have the snail shell.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_01
 He goes right back into his shell.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you know, I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_01
 And we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_01
 You know, that would really work.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_00
 Now, what are our special features for the marketing that's really the voice recognition that's really unusual?

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 I think voice recognition is our big selling point because nobody else seems to have that in this price range.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_00
 And then the other thing would basically be shape or practicality or fuse.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think that everybody is going to say their remote control is practical.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_01
 I think we have to do well on the appearance.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_01
 You're really going to have the best, the cutest remote control on the block.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_01
 So I think we have to play with the image, play with the snail image, play with the visual, and then the voice recognition.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_01
 I think those are the two things to push.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_01
 The look and the voice recognition, they're going to be our two selling points.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_00
 Now, having said that.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_00
 I'm supposed to make a little presentation on it.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_00
 No, now this was our evaluation criteria which we just have done.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_00
 Now we're going to talk about financing.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_02
 Ah.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_01
 But in my instructions, I think it's how I was supposed to go to the board and do something.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_00
 Well, there's a production evaluation, is that you?

0:14:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's me.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_00
 But that's after the financing.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, okay.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_00
 We had looks and voice recognition.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_00
 Now, on the financing, we bring up the...

0:14:43	SPEAKER_00
 There it is.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_00
 Energy source, we say that's battery, right?

0:14:54	SPEAKER_00
 That's right.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_00
 Now.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_00
 So we...

0:15:01	SPEAKER_00
 I guess we use one.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yes.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_03
 What?

0:15:06	SPEAKER_00
 The seller chart, you're trying to change this project.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, that's nice.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_00
 She told me I could just change it here and then it would...

0:15:18	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't work.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_00
 Hmm.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_01
 Can you just fill it in the yellow boxes or...?

0:15:27	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, okay.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_00
 One.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_00
 I'll go away.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_00
 Kinetic solar.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_00
 So that's in the energy source, that's all we need.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_00
 Electronic simple chip on print, is that what we're using?

0:15:44	SPEAKER_00
 One of those.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_00
 Come on.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_00
 One.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_00
 Regular chip on print?

0:15:51	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_00
 That's all we need.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_00
 The one case.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_00
 Uncurved flat, single curved, double curved.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_04
 This is a single curved.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_00
 I guess it's double curved.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_00
 Double curved.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_00
 One of those.

0:16:10	None
 Mm-hmm.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_00
 Case materials supplements.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_00
 Plastic, we said, right?

0:16:16	SPEAKER_00
 Plastic.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_00
 Would rubber?

0:16:19	SPEAKER_01
 Rubber because we're going to have the soft buttons.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_00
 Uh, but yes, but...

0:16:24	SPEAKER_04
 I think that is a...

0:16:26	SPEAKER_04
 That's just for the case materials.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_00
 Special color zone.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_00
 We're having that, right?

0:16:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_00
 And then we have the interface push buttons.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_00
 Mm-hmm.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_00
 Scroll wheel no, integrative scroll wheel LC display.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_01
 We didn't put the clock in it after all, right?

0:16:51	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_00
 Uh, button supplement special color.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_00
 Special form.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_03
 We do have special form.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_00
 And special material rubber would, yes.

0:17:06	None
 Yeah.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_00
 Total 7.6, whatever that means.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_04
 I think that's the...

0:17:17	SPEAKER_00
 That's the price.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_00
 Mm-hmm.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_00
 You should just...

0:17:21	SPEAKER_00
 8.2.

0:17:23	None
 Nice points.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. Yes.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_00
 8.2, right?

0:17:32	SPEAKER_00
 So we...

0:17:33	SPEAKER_00
 Looks like we are well within budget.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_00
 Mm-hmm.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_00
 I guess I should save this, I suppose, huh?

0:17:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_02
 Oops.

0:17:51	None
 Ha-ha-ha.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_03
 And the desktop?

0:18:06	SPEAKER_00
 I just tried that.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_00
 My documents computer.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_00
 My computer.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:18:15	None
 Okay.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_00
 Fine.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_00
 Save.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:19	None
 Good.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_00
 So that's the good news.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_00
 You're going to be popular.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_00
 Mm-hmm.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_00
 Um...

0:18:28	SPEAKER_00
 So that, I think, financing was pretty simple.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_00
 Mm-hmm.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_00
 Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_00
 On production evaluation.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_01
 I'll take my file down so you can bring it up.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_01
 Should be able to get it now.

0:19:00	None
 Okay.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_01
 Why don't you move just to the next slide right away?

0:19:05	SPEAKER_01
 You want to go to the next slide?

0:19:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_01
 Well, obviously my method for the marketing of this thing is first asked the big question.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_01
 Will it sell?

0:19:17	SPEAKER_01
 And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socioeconomic groups and see about any fine-tuning that maybe little things that we haven't thought of.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_01
 We can't accept every suggestion, of course, but maybe we just need to get a few.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_01
 And show the prototype to consider research groups who want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_01
 So we have to get some input from those people.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_01
 And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_01
 And we like it.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_01
 We think it's good.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to get behind it and sell it.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 Next slide, please.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_01
 Now the things that I was thinking and my wish list has really been realized in this prototype.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_01
 I wanted the shape to be biomorphic.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't want anything with angles on all square.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_01
 I wanted it to be comfy and roundy.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_01
 So we've got that.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_01
 The size is small.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_01
 The color is bright and warm, which is what we wanted.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_01
 We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_01
 We'll have the soft buttons.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_01
 And the way this is shaped, even though it's going to be hard plastic, it feels good in your hands.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_01
 So that's nice.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_01
 And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_01
 So paradoxically the other features, in other words, the look, the feel, and the shape, that's what people are going to get in the store.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_01
 They don't have a television in the store.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_01
 They can't play with it.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_01
 So they'll be our main selling points.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_01
 So those have been fulfilled by your prototype.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_01
 And go ahead to the next slide, please.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_01
 So the shape, I think, is a one.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_01
 That's really excellent shape.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_01
 The size is small.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_01
 And these points are in the importance for the marketing.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_01
 These aren't in how I feel.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_01
 I think that it's plenty small enough to sell, but I think the scale is one to seven.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_01
 I think we're right in the middle as far as other competitors.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_01
 And our color, I think, is great.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_01
 The colors are bright and warm, and we really do a great job there.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_01
 And given the constraints that we had, I think we got it as soft as possible.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_01
 And then functionality, I think you did a really good job on functionality.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_01
 Obviously we could have added different functions, but then we disturbed something else.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_01
 So I would say that we got to a five out of seven on functionality.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_01
 So I think that basically we've got a great product, and we can get off and running with it.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_00
 I just realized one thing.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_00
 In the financing, there was no room for our voice recognizer.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_00
 And I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we had what, eight euros, 20 as our cost?

0:22:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_01
 And so we've got four euros to go to spend.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_00
 And then in the same time, we have another 4.3 euros, I mean, 430.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_00
 But we have no way of presenting that to management as a finished product and saying, okay, we always recognize that costs so much.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_00
 So we just have to be aware of that.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_00
 And know whether the 430 will really cover that.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_01
 Well, as we know in today's technological world, you can do just about anything at any price, the problem is quality.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_01
 So we're just going to have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_01
 And it may not be the greatest quality, but it may sell anyway.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_01
 As we've seen with so many of these kind of products.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sorry to interrupt them, but I just remembered that there was no, that was not included, that there was no room for any special features.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_00
 So to be aware of that, you want to go to the next slide, marketing expert?

0:23:33	SPEAKER_00
 Well, isn't this my last slide?

0:23:35	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, it is.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_01
 This is my last slide.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_01
 And I'm supposed to present the scale on the whiteboard.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_01
 And we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_01
 So if you put my last slide back up there.

0:23:57	None
 Oh.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_01
 I got to get.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_00
 Wow.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_00
 Why you need that up?

0:24:06	SPEAKER_01
 Well, because I can't remember what I put on there.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_01
 Now I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_01
 I think you can make it there.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_01
 Alrighty.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_01
 So now we're all supposed to say what we think.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_01
 So on shape.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_01
 I gave it one.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_01
 What would you, one being good and seven being the worst?

0:24:38	SPEAKER_01
 It was okay.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_01
 What do you think the shape is?

0:24:41	SPEAKER_01
 One.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_01
 One.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_01
 And Betsy?

0:24:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_00
 I think shape is one.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_01
 And how about on size?

0:24:54	None
 On size.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_01
 You gave it a four.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_01
 I gave it a four.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_01
 I feel it's just average.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_00
 I think I would give it at least a two.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_00
 One.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_03
 Mm-hmm.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_04
 You and I think it is one.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_01
 It's quite small.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_01
 You're the designer.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_01
 Of course you want to give it one.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_01
 And then how about how are we doing on color?

0:25:23	SPEAKER_01
 Color.

0:25:24	None
 Color.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_02
 I gave it one.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_01
 I really like all those nice bright, warm colors.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_00
 I like the colors.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_04
 One.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_04
 One.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_01
 One.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_01
 One.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_01
 And how about the feel?

0:25:41	SPEAKER_01
 Taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hand.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_00
 I think I will give it a two.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_01
 I gave it a three.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_01
 Two.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_01
 I gave three.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_01
 Three.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe two.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_04
 Two.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_01
 And the next is functionality.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_01
 Where I admit I was a little hard on our team here.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_01
 But.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it's also you can't really try it out.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_00
 The other things you have more, it's more tangible.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_00
 So from that point of view, but, um...

0:26:19	SPEAKER_00
 I'll give it a three.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:23	None
 Two.

0:26:24	None
 Two.

0:26:25	None
 Okay.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_01
 Three.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_01
 Three.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_04
 Well, um...

0:26:32	SPEAKER_01
 It looks like we've got ourselves a pretty good product.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_01
 Um, functionality is the only place where maybe we have to think about maybe having forbid having another meeting.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_01
 But, um...

0:26:56	SPEAKER_01
 Otherwise, I think we're ready to go with this product.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_01
 Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate?

0:27:10	SPEAKER_02
 Uh...

0:27:17	SPEAKER_00
 Here is what we're looking at.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_00
 Uh, satisfaction on, for example, room for creativity.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_00
 Um...

0:27:29	SPEAKER_00
 Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy?

0:27:35	SPEAKER_03
 We can always improve.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_04
 Include some more buttons and the features.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, features.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_04
 We can make the buttons, few buttons smaller.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_04
 Uh, I think they are quite big.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_04
 So I think, I mean, we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case if we want to have more features in that.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_01
 Well, then again, if we're gonna, um...

0:27:59	SPEAKER_01
 Do the speech recognition thing, we're gonna, there's gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the speech.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_01
 So that's where we're gonna have to do, maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons instead of having two mute buttons.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_01
 And, um, then maybe we can do something with the, um...

0:28:24	SPEAKER_01
 The volume control, maybe we can put that all on one button.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_01
 Um...

0:28:31	SPEAKER_01
 And a couple of other, maybe consolidate some of the usage and see what we can do with that.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, obviously, bearing in mind that right now we are, of course, well within the budget and that we still, you know, we probably can't...

0:28:47	SPEAKER_00
 With this particular item, we probably can't just add a whole lot of more things.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_00
 Um, we need the...

0:28:57	SPEAKER_00
 You know, we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recognizer.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_00
 Mm-hmm.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_00
 So the question really is, how do we feel with the project process?

0:29:15	SPEAKER_00
 Um...

0:29:17	SPEAKER_00
 Are we happy with the creativity that has passed here, or we're not happy with the new product we created, or that was created?

0:29:28	SPEAKER_00
 Uh, I think, personally, I think, uh, I'm pretty happy.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_00
 I'm pretty happy with the show now.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_00
 Um...

0:29:34	SPEAKER_00
 That's something I think I can market.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_00
 And then the next question is, are we happy with the leadership of this project?

0:29:42	SPEAKER_00
 Uh...

0:29:43	SPEAKER_01
 I think you've done a good job, Ms. Leedor.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_00
 And I think teamwork, I think, was very, very good.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_00
 I think we were, I think, well, together as a team, yeah.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_00
 Uh-huh.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_00
 And, uh, I think we...

0:29:57	SPEAKER_00
 Are we happy with the means we used, we used whiteboard, we didn't use digital pens, I guess, are these things?

0:30:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, maybe we could have used the whiteboard a little bit more.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_00
 We didn't use that enough.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, we could.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_00
 Uh, it's maybe not in the best position in the room.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_00
 Uh, you know, like, sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_00
 Uh-huh.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_00
 And I think from that point, if you, we sort of ignored it a little bit.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_00
 And we used the slide because it was better position.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I think so.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's true.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's true.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_00
 And, fortunately, we all had slides.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_00
 Presentation, which made it a little easier.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_00
 Uh-huh.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_00
 Um, did we find new ideas?

0:30:34	SPEAKER_00
 I think we did.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_00
 I think we were very good.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think we did, uh, in more than one respect.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_00
 And, uh, so I think we did very well here.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_00
 Are the costs within budget?

0:30:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, yes.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_00
 Uh, is the project evaluated?

0:30:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, yes.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_00
 Uh, so...

0:30:54	SPEAKER_00
 And celebration.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_00
 And celebration.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_00
 If you want to see this.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_01
 Today we have apple juice and after we sell a million of them, we have champagne.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_00
 So, I thank you all very much.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_00
 Um, I think this was very good.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_00
 And, um, I think we did come up with a new product that's, uh, feasible.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_00
 Visible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_00
 Uh-huh.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_00
 So, okay.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_01
 Watch, I have my cord behind you.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:31:30	None
 Okay.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_00
 Oops.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_00
 I always get it on there, but getting it off is...

0:31:37	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, you have time to put me on there.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_01
 But we were told we could end the final meeting at any time.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_01
 Whenever we felt we were friends.

0:31:51	None
 Yeah, because we were friends.

0:31:53	None
 Okay.

0:31:56	None
 Okay.

0:31:59	None
 Okay.

0:32:00	None
 I'm going to get my microphone out for my necklace.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_01
 Now there we go.

0:32:08	None
 Okay.
