0:00:00	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, you're on.

0:00:01	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:00:02	SPEAKER_04
 And you have another room?

0:00:04	SPEAKER_07
 Would you mind telling me again, please?

0:00:06	SPEAKER_07
 I'm always going to write it.

0:00:10	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:00:11	SPEAKER_07
 Now, if the batteries were to go out during the meeting, there's really what do we do?

0:00:22	SPEAKER_07
 Do we have batteries back there?

0:00:24	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:00:25	SPEAKER_07
 And you'll be in your office during this?

0:00:26	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, thank you very much.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_07
 Thanks a lot.

0:00:29	SPEAKER_07
 Would you close the door for me, please?

0:00:30	SPEAKER_07
 Please.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:00:32	None
 Okay.

0:00:33	None
 Thanks.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_07
 So, thanks very much for coming.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_07
 So, let's see.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_07
 So as you know, the meeting today is to benefit from your involvement in the data and all the things that you've been exposed to in these many months.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_07
 And I just put down some ideas.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_07
 You've seen some of this in the email that I sent out earlier.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_07
 And none of these, these are not obligatory topics.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_07
 They're just things that I thought might be useful to discuss just as a way of organizing the discussion.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_07
 But if they're other topics you'd like to discuss, that'd be great, too.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_07
 All right.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_07
 So, it struck me that, you know, we could start out with some sort of general thing about things that you found easier or more difficult with respect to transcribing or checking or using the interface or dealing with a time-insur any aspect of that type.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_07
 And then maybe talk about specific, specific of the data and then maybe talk about aspects of the conventions and the technical setup regarding the auditory image and the interface.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_07
 So, maybe we could just start with issues of the chart type up there at the top of what did you find easiest or most difficult about transcribing the data?

0:01:56	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_04
 One thing that I remember being really difficult at the beginning and it got easier as we went along was acronyms and technical terms because there are so many.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_04
 And it's a field that I'm not really very, I don't know, I don't know very much about this kind of stuff.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_04
 Computers and speech recognition.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_04
 I've never taken classes on it or anything.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_04
 So I found that really hard and I remember transcribing and having a bunch of, you know, every five words would be something I'd put in parentheses because I didn't know what it was.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_04
 So, parentheses meaning uncertainty?

0:02:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_04
 But it's definitely gotten easier because the same things keep getting repeated once you learn what it is and you could say, okay, I know what they meant by that or I know how to spell that now or something like that.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_04
 And the cast of characters that you put up on the web is helpful.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_07
 Okay, good.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_07
 It's sort of like a foreign language, isn't it?

0:02:50	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_07
 Basically, you have these specialized terms for things that I didn't know, needed specialized terms.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_04
 Especially when describing like the setup in this room also and the different types of mics, I don't know.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_04
 And it's hard to tell when people are talking relatively quickly, they just glide over some of the letters, don't fully pronounce them.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_04
 So you can't really tell even if you listen to it ten times.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I usually put most of the acronyms in parentheses because I think it's sort of safe because people can say the acronyms really fast.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_01
 And I figure that even if I think I know exactly what letters they said, it's probably best to put them in parentheses because I probably don't.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_07
 That's not about strategy.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, it's true that I always check the parentheses at the last stage and those are pretty easy to clear in terms of when they're in context, not about strategy.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_05
 Some of them just occurred over and over again.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_05
 So like, PDA.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_05
 Like that.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_05
 Got it easy.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_05
 There was a bunch of them that I suspect in just having repeated often and often, you know, over and over.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_07
 And also when you have the juxtaposition of PDA and PGM, then you know, in context you can tell which one it's yeah, is probably likely to be the one that you had, even though

0:04:09	SPEAKER_04
 I still don't know what they are. I'm going to assume they're microphones of some sort, but that's all.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_07
 Well, these here are the PGMs right there.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_03
 Is anybody wearing one of those awful quote-croned microphones?

0:04:20	SPEAKER_03
 No, you've heard people in the crowd on a pay-ass.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_07
 No, he was telling us before the meeting that they're not in circulation right now that they were unpopular.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_07
 I liked them and I don't like them.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_07
 I thought the quality was good.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_07
 She's cute.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_07
 I wanted to say, he said some more things about that, but I was working on some things.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_07
 About the microphone.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_04
 I can't remember.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_04
 He said that they were designed for a specific size head.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_02
 Oh yeah.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_04
 So if your head happened to be that size and you were fine and if it was bigger than it was like torture.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_04
 Oh right.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_04
 Or I don't know.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_07
 I like them.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_07
 Actually, there's the picture of the crown of Justin on the wall right there.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_07
 So it sort of pokes over your ears from back.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_07
 Right.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_04
 Oh yeah.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that doesn't look so bad, but I guess it depends really.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_07
 So now what about accents?

0:05:13	SPEAKER_03
 Do you have that you find any tough sometimes?

0:05:17	SPEAKER_03
 Some of the German accents can get a little bit daunting.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I forget who it was that I was transcribing, but it was tough to figure out what he was saying at any given point in time and I would just listen to it over and over and over and I'm going, oh my god, my head's going to explode.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_03
 Like not really understanding.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_03
 And so I was getting a little frustrated because I would put a lot of things into parentheses and then go back over it and go back over it again and still, you know, I like to try to clear as much up as I possibly can and I just felt like, you know, with the German accents just for me personally, those were probably the toughest to get around.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_03
 They weren't impossible, but just like they took the most time too.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, it would take maybe twice as long on a given channel speaker who is a German accent and somebody who's, you know, an native English speaker or even Asian, like speaking Asian language I found that easier, you know, that somebody who speaks like Chinese or something.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_07
 What you've studied some languages, which one's cheaper?

0:06:25	SPEAKER_07
 Are you studying it's more romance direction?

0:06:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I studied, I mean, I studied Old English for a while and then I've worked with Larry Heimann on like some of the Bantu languages and, you know, I'm also working with Ian Madison and he's been doing work on the like also some African languages.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_07
 So it's not really, you're not really exposed to German very much.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_03
 No, I mean, I sing in German.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_03
 Ah, interesting.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_03
 Interesting.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I can pronounce it, but I don't know any.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_03
 That's interesting.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_03
 I can do, I can pronounce a lot of languages and I actually just speak them because of singing.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_04
 And then I found the Spanish speakers to be the hardest.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_04
 And the German speakers, I found a little bit easier and I thought maybe that was because I had, I took German for a semester and I had exposure to German because I had a lot of friends who were really into Germany and German language.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_04
 But and I found that I could, if they were pronouncing something in a certain way, I could say, oh, well, that's just the German way of pronouncing this and then I figured out what they were saying.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_04
 But with the Spanish speakers, it was, I've never taken Spanish, even though I've taken French and I speak French fairly well, I found the Spanish to be much harder and maybe also because the level of fluency for the Spanish speakers was a little bit less than the level of fluency of the German speakers that are here.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_01
 If you're talking about who I think you're talking about, are you talking about, um, there's a couple of different Spanish speakers.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_05
 Can we give names?

0:07:49	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_07
 Which probably shouldn't, right?

0:07:51	SPEAKER_07
 Is that?

0:07:52	SPEAKER_07
 It's a good question.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_07
 Um, I can't really answer that.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, well, that was a lot of particular.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_01
 Who I find the hardest to transcribe of all, um, is she Spanish?

0:08:02	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, oh, yeah.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_01
 And, um, and I've taken lots, I'm fluent in Spanish and so, um, when I, when I correct it, I can, I can tell that the person who, um, transcribed it before me probably didn't speak Spanish because I can catch a lot of things like, like, no, that's not what she said.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_01
 I can tell she's pronouncing, pronouncing it the way that if you bet it from a, you know, a Spanish speaker's mind that you would, you know, pronounce it the way that you would pronounce it in Spanish.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_01
 At the same time, I can't get most of it because I find it one of the hardest ones to transcribe.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_07
 Well, what you can see is that it's, it's her lack of, of English fluency.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I think so, yeah.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, that's, that's really interesting.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_07
 I do find that the German tends to be easier for me than, than the others because of my exposure and interest in German.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_03
 But, um, maybe I haven't transcribed this Spanish one, and I don't know if I have.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_07
 I suspect you haven't because this was earlier on that we had a lot of, actually, she, she was in the middle phase, I would say, we had another Spanish speaker who was earlier who was also difficult.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, he was hard.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, that's really interesting.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_05
 He got easier though because he started, like, he would say certain words over and over

0:09:12	SPEAKER_04
 and, and you got to know his pronunciation a bit. Yeah, so he said, sign you.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, it sounds like sign.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_04
 I'm saying signal.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I remember that.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_04
 And I can't describe it as signal.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_04
 The way he said mixed was really strange.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, mixed, mixed, yeah, for something.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_07
 Which was, you know, you could predict it.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, if you knew, especially because also in the beginning meetings, I mean, he'd say something and no one in the meeting would understand.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_04
 And then everyone would say, what was that again?

0:09:35	SPEAKER_04
 And then they'd come up and say, no, I said so I could.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_02
 That was interesting.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I mean, he was never, like, it was never up to, like, a native speaker, but, like, it got a little easier.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_05
 I remember the game you were just sort of like, you were beating your head against the ball.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, I went crazy.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_04
 I think that better.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_04
 I would skip doing that portion for as long as I could because I just couldn't deal with it.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I had the same experience.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_07
 And actually, sometimes when people lack a certain level of fluency, you can ask them themselves, what did you say there?

0:10:14	SPEAKER_00
 And they can't tell you.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_07
 I think it's sort of a general variability when it's not, when you're learning a language and you have it gotten to a certain level.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_07
 Also, I wonder if it's partly that Spanish has different pronunciations in different regions.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, do you think that maybe, I mean, being, I mean, not that I would know that.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_07
 But I just wondered if, you know, she was from probably continental Spain versus, you know, other Spanish.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_07
 I wonder if that would have a contributing factor.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_07
 I don't know.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_04
 I like the region.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_04
 I don't have an idea about Spain, but I know that in France, for example, Paris and France is much easier for me to understand because I learned it versus France in like Marseille or in the south or in like the province, like the villages and the south.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_04
 It's really hard to understand.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_05
 Or in Quebec, right?

0:11:04	SPEAKER_05
 In Canada, it's different.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_05
 It's different.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_07
 A lot of pronunciations are different.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_07
 And in my case with, with German, I, a certain region, and I do well.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_07
 And then get farther away from that region.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_07
 And I noticed it's more and more difficult.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_03
 Is there another language that's spoken in Spain too?

0:11:19	SPEAKER_03
 What am I thinking?

0:11:20	SPEAKER_03
 Castilian?

0:11:21	SPEAKER_03
 Castilian.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_03
 And Catalan.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_03
 Catalan.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe, I mean, depending on where she is, like maybe.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_07
 But she was also very low volume.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_07
 And didn't say a lot.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, I totally agree.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_07
 This was a difficult person to understand.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the last one I did, she actually said a lot.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_01
 It was kind of, it was very hard to transcribe.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_01
 You know, I just think that her fluency in English wasn't very, very high up there.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_01
 So it was really difficult.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_01
 But I mean, I did find that knowing Spanish helped me a lot.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_01
 I can mention that.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_01
 I can mention that.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_01
 A lot of things that the other transcriber had put in parentheses.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_01
 I was like, I can see how you couldn't understand that.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_01
 But I think I know what she's doing.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_04
 I think I know the mistake she's making.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_04
 That's really good.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_04
 Because that's definitely something that I wouldn't be able to do.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_07
 I couldn't do it in Spanish.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_07
 I found myself doing that somewhat in German.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_07
 German.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_04
 There were problems even with English speakers though.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, not in their level of fluency, obviously.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_04
 But in some people tend to mumble.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_04
 That's right.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_04
 And it's hard to catch what it is, because it goes by really quickly and you can't really tell.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_04
 What they're laughing when they're talking.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_04
 That too.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_04
 That too.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_04
 Or just, I don't know.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_04
 And some people tend to get interrupted more.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_04
 I know that's not something that the person themselves can control.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_03
 And people talk over one another constantly.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_03
 Like there's this whole barrage of voices coming from everywhere.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_03
 It's like, oh my god, what's going on.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_04
 Especially when you were using the mics that weren't the head mounted mics.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_04
 Oh.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_04
 And there was input from other people on the same channel as the person that was talking.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_07
 We had the pulse for a brief.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_07
 And then sometimes people would wear these around their necks, which would mean really basically the problem that you're saying is getting input from others and also it varying when they change their head position.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_05
 A big and I think the transcriptions improved immensely exponentially after it was able to sort of isolate a single person onto a single channel.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, excellent.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_05
 Absolutely.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, there's no question.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_07
 Yes.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_07
 So that was your time that early on, the change into channel trends.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_01
 You guys didn't have one channel purpose before.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_04
 You had to rib in for everybody and you could switch signals, like you could listen to a different one, but you couldn't really...

0:13:43	SPEAKER_04
 Well, could you...

0:13:44	SPEAKER_04
 You couldn't do that very much.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_04
 You couldn't visually do it.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_05
 And you had to mark interruptions by a slash.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_05
 That's right.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_04
 And it was very hard to be precise about it.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_04
 And it was very hard to tell.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_04
 I had so much trouble at the very beginning trying to figure out who was who.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_04
 Because there's so many men and so few women, the women were easy to figure out who was who.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_04
 And then the men, all their voices sounded the same except I think there was one British English speaker and that was easy but...

0:14:09	SPEAKER_04
 Well, that's difficult.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_05
 You know what?

0:14:11	SPEAKER_05
 There might be a gender thing there though too because I think as women it might be easier to differentiate...

0:14:15	SPEAKER_05
 Well there were fewer women too.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_05
 But I would have a man transcribing all the guys would have had an easier time.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_05
 Like if you had transcribed it, you would have had an easier time differentiating them.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know why.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_05
 That would be true.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_00
 That's just...

0:14:26	SPEAKER_05
 It's wonderful.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_05
 You want to have a gender difference there?

0:14:28	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_05
 I'm thinking about it as a psychologist I suppose.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_02
 It's possible.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it's...

0:14:32	SPEAKER_03
 Oh yeah.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's possible.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_03
 I was just going to say something.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_03
 I was going to say that.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, it's easier for people to mimic like the timbre of somebody's voice if it's the same...

0:14:42	SPEAKER_03
 If that person's voice is the same...

0:14:44	SPEAKER_03
 If that person is the same sex as you.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe like implicitly people pay attention more closely to speakers of the same sex.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_03
 Hmm.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if that's actually true but I'm just...

0:14:59	SPEAKER_03
 During that out there.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_03
 It's interesting.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_03
 I have an interesting research project.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, it seems like it's related to this production idea of how you internalize what you're externalizing in a way.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but it definitely got much better when you match each other.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_05
 Oh yeah.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_05
 So it'd be much easier.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_07
 And you've also gone through...

0:15:22	SPEAKER_07
 They've been here since the beginning.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_07
 You've also gone through the introduction of the pre-segmentation and the kind of thing.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_07
 So initially they had to actually mark all the timbens themselves as well.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_05
 That's...

0:15:34	SPEAKER_05
 It's just a time.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_04
 It's just a time.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_05
 I find that I have to adjust the timbens a lot anyway.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I'm always adjusting timbens.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_05
 Not for the end of the utterance but for the beginning.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, really?

0:15:46	SPEAKER_05
 The beginning...

0:15:47	SPEAKER_05
 The person started to say something.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_05
 It's a very slight difference and then the timbens starts.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, that happens a lot.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_05
 So you have to just move it back a little bit.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_05
 And I think you mentioned at some point that you wanted a little pad of time anyway.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_07
 It doesn't hurt to have a pad.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_07
 It's nicer to have a pad than not.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_07
 And that's...

0:16:03	SPEAKER_07
 I feel like...

0:16:05	SPEAKER_01
 I always wonder about the timbens.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I usually end up adjusting them a little bit.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, definitely when something's cut off at the beginning or the end.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_01
 But also sometimes there's just like huge pads of air before or after that I don't really feel is necessary for that segment.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_01
 And I usually shrink a little bit.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I always have to cut off my pads at the end.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_06
 I don't have so much problem at the beginning, but...

0:16:30	SPEAKER_04
 A breath or a breath or nothing.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_03
 There's nothing going on.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_03
 At the beginning it seems to happen when voicing occurs later.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you know, with fricatives a lot.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, with fricatives and with like...

0:16:42	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, like it doesn't happen with...

0:16:44	SPEAKER_03
 Like, so much because you've got the prevoicing before the consonant actually.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_04
 Although I found one and actually I was just working right before this meeting.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_04
 One word someone said great.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_04
 And the...

0:16:57	SPEAKER_04
 The G, it was pronounced as a K.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_04
 So it was unvoiced and the part of the R was cut off in the beginning.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_04
 And then you...

0:17:03	SPEAKER_04
 It sounded like great if you just listened to that time and it still sounded like great.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_04
 But if you listened to it right before you could hear a little bit of the K or whatever and a little bit of the R.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_04
 So I don't know.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_04
 Usually it's not...

0:17:16	SPEAKER_04
 Usually that doesn't happen, but this time it did.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_05
 So for the non-linguists what's fricative?

0:17:21	SPEAKER_05
 Oh.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_03
 It's like...

0:17:24	SPEAKER_03
 Or...

0:17:25	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, okay.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's a sound.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_03
 It's like the noisy...

0:17:32	SPEAKER_03
 Like airflow ones where you've got like a stoppage in your mouth.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_03
 Like, oh, you're like...

0:17:37	SPEAKER_04
 But it's not completely blocking the airflow.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_01
 You can sort of keep it going a little bit.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, like a...

0:17:42	SPEAKER_06
 Or a cut that just stops.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_05
 Got it.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_05
 Sorry.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_05
 I guess I'd be only non-linguist.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_07
 I'm sort of a hybrid.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_07
 So I...

0:17:51	SPEAKER_07
 I appreciate having them do this.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, right.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_07
 Have you run into places I run into a couple where actually the word was totally different when you adjusted the time.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_07
 And if you have that happen, yeah.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_03
 It's fascinating.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_03
 I like that.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, it's really fun.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_03
 And it's so much dangerous the entire utterance.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, it does.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_04
 Completely.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I don't remember the words exactly.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_04
 It's a shame.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_04
 There was one that was a whole sentence was broken up in the middle and there was a little like millisecond of break in the middle.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_04
 And if you connected it all together, it completely changed what was right before it and what was right after it.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_04
 It was written as something else and then it became a word together from what was before and after and then with this little tiny millisecond pause.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_04
 So I guess...

0:18:32	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I guess when we talk in between different segments of the word, maybe there's pauses somehow, I guess, or you can...

0:18:40	SPEAKER_04
 We stop voicing sometimes.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_04
 Or something like that.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_04
 It's probably like inaudible for us.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_04
 But...

0:18:48	SPEAKER_04
 And maybe the pause was just so short that it made up a pause.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know if that's the make any sense, but...

0:18:54	SPEAKER_07
 There are sometimes when there have been words that they just pause right in the middle of here.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_04
 It's on purpose, though.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_07
 Or not.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_07
 Well, I'm sure sometimes on purpose, but sometimes there just be saying something, especially people who have really longation in their style.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_07
 That's really fast.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_07
 The nating.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_07
 It's not a great example, but...

0:19:20	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_07
 It's funny how...

0:19:26	SPEAKER_07
 It's funny to me that something like that.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_07
 You just change one little boundary and suddenly the whole meaning changes and I run across

0:19:32	SPEAKER_06
 that also.

0:19:33	None
 Yeah. Yeah, that is true.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_01
 Would you want a transcription of something like that of a big pause in between in the middle of a word or just leave it as fascinating?

0:19:46	SPEAKER_07
 What I've done, it's very rare.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, when I run across it.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_07
 And maybe there are times that I haven't detected it and I haven't looked at everything.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_07
 I've probably looked at at least 80% of the data all the way through every meeting, about 80% of the stuff that I cleared so far.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_07
 And you guys are getting so good that it's like I can get through them faster and then I'm getting to the point where I maybe don't have to go through them all the way.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_07
 So it's like we've gotten to a level, it's just really great of preprecision that it takes a lot of a load off of me.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_07
 And so I'm not going to be checking them all.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_07
 I don't think through the whole rest of the project.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_07
 But certainly spot checking.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_07
 But those that I have found that way to me, I think the most sensible way to handle it from my perspective was to treat it as a pronunciation situation.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_07
 So just to mark then fascinating and then put PR in.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_07
 That was really pretty.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_07
 Interrupted by a pause or some kind of other gloss like that.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_07
 I think PR dot dot fascinating.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_04
 I mean pronunciation convention.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry, what was this?

0:20:54	SPEAKER_04
 I get confused with pronunciation like when there's a strange pronunciation that I want to mark.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_04
 Because I think in the beginning did we do the strange pronunciation and then write PR in and what it really was meant to be.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_04
 And now we're doing the normal word and then inside the brackets what it sounded like.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_04
 We did a switch, right?

0:21:13	SPEAKER_04
 Or not.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know if it's just me that's confused.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_05
 I never occurred to me, but now that you're mentioning it, yeah, possibly.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_05
 There was an adjustment.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_07
 And I switched them all all the way at this point.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_04
 So the convention as it stands now is write the word as it is normally conventionally spelled in English with a little post-trophy or whatever.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_04
 That's right.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_07
 And then the bracket's what it is.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_07
 So OK is a very easy example.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_07
 In person says OK.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_07
 It's OK with a hatch and then PRN and then OK or whatever it is.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_05
 OK.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_05
 I think Nelson's the only one who...

0:21:48	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, Morgan.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_05
 You guys call him Morgan.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_05
 He's the only one who ever did that, I think.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_05
 OK.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_05
 He does it a lot.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_03
 And some people just say OK.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_07
 That's true.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_07
 And of course, there's also this other reduction that we've done in terms of not capture in every time person says and versus and versus, you know, whatever all the different ways of reducing and because you can assume that the speech recognition pronunciation models will handle certain amount of reductions of these types and the same thing for the versus the, that there are those known variants and what A versus exactly.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_07
 And that they should be able to handle themselves.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_07
 And that we assume also that for discourse purposes those distinctions are not really the focus right now and those distinctions could be added later if needed but it's unlikely that they would be in a so time consuming.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_07
 So we've made these simplifying assumptions with that and so then you begin to think, well, what about OK?

0:22:46	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, maybe OK is an appropriate variant for OK and it wouldn't be necessary to mark those either.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_07
 So it's...

0:22:53	SPEAKER_07
 Definitely there's a choice of how far you go with that and whether OK is enough of a variant, you know, this is a case where I appreciate it when people mark those kinds of things but I sort of figure that that's not as far away from OK is OK so it's not quite so but I don't change it back if it's there.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_03
 I think with like some of them like, you know, with the difference between Z and the, you can you can distinguish very definitively like what context they're going to be used in.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_03
 Like you would say the apple because it's the plus then the next word starts with the vowel or the cat because it's next.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_04
 There's a study done on when people say, and when people say, um, yeah, I'm sure there's content and contextual variation and it's predictable apparently I haven't read the...

0:23:43	SPEAKER_01
 I was trying to figure that out myself a couple times.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_01
 It's really interesting and I couldn't get anything.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_01
 I should have looking at all the as of the as and as like, oh this would be hard to do.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_04
 And on that sort of similar topic, I just thought of something that's been hard for me sometimes is you can have a pronunciation of the word A as a and then you can have a like pause or whatever as a and sometimes it's hard to tell what the person meant.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_04
 Aren't they mean like they're pausing or did they mean like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_04
 That's right.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_04
 You can kind of tell from the context but sometimes it's hard.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I came up a couple of times.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_07
 I agree and when I'm totally in doubt if there's a case where it really could be either and I could flip a coin, I'll choose the one that would make syntactically the most sense, given that it's out, they're being fluent about it.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_03
 Sometimes I'll put in like a bracket like, you know, orthographic A slash UH, like if I'm really like a campus, yeah, kind of go well, there's two.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_03
 So here.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_07
 I must be really rare though, I haven't run across that often.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_04
 It's really, yeah, relatively rare.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I mean, I can only think of like two or three occasions where I sat and thought about it for a while.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_04
 Other times just you figure, you look at it, what's the context.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_04
 It's okay.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_07
 Right.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_07
 Well, let's see now.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_07
 There's another method like what I want to ask you at some point, just to encourage to me.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_07
 I'd like to ask you the following question maybe you can have this in the back of your mind.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_07
 Like, you know, what sorts of hypothesis, your hypothesis about the, you know, time to find the distributional explanations for some of these things.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_07
 What kind of a hypothesis has this caused you, I mean, don't want to have you give away a paper topic that you want to explore.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_07
 But it's interesting hypotheses that have been suggested to you by looking at the data, that kind of thing maybe at some point.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_07
 So, and I also want to say that I'd like to meet again also next week.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_07
 And I don't know if this is a good time frame.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_07
 Maybe it would be good to have it an hour later or, I don't know, I mean, could do anything.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_07
 This time is fine for me.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, this is a good time for me.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_05
 It should be.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_05
 I know I have something in the morning, which I don't normally have.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_05
 I don't remember off the top of my head when it ends.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_05
 I'll let you know if it'll be a problem, but it should be okay.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_07
 2.30 should be late enough.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_07
 Excellent.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_07
 Because we could probably move it one hour later.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, I think it was.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just saying maybe 15 minutes later would help me a little bit just because I have a class up at one hour or 15 minutes before the point.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, I see.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_07
 What was the wait today?

0:26:23	SPEAKER_07
 You did really well.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I took the bus for part of the way.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_03
 You did.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_03
 But that might help me just a little bit because then I know I'm going to be hobbling a little

0:26:31	SPEAKER_07
 slowly. Would anybody be constrained by having it be a full half hour later?

0:26:36	SPEAKER_07
 No.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_07
 No.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_05
 And final question.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_05
 So we'll mistreat time.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, that's right.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_07
 I might.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_07
 I might.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_04
 She said mistreat.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_04
 Oh.

0:26:49	None
 I have half hour, let's go break.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_01
 That's some good motivation to not start a half hour.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_04
 We could just ask the someone like the friend us person or Lila to like set aside a little bit.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_07
 For us to.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, that's true.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, they would.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_07
 That's not a bad solution.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_05
 It's not going to be birthday cake.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_05
 So.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_05
 So we'll survive.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_04
 That's right.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_04
 This is very important.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_07
 These things also.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_07
 So, um, oh, uh, then I was going to ask you, what about an hour later?

0:27:20	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, if we had those things an hour later, like people, okay, that's fine too.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_07
 Good.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_07
 So I'll sell.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_07
 Now, I wanted to say, you've been through a couple of different, uh, improvements in the methods, uh, presuppmentation.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_07
 There was another improvement, uh, another improvement in that, well, let's ask if it was an improvement from your standpoint, the Tiger Fish, um, approach.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_07
 So, uh, moving from having the first transcription done by an external service and then you correcting that versus doing the initial transcription yourselves.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_07
 How, how, how, how do you, and so I think you, I think you, did you, I already have,

0:27:58	SPEAKER_01
 I have ever done one from an external. I, uh, I feel like they've all been done probably by another transcriber.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_03
 You talk about the IBM ones.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_07
 IBM or if it was dashed TF.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_07
 That's the Tiger Fish.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_01
 Again, then I guess I have maybe the one I'm working on now.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_01
 I just tell you something.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_01
 They have different, definitely different style, right?

0:28:18	SPEAKER_01
 Do they end all the mall and dots, like dots, like, there's a lot of that.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_01
 And they capitalize like every single first.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_04
 And they put, um, not parentheses, what's it called?

0:28:27	SPEAKER_04
 Punctuation after brackets.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, and then I'm doing that right now.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, right, laugh period.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_01
 Which makes those sense to be.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_01
 No, it doesn't look like that.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_03
 Exactly.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_03
 Well, they're not linguists.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_03
 So, if I could be completely frank, I really didn't like the IBM ones.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, good to know.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_03
 I found them to be just, I just, I ended up basically redoing them.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_03
 Like from start to finish.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_03
 So when I was checking them, like, it would take me basically as long as it would have taken me just to transcribe it by myself.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_07
 Wow.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_04
 Wow.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_04
 I think it was a little bit faster than just transcribing it, but I definitely saw a lot of, there was a lot of errors that are not in the Tiger Fish once.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, Tiger Fish are better.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_04
 And they just have better intuitions, or I don't know what, but what are the two differences?

0:29:17	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_07
 I'm not sure if you had an IBM one, so this was earlier.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_01
 So do I have a Tiger Fish one right now?

0:29:22	SPEAKER_01
 If it says, probably do.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_00
 Uh-huh.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_01
 So I don't think IBM are like, the IBM ones were the ones that came in huge, huge paragraphs, huh?

0:29:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_05
 So you didn't get one wrong, just saying.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_04
 You know, they don't show up in Tiger Fish, too, because I think I've had a good time in Tiger Fish.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but they're not like, they break them up.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I can remember.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_01
 I used to see.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, really?

0:29:45	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_05
 I think they sort of break them down.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_01
 Do they get them, um, it's, they don't have like an interface, right?

0:29:51	SPEAKER_07
 They just, no.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_07
 In either case, and I'm thinking, I'm thinking, you're causing me to think back over what the differences were and then what they got in IBM.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_01
 They just have, they just have it segmented.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_01
 You can tell because sometimes they have it so wrong and it's like, well, if you had just listened to what was before.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_01
 They don't have that.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_07
 Right.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_07
 There's also some, if he knows about how, we're not sure really how Tiger Fish does it, you know, the methodology.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_07
 How do they do this?

0:30:18	SPEAKER_07
 Because sometimes you'll have a, a same word.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_07
 And I've seen this like within, well, within the single turn, they will be spelled in three different ways.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_07
 And it's like, no, is this the same person who's kind of forgetful or is it that they have some people doing it together?

0:30:30	SPEAKER_07
 You know, maybe it's parallel.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_07
 Maybe they're all doing it in parallel and one falls behind the other one.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_04
 And they don't, one person doesn't listen to all the channels of one meeting, right?

0:30:37	SPEAKER_04
 They can't get clues from the other channels.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_07
 Well, you know, the way they're listening to it is they get, they get, it's linearized.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_07
 So if you picture what we have on the screen, you know, there's this block and it goes over, I'm doing it from my perspective.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_07
 It goes over here and stops and this person starts to talk and it goes over here.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_07
 And then you have an overlap over here.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_07
 And so what they would get is this block from the first guy, this block from the second guy.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_07
 And then the top of the overlap and then the second guy in the overlap.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_07
 And then it would move on.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_07
 So it's sort of like this, you know, you go this way as much as you can and you cycle through there and then you go up to this block.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_07
 So they hear all the channels at once like you guys were saying at the first door?

0:31:15	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_07
 Let's see, they hear them, oh, they hear them separately in two chunks, but then sometimes they get confused about who the foreground speaker is because they're not being told who the foreground speaker is.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_07
 You know, and especially you can see if you have like four speakers, be reasonable, you could maybe find a way of doing that with nine speakers.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_07
 So what they get is they get a beep that tells them when there's something that they think that the pre-segmenter thought there should be transcribed in there.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_07
 And so they'll get, and it's numbered so that we end up with the same number of transcribed slots.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_07
 Exactly.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_07
 Because the first time when we didn't have them numbered, we ended up with a couple extra segments that were transcribed.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_07
 It's hard to patch the whole thing back together because when it comes back to our end, it's just as long string of things that they've partitioned according to the tape that they were given.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_07
 Because they don't have digital interface either, so it's audio tape.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, wow.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_07
 And they type it on.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_07
 And then it comes back to us and Adam and Tilo have a program, they put it back together into our interface format and then we use it.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_07
 But there are cases where you'll get a segment and it's someone else's utterance, and that's because that was overlapping with someone else, and this is the weaker speaker of the two.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_07
 You'll have two totally parallel renditions of the same thing.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_07
 Because it's just, so what they get is, is they get some like beep one, and then they get beep two, beep three, check what does the numbers.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_07
 And cycle through.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, so they don't, do they know the names of the speakers?

0:32:49	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_05
 And they don't know which channel is supposed to be interesting things where there would be a misunderstanding about like Morgan would be speaking, but it'd be on your channel.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_05
 Yes, exactly.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_05
 This is clearly not a woman's speaker.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_00
 That's quite right.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_00
 And that's why they do that.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_05
 It seems more reasonable that they'd make a mistake like that if they had no idea.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_04
 It must take them a really long time to do these.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_07
 They're very fast.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_04
 It's amazing.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_07
 It's so hard.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_07
 It turns out that they're really much faster than the other approaches we've used.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_07
 We don't know exactly how they do it.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_07
 And I think that that's by intention, not just me, the things.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_07
 That's the, prior to early, it's very competitive business and they probably don't want to leak their seats.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_07
 Say too much about it.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_07
 But they're very fast.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_04
 It's so.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I definitely prefer not doing transcript.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I liked transcribing because I felt like I was much closer to the data.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_04
 And I had a lot more ideas like you're saying hypotheses of what's going on.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_04
 But it took a really long time and I'd get frustrated with it.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_04
 And I think that I would lose my, I don't know, I would not be as thorough, not be as careful.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_04
 Excellent.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_07
 You miss it.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I see.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_01
 I like transcribing.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_01
 I, you know, I feel like it was more personal.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_01
 I was.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_01
 It was more personal.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_01
 You know, this is sort of just, you know, correcting other.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_01
 I feel like I'm just sort of like correcting a test or something now.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_01
 You know, that's interesting.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, interesting.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_01
 But I mean, it's still, it's still cool.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_01
 But yeah, I did like actually doing the transcribing.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_04
 You don't tend to notice as much.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think checking as you do transcribing because it's already there.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_01
 So you don't have to pay as much attention.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_01
 And when you're, when you're just checking, you're usually just looking for certain things that you know are going to come up.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_01
 And I usually assume that the words are mostly right.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_01
 Although I, you know, I go through and I look and make sure all the words are right.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_01
 But usually it's like punctuation and capitalization and other things that end up changing.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_01
 And time ends, yeah.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_03
 I guess I'm such a perfectionist that I sort of combine the two when I'm checking.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_03
 Like I act as though I'm transcribing it.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_03
 And so yeah, I really do.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_03
 Like I tend to take a little longer maybe than other people doing checking.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_03
 But like I'm like ultra careful.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_03
 This is how I am.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_03
 But like I, I think I really like think of it in terms of re transcribing it almost.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_03
 And I only, you know, so like I change time bends a lot.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_03
 And then like we'll change what people write like for whatever words they write a lot.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_03
 Like, so I guess I don't see too much of a difference.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_03
 But that's just because it's me.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_03
 Like I think I like checking more for that reason because then it's sort of, it's like, it's a little helpful.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_03
 Like kind of, you know, somebody's helping me a little bit, but I'm actually doing the work anyway.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_03
 It's kind of how I see it.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_04
 One thing that's annoying, I think with checking is that a lot of times in the meetings, you tend to have one or two people who talk a lot and the rest of the people just sit there until it's their turn to give their little report or whatever.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_04
 And yet you have to check the channels for if they did back channels or if they did other things that you need to encode that weren't on the pre-secondary.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_04
 But sometimes it's not visually easy.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_04
 And so I'm, sometimes I debate with myself whether it's really worth it to sit there and listen to the whole thing or risk missing a little bit and doing it visually.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_04
 It's hard to decide sometimes.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_07
 And this is when you crank up the visual.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_01
 Well, sometimes when you crank up the visual, all it gives you is the background speaker.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_04
 That's the thing.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_07
 It's true, which is a bit harder to say.

0:36:39	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, that's right.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_07
 Well, it's a judgment call.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_07
 And you can also say, well, if the back channels were so low on volume that they weren't visually obvious, then you can say, well, it's reasonable not to worry about them.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_01
 But also if they have it all pre-segmented and they can only hear the segments, they often miss what's in between because they didn't even have the option of listening to what's in between.

0:37:02	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_01
 So, and you know, the segmenter usually misses little things like, mm-hmm.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_04
 And even bigger things.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_01
 Sometimes the segmenter will.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_04
 You said things that weren't caught on the pre-segmenter, like whispers kind of, just like, oh, that's interesting or something like that.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_03
 Or like little size or like in breaths, like as though you're going to start speaking.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_03
 Which I feel is important because it means that somebody is about to interject something but then they decide for whatever reason that they're not going to.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_03
 And oftentimes I find that the segmenter will miss those kind of things, those kind of vocal cues.

0:37:36	SPEAKER_03
 And sometimes even laughs.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_03
 Breathless especially.

0:37:39	SPEAKER_03
 Oh yeah.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_01
 I usually take out, I usually don't put in any of the breaths unless they're laughs.

0:37:45	SPEAKER_01
 I usually don't transcribe the in breaths or things like that.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_04
 I don't either.

0:37:49	SPEAKER_04
 But I mean, I don't take them out authority there.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_05
 If it sounds like a ton, I've transcribed yons.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_05
 Mm-hmm.

0:37:55	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_05
 You can hear those like, mm-hmm.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_00
 You know, it's like that.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_05
 Well, it's communicative.

0:38:01	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:38:02	SPEAKER_05
 Or when it's a laugh, I mean, often in the tiger fish, it would say breath.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_05
 It's a laugh, yeah.

0:38:09	SPEAKER_05
 Because everyone's laughing.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_05
 Someone has just said something funny and everyone else is laughing in the right person.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_04
 It's like, but it's not an actual laugh.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_04
 It's not a very committed laugh.

0:38:19	SPEAKER_05
 It's like, yeah.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I guess I'll laugh because everyone else is laughing.

0:38:24	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:38:25	SPEAKER_07
 Have you noticed that the tiger fish uses cough a lot where they just really cough in the throat?

0:38:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_04
 It just fixed that.

0:38:36	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:38:37	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, it's fun.

0:38:38	SPEAKER_07
 This has cost me to wonder.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_07
 So, in tiger fish ones, do you find that where they have, like, dots, because the segments they didn't hear, that you add...

0:38:48	SPEAKER_07
 You probably do add things in those places where it's...

0:38:52	SPEAKER_07
 Where nothing is transcribed, really, because they didn't even hear it.

0:38:56	SPEAKER_04
 You mean in between the segments that they did transcribe?

0:38:58	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:38:59	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:39:00	SPEAKER_01
 That's where you've tried to find...

0:39:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you find little lost words in the middle.

0:39:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:39:05	SPEAKER_04
 It depends on the person.

0:39:07	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, some people don't tend to do...

0:39:10	SPEAKER_04
 Aren't that involved in the meeting or something, and they don't tend to say as much.

0:39:14	SPEAKER_04
 Backchannels or whatever.

0:39:16	SPEAKER_04
 And some people...

0:39:17	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I remember transcribing one person.

0:39:20	SPEAKER_04
 All they did was clear their throat and breathe.

0:39:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:39:23	SPEAKER_00
 And then my digits and then it was like...

0:39:25	SPEAKER_04
 Go behind them.

0:39:26	SPEAKER_02
 I'm gonna be talking about it.

0:39:28	SPEAKER_04
 But there's some people tend to...

0:39:31	SPEAKER_04
 It's really cute, actually.

0:39:34	SPEAKER_04
 Other than there are some people who are, even if they're not actually speaking, you can tell they're more involved or interested or something, because they're always...

0:39:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, really.

0:39:43	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:39:44	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_07
 I just occurred to me.

0:39:46	SPEAKER_07
 This is a different kind of question.

0:39:48	SPEAKER_07
 But I, from having listened to all these people, I mean, and it is kind of abnormal to be listening to them as if they're talking into your ear really.

0:39:55	SPEAKER_07
 You know, it's really unusual acoustic circumstances.

0:39:59	SPEAKER_07
 I sort of end up feeling like I know these people better than I really do.

0:40:03	SPEAKER_07
 It's like you go out to tea and there they are.

0:40:04	SPEAKER_07
 And how you were so funny in that meeting.

0:40:07	SPEAKER_07
 It has this sort of unusual dynamic, because I'm privy to information, which really by all rights I shouldn't be, except, of course, they agreed.

0:40:14	SPEAKER_07
 They signed.

0:40:15	SPEAKER_00
 They were there.

0:40:16	SPEAKER_07
 But it's sort of an unusual relationship to say, you know, if you're in the meeting yourself, then of course you'd have access to all this information and all your inferences about whether they're funny or not funny or whatever.

0:40:29	SPEAKER_04
 I remember from the very beginning, I would go to tea and start recognizing voices.

0:40:34	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, that'd be a lot of fun.

0:40:35	SPEAKER_04
 And please turn around and be like, wait, that person doesn't look anything like I imagine.

0:40:39	SPEAKER_03
 You know who I kept wanting to meet was Basqara.

0:40:43	SPEAKER_03
 He's on campus.

0:40:44	SPEAKER_03
 I found this out.

0:40:45	SPEAKER_07
 Is he really?

0:40:46	SPEAKER_07
 He is such a nice voice.

0:40:47	SPEAKER_03
 I really like his voice.

0:40:48	SPEAKER_03
 I like him wanting to be.

0:40:49	SPEAKER_03
 And then John told me that he's not around anymore.

0:40:54	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, but he is.

0:40:55	SPEAKER_07
 I actually wanted to hike with him two weeks, three weeks ago.

0:40:58	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, cool.

0:40:59	SPEAKER_07
 Just curious.

0:41:00	SPEAKER_07
 Nice guy.

0:41:01	SPEAKER_05
 I just want to know what Liz looked like.

0:41:03	SPEAKER_05
 I've never gotten to see her.

0:41:05	SPEAKER_05
 She's here.

0:41:06	SPEAKER_02
 She's got a nice voice.

0:41:07	SPEAKER_05
 I know she's here.

0:41:08	SPEAKER_05
 I know she's a big part of the institute, right?

0:41:10	SPEAKER_07
 So, yeah, I'm sure you've seen her.

0:41:13	SPEAKER_05
 I must have.

0:41:14	SPEAKER_05
 I just don't know what she looks like.

0:41:16	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:41:17	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I think she's got a nice voice.

0:41:19	SPEAKER_05
 But anyway.

0:41:20	SPEAKER_05
 She always tends to get drunk.

0:41:22	SPEAKER_05
 Don't you always say nice things about these people?

0:41:24	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:41:25	SPEAKER_07
 I also find that if someone sits there and there's this one who doesn't say much, but she just always pleasant.

0:41:35	SPEAKER_07
 And kind of a smiling voice and she laughs.

0:41:37	SPEAKER_00
 What difference?

0:41:38	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I mean, it's like, actually, she's just so pleasant.

0:41:44	SPEAKER_07
 And it adds a lot.

0:41:45	SPEAKER_07
 Just by virtue of that, people will talk in these technical things.

0:41:48	SPEAKER_07
 But she'll say something technical and then laugh.

0:41:51	SPEAKER_07
 It's very interesting.

0:41:52	SPEAKER_07
 The only thing you can get through these things.

0:41:54	SPEAKER_04
 This really makes it a lot nicer to transcribe because there can be a lot of heated discussions about these reg technical issues and people have their opinions.

0:42:04	SPEAKER_04
 And then you can, it's really nice to have a little bit of humor or a little bit of break away from that because it's hard to sit there and let's see.

0:42:12	None
 But don't you see you're being rude to this person?

0:42:14	SPEAKER_03
 I know.

0:42:15	SPEAKER_03
 This person.

0:42:16	SPEAKER_03
 That nice?

0:42:17	SPEAKER_03
 I start kind of making mental friends.

0:42:19	SPEAKER_03
 Just like, I really like that person.

0:42:23	SPEAKER_07
 I'm going to be his or her friend.

0:42:27	SPEAKER_07
 I agree with you.

0:42:28	SPEAKER_07
 It's really interesting.

0:42:30	SPEAKER_07
 It's a persona.

0:42:31	SPEAKER_07
 You get this.

0:42:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:42:33	SPEAKER_04
 You definitely get an image of, especially if you can relate it to what the person, what you assume the person is interested in academically.

0:42:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:42:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:42:44	SPEAKER_03
 Some of that computer stuff.

0:42:45	SPEAKER_03
 I just, oh my god.

0:42:46	SPEAKER_03
 I'll just sit there like going, oh, it's going right over my head.

0:42:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:42:52	SPEAKER_03
 I start zoning out sometimes like, I don't mean to, but I'm just kind of going, I don't know what any of these acronyms are.

0:42:58	SPEAKER_03
 And there's a whole set of meetings that are like that.

0:43:00	SPEAKER_03
 That's something.

0:43:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:43:02	SPEAKER_03
 That's really hard.

0:43:03	SPEAKER_03
 And they're writing stuff on boards and stuff that we can't see.

0:43:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:43:06	SPEAKER_03
 And so we don't know what they're referring to.

0:43:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:43:09	SPEAKER_03
 I hear the squeaky pen.

0:43:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:43:11	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, no.

0:43:12	SPEAKER_03
 It's going on that I don't know.

0:43:13	SPEAKER_03
 They're referring to this or that or the other thing and you're just going to know.

0:43:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:43:17	SPEAKER_03
 I don't understand.

0:43:18	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:43:19	SPEAKER_05
 You guys talk about doing a videotape.

0:43:21	SPEAKER_07
 Yes.

0:43:22	SPEAKER_07
 It's mainly a matter of two things.

0:43:25	SPEAKER_07
 First is the storage.

0:43:26	SPEAKER_07
 It'd be so huge that you'd want to be sure that it was of interest to someone that it would be worthwhile doing it.

0:43:30	SPEAKER_07
 And that's the other thing that we don't have someone currently doing the video thing.

0:43:34	SPEAKER_07
 It would really be interesting.

0:43:35	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:43:36	SPEAKER_05
 Because I know it was mentioned.

0:43:37	SPEAKER_05
 Also having a meeting where you all were blindfolds.

0:43:39	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:43:40	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, oh.

0:43:41	SPEAKER_04
 Who's this idea?

0:43:42	SPEAKER_04
 Wasn't it?

0:43:43	SPEAKER_04
 That was this idea.

0:43:44	SPEAKER_04
 What would be the point of that?

0:43:45	SPEAKER_07
 Who else?

0:43:46	SPEAKER_07
 Question of feedback.

0:43:47	SPEAKER_07
 Being able to give feedback.

0:43:48	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, wow.

0:43:49	SPEAKER_00
 I think I've heard a lot of interesting things.

0:43:50	SPEAKER_03
 No, I see.

0:43:51	SPEAKER_03
 So you have to do it vocally as opposed to visually.

0:43:53	SPEAKER_03
 Like you can't use gesture.

0:43:55	SPEAKER_03
 Exactly.

0:43:56	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:43:57	SPEAKER_07
 And that was the meeting where partitions wouldn't work.

0:44:02	SPEAKER_07
 Another possibility is that partitions wouldn't work because then it would cut off the PCMs from having the indirects.

0:44:07	SPEAKER_07
 So it's like, yeah, these unusual configuration problems that you wouldn't normally have.

0:44:12	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:44:13	SPEAKER_07
 Blindfolds.

0:44:14	SPEAKER_07
 And someone else said, well, maybe you could just turn the light out.

0:44:17	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, my God.

0:44:18	SPEAKER_07
 Someone else said no because there are these special lights that have to stay on all the time for the fire coder.

0:44:25	SPEAKER_05
 But then I would just be so worried that someone would cheat.

0:44:29	SPEAKER_05
 You know, it's sort of like a prison dilemma game where everyone's wearing their blindfold because someone could just cheat.

0:44:34	SPEAKER_05
 What's going on?

0:44:35	None
 Are you using your hand?

0:44:36	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:44:37	SPEAKER_05
 There's somebody just being in the limpsino.

0:44:38	SPEAKER_05
 It's a coffee comes back.

0:44:39	SPEAKER_05
 Someone knows.

0:44:40	SPEAKER_05
 It gets bored.

0:44:41	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I mean, there are other things we could expand on with in terms of the methodology.

0:44:52	SPEAKER_07
 It's nice to have a core set of data, though, and they've actually done some, they had some good results in terms of the digits, which they do in terms of having a nice broad set of speakers doing the same thing, meeting after meeting after meeting.

0:45:07	SPEAKER_07
 So that's good.

0:45:09	SPEAKER_07
 I'm wondering.

0:45:10	SPEAKER_07
 So we still technically, you know, I mean, what should we do in terms of T?

0:45:15	SPEAKER_07
 Technically, if we could hang on for 15 more minutes and have T?

0:45:18	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, that's okay.

0:45:19	SPEAKER_00
 And then I'll continue with this next week.

0:45:20	SPEAKER_07
 Sure.

0:45:21	SPEAKER_07
 That'd be great.

0:45:22	SPEAKER_07
 Okay, so, let's see.

0:45:24	SPEAKER_04
 I had something that I could bring up as far as ideas about looking at the data and getting ideas about whatever you said hypotheses about, how to figure it out.

0:45:36	SPEAKER_04
 One thing that I, you probably remember this, that I was really interested in is the use of so and the use of or.

0:45:43	SPEAKER_04
 Because the way people use it in these meetings, I found was, I don't know if it was, if it's different than other people, I don't know if it's a computer speech thing, I mean, computer people's speech thing, but people tend to end utterances quite often with so or and trailing off.

0:45:59	SPEAKER_04
 A couple people in particular.

0:46:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah.

0:46:01	SPEAKER_04
 That's cool.

0:46:02	SPEAKER_04
 And I found that really interesting.

0:46:03	SPEAKER_04
 I was interested to figure out when that happened, if it happened in certain occasions and whatever, and I never really got around to it.

0:46:09	SPEAKER_07
 Do you, people, I mean, does everyone agree with that?

0:46:12	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, I share her intuition that it's sort of unusual to have so use as a final part of a person's turn.

0:46:20	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't sound strange.

0:46:21	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, it doesn't sound like bizarre enough that I don't understand, but I don't think it's something that happens in just everyday speech, really.

0:46:29	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:46:30	SPEAKER_03
 I don't agree necessarily.

0:46:31	SPEAKER_03
 Really?

0:46:32	SPEAKER_03
 I do it.

0:46:33	SPEAKER_03
 I don't agree a lot with so.

0:46:35	SPEAKER_03
 I don't necessarily do it as often as the one speaker I'm thinking of, but I do do that because I think partly because I want to make sure that people know that my thought, my utterance is finished.

0:46:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:46:53	SPEAKER_03
 But that it's not necessarily final, like that you're flexible.

0:46:57	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:46:58	SPEAKER_03
 Or you can build on it or.

0:46:59	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:47:00	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's sort of a like, you guys can take from here.

0:47:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:47:03	SPEAKER_01
 I think somebody build on my thought.

0:47:04	SPEAKER_01
 People also do it with.

0:47:05	SPEAKER_01
 It's kind of like a shag.

0:47:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but it takes to happen.

0:47:08	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, so tends to happen when the person brings up a new idea that kind of goes against with the other people saying, or at least that's what I've been found.

0:47:16	SPEAKER_04
 Like if someone in a meeting is talking about a certain thing and someone kind of interrupts or doesn't necessarily interrupt and says something, either a new topic or a different take on the same topic, we'll tend to use trail off of a couple.

0:47:29	SPEAKER_06
 You can see you might be wrong with it.

0:47:31	SPEAKER_06
 I don't want to actually say that.

0:47:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, kind of.

0:47:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:47:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:47:35	SPEAKER_04
 Interesting.

0:47:36	SPEAKER_04
 And or tends to be used with questions.

0:47:38	SPEAKER_04
 More than.

0:47:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:47:40	SPEAKER_04
 So.

0:47:41	SPEAKER_04
 What's trend?

0:47:42	SPEAKER_03
 I've heard you say so when that sort of sounds like a.

0:47:47	SPEAKER_03
 So in other words, blah, blah, blah, blah.

0:47:50	SPEAKER_07
 Like sort of an end it.

0:47:51	SPEAKER_07
 Of course.

0:47:52	SPEAKER_07
 But that's not really an example of this because I just say so.

0:47:54	SPEAKER_07
 That's the right.

0:47:55	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, so.

0:47:56	SPEAKER_03
 Or maybe I'm misunderstanding about you.

0:47:58	SPEAKER_00
 When you end with so.

0:47:59	SPEAKER_03
 When you end.

0:48:00	SPEAKER_07
 Just ending with that.

0:48:01	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:48:02	SPEAKER_07
 I can get all those extra signatures, but I don't know.

0:48:06	SPEAKER_07
 So.

0:48:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:48:08	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:48:09	SPEAKER_03
 It's like a vocal shrug.

0:48:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:48:11	SPEAKER_07
 That's a very nice characterization.

0:48:13	SPEAKER_07
 Interesting.

0:48:14	SPEAKER_04
 I definitely like to look more at that if I can.

0:48:18	SPEAKER_04
 But that's cool.

0:48:19	SPEAKER_01
 I think people end in butt a lot too.

0:48:21	SPEAKER_01
 And I feel that that means that they want somebody else to take it up or something to sort of like, you know, take it from here.

0:48:27	SPEAKER_01
 So, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah.

0:48:29	SPEAKER_01
 But I'm not really sure.

0:48:31	SPEAKER_04
 Is it a shrug?

0:48:32	SPEAKER_04
 Is it a shrug?

0:48:33	SPEAKER_01
 Is it a shrug?

0:48:34	SPEAKER_01
 It's a different kind of shrug.

0:48:35	SPEAKER_01
 I feel like it sort of asks for somebody else to put input in now.

0:48:40	SPEAKER_04
 I think it shows less of confidence, like less confidence in what they just said.

0:48:43	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:48:44	SPEAKER_03
 Same with, I don't know.

0:48:45	SPEAKER_03
 You can also end in an order.

0:48:46	SPEAKER_03
 It's with blah, blah, blah.

0:48:47	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:48:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:48:49	SPEAKER_03
 Like that.

0:48:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:48:51	SPEAKER_03
 Like I feel like maybe that's similar to butt.

0:48:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:48:56	SPEAKER_03
 More similar than to.

0:48:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:48:58	SPEAKER_07
 I think so too.

0:49:00	SPEAKER_07
 Huh.

0:49:01	SPEAKER_07
 Interesting.

0:49:02	SPEAKER_07
 What about the way people treat when they give a joke?

0:49:04	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, and they're like, they laugh and then after they laugh, they say, ah, I mean, he's so excited.

0:49:10	SPEAKER_07
 Ah, ah.

0:49:11	SPEAKER_07
 Do you, if you find a question?

0:49:14	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:49:15	SPEAKER_07
 And it's like to me, I think I've heard comedians do that.

0:49:18	SPEAKER_07
 There's something there about, you know, you make a joke and then you have an ah in there somehow, which I don't really understand the function of.

0:49:26	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it's like saying like, this is funny, but maybe it shouldn't be funny or this is funny, but maybe it's funny for some sort of perverse reason.

0:49:35	SPEAKER_04
 Or maybe it's just a link to get back to the conversation or something like to connect it with what is going on.

0:49:41	SPEAKER_04
 Well, how is it?

0:49:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:49:43	SPEAKER_03
 So the one I'm thinking of is like, like, haha, you say you would say like, okay, so he's laughing hot and then you go.

0:49:54	SPEAKER_04
 Like kind of laughing with it.

0:49:57	SPEAKER_03
 Kind of like, yeah, kind of like, yeah.

0:50:00	SPEAKER_03
 And to me, that's more of like the, maybe this shouldn't be funny, but it is, maybe this is funny because it's kind of disgusting or perverse.

0:50:08	SPEAKER_03
 So it's possible.

0:50:09	SPEAKER_07
 Now, what I'm thinking, I didn't have the extra, what do you say?

0:50:14	SPEAKER_07
 Nuances in the ah, which you just, which you just did.

0:50:17	SPEAKER_07
 However, the context fits.

0:50:18	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, that's an interesting take on it.

0:50:21	SPEAKER_03
 It's possible.

0:50:24	SPEAKER_07
 So you meant just sort of like a normal ah, but it's stuck in, maybe it's a little louder than usual.

0:50:30	SPEAKER_07
 There's not any of the extra, you know, glottal thing.

0:50:33	SPEAKER_03
 Meaning let's keep going.

0:50:35	SPEAKER_07
 Maybe it means that.

0:50:36	SPEAKER_07
 But it just seems like it's more prominent than it really is like a placeholder of some sort, like, which I think is self reflexive and the sort of brings focus back onto the joke maker.

0:50:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:50:49	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe it's when people don't laugh enough or something.

0:50:52	SPEAKER_00
 It's possible.

0:50:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, like let's come back to the original subject and I will take it from there.

0:50:59	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, it could be.

0:51:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's possible.

0:51:01	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe.

0:51:02	SPEAKER_03
 Because I've heard, um, Morion do that.

0:51:04	SPEAKER_03
 Exactly who I was thinking of actually.

0:51:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:51:06	SPEAKER_07
 He does that.

0:51:07	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, exactly.

0:51:08	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:51:09	SPEAKER_07
 For obvious reasons, probably if that's the way he uses it.

0:51:11	SPEAKER_07
 That's true.

0:51:12	SPEAKER_07
 That would, and he does continue after that.

0:51:14	SPEAKER_07
 But it's just, you know, to say, ah, to say, ah, well, you're laughing, it's just to say, ah, I'm sorry.

0:51:20	SPEAKER_01
 It's a matter of time.

0:51:21	SPEAKER_01
 I think it may almost have to do with like, okay, I told the joke, everyone's laughing, and that's common courtesy.

0:51:25	SPEAKER_01
 I'll sort of tell everyone to stop laughing, you know, if you don't offend me about how good my joke was.

0:51:30	SPEAKER_01
 It's almost like, okay, my joke's over.

0:51:34	SPEAKER_01
 You know, you could stop laughing now.

0:51:36	SPEAKER_04
 That's possible.

0:51:37	SPEAKER_01
 Giving them permission.

0:51:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:51:39	SPEAKER_01
 You know, because it's like, I don't know, I don't know if I should.

0:51:41	SPEAKER_01
 How do you, you know, how much do you laugh after someone's joke to tell them how much you enjoy it later?

0:51:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:51:47	SPEAKER_01
 Or how long do you wait after the joke?

0:51:49	SPEAKER_04
 To keep going with the meeting.

0:51:50	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:51:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:51:52	SPEAKER_04
 Interesting.

0:51:53	SPEAKER_04
 Interesting.

0:51:54	SPEAKER_04
 Because sometimes you can get on digressions, which just lasts for like minutes and times.

0:51:56	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:51:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:51:58	SPEAKER_04
 And people are just hysterical and they're like, what were we talking about?

0:52:00	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:52:01	SPEAKER_04
 It's hard when people get really, really into their laughing and start talking at the same time.

0:52:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:52:10	SPEAKER_04
 It's hard to figure out what they're talking about.

0:52:12	SPEAKER_04
 And also, they don't tend to talk very, there's a lot of dissonances when they're laughing and talking.

0:52:16	SPEAKER_01
 It's hard to.

0:52:17	SPEAKER_01
 Sometimes they make me laugh so hard.

0:52:19	SPEAKER_01
 They'll just be talking about something technical and it'll be so boring.

0:52:23	SPEAKER_01
 Suddenly they'll say something that they only just sort of chuckle at and that I laugh at for the next like 20 minutes.

0:52:29	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's so funny.

0:52:31	SPEAKER_01
 I think what time everybody was doing the digits and they were all doing it at the same time and they started off kind of shaky.

0:52:38	SPEAKER_01
 They were like, oh do we want to do this at the same time?

0:52:40	SPEAKER_01
 You know, that's not all start laughing and then they all did it at the same time.

0:52:44	SPEAKER_01
 One person ended up at the very end doing the digits and everybody had finished and we had like two people to laugh at.

0:52:51	SPEAKER_01
 And they ended so they turned them in and went, you!

0:52:54	SPEAKER_01
 I just kept laughing, laughing, laughing, laughing.

0:53:01	SPEAKER_03
 John will keep making comments about the transcribers.

0:53:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:53:05	SPEAKER_03
 It's the funniest thing.

0:53:06	SPEAKER_03
 He'll say like, mean things about the transcribers.

0:53:10	SPEAKER_04
 He'll be like, I don't mean the transcribers we have here of course.

0:53:14	SPEAKER_03
 Sometimes I'll do that.

0:53:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:53:17	SPEAKER_03
 But sometimes he doesn't and sometimes he'll just be like, you know, he transcribers, transcribers, they're like when they do read the numbers they have no idea.

0:53:28	SPEAKER_07
 He's very funny.

0:53:30	SPEAKER_07
 I started laughing.

0:53:31	SPEAKER_07
 Something he said was the beginning of a meeting and he hadn't gotten far into it and he's doing this one of these mock fights with Nancy which he does.

0:53:38	SPEAKER_07
 He never passed these mock fights and he says something like, yeah.

0:53:45	SPEAKER_07
 They had this nice mutual condescending joking thing going on.

0:53:50	SPEAKER_07
 And he says, I can explain this to you.

0:53:52	SPEAKER_07
 I have a better laugh than you do.

0:53:54	SPEAKER_07
 The transcribers told me so.

0:53:56	SPEAKER_07
 They went a little longer but it's like this.

0:54:01	SPEAKER_07
 At one point she, you know, in another meeting she was not sure which channel she was on and he said, well, I think you're on channel so and so on.

0:54:08	SPEAKER_07
 And she said, well, no, it shouldn't be channel so and so on.

0:54:11	SPEAKER_07
 Well, no, it should be channel so and so and then it turned out it was channel so and so which he said and she said, he said, I bested you again Nancy.

0:54:19	SPEAKER_07
 She said, yes, that's my recollection of all of our meetings together.

0:54:25	SPEAKER_07
 The path is really nice.

0:54:27	SPEAKER_07
 Those sorts of things, it's true.

0:54:29	SPEAKER_07
 It really does live and things happen to have the nice interrelationships.

0:54:34	SPEAKER_07
 I think I found that's a nice aspect of a lot of these meetings.

0:54:38	SPEAKER_07
 The little periods of humor like that.

0:54:42	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:54:43	SPEAKER_07
 All right, well, so do we, we could do digits if we so desired if we wanted to do digits.

0:54:48	SPEAKER_03
 Let's do simultaneous digits.

0:54:50	SPEAKER_03
 And somebody explains why you do digits.

0:54:54	SPEAKER_03
 I still don't really know.

0:54:55	SPEAKER_07
 Okay, the idea is that you have then you have ground truth.

0:54:59	SPEAKER_07
 You know exactly what they're supposed to have said.

0:55:01	SPEAKER_07
 And then of course sometimes we go through and actually people do double check that they read them correctly and all.

0:55:07	SPEAKER_07
 So that we're sure as you've done.

0:55:09	SPEAKER_05
 I remember I did that one too.

0:55:11	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, we are meant to be transcribing if they're just left in the curly brackets.

0:55:16	SPEAKER_07
 No, because it's it should be able to be taken care of efficiently with this interface.

0:55:21	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, if the entire fish people do it then do it.

0:55:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's fine.

0:55:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I've been writing numbers because I wasn't sure what to do.

0:55:28	SPEAKER_07
 Well, if you do that's that's all right as well.

0:55:31	SPEAKER_07
 You don't have to.

0:55:32	SPEAKER_07
 You don't have to.

0:55:33	SPEAKER_07
 Okay, because we're we had the assumption that we'll take care of it this other way.

0:55:37	SPEAKER_07
 But in the case the idea is that you have ground truth.

0:55:39	SPEAKER_07
 You know exactly what the person should have said and you check to be sure.

0:55:42	SPEAKER_07
 And usually there aren't many errors when they were checked.

0:55:45	SPEAKER_07
 And then you have this multiplicity of voices.

0:55:49	SPEAKER_07
 Reading these things and you can do really good speech recognition that way.

0:55:53	SPEAKER_07
 So they have some papers out that they've done this.

0:55:56	SPEAKER_07
 It's been very fruitful in terms of the analyses.

0:55:59	SPEAKER_07
 It's nice to have a standard.

0:56:01	SPEAKER_07
 You know, it's like psychological approach also that you'd like to have some standard stimulus here.

0:56:06	SPEAKER_07
 No, I agree.

0:56:07	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I agree.

0:56:08	SPEAKER_07
 I think it's a nice designed feature.

0:56:10	SPEAKER_03
 Where's the little thing that's supposed to say transcript L dash blah blah.

0:56:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, you're right.

0:56:15	SPEAKER_07
 See, I guess it would be.

0:56:17	SPEAKER_07
 It's up here.

0:56:18	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, I see.

0:56:19	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, okay.

0:56:20	SPEAKER_05
 So I have a question.

0:56:22	SPEAKER_05
 Because now I'm looking at this and I realize I don't know the answer is sometimes when people are reading zero.

0:56:30	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, they say, oh, yes.

0:56:32	SPEAKER_05
 And sometimes they say zero.

0:56:33	SPEAKER_05
 But and I thought that there must be an indication.

0:56:36	SPEAKER_05
 It used to be.

0:56:37	SPEAKER_05
 That's what I thought to be.

0:56:38	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, they changed them.

0:56:39	SPEAKER_07
 Initially it was words all spelled out.

0:56:42	SPEAKER_07
 So oh, oh, oh, my.

0:56:44	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:56:45	SPEAKER_07
 And that was like a stupe test.

0:56:46	SPEAKER_07
 And some ways took a lot of time when I was doing those.

0:56:48	SPEAKER_07
 I had to really concentrate.

0:56:49	SPEAKER_07
 I was like, really had to see the words and the numbers.

0:56:53	SPEAKER_07
 And then you have an OH periodically.

0:56:55	SPEAKER_07
 And they were initially spelled out that way.

0:56:58	SPEAKER_07
 I see.

0:56:59	SPEAKER_04
 So that's why.

0:57:00	SPEAKER_07
 But we converted them to this format.

0:57:02	SPEAKER_07
 And then the idea, I mean, you could conceivably put an OH or a zero for the O's and still have this benefit.

0:57:07	SPEAKER_07
 But I think that the idea is that people can choose what they think is most natural for them to say in those locations.

0:57:13	SPEAKER_07
 And maybe they'd be.

0:57:14	SPEAKER_05
 So it's optional.

0:57:15	SPEAKER_05
 You can say one or the other.

0:57:16	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:57:17	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:57:18	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:57:19	SPEAKER_06
 So, um, can I ask also?

0:57:23	SPEAKER_06
 Sure.

0:57:24	SPEAKER_06
 It says it looks like the grouping is are important.

0:57:26	SPEAKER_06
 But some of the transcripts I've seen they don't have any commas or breaks.

0:57:28	SPEAKER_06
 It's just a string of numbers.

0:57:30	SPEAKER_06
 So we should be adding the breaks if.

0:57:32	SPEAKER_07
 Yes.

0:57:33	SPEAKER_07
 Well, see, also this has been a change in the procedure that used to be that they were like one long string, different size strings.

0:57:39	SPEAKER_07
 But to have them broken up like this, it's been about maybe half a year that this maybe maybe seven months.

0:57:47	SPEAKER_07
 I know.

0:57:48	SPEAKER_07
 Maybe longer.

0:57:49	SPEAKER_07
 That they got and actually broken up within the line.

0:57:52	SPEAKER_07
 So the idea is to pause when you see that.

0:57:55	SPEAKER_04
 But in the transcriptions, I mean, we don't have to deal with that because when you know the other interface deals with that then they break it up.

0:58:01	SPEAKER_07
 That's right.

0:58:02	SPEAKER_07
 Break it up more finely.

0:58:03	SPEAKER_06
 But if you can clearly hear pauses and they've not been transcribed, we should be adding the commas or not.

0:58:08	SPEAKER_07
 The one I'm working on now is like that.

0:58:10	SPEAKER_07
 I would say don't worry about that because, um, this is, again, you know, it'd be nice to get the words right.

0:58:16	SPEAKER_07
 But, um, the interface that these guys used allows you to set the time boundaries really accurately.

0:58:23	SPEAKER_07
 So it's not so important.

0:58:25	SPEAKER_07
 It's more important to focus on the words because there we don't know the ground truth.

0:58:30	SPEAKER_07
 So are we going to do them together?

0:58:33	SPEAKER_07
 Well, I don't know.

0:58:34	SPEAKER_07
 How do you feel?

0:58:35	SPEAKER_07
 I don't care.

0:58:36	SPEAKER_07
 What we could do is we could do it together one week and then separate the next or something like that to give the variety.

0:58:40	SPEAKER_07
 Why don't we do them together this time just because in just a time to get you out of time.

0:58:45	SPEAKER_07
 Okay, so, um, we just start out, we, and you say transcript L, whatever it is, and then launch into the numbers, and then pause between the groups of the gaps.

0:58:53	SPEAKER_07
 And then I guess you're supposed to treat...

0:58:54	SPEAKER_07
 After each line?

0:58:56	SPEAKER_07
 Yes, well, you're supposed to treat each line as kind of like a little sentence.

0:58:59	SPEAKER_07
 What do they say each name?

0:59:00	SPEAKER_07
 For instance, smaller groups.

0:59:02	SPEAKER_07
 Please read each string as if you were given to someone over the telephone.

0:59:04	SPEAKER_07
 He's in the groupings indicated.

0:59:06	SPEAKER_07
 I think the groupings says, so many groupings in telephone numbers, social security number.

0:59:10	SPEAKER_04
 Pause briefly between lines.

0:59:12	SPEAKER_07
 Yes.

0:59:13	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:59:14	SPEAKER_07
 Ready?

0:59:15	SPEAKER_07
 Set?

0:59:16	SPEAKER_07
 Go.

0:59:17	SPEAKER_02

0:59:18	SPEAKER_02
 330.

0:59:19	SPEAKER_02

1:00:11	SPEAKER_01
 But I had one page of numbers left Get it

1:00:17	SPEAKER_05
 I'm just happy I didn't make any mistakes

1:00:26	SPEAKER_07
 I'm distracting it is Did you finish your last I finished my last one really hard though

1:00:33	SPEAKER_01
 I'm in the middle of it. Yeah, I got all the way down and then the very last one. Okay, but I was like I have it left

1:00:47	SPEAKER_07
 Okay, well I want to thank you very much and Look and so we'll meet next week the same time and less than anything I need to check on the schedule, but I think Okay, so unless we have the same time or within an hour. Okay, good. Thanks very much signing off
