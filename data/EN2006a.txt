0:00:00	None
 Okay.

0:00:02	None
 See.

0:00:04	None
 On the mark.

0:00:08	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:00:10	None
 Okay.

0:00:13	None
 You guys actually had sort of interaction, or, or discussions while you were doing the annotation that you have stages of clarification or, I suppose you did, right?

0:00:36	SPEAKER_03
 We did a training set to really compare to three.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_04
 We did two of those.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_03
 We did two training sets and then we had at least one meeting with you where we talked about this.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_00
 So did you feel there was some kind of, some process of convergence, like that initially had quite different ideas about the phrase types and, and, and, and then eventually you came up with some kind of rules that you set up between the two of you or.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. I mean, I thought we had basically the same ideas.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_04
 I don't remember ever having strong arguments about what should be and what group or.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_04
 It was just the rules without thinking.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_04
 And what counted as, as, for the spectral features, it was more of a video.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not sure.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_03
 But I don't remember sort of arguing from the sides and converging just sort of.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_03
 Heasing out what, yeah, come up and agreeing what we do.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_04
 And we had a manual which we haven't got to.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_04
 We can get a copy with that.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_03
 That'd be useful.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_00
 I don't have to leave the meeting now.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_00
 It's been a long time since we've done this and we get Ben to.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_00
 You're working Ben has seen.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_00
 We did so.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_03
 He has had it, certainly.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. He's been in the meanwhile.

0:02:08	None
 We got to the system and get it.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_03
 Now he's gone.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_04
 There's a cool little count now as well.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_04
 Let's know exactly how long you've been leaving.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_01
 Excellent.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_03
 Oh.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_05
 We should have these things in our area.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_05
 No, we don't have height.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_05
 There's no height.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_02
 We don't have height.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it's actually telescopes.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_02
 That's different than those things.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_03
 They're hardly in our areas.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_03
 They have good enough.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_03
 Confidence thing, haven't they?

0:02:38	SPEAKER_03
 In the ATC?

0:02:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah. That's right.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_05
 Although it isn't actually used all that often these days.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_03
 I had to fly to Germany to the teleconference.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_03
 In Germany.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_03
 I'm so much easier for the ESO interview.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_03
 Gosh.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_03
 And they fly to Germany and put you on a four-way teleconference with me people in Chile.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_03
 And had they asked, we could have done it to find that ATC.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_02
 And see, we're going to get to Germany today.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_03
 But it's enough.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_03
 I haven't got that far.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_04
 It's a very strange interview feeling as well because you can't see them.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_04
 Any miss in the body language.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_04
 Well, you're giving your talk because they just show, usually they have a camera on you and a camera on them.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_04
 But during the talk part, they have a camera on, I believe them.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_04
 Because I could see that guy reading a newspaper halfway through my talk.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_04
 And then they had a camera on showing what my slides were.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_04
 And I think it's a bit of a quick story.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_04
 If you know that, you can talk about it.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_03
 So I was thinking that I'd be interested in this.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_03
 And I thought, okay, that's the only way to get that they can see you at all.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_03
 So, when all of that was over, they were answering your questions and the view switched again.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_03
 And I realized I was sitting there on the interview going.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_03
 And mine was even, it was different again.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_04
 It was a four-way split screen with me and three other people.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_04
 And it just stayed like that.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_04
 And I had the talk on the laptop in front of me.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_03
 It's not easy towards the top left of the image.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_03
 And luckily, I love you, it warned me, it might be complicated.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_03
 And so I had something with, without very many, not how I was flying in and the things, because that was just really difficult.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_03
 But I practice the talking, standing up in front of it and pointing to things.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_03
 And you're sitting down in front of it.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_03
 And you can see yourself, but not only do you see yourself bounce back two seconds later.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_02
 But I tell you, it's a little bit gone to Chile at back.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_03
 So you're like, well, can I just do that? And then you're reacting to what you did a while ago.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_03
 That's a really daft situation.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_03
 Great.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_04
 Alright, we can start talking about, shall we dive in in the intro?

0:04:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, yes.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_03
 Continue on flux, we'll continue.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_03
 Flux on its own wouldn't be a spectral feature.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_03
 I think it should probably just be continuing.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_03
 It was continuing luminosity, probably wouldn't.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_03
 No, you wouldn't.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_03
 I think I'm working out who's tapping bottom.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I'm happy enough with that.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_00
 I actually haven't really thought about like marking on both marking who's tapping who's bottom.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_00
 I think maybe that would make sense for you guys to know.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_04
 I think we've got to.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_04
 I think we've got to.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_04
 He left it out on purpose, which is recent.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_04
 I'm pretty sure I'm top.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_04
 So, people are watching top.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_03
 Because I would fight for lying being a spectral feature as well.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think that's probably right as well.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_03
 It's hard to mark on this.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_03
 Let's do that.

0:05:49	None
 Okay, next.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_00
 So, sorry, I'm just for the convention.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_00
 You're marking which annotation you think is the right one.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_03
 And if neither, then we'll have to put something else.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_04
 So, here I'm missing a soft component on the body.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_03
 I think that you're probably right.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_03
 Soft component is a feature.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_04
 If you get lying, I get soft component.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_03
 Do you think?

0:06:16	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_03
 I shouldn't intervene, probably.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_05
 Well, isn't it that if it's a region of the spectral that you can point at it, then it is a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a feature.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_05
 And that isn't.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_03
 You can point to a soft component.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_05
 You think?

0:06:38	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_04
 It's a big bump in the soft bit.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:06:44	None
 Okay.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_03
 There is a feature, part of a spectral feature.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_03
 I think you'll look there as well.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not asked about that.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_03
 It's not just absorption.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_03
 But it's not just absorption.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_03
 It's actually something in absorption that you're seeing.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_03
 If it was a, a different absorption for a lack of absorption, you would put it in.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_04
 This is, this is, we said, we would put describing those.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_04
 That's a thing you point to, and this is a physical mechanism.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_04
 So yeah, I'd say two down.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to do it.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_04
 Excellent.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_03
 That's two.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_04
 That's definitely two.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_04
 You're right.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_03
 Ah, this one with the equivalent width.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_03
 I think you're right there.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_03
 We weren't going to mark the equivalent width, but we weren't going to mark the lines.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's true.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_04
 That's true.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_04
 You get that.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_03
 And nebulin.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_03
 There's a source type.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_04
 I don't remember what we were doing with nebulin.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_04
 We weren't doing like H2 regions and stuff.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_03
 I can't remember.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_03
 Should we see when many will come, so it's come back to that one?

0:08:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_04
 I thought I'm probably doing that either.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_04
 We're doing descriptions that made things separate classes.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_04
 In which case I'd argue for a look to go to things.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_04
 I'm just gone mad with the other line in here.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_03
 Breaking the power law index.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's probably a...

0:08:56	SPEAKER_03
 You can point to it.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_03
 I think that you wouldn't know it was a...

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 It's something you've derived.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_04
 The power law index is something you've derived.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_04
 A break in a spectrum is something you can point at.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_03
 So what's up to making a power law index?

0:09:12	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_05
 That's a feature.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_05
 Because in this perspective it does that and it does that.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_05
 That thing there.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_05
 That is where it breaks.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_03
 It's light to depression if you continue near the line limit.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_03
 I think you were right.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_04
 And if I did it again, I'd say slight depression at the continuum, and possibly...

0:09:30	SPEAKER_04
 Well, you could say both the slight depression and the line limit, but we're supposed to say the descriptive words of the features.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. If it was absorption at H alpha, that would all be one.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_03
 Or absorption at 5000 nanometers would all be one anyway.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_03
 But they would be the same at a certain point.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_04
 They'd both be the same spectral feature.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_04
 Whereas here there's two near.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_04
 Well, this is near.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_04
 There's a line limit which you can see, and then there's a slight depression near it.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_03
 I think you're right.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_03
 It's near rather than at.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_03
 It's not near.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_03
 Did you?

0:10:01	SPEAKER_03
 It's not that.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_03
 Do you have a sense about that?

0:10:04	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, you want to split that one into two?

0:10:07	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_05
 I'd agree with that, I think.

0:10:10	None
 Is that clear?

0:10:11	None
 Excellent.

0:10:12	None
 It's good.

0:10:13	None
 Yeah.

0:10:14	None
 Okay.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_03
 Absorption.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_03
 That I didn't mark because...

0:10:19	None
 Yeah.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:10:22	None
 Okay.

0:10:23	None
 Absorption.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_03
 That I didn't mark because...

0:10:33	SPEAKER_04
 It's the physical process of absorption.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_04
 Not the...

0:10:39	SPEAKER_03
 Anyway, as well.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_04
 The thing.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_03
 I think it was more of an awakeness.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_00
 Would there be other cases where you would actually mark absorption?

0:10:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_04
 If it was...

0:10:51	SPEAKER_04
 There's an absorption feature or absorption.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_04
 You see it in the spectrum at this wavelength.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_04
 But when you say, for example, the quasar is absorbed.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_04
 That just means the quasar is behind a bunch of stuff.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_04
 Cheers.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_04
 Thanks.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_04
 So that's describing something physically rather than describing the spectrum itself.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_00
 Mm-hmm.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_03
 There is no steep self-compassionate but a 2K.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_04
 I don't remember what we were going to do about things that weren't there.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_04
 It's not something that's important to...

0:11:32	SPEAKER_04
 You could point to it if it were there.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, you could.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_03
 I tend to miss out on things if they're too long.

0:11:40	None
 Mm-hmm.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:11:43	None
 Okay.

0:11:44	None
 But if it had been there, you would have...

0:11:49	None
 You would have marked...

0:11:50	None
 Yeah.

0:11:51	None
...had it as a feature.

0:11:52	None
 Yeah.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_05
 If you go back to number five.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_03
 Is that the nebula?

0:12:06	SPEAKER_04
 Was it the nebula?

0:12:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_04
 We're saying about labia?

0:12:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:12:23	None
 Yeah.

0:12:24	None
 Yeah.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_04
 The nebula counts, doesn't it?

0:12:30	SPEAKER_03
 I think it does.

0:12:32	None
 Right.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_03
 You weren't matching H2 regions because it was a region.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_03
 I think it was the...

0:12:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_03
 I think it was the start for that.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_03
 Line again.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_03
 Line with that line ratios.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if we were going to mark line ratios, but we were going to mark equilibrium here, where you've got equipment of HP, too.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_03
 Or if it's...

0:12:59	SPEAKER_04
 But...

0:13:00	SPEAKER_04
...ratios different.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_04
 Line and...

0:13:02	SPEAKER_04
 In line and line ratios is modifying ratios.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_04
 ratios that is not talking about specific lines, a line ratios a thing.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, because I would actually list it explicitly on that you're not going to include.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_03
 Don't include?

0:13:20	SPEAKER_05
 Line ratios after abundances.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_05
 Is that the value or the word?

0:13:26	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, I see what you mean.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_04
 You wouldn't include a property.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_04
 You wouldn't include abundances or line strengths.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_03
 You wouldn't include line in that.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, oh, I see what you're doing.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_04
 You're circling the one you like.

0:13:46	None
 The one you like.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_03
 Don't climb an alpha.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_03
 Absorbers.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's a spectral feature even though it's...

0:13:55	SPEAKER_03
 You wouldn't mark the source type.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, sorry.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_00
 So can you just ask?

0:14:02	SPEAKER_00
 Now you just aligned.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_00
 You circled the word in the other line, which didn't...

0:14:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, because we don't want to underline.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_00
 I see.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_04
 So again, these are source types.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, it's not a source type, but it's also a...

0:14:23	SPEAKER_04
 But down-plan and alpha absorbers are physical things, not spectral features.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_03
 But you also absorb them by...

0:14:30	SPEAKER_03
 You're observed from by their spectral feature.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_03
 What are we doing for things...

0:14:34	SPEAKER_03
 The board absorption line, Crazor, for example.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_03
 We were marking the board absorption line as well as board absorption line, Crazor.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_03
 So I think it should be the same as that.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_03
 If it's defined by a spectral feature, we should mark it.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_04
 But...

0:14:49	SPEAKER_04
 You wouldn't be able to point to something in a spectrum and say that's a damp line in alpha absorber unless you...

0:14:56	SPEAKER_03
 You could point to damp line in alpha though.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_03
 Because it says...

0:15:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, spectral features within are referring to a type of source, e.g.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_03
 Balen, Palquasar.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_04
 But we wouldn't say absorbers were a type of source.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_03
 Um, not a specific type of source, but I think still the spectral feature counts even though it's a modifier or something.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not certain about that, but I...

0:15:21	SPEAKER_03
 What do you reckon about me?

0:15:23	SPEAKER_05
 Um...

0:15:26	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I mean, you look at this spectrum in spots that...

0:15:32	SPEAKER_05
 The line of alpha has been damped.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_04
 But...

0:15:36	SPEAKER_05
 That is a spectral feature.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_04
 Don't... with damp line in alpha absorbers, you see them in a variety of places along the line of sight.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_04
 So you have to know...

0:15:47	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, yeah, no, that's true.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_03
 How does it work?

0:15:49	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what...

0:15:50	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not planning on asking for this.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_04
 If you look at Aquasar and you see a bunch of...

0:15:53	SPEAKER_04
 If you go to a bunch of clouds of gas in the way, you can see these things.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_04
 Um...

0:15:58	SPEAKER_04
 But you wouldn't be able to point at one of them and say, Ah, that's that.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_03
 They're gonna be different redshifts.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_03
 But that doesn't mean that it's...

0:16:05	SPEAKER_03
 You can still say, that's damp line in alpha, and that's damp line in alpha.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know how they do that.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but they say all of that is damp line in alpha.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_05
 But you're guessing in a way, though, aren't you?

0:16:14	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:16:16	SPEAKER_03
 But isn't that always against something that's not particularly...

0:16:18	SPEAKER_04
 Wouldn't they, but you see them in all sorts of different redshifts.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_04
 It's like the, the line in alpha forest, sort of.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_04
 And I'm not certain I would...

0:16:29	SPEAKER_04
 I would mark that.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_05
 Hmm, that's a...

0:16:34	SPEAKER_05
 That's pretty one.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_03
 That's certainly...

0:16:36	SPEAKER_03
 If it was...

0:16:37	SPEAKER_03
 If it was some other spectral feature, then absorb it.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_03
 It would be my...

0:16:43	SPEAKER_04
 No, I wouldn't, because it's...

0:16:48	SPEAKER_04
 Their physical thing is not spectral features.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_04
 You can't point at something on a spectrum and say, that's definitely a damp line in alpha.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_04
 And I guess it's because they're modifiers of this source type, and we wouldn't mark that source type.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_04
 But we include modifiers of source type.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_03
 We wouldn't mark that source type.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_03
 We wouldn't mark that source type.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_03
 But if it was a damp line in alpha quasar, then we would mark quasar, and we would mark damp line in alpha.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_03
 Right, well...

0:17:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it would be like a Yeah, it would be like a It would mark it.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_03
 In the manual.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_03
 So it's just, I guess, where the damp line in alpha is a spectral feature in itself.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_03
 Which I would put against tricky one.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_03
 Say it was, but then I've never looked at it.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_05
 I guess it is.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_05
 And then it is altering the spectrum, isn't it?

0:17:34	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, it's changing this spectrum of background objects.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't have to be something that's specific.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_03
 I guess we say a big blue bomb or a soft or a continuum, and we include those.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_04
 But we weren't going to include descriptions of spectral features that were based on fitting.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_03
 That's true.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_03
 We have included power law, though.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_03
 Have we?

0:17:59	SPEAKER_03
 No, we included steep soft components, sorry.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_03
 And here we included breaking the power law.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_03
 Because of the break.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_04
 Steep soft component.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, breaking the power law is something I'm not certain of.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_04
 Steep soft component is something you can point at in a spectrum at same.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_03
 There it is.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_03
 There's still some to be a fitting in the notes.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:18	None
 Yeah.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_03
 You know what's steep and what's shallow?

0:18:22	SPEAKER_03
 It's tricky.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_03
 Let's have that for now.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_03
 If we change our mind later when we go through, we can always come back to it and say.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_04
 Again, I'd say this is a physical process.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:18:39	None
 I'm sorry.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_03
 And absorption again.

0:18:45	None
 Yeah.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_04
 I don't have K-star, but I should do.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_03
 And this one here.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_03
 We were including feature within spectral feature.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_01
 What's wrong with Broadway, Jalfa?

0:19:19	SPEAKER_03
 I think I just missed it.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_03
 It's not as if it's a...

0:19:24	SPEAKER_03
 Although it's called itself maximum, it's still the line within it.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:33	None
 Yeah.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_03
 It's a little bit more easy.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_03
 Silicon II is an element rather than the...

0:19:43	SPEAKER_03
 In this context.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_03
 Rather than the line.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_03
 These are the lines.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_03
 I guess what you...

0:19:52	SPEAKER_03
 If Maya there wasn't in there, then you'd have it Silicon II lines at...

0:19:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_03
 And you're Silicon II derived from these two features.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's here too.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_05
 That's actually an ionic species.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_05
 That's actually an answer.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_05
 A spectral feature.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_04
 I don't say.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_03
 That's true.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_03
 And I'm in alpha-porus clouds.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_03
 Oh no!

0:20:19	SPEAKER_03
 We're back to it again.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_03
 I'm in alpha-porus.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_03
 You can point to one spectrum.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_04
 That's true.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_04
 But line in alpha-porus clouds are source types we aren't marking.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_04
 So we haven't...

0:20:31	SPEAKER_03
 We just haven't got a rule for spectral features within a thing, just types of source.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_03
 We don't know about the marking source.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_03
 But we're just speaking system.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_03
 We're marking H2 and H2 regions, for example.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_04
 And I don't think we are.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_04
 Because that's not a spectral feature.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but I guess it's not defined by a spectral feature.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_03
 And then we have a question where is...

0:20:54	SPEAKER_03
...lamin alpha-porus is defined by...

0:20:57	SPEAKER_03
 The definition of lamin alpha-porus clouds is that we have lamin alpha-porus.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_04
 But saying that isn't the same as saying we've seen that in the spectrum.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_04
 Whereas a broad line, quasar, someone has looked at it and they've seen a broad line.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_04
 But if you're discussing lamin alpha-porus clouds, they could just be discussing the physical object, which we aren't marking.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_05
 Why aren't you marking it then?

0:21:21	SPEAKER_04
 Because they weren't...

0:21:23	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think we were mapping the blobs.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_03
 Anything to keep.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't diffuse emission.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_03
 Uh-huh.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_00
 It wouldn't count as a source type.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_05
 Well, that's what I'm...

0:21:36	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_05
...wondering, really.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_04
 I remembered not marking nebula or clouds.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but this is...

0:21:46	SPEAKER_05
...dispond's species cloud.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_05
 It's a...

0:21:51	SPEAKER_05
...and particular species of cloud, not just a general cloud, isn't it?

0:21:57	SPEAKER_05
 So...

0:21:58	SPEAKER_05
 Isn't that different?

0:22:02	SPEAKER_03
 It's a modifier of clouds, but I don't think we're including the...

0:22:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_01
 I think we're not including...

0:22:12	SPEAKER_03
...we can't include...

0:22:13	SPEAKER_04
...if above saying maybe we should be including nebula in clouds.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_03
 Perhaps we should have done...

0:22:18	SPEAKER_03
...but we haven't done the whole thing.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_03
 So I think maybe we just need to put...

0:22:22	SPEAKER_03
 I guess not.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_03
...and we don't include...

0:22:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_01
...diffuse emission.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_03
 But then we still have to decide if we don't enable the source, what do we do about the spectral features that define that source?

0:22:38	SPEAKER_03
 If we have, for example, board absorption line object, we mark that.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_03
 We mark board absorption line in that.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_04
 That's because we've...

0:22:45	SPEAKER_04
 I know it's a rather blub absorption line object, we have seen it.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_03
 But to know this is a liminal for post cloud, we've seen liminal for post.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_05
 But it's in the spectrum of another object, though.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_05
 It isn't the spectrum of the...

0:23:02	SPEAKER_03
 But it's still a spectral feature, and if it's not...

0:23:05	SPEAKER_03
...it might be a spectral feature, not in the cloud, but it's a spectral feature in the quasar.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_03
 That is true.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_05
 That is true.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_05
 And it could point at it, that's true, and say, that is...

0:23:14	SPEAKER_03
 Let's keep up.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_03
 Not that.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_03
 It's not supposed to be better.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so...

0:23:27	SPEAKER_03
...liminal for post again.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_03
 And that definitely is a spectral feature on its own, though.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_03
 Because it doesn't fit in the post cloud.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_03
 Each helium-2 optical depth, I think that's an element.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's derived.

0:23:44	None
 All right.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_03
 Oh.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, we might have the same lines.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_04
 Excellent.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_04
 What have we done differently?

0:23:54	SPEAKER_04
 You've got line brightness temperatures.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_03
 It's a do-eye property for line.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_03
 We're gonna have a lot of these.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we are.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_03
 And we weren't using line...

0:24:06	SPEAKER_03
 What's one we didn't do before?

0:24:08	SPEAKER_03
 Line ratio we weren't doing.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think line brightness temperatures counts.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_04
 Because it's not talking about a specific line.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_02
 So, but...

0:24:18	SPEAKER_04
...limbs.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think that counts.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_03
 Line feature?

0:24:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_00
 Um, I'm sorry, can we just go back to one page?

0:24:32	SPEAKER_00
 Did you resolve the different segmentations?

0:24:35	SPEAKER_00
 Like, the main problem was...

0:24:38	SPEAKER_03
 There's only one difference here.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, sorry.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_00
 I thought it was a problem of like, one having underlined the entire...

0:24:44	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, sorry.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_00
 No, no.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. Sorry, guys.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_03
 Quite implicitly.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_03
 That's it.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_03
 That one's a spin.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_04
 Damp line and alpha again.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_04
 Systems.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_02
 And...

0:25:01	SPEAKER_03
 And then...

0:25:02	SPEAKER_03
...liminal the data.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_04
 That's a modifier of data.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_03
 I can't believe it.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_03
 But if you said...

0:25:10	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, that's...

0:25:12	SPEAKER_04
 If you said the spectral data...

0:25:14	SPEAKER_03
...type of data.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_03
 The continuum spectrum.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_04
 I really don't think that counts.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_03
 But if you said damp line and alpha spectrum, you'd mark damp line and alpha.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_03
 Because it's in the spectrum and a data...

0:25:25	SPEAKER_03
...because it was a equivalent spectrum.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_04
 I think...

0:25:29	SPEAKER_04
...just because it's got a spectral feature in the phrase...

0:25:32	SPEAKER_04
...you wouldn't, for example, when we were saying silicon two levels, we didn't mark silicon two.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_04
 That's because it was a spectrum.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_03
 I can't believe it's saying silicon two line.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_04
 But what this actually means is we've made some measurements...

0:25:46	SPEAKER_04
...based on damp line and alpha measurements...

0:25:50	SPEAKER_04
...and they tell us this answer.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_04
 And this answer is...

0:25:53	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's probably right in the case of it being data.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I don't think that's right.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_05
 I'm not sure, actually.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_05
 I think I would mark it.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_05
 It is a region of the spectrum and they are actually using a region of the spectrum...

0:26:13	SPEAKER_05
...as the data.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_03
 If it's an emission line, there's...

0:26:19	SPEAKER_05
 But if you both want not to mark it, then find it.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_05
 Don't mark it.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_03
 If it's an emission line data, we put it in.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_04
 I wouldn't.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_04
 But if it's just said emission line, we would.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_03
 The emission line is strong.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_03
 The emission line data shows strong.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_01
 Then I think it's the same, actually.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's...

0:26:40	SPEAKER_03
...data isn't even needed.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_03
 It's inconsistent with the damp line and alpha at more than...

0:26:47	SPEAKER_03
...and I've never seen it.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_03
 Or we're damped enough for feature.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_03
 You put feature there rather than data within your market.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, feature, absolutely.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_03
 But I think data is equivalent.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_03
 I think that it's equivalent.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_00
 From the perspective of the name the entity recognition task, there was also this one guideline of saying, for example, if something is sitting under a negation, there was no damped L, Y, L for something.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_00
 Then I think the convention was that you still would mark that.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_00
 It's more like a quite literal task.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_00
 It's really finding these types of strings rather than really referring to the underlying...

0:27:25	SPEAKER_00
...physical reality.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_00
 If you were to resolve these kind of cases in order to put them in a database...

0:27:31	SPEAKER_00
...so then you'd probably be right in this case.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_00
 But given that the kind of thing is that there's named anti-directing...

0:27:38	SPEAKER_00
...t

0:27:50	SPEAKER_03
...it should be......damped L, Y, L for...

0:28:02	SPEAKER_03
...in red, whatever that is, spec or feature.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_03
 And that should be there at all.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_03
 It's got a good hand back then it twice.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_03
 Is that clear enough?

0:28:26	SPEAKER_04
 A sort of type...

0:28:29	SPEAKER_04
...if we have a rule about this.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_03
 We were including modifiers, including borderline craze-lars, non-boardline craze-lars as well.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we should probably...

0:28:42	SPEAKER_03
...the flat spec from the video quiz is very different.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_03
 That's true. It keeps spec from...

0:28:53	SPEAKER_04
...10% of the way there.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_04
 No, I think we can have something.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_04
 Just hitting the half an hour mark.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_04
 Continuous.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_05
 Speed up.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_03
 It'll be a bit better.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_03
 Monthly software, nice and continuous.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_03
 You like that, I think?

0:29:09	SPEAKER_04
 See, that's talking about the flux of ionizing photons rather than the absorbent continuum of that spectrum.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, I don't like that one.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_03
 Oxygen, sugar, and that's not a good tip.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_03
 Here's the element absorption modes.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_03
 I think you should be there.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_04
 I'm happy enough with that.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_03
 What else is different?

0:29:43	SPEAKER_04
 Blue shifted.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_04
 That's okay with being okay.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I can have that as well.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_04
 There we go.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_04
 Let's...

0:29:57	SPEAKER_03
 You write stuff on the galaxy, so...

0:30:01	SPEAKER_03
...distinct.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know why I did that one.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I don't like that at all.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_03
 Probably because you were doing 7,000 degrees.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I couldn't even get that.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_04
 Lines from ions?

0:30:22	SPEAKER_04
 You can't tell the difference between a line from an ion or something else.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_04
 Not...

0:30:27	SPEAKER_04
 Well, you know where they are in the...

0:30:30	SPEAKER_04
 I guess...

0:30:31	SPEAKER_03
 If it was lines from an H2...

0:30:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's true.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_04
 That's true.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_01
 Alright.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_03
 Blue wing flux.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_03
 What are we going to do about flux?

0:30:43	SPEAKER_01
 Does it say?

0:30:57	SPEAKER_04
 The feature itself is blue wing flux, or if it was a blue wing feature, with marked feature.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, it's the amount of stuff in the blue wing.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_03
 Line peak.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_03
 I think that should be marked, even though it's to a increasing line peak.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_03
 It's also to a increasing excess blue wing.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_03
 Mmm.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_03
 Do you actually need excess blue wing flux?

0:31:32	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_03
 I think line peak is a piece of...

0:31:43	SPEAKER_04
 Do you can point?

0:31:45	SPEAKER_04
 Sure, but can you point to a line peak velocity shift?

0:31:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I don't think you can.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_03
 You can't also point to increasing blue wing.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_04
 We can point to blue wing flux because you have your line and there's the blue wing flux.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_04
 But if a line peak is increasingly shifted...

0:32:01	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I don't think that's the feature.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_04
 There's a system issue again, so we should be consistent.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you, but...

0:32:14	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:32:23	None
 Thank you.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_03
 Nuclear hydrogen, you've got an petite.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_03
 I think all of us suspect that feature.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_03
 It's basically a way of saying the gunpeters...

0:32:40	SPEAKER_03
 It's a way of saying the gunpeters in 12th, though.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_03
 Which, if you just said that...

0:32:46	SPEAKER_03
 Well...

0:32:47	SPEAKER_03
 It's gunpeters in absorption.

0:32:49	SPEAKER_02
 It's not a process.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_03
 Rather than...

0:32:51	SPEAKER_03
 If it was hydrogen absorption, it marked the whole thing.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_03
 There's hydrogen in the line you would, so you should mark it as...

0:32:58	SPEAKER_03
 Or H-B2 absorption.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_03
 It's a...

0:33:01	SPEAKER_03
 Marks that kind of expect the feature, doesn't it?

0:33:04	SPEAKER_05
 It's a process, isn't it?

0:33:06	SPEAKER_03
 But since H-B2 absorption is a process from H-B2, but it's still...

0:33:11	SPEAKER_03
 This is a process from nuclear hydrogen.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_03
 I guess what I mean is nuclear hydrogen should be in there.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_03
 And the fact that gunpeters in comes between it...

0:33:20	SPEAKER_03
 It's just a pain.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_05
 Well...

0:33:25	SPEAKER_05
 I wouldn't have any of it, I think.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_05
 I think all of that is just that it's a script of a process.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_05
 Isn't it?

0:33:33	SPEAKER_04
 I think I might agree with H-B2.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_04
 Because this definitely shouldn't be marked.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_04
 Because that is a process now.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_04
 And if that shouldn't be marked, then that shouldn't be marked.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_03
 Let's just cross off the mat.

0:33:58	None
 What?

0:33:59	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, blueshifts of absorption.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_03
 And you get a modify of the thing I'm saying I probably should be there.

0:34:14	None
 Okay.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_01
 As an we think we can...

0:34:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_03
...song absorption we can.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_03
 I think we should ditch it.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_03
 Um...

0:34:24	SPEAKER_03
 Let's talk about the lion, isn't it?

0:34:31	SPEAKER_03
 So that should be it.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_05
 Do you think?

0:34:39	None
 Yeah.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, let's talk about that.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_03
 And to strength, yeah.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_03
 It's not the abundance of it or any derive property.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_03
 It's just the strength of the lion's.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_05
 You don't think that it actually is abundance really in a way?

0:35:03	SPEAKER_05
 I'm not sure, but...

0:35:04	SPEAKER_03
 I guess perhaps it is.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_05
 I'm not sure.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I'm not sure.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_03
 Um...

0:35:10	SPEAKER_03
 Let's make it a decision.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_03
 Um...

0:35:18	SPEAKER_03
 I guess it could be a bit of a note.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_04
 Well, yes.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_04
 Either that...

0:35:22	SPEAKER_04
...if that shouldn't be and neither should either of those.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, it's true.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_03
 I think it probably should then.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_03
 Because we will put narrow line strength.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_03
 If it's a different...

0:35:32	SPEAKER_03
...I'd be too lying strength.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_03
 We'll definitely put it here.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, that's right.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_03
 And I think that's what it's referring to even though it's not...

0:35:41	SPEAKER_03
...is not saying...

0:35:43	SPEAKER_05
 Well, but it...

0:35:45	SPEAKER_05
...isn't it's an elemental abundance that you estimate actually using a number of lines.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_05
 It isn't just one discrete line in the spectrum, is it?

0:35:58	SPEAKER_03
 If it's a line...

0:36:00	SPEAKER_03
...worth you to...

0:36:02	SPEAKER_03
 It's an abundance.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_03
 It's an element, I guess.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_03
 But it's...

0:36:07	SPEAKER_05
...who is an ionic species and it'll have a number of...

0:36:09	SPEAKER_05
...lines in the spectrum when you're...

0:36:13	SPEAKER_05
...estimating.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_05
 And the abundance of the...

0:36:19	SPEAKER_05
...spishy that she's using all the lines.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_03
 Uh...

0:36:23	SPEAKER_03
...but it says strength rather than abundance.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's still looking at the amount of flux coming out of all the F and Q lines rather than...

0:36:30	SPEAKER_04
...with marked things.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_04
 Um...

0:36:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I don't know if we've marked things like...

0:36:37	SPEAKER_04
...so it can't be one throughout.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_03
 In general, we haven't...

0:36:42	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, it's specifically saying it's a line.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_03
 But I guess the question is, does this specifically refer to a line?

0:36:48	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it's not clear enough to...

0:36:50	SPEAKER_01
...well...

0:36:51	SPEAKER_03
...that's not marked.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, if we don't mark it though, we definitely shouldn't mark these two.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_03
 Well, if that's line, now a line.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_03
 If it says it's F.E.2 line strength, then we would mark it.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_03
 Can you talk about the line a bit rather than the element?

0:37:03	SPEAKER_03
 Do you agree with that?

0:37:05	SPEAKER_05
 I think so.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_04
 If that's true, then they're leaving out the word line.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think it should mean that it shouldn't be marked.

0:37:11	SPEAKER_03
 The word line should be in there.

0:37:12	SPEAKER_03
 Or...

0:37:13	SPEAKER_04
 We know what they mean.

0:37:15	SPEAKER_03
 Right?

0:37:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_03
 I think they mean...

0:37:18	SPEAKER_03
...I think they mean the line strength rather than the F.E.2 abundance.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_03
 Well, then have it in.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_03
 That's what the full period...

0:37:26	SPEAKER_03
...next.

0:37:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_03
 Blotestar.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_03
 That's it.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_04
 Is that what that means?

0:37:34	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:37:36	SPEAKER_01
 Um...

0:37:37	SPEAKER_03
...take out my...

0:37:39	SPEAKER_03
...and that's just the one.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_03
 Oh.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_03
 That's just the one colour.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_03
 This is...

0:37:49	SPEAKER_03
...that...

0:37:50	SPEAKER_03
...your light.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_04
 I think you're right there.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_04
 That counts.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yep.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:38:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_03
 Any other lens one?

0:38:17	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_04
 Back up.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_03
 That was when I wasn't sure about it because I didn't do phone for it.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_03
 Midden for...

0:38:32	SPEAKER_03
...if it was...

0:38:33	None
...you lurks, you put it in.

0:38:36	SPEAKER_03
 That's...

0:38:38	SPEAKER_03
...just the one that...

0:38:39	SPEAKER_03
...this...

0:38:40	SPEAKER_03
...is just...

0:38:41	SPEAKER_03
...this should be a source name.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_04
...shouldn't be...

0:38:43	SPEAKER_04
...should.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know...

0:38:47	SPEAKER_04
...does those count as modifiers active?

0:38:49	SPEAKER_04
 We definitely include active.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:38:52	SPEAKER_03
 I guess the problem is G2.

0:38:54	SPEAKER_03
 What does that mean?

0:38:55	SPEAKER_04
 I've assumed it kind of elliptical.

0:38:58	SPEAKER_04
 E2 is hyper elliptical.

0:38:59	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:39:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:01	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what the gene means.

0:39:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:39:03	SPEAKER_03
 Is this one I just think I would...

0:39:06	SPEAKER_03
...if it was a cataloo.

0:39:08	SPEAKER_01
 Mmm.

0:39:09	SPEAKER_03
 Mmm.

0:39:10	SPEAKER_03
 I think Shippen...

0:39:14	SPEAKER_03
...those can...

0:39:16	SPEAKER_04
...does that not mean a...

0:39:18	SPEAKER_04
...a broadband detection?

0:39:20	SPEAKER_04
 And does that count?

0:39:22	SPEAKER_05
 Sorry.

0:39:23	SPEAKER_05
 Mostly.

0:39:24	SPEAKER_04
 A...H alpha detection.

0:39:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you're still detecting the line.

0:39:28	SPEAKER_03
 You think you're detecting it from broadband?

0:39:30	SPEAKER_03
 I thought it's...

0:39:32	SPEAKER_04
...but don't we say we don't do that?

0:39:36	SPEAKER_04
 Um...

0:39:40	SPEAKER_04
...I would write, look.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_04
 Don't include modifiers of regions or systems.

0:39:44	SPEAKER_04
 E.G.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_04
...ward line region.

0:39:46	SPEAKER_04
 You are right, systems.

0:39:48	SPEAKER_04
 That's why I wasn't doing it.

0:39:49	SPEAKER_03
 And now a line, nebuling.

0:39:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, we just get back to change this.

0:39:52	SPEAKER_03
 You're right.

0:39:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:39:55	SPEAKER_03
 Where were it started here?

0:39:56	SPEAKER_03
 Um...

0:40:00	SPEAKER_03
 Why did it...

0:40:02	SPEAKER_03
...to do that?

0:40:05	SPEAKER_03
 We have got an heavily marked here.

0:40:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but modifiers of regions or systems is the...

0:40:13	SPEAKER_03
...to be an if you see one.

0:40:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we could always change this if we think we're right, rather than going back through it.

0:40:19	SPEAKER_03
 So, damp, lime and alpha absorbers shouldn't be in there.

0:40:23	SPEAKER_04
 Based on this, but we could change this rule rather than changing all those things.

0:40:27	SPEAKER_03
 But then...

0:40:28	SPEAKER_03
 I may... I probably use that rule half the time and just forgotten to use it at the times.

0:40:33	SPEAKER_00
 Um... just about changing rules.

0:40:36	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, in a sense, you also want to make sure that the...

0:40:38	SPEAKER_00
...the agreement that you arrive on today that they are consistent with what you have to be formed, right?

0:40:43	SPEAKER_00
 So, I mean, this really only displays those cases where you disagreed.

0:40:46	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:40:47	SPEAKER_00
 But if you sort of like change a rule now on the flight, then that might be...

0:40:50	SPEAKER_00
...that might create inconsistencies.

0:40:52	SPEAKER_00
 You might have followed that.

0:40:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so I'm sure I followed that rule sometimes and just forgotten.

0:40:55	SPEAKER_03
 So, let's take that out.

0:40:57	SPEAKER_03
 Um...

0:40:59	SPEAKER_01
...and...

0:41:04	SPEAKER_03
...and alpha-phones to you?

0:41:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:41:08	SPEAKER_03
 But lime and alpha-phones should be in here because it's not talking about...

0:41:13	SPEAKER_03
...it's not modified.

0:41:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's fine.

0:41:17	SPEAKER_04
 Damp, lime and alpha systems.

0:41:22	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, alpha data.

0:41:24	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, alpha data.

0:41:29	SPEAKER_03
 Data, I think we should keep it.

0:41:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:41:35	SPEAKER_03
 Because it's...

0:41:36	SPEAKER_03
...would be the same as future.

0:41:39	SPEAKER_03
 I...

0:41:40	SPEAKER_03
 I think data is the same as spectrum, because the data is a spectrum.

0:41:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:41:46	SPEAKER_04
 I still don't like it, but...

0:41:48	SPEAKER_04
 Final view book, I don't have passion.

0:41:50	SPEAKER_05
 I wouldn't, I think, now, probably.

0:41:53	SPEAKER_03
 I'll just do ours.

0:42:02	SPEAKER_03
 And this one comes out as well.

0:42:08	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so we want...

0:42:10	SPEAKER_03
...just props.

0:42:11	SPEAKER_04
 No, that's...

0:42:12	SPEAKER_04
...yeah.

0:42:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:42:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:42:17	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:42:20	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:42:25	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:42:30	None
 All right.

0:42:35	None
 All right.

0:42:41	SPEAKER_04
 Oops.

0:42:42	SPEAKER_04
 We're there.

0:42:43	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:42:44	SPEAKER_04
 So what were we looking at this page for anyway?

0:42:46	SPEAKER_04
 H.L. for detection.

0:42:51	SPEAKER_04
 Broadband detections, isn't...

0:42:54	SPEAKER_03
...don't include.

0:42:56	SPEAKER_03
 But I wouldn't...

0:42:57	SPEAKER_05
 Well, H.L. for the line, maybe, isn't it?

0:43:00	SPEAKER_04
 Whether it's only a narrowband detection.

0:43:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:43:03	SPEAKER_04
 A narrowband imaging detection.

0:43:04	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:43:05	SPEAKER_05
 Good.

0:43:06	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:43:08	SPEAKER_03
 H.L. for emitters are not a distinct class of source.

0:43:13	SPEAKER_03
 No, they're not.

0:43:17	SPEAKER_03
 Line?

0:43:21	SPEAKER_00
 Just out of curiosity, this narrow and broadband that refers to the type of spectrogram that you have, like, on the type of filter, or is it...

0:43:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:43:28	SPEAKER_05
 Exactly.

0:43:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, exactly that.

0:43:30	SPEAKER_03
 But I guess if you're picking out a spectral feature with a broadband...

0:43:34	SPEAKER_03
...or not a bad moment, still respect the feature.

0:43:38	SPEAKER_03
 If you're picking out a line, yeah.

0:43:40	SPEAKER_03
 Or you pick it out.

0:43:43	SPEAKER_04
 It's definitely way back over.

0:43:45	SPEAKER_04
 Line on its own.

0:43:48	SPEAKER_03
 It's going to be a lot of those.

0:43:51	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:43:54	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:43:59	SPEAKER_04
 This is another system, so...

0:44:02	None
 Yeah.

0:44:07	SPEAKER_03
 Absorption profiles.

0:44:10	SPEAKER_03
 I think the whole thing should actually be marked.

0:44:16	SPEAKER_03
 Even with complex.

0:44:18	SPEAKER_03
 How fast should we go?

0:44:21	SPEAKER_01
 Just absorption profiles.

0:44:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, absorption profiles are different.

0:44:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:44:40	None
 And...

0:44:42	SPEAKER_03
...laminar for post-lamin, blanketing or laminar for post-lamin.

0:44:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, take out the blank.

0:44:52	None
 What's this?

0:44:57	SPEAKER_03
 Ah, that's...

0:45:01	SPEAKER_01
 Is it a system?

0:45:04	SPEAKER_03
 Ee, yep.

0:45:07	SPEAKER_03
 Do you have the eye as an instrument?

0:45:10	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, is it?

0:45:12	SPEAKER_04
 Now, VRBI is a network.

0:45:14	SPEAKER_04
 What is it?

0:45:15	SPEAKER_05
 VRBI is interferometer.

0:45:17	SPEAKER_05
 It's a technique.

0:45:18	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:45:19	SPEAKER_05
 The network is an instrument, no?

0:45:20	SPEAKER_04
 The instrument.

0:45:21	SPEAKER_04
 What's...

0:45:23	SPEAKER_03
 It's called something else.

0:45:25	SPEAKER_03
 It's called an array.

0:45:27	SPEAKER_03
 It's an array.

0:45:28	SPEAKER_03
 It's an array on the end.

0:45:29	SPEAKER_03
 It would be the...

0:45:30	SPEAKER_04
...histimate.

0:45:31	SPEAKER_04
 This is...

0:45:32	SPEAKER_04
 Well...

0:45:33	SPEAKER_04
...the LBI network image.

0:45:34	SPEAKER_04
 So, do they mean the VLBA?

0:45:36	SPEAKER_05
 It's an all of...

0:45:39	SPEAKER_05
...this is an instrument, if you have it all, isn't it?

0:45:42	SPEAKER_04
 European VLBA.

0:45:43	SPEAKER_04
 It's an instrument, not a research group.

0:45:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, it takes an image.

0:45:48	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, but they don't...

0:45:49	SPEAKER_03
...research, for a second.

0:45:51	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, that's...

0:45:52	SPEAKER_03
 How much of a modifier is we putting in?

0:45:56	SPEAKER_04
 It's only supposed to be proper names.

0:46:00	SPEAKER_04
 But I don't...

0:46:01	SPEAKER_04
 Which it is.

0:46:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's that.

0:46:03	SPEAKER_04
 So, this whole thing is an instrument.

0:46:05	SPEAKER_04
 From 1.6 or...

0:46:06	SPEAKER_03
 That's what I think.

0:46:07	SPEAKER_05
 European.

0:46:08	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, I think it is...

0:46:10	SPEAKER_05
...or just from the LBI.

0:46:13	SPEAKER_05
 Starting with...

0:46:16	SPEAKER_05
...Europe...

0:46:18	SPEAKER_03
...here, I think.

0:46:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think.

0:46:22	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, I say, say, yeah.

0:46:24	SPEAKER_04
 So, is this like, it's a subset of the VLBA?

0:46:27	SPEAKER_05
 Er...

0:46:29	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:46:30	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I know.

0:46:31	SPEAKER_05
 Just in Europe, right?

0:46:34	SPEAKER_05
 But it's actually Merlin and all the international analogues in Europe.

0:46:38	SPEAKER_05
 All hooked up into one instrument, basically.

0:46:43	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:46:44	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:46:46	SPEAKER_04
 That is a source name.

0:46:52	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:46:53	SPEAKER_03
 That's just board banders and that's board animation.

0:47:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's just...

0:47:05	SPEAKER_03
...and that shouldn't be marked.

0:47:07	SPEAKER_03
 Radio loud objects.

0:47:15	SPEAKER_03
 It's not a...

0:47:18	SPEAKER_03
...it's not a...

0:47:19	SPEAKER_03
...body...

0:47:20	SPEAKER_03
...it's not an...

0:47:21	SPEAKER_03
...you know, system.

0:47:22	SPEAKER_04
 We say something about objects and I think it's that we don't.

0:47:25	SPEAKER_04
 Is it?

0:47:26	SPEAKER_03
 Anything any object we don't need to get here.

0:47:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:47:29	SPEAKER_03
 So, none of those.

0:47:34	SPEAKER_02
 Hmm.

0:47:37	SPEAKER_03
 Now, we've both marked nine ratios here.

0:47:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but we shouldn't have done.

0:47:48	SPEAKER_03
 That's the same set.

0:47:50	None
 Yeah.

0:47:53	None
 Okay.

0:47:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:47:55	SPEAKER_04
 That's sort of...

0:47:56	SPEAKER_04
...it's certainly not a source name.

0:47:59	SPEAKER_03
 And though it's different because it shouldn't let me ionize and continue.

0:48:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that means...

0:48:04	SPEAKER_04
 Which is it?

0:48:05	SPEAKER_04
 That's a process.

0:48:06	SPEAKER_04
 It's a process or it's the type of photons that's not looking to be relooking at.

0:48:11	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe even going to land pose.

0:48:16	SPEAKER_03
 Truth.

0:48:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:48:18	SPEAKER_03
 That shouldn't be.

0:48:23	SPEAKER_03
 Hmm.

0:48:24	SPEAKER_01
 You're going to show that.

0:48:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:48:29	SPEAKER_03
 So, glowing.

0:48:32	SPEAKER_03
 You're right there.

0:48:35	SPEAKER_03
 That's all.

0:48:36	SPEAKER_03
 One big, speckful feature.

0:48:40	SPEAKER_03
 And nebula shouldn't be marked.

0:48:44	SPEAKER_04
 Have we agreed on that?

0:48:47	SPEAKER_04
 We only agreed that...

0:48:48	SPEAKER_04
 So far, we've only agreed that we can't include spectral features modifying nebula.

0:48:53	SPEAKER_03
 But I don't see yet where it's written down that you can't mark.

0:48:56	SPEAKER_02
 We did mark nebula.

0:48:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:49:02	SPEAKER_03
 It was things that weren't distinct, like...

0:49:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but there's so many different kinds of nebula, I think, as well as I wasn't doing it.

0:49:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's a difficult one.

0:49:11	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to stick to it.

0:49:13	SPEAKER_04
 Let's take it.

0:49:14	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to happen.

0:49:16	None
 That's what happened.

0:49:20	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah.

0:49:24	SPEAKER_03
 Don't mind.

0:49:27	SPEAKER_03
 Stop being there in your kitchen.

0:49:30	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to do that.

0:49:40	SPEAKER_01
 You're right.

0:49:42	SPEAKER_03
 So, that's sort of...

0:49:49	SPEAKER_03
 Line blanketing.

0:49:51	SPEAKER_01
 I know.

0:49:54	SPEAKER_03
 We had line blanketing just now.

0:49:56	SPEAKER_03
 We included it.

0:49:57	SPEAKER_05
 Did you? I thought it was a process, and it wasn't included.

0:50:02	SPEAKER_03
 What was it?

0:50:05	SPEAKER_04
 We did just have it.

0:50:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:50:07	SPEAKER_04
 It was not for that.

0:50:09	SPEAKER_01
 It wasn't for that.

0:50:11	SPEAKER_03
 It was like a lime and forest line blanketing out.

0:50:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we took line blanketing out.

0:50:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:50:17	None
 I don't think that should be.

0:50:18	None
 Yeah.

0:50:19	None
 That's what happened.

0:50:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:50:23	SPEAKER_04
 That's a source.

0:50:28	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe?

0:50:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:50:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, it is.

0:50:34	SPEAKER_03
 Red and blue components.

0:50:39	SPEAKER_03
 I think you're right there as well.

0:50:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:50:46	SPEAKER_03
 You could say.

0:50:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:50:48	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:50:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:50:55	SPEAKER_03
 In the same way that you can point to soft x-rays or the hard x-rays.

0:51:00	SPEAKER_03
 You can point to the red and the...

0:51:01	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I would argue about that, you see, because I think that you only extract that half to actually modulus perspective.

0:51:08	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you.

0:51:11	SPEAKER_04
 The soft access you can definitely point to on an x-ray thing.

0:51:15	SPEAKER_04
 But there's one there or not.

0:51:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:51:20	SPEAKER_05
 You're saying you wouldn't know it was soft.

0:51:23	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, components, though, is such.

0:51:25	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:51:26	SPEAKER_03
 We're talking about the continuum.

0:51:27	SPEAKER_03
 If you have a dialect spectrum, you can say there's the blue component, there's the red component to this.

0:51:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:51:33	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, so you mean it comes from adding two different things together?

0:51:36	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:51:37	SPEAKER_03
 That's what I'm thinking about.

0:51:39	SPEAKER_05
 I can see that.

0:51:40	None
 Yeah.

0:51:41	SPEAKER_05
 It's actually, we don't...

0:51:45	SPEAKER_05
 Because actually modulus is about to not just actually looking at this spectrum.

0:51:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:51:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:51:49	SPEAKER_04
 I give that for red and blue components, but I wouldn't probably give that for soft components.

0:51:53	SPEAKER_04
 Because a soft access is a... I mean, that's an x-ray thing.

0:51:57	SPEAKER_04
 Like a break, you say.

0:51:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:52:00	SPEAKER_03
 And if you said red or blue would be accessed rather than red or blue component.

0:52:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but...

0:52:03	SPEAKER_05
 I guess the...

0:52:04	SPEAKER_05
 I would component it is...

0:52:05	SPEAKER_05
 It means it's now that we're actually in a model, though.

0:52:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:52:08	SPEAKER_04
 It'd take out red and blue.

0:52:09	None
 Yes.

0:52:11	SPEAKER_04
 Which means maybe we should take out soft.

0:52:15	SPEAKER_04
 Well...

0:52:16	SPEAKER_04
 It's such a basic sort of... you look at a spectrum and you say that's a soft access.

0:52:20	SPEAKER_04
 It's a soft.

0:52:21	SPEAKER_04
 The access is, yeah.

0:52:23	SPEAKER_03
 But...

0:52:24	SPEAKER_03
 If you modelled it with two parts, what...

0:52:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:52:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:52:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:52:29	SPEAKER_03
 Hard and soft to spectrum.

0:52:30	SPEAKER_03
 That's probably...

0:52:31	SPEAKER_03
 Hupbled and houbled deep field south.

0:52:32	SPEAKER_04
 Um...

0:52:33	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know how to group some size.

0:52:38	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't include it.

0:52:40	SPEAKER_03
 Although it does apply to the concept.

0:52:41	SPEAKER_01
 I think I would.

0:52:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:52:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:52:44	None
 Yeah.

0:52:45	SPEAKER_04
 Just keeping...

0:52:46	SPEAKER_04
 So, did we have a soft component earlier?

0:52:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:52:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:52:50	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:52:51	SPEAKER_03
 And you remember when?

0:52:53	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:52:54	SPEAKER_05
 I'll get you pretty early on, I'd have thought.

0:52:57	SPEAKER_03
 It's not really beginning.

0:52:59	SPEAKER_03
 There it is.

0:53:01	SPEAKER_03
 Oh.

0:53:02	SPEAKER_03
 Excellent.

0:53:09	SPEAKER_03
 Um, I...

0:53:11	SPEAKER_03
 Houbled.

0:53:12	None
 No.

0:53:18	SPEAKER_03
 And then, top one, I think, you should include...

0:53:23	SPEAKER_03
 Possibly with flux as well.

0:53:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, okay.

0:53:31	None
 Yeah.

0:53:32	None
 Yeah.

0:53:33	None
 Yeah.

0:53:34	SPEAKER_04
 That's fine, I'll have to...

0:53:39	SPEAKER_03
 And then...

0:53:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:53:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:53:42	None
 Okay.

0:53:43	None
 Oh.

0:53:44	None
 Yeah.

0:53:45	None
 Okay.

0:53:46	None
 Oh.

0:53:47	None
 I heard radio galaxies.

0:53:51	SPEAKER_03
 No, we stay about...

0:53:54	SPEAKER_03
 At Onims were part of it, was useful.

0:53:59	SPEAKER_03
 Um...

0:54:01	SPEAKER_04
 Do we have to make a decision about hyzerbrideogarics?

0:54:07	SPEAKER_04
 Exactly.

0:54:08	SPEAKER_04
 They are discussed as a separate source to our partner.

0:54:12	SPEAKER_01
 Well, are they?

0:54:14	SPEAKER_01
 Um, hyzerbrideogarics.

0:54:16	SPEAKER_05
 Only just...

0:54:18	SPEAKER_05
 Interesting because...

0:54:20	SPEAKER_05
 On the outside.

0:54:21	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:54:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:54:23	SPEAKER_03
 But I don't think you're right.

0:54:24	SPEAKER_03
 Mark, I...

0:54:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:54:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:54:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:54:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:54:31	SPEAKER_04
 What did we say about Aquanims were part of it's useful.

0:54:34	SPEAKER_04
 I think you're supposed to mark the whole thing.

0:54:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, I think you are.

0:54:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:54:38	None
 So you're right.

0:54:39	None
 Um...

0:54:40	None
 C-fit 1.8 and 1.9 galaxies.

0:54:45	SPEAKER_03
 Is a subclassification of C-fit?

0:54:49	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:54:50	SPEAKER_04
 I wouldn't say that would be a subclassification of C-fit.

0:54:55	SPEAKER_04
 No, it would make us...

0:54:57	SPEAKER_04
 You wouldn't say that would be a subclassification of C-fit.

0:55:00	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think we'll do that, I think.

0:55:01	SPEAKER_05
 It's...

0:55:02	SPEAKER_05
...stupid.

0:55:03	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:55:04	SPEAKER_03
 I think they probably are.

0:55:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:55:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:55:09	SPEAKER_03
 It's just...

0:55:10	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not a bit too nice.

0:55:11	SPEAKER_03
 You should like feature with an include.

0:55:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:55:15	None
 Yeah.

0:55:21	SPEAKER_03
 Galaxy Galaxy formation doesn't...

0:55:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:55:24	SPEAKER_04
 And...

0:55:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:55:28	SPEAKER_03
 And now this is one that counts.

0:55:30	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it should be this one, but...

0:55:32	SPEAKER_03
 But what if you don't...

0:55:33	SPEAKER_03
 If these are doubly underlined?

0:55:34	SPEAKER_03
 Has it just plotted the top color?

0:55:36	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, was it actually possible to doubly underline things?

0:55:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:55:41	SPEAKER_00
 Um...

0:55:42	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know which one it would display then.

0:55:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, because what we want...

0:55:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, let's just mark what we want and...

0:55:48	SPEAKER_03
...not that, but with...

0:55:50	SPEAKER_03
...also borderline.

0:55:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:55:53	None
 I can't write.

0:55:55	SPEAKER_00
 I should know that was possible to have this...

0:55:58	SPEAKER_00
...so you allowed to come to bed at...

0:56:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:56:01	SPEAKER_00
...latations, right, okay.

0:56:02	SPEAKER_03
 Because quite often an object class is defined by a spectral feature.

0:56:07	SPEAKER_03
 Mm-hmm.

0:56:08	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:56:09	SPEAKER_03
 Like borderline radio galaxies.

0:56:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:56:11	SPEAKER_03
 Mm-hmm.

0:56:14	None
 Mm-hmm.

0:56:15	SPEAKER_03
 Border lines.

0:56:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:56:18	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think that should go in.

0:56:20	SPEAKER_01
 Just the wrong...

0:56:27	SPEAKER_01
...mode.

0:56:28	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:56:29	SPEAKER_03
...color for a few things.

0:56:30	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, it's over here.

0:56:31	SPEAKER_03
 Hyperluminous galaxy.

0:56:32	SPEAKER_05
 If you're having ultra-luminous...

0:56:35	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:56:36	SPEAKER_05
 Mm-hmm.

0:56:37	SPEAKER_05
...then you have to have hyperluminous here.

0:56:39	SPEAKER_03
 This is just a color issue.

 Is it a...

0:56:43	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, right.

0:56:44	SPEAKER_04
 And QSO is not...

0:56:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:56:46	SPEAKER_04
 You're right.

0:56:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:56:48	SPEAKER_03
 I should have written...

0:56:49	SPEAKER_03

0:56:57	SPEAKER_03

 Let it, let it, let it it go.

0:58:02	SPEAKER_03
 a modified object. Oh no we're doing that either. The question is are emission line objects a separate

0:58:08	SPEAKER_05
 class of source? I think they are. But are you arguing not to have anything with object in it?

0:58:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. Yes you might. And super galaxies should be one. Yes. You've got 270.

0:58:34	SPEAKER_05
