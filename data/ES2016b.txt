0:00:00	None
 you Does he want to talk to you now?

0:00:28	None
 Tsss....

0:00:32	None
 That's him!

0:00:37	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_04
 Thanks for coming to this meeting.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_04
 How are we doing on our remote?

0:00:55	SPEAKER_04
 We have some, we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_00
 Oh yeah.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_00
 I was asked that they were doing it.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_04
 Alright, let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_04
 See if I can't get things moving along here a little bit better.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_04
 I'll go over what we went over last time, which shouldn't take long.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_04
 Then I believe each of you have a presentation.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_04
 It was sent a couple more requirements for our remote, what they want.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_04
 Then we can come to a conclusion on what we want the remote to do, and how it's going to do it hopefully.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_04
 And then we'll have the closing, which we'll have 40 minutes for.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_04
 Let's see, the last meeting, we went over who was responsible for what.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_04
 I'm responsible for leading the meetings, keeping the notes, and coming up with the final presentation.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_04
 Crane is our marketing expert.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_04
 She's going to figure out what the consumer wants.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_04
 Crane is our user interface designer, and Manuel is the industrial designer.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_04
 So you're going to come up with the ideas, Ryan, and you're going to pick them apart.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_04
 We decided our remote, we wanted to be a universal remote that everyone would want.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_04
 We wanted to be modern, fun, different, it needs to be sturdy, easy to find.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_04
 So we're going to have that locator function.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_04
 And we want to be different.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_04
 And then we went over a couple of different ideas, ball-shaped phone, the keyboard shape.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_04
 We decided that it should probably be one-handed, something we could use with one hand.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_04
 And that was our last meeting.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_04
 So why don't do each of you have a presentation?

0:03:31	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, I'll hand it off to you.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_04
 Does anyone want to go first?

0:03:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_04
 So we can maybe see what the people want.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_01
 What was it function?

0:03:51	SPEAKER_03
 Eight.

0:03:52	None
 Okay.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_01
 How do I got it?

0:04:23	SPEAKER_04
 Slime show.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_04
 To go to the next one.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_01
 Well, this is my report, which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that I was sent.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if I can do it.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just pressing the arrow, okay.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry, I actually need to see something else on my screen.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_01
 Hit F8 again.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_01
 I think.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_01
 And then again.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_04
 You want it to be on both screens or just something else on the screen?

0:05:12	SPEAKER_01
 Is that possible?

0:05:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but I think you have to hit escape.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_04
 And then you can.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, but now you don't have that.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, hit F8 again.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry guys.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_04
 I know I didn't send it.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_04
 And then it should come up.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_04
 You're shortly.

0:05:34	None
 Okay.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_01
 So is there no way I can give you the slideshow?

0:05:47	SPEAKER_01
 I think.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, give us a slideshow and something on your screen.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I'm not sure you can maybe minimize that screen and then.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_04
 Have them both up at the same time.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_01
 So first of all, the method that I used was by doing some marketing research by doing research on some interviews that were conducted.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_01
 And then some internet research.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_01
 And I was sent a report that was.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_01
 I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_01
 And so I will show you some of the results from that, which I think will be helpful.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, here are some of the findings.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_01
 They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_01
 And 75% of the users find their remote controls to be ugly, which is a fairly significant number, I would say.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_01
 And 80% of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_01
 So I think that earlier we were on to something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's definitely important.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_01
 And they say the current remote controls do not match well the operating behavior of the user.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_01
 75% of the users said they zap a lot.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_01
 And if anyone could clarify what that means.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_01
 Zap. Does that just mean like seeing the channel?

0:07:15	SPEAKER_01
 Just using it.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_01
 And 50% of the users say that they're only using 10% of the buttons on their remote control.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_01
 There was something else. They kept track of the frequency per hour and using certain buttons.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_01
 And some of them, it looks like barely needs to be included at all.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_01
 Of course, channel selection is used the most frequently.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_01
 And then teletext was the next volume and then power.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_01
 And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_01
 So I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_01
 The biggest user frustrations, as we said, 50% of people find that their remote are lost somewhere.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_01
 And so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_01
 They said it takes 34% said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_01
 And 26% said that the controls are bad for RSI.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_00
 A competitive strategy.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_00
 What is it?

0:08:32	SPEAKER_00
 Just a competitive strategy.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's what I guess.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_01
 And so base.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_01
 As far as speech recognition goes, the younger group looks like they're all for it.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_01
 From the 15 to 25 age group, over 90% said they would pay more.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_01
 And it kind of just went down incrementally.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 The groups at the older they get, it looks like the less willing they are to pay.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe we could discuss this and think.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_01
 Decide if we think it's worth investing in this.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_01
 At least if we're targeting the younger groups.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_01
 And so in conclusion, some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_01
 We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of the remote control.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_01
 A multi functional remote could be a good thing to explore.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_01
 So you only have one rather than five different remote sitting all over your room.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_01
 We need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_01
 Get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_01
 And then lastly, I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_01
 And that's it.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_04
 Very nice.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_04
 Now we actually have some ideas of what what people want, what we should focus on.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_04
 Did you guys get time to write everything that you needed?

0:10:25	SPEAKER_01
 Having just listened to what Cohen's just saying, I'll draw on some of the things as well.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_00
 There's some things that sort of relevant to what I want to say.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm just going to, yeah, approach your technical functions design.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_00
 The method I use was to explore the technical functions of remote control.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_00
 And simply approach that I came to it is to change program and operate an electronic device remotely.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, that's an obvious thing to say, but it's not attached to the device that you want to control.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_00
 I had some things sent to me not very much to look at similar devices, to find and film them, and then personal preferences that I would suggest.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_00
 We discussed a universal one.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_00
 It's just been brought up again then.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_00
 But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design and possibly within maybe the budget that we do it.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_00
 Because you need to know all the specifications of all the electronic companies.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure if you've ever come across a universal remote control yourself, but you have to, there are nightmares to you, you have to set them, reset them to everything.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_00
 And that would only add buttons, whereas I think there needs to take away buttons.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_00
 So I think it would better maybe concentrate on maybe it's a universal one for TVs, or maybe just one that you could design and then different people, manufacturers could use it to set their specifications if the aim is to get something that you need can design.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, here's just two pictures of remote controls, it's just simple TV remote controls.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_00
 But one is user-centered, that is the one on the left.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_00
 You need to straight away see there's less buttons, and the other one is some engineered-centered, where that's more specified fully, sort of the elaborate piece of equipment that's trying to control.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_00
 And that's which appeals more to the product that we want, and on what defines, as I've said, in the market research and stuff, we're probably looking at something that should be user-centered, fewer buttons, simpler to use.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_00
 And if 10% is hidden away, if 10% is what's used, maybe the other 50%, the buttons that are used very early, like programming, they could be hidden, maybe, on some remote controls, you might have come across, and maybe a little flip thing, hidden away, and the main buttons that are on the one you come across.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_00
 And finally, sorry, I'll cover that up, I think, should be used interface-oriented.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_00
 Like I said, to concentrate on TV remote control, the universal remote might be too complex.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_00
 And as what the major findings and market research has just said, is to image the appearance that people dislike, so that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend, and then change the fashion of remote controls.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_00
 And that's it.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, over there.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_04
 What was your last conclusion on that one?

0:14:10	SPEAKER_04
 Focus on the image of it.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_00
 The actual design.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, good, good.

0:14:45	None
 Okay.

0:14:50	None
 I'll talk to you about the working design.

0:14:55	None
 The interior is basically, which is what, dictates the design, both the interface, basically, and the outer appearance, because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_03
 So unfortunately, the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me, obviously, were too drunk to actually accomplish it.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm going to do lots of the stuff on the board.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_03
 This is the basic premise of a remote control.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_03
 The basic function is to send messages to another system.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so much is clear.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_03
 And energy source feeds an integrated circuit, a chip, that can compose messages.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_03
 Often in the form of infrared bits, this is the most mostly used.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_03
 There's also some sound systems, but infrared is the better, the more used system parts are cheaper as well.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_03
 This controls the chip, and accordingly, the messages.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_03
 This is where my people screwed up, basically.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm going to explain that on the board, other.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_03
 What we have is different components that obviously need to go in there, with start with an energy source.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_03
 Usually a battery, since it's not feasible to add a cable to that.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_03
 This energy source, of course, is connected to the user interface itself, which can be buttons, whatever, which in fact, controls a chip.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_03
 This is the user interface, and there we have the chip.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_03
 The way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp that sends out the signal.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, the signal differs accordingly, depending on what the chip tells the infrared lamp.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, that's controlled.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_03
 The chip itself is controlled by the user interface.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_03
 The way you normally do it is that you add a little device, such as a lamp, to the whole thing as well, so that you know that it's working.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_03
 Basically, you press something, you get a response, which is also comparatively important on one of those devices.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_03
 Now, what we're talking about here, or what I think should be discussed, are these two components, mostly the energy source for one thing, can be altered, but we probably cannot alter, is, of course, the infrared, the sending device, basically, the infrared lamp.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_03
 We cannot change the chip, which controls the infrared lamp.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_03
 These two components that we have to use, and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing, the lamp can be put onto the device.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't have to be there.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_03
 This can be discussed as well.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_03
 We use the interface. That's something we can also discuss.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_03
 As we've heard, speech recognition is the hype, obviously, in the moment.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_03
 Speech recognition interface.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_03
 We don't know that, or if we just do the usual button thing, or we have a touchpad, or something like that, that's something we can discuss.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_03
 And, of course, the energy source, batteries, solar cells, who knows.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, it's always a question whether these components are, in fact, available cheap enough, developed enough.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_03
 But that's, I suppose, rather, up to marketing, not you.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_03
 So we can, to the industry of design.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_04
 The more complex we make, and, of course, the more expensive it's going to be.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_04
 But people have said that they would, well, younger generations of people said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_04
 So, possibly, it might be worth the investment.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_00
 I think speech recognition was one of those things where, it has to be really good for them to work.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_00
 Sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and over, and you'll be something you've found.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_04
 I agree.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_00
 So, taking some languages, and then different dialects, I suppose.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_04
 Myself, I find when you, when there's something that speaks, speech recognition, like you call on the phone, and you try to change your telephone or power or something.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_04
 Sometimes they have a speech recognition on the other end, and you say one for this, and you find yourself, like you said, saying the same thing over and over and over.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_04
 I find myself, especially if I'm in a crowd of people looking really silly.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_04
 So, maybe if you're sitting on your couch with a bunch of people, then...

0:21:02	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if, would you want to keep saying stuff?

0:21:06	SPEAKER_00
 If you're watching something, would you sort of...

0:21:09	SPEAKER_04
 Volume up, volume down, change the channel, you know, channel up, channel down.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_01
 Another thing about these figures is 91% of the youngest age groups said they'd do it, but probably a lot of them, that's actually there's parents money.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_01
 Like, I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this, themselves, a 15-year-old, you know?

0:21:30	SPEAKER_00
 As well, the gimmick factor.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_04
 It's a gimmick factor that they like at first, and...

0:21:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, well.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_00
...get old here.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_04
 Let's see here.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_00
 Cold money.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I guess so.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_04
 Tried jack.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_04
 Now, I was sent a couple of things to modify our...

0:22:09	SPEAKER_04
...new requirements.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_04
 The remote's only going to be for the television, which is good because we already decided...

0:22:16	SPEAKER_04
...your research showed that not only is the universal remote more complicated, it's more costly, and your research showed that, you know, most of the people don't even use it.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_04
 I think you said 50% of the people only use half the...

0:22:35	SPEAKER_04
...or 10% of the buttons.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_04
 So, if we remove the universal remote, then that solves that problem.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_04
 No teletext.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_04
 So, we don't have to worry about that.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_04
 But we do have to use the company wants us to incorporate the corporate color and our slogan, which is, we put the fashion in electronics.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_04
 And our corporate colors are gray and yellow.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_04
 And we could probably get away with black too, but...

0:23:15	SPEAKER_04
 So, those are the three...

0:23:18	SPEAKER_04
...the three new requirements that I was told we need to use.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_04
 From all three of your presentations, I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_04
 We want something that looks good.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_04
 We want something that's simple.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_04
 We want something that you can find easily.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_04
 And the speech recognition, I guess, is kind of a give or take.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_04
 It's going to cost more.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_04
 The younger people say that they like it, but...

0:23:58	SPEAKER_04
 It's probably, I would say probably not worth the investment at this point in time.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_04
 So, maybe we should just do away with speech recognition.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_04
 And that way we can focus on our form.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_00
 I did have a thought about the...

0:24:19	SPEAKER_00
...so the tracking thing.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_00
 It came with maybe a holder.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_00
 Or a holster, whatever you want to call it.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_00
 You should put it back in.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_00
 If you don't put it back in, you press something like a little bit more on that.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_00
 It just sends out a beat to find where it is, isn't it?

0:24:38	SPEAKER_00
 I didn't forget to mention me too, complex.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_04
 That would be good if we were going with our ball.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_04
 Or with any form that would be good.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_04
 That could be the charger for...

0:24:55	SPEAKER_04
 We could use rechargeable batteries in the remote.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_04
 And that would be solar.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_04
 However you wanted to go about it, the holder could also be the charging unit.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_04
 With the locator button.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_04
 And if it were the ball, you'd no longer have to have a flat space on it.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_04
 And if we still have this, you just hold on to it.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you put it on the couch table while you're watching.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_03
 So that's not what I was thinking.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_04
 So after the meeting, we'll have some questionnaires.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_04
 And some summaries for what's going on.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_04
 Then we'll take lunch.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_04
 We can come back and work on our individual work.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_04
 I'll do the minutes.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_04
 Let's see.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_04
 It looks like you're already on your way for working with the components.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_04
 Chips.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_04
 What chips we need and what...

0:26:38	SPEAKER_04
 How to power it and whatnot.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_04
 We want to use our interface concept.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_04
 We want it to be something simple.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_04
 Minimal number of buttons.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_04
 I guess our main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_04
 Did you have time earlier to work on that?

0:27:19	SPEAKER_04
 Did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done?

0:27:27	SPEAKER_00
 I'll try to look at the actual opinions in my next break.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_00
 I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately 100 balls.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_00
 Probably not going to do anything.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_00
 Something like that might be difficult.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_00
 I think it still has a bit of variation.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_00
 I know that's angry, but maybe not.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_00
 Boy, there's players around.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_04
 Should we maybe shoot for a specific target group?

0:28:06	SPEAKER_04
 That way we could...

0:28:09	SPEAKER_04
 If we are shooting for young guys, then it's a certain look to the remote or girls or older people.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_04
 Do you think that would help us find a specific form that we would want to pick out?

0:28:33	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if that might come up.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_00
 I might be trying to watch you.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_00
 Do you find anything for all of that?

0:28:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, not yet, but maybe by the next meeting we'll have something to learn.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_04
 So we know that the remote is going to have to be...

0:29:06	SPEAKER_04
 Let's just say we've got a color scheme for it.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yellow and yellow.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_04
 It's nice and bright with the buttons being gray or black and our slogan pasted somewhere on it on the bottom.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we could sketch.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_04
 So basically, all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we could flare it or something, you know?

0:29:54	SPEAKER_04
 So it's more...

0:29:56	SPEAKER_04
 Of course, this will look like a bone then.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_04
 Let's go ahead and erase this.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_04
 Hope everyone memorized that.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it might be to look at the shape and trend of things like mobile phones and shapes that they've been going...

0:30:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, they've gone from big brick block things which still don't move on.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's always sort of slinky, small things.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, everybody's got a mobile phone.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_04
 Right?

0:30:38	SPEAKER_04
 Except for me now.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_04
 But they are all mobile phones.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_04
 They've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_04
 Which made to feed our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_04
 But then again, you don't want the first mobile phone that was this big and you had a handbag to carry it around in.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_04
 So we've got basically what the remotes look like now is kind of what we're...

0:31:22	SPEAKER_04
 What we're stuck with.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we could go with a square or something.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_04
 You know, with minimal number of buttons.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_04
 I guess you've got, you know, one through nine.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_04
 You're typing in your channels.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_04
 You've got volume up and down.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_04
 Channel up and down.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_01
 Power.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_04
 Power.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_04
 Usually at the top.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_04
 A mute.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_04
 That's the classic design.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_04
 That's pretty much all you need, I think.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_04
 A menu button.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_04
 If you want the remote to do other things like...

0:32:39	SPEAKER_04
 Or I guess the TV to be able to change the tint and the color and all those kind of things that are built into TVs.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_04
 We just have that under one standard menu button where you go in.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_04
 Press the menu button.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_04
 Scroll up and down to select it.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_03
 So we're looking at which maybe scrolling function is not too bad.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_03
 Talk about maybe...

0:33:07	SPEAKER_03
 Look at that from the side.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_03
 Which is technically the easiest option.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_03
 It would probably be scrolling wheel like this.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_04
 Like a wheel on your mouse.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_03
 So you can even...

0:33:29	SPEAKER_03
 If we're coming from mice, we can add a click function where you verify the information you just press it down.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_03
 It's a good idea.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_03
 Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing, if you want to make it square for the looks of it.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_03
 Then maybe...

0:33:44	SPEAKER_03
 Make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_03
 And then you can just bulge down here.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_03
 Which maybe from an engineering point, this could be holding the batteries and so on.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_02
 I know.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_03
 You know what I'm getting at here.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, from the side.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_03
 You like that.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_03
 Then you hold it in your hand like this.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the...

0:34:15	SPEAKER_03
 The side.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe the buttons could decrease the bigger ones.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_00
 You know, that has to be bigger in size and the ones that are less important.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_03
 You can also have maybe talking about mobile phones again, lighting open.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_03
 With the lesser used functions, the bit less hard and then slides into that part.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly. Just pinch the catch. Just simply like on a side view.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_00
 Something that you know would sort of fit in the hand better.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_00
 So you need to sort of have your hand.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, it's just thinking this...

0:34:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_00
 This of course causes...

0:34:54	SPEAKER_03
 Causes a problem for left or right-handed people.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so such a film.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_00
 That, yeah, instantly.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm always going for the right-handed person.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it's the old...

0:35:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, is everyone...

0:35:11	SPEAKER_04
 Who in here is right-handed left-handed?

0:35:14	SPEAKER_04
 You guys already have this.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, so I'm left-handed.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_04
 So I can say that most things are designed for right-handed people.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_04
 That's right.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_04
 Like the written language.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_04
 Or English.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_04
 Special order.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, it should be probably designed for right-handed people.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_04
 But that's good.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_04
 I think we've got kind of a good plan there.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_04
 At least for what buttons we're going to use.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_04
 So we've got...

0:36:00	SPEAKER_04
 I like the scroll, the scroll action, and the...

0:36:06	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, I'm just thinking maybe...

0:36:11	SPEAKER_00
 If it was circular.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_00
 With this sort of...

0:36:23	SPEAKER_00
 That sort of earlier idea we had, with a way that was more like that.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_00
 Whereas this is just a one-handed thing that you sort of almost...

0:36:31	SPEAKER_00
 We're at a round of thumb.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_00
 So you'd have your hand into the other thumb there.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_00
 You'd have all the buttons sort of round here.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_00
 And that, I think, could work.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_00
 On any hand, kind of like holding it.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_00
 If you just had it like right around there, left or right.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_03
 Minimizes it size-wise.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_00
 Minimizes it size.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_00
 And then you'd have to...

0:36:57	SPEAKER_03
 You know, very quite small.

0:37:00	None
 Then there's maybe...

0:37:03	SPEAKER_03
 Another point of making it.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_03
 The two-in-one kind of thing.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_03
 If we have a smaller...

0:37:11	SPEAKER_03
 A smaller device that actually fits into the big one.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_03
 You have full functions in here.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_03
 And just a couple of functions in there.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_03
 Like your...

0:37:20	SPEAKER_03
 Zep.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_03
 Minimizes just channels up down volume.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_03
 And on off.

0:37:27	SPEAKER_03
 That's it.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_04
 So two remotes in one.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_04
 But then would be easier to lose...

0:38:11	SPEAKER_04
 One for the other.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_03
 That's right.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_03
 The big one has to be sufficiently big.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_03
 And perhaps heavy, so you can't move it around.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_03
 Make it a piece of furniture.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_03
 It actually is your coffee table.

0:38:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_03
 So there you go.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_03
 Stay tuned.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we need to finish up here.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_04
 So for the next...

0:38:44	SPEAKER_04
 So for the next...

0:38:46	SPEAKER_04
 Before the next meeting...

0:38:50	SPEAKER_04
 Shall we work on...

0:38:53	SPEAKER_04
 You're watching trends to see what kind of new information we've got going on.

0:39:00	SPEAKER_04
 Manual, you're going to work on the components for what we're going to use.

0:39:05	SPEAKER_04
 Let's go with our rounded...

0:39:11	SPEAKER_04
 Kind of fit in your hand.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_04
 Let's explore the possibility of having the two piece.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_04
 So one for the quick-to-zapping and possibly one, you know, with just that rounded part that fits into your hand.

0:39:29	SPEAKER_04
 And Ryan, you work on how well they'll work with the user.

0:39:37	SPEAKER_04
 So both of those concepts.

0:39:44	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, I think we made some good progress here.

0:39:49	SPEAKER_04
 We'll see you in...

0:39:51	SPEAKER_04
 I guess we'll take lunch in about half an hour.

0:39:57	SPEAKER_04
 Or I guess we'll be taking lunch shortly.

0:40:00	SPEAKER_04
 And then in about half an hour after that, we'll probably have another meeting.

0:40:05	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.
