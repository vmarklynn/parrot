0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 My mouth is not working anymore.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to put it in.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_02
 It's going to beep beep beep.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I've got a nice little screen here over here.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_01
 I've got this big black border on every side.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_00
 OK.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_00
 OK.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_00
 Everybody ready?

0:00:49	SPEAKER_00
 I'll fix it.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we're going with the functional design meeting.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_00
 Again, presented by Martin.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_00
 This is the agenda opening.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_00
 We've got three presentations.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_00
 And I'm going to show you some of the new project requirements that were sent to me.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_00
 And we're going to make a decision on the remote control functions.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_00
 We have 40 minutes.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_00
 Well, this is the closing already.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_00
 So well, we start off with the first presentation.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_00
 I think we have to do it in the right order.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you don't know what the right order is.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to do it.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we should start with the technical functions.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_02
 How can I get this on the one board?

0:01:39	SPEAKER_00
 You don't file in the project document folder.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_00
 You've already done that?

0:01:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:01:45	None
 And that one.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_00
 Well, let's close this one.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_00
 We'll just open the new one there.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, you're saying?

0:02:02	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_00
 I have to say something.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_00
 Due to some technical problems, I haven't digitized the last meeting minutes.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_00
 But I'll make sure that happens next time.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_00
 And I'll get this one in digital form too.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_02
 We're going to talk about working design.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_02
 Method of the remote control is electrical energy.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_02
 It activates a chip in the remote.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_02
 It's an electrical circuit which compose messages in the form of infrared signals to control the television.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_02
 It's nowadays very known technology.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_02
 The known technology can make the cost very low.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_02
 It's a wide tail of remote controls in the world.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_02
 And the components are very cheap.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_02
 Diode's batteries and lead lights, they're needed.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_02
 And they're everywhere available against a fair price.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_02
 It's common technology.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_02
 I could tell the circuit board, it's the most important part of the remote control.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_02
 We can use for that fiberglass with copper wires.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_02
 It can be made as fast as printing paper.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_02
 It's all very making it all the time.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_02
 And it's not very specialized technology.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_02
 I haven't come to here, but I've got some images of remote controls.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_02
 They were not very trendy or just a remote control, like everyone knows.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_02
 So I don't know why I should put it here.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it's the technical side of the remote control.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, but I haven't made it because of the time.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_00
 OK.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, let's skip that part time.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_00
 But you don't think it's a problem to design the technical part of the remote control.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_00
 It's going to be easy.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_00
 OK.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_03
 But nothing restricted for a user interface.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_02
 No, it's just a part of a known technology.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_02
 Remote control is nothing special nowadays.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_00
 Regardless of what type of functions we want to implement, it doesn't really matter.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think so because of the old televisions, there are a few, maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_02
 But is it useful to put them on a standard remote?

0:05:36	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we'll see.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_00
 We'll see later on.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the technical functions.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if you've got the same pictures as I got.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_03
 I got these two.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_03
 And I think we have to focus on the one hand, the expert view or the novice user.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's very much depending on the user requirements.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know who is.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_00
 Well, there will be some user requirements later on.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's very important to what kind of functions there we want to put in the remote control.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we'll keep this in mind and discuss it later on.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we can put functions in it when we get user requirements.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_03
 And we can update it.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_00
 There's a big distinction between the style of remote.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_00
 We should choose one.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_00
 We should not compromise, but really choose for experts viewer or novice.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_00
 I agree.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that's what you want trying to say.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_03
 Well, yeah.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_03
 If you want to try a huge market, if you want to reach a huge market, like LVP people, we have to choose for novice user.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_03
 But I don't know.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_03
 It's really depending on how far the remote controls are already in use.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_00
 Well, some of them, yeah.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_00
 But it will be more clear when we come to some of the new requirements.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_00
 Probably.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_03
 Well, there are at least basic functions, like just the channels, one, two, nine, all in an off which must be clear with a red button or something like that.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_03
 Most standard volume, of course, and a mute function.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_03
 And of course, the next and previous channel.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's just basic what we need.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_03
 And from that on, we can see it's huge requirements for what we need more.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_03
 I just thought Yos was looking at the trendy, the trends in the market.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_03
 And I don't know if there are any, if you put more functions, more buttons, maybe it's becoming less trendy or something like that.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_03
 You can just.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_03
 You can just find a conclusion like that.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_03
 You can keep it in mind.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_03
 I thought with less buttons, you can make a more trendier design.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, more trendier design, I think.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_03
 Sounds interesting.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that's all I say.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_00
 Well, then the marketing expert can.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_00
 Tell us something about the current market.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_01
 I've done some research for functional requirements.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_01
 The working method.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 There were 100, 100 people, how do you say, watched using remote control in the usability lab?

0:09:08	SPEAKER_01
 And they also filled out a questioner with a few questions.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_01
 I've lined them up here.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_01
 Ask whether common remote control looks good or not about willingness to spend money on remote control about zapping behavior and stuff like that.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_01
 I've found some interesting things.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_01
 We do got a market.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_01
 Three out of four people claim to find remote controls ugly.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_01
 So if we make a trendier design, we sure have 75% of the market which we can reach.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_01
 Three out of four users zaps a lot, as I quoted here from the results.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_01
 Zap buttons are used for 168 times per hour.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_01
 That's quite a lot.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_01
 Relevant options are, of course, power buttons, although only used once per hour.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_01
 Channel selection, volume and buttons for text.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_01
 And the more other functions like audio settings, video settings, sound settings are not said to be very important.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_01
 It's very much used.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_01
 Furthermore, 50% says they only use 10% of the buttons on the remote control.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_01
 That doesn't say we can leave 90% off, but it sure says we shouldn't make it too complicated.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_01
 50% also claims to have last remote control very often in the world.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_01
 An important thing here.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_01
 The most important customers, which is over 70% of our market is in the age range of 36 to 65 years old.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_01
 And elderly people, our market, are less interested in nice features, but more willingly to spend more money on remote control.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_01
 What I was thinking, wrong side, we shouldn't implement too much features on our remote control because elderly people will get last group features for a higher usability, what I was claiming in the previous meeting.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_01
 All the settings about audio settings, video settings and audio settings, which are not very often used, we could group them on one button and make them accessible in one menu button or whatever because they are used very rarely.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_01
 There are a lot of options there, so we can really make, yeah, how do you say?

0:12:12	SPEAKER_01
 We can spare buttons over there.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_01
 If you want to implement PCR and DVD options, group them in the button not to, yeah, small buttons, so they won't be very, how do you say?

0:12:30	SPEAKER_01
 Especially presence.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, won't be very present.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 And a trendy look, although 70% of the market consists of elderly people who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever, I guess it can do no harm to make a trendy for the other 30%.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_01
 That was kind of what I found.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_00
 Well, then we, I'm going to show you some of the new project requirements and then we're going to discuss on what features we find important.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_00
 Some of the new requirements make some of your findings quite irrelevant, I think.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_00
 Because, decided to put, they have to set two additional requirements forward.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I see four.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_00
 This is kind of strange.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_00
 Well, they say that the data text becomes outdated since the popularity of the Internet.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I think that may be so, but, well, we can't just leave the data text button off.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_00
 No, I agree.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_00
 I agree.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_00
 So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button, you know, like on and off and don't make a lot of special, put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or, you know, it's just you want, you want to be able to make use of teletext but not to play with it that much.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to think of that.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_00
 The remote controls should only be used for the television.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_00
 Otherwise, the project becomes more complex, which endangers the time to market.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe we should leave all DVD and VCR related features off completely.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's what they're trying to say.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_00
 Our current customers are within the age group of 40 plus.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_00
 New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than 40.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_00
 So you talked about the elderly where we're willing to spend more on the remote control and we're interested, but, well, they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger, I don't really

0:14:41	SPEAKER_01
 agree actually, to be honest. It's a very small market which we will approach then if we want to reach customers younger than 40.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_01
 It's only like 30% of the total market.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but it's the fact that the bigger market you're talking about, we already covered it.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_00
 Our company already sells remote control to the older people, but we also want a new customer group.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_00
 That's the one we haven't covered yet.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_00
 So I think that's what the problem is.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_00
 We haven't got remote controls for you.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can compromise a little bit.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think so.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe not too much then.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants and maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group but isn't that bad for a older person either.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_00
 Our corporate image should stay recognizable in our products.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_00
 Our product, corporate color and slogan must be implemented in a new design.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, something is nice to know.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_03
 What else are slogan?

0:15:44	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry?

0:15:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_00
 We have to look that up.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'll have a look.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_00
 We figured something about electronics.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_00
 I thought it might be, let's make things better or something.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_00
 Sensors and simplicity.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well, let's go back to the agenda.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_00
 So if not the three presentations we know about the new project requirements.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_00
 That means we can discuss under remote control functions.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if I can make a start, I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control is going to be and I already talked about maybe you're talking about remote control that has the can opener underneath it.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_00
 I think we're looking for some, we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic TV functions.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_01
 Well, to be honest, if our aim group is still 40, not older than 40, maybe that's not very, we don't really need to have a simple remote control.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_01
 I think we can implement more functions then because basically the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology and therefore will be a more.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_00
 That's why a lot of the requirements, the account managers send me, I think they are contradicting each other because they want a simpler design and no other functions in just the fee but they do aim at the younger.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_03
 But I think it's a lot of functions that aren't used.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_03
 So why should we put a function in?

0:17:30	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I think younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than more functions.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think we can make some discussions in functions.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_00
 You have different kind of equipment in your room, like a TV and a DVD player.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_00
 You can put very detailed functions regarding the TV set on your remote control with audio settings and screen settings.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_00
 We don't want that. I think that was, that became clear.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we should put something, I know that the younger people most likely have a DVD player.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_00
 They want to control remotely.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_03
 But the functions are not in the remote control we are making.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_00
 The user requirements of the new project requirements still is not too, but maybe, I think we maybe should put some functions for other equipment on it.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_00
 But just the basic functions, maybe like wind and wind.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_02
 What do you guys want?

0:18:44	SPEAKER_02
 Not much more than that.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_00
 As far as possible.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_01
 Or we could put them behind the flip flap or whatever.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_00
 What do you think?

0:18:53	SPEAKER_00
 Should we implement functions to control other devices?

0:18:59	SPEAKER_00
 No, you don't think so.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_00
 No, the new requirements.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_02
 But you can put a play and stop.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_00
 Well, maybe it's something, most of the time these functions don't support particular devices as well as their own remote control.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_00
 A lot of DVD players have some tricky settings.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_03
 If it's too simple, they won't use the remote control.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_03
 They use their own.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_01
 For example, a VCR, that's a better example in this case.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_01
 I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to program the VCR to start recording at 3pm or whatever.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_00
 But you can also do it with a play, stop, rewind and fast forward.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_00
 I have to think DVD.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_00
 I know.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_00
 From my experience, a lot of DVD players, like forwarding, goes differently.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_00
 You could do 2 speed or 8 speed or 16 speed.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_00
 Sometimes a bit difficult.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe if we just leave the DVD functionality.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_00
 I was thinking about putting it in.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_00
 But concerning the project requirements.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_00
 You should focus on the TV then.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_03
 Keep it simple and look more.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_00
 It's just a complementary remote and not a universal one.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_00
 If you want to keep it simple, you can make a universal remote.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_00
 It's only for television.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_00
 It should be something that is like gadget on your coffee table.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_00
 It's just when you jump on the couch, you pick up the nice remote, a simple one, just to put on the television, nothing more.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_00
 Nothing more.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_02
 But what will you be able to handle a whole market?

0:20:37	SPEAKER_02
 There are dozens of remote controls.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_00
 We'll make this one trendy.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_00
 Simple.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_00
 We will come to that.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_00
 First on the functions.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_00
 So we should put zap buttons on it.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_00
 Also numbers to go to this specific channel.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, definitely.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_03
 It's too much integrated.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_00
 A teletext button should be there, but just one big teletext button on and off.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, maybe two or three other options.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_01
 But not nothing more than that.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_01
 I think stop function is very useful if you have a page with consist of more pages and you are not a very quick reader.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_01
 Then I think it's very irritating if the next page shows up.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_00
 I think it becomes too difficult.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_00
 It's not a very common function.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_00
 Wow.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_00
 I use a fairly remote action.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_01
 I use it.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, maybe you do.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_00
 I've never heard of it in the first place.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_00
 We have to look at the market.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and teletext is becoming outdated.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_00
 We just want to see what programs are on and what time it is probably.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's kind of getting too complex for our remote.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know what you're using.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_03
 I think.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's Sunday.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_03
 I always use it for the sucker.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but do you like to have such a stop button?

0:22:00	SPEAKER_00
 Do you think it's a kind of a very rare and special function?

0:22:06	SPEAKER_03
 When you look, for example, a couple of weeks ago, I looked at the flights.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_03
 There are a lot of flights in one page.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_00
 But that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, you could have it.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_00
 In the use of the environment.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_02
 There are some buttons you can put it to access all the same pages.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_00
 Well, yeah, lots of new televisions can store pages, you know, and then you can just skip manually through them using.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_00
 I think we just put one teletext button on it.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_00
 Then we meet the new requirements.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_00
 We also meet the other thing.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_00
 We have to choose for the simple design, I guess.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_00
 What functions do we have to decide on?

0:22:55	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if we specifically name all the functions we want.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_00
 We have the zebbunds, the volume.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_00
 We do make them very big, the zebbunds.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_00
 I think the plus and the minus, but that's considered to be 20 as well.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you should place them on a kind of joystick.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, something special way to zeb through the...

0:23:25	SPEAKER_00
 It has to be...

0:23:27	SPEAKER_00
 In quick, you have to use it very quickly.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_01
 If you grab the remote, your hand should be on top of the plus.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_00
 The buttons should make it possible to zeb through your channels in a rapid base.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_00
 What should we decide on them?

0:23:49	SPEAKER_00
 I think in the case of this simple remote control, the technical aspects which weren't worked out already, but it shouldn't be a problem then.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_02
 No, it's just signals.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe...

0:24:01	SPEAKER_02
 And the television does the rest.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_00
 No, okay, but we don't have to.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_00
 When we don't want to control other devices, I think it makes it even more simpler.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_03
 The batteries maybe, if you use large batteries or small batteries...

0:24:17	SPEAKER_02
 I think standard batteries.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_00
 I think we should use...

0:24:21	SPEAKER_00
 Not the watch kind of...

0:24:24	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it has to be simple when I...

0:24:27	SPEAKER_00
 The most ordinary batteries.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_00
 Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_00
 How much time do we have left?

0:24:37	SPEAKER_02
 I think about 20 minutes.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_02
 But in a way we have to be special.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, okay.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_00
 But that's...

0:24:48	SPEAKER_00
 If you think about that, thought about that.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_00
 How we can...

0:24:51	SPEAKER_00
 What the extra touch can be?

0:24:53	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe just the design or the shape or some gadget kind of future.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_00
 Or what's something about how we lose them?

0:25:01	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it should be a remote control.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_00
 When you clip your hands, it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's more for...

0:25:09	SPEAKER_01
 For an age range of 10 to 12 or whatever.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_00
 A lot of people like to have such kind of gate kind of things.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_00
 It should be like a birthday present or something that you get someone in.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_00
 That's a good one.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_00
 Or maybe it should have a big light that can flash for something on it.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_00
 Or...

0:25:33	SPEAKER_00
 Or the can open it.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it contains some future that you don't normally link to a remote control.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's very important because we're going to make such a basic remote control.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_00
 We have to do something to make it special.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_00
 It's going to cost 25 euros.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_01
 I think the can opener is brilliant idea actually.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_01
 But the television and beer is not a rare combination.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's true.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_00
 And I think it's going to be very...

0:25:59	SPEAKER_00
 It has to be sturdy or something.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_00
 Or maybe with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_00
 It has to be something special.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_00
 It has to...

0:26:12	SPEAKER_00
 People when they buy it, they have to think about this one less for a long time.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_00
 We're really going to use it not something you throw away next week.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_00
 No, that's true.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe I think that when we decide on these types of functions, basic functions, it's very important to find something like that.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_00
 So there's a very important task for you.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can all think about it.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_00
 Also for you, maybe it's very nice when you can be trending as a friend.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_00
 You're friendly as well.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_00
 So big buttons, flashy design, maybe some kind of gauges kind of thing.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, a swappable front or whatever.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_00
 Or just different colors would be...

0:26:56	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if people also want to spend more money on fronts for their...

0:27:00	SPEAKER_00
 You might control it too.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you never know.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_03
 More money for us.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_00
 And I think we have to make it quite big.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_03
 Quite big?

0:27:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, definitely.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_00
 Definitely.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_00
 Also because it's expensive, it wanted to be something.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't have much function.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_00
 You don't want to get it all.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_01
 It should be visible nearly anywhere in the room.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_01
 As I said during my presentation, 50%.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_00
 And it should not look nice when you put it on a table.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_00
 I think you might want to put it standard.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it stands up.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_00
 You have to put it on its...

0:27:37	SPEAKER_00
 So it's like a vase or something you put on a table.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_00
 A vase?

0:27:40	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if you put it on a table.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_00
 More like a statue.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_00
 It's like a statue or something.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, I see what you're doing.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_03
 It's like four phones.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_00
 But you also can put it somewhere...

0:27:49	SPEAKER_01
 If you do that, but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of 12 and a half euro.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_01
 In the base, we could make a button and if you push it, the remote control itself makes noise.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_01
 That's probably stupid.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_01
 But as I found here, 50% was it 50?

0:28:10	SPEAKER_01
 That's the first time.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_01
 50% often loses the remote control.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but when it gets lost, how can you press the button to make it?

0:28:20	SPEAKER_01
 No, off the base.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_03
 The thing you put it in.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, man, that's kind of nice.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_00
 And then also you don't even need batteries because you can make it chargeable.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you can make it a chargeable one, yeah.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_00
 Why not?

0:28:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but, yeah, I think it might be...

0:28:39	SPEAKER_00
 Why not?

0:28:40	SPEAKER_00
 We don't...

0:28:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, maybe you...

0:28:42	SPEAKER_00
 We don't know much about production costs, but when you can imagine that when you spend 25 euros on a remote control and it's basically promoting control and then the money, there must be money to spend on that kind of rechargeable...

0:28:56	SPEAKER_01
 It should only cost 12 and a half euros, of course.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but we do it in Taiwan and so it's not going to be dead.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a great idea.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's a good idea.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_00
 Some kind of bag.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_00
 I've never seen that before.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_00
 You make it...

0:29:12	SPEAKER_00
 You see it with the...

0:29:14	SPEAKER_00
 The mouses now.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, definitely.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, but it's handy.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_00
 Well, you can recharge it, so you never have the battery problem.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_00
 That's one thing.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_00
 You can always find a lot of control about the handings.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_02
 It's got a couple of controls.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_02
 Remote controls nowadays can last two years, three years with two batteries.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_00
 Well, maybe you could...

0:29:36	SPEAKER_00
 And when it's too costly, you could probably skip the recharge.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_00
 But you do need...

0:29:41	SPEAKER_00
 Also, you would need a battery in the base unit as well, you know?

0:29:46	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you could connect that to 220 volts, of course.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but that's not...

0:29:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but then it's very easy to make it also rechargeable.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think that is going to cause much to make it also rechargeable.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_00
 No, function in it.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_01
 On the other hand, if you don't do it, we can also make a nice bay.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it looks trendy and still put the bleep function in it.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_01
 I think the bay is definitely...

0:30:13	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a good idea.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_00
 And make it...

0:30:16	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it isn't most costly remote control.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_00
 We can save on the functions.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_00
 We just put some simple buttons in it, make it big and sturdy, nothing more.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_00
 And just make sure there's some noise that it can make, or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_00
 That it lights up.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_00
 Sure, why not?

0:30:37	SPEAKER_00
 It's also nice.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_00
 And as you put away, I think it's...

0:30:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_00
 We have to...

0:30:42	SPEAKER_00
 It's an easy market.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_00
 We have to do something special.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_00
 And for 25 euros, people want something special from your remote control.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_00
 And we can deliver that in regards to the functions because we aren't going to...

0:30:53	SPEAKER_01
 With eye candy, ear candy, whatever.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, definitely.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_00
 And then when you make it a nice looking shape, and then also you got the stand up thing.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a good idea.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it must be a gadget to have.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, definitely.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we'll see what's possible concerning the costs, and if it's possible, we'll do that.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_00
 And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_00
 And the first thing we most likeable thing to skip is the probability recharge function or something.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_00
 If that's too expensive, we won't do that.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_00
 But it would be nice.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_00
 It would be nice, yes.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_00
 It's the idea.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_00
 I know the batteries last long nowadays.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_00
 But people just think about, oh, I'll never have to buy any batteries again.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_00
 Because it's very annoying when your battery is empty.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_00
 And when you have some batteries around, and probably for two weeks, I think...

0:31:46	SPEAKER_01
 Most television is break down before the battery pack is empty.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_00
 So easy functions?

0:31:52	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I think we'll work that out, stepping, numbers on it.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_03
 Or just if it beep when the batteries are down.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, why not?

0:32:02	SPEAKER_00
 But it's also annoying.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_00
 Because as long as it keeps working, you're not very motivated to do something about it.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_00
 No, that's true.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_00
 And you don't want to have those problems.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_00
 And you won't have, if you have to rechargeable.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_00
 And you don't have to use the unit.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_00
 You can also put it on the side if people don't like it.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_00
 But you pay for it.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but I mean, they pay for it because they think, oh, that's a great idea.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to use it.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_00
 And when time goes by and they think, oh, I'll never put them in a recharge, I don't think it lasts long enough, then they put it on the side and they can use it now and then.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_00
 And when they look...

0:32:40	SPEAKER_00
 I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control within a couple of months, they will be in the situation that they're seeking for their remote control.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_00
 They want to see something quick and they just push the button and I think really...

0:32:51	SPEAKER_00
 Leave, leave all their days.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_00
 I've never...

0:32:54	SPEAKER_00
 It's so simple, but I've never seen it.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_03
 I ain't going to leave it just there.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you should really...

0:32:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_00
 Now, well, how much time have you got left?

0:33:05	SPEAKER_00
 These clocks are in sync.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_00
 Well, ladies.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_00
 So we have 10 minutes or something?

0:33:12	SPEAKER_00
 Something like that.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but we're done.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_00
 I think.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_00
 We've decided on the functions.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_00
 Well, there's some...

0:33:22	SPEAKER_00
 There is a closing sheet.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_00
 We have lunch break and then we have 30 minutes of individual work.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:33:31	None
 Okay.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_00
 I'll make sure I had some problems with digitizing the first minutes.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_00
 The next minutes won't be a problem, but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too, but maybe it won't work, but you'll see.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_00
 I think these are more important than the first one.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_03
 Can you make an...

0:33:50	SPEAKER_03
 A part of folder for the minutes?

0:33:54	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, that's everything in one.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_00
 Five minutes.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, five minutes.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because I did...

0:34:00	SPEAKER_00
 The first minutes I did were a bit scratch, you know.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_00
 Then I did a second one with a nicer layout, which I could use for the other ones as well, but I think I forgot to put done under the first one, and when you go right in second, it's not working when you try to write a second paper or something.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, that's fine.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_00
 You have to override it or something.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_00
 It wasn't on my pen.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_01
 Should we, by the way, draw...

0:34:30	SPEAKER_00
 What is going on?

0:34:31	SPEAKER_01
 On our nice whiteboard.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_01
 A little idea of the shape.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_01
 Probably.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_01
 Has anyone got...

0:34:41	SPEAKER_01
 A little bit detailed ideas about the shape?

0:34:44	SPEAKER_02
 I don't.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe like this pen.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_02
 A bit bigger, I guess.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, bigger.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_03
 A little bit bigger, yeah, but...

0:34:51	SPEAKER_01
 The shape is nice.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_01
 It's something different.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to want to feel more about that.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_00
 I have to say, I have this again opening remote control in my head most of the time.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_00
 Or I think some...

0:35:03	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we should...

0:35:04	SPEAKER_00
 No, that will be too.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, I think we should...

0:35:06	SPEAKER_00
 We could also...

0:35:07	SPEAKER_00
 That would also be an idea, but I don't think...

0:35:10	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if it exists already.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_00
 You should make a less-year-something design it.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_00
 That would also be nice.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_00
 But then you...

0:35:20	SPEAKER_00
 12 and a half euros.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but then you don't have...

0:35:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but it's not something that's in the production, because it's one time, you know?

0:35:27	SPEAKER_00
 It's a single cost.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_00
 But then you can...

0:35:31	SPEAKER_00
 Nah, I don't think it would be more expensive, because I bought the Alesi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_00
 It would be nice idea, though.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know, I think it has to be...

0:35:48	SPEAKER_00
 It has to have round forms or something.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_00
 Like something like that or something.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_01
 Something like that is very ergonomic.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_00
 And then a...

0:35:58	SPEAKER_00
 So?

0:35:59	SPEAKER_00
 And base unit underneath it is also round.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_00
 Put it in there, and it will wire on it.

0:36:06	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe...

0:36:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if some lights...

0:36:09	SPEAKER_00
 A big...

0:36:10	SPEAKER_00
 Well...

0:36:11	SPEAKER_00
 A flashlight at the...

0:36:13	SPEAKER_03
 A flashlight at the...

0:36:15	SPEAKER_00
 Four-human program.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_00
 A flashlight at the...

0:36:17	SPEAKER_01
 Four-human program should be there, I guess, because your hands...

0:36:19	SPEAKER_01
 And some of the extra functions will be in the smaller part.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_00
 Some of the extra functions over here.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_00
 And the numbers on top, I guess.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_00
 And in lights, maybe a ring of...

0:36:29	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, you have to recharge functions.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe on the side of it.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe round...

0:36:33	SPEAKER_00
 Around...

0:36:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, side of it.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_00
 On the side of it.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_01
 On the side of it.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe lights also around the four-human, the plus-minus program buttons.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but I also meant that the blinking light...

0:36:45	SPEAKER_00
 You know the ones that also blink when you try to locate your remote.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_03
 Well, probably at the side, you now look at the front.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_00
 When you see it from the side, it would look just like that.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_03
 And then there is...

0:37:06	SPEAKER_00
 It's triple for lights or something.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay, yeah.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_03
 Something like that, yeah.

0:37:11	SPEAKER_00
 Alright, I think it's nice for one thing.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe put something on top of it or you know, like this.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_00
 Looks funny.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_00
 Or some bump.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_01
 I think that'll be too big then.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_03
 Too big then.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_03
 Bumpers or something?

0:37:26	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I have to think about it.

0:37:27	SPEAKER_00
 I think we're done.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, we are.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_01
 I'm alright.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I guess it's lunch time.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_03
 Okay then.

0:37:34	None
 Mm-hmm.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_01
 Half an hour?

0:37:43	SPEAKER_01
 I thought our next individual round was half an hour.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I didn't know about a lunch break.

0:37:53	SPEAKER_03
 Well...

0:38:00	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, I missed it.

0:38:04	None
 I missed it.

0:38:07	None
 I missed it.

0:38:12	None
 I missed it.

0:38:19	None
 Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

0:38:22	None
 I missed it.

0:38:40	None
 I missed it.
