0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to go again.

0:00:25	SPEAKER_02
 My mouth is not working anymore.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_02
 Oh.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_02
 When I put it in, it's going to beep, beep, beep.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_01
 I got a nice little screen here over here.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_01
 I got like this big black border on every side.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_00
 Everybody ready?

0:00:49	SPEAKER_00
 I'll fix it.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, what I'm doing.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_00
 Functional design meeting.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_00
 Again, presented by Martin.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_00
 This is the agenda opening.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_00
 We've got three presentations and I'm going to show you some of the new project requirements that were sent to me and we're going to make a decision on remote control functions.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_00
 We have 40 minutes.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, this is the closing already.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_00
 So we'll start off with the first presentation then.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_00
 I think we have to do it in the right order.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe I don't know what the right order is.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_00
 Or that it won't.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we should start with the technical functions.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_02
 How can I get this on the?

0:01:39	SPEAKER_00
 You don't file in the project document folder.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_03
 You've already done that?

0:01:47	SPEAKER_00
 Well, let's close this one.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_00
 You think?

0:02:02	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_00
 I have to say something.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_00
 Due to some technical problems, I haven't digitized the last meeting minutes, but I'll make sure that happens next time.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_00
 I'll get this one in digital form too.

0:02:21	None
 Okay.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_02
 We're going to talk about the working design.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_02
 The method of the remote control is electrical energy.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_02
 It activates a chip in the remote.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_02
 It's an electrical circuit with composed messages in the form of infrared signals.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_02
 It's a device that can control the television.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_02
 It's a nowadays very known technology.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_02
 The known technology can make the cost very low.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_02
 It's a wide sale of remote controls in the world.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_02
 And the components are very cheap.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_02
 Diodes, better reason, let lights are needed and they're everywhere available against the fair price.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_02
 It's a common technology.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_02
 Like I told, the circuit board, it's the most important part of the device.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_02
 Remote control.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_02
 We can use for that fiberglass with copper wires.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_02
 It can be made as fast as printing paper.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_02
 It's all very...

0:03:53	SPEAKER_02
 They're making it all the time.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_02
 It's not very specialized technology.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_02
 I haven't come to here, but I've got some images of remote controls.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_02
 They were not very trendy or just remote control like everyone knows.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_02
 So I don't know why I should put it here.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_00
 It's a technical side of the remote control.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, but I haven't made it because of the time.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, let's skip that part.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_00
 But you don't think it's a problem to design a...

0:04:53	SPEAKER_00
 The technical part of the remote control is going to be easy.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_03
 Is there anything restricted for a user interface?

0:05:03	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_02
 It's just a part of a known technology.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_02
 Remote control is nothing special nowadays.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_00
 Regardless of what type of functions we want to implement.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_00
 Doesn't really matter.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think so because of all the televisions.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_02
 There are a few, maybe a couple of televisions with new functions.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_02
 Is it useful to put them on a standard remote?

0:05:35	SPEAKER_00
 We'll see later on.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the technical functions.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if you got the same pictures as I got.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_03
 I got these two.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_03
 I think we have to focus on one hand, the expert view or the novice user.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's very much depending on the user requirements.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know who is...

0:06:05	SPEAKER_00
 Well, there will be some user requirements later on.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's very important to what kind of functions we want to put in a remote control.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_00
 We'll keep this in mind and then discuss it later on.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we can put functions in it when we get the user requirements.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_03
 We can...

0:06:29	SPEAKER_00
 There's a big distinction between the style of a mouse.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_00
 We should choose one or we should not compromise but really choose for an expert view or a novice.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_00
 That's what you want to try and say.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_03
 Well, if you want to try a huge market, if you want to reach a huge market, like LDP people, we have to choose for novice user.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_03
 But I don't know.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_03
 It's really depending on how far the remote controls are already in...

0:07:03	SPEAKER_00
 Well, some of them...

0:07:05	SPEAKER_00
 It will be more clear when we come to some of the new requirements.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_03
 Well, there are at least basic functions, like just the channels of 1-9, ON and OFF, which must be clear with a red button or something like that.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_03
 Most standard volume, of course, and a mute function, and of course the next and previous ones, I think that's just basic what we need.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_03
 From that on, we can see at user requirements what we need more.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_03
 I thought Yosus was looking at the trends in the market.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_03
 And I don't know if there are any... if you put more functions, more buttons, maybe it's becoming less trendy or something like that.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_03
 I have really found the conclusion like that.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_03
 You can keep it in mind.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_03
 I thought with less buttons, you can make a more trendier design.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, more trendier design, I think.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_01
 Sounds interesting.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that's all I have to say.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_00
 Well, then the marketing expert can tell us something about the current market.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, because of that.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_01
 That's all right.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_01
 I've done some research for functional requirements.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_01
 The working method, there were 100 people, how do you say, watched using remote controls in the usability lab, and they also filled out a questionnaire with a few questions.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_01
 I've lined them up here.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_01
 I've had a lot of other common remote control looks good or not about willingness to spend money on remote control about sapping behavior.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_01
 And stuff like that.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_01
 I've found some interesting things.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_01
 We do got a market.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_01
 Three out of four people claim to find remote controls ugly.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_01
 So if you make a trendier design, we sure have 75% of the market, which you can reach.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_01
 Three out of four users, Zaps a lot, as I quoted here, from the results.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 Zaps buttons are used for 168 times per hour.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_01
 That's quite a lot.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_01
 Relevant options are, of course, power buttons, although only used once per hour.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_01
 Channel selection, volume, and buttons for text.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_01
 And the more other functions like audio settings, video settings, sound settings, are not said to be very important and very much used.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_01
 Furthermore, 50% says they only use 10% of the buttons on a remote control.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_01
 That doesn't say we can leave 90% off, but it sure says we shouldn't make it too complicated.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_01
 50% also claims to have lost remote control very often in the room.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_01
 An important thing here, the most important customers, which is over 70% of our market, is in the age range of 36 to 65 years old.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_01
 And elderly people, our market, are less interested in nice features, but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_01
 So, what I was thinking, wrong side, we shouldn't implement too much features on our remote control because elderly people will get lost, group features for higher usability, what I was claiming in the previous meeting.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_01
 All the settings about audio settings, video settings, and channel settings, which are not very often used, we could group them on one button, make them accessible in one menu button or whatever, because they are used very rarely.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_01
 Well, there are a lot of options there, so we can really make...

0:12:10	SPEAKER_01
 How do you say?

0:12:12	SPEAKER_01
 We can spare buttons over there.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_01
 And if you want to implement PCR and DVD options, group them in the button, not to... small buttons, so they won't be very...

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 How do you say?

0:12:30	SPEAKER_01
 Fishery presence.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, won't be very present, thank you.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_01
 And a trendy look, although 70% of the market is consists of elderly people who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_01
 I guess it can do no harm to make a trendy for the other 30%.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_01
 That was kind of what I found.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_00
 Well, then we... I'm going to show you some of the new project requirements, and then we're going to discuss on what features we find important.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_00
 Well, some of the new requirements make some of your findings quite irrelevant, I think, because...

0:13:20	SPEAKER_00
 I decided to put... they have to say to put two additional requirements forward.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I see four, this kind of strange.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_00
 Well, they say, data text becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I think that maybe so, but we can't just leave the data text button off.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_00
 No, I agree.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_00
 So, the compromise we could make is just to make one data text button, you know, like on and off, and don't make a lot of special...

0:13:50	SPEAKER_00
 Put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent, or, you know, it's just you want to be able to make use of data text, but not to play with it that much.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_00
 So, we have to think of that.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_00
 The remote control should only be used for the television, otherwise the project becomes more complex, which in danger is the time to market.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_00
 So, maybe we should leave all DVD and VCR-related features off completely.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know, I think that's what they're trying to say.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_00
 Our current customers are within the age group of 40 plus.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_00
 New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than 40.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_00
 So, you talked about elderly, where we're willing to spend more on the remote control, and we're interested.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_00
 But, well, they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger...

0:14:41	SPEAKER_01
 I don't really agree, actually, to be honest.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_01
 It's a very small market, which we will approach then, if we want to reach customers younger than 40.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_01
 It's only like 30% of the total market.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but it's the fact that the bigger market you're talking about, we already covered it.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_00
 Our company already sells remote control to older people, but we also want a new customer group.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_00
 That's the one we haven't covered yet.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_00
 So, I think that's what the problem is.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_00
 We haven't got remote controls for it.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can compromise a little bit.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think so.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe not too much then, but...

0:15:20	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_00
 I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group, but isn't that bad for a older person either.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_00
 Our corporate image should stay recognizable in our product.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_00
 Our product, corporate color and slogan must be implemented in a new design.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, something nice to know.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_03
 What's our slogan?

0:15:45	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry?

0:15:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we have to look that up.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'll have a look.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_00
 We think it's something about electronics.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_00
 I thought it might be, let's make things better or something.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_00
 Sensitivity.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well, let's go back to the...

0:16:06	SPEAKER_00
...gen now.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_00
 So, if now the three presentations, we know about the new project requirements.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_00
 That means we can discuss under remote control functions.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if I can make a start, I think it's coming more clear what kind of remote control is going to be.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_00
 And I already talked about maybe you're familiar with the remote control that has the can opener underneath it.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_00
 I think we're looking for some...

0:16:36	SPEAKER_00
 We're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic DV functions.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_01
 Well, to be honest, if our aim group is still 40, not older than 40, maybe that's not very...

0:16:52	SPEAKER_01
...we don't really need to have a simple remote control.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_01
 I think we can implement more functions then because basically the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology and therefore will be a more...

0:17:08	SPEAKER_00
 That's why a lot of the use of the requirements, the account managers send me, I think they are contradicting each other because they want a simpler design and no other functions in just TV, but they do aim at the younger...

0:17:24	SPEAKER_03
 You said that a lot of functions aren't used.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_03
 So, why should we put a function in?

0:17:31	SPEAKER_03
 I think younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than more functions.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_00
 I think we can make some discussions in the functions.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_00
 You have different kind of equipment in your room, like a TV and a DVD player.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_00
 You can put very detailed functions regarding the TV set on your remote control with audio settings and screen settings.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_00
 We don't want that. I think that was... that became clear.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_00
 But maybe we should put some... I know that the younger people, most likely, have a DVD player they want to...

0:18:16	SPEAKER_03
 Control. Yeah, but the functions are not in the remote control we are making.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_00
 No, the user requirements of the new project requirements still are not too...

0:18:30	SPEAKER_00
 But maybe we should put some functions for other equipment on it, but just the basic functions maybe like wind and wind or...

0:18:43	SPEAKER_02
 What you can put on that. Yeah.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_01
 Or we could put them behind the flip flap or whatever.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_00
 But what do you think? Should we implement the features that are functions that control other devices?

0:19:00	SPEAKER_00
 No, you don't think so.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_00
 No, the new requirements.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, the new requirements say so.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_02
 But you can put a play and stop and...

0:19:07	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it's... There is something... Most of the time, these functions don't support the particular device as well as their own remote control.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_00
 You know, a lot of DVD players have some tricky settings.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, if it's too simple, they won't use the remote control they use their own.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_01
 But for example, a VCR, that's a better example in this case.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_01
 I think on a remote control for television, you don't need to be able to program the VCR.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_01
 You start recording at 3PM or whatever.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_01
 Just play, stop, rewind and fast forward.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but we have to think DVD.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I know, but...

0:19:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, so from my experience, it's kind of...

0:19:48	SPEAKER_00
 A lot of DVD players, you know, like forwarding goes differently.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_00
 You could do two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_00
 Sometimes a bit difficult.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe if we just leave the DVD function out.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I wasn't thinking about putting it in, but concerning the project requirements and what you just said, I think...

0:20:05	SPEAKER_00
 I should focus on a TV then.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_03
 Keep it simple.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_03
 And look more at it.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_00
 And it's just a complementary remote, not a universal one.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_00
 If you want to keep it simple, you can make a universal remote.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_00
 It's only for television, though.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_00
 It should be something that is like gadget on your coffee table.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_00
 And it's just when when you jump on the couch, you pick up the nice remote, the simple one, just put on the television, nothing more.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_00
 Nothing more.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_02
 But I will be able to handle a whole market.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_02
 There are dozens of remote controls.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we'll make this one trendy.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's simple.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_00
 We will come to that.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_00
 But first, on the functions.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_00
 So we should put ZEP buttons on it.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_00
 Also numbers to go to this specific channel.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, definitely.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_03
 It's too much integrated.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, a Dellitex button should be there, but just one big Dellitex button on and off.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, maybe two or three other options, but nothing more than that.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_01
 I think stop function is very useful.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_01
 If you have a page with consists of more pages, and you are not a very quick reader, then I think it's very irritating.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but the next page comes to difficult.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_00
 It's not a very common function.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_00
 And people have to read up on the remote.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_01
 I use it quite often.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, maybe you do, but I've never heard of it in the first place.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_00
 We have to, well, set the market.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and Dellitex is becoming outdated.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_00
 We just want to see what programs are on and what time it is probably.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's kind of getting too complex for our mind.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know what you guys think.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's in the eye.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_03
 But I always use it for the sucker.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_00
 But do you like to have such a stop button?

0:22:00	SPEAKER_00
 Do you think it is a kind of a very rare and special function?

0:22:07	SPEAKER_03
 For example, a couple of weeks ago, I looked at the four flights.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_03
 And there are a lot of flights in one page.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_00
 But that kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_02
 You could have it on the set and use it on the new environment.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_02
 On the set buttons, you can put it to access all the same pages.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_02
 Well, yeah, if you have a bunch of new televisions, you can store pages.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_00
 And you can just keep manually through them using it.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_00
 I think we just want the Dellitex button on it.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_00
 Then we meet the newer climates.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_00
 We also meet the other thing.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_00
 We have to choose for the simple design, I guess.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_00
 What functions do we have to decide on?

0:22:57	SPEAKER_00
 Or do we, I don't know, if we have to specifically name all the functions we want?

0:23:04	SPEAKER_00
 We have to zip under the volume.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_00
 Should we make them very big in the zip button?

0:23:10	SPEAKER_00
 I think the plus and the minus button.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_00
 That should be considered to be quite impressive.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_00
 Or maybe you should place them on a special way.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe you could make it kind of a joystick.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, something or something special way to zip through the...

0:23:25	SPEAKER_00
 It has to be...

0:23:27	SPEAKER_00
 Or it's in a hole.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, in a quick, you have to use it very quickly.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_01
 If you grab the remote, your hands should be on top of the plus button.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, the buttons should make it possible to zip through your channels in the rapid pace.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, what should we decide on then?

0:23:50	SPEAKER_00
 I think in the case of this simple remote control, the technical aspects which weren't worked out already, but it shouldn't be a problem then.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_02
 No, it's just signals.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe in the television, does the rest.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_00
 No, okay, but we don't have to...

0:24:07	SPEAKER_00
 When we don't want to control other devices, I think it makes it even more simple.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe the batteries maybe.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_03
 If we use large batteries or small batteries.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's standard batteries.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_00
 I think it would be...

0:24:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, not the watch kind of...

0:24:25	SPEAKER_00
 The most...

0:24:26	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it has to be simple when the most ordinary...

0:24:29	SPEAKER_00
 Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_00
 Wow, how much time do we have left?

0:24:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think about 20 minutes.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_02
 But in a way, we have to be special.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, okay.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_00
 Have you ever thought about that?

0:24:51	SPEAKER_00
 How we can...

0:24:53	SPEAKER_00
 What the extra touch can be?

0:24:54	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe just the design or the shape or some gadget kind of future?

0:24:59	SPEAKER_00
 What's something about how we lose them?

0:25:02	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it should be remote control when you clip your hands.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_00
 It makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's more for an H range of 10 to 12 for whatever.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_00
 Now, a lot of people like to have such kind of gate kind of things.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_00
 It should be like a birthday present or something that you get someone in.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_00
 That's a good one.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_00
 Or maybe you should have a big light that can flash or something on it.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_00
 Or maybe it should...

0:25:33	SPEAKER_00
 Or the light that it can open it.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_00
 It contains some future that you don't normally link to a remote control.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's very important because we're going to make such a basic remote control.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_00
 We have to do something to make it special.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_00
 It's going to cost 25 euros.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_01
 I think the Ken Alperer is a brilliant idea, actually, because...

0:25:52	SPEAKER_01
 But the television and VR is not a rare combination.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_00
 And I think it's going to be very...

0:26:00	SPEAKER_00
 It has to be sturdy or something.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe with bouncing bats, so that you can just throw it on the floor or something.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_00
 It has to be something special.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_00
 It has to...

0:26:13	SPEAKER_00
 People when they buy it, they have to think about this one less for a long time.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_00
 We're really going to use it and not something you throw away next week.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe that's...

0:26:23	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's...

0:26:24	SPEAKER_00
 When we decide on these type of functions, basic functions, it's very important to find something like that.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_00
 So it's a very important task for you.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can all think about it.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, also for you.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe when you...

0:26:37	SPEAKER_00
 It's very nice when you can be trendy as an...

0:26:41	SPEAKER_00
 A friend who's friendly as well, you know?

0:26:43	SPEAKER_00
 Big buttons, flashy design.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_00
 And maybe some kind of gauges kind of thing.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_00
 Swappable front or whatever.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_00
 Or just different colors would be...

0:26:56	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if people also want to spend more money on fronts for their...

0:26:59	SPEAKER_00
 You know, you never know.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_00
 Why not?

0:27:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_03
 More money for us.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_00
 And I think we have to make it quite big.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_00
 Quite big?

0:27:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, definitely.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_03
 Definitely.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_02
 So it's also because it's expensive.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_02
 If you wanted to be something, you know?

0:27:15	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't have much function.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_00
 You don't want to be...

0:27:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, you don't want to get it.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_00
 It should be visible nearly anywhere in the room.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_01
 As I said during my presentation, 50 percent...

0:27:25	SPEAKER_01
 And it should not look nice when you put it on a tape.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_00
 I think you might want to put it...

0:27:32	SPEAKER_00
 Standard.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it stands up.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_00
 You have to put it on its...

0:27:37	SPEAKER_00
 So it's like a vase or something you put on a tape.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_00
 A vase.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if you...

0:27:41	SPEAKER_00
 More like a statue.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_00
 It's like a statue or something.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I see what it's like.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so for phones.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but you also can put it somewhere...

0:27:49	SPEAKER_01
 If you do that, but I don't know if that's possible within the production costs of 12.5 euros.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_01
 In the base, we could like make a button and if you push it, the remote control itself makes noise.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_01
 That's probably stupid, but as I found here...

0:28:09	SPEAKER_01
 50 percent?

0:28:10	SPEAKER_01
 Was it 50?

0:28:11	SPEAKER_01
 That's one of the first times.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_01
 50 percent often loses the remote control.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but when it gets lost, how can you press the button to make it...

0:28:21	SPEAKER_01
 No, off the base.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, okay.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_01
 The thing you put it in.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, man.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_01
 It's kind of nice.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_01
 A button in there.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_00
 And then also you don't even need batteries because you can make it chargeable.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you can make rechargeable one, yeah.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_00
 Why not?

0:28:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but...

0:28:38	SPEAKER_00
 Not what I think it might be.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_00
 Why not?

0:28:40	SPEAKER_00
 We don't...

0:28:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, maybe you...

0:28:43	SPEAKER_00
 But we don't know much about production costs, but when you can imagine that when you spend 25 euros on a remote control...

0:28:49	SPEAKER_00
 And it's basically a remote control, and then the money...

0:28:52	SPEAKER_00
 There must be money to spend on that kind of rechargeable...

0:28:56	SPEAKER_01
 It should only cost 12.5 euros, of course.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but we do it in Taiwan, and so it's not going to be that.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a great idea.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's a good idea.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_00
 So kind of...

0:29:11	SPEAKER_00
 I've never seen that before.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_00
 You see it with the...

0:29:14	SPEAKER_00
 The mouse's now.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, definitely.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, but it's at handy.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_00
 Well, you can recharge it, so you never have the battery problem.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_00
 It's a good idea.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_00
 That's one thing.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_00
 And you can always find more...

0:29:27	SPEAKER_00
 You can have a remote control.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_02
 You can have a remote control nowadays.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_02
 Can last two years, three years, with two batteries.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_00
 Well, maybe, yeah, you could...

0:29:36	SPEAKER_00
 And then...

0:29:37	SPEAKER_00
 When it's too costly, you could probably skip the recharge.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_00
 But you do need...

0:29:42	SPEAKER_00
 Also, you would need a battery in the base unit as well, you know?

0:29:47	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you could connect that to 220 volts, of course.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but that's not...

0:29:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but then it's very easy to make it also rechargeable.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think that is going to cost much to make it also rechargeable.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_00
 Function.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_01
 On the other hand, if you don't do it, we can also make a nice bay.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it looks trendy.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_01
 And still put the bleep function in it.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_01
 But...

0:30:10	SPEAKER_01
 I think the bay is definitely...

0:30:13	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's a good idea and make it...

0:30:15	SPEAKER_00
 You know, we...

0:30:18	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it isn't the most costly remote control.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_00
 We can save on the functions.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_00
 We just put some simple buttons and make it big and sturdy, nothing more.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_00
 And just make sure there are some noise that it can make, or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_00
 Sure, why not?

0:30:37	SPEAKER_00
 It's also nice.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_00
 And then you put...

0:30:39	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's...

0:30:41	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we have to...

0:30:43	SPEAKER_00
 It's an easy market. We have to do something special.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_00
 And for 25 euros people want something special from your remote control.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_00
 And we can deliver that in regards to functions because we aren't going to...

0:30:55	SPEAKER_01
 With eye candy, ear candy, whatever.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, definitely.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_00
 And then you make it, you know, nice looking shape.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_00
 And then also you got to stand up thing.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a good idea.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_03
 It must be a gadget to have.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, definitely.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if it... Well, we'll see what's possible concerning the costs.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_00
 And if it's possible, we'll do that.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_00
 And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_00
 And the first thing we...

0:31:22	SPEAKER_00
 Most likely thing to skip is the probably to reach our function or something.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_00
 If that's too expensive, we won't do that.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_00
 But it would be nice.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_00
 It would be nice, yeah.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's the idea.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_00
 I know the batteries last long nowadays.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_00
 And what people just think about, oh, I'll never have to buy any batteries again.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_00
 Because it's very annoying when your battery is empty.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_00
 You know, when you have any batteries around, and probably for two weeks...

0:31:46	SPEAKER_01
 Most television is break down before the battery pack is empty.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:31:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_00
 So easy functions, well, I think we'll work that out, sapping numbers on it.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_03
 Or just if it beep when the battery is down.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, why not?

0:32:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_00
 But it's also annoying.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_00
 Because as long as it keeps working, you're not very motivated to do something about it.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_00
 Now that's the soul of time and everything.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_00
 You don't want to ever have those problems.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_00
 And you won't have...

0:32:17	SPEAKER_00
 If you have to rechargeable...

0:32:19	SPEAKER_00
 And you don't have to use the unit.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_00
 You can also put it on the side if people don't like it.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_00
 Why not?

0:32:24	SPEAKER_00
 But you pay for it.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but I mean, if they pay for it because they think, oh, that's a great idea.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to use it.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_00
 And when time goes by and they think, oh, I never put them in a recharge.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_00
 I think last long enough, then they put it on the side and they can use it now and then.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_00
 And when they look...

0:32:41	SPEAKER_00
 No, for sure, everybody who buys this remote control, winning a couple of months, they will be in the situation that they're seeking for their remote control.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_00
 They want to see something quick and they just push the button and they...

0:32:51	SPEAKER_00
 Bleep, bleep, all their aridates.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_00
 I've never...

0:32:55	SPEAKER_00
 It's so simple, but I've never seen it.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_03
 I think we need to adjust there.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we should really...

0:32:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well, how much time have you got left?

0:33:06	SPEAKER_00
 These clocks are untouched.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_00
 I think.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_00
 Well, ladies and gentlemen.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, hello.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so we have 10 minutes or something?

0:33:13	SPEAKER_01
 Something like that.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but we're done.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_00
 I think.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_03
 Give me a minute.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_00
 We've decided on the functions.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_00
 Well, there's some...

0:33:23	SPEAKER_00
 There is a closing sheet.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_00
 We have lunch break, then we have 30 minutes of individual work.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, I'll make sure...

0:33:34	SPEAKER_00
 I had some problems with digitizing the first minutes.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_00
 The next minutes won't be a problem, but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too, but maybe it won't work, but you'll see.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_00
 I think these are more important than the first ones.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_03
 Can you make a part of the folder for the minutes?

0:33:55	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, 15 minutes.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_00
 15 minutes.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_00
 15 minutes.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, five minutes.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because I did the first minutes I did, where it was scratchy, you know.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_00
 Then I did a second one with a nicer layout, which I could use for the other ones as well.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_00
 But I think I forgot to put it under the first one.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_00
 When you go right a second, it's not working when you try to...

0:34:19	SPEAKER_00
 Second paper or something.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_00
 You have to override it or something.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_00
 It wasn't on my pen.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_01
 Should we, by the way, draw...

0:34:30	SPEAKER_00
 What is going on?

0:34:31	SPEAKER_01
 It's a whiteboard, a little idea of the shape.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_01
 Has anyone got...

0:34:42	SPEAKER_01
 A little bit detailed ideas about the shape?

0:34:45	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe like this pen.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_02
 A bit bigger, I guess.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_03
 A little bit bigger, yeah, but...

0:34:52	SPEAKER_01
 The shape is nice.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_01
 It's something different.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_00
 I have to say I have this can opening remote control in my head most of the time.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_00
 Or I think maybe we should...

0:35:05	SPEAKER_00
 No, that will be too.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_00
 We should...

0:35:07	SPEAKER_00
 We could also...

0:35:08	SPEAKER_00
 It would also be an idea.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_00
 But I don't think...

0:35:10	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if it exists already.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_00
 You should like make a less year or something design it.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_00
 It would also be nice.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_00
 But then you...

0:35:20	SPEAKER_00
 12 and a half euros.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but then you don't have...

0:35:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but it's not something...

0:35:25	SPEAKER_00
 It's in the production because it's one time...

0:35:28	SPEAKER_00
 It's a single cost.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_00
 But then you can...

0:35:32	SPEAKER_00
 No, I don't think...

0:35:33	SPEAKER_00
 I think it would be more expensive.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_00
 Because I've bought the lessy stuff more often and even...

0:35:39	SPEAKER_00
 Small pencil holders or something are more expensive.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_00
 It would be nice idea, though.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_00
 I think it has to be...

0:35:49	SPEAKER_00
 It has to have round forms or something.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_00
 Like something like that or something.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_01
 Something like that is very ergonomic.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_01
 And then...

0:35:58	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:35:59	SPEAKER_00
 And base unit underneath it.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_00
 It's also round.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_00
 Put it in there.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_00
 Why are you on it?

0:36:07	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe...

0:36:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_00
 Some lights...

0:36:11	SPEAKER_00
 Big...

0:36:12	None
 Well...

0:36:13	SPEAKER_03
 It's flashlights.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_03
 For you, man.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_00
 It's flashlights.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_01
 It's flashlights.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_01
 For you, man, program should be there, I guess, because...

0:36:20	SPEAKER_00
 And some of the extra functions...

0:36:21	SPEAKER_01
 Your hands will be in the smaller part.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_00
 Some of the extra functions over here.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_00
 And the numbers on top, I guess.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_00
 And in lights, maybe a ring of...

0:36:29	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, you have to...

0:36:30	SPEAKER_00
 A wrist charge function.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe on the side of...

0:36:33	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe a round...

0:36:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, a side of the...

0:36:35	SPEAKER_00
 A little bit of a left strip on the...

0:36:37	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe lights also around the...

0:36:39	SPEAKER_01
 For you, man, the plus minus program buttons.

0:36:42	None
 Yeah.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_00
 But I also meant that the blinking light...

0:36:45	SPEAKER_00
 You know, the ones that also blink when you try to...

0:36:48	SPEAKER_00
 Locate your remote.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_01
 Well...

0:36:53	SPEAKER_03
 Probably at the side...

0:36:56	SPEAKER_03
 You're not looking at the front.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_00
 When you see it from the side...

0:37:02	SPEAKER_00
 And it would look just like that.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_03
 And then you have...

0:37:06	SPEAKER_03
 And then there is...

0:37:07	SPEAKER_00
 It's a strip of lights for some kind of...

0:37:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_03
 Something like that, yeah.

0:37:12	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I think it's nice for one thing.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe put something on top of it or you know, like that...

0:37:17	SPEAKER_00
 That looks funny.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_00
 Or some bomb.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_01
 I think that'll be too big then.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_03
 Too big then.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_03
 Bumpers or something?

0:37:26	SPEAKER_00
 Well, let's think about it.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_00
 I think we're done.

0:37:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, we are.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_01
 I'm the right one.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I guess it's lunch time.

0:37:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, then.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_00
 How long do we have to leave, huh?

0:37:41	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:37:42	SPEAKER_01
 Half an hour?

0:37:43	SPEAKER_01
 I thought our next...

0:37:46	SPEAKER_01
 Next individual round was half an hour.

0:37:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that was...

0:37:50	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know about the lunch break.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if I can find it.

0:38:20	None
 Whoo.
