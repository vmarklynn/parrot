0:00:00	None
 Reid?

0:00:09	None
 some Ioddy Okay.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_02
 Alright.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:01:04	None
 Alright.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_02
 Is everyone here?

0:01:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yep.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_02
 This is our conceptual design meeting.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_02
 I'll just take a few minutes and go through the previous minutes.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_02
 Then each of you will have your presentation.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_02
 And then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_02
 And then we'll have 40 minutes for finishing up.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_02
 And then we'll go through the minutes first.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_02
 We just refreshed our goal of making the finest remote control available.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_02
 We decided that we know that we need to use company colors, company logo.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_02
 And our marketing expert gave us some information from interviews with 100 different remote users with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_02
 People thought the remotes were ugly.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_02
 That remotes zap a lot.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_02
 They only use a finite amount of buttons.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_02
 And that they often lose, that's easy to lose remote.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_02
 Which we're all things we were thinking we would want to make it simple.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_02
 And some sort of locator, a button or tracking device.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_02
 And that it should look different than what's out there.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_02
 Kind of mixed response on the speech recognition.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_02
 The younger people said they wanted it, the older people did not.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_02
 I think we decided that the expense was not necessarily worth it.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_02
 And that it was probably a gimmick that would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_02
 Then the user interface designer explored some of the technical functions of the remote.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_02
 The simple versus the complex, the simple one being better for a user, the complex better for an engineer.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_02
 And some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user oriented remote, something simple.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_02
 And that we didn't want to go with a universal remote because increasing cost and increasing complexity.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_02
 We would just have a TV remote.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_02
 And that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote, have it be something that looks different.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_02
 And finally, our industrial designer gave us a rundown of how the remote will work from energy source, what we would use batteries because we don't want to have a cable.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_02
 How that would power the remote and the lamp.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_02
 If we were to have one, the user interface then would connect to a chip, which would work with the infrared controls to send the signal to the TV.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_02
 I believe then we came up with a couple ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_02
 And we're going to be able to get into easily into someone's hand and with a just a few buttons, just the basics and with a scrolling function.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_02
 We're going to be able to get that marketing, we're watching trends.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so I was looking at trend watching.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_01
 Unfortunately, I wasn't given too much information.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_01
 I was given a brief executive summary and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_01
 And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, the most important finding was that the fancy look and feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look and feel design, which I think we kind of already discussed before.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_01
 The second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_01
 And again, these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own, but this just backs it up.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_01
 And thirdly, the remote should be easy to use.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_01
 As far as fashion update, we have learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths, shoes and furniture.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_01
 And that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote, but we can try. And also, as opposed to last year, this year, the material is expected to be spongy and feel.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so from that, as we've already said, we need to focus on a fancy look and feel.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_01
 I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design, but I think that even if it's very subtle, we need to kind of trick our consumers so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and similar to the shape or the colors or all of that.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_01
 And so, we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 So, I guess the two options are if we had a remote in the shape of the fruit or natural.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_01
 Or with exterior designs, but my question is, I mean, stereotypically speaking, you kind of picture males with their remote controls, and I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside, so maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable or, I don't know, different options for female male target and then the spongy feel.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_01
 I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there and look at different types of material that might please our users.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_01
 What's spongy feeling? Remote controls.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_01
 What's that?

0:09:46	SPEAKER_02
 Possibly, sorry, just a button for a second, possibly a cover like the head for mobile phones.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_02
 One with a flag and one with a banana and one that's a spongy feel to it.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_02
 We could leave that to the cover department.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_00
 So they've got nothing to do all day.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_00
 I talked about the interface concept and how the customer relates to the consumer use the actual device.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_00
 So I've looked at some of the stuff I've sent, try and get some inspiration, but keep in mind that our own ideas that we had.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_00
 I was sent some information from the company saying that the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology where you could program questions into such devices.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_00
 They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question, you program the answer, and the machine responds accordingly.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_00
 There's different ways of a user can use products like remote.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_00
 There's a graphical use where you look at pictures and on a screen.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_00
 A command line where you obviously type things in and you get a response.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_00
 That's just to point out the inconsistent interface in remote.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_00
 So they had a look at new products that are on the market, not necessarily remote controls, but ones that you recognize.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_00
 This is the voice recognition and remote control which can control multiple devices, the service-based channels with your voice.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's all 80 speech samples, controls for devices, TV, cable satellite, VCR, DVD and audio.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_00
 You can record your own verbal labels that are connected to remote control functions.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_00
 The one on the left is very similar to what we drew upon the board in the previous meeting, where it has scroll down functions on the side, you can sort of just make those out.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_00
 And then on the right is obviously an iPod, which is possible, the simplest thing to use out there.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_00
 And all that is is just a nice big scroll menu that you sort of go through.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_00
 That is a possibility and nothing simple really.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_00
 Then there's things like this, which is a kid's remote, where the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_00
 So, the remote control only allows them to access the channels that the parents want them to watch, and it means that children have a novelty of having their own remote control.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_00
 So, I don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote control.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_00
 We just had two components, maybe we could have more components, you know, different than those.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_00
 The point made at the end there is that you just have to sort of be clear on your devices as to what, you know, things you use sometimes.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_00
 An arrow pointing down, which may suggest volume down, could be completely used just as a V for volume, just little things like that, which would need to be made clear in the design.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_00
 I think you can't afford what you said, and usually friendly remote with minimum buttons, maybe we've sort of suggested this two part thing, where if it was to have a speech recognition thing, maybe control that on the program or that on the control bit, and then just have the simple sort of handheld thing that we sort of devised earlier as the actual remote.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_00
 It could be a graphical display, the actual remote control port, maybe could have like an iPod, we just sort of control through the menus, stuff like, it gets more and more complicated, and then the handheld bit should be ergonomic and designed.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_00
 And that is it.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_00
 Just, just a song show you.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_00
 And this is a limb got things like that, huge things, which is, that's one.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_00
 19 year old, ground of my eye.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_00
 Industrial design.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, cream stuff like that.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_02
 I noticed the giant dog bone shape.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_02
 Also good for animals.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_00
 Well, let's see.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_03
 Just to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there, and that we do have to fit the stuff in there.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_03
 I have more information on possible materials as well, what we can and cannot do.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_03
 Just wait for this to load up and I'll show you.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_03
 What we're talking about here.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_03
 The details of the components design, as you can see there, what we have is the board, the main board of the remote control, the underside.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_03
 It's a pretty cheap piece of technology.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_03
 You can see the chip, which is the device to recognize the signals, the input, and it passes it on to a row of the transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplified the signal, which later on.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_03
 This is the transfer to an infrared lamp, which then, of course, shines infrared light onto the television terminal, recognize what signal it's getting and what you tell it.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_03
 So much for the workings of the remote control itself, its job is to wait for you to press a key, then to translate that key press into infrared light signals that are received by the television.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_03
 When you press the key, you complete a specific connection, the chip senses the connection, knows what button you press, that produces a Morse code line signal specific to that button.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_03
 You can see the input and the signal, which is the signal, is the signal to the signal, which translates the signal to the infrared light, the sensor in the TV, you can see the infrared light, and seeing the signal reacts appropriately.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_03
 The green greenish board is what we saw in the first slide just flipped over. You can see the circuit board itself, it's the cheapest way to make electronic connections basically on the market.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_03
 If you do, as you don't have cables, but you have the connections actually in these lines on the board. These are the actual keys that are being pressed to close the electric circuit that then sends the signal to the chip on the other side that will be behind here, which sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff, amplified the signal and all that has been sent to the infrared lamp up there.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_03
 Now, you can see this is the rubber button version of it, the way it works instead, the keys here, the rubber button has a little metal plate on the other side, which closes the circuit here, and thus gives on the signal. Now, this is the simple version.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_03
 We are talking, this is the simple and cheapest version at the same time. We're talking something more complicated, of course, it's going to be more expensive as well.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_03
 I'll tell me that. We also restricted the use of our outer shell or in the material that we could use for our outer shell. I've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic, rubber as well, rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_03
 It's pretty squishy that would serve that purpose. We could also use wood or titanium.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_02
 What's the approximate cost per 100,000 for the titanium?

0:20:30	SPEAKER_03
 I don't have an information on that. However, our company obviously can provide us with the titanium. I was given an OK to use it. It certainly is an expensive material. I'm aware of that.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_03
 I was given an OK, but there are certain restrictions to certain materials. Now, let's first go through the list with materials. What we can use is plastic, rubber, wood, and titanium.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_03
 We can mix these as for the energy source. We're talking about that shortly in the meeting. What we could use is what I was offered, what we could use as a basic battery.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_03
 Interestingly enough, we could use solar cells or a device that was not further specified that provides kinetic energy, such as watches.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_03
 We could just move them, move the actual device and provide some energy. Obviously, I personally have to say that the dynamo is out of question.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_03
 You don't want to wind up your remote control before you can use it.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_03
 Solar cell is interesting. May fail, though, every time they're. Yeah, or you do use it, advice behind the couch for a weekend.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_03
 Works well in Arizona, but not so.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_03
 The kinetic energy thing might work, but same problem. You leave it lying around. First, I have to shake it before it starts to work.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_03
 So I'd say what we're stuck with really is the basic battery, which also makes a base station basically obsolete.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_03
 Our interface options are push buttons in which in the production of which an official which company is expert.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_03
 However, we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option and they are possible. We have an okay for scroll wheels.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_03
 However, when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod, I have one big objection and that is that we have to fit an LCD into the remote control as well.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_03
 This however may exclude certain materials.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_03
 We have a squishy kind of remote control and LCD screen may be affected by the movement, so we might not be able to put it in there.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_03
 There's also restrictions to when it comes to the chip. If we have a more sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic setup that we've just presented, the chip has to be more sophisticated and that's more expensive as well.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_03
 I don't have any details to the cost but it will be significant difference. I'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore that's how it's more sophisticated chip but that's not up to me to decide really.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_03
 So that's for the scroll wheel. It limits our choice and squishy is hip so I'd say, rather not go for that. Let's see now.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_03
 Solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex surface or remote control but obviously that's not a problem since we have decided against solar cells I assume right?

0:24:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, anybody still? Yeah, I think batteries are probably the way to go.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_03
 With the titanium we cannot make it a curved design, just be able to make it flat and straight design pretty much which I assume would exclude.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_00
 With the sort of spongy and plastic thing you can get those mobile phones and initially have a is plastic but then they have sort of a cover on it which is just sort of soft stuff.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_00
 So I don't know if that will still be possible to have it open in plastic but then whether people hold it still be sort of spongy.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_01
 And we can have the fruits and vegetables on this one too far until we can remove it.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_00
 So was it a possibility of having a graphical display on it like a screen?

0:26:17	SPEAKER_03
 I can have an LCD screen but therefore no rubber will be used.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_03
 So the plastic is titanium, yes but this will of course influence the form of plastic as I understand it.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_03
 And titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form. So the way to go is if you want to scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular, add an LCD screen and then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_03
 If you want to make it a particular shape use plastic and the LCD screen add a scroll wheel that will be fine or make it just put buttons.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_03
 Basically plastic gives you the biggest variety of options, maybe not the nicest feel, not much of the analogy.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_03
 So the rubbery we can shape it however we want, for the rubbery we cannot.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_03
 With the rubbery we could pretty much shape it the way we wanted it but we cannot add swirl wheels and we cannot add an LCD screen.

0:27:40	None
 That's the tricky thing.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_00
 Could we not have a shape with a scroll on the screen and then the initial shape we had which is sort of banana esque.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_00
 That's the whoever thing we did it yellow and you just stick on just some other things and that's not a quick from it.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_00
 They wouldn't have any, they're just on the exterior, they wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_02
 Is that an option, a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on a certain spot?

0:28:22	SPEAKER_03
 Certainly can be done.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_03
 That doesn't affect the functional side of it all.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_03
 Like say just the underside of it can be done.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_03
 I assume.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_03
 So the fruit design, how about affecting the surface of the actual remote control.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_03
 Say we don't make it the particular fruit shape obviously but a good surface of an orange banana whatever you name it.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_02
 What about a smell?

0:29:18	SPEAKER_02
 It's the remote.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_00
 You could just sell it in different colours as well.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_00
 Great.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_00
 We're supposed to stick to the company cost.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yellow and grey.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_03
 So what have we lemon banana?

0:29:38	SPEAKER_03
 Grapefruit.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_03
 Grapefruit is what we go for in terms of the author appearance perhaps.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_02
 I would say if I were to make a decision I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower end of the spectrum of importance.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_01
 I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_03
 Well we haven't been out of it already.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_02
 Perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lower that fruit minded.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_00
 It's yellow.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_00
 It's curved.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_03
 So why not add a couple of grey stripes?

0:30:32	SPEAKER_02
 Couple of grey stripes.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_02
 We could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that person could turn it over.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_02
 The grey stripes would look like a banana just sitting on their table.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_00
 And then you could actually put the banana shape thing on the fruit bowl on the coffee table.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe the holder.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_02
 If we were to have a holder it could be shaped like a fruit bowl.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_02
 It could be an ape or a fruit bowl.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_02
 Do you have more to your presentation?

0:31:14	SPEAKER_03
 That's pretty much it.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_03
 I've been informed about the materials.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_03
 What the materials are.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to plug in here real quick.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_02
 Like I said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_01
 So is the two piece idea out or will we not decide it?

0:31:58	SPEAKER_00
 We sort of might want to look at that because if we're going to use a battery then the base station might not be necessary.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_03
 We can still design a two piece remote without having one of them be a base station but just have it be an optional big remote with lots of functions or you take out a smaller piece.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_03
 We can still do that.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_03
 However of course it would be like designing two remotes.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_03
 Which then design would probably limit the limit again to use of certain materials because they would be too expensive.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_03
 They like a scroll wheel and on both of them or have an LCD screen and so on.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_03
 You'd probably have to stick rather with a traditional rubber button design which we saw there.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_02
 Could be done.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_02
 So these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_02
 For our components concept we need to come up with the energy source chip on print and the case.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_02
 Probably case material and probably a shape also.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_02
 And then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the type is and what kind of supplements will have.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_02
 Energy source I think we've decided batteries although not exciting are probably our best bet.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_03
 We have five minutes.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_03
 The more advanced features you want the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_02
 So I guess we should pick the case then.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_02
 Then the chip on print is still kind of we could have either or we could have a complex one or a non complex.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_01
 But did we decide that the rubbery feel is important enough to us.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_02
 Okay so we would have the LCD screen.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_02
 So I guess the case would be plastic with.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_02
 Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_01
 It's more of a supplement maybe.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_01
 So we're going to go to the scroll are we going for the iPad type.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_02
 Which will require a more expensive chip on print right.

0:36:02	None
 But I guess that is that about it.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_02
 So we have a good idea of what we're going to need to do on this.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_02
 So we will have another meeting in 30 minutes.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_02
 Here's what's going to be going on.

0:37:11	SPEAKER_02
 Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_02
 And you'll be working on the look and feel design.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_02
 Corinne will want a product evaluation.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_02
 And the two of you get to play with the modeling components and maybe get us a prototype.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_02
 It should go along well with your look and feel design and your interface.

0:37:49	SPEAKER_02
 So that basically will just be working on the prototype.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_02
 We'll accomplish your other two actions.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_02
 All right.
