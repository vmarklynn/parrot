0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, we're all set.

0:00:05	SPEAKER_01
 Right, well this is the final detail design meeting.

0:00:09	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to discuss the look and fill design, the easier interface design, and we're going to evaluate the product.

0:00:18	SPEAKER_01
 And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of the remote control, like, absolute final decision.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_01
 And then I'm going to have to specify the final design in the final report.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_01
 So just from last time to recap, we're going to have a snooman shaped remote control with no LCD display, no need for torque back.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_01
 It was hopefully going to be kinetic power and battery with rubber buttons, maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal LEDs to shine through the casing, hopefully a job dial and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_01
 Anything I missed?

0:00:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so if you want to present your approach to type, go ahead.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_06
 That's it, Ninja Homo made in Japan.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_02
 There are future engines made, well look at the expansion, and it's going to be quite a lot expensive to have open up now, what's the buttons and stuff inside.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_02
 So instead of, this is going to be an LCD screen, just a very, very basic one, very small, with access to the menu through the scroll wheel and confirm and button.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, parking light is pretty much the same for the last time.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_06
 And there isn't, it doesn't open up to the advanced functions.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_06
 So the advanced functions are still hidden from you, but they're hidden in this internet, they're not in use.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_06
 Where are they?

0:01:53	SPEAKER_06
 They're in the LCD panel in the junk dial.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_01
 Ah, right.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so what kind of thing is going to be?

0:01:58	SPEAKER_06
 The LCD panel just displays functionally what you're doing.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_06
 If you're using an advanced function, right?

0:02:03	SPEAKER_06
 Like brightness, contrast, whatever.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_06
 It would just say, you know, it's like, it only has four columns, it's a very simple LCD, like, or as many, the minimum amount we need that the usual automatically know, this is brightness, or this is contrast.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_06
 It might even be one a bit more complex LCD panel, with pictures like maybe the sun, or, you know, the symbols of the virus.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_06
 And what is this here?

0:02:29	SPEAKER_06
 That's a number pad.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, so the number pad is...

0:02:32	SPEAKER_01
 Where are we going to have this slogan?

0:02:35	SPEAKER_06
 Just like, or along the side.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, cool.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_06
 You have this space here, and then you have this thing on the side as well.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_06
 Or at the bottom.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_06
 The slogans are usually quite small, right?

0:02:46	SPEAKER_06
 They're not, like, huge.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_06
 So, there's...

0:02:50	SPEAKER_06
 Say a bunch about...

0:02:52	SPEAKER_06
 Say a bunch about this size, right?

0:02:54	SPEAKER_06
 So you would still have plenty of space for a slogan?

0:02:57	SPEAKER_01
 So if this isn't to scale, what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here?

0:03:03	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I want the buttons to be big enough to push easily with the fingers.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_02
 So we're reckon that would be about the same size as the pamiarant.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, so that would be about a centimeter for a button.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_06
 So 1, 2, 3, 4 centimeters.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_06
 Plus maybe half.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_06
 Look, 5, 9 and total.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_01
 6, 7, 8.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_01
 But yeah, 9, so that sounds good.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_01
 10 centimeters.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_01
 That would be good.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_01
 So 10 centimeters in height, okay.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_01
 That would be good.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_03
 In fact, a pen is about 10 centimeters usually.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_03
 So that would be...

0:03:39	SPEAKER_03
 That sounds like a really good sign.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_03
 You see it there.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_01
 That's great, and it's very bright as well.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_03
 Is it possible...

0:03:48	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just going to bring the idea of colors.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_03
 Are these the colors that have production?

0:03:53	SPEAKER_02
 Is this just what we had available?

0:03:55	SPEAKER_02
 We're going to have again the foggy yellow and last name that's up when you...

0:04:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so you could just list all the things that it does.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_01
 So I can write them in the report.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_02
 It's fun.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_02
 Because it's red, it's very probably going to use it as...

0:04:13	SPEAKER_02
 It's going to be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_02
 I'll send it on by signal.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_02
 Apart from that, it's going to be used as a confirm button for the LCD screen.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_02
 And you use this as a joke though.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_01
 So that's like an okay button.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, we've discussed how high it is, but how wide is it?

0:04:32	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_06
 How high is it?

0:04:34	SPEAKER_06
 No, as in the height.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_06
 But what about the width?

0:04:37	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, that depth of the actual width.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, that's right.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_06
 About three and a half.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, is this to get an idea of scale from your...

0:04:47	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_01
...sharing that.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_01
 So you can par on and off.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_02
 What else can you do?

0:04:52	SPEAKER_02
 You can skip straight to the channel using these buttons.

0:04:55	None
 Okay.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_02
 We're open to having the volume control here.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_02
 But because we've got the LCD in the jogdalf, we'll just start with the volume.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, jogdalf is on.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_01
 And what else do you do with the jogdalf?

0:05:14	SPEAKER_02
 You can use it for more advanced functions like contrast, colour and...

0:05:18	SPEAKER_01
 Contrast, brightness.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 And anything else?

0:05:24	SPEAKER_02
 It's whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_02
 But then I actually got to impress by the...

0:05:30	SPEAKER_01
 What are the designers? What are they?

0:05:33	SPEAKER_02
 What can I TV do?

0:05:36	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, things like brightness contrast.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_06
 Maybe tuning the channels.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, channel.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_01
 What else?

0:05:45	SPEAKER_06
 The various inputs.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_06
 So you have a VCR, you have a knowledge input you have.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_06
 From the colour sharpness.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_06
 Color sharpness.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_06
 A lot of these things will have to be free and open for users to define them.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, what about sign settings?

0:06:03	SPEAKER_01
 Or can you change any of those at all?

0:06:05	SPEAKER_06
 Audio.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_06
 We have your basic...

0:06:08	SPEAKER_06
 Your base, your mid-range, your high-range.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_06
 You can have the bounce.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_06
 Yep.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_06
 Left-right-downs.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_06
 Maybe even pre-program sound modes.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_06
 The user could determine a series of sound modes.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_06
 Then one could happen with the...

0:06:25	SPEAKER_06
 When you click on that, then we'll go to that same.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_01
 Is there anything else that a public can do?

0:06:32	SPEAKER_01
 Because that's fine.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_01
 You just need to know so I can write it down.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_01
 Right?

0:06:41	SPEAKER_01
 I guess that's it.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_01
 So we can...

0:06:43	SPEAKER_01
 We can now have a little look at the Excel sheet and price this thing and see if we need to...

0:06:52	SPEAKER_01
 If we need to rethink anything at all.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_01
 So for this first part here, par wise, have we got...

0:07:01	SPEAKER_01
 Battery.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_01
 Do we have kinetic as well?

0:07:04	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_01
 No?

0:07:06	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_01
 Just battery.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_06
 We need...

0:07:11	SPEAKER_01
 Not because of coastal strengths, is it?

0:07:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_01
 What about the electronics here?

0:07:16	SPEAKER_06
 The bounce chip?

0:07:17	SPEAKER_06
 We need another strip, I think.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_06
 Yes.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_06
 Let me just confirm that.

0:07:21	None
 Okay.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_04
 The case, what does it mean by single and double, do you know?

0:07:28	SPEAKER_02
 I think single is a piece of one, our global, where it doubles this sort of thing.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_01
 So we want double cards?

0:07:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_01
 Plastic.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_01
 Is there any rubber at all in the button?

0:07:46	SPEAKER_01
 It's not going to have to skip the rubber.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_01
 And we want special colors, don't we?

0:07:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_01
 So I'll have to pop that.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_01
 Oh no wait, how many colors have we got there?

0:07:56	SPEAKER_06
 For the case itself, one color.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_06
 It's one special color.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_01
 It's just one color, okay?

0:08:00	SPEAKER_06
 Because the case unit itself, the rest of it, it's a little bit...

0:08:02	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_01
 So interface wise, is it this third option we have?

0:08:06	SPEAKER_06
 Yes.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_06
 The two of them there.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_06
 One.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_06
 The LC this way.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_01
 And then buttons.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_01
 I mean...

0:08:14	SPEAKER_01
 We have two colors.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_06
 Two colors.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_04
 We've got three for five.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_06
 We've got push buttons as well.

0:08:21	None
 Like...

0:08:22	SPEAKER_01
 Oh wait, so push button and integrate the school.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_02
 We've got one button for this thing.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_02
 Because it's just one big sheet of rubber.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_02
 Uh-huh.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_02
 Not sure if...

0:08:32	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, let's just be safe and put, like say, four buttons for that one.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_06
 And maybe a special color for the months, or maybe four again?

0:08:43	SPEAKER_06
 Four?

0:08:44	SPEAKER_01
 So, why are we arriving at the number four?

0:08:47	SPEAKER_01
 What is the number four come from?

0:08:49	SPEAKER_06
 Because that's one button, but it's the complexity of 12 buttons.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_06
 So we're only just estimating that, yeah, we'll be less.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_01
 But these...

0:09:00	SPEAKER_01
 Are we wanting them and...

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_01
 They're just...

0:09:04	SPEAKER_01
 Is everything going to be plastic?

0:09:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_01
 So we're...

0:09:07	SPEAKER_01
 Quite far over.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to have to go.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_01
 We're at 16.8.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_01
 And...

0:09:14	SPEAKER_03
 How...

0:09:15	SPEAKER_03
 How are we going to achieve this high-end product?

0:09:18	SPEAKER_01
 Well, something has to go to the tune of 2.3 Euro.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 So, let me see, what do we...

0:09:28	SPEAKER_01
 4.3?

0:09:29	SPEAKER_03
 4.3.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yes.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_01
 4.3.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_01
 And that's a lot.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we could take it once, but we're making it a single curve, just fill in those bits.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_05
 And then where's...

0:09:40	SPEAKER_05
 Much of that save.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_05
 How much of that save?

0:09:42	SPEAKER_06
 No, we save you one.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_06
 So, the other thing could be that you could take away the LCD panel and advance trip together.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_06
 Because when you...

0:09:50	SPEAKER_06
 Do something on the TV.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_06
 The TV responds and reacts as well.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_06
 So, the music...

0:09:55	SPEAKER_06
 You're looking at the TV and pushing this thing, so...

0:09:57	SPEAKER_06
 We may not need to...

0:09:59	SPEAKER_06
 So, when we scroll, we need to get the TV to respond.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, so...

0:10:04	SPEAKER_06
 But I think it's a technically doable thing, so...

0:10:06	SPEAKER_01
 So, what's our review suggestion?

0:10:08	SPEAKER_01
 And take away the LCD display?

0:10:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_06
 And the advance trip goes away as well.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_01
 To be replaced with a...

0:10:16	SPEAKER_01
 Regular trip.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_01
 Regular trip.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_06
 So, what that means is that...

0:10:23	SPEAKER_01
 And so, we've got 0.3 to get rid of.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_01
 And we have...

0:10:28	SPEAKER_01
 Where are the four push buttons or where exactly are?

0:10:31	SPEAKER_06
 The 12 buttons that you see there.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_06
 12 buttons.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_02
 That's one piece of rubber, but it's going to have 12 buttons.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_06
 Functionally, you have to intercept so four is a good estimate for...

0:10:41	SPEAKER_06
 Do you think?

0:10:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_06
 You can't actually cut...

0:10:45	SPEAKER_06
 It's like three times the number of buttons.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_01
 It's 4-8-12.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_01
 Is that one big button or is it 12 buttons?

0:10:52	SPEAKER_01
 How can it be something in between?

0:10:54	SPEAKER_06
 It needs to be more than one big button, because if you open up your phone...

0:10:58	SPEAKER_06
 And then there's actually one button underneath.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_06
 It's just that the panel itself is a single panel.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we have 0.3 to get rid of somewhere.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_06
 Just reported.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_06
 It has to be over budget.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_06
 Or the colors...

0:11:12	SPEAKER_06
 No, take away the colors for the buttons.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, we could just go ahead.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_06
 Normal colored buttons.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_01
 Well, do you want color differentiation here?

0:11:22	SPEAKER_06
 No, that's not the button with our buttons.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, sorry, I haven't.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_06
 The buttons only refer to the pad, so...

0:11:27	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:11:29	SPEAKER_01
 Take that off.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_01
 Oh...

0:11:32	SPEAKER_06
 It's back to the original.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_06
 So then these just become normal colored buttons.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_06
 So that might be some weird cutting the cost.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that's a shit.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_01
 Um...

0:11:45	SPEAKER_01
 Right?

0:11:47	SPEAKER_01
 So take away that completely.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_01
 Oh...

0:11:50	SPEAKER_01
 And then we're under budget.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_01
 So we do have 0.5 euro to play with if we wanted.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_03
 How about with embossing the logo?

0:11:58	SPEAKER_03
 Isn't that going to cost us some money?

0:12:00	SPEAKER_01
 Doesn't say so.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_02
 I can't bring you coins as a special form for the buttons.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's a good idea.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_01
 Just one.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_01
 Does that mean that one button has a special form?

0:12:13	SPEAKER_02
 I think one button.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_01
 Well, there we go.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm just going to have to redraw this nice.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_01
 We're not going to have the LCD anymore.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_01
 We're just going to have an on the TV.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_01
 We'll show you what you're doing.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it's fair enough.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 And so this is going to be one big thing.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_01
 Um...

0:12:34	SPEAKER_03
 Was the goal in your prototype design that it'd be as low profile as possible?

0:12:42	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, like profile.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_03
 Sort of flat as possible.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but you're being quite deep.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, deep enough to become a bit there holding your hand.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I was being white and black.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_06
 We didn't have enough play to make it.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, alright.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, just one more dimension to the thing which we need to add.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_06
 You might want to add a length width and height.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_01
 Right, okay.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_01
 So just to be thorough, then.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_01
 Width wise, we're looking at about what three centimeters or something.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_01
 And then so height wise.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_01
 How tall do you envisage a bit?

0:13:23	SPEAKER_01
 About that.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_01
 I like two centimeters, okay.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_03
 Two's not very high at all though.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_03
 This is high up.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_06
 This is about two.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_06
 Slightly more than two.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I'm by that thick.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you'll put two to three.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, we'll say 2.5.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_01
 So we have it within course anyway.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_01
 So yeah, project evaluation is this point.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_01
 Um...

0:13:51	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_01
 So can we close that?

0:13:58	SPEAKER_01
 This is what it's the final spec that's going to be.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm just going to have to...

0:14:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's fine.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_03
 It's probably just...

0:14:08	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if it's worth getting into.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_03
 But just in that we want this to be stylish, should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid?

0:14:16	SPEAKER_03
 Because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that...

0:14:19	SPEAKER_03
 Instead of taking your standard nine square grid, and they have it sort of stylized or in a different concept.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_06
 I think that's something that's very hard to catch.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_06
 So you restrict them and the more people want to try something.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_06
 Sure.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_06
 The look and the color is something which is cool.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_06
 I think that there's also that factor of...

0:14:38	SPEAKER_06
 If it's too unfamiliar.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, sure.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_03
 Because when you put it on the shape...

0:14:42	SPEAKER_03
 Or how about your square buttons?

0:14:43	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, a bunch shape might be a good idea to change.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_06
 And then other than positioning.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_06
 Because I think positioning is...

0:14:50	SPEAKER_06
 Sure.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_06
 We're kind of ingrained into the telephone kind of.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_01
 And...

0:14:56	SPEAKER_01
 Right?

0:14:57	SPEAKER_01
 So at this point, we...

0:15:02	SPEAKER_01
 Discuss how satisfied we all are with these four points with the ring for creativity and the project and leadership and teamwork and...

0:15:15	SPEAKER_01
 The stuff we had around us.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_01
 I guess I guess.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_01
 Um...

0:15:19	SPEAKER_01
 Do you want me to...

0:15:22	SPEAKER_03
 Do you want me to do my design evaluation last?

0:15:31	SPEAKER_03
 Now we're really sure what that was.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_03
 The evaluation first.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_01
 The evaluation.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_01
 You go for that first.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_01
 I wasn't tired of you to share what he was with Sweet Jane, but you go for it.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_03
 Um...

0:15:45	SPEAKER_03
 All right, so the way this works, I'm going to need to plug into PowerPoint.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_03
 I'll try and do this as quick as possible.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_03
 There you go.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_03
 Um...

0:15:52	SPEAKER_03
 I'll just go over your head if that's okay.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_06
 I don't think you need the power.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_06
 So...

0:15:57	SPEAKER_06
 Was that?

0:15:58	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, it's okay.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_06
 I don't need the PowerPoint.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_06
 No, the power...

0:16:01	SPEAKER_06
 Chored itself.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, of course.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, so then you...

0:16:04	SPEAKER_06
 You didn't want to...

0:16:05	SPEAKER_06
 I'm going to do it a bit more.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_06
 You should have got this.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_03
 What this is is a sub for us to use kind of like a...

0:16:18	SPEAKER_03
 The idea is that I've set up...

0:16:20	SPEAKER_03
 I've reviewed all of the points of discussion from the beginning and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the...

0:16:28	SPEAKER_03
 um...

0:16:30	SPEAKER_03
 uh... for the current design for the plan.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_03
 And so we can review that.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's going to end up being sort of elementary because...

0:16:39	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not going to probably use it to change anything, but...

0:16:45	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's going to end up...

0:16:47	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay, great.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_03
 And I'm going to write up our results on the board.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_03
 So this will be a way for us to go through and decide if we're...

0:16:54	SPEAKER_03
 To review where we stand at it.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:16:59	SPEAKER_03
 Um...

0:17:01	SPEAKER_03
 So sort of bringing together two things, sort of design goals, and also the market research that we had.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_03
 When we write this one is high in succeeding or fitting to our original aim in seven is low.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_03
 So these are the...

0:17:16	SPEAKER_03
 And then we've been asked to...

0:17:18	SPEAKER_03
 To collectively write this so we can do is trying to just work on a consensus system.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:17:25	SPEAKER_03
 We just come to an agreement.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_03
 So the first one...

0:17:30	SPEAKER_03
 Stylish look and feel.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_06
 I write that pretty highly.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, and we compared to most of it controls you see, that's pretty good.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know, like, six or something.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_03
 What was anybody else's name?

0:17:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, my only reservation was that we basically went with yellow because it's a company's color.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_03
 And I don't know if yellow is going to really be a hit.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_03
 But...

0:17:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_03
 You can apply that.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_03
 What do you guys think?

0:17:54	SPEAKER_01
 I would say five or six.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_06
 Non-timement.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, let's go.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_01
 Five then.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, it's one to seven.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yes.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry then.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_01
 Then I would say two to three.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_06
 Three.

0:18:07	None
 Okay.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_06
 Wait, what's the scale?

0:18:10	SPEAKER_06
 One to seven.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_06
 One is five.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_02
 One is high.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_02
 I guess, yeah, two is three.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_03
 Two to five then.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_03
 Control.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_03
 High-tech innovation.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_03
 Well, possibly we jogged out of that.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_03
 So we had to remove a few of our features we wanted.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_03
 But jogged out.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_03
 I'd say it's more...

0:18:32	SPEAKER_03
 Three or four maybe two.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_06
 Maybe two.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_06
 But going towards a little bit higher than...

0:18:36	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_03
 Kind of three.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:40	None
 Um...

0:18:41	SPEAKER_03
 Star reflects a fruit inspired color design.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, it's a color, but...

0:18:47	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, the blue colors and don't actually represent the color.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_06
 Except for the red one.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_06
 They give us for one of a...

0:18:55	SPEAKER_01
 But the yellow, I mean, it could be a yellow color.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_06
 The yellow is more representative of the color, but the button itself, the blue, can be anything else.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_03
 So two.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_03
 And design is simple to use, simple in features.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_01
 And it's really basic, but I think it is that I'd give that nearly a one.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_03
 You guys think?

0:19:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_03
 One?

0:19:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:20	None
 One.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_03
 That's fine.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_03
 Um...

0:19:23	SPEAKER_03
 Soft and spongy.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_03
 We achieve that.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_03
 We've used mostly plastic in the end.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_03
 It's going to be quite...

0:19:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, like a bit of a compromise for price.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_03
 Five.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_03
 Five?

0:19:33	SPEAKER_01
 That's really low.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's used as plastic.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's both.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_01
 Um...

0:19:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_03
 Can we use an entirely rubber frame to...

0:19:42	SPEAKER_03
 Is that an option?

0:19:43	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I probably could use a little bit of a cost.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_03
 It's a little bit more than plastic, I'm quite...

0:19:47	SPEAKER_02
 10 cents left.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_02
 Logo, we've got it in there, haven't we?

0:19:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_03
 Gonna have that in the side, I don't know what that is.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 And, um...

0:19:59	SPEAKER_03
 It's within budget.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_03
 It is, isn't it?

0:20:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so we can say then...

0:20:05	SPEAKER_03
 Out of a possible...

0:20:07	SPEAKER_03
 Or...

0:20:08	SPEAKER_03
 What would be a...

0:20:09	SPEAKER_03
 About a 49?

0:20:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, about a 49 with...

0:20:13	SPEAKER_03
 With zero being the highest.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_03
 18 cents.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_03
 And...

0:20:21	SPEAKER_03
 15.5.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_03
 And...

0:20:25	SPEAKER_03
 It's pretty good.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_03
 It turns out you're something like...

0:20:30	SPEAKER_03
 About approximately 72% efficacy...

0:20:35	SPEAKER_03
 Of our original goal.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_03
 Right?

0:20:39	SPEAKER_03
 Uh...

0:20:40	SPEAKER_04
 I think, because if you turn that into...

0:20:43	SPEAKER_03
 A hundred would be about...

0:20:46	SPEAKER_03
 Twice that?

0:20:47	SPEAKER_03
 About 31.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_03
 About 31.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 And then in the end,

0:20:51	SPEAKER_03
 31. And then invert that.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_01
 So, yeah, well, you have a 69.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, right, about 7.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_01
 It's pretty good.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_03
 That was just a little formality for us to go through.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_03
 Well, a hundred pound pen.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_05
 Sorry.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_01
 Nobody saw this on a state.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_06
 The cameras did.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_01
 Is that your finish?

0:21:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's me.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_03
 I did have one other frame.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_03
 I thought...

0:21:24	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I...

0:21:25	SPEAKER_03
 Not knowing how we would deal with this information.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_03
 I thought, okay.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_03
 In theory, this kind of process would be...

0:21:30	SPEAKER_03
 But refining our design, revisiting our original goals.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_03
 It's not something I need to push through.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_03
 But I thought, should we think more about the dimensions?

0:21:38	SPEAKER_03
 Sort of like more of a three-dimensional shapes, as well as opposed to just that...

0:21:43	SPEAKER_03
 Flat.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_03
 Could our design involve a series of colors?

0:21:46	SPEAKER_03
 That it's more of like a line where we have like sort of...

0:21:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know, like, the harvest line or the vibrant, I don't know, something like that.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_03
 Whatever.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_03
 Just some theme.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_03
 And then we have different tones, line, green, lemon.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_03
 It's just discussion.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, obviously, we need to bend, and this is fine.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_03
 Just thinking about what we originally set up to do.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_01
 Great.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_01
 Are you submitting the evaluation criteria?

0:22:13	SPEAKER_01
 What am I?

0:22:14	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know what your instructions are being made.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_03
 I think they've recorded it.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_03
 And I haven't been asked to submit it yet.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just wondering if I need to repeat it in the minutes, because if you're submitting it anyway...

0:22:28	SPEAKER_01
 I will, yeah.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, great.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_01
 Great.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_01
 Well, next up then, because we've done finance, is the project evaluation?

0:22:39	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the...

0:22:43	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, anything.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_06
 I think so.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_06
 Just in case you're wondering.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_06
 You still playing with the play-off.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_06
 Just thought, right.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_06
 I can't even get you a logo.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_06
 That's how it feels.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:23:15	None
 Okay.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_01
 Well, do you want to just individually say what you think about these four points?

0:23:30	SPEAKER_01
 And not those four points, my four points.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_01
 So, you got a different...

0:23:38	SPEAKER_03
 I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I get a different...

0:24:00	SPEAKER_01
 Right, okay.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, here we are.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know what we'll do this alphabetically.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_01
 And to the start.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_03
 Sure.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_03
 So, what is it you're asking of me now?

0:24:13	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_01
 You're opinion on those four points really, and how are we...

0:24:18	SPEAKER_01
 Sort of our work on setting this up.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_03
 Well, okay.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_03
 I'll just go through your system.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_03
 The room is very institutional.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_03
 But the main thing is, I think, our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_03
 And it would probably help to have sort of a cumulative effect of...

0:24:45	SPEAKER_03
 We have ideas and we come back, and then the ideas are still in discussion.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_03
 You know, as in other words, this room is sort of a center point of creativity.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_03
 Whereas in reality as we've gone through this, it's not really a center point of creativity.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_03
 It's more just a...

0:24:57	SPEAKER_01
 Do you feel though that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into this?

0:25:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_03
 But that's just the thing is the question in terms of the first point there, the room.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_03
 The feels of the creativity goes on, and we leave, and then we come here, and then we kind of put out our ideas.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it means the room as in this room.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_01
 I think it means like, you know...

0:25:17	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, right, right, oh, right, okay.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_03
 All right, I just looked up and thought, okay, wait for the digital pens, the room.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_01
 No, of course, yeah.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I do know, do they... I think it means... I think it means did you think you were able to give creative input?

0:25:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, answering the question in those terms.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_03
 I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this, but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of...

0:25:45	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, fashion trends, if you're in vegetable color scheme, but then we're told that you use the company colors.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_03
 So what do we do?

0:25:54	SPEAKER_03
 We're told that thinking in terms of style and looking for your own technology, but build something for 12 and a half pounds.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_03
 So actually the creativity is more of like a sort of a formality than...

0:26:08	SPEAKER_06
 I feel like caged within...

0:26:10	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, whatever...

0:26:11	SPEAKER_06
 It's like a balloon in a cage, you can go so big if not hit the side.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_01
 The costumes do come in.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_01
 Actually, let's take each point and everybody discuss that, I think.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so still on the topic of room for creativity.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_01
 Next up is Crate.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_02
 I agree with his point.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_02
 It's quite a lot of fun to go through and then you have to start at the end and go right, go out and play out, because we don't have enough money.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:34	None
 Yeah.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_06
 Another point is that the meetings are more brainstorming sessions than meetings.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_06
 So time is also a very strong factor in structure, because for brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to...

0:26:50	SPEAKER_06
 allows ideas to get tossed, to be evaluated, and to be reviewed, and to get feedback and come back.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_06
 And I guess that point about the room not being very friendly to that, I think that's a very big thing.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_06
 And I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts...

0:27:05	SPEAKER_06
 I feel it, because I wear my glasses right, but that irritates me right.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_06
 It does actually affect how...

0:27:13	SPEAKER_06
 whether you feel comfortable to communicate, I feel like I'm hiding behind the equipment, rather than the equipment is helping me.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_01
 So you think I'm wearing a relaxed atmosphere, it would be more kind of...

0:27:23	SPEAKER_06
 Not so much an atmosphere, but an atmosphere is very relaxed, but the atmosphere...

0:27:26	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, Crate's boundaries to that.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_06
 And the time given also restricts.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_01
 For you.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_01
 What about leadership?

0:27:39	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't know if I was like, if I did a good job or something, I don't really know.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction and encouragement.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_01
 So like your personal coach, personal stuff like that?

0:27:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, from you as well.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_03
 I think you're team leader.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think it's good.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, my personal views on leadership is that...

0:28:04	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, it gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation, but then come back to something that they take great ownership and innovative thought with.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_03
 In reality, I think here the different elements of leadership, such as the original briefing and then the personal coach, and then having you with the meeting agenda is actually quite a...

0:28:28	SPEAKER_03
 quite a confining framework to work with in.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_03
 And so it is leadership, also the point of sort of disempowering the team member.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_03
 But it's not bad leadership, it's just sort of fairly strong.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_03
 It turns the individual into more of like a sort of predetermined mechanism as opposed to...

0:28:50	SPEAKER_01
 So you think maybe I'm too controlling or...

0:28:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I think controlling is not the right word.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_06
 The interaction is very structured. I think structure is probably what you're saying that...

0:29:01	SPEAKER_06
 Each individual is structured to one particular task, and one, rather than controlling, I don't mean as a sense of control, because our decisions have been made in terms of a consensus, right?

0:29:11	SPEAKER_06
 We go around and we think about it, but that process actually says you have to do it in a certain way.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_06
 It doesn't tell you, you know, so mostly you might want to be a bit more creative in terms of the process.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, not that. Okay. What about teamwork?

0:29:29	SPEAKER_02
 Does it work?

0:29:31	SPEAKER_02
 That was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_02
 If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them, I would have been out of all you's here.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_06
 I think you tried to use the common share folder to communicate, but...

0:29:48	SPEAKER_06
 It just comes back to us so slow in the email.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_06
 It doesn't have a messenger.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_01
 Did you guys get the email I sent you?

0:29:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I was wondering if that got there.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_01
 So to summarize the teamwork issue, saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting, you know, just like quick questions, quick thoughts, whatever, it probably would be...

0:30:14	SPEAKER_06
 I think the tools that they were given, the tools that they were given to us are fancy, but they don't support collaboration. I think that's the word. They don't support the team working together.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah. I mean, they're still very individual tools.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. I mean, sort of taking upon that idea, the way I see this, is that it's the structure in which we've approached this whole task, is quite contrary to the principle of teamwork, because the tasks were sort of divided.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_03
 And then the work went on in isolation.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what you guys did while you were together. Maybe that was a bit different.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_03
 But actually, if you imagine not entirely completely same task given to us, but us said, okay, first thing we have to do is come up with, let's say, a design concept, and we sit here together and do it.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_03
 That's what teamwork is, to say, okay, go off and don't talk to each other.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_03
 It actually sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_03
 Not that we haven't done, I think, the best we could have done.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_03
 Not dissatisfied with it.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_01
 Right. And I'll say, I'm teamwork tool.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_01
 What about the, you know, how we use the whiteboards, the digital pens, the projector, stuff like that?

0:31:36	SPEAKER_01
 Did anybody think anything was that really useful?

0:31:39	SPEAKER_01
 Anything with pretty unsported?

0:31:42	SPEAKER_03
 I think the whiteboard, for me, is the kind of thing I would use all the time.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_03
 But it's not quite as useful as it to us as it could have been, maybe just in the way that we use it in the sense that once we have an idea out there, or while work was going on in between meetings, that could have been up on a board, you know, the post to, in, like, in text.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_03
 And then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_03
 I know that people who design cars and, you know, an aviation, they quite often just have a simple, like, fiberglass prototype.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_03
 And it's completely, you know, abstract from the final product, but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and point that point and discuss.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_03
 And in a way, everybody's, as we discuss things in the, theoretically, and out of our notebooks, we're just, we're actually just, each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds, it wasn't until we had this year, you know, like at one point I peeked across and looked at Craig's paper and I'm like, now I know what he's thinking, because I saw his book.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_03
 But the whiteboard could have actually been this kind of continuing.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_01
 So do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process would have been a good idea?

0:32:51	SPEAKER_06
 I think the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the whiteboard.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_06
 And I think that that is also does in those things.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_06
 I think it would be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the PowerPoint, or maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPoint in the same place.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare, whereas I can imagine if I had been encouraged to use paintbrush, for example, or whatever, I would have actually used it.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_03
 Just because that's sort of how we were set up to you, do you have that time?

0:33:30	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_06
 I think there are too many PowerPoints and then links.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_06
 The plugin and the plugins spent a lot of time doing that.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_06
 And a lot of information on the PowerPoints.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_06
 I don't think, you know, you need it to actually, we could have gone through it in very verbally, especially in my slides, I felt that.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_06
 You know, as opposed to having to present them.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_01
 What about the digital pens? Did you find them easy enough to use?

0:33:52	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_06
 Yep, Kunky.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_06
 Agreed.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_06
 Kunky, okay.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_01
 Having to take it before you go off was a bit hindering as well,

0:34:06	SPEAKER_06
 because you have to go through a thought and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_01
 I know, I think at the very start of today, I, like, who did a stuff, didn't click note on one, then went back and wrote one tiny thing on the another page, but then they clicked note.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm quite worried that I've just written over the top of it or something, but they'll have my paper anyway.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_06
 But I think the pen is very intuitive.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_06
 Everybody knows how to use it.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_06
 You don't even have to worry.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_03
 I think the pen's good.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_03
 It's about the best thing.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_03
 On the topic of the technology, it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers, because each computer has all of the files.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_03
 It just occurred to me that they...

0:34:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we only needed one computer.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. If there had been a thing, they could have just been sitting there ready to go to home.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_06
 And the computer may not be conducive to a meeting, because you tend to look at your computer and want to have the urge to check something.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_01
 You know, it's useful, but...

0:35:02	SPEAKER_01
 Do you think the computers just provide distraction on the meeting?

0:35:04	SPEAKER_06
 I think too many computers are just distracting.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_01
 And I like to have things written down in front of me, actually.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_01
 Like, a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me, I ended up writing down there or something, so I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if I have any video else.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_01
 What else?

0:35:26	SPEAKER_01
 Any...

0:35:27	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not really sure what the looking for in the same new ideas find.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know, as you could think of that, anything else that would have been helpful today.

0:35:39	SPEAKER_01
 At all.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_01
 Wow.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_03
 The main one for me is that the process and a natural context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_03
 That's kind of a new idea for me, is like just sort of that idea.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_03
 And it's kind of hard to keep working forward on a team-based project when you're told you must now work away from each other.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_01
 I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings, because they really could have run on.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_01
 And my experience with meetings is that they really do.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_01
 And you can spend a lot of time talking about it.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_01
 The only thing is, when we had our meeting about the conceptual design, I thought there may be another 15 minutes would have been useful there.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_01
 I think maybe if we all have been working in the one room and they just said, you know, like every hour or something, everybody makes sure you just have a short meeting.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_01
 And then just to have something written down, just like a milestone, if you like.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_01
 And my mother's in having meetings, but there you go.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_01
 So, it's so confusing.

0:37:02	SPEAKER_01
 I haven't got my five minutes to go.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, there it is.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_01
 Five minutes to go.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_01
 Wonderful.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, are the courses in the budget?

0:37:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, they are.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_01
 And is the project evaluated?

0:37:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, it is.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_01
 It's a nice, elaborate.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_01
 So we have Ninja, or not?

0:37:17	SPEAKER_06
 Well, apparently not.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_01
 I write the final report.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_03
 What are you guys doing, though?

0:37:22	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, wow.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_01
 That is lovely.

0:37:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_02
 I said Ninja Homer.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_06
 What did you call it?

0:37:31	SPEAKER_06
 Ninja Homer.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_06
 See, it looks like Homer Simpson.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_06
 So it's made the whole thing?

0:37:36	SPEAKER_01
 Is that the stilago, or is it doing a thing?

0:37:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, just the logo.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_01
 Just the logo.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_01
 And then like Ninja Homer, right?

0:37:43	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:37:45	SPEAKER_06
 The red is supposed to represent whatever else you want to print on the side of it.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_03
 It's crashing technology or something.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_06
 So you can wear a Homer.

0:37:55	SPEAKER_06
 You can throw Homer when you're frustrated.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_06
 Dot.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_06
 That's cool.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_01
 I'm kind of, I'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_01
 I think that would have been nice.

0:38:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, well.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe for now, I'm real reaction.

0:38:09	SPEAKER_01
 Should give us more money.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, I did learn something.

0:38:11	SPEAKER_06
 Play-doh is useful.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_06
 No, it is.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_06
 It is.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_06
 It is useful in conceptualizing in being creative.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_06
 It's like you say it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:38:24	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, the sense where we were playing with the play-doh and the ideas came with the play-doh.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_06
 Did they?

0:38:28	SPEAKER_06
 Rather than with everything else, you might want to write that.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_02
 I'm just feeling with the play-doh, isn't it?

0:38:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_02
 Play-doh.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_02
 Play-doh.

0:38:36	SPEAKER_02
 So I've got to have you just play the smells.

0:38:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it smells funny, doesn't it?

0:38:38	SPEAKER_03
 And the play-dohs are actually edible, aren't they?

0:38:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, let's stuff real.

0:38:41	SPEAKER_01
 I think it has to be a...

0:38:43	SPEAKER_06
 It's just wheat.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_06
 It's the stuff that your mom could make with preserveism, though.

0:38:47	SPEAKER_01
 So what are your summarizing words about play-doh?

0:38:51	SPEAKER_06
 It's helpful to the creative process.

0:38:53	SPEAKER_06
 It engages all your senses, not just your sight, but your sense of feel, your sense of touch, and it helps you to understand.

0:39:01	SPEAKER_06
 I mentioned as well.

0:39:03	SPEAKER_06
 I think that's very helpful because it's such to pop up, whereas on a piece of paper on a computer on a board, even with a treaty graphic thing, it still requires a lot of...

0:39:12	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, tangible.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, tangible.

0:39:14	SPEAKER_06
 That's a nice word.

0:39:15	SPEAKER_06
 It becomes tangible.

0:39:17	SPEAKER_06
 Mm-hmm.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_01
 Tangible.

0:39:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:39:23	SPEAKER_01
 Errrr.

0:39:25	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if there's anything else.

0:39:33	SPEAKER_01
 Nope.

0:39:34	SPEAKER_01
 Ready to discuss.

0:39:36	SPEAKER_01
 That's about it, really.

0:39:39	SPEAKER_01
 This is still, I guess, for the one.

0:39:43	SPEAKER_03
 Do we retreat to our...

0:39:46	SPEAKER_03
 I think we could probably do it here.

0:39:49	SPEAKER_06
 What do you know?

0:39:51	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sure that the little thing will pop up any minute now.

0:39:56	SPEAKER_06
 Can you turn off the microphones?

0:39:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:39:59	SPEAKER_01
 The meeting's over, then, yeah.

0:40:01	SPEAKER_06
 And my microphone has no signal.

0:40:06	None
 Which would explain why you don't get any signal.

0:40:10	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, it might be because of the power, though.

0:40:17	SPEAKER_03
 I think the time has to run out first to get any more instructions.

0:40:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:40:23	None
 Doesn't it?

0:40:24	None
 Yeah.

0:40:27	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:40:30	None
 Yeah.

0:40:38	None
 Yeah.

0:40:48	SPEAKER_03
 That's really cool.

0:40:49	SPEAKER_03
 I can see the...

0:40:51	SPEAKER_03
 The talk.

0:40:52	SPEAKER_03
 I can see my own boy on the...

0:40:56	SPEAKER_03
 He really watch.

0:41:01	None
 Yeah.

0:42:01	None
 Yeah.

0:42:11	None
 Yeah.

0:42:19	None
 Yeah.

0:42:22	None
 Yeah.

0:42:24	None
 Yeah.

0:42:27	None
 Yeah.

0:42:29	None
 Yeah.

0:42:59	None
 Yeah.

0:43:29	None
 Yeah.

0:43:32	None
 Yeah.

0:43:35	None
 Yeah.

0:43:38	None
 Yeah.

0:43:41	None
 Yeah.

0:43:44	None
 Yeah.
