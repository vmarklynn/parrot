0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, we're all set.

0:00:05	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:00:06	SPEAKER_01
 Well, this is the final detailed design meeting.

0:00:12	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to discuss the look and feel design, the easier interface design, and we're going to evaluate the product.

0:00:18	SPEAKER_01
 And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control, like absolute final decision.

0:00:25	SPEAKER_01
 And then I'm going to have to specify the final design in the final report.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_01
 So just from last time to recap, we said we were going to have a snowman shaped remote control with no LCD display, no need for talk back.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_01
 It was hopefully going to be kinetic power and battery with rubber buttons, maybe back lighting the buttons with some internal LEDs to shine through the casing, hopefully a job dial, incorporating the slogan somewhere as well.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_01
 Anything I missed?

0:00:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_01
 Sue, if you want to present your prototype, go ahead.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_06
 That's it.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_06
 Ninja Homa made in Japan.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_02
 There are a few tunes we've made.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_02
 We're looking at the expansion.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_02
 And it's going to be quite a lot expensive to have open up now what's the buttons and stuff inside.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_02
 So instead of this is going to be an LCD screen.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_02
 Just a very, very basic one, very small, with access to the menu through the screw wheel and confirm.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_02
 And button.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_02
 Part of my, there's pretty much the same thing we discussed last time.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_06
 And there isn't a, it doesn't open up to the advanced functions.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_06
 So the advanced functions are still hidden from you, but they're hidden in this inset.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_06
 They're not in use.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_06
 Where are they?

0:01:52	SPEAKER_06
 They're in the LCD panel and the job dial.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_06
 All right.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_01
 So what kind of thing is going to be?

0:01:58	SPEAKER_06
 The LCD panel just displays functionally what you're doing.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_06
 If you're using an advanced function, right, like brightness, contrast, whatever, it would just say, you know, it's like, it only has four columns.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_06
 It's a very simple LCD.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_06
 Like, or as many, the minimum amount we need that they usually automatically know, like, this is brightness, or this is contrast.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_06
 It might even be one, a bit more complex LCD panel, which pictures like maybe the sun, or, you know, the symbols of the various.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_06
 And what is this here?

0:02:27	SPEAKER_06
 That's a number pad.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_01
 So the number pad is where we're going to have the slogan.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_06
 Um, just like along the side.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_06
 Cool.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_06
 You have this space here and then you have this thing on the side as well, or at the bottom.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_06
 So, the slogans are usually quite small, right?

0:02:45	SPEAKER_06
 They're not like huge.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_06
 So, there's, say, buttons about this size, right?

0:02:53	SPEAKER_06
 So you would still have plenty of space for a slogan.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_01
 So if this isn't to scale, what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here?

0:03:02	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I want the buttons to be bigger enough to push easily with my fingers.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_02
 So we're going to, maybe that'll be about the same size as in Pam and, yeah.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_06
 So that would be about centimeter for a button.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_06
 So one, two, three, four centimeters plus maybe half, five, six, seven, eight.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_01
 That sounds good.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_01
 That would be good.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_01
 So 10 centimeters in height.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_01
 Um, that would be good.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_01
 In fact, a pen is about 10 centimeters usually.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_01
 So that would be, that sounds like a really good sign.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_03
 You see it there.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_03
 That's great.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_01
 And it's very bright as well.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_01
 So, um, okay.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_03
 Is it possible?

0:03:47	SPEAKER_03
 Uh, just going to bring up the idea of colors.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_03
 Is these, are these the colors that have production?

0:03:52	SPEAKER_03
 Um, is this just what we had available?

0:03:54	SPEAKER_02
 We're going to have again the sort of the foggy, um, yellow, masking that the app when you beat the button, right?

0:04:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_01
 I can do this list of all the things that it does.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_02
 So I can write them in the report.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_02
 Um, this button.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_02
 Um, because it's red, it's sort of very small.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to use it as, uh, it's going to be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_02
 I'll send it in the mic if you want to make a change, or be used to be more popular and can use this as a jog though.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. So that's like an okay button?

0:04:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_06
 Mm-hmm.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, we discussed how high it is, but how wide is it?

0:04:30	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_06
 How high is it?

0:04:33	SPEAKER_06
 No, as in the height.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_06
 But what about the width?

0:04:37	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, like depth of the...

0:04:39	SPEAKER_01
 We need five.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, we need about three and a half.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, is this to get an idea of scale from your...

0:04:46	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_02
 No, what else can you do?

0:04:52	SPEAKER_02
 You can skip straight to the channel using these buttons.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_02
 We're going to have the volume control here.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_02
 But because we've got the LCD and the jog dial, we just start with the new start as the volume.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, jog dial for volume.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_01
 What else do you do as the jog dial?

0:05:13	SPEAKER_02
 You can use it for more advanced functions like contrast, color, and...

0:05:18	SPEAKER_01
 Contrast.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_01
 Contrast.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_01
 Brightness.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_01
 And then if not...

0:05:24	SPEAKER_02
 Um, it's whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_02
 Um, but then I still got to inspect by the...

0:05:30	SPEAKER_01
 Well, as the designers, what are they?

0:05:32	SPEAKER_02
 Uh, what can a TV do?

0:05:34	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, things like, um, brightness contrast.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_06
 Uh-huh.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_06
 Um, maybe tuning the channels.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, channels.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_01
 Um, what else?

0:05:43	SPEAKER_01
 Um, the various inputs.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_06
 So, you're having VCR, you're having, you know, which input you have.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_01
 Exactly.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_06
 Probably color sharpness.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_06
 Color sharpness.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_06
 Um, a lot of these things will have to be, um, free and open for users to define them.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, what about, uh, sign settings?

0:06:02	SPEAKER_01
 Or can you change any of those at all?

0:06:04	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_06
 Audio.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_06
 We have like your basic...

0:06:07	SPEAKER_06
 Your base, your mid-range, your high-range.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_06
 Um, they have the bounce.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_06
 Yep.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_06
 Left-right-balance.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_06
 Um, maybe even pre-programmed.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_06
 Um, the user could determine, like, a series of sound modes, and then what could happen would be, um, when you click on that, then we'll go to that setting.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_01
 Is there anything else that it can do?

0:06:33	SPEAKER_01
 Cause that's fine.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_01
 You just need to know so I can write it down.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_01
 Um, right?

0:06:39	SPEAKER_01
 I guess that's it.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_01
 So we can now, um, we can now have a little look at, uh, the Excel sheet and price this thing and see if we need to, um, if we need to rethink anything at all.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_01
 So, um, for this first part here, par-wise, have we got...

0:07:01	SPEAKER_01
 Battery.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_01
 Battery.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_01
 Do we have kinetic as well?

0:07:04	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_01
 No?

0:07:06	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_01
 Um, just battery.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_06
 We need...

0:07:11	SPEAKER_01
 That's because of cost restraints, is it?

0:07:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_01
 Um, what about the electronics here?

0:07:16	SPEAKER_06
 We need a...

0:07:17	SPEAKER_06
 The advanced chip.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_06
 Let me just confirm that.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_06
 Yes, I think so.

0:07:27	None
 Okay.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_01
 Um, the case, what does it mean by single and double, do you know?

0:07:32	SPEAKER_02
 I think single just be sort of one, or a double, where it doubles this sort of thing.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_01
 Double car.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:07:39	None
 Okay.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_01
 Um...

0:07:41	SPEAKER_01
 Plastic.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_01
 Is there any rubber at all in the button?

0:07:46	SPEAKER_01
 I think we're gonna have to skip a rubber.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_01
 Um, and we want it to special colors, don't we?

0:07:52	SPEAKER_01
 So, I'll have to pop that.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, no, wait.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_01
 How many colors have we got there?

0:07:56	SPEAKER_06
 For the case itself, one color.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_06
 It's one special color.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_01
 Just one color, okay.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_06
 Because the case unit itself, the rest of it.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_01
 So, interface-wise, is it this third option we have?

0:08:06	SPEAKER_06
 It's one of the other ones.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_01
 Um, then buttons.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, we have one.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_01
 Two colors.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_01
 We've got push buttons as well.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_06
 Like, oh wait, so push button and integrated screw.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_02
 We've got one button for this thing, because it's just one big sheet of rubber.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_02
 Uh-huh.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_02
 Um, not sure if that counts.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_06
 So, let's just be safe and put, like, say, four buttons for that one.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_06
 Um, and maybe a special color for the months.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_06
 So, maybe four again.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_06
 Four.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_01
 So, why are we arriving at the number four?

0:08:47	SPEAKER_01
 Where does the number four come from?

0:08:48	SPEAKER_06
 Because that's one button, but it's the complexity of 12 buttons.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_06
 So, we're just estimating that, yeah, it'll be less.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 Are we wanting them?

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_01
 Is everything going to be faster?

0:09:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_01
 So, we're all quite far over.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_01
 Something's going to have to go.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_01
 Um, we're at 16.8.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_01
 And...

0:09:14	SPEAKER_03
 How are we going to achieve this high end product?

0:09:18	SPEAKER_01
 Well, something has to go to the tune of 2.3 euro.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 So, let me see.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_01
 What are we?

0:09:28	SPEAKER_01
 I mean...

0:09:29	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah, sorry, 4.3.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, we could take it once when we can get a single curve.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_02
 Just fill in those bits.

0:09:37	None
 Yeah.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_05
 And then we're...

0:09:39	SPEAKER_05
 How much did that say?

0:09:40	SPEAKER_05
 How much did that say?

0:09:41	SPEAKER_05
 That one say if you want one.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_06
 The other thing could be that, um, you could take away the LCD panel and advance chip together.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_06
 Um, because when you do something on the TV, the TV responds and reacts as well.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_06
 So, the user could be looking at the TV and pushing this thing so they may not need to...

0:09:58	SPEAKER_06
 So, when we scroll, we need just some way to get the TV to respond.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, so...

0:10:03	SPEAKER_06
 Which I think is a technically doable thing, so...

0:10:05	SPEAKER_01
 So, what's our review suggestion?

0:10:07	SPEAKER_01
 Um, take away the LCD display.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_06
 And the advance chip goes away as well.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_01
 To be replaced with a...

0:10:16	SPEAKER_01
 Regular chip.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_01
 Regular chip.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_06
 So, what that means is that...

0:10:22	SPEAKER_06
 Oh.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_01
 So, we've got 0.3 to get rid of.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_01
 Um, and we have...

0:10:28	SPEAKER_01
 Where are the four...

0:10:29	SPEAKER_01
 The four push buttons are where exactly now?

0:10:31	SPEAKER_06
 The 12 buttons that you see there.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_01
 12 buttons?

0:10:34	SPEAKER_02
 That's one piece of rubber, but it's going to have 12 buttons.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_06
 Functionally, you have to intercept.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_06
 So, 4 is a good estimate for...

0:10:41	SPEAKER_01
 Do you think?

0:10:42	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_06
 So, you can't actually cut...

0:10:45	SPEAKER_06
 It's like three times the number of buttons.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_01
 4, 8, 12.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_01
 Is that one big button or is it 12 buttons?

0:10:52	SPEAKER_01
 How can it be something in between?

0:10:54	SPEAKER_06
 It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone and then there's actually one button underneath, it's just that the panel itself is a single panel.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we have 0.3 to get rid of somewhere.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_06
 Just report that it has to be over budget.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_06
 Or the colors.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_06
 No, there's no...

0:11:13	SPEAKER_06
 Take away colors for the buttons.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, we could just go with normal color buttons.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_01
 Well, do you want color differentiation here?

0:11:22	SPEAKER_06
 No, that's not the button with all of this.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, sorry.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_06
 The buttons only refer to the pads.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:11:28	SPEAKER_01
 Take that off.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_01
 Aww.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_06
 It's back to the original.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_06
 So then these just become normal color buttons.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_06
 So that might be some way of cutting the cost.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_01
 Off that's the sheet.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_01
 And...

0:11:45	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_01
 So take away that completely.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_01
 Aww.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_01
 And now we're under budget.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_01
 So we do have 0.5 euro to play with if we wanted.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_03
 How about with embossing the logo?

0:11:57	SPEAKER_03
 Isn't that going to cost us some money?

0:11:59	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't say so.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_02
 I can't afford your current as a special form for the buttons.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's a good idea.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_01
 There's one.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_01
 Does that mean that one button has a special form or...?

0:12:13	SPEAKER_02
 I think one button.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_02
 There's just one button.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_01
 Well, there we go.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm just going to have to re-draw this nice.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_01
 We're not going to have the LCD anymore.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_01
 We're just going to have an on the TV.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_01
 It'll show you what you're doing.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_01
 But I think it's fair enough.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 And so this is going to be one big thing here.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_01
 Erm...

0:12:35	SPEAKER_03
 Was the goal in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible?

0:12:41	SPEAKER_03
 What do you mean by profile?

0:12:43	SPEAKER_03
 Sort of flat as possible.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_02
 It's quite deep.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_02
 It's quite deep.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_06
 It's quite light and black.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_06
 Sure.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_06
 We didn't have enough play to make it.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_06
 Alright.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_06
 Just...

0:13:00	SPEAKER_06
 So there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to add.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_01
 And you might want to add in a report length width and height.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_01
 So just to...

0:13:08	SPEAKER_01
 Well, to be thorough then, width wise, we're looking at about what three centimeters or something?

0:13:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_01
 So height wise...

0:13:19	SPEAKER_01
 High toward envisaging.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_01
 I like that.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_01
 I like two centimeters.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_03
 Two's not very high at all though.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_03
 This is about two.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_06
 Slightly more than two.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_06
 I'm about that thick.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe closer to three.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_01
 We'll say two point five.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_01
 So we have it within cost anyway.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 So yeah.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_01
 Project evaluation is this point.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_01
 So can we close that?

0:13:58	SPEAKER_01
 This is what it's the final spec that's going to be.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm just going to have to...

0:14:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_03
 That's fine.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_03
 It's probably just...

0:14:08	SPEAKER_03
 It's worth getting into.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_03
 But just in that we want this to be stylish, should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid?

0:14:16	SPEAKER_03
 Because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that instead of taking your standard nine square grid and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_06
 I think that's something that's very hard to catch.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_06
 So you restrict the number of people when they try something.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_06
 Sure.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_06
 The look and the color is something which is cool.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_06
 So there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_06
 Sure.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_03
 Because when you put it on the shelf...

0:14:42	SPEAKER_06
 Or button shape.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_06
 Square buttons.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_06
 Bunch shape might be a good idea to change.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_06
 Rather than positioning.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_06
 Because I think positioning is...

0:14:50	SPEAKER_06
 Sure.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_06
 We're kind of ingrained into the telephone kind of.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_01
 So at this point we...

0:15:01	SPEAKER_01
 Is it?

0:15:03	SPEAKER_01
 Discuss how satisfied we all are with these four points with the room for creativity in the project and leadership and teamwork and the stuff we have.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_01
 Or on this I guess.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_03
 Do you want me to...

0:15:28	SPEAKER_03
 Do you want me to do my design evaluation last?

0:15:32	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not really sure what that was.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_01
 Evaluation.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_01
 Go for that first.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_01
 I wasn't entirely sure what he was supposed to be doing that but you go for it.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_03
 So the way this works.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to need to plug in the PowerPoint.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_03
 I'll try and do it as quick as possible.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_03
 So I'll just go over your head if that's okay.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_06
 I don't think you need the power.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_06
 So what's that?

0:15:57	SPEAKER_06
 It's okay.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_06
 It's okay.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_06
 I don't need the power point.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_06
 The power cord itself.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, of course.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_06
 Freedom.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_06
 A bit more.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_03
 So what this is is a sub-frust to use kind of like a...

0:16:18	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure what the idea is that I've set up, I've reviewed all of the points of discussion from the beginning and use that as a criteria of evaluation for the...

0:16:31	SPEAKER_03
 For the current design or the plan and so we can review that.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's going to end up being sort of elementary because we're not going to properly use it to change anything but...

0:16:47	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, great.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_03
 And I'm going to write up our results on the board so this will be a way for us to go through and decide if we're...

0:16:54	SPEAKER_03
 To review where we're standing.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:16:59	SPEAKER_03
 So sort of bringing together two things for design goals and also the market research that we had.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_03
 When we write this, one is high in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_03
 So these are... and then we've been asked to... to collectively write this so we can use try and just keep work on a consensus system.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_03
 So we just come to an agreement.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_03
 So the first one, the stylish look and feel.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_06
 I rate that pretty high.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_01
 Well, yeah.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_01
 I mean compared to most remote controls you see, that's pretty good.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't know like a six or something.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_03
 What does anybody else say?

0:17:41	SPEAKER_03
 My only reservation was that we basically went with yellow because it's a company's color and I don't know if yellow is going to really be a hit.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_01
 But...

0:17:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_01
 I should apply that.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_03
 What do you guys think?

0:17:53	SPEAKER_01
 I would say five or six.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_06
 Yep.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_06
 I'm fine with that.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, it's actually one to seven.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yes.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_06
 Then I would say two or three.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_06
 Wait.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_06
 What's the scale?

0:18:09	SPEAKER_06
 One to seven.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_06
 One is high.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_02
 Two is free.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_03
 So that's a bit more than five then.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_03
 Control high tech innovation.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_03
 Well, how do we jog down?

0:18:25	SPEAKER_03
 So we had to remove a few of our features we wanted, but jog down.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_03
 I'd say it's more three or four.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_06
 Maybe, yeah, but going towards a little bit higher than medium.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_03
 Style reflects a fruit inspired colored line.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_03
 Let me say color.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_06
 The blue colors and don't actually represent the color except for the red button.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_06
 For one of the yellow.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it could be a yellow color.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_06
 The yellow is more representative of the color, but the button itself, the blue can be anything else.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_03
 So two.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_03
 And design is simple to use, simple and features.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_01
 And it's really basic.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I'd give that nearly a one.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_03
 You guys think?

0:19:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_03
 One.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_03
 One.

0:19:20	None
 That's fine.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_03
 Soft and spongy.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_03
 We achieved that.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_03
 We've used mostly plastic in the end.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_03
 Bye.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_03
 Bye.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_01
 That's really low.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I have to use a plastic.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_01
 It's closed.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_03
 Could we use an entirely rubber frame?

0:19:44	SPEAKER_03
 Is that an option?

0:19:46	SPEAKER_03
 I think it would be close.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_02
 It would be more than plastic.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_02
 And then it seems like logo.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_03
 We've got it in there.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_01
 Gonna have that on the side.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_03
 And it's within budget.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_03
 So we can say then.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_03
 Out of a possible.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_01
 Or.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_03
 49 with zero being highest.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_03
 And.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_03
 15.5.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_03
 Pretty good.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_03
 Translate to something like.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_03
 About approximately 72% efficacy.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_03
 Of our original goal.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_03
 I think because if you turn that into.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_03
 A hundred.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_03
 It would be about.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_01
 Twice that.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 About 31.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_03
 And then invert that.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_01
 So yeah, well, you have a 69.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, right.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_03
 That's pretty good.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_03
 That was just a little formality for us to go through.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, a hundred pound pen.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_01
 Nobody saw that on a stick.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_06
 Cameras did.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_01
 Is that your finish?

0:21:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's that's me.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_03
 I did have one other one other frame.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I'm not knowing how we would deal with this information.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_03
 I thought, okay.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_03
 In theory, this kind of process would be, but refining our design.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_03
 Re-visiting our original goals.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_03
 It's not something I need to push through, but I thought.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_03
 We're thinking more about the dimensions.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_03
 Sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_03
 Flat.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_03
 Could our design of all the series of colors that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know, like the harvest line or the vibrant.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_03
 Whatever, just some theme and we have different tones, line, green.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_03
 It's just discussion.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, obviously we can just abandon this.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_03
 It's fine.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_03
 Just thinking about what we originally said it to do.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_03
 Great.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_01
 Are you submitting the.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_01
 The evaluation criteria for my, I don't know what your instructions are being.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_03
 I think they record it and I haven't been asked to submit it yet.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_01
 Just wondering if I need to shoot it in the minutes because if you're submitting it anyway.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_01
 I will.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_01
 Great.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_01
 Well, next up then, because we've done finance is the project evaluation.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_06
 I'm listening.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_06
 I'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_06
 So I'm playing with the play.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_06
 Just in case you're wondering.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_06
 Just about right.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_01
 Do you want to just individually say you think about about these four points and not those four points.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_01
 My four points.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_01
 I like this printer cables.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_03
 I just have the two little buttons like clips.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_01
 So here we are.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_01
 As I know, we'll do this alphabetically and to the start.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_03
 So what is it you're asking me now?

0:24:13	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_01
 In your opinion on those four, these four points really and how we.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_03
 I sort of are working on setting this up.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_03
 Well, okay.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_03
 I'll just go through your system.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_03
 The room.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_03
 Is.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_03
 Is.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_03
 The main thing is, I think.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_03
 Our use of the space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_03
 Constructive and would probably help to.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_03
 Have a sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_03
 In other words, this room is sort of a center point of creativity.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_01
 But do you feel that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into this?

0:25:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_03
 But that's just the thing is the question in terms of the first point there, the room.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_03
 It feels that the creativity goes on.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_03
 We leave and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it means the room is in this room.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_01
 It means like, you know, all right, all right.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_03
 I just looked up and said, okay, wait for a digital pen to the room.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_01
 Of course.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_01
 I think it means, I think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_03
 If answering the question in those terms, I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this, but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_03
 Fashion trends, a fruit and vegetable color scheme, but then we're told that he's company company colors.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_03
 So what do we do?

0:25:53	SPEAKER_03
 We're told, okay.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_03
 I think in terms of style and looking feel and technology, but build something for 12 and a half pounds.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_03
 So actually the creativity was more of like a sort of a formality than.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_06
 You feel like caged within whatever you strength.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_06
 It's like a balloon in a cage. You can go so big. If not hit the site.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_01
 The constraints do come in.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_01
 Actually, let's take each point and everybody discuss that.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_01
 So still on the topic of room for creativity.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_01
 Next up is great.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_02
 I agree with his point.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_02
 It's quite like fun to go to and then you have to have the end and go right.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_02
 Go everything out because we don't have enough money.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:34	None
 Yeah.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_06
 I think another point is that the meetings are more brainstorming sessions than meetings.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_06
 So time is also a very strong factor and structure.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_06
 Because for brainstorming meeting, you want to structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed to be evaluated and to be reviewed and to get feedback and come back.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_06
 And I guess that point about the room not being very friendly to that, I think that's a very big thing. And I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_06
 I feel it because I wear my glasses right.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_06
 But that irritates me.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_06
 It does actually affect how, whether you feel comfortable to communicate.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_06
 I feel like I'm hiding behind the equipment rather than the equipment is helping me.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_06
 So you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of, not so much an atmosphere is very relaxed, but the actual environment creates boundaries to that.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_06
 And the time given also restricts.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_01
 Very good.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_01
 What about leadership?

0:27:38	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if I did a good job or something.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction encouragement.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm like your personal coach person and stuff like that.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, from in you as well.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_03
 I think I'm sort of acting as a team leader.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think it's huge.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's good.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, my personal views on leadership is that effective leadership sort of gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation, but then to come back to something that they take great ownership and innovative thought with.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_03
 In reality, I think here the different elements of leadership, such as the original briefing and then the personal coach and then having you with the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a, quite a confining framework to work with.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_03
 And so it is leadership, most of the point of sort of disempowering the team member.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. But it's not bad leadership is just sort of fairly strong.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_03
 It turns it turns the individual into more of like a sort of predetermined mechanism as opposed to.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_01
 So they may be able to control him or.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_05
 I think controlling is not the right word.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, the interaction is very structured.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_06
 I think structure is probably what you're saying that each individual is structured to one particular task and one rather than controlling.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_06
 I don't mean as a sense of control because decisions have been made in terms of a consensus, right?

0:29:10	SPEAKER_06
 We go around and we think about it, but that, you know, process actually says you have to do it in a certain way.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_06
 It doesn't tell you, you know, sometimes you might want to be a bit more creative in terms of the process.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_01
 Not that.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_01
 What about teamwork?

0:29:27	SPEAKER_02
 Did you want to correct? That was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_02
 If we could just go up somebody outside meeting and have a quick talk to them, I would have been that a lot easier.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_06
 You tried to use the common share folder to communicate, but it just comes back to us so slow in the email.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_06
 It doesn't have a messenger.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_01
 Did you guys get the email I sent you?

0:29:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_01
 I was wondering if that got very good.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_01
 So to summarize the teamwork issue, saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting, you know, just like quick questions, quick thoughts, whatever, it probably would be.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_06
 I think the tools that they were given, the tools that they were given to us are fancy, but they don't support collaboration.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_06
 I think that's the word.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_06
 They don't support the team working together.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_06
 They're still very individual tools.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, sort of taking upon that idea, the way I see this is that it's the structure in which we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the principle of teamwork because the tasks were sort of divided and then the work went on in isolation.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what you guys did while you were together.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe that was different.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_03
 They don't find it.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_03
 But actually, if you imagine not entirely completely same task given to us, but us said, okay, first thing we have to do is come up with, let's say, a design concept and we sit here together and do it.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that's what teamwork is, to say, okay, go off and don't talk to each other.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_03
 It actually sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_03
 Not that we haven't done, I think, the best we could have done.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_03
 I'm satisfied with it.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_01
 Anything else?

0:31:25	SPEAKER_01
 Teamwork tool?

0:31:26	SPEAKER_01
 No, okay.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_01
 What about the, you know, how we use the whiteboard, the digital pens, the projector, stuff like that.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_01
 And did anybody think anything was really useful?

0:31:38	SPEAKER_01
 Anything was pretty un-

0:31:41	SPEAKER_03
 I think the whiteboard, for me, is the kind of thing I would use all the time, but it's not quite as useful to us as it could have been. Maybe just in the way that we use it in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings, that could have been up on a board, you know, opposed to in like, in text.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_03
 And then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_03
 I know that people who design cars and, you know, in aviation, they quite often just have a simple, like, fiberglass prototype and it's completely, you know, abstract from the final product, but they use it as a kind of a product.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_03
 And so we're just, we're actually just, each of us discussing something in each of our own minds.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_03
 It wasn't until we had this year, you know, like at one point, I peaked across and looked at Craig's paper and I'm like, now I know what he's thinking because I saw his book.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_03
 But the, the whiteboard could have actually been this kind of continuing.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_03
 So do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process would have been a good idea.

0:32:49	SPEAKER_06
 I think the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the, to the whiteboard.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_06
 And I think that that is also does.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_06
 The PowerPoint or maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPoint in the same place.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_03
 Because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_03
 Whereas I can imagine if I've been encouraged to use paintbrush, for example, or whatever, I would have actually used it.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_03
 Just because that's sort of how we were set up to you go.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_01
 Too many PowerPoint.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_06
 The plugin and the plugging spent, we spent a lot of time doing that and a lot of information on the PowerPoint.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_06
 I don't think, you know, we need it to actually, it could have, we could have gone through them very verbally, especially my slides.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_06
 I felt that, you know, as opposed to having to present them.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_01
 What about the digital pens?

0:33:49	SPEAKER_01
 Did you find them easy enough to use?

0:33:52	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_06
 Conkey.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_06
 Agreed.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_06
 Having to take it before you go off was a bit hindering as well.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_06
 Because you're halfway through a thought and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_01
 I know I think at the very start of today, I like wrote a whole load of stuff.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_01
 Didn't click note on one.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_01
 Then went back and wrote one tiny thing on the another page.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_01
 But then did click note.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm quite worried that I've just written over the top of it or something, but they'll have my paper anyway.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_01
 And I haven't done that.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_06
 I think the pen is very intuitive.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_06
 Everybody knows how to use it.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_06
 You don't have to worry.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_06
 I think the pen is good.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_06
 It's one of the best things.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_03
 On the topic of the technology, it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_00
 It just occurred to me that.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_03
 We only needed one computer.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_03
 We only actually needed one computer.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_06
 There had been a fifth that could have just been sitting there ready to go.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_06
 And the computer may not be conducive to a meeting because you tend to look at your computer and want to have the urge to check something.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_01
 It's useful.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_01
 But do you think the computers just provide distraction in the meeting?

0:35:04	SPEAKER_06
 I think too many computers are just distracting.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_01
 And I like to have things written down in front of me actually.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_01
 Like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_01
 I ended up being like riding down there or something.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_01
 So I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_01
 And I'll buy any videos.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_01
 What else?

0:35:28	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not really sure what they're looking for in the same new ideas.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_01
 Can you think of that?

0:35:36	SPEAKER_01
 Anything else that would have been helpful today at all?

0:35:40	SPEAKER_03
 The main one for me is that the process and the natural context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_03
 That's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea while you make it.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_03
 It's kind of hard to keep working forward on a team-based project when you're told you must now work away from the team.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_01
 And my experience of meetings is that they really do.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's been a lot of time to talk about the only thing is that when we had our meeting about the conceptual design, I thought maybe another 15 minutes would have been useful there.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_01
 I think maybe if we all have been working in the one room and they just said, you know, like, every hour or something, everybody makes sure you just have a short meeting and just to have something written down, just like, you know, a milestone if you like.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not having meetings, but there you go.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_01
 So, in closing, I haven't got my five minutes to go.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, there it is.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_01
 Five minutes to go.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_01
 Wonderful.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_01
 Are the courses in the budget?

0:37:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, they are.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_01
 And is the project evaluated?

0:37:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, it is.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_01
 So, I celebrate.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_06
 So, we have Ninja Homo.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_06
 So, no, yeah.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_01
 Well, apparently, now I write the final report.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_03
 What are you guys doing now?

0:37:22	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, wow.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_03
 That is lovely.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_01
 I said Ninja Homo.

0:37:27	SPEAKER_02
 What did you call it?

0:37:30	SPEAKER_06
 Ninja Homo.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_06
 See, it looks like Homer Simpson.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_06
 So, is that the Stilogu or is it doing a thing?

0:37:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's just the logo.

0:37:39	SPEAKER_01
 Just the logo and then, like, Ninja Homo.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_01
 Right, okay.

0:37:42	SPEAKER_06
 The red is supposed to represent the whatever else you want to print on the side of it.

0:37:49	SPEAKER_06
 It's crashing technology or something.

0:37:53	SPEAKER_06
 You can throw Homer when you're frustrated.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_01
 It's cool.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_01
 I'm kind of slightly gutted that we couldn't get Plastigand rubber.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_01
 I think that would have been nice.

0:38:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, well, maybe for now on real reactions, you should give us more money.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, I did learn something.

0:38:11	SPEAKER_06
 Plato is useful.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_06
 No, it is.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_06
 It is useful in conceptualizing, in being more interested.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_06
 It's like you say it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, the sense where we were playing with the Plato and the ideas came with the Plato rather than with everything else.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_06
 You might want to write that.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_06
 No.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_06
 I'm just filling with the Plato.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:33	SPEAKER_02
 It's not true.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_02
 I forgot how you just did a smile.

0:38:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's not funny, doesn't it?

0:38:37	SPEAKER_01
 The Plato's are actually edible, aren't they?

0:38:40	SPEAKER_01
 The whole Plato is in the Gulf, Montauk.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_01
 It's just sweet.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_06
 It's the stuff that your mom could make with preservedism.

0:38:46	SPEAKER_01
 And so what are your summarizing words about Plato?

0:38:50	SPEAKER_06
 It's helpful to the creative process.

0:38:53	SPEAKER_06
 It engages all your senses, not just your sight, but your sense of feel, your sense of touch, and it helps you to understand the dimension as well.

0:39:02	SPEAKER_06
 I think that's very helpful because it's such to pop up where it's on a piece of paper on a computer on a board.

0:39:08	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:39:09	SPEAKER_06
 Even with a treaty graphic thing, it still requires a lot of time.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:39:14	SPEAKER_06
 It's tangible.

0:39:16	SPEAKER_06
 It becomes tangible.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_01
 It's tangible.

0:39:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:39:24	SPEAKER_01
 Er...

0:39:32	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if there's anything else.

0:39:34	SPEAKER_01
 Nope.

0:39:35	SPEAKER_01
 I need to discuss.

0:39:37	SPEAKER_01
 I'll pass the board up really.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_03
 Do we retreat to our...

0:39:46	SPEAKER_06
 I think we could probably do it here as long as we do it.

0:39:50	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sure that the thing will pop up any minute now.

0:39:55	SPEAKER_06
 Can we turn off the microphones?

0:39:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:39:59	SPEAKER_01
 The meeting's over.

0:40:01	SPEAKER_06
 And my microphone has no signal.

0:40:05	None
 Which would explain why you don't get into the sound.

0:40:10	None
 Yeah.

0:40:13	SPEAKER_02
 Might be because of the power storm.

0:40:18	SPEAKER_03
 I think the time has to run out first to get any more instructions.

0:40:23	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:40:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:40:48	SPEAKER_03
 That's really cool.

0:40:49	SPEAKER_03
 I can see the...

0:40:51	SPEAKER_03
 I can see my own voice.

0:40:54	SPEAKER_03
 You really want...

0:41:54	None
 I can see my own voice.

0:42:24	None
 You can see my own voice.

0:42:54	None
 You can see my own voice.

0:43:24	None
 You can see my own voice.

0:43:28	None
 You can see my own voice.

0:43:36	None
 You can see my own voice.
