0:00:52	SPEAKER_01
 Huwwwwwwww...

0:00:58	SPEAKER_01
 a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_01
 So I want to introduce first of all the names and the colleagues here and what you are doing.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_02
 Sure, my name is Agnes and I'm a user usability user interface designer.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_00
 My name is Ed and I do accounting.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_01
 How you spell your name?

0:01:29	SPEAKER_01
 ED.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_01
 ED, okay.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_03
 Do you also do marketing?

0:01:36	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_01
 So only accounting.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_00
 Accounting, yes.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_03
 And I'm Christine and my role in this scenario is to be the industrial designer.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_01
 So who is marketing?

0:01:51	SPEAKER_03
 Marketing is me.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_00
 So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all and we have a long time, just 25 minutes,

0:02:01	SPEAKER_01
 to discuss about this project and the project initiation. First of all, I want to ask Mr. Ed about your marketing plan and your product plan.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_01
 I think we will see that throughout the day and how we are going to put this together as a marketing

0:02:27	SPEAKER_00
 to market the product. We will have to see through discussion on where we are going to go from here and from with us.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_01
 But do you already have a functional design or technical design?

0:02:41	SPEAKER_01
 For the moment.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_01
 Not yet.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_01
 But what do you have some project plan?

0:02:49	SPEAKER_01
 Something or?

0:02:51	SPEAKER_00
 Good question.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_00
 Now this is like I said, we have to be discussed between all of us and we will go from there.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_00
 We have to, we have to work on it together.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_01
 So by when you think you can give me some kind of project plan, discussion will be discussed.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_01
 Certainly by the next meeting.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_01
 By next meeting, it will be great.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_01
 So does any question for Mr. Fawar about this project?

0:03:27	SPEAKER_03
 Where is the goal of the project?

0:03:29	SPEAKER_01
 The goal of the project, I think maybe I will hand out to the 8.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_01
 Explain the project, the geese and the sales and the echo.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_00
 I am in the sale, I was explaining what the, we have to define exactly what our product is from.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, so can you explain what exactly the product is?

0:03:51	SPEAKER_00
 From what I had in mind, we were supposed to be marketing coffee.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_00
 Is that right?

0:03:57	SPEAKER_01
 I think if I am not wrong, we are making the remote control.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_01
 Remote control, because I had two different things.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_00
 I have the first part of mine was to make a remote control for new remote control for television.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_00
 And after I had a discussion about coffee, so we will start with the remote control for television then.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to design something that is very user friendly.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_00
 Something visually has something that will draw people to buy the product.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_00
 Because I think everybody is experienced with remote controls and some remote controls are worth throwing out the window.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_00
 Most of them, I don't know, we have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_00
 That's a lot of times spend half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_01
 And what about your industrial design plan?

0:04:59	SPEAKER_01
 All you have a design already on this product or you are still working on the design?

0:05:07	SPEAKER_03
 No, I have not begun working on the design.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_03
 I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_03
 I thought we were designing a new monitor.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_03
 The website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a seven inch monitor.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_03
 And I understood that that was the project goal.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_03
 I'm glad I didn't do any work ahead of time because I clearly didn't understand the project goal.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_03
 I just did see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team, composed of these people.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_03
 That's about, and I read through the different steps and what my responsibilities were relative to those steps.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_01
 So you will be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team for the design?

0:06:09	SPEAKER_03
 For the industrial design?

0:06:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I think that depends on how much money he gives us.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_03
 Because you know, he can make it...

0:06:23	SPEAKER_03
 You have different choices with different financial models.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_01
 But before we talk about the finance, do you have some idea how we can sell this product or project in the market?

0:06:35	SPEAKER_01
 And how much is going to benefit to the company and of course it's to the individual also?

0:06:43	SPEAKER_03
 You know, I kind of think that in general you have to do... you have to have something that's very fashionable.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_03
 That's a very attractive that people see and recognize its goal and they immediately want to have it have one of their own.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_03
 So I think that you need to... something like the iPod would be good, seems to have caught on fairly well.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_03
 So you know, I don't care what it does, just so it looks cool.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_01
 But when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design?

0:07:27	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_03
 And so I'll have to wait and see how those go.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_03
 If they go quickly then it could be a month.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_03
 If I run into any problems in my other projects, it might be six months.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but I need something in the writing.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_01
 So like what's your functional design, what's your technical design?

0:07:51	SPEAKER_01
 And how many people you need for this project? And what's the time frame you're looking?

0:07:55	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. And what is the budget? Maybe the initial budget you're looking.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. And how is going to the market? Okay. So you have to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_01
 And what are the marketing strategy plan? Okay.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_01
 And now you're going to introduce. Okay. And by the time you introduce the product and you know there will be a competition.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. So I need some kind of the plan in the writing from you. Okay.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_01
 And what would you like that?

0:08:23	SPEAKER_01
 As soon as possible.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_03
 Well, if we have enough time, then do you think two weeks is close enough?

0:08:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I think that would be good because I need to go to the management and tell them what we are going to do.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_01
 And what's cost-stress, okay. And what's the time frame and what's the project plan?

0:08:47	SPEAKER_01
 Because without any documentation, so I cannot go to the management and say, we are going to do this and we need this much money. Okay. So then it's difficult for me to say. Okay.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 That's the reason I need some kind of plan from you initially. Okay.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 Then we can have the further discussion again.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_03
 Are there other people who will be contributing to the plan?

0:09:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, of course. If you did some help, so let me know.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_01
 So for the people you need from the marketing or the technical side or the administration point of you, to add in any documentation or some technical point of view.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_01
 So just let me know so I can coordinate all the teams. Okay. Get back to you on that.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_01
 And Ed, so what do you think about this project for the remote control?

0:09:35	SPEAKER_01
 And do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or the sales strategy?

0:09:41	SPEAKER_00
 Well, not yet. I've been doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do with their building, their designs, their ideas.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_00
 I also have to pinpoint which market we're going to go into.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_00
 This should be a fairly large market because there are a number of people that the competition.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_00
 I agree. It has to be something new.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_00
 It has to be something that draws people saying, hey, I like this.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_00
 Whether it works or not, they have to first say, I like this. I like the design.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_00
 And then it's got to be simple to use.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yes. So what I prefer, maybe you need to interact more with the Christine.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_01
 Because you know what she's going to do it.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_01
 And you know how to sell it.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_01
 Because she's doing the design, but you're the core because you're in the marketing.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_01
 Because you need to sell it and you're responsible for all the money, the finance to more.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_01
 So what I prefer, you need to interact with the Christine more.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_01
 And within her team who is doing the functional design or technical design.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_01
 You need to come up with some kind of plan. How are we going to do the sales plan?

0:10:55	SPEAKER_00
 We already have a cost limit on this.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_00
 The idea of how much we want to market this for. How much is it going to sell for?

0:11:03	SPEAKER_01
 That's the best of us to decide.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_01
 So the best thing is you both of the Christine and you discuss with yourself.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_01
 And come up with the cost and how we are going to compete in the market.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_01
 In the technically or in the sales wise, the commercial wise.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_01
 Then we have to design how long it will take the whole project.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_01
 How much is going to cost us and how much we are going to benefit for the company.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_01
 Of course, it's a benefit for everybody individual.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_01
 So I think it's maybe if you can give me some kind of your the sales plan.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_01
 Including the technical what she's going to talk to you within the team.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_01
 Then it will help me to discuss with the management for further and put it in the proper project plan.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_01
 If you need any coordination in between, compared to some technical vendors or commercial vendors.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_01
 If you want to have some marketing plan or technical plan, so let me know.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_01
 I can coordinate. Or maybe you have my coordinate.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_02
 Well, no, not exactly. My job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_02
 And make sure that the product is usable.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_02
 It's acceptable to the people who are going to use it and look at the best ways to do that.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_02
 So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_02
 So that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_02
 And so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in, but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_01
 So basically you need to interact with Christine more for the user acceptability and the testing.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_02
 Which will also feed into the marketing because depending on what users want depends on how you sell it, what tag lines you attach to it, how you try to make it more attractive to you.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_02
 So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_02
 And then I guess build the plan based on all of that.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_02
 Because I think you need to take all the factors into account.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_01
 But what I request, okay, the keep add in the loop.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, of course.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_01
 You were meeting and Christine meeting because he should know what's happening.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we can see him on any discussions or documents that are passed out.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_01
 So all the discussions to me, okay, I need to submit to the management.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_02
 No problem.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_01
 So any questions for time being?

0:13:54	SPEAKER_02
 So the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_01
 So come up with the functional design and to discuss with add, okay, how it's going to be work.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_01
 And first of all, with your user acceptance, okay, how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_01
 So then we can discuss about further things.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll meet where the will discuss on the further meeting.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 Thanks for coming.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_03
 Would you mind at the conclusion of our meeting, could you send us a copy of your slides?

0:14:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_01
 I would.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that would be a secret.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_01
 I'll copy.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_01
 Let us keep all the emails and all the copies.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_01
 So, we share each other.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_01
 So you know everybody what's happening.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:14:45	None

0:14:46	SPEAKER_01

0:14:48	SPEAKER_01
