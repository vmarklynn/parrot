0:00:30	SPEAKER_03
 Oops.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_03
 That's as far as it goes.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_01
 Hi, guys. Good morning, everybody here.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_01
 And I want to introduce myself.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_01
 My name is Shridha Dalsari, and I'm a project manager for this new project, which we are going to discuss now.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_01
 So I want to introduce first of all the names and the colleagues here.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_01
 And what you're doing.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_02
 Sure. My name is Agnes, and I'm an usability user interface designer.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_00
 My name is Ed, and I do accounting.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_01
 How do you spell your name?

0:01:31	SPEAKER_01
 Ed. Ed, okay.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_03
 Do you also do marketing?

0:01:37	SPEAKER_01
 No. So only accounting.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_00
 Accounting, yes.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_03
 And I'm Christine, and my role in this scenario is to be the industrial designer.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_01
 But I'm not really one.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_01
 So who is marketing?

0:01:57	SPEAKER_00
 Marketing is me.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_01
 So thanks for coming for the meeting, first of all.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_01
 And we have a long time, just 25 minutes to discuss about this project and the project initiation.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_01
 First of all, I want to ask Mr. Ed about your marketing plan and your product plan.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_01
 And...

0:02:24	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I think we'll see that throughout the day, and how we're going to put this together as a marketing to market the product.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_00
 We'll have to see through discussion on where we're going to go from here and from with us.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_01
 But we already have like a functional design or technical design.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_01
 For the moment, not yet.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_01
 But what's your... do you have some project plan?

0:02:49	SPEAKER_01
 Something for...

0:02:51	SPEAKER_00
 Good question.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_00
 Now this is like I said, we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_00
 We'll have to...

0:02:58	SPEAKER_00
 We'll have to...

0:02:59	SPEAKER_00
 We'll have to work on together.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. So by when you think, you can give me some kind of project plan.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, discussion meeting.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_01
 Certainly by the next meeting.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, that would be great.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_01
 So, there's any questions for the first of all about this project?

0:03:26	SPEAKER_03
 Where's the goal of the project?

0:03:28	SPEAKER_01
 The goal of the project, I think maybe I'll hand out to the Ed.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_01
 I'm in the sales, I'm supposed to explain to you what...

0:03:41	SPEAKER_00
 We have to define exactly what our project is from...

0:03:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yes. Can you explain what exactly the product is?

0:03:51	SPEAKER_00
 From what I had in mind, we're supposed to be marketing coffee. Is that right?

0:03:57	SPEAKER_01
 I think...

0:03:59	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure we're making the remote control.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_00
 Remote control, because I had two different things.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_00
 I have the first part of mind was to make a remote control for new remote control for television.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_00
 And afterward I had a discussion about coffee, so...

0:04:14	SPEAKER_00
 We'll start with the remote control for television then.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to design something that is very user friendly.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_00
 Something...

0:04:24	SPEAKER_00
 Visually it has something that will draw people to buy the product.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_00
 Because I think everybody's experienced with remote controls and some remote controls or are worth throwing out the window.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_00
 Most of them... I don't know, we have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_00
 Because a lot of times it's been half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_01
 And what about your industrial design plan?

0:05:00	SPEAKER_01
 Or do you have a design already on this product or are you still working on the design?

0:05:07	SPEAKER_03
 No, I have not begun working on the design.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_03
 And I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_03
 I thought we were designing a new monitor.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_03
 The website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of some sort of a 7-inch monitor.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_03
 And I understood that that was the project goal.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm glad I didn't do any work ahead of time because I clearly didn't understand the project goal.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_03
 I just did see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four-member team composed of these people.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_03
 And that's about... I read through the different steps and what my responsibilities were relative to those steps.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_01
 So you will be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team for the design?

0:06:10	SPEAKER_03
 For the industrial design?

0:06:12	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I think that depends on how much money you give us.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_03
 Because you know, you can make it... you have different choices with different financial models.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but before we talk about the finance, okay, do you have some idea how we can sell this product or project in the market?

0:06:35	SPEAKER_01
 And how much is going to benefit to the company and of course it's to the individual also?

0:06:43	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you know, I kind of think that in general you have to do... you have to have something that's very fashionable, that's very attractive that people see and recognize its goal and they immediately want to have it have one of their own.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_03
 So it really would need to... something like the iPod would be good, seems to have caught on fairly well.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_03
 So, you know, I don't care what it does, just so it looks cool.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, but when you think you can give me like a kind of design or the functional design or the technical design?

0:07:27	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now and so I'll have to wait and see how those go.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_03
 If they go quickly, then it could be a month.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_03
 If I run into any problems on my other projects, it might be six months.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but I need something in the writing.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_01
 So like, what's your functional design? What's your technical design?

0:07:50	SPEAKER_01
 And how many people you need for this project?

0:07:53	SPEAKER_01
 And what's the timeframe you're looking? And what is the budget? Maybe the initial budget you're looking?

0:07:59	SPEAKER_01
 And how is it going to the market? So you have to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what is the marketing strategy plan?

0:08:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, when are you going to introduce? And by the time you introduce the product and there will be a competition.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_01
 So I need some kind of the plan in the writing from you.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, and where would you like that?

0:08:24	SPEAKER_01
 As soon as possible.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_03
 Well, if we have enough time, then do you think two weeks is close enough?

0:08:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I think that would be good because I need to go to the management and tell them what we are going to do and what's cost stress, okay, and what's the timeframe and what's the project plan?

0:08:47	SPEAKER_01
 Because without any documentation, so I cannot go to the management and say, okay, we are going to do this and we need this much money.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so then it's difficult for me to say, okay, that's the reason I need some kind of plan from you initially.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, then we can have the further discussion again.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_03
 Are there other people who will be contributing to the plan?

0:09:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, of course, if you did some help, so let me know. So for the people you need from the marketing or the technical side or the administration point of view, okay, to add in any documentation or some technical point of view.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_01
 So just let me know so I can coordinate all the teams.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, I'll get back to you on that.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_01
 And Ed, so what do you think about this project for the remote control?

0:09:36	SPEAKER_01
 Do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or the sales strategy?

0:09:41	SPEAKER_00
 Well, not yet other than doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do with their building, their designs, their ideas.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_00
 I also have to pinpoint which market we're going to go into.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_00
 This should be a fairly large market because the number of people that the competition.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_00
 I agree, it has to be something new. It has to be something that draws people saying, hey, I like this.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_00
 Whether it works or not, it'll have the first say, I like this, I like the design.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_00
 And then it's going to be simple to use.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yes. So what I prefer, maybe you need to interact more with the Christine, okay, because you know what she's going to do it.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_01
 And you know how to sell it.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. Because she's doing the design, but you're the core because you're on the marketing.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. So you need to sell any, you're the responsible for all the money, the finance.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_01
 Tomorrow. So what I prefer, okay. So you need to interact with the Christine more and within her team, okay, who is using the functional design or technical design.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. And you need to come up with some kind of plan. Okay. How we are going to do the your sales plan.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. Do we already have a cost limit on this? An idea of how much we want to market this for? How much is it going to sell for?

0:11:02	SPEAKER_00
 That's a test up to us to decide. Yes.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_01
 That's how to decide. Okay. So the best thing is you both of the Christine and you discussed with yourself. Okay.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_01
 And come up with the cost and how we are going to compete in the market, okay, in the technically or in the sales wise, okay, the commercial wise.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. Then we have to design, okay, how long it will take the whole project. Okay.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_01
 How much is going to cost us and how much we are going to benefit for the company. Okay.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_01
 Of course, it's, it's a benefit for everybody individual. Okay.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_01
 So I think it's maybe if you can give me some kind of your, the sales plan. Okay.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_01
 Including the technical what she's going to talk to you within the team. Okay.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_01
 Then it will help me to discuss with the management for further, okay, and put it in the, the proper project plan.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_01
 And if you need any coordination in between, compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors. Okay.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_01
 Depends if you want to have some marketing plan or technical plan. Okay. So you let me know. Okay.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_01
 I can coordinate or maybe you have my coordinate. Right. Mm. Between all the.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_02
 Well, no, not exactly. I mean, my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_02
 It's acceptable to the people who are going to use it and look at the best ways to do that. Yeah.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_02
 So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her. Yeah.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_02
 So that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_02
 And so it's sort of, it's a loop that feeds in, but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. So basically you need to interact with Christine more, okay, for the user acceptability. Yeah.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. And the testing. Okay. Then. Which will also feed into the marketing because depending on what users want depends on how you sell it, what taglines you attach to it, how you try to make it more attractive to users.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_02
 So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_02
 And then I guess build the plan based on all of that because I think you need to take all the factors into account.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_01
 But what are requests? Okay. Keep adding the loop. Yeah, of course.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_01
 You're meeting and Christine meeting because he should know what's happening.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we can see him on any discussions or documents that are passed around.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. All the discussions to me. Okay. Sure. I need to submit to the management. No problem.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 So any questions for time being?

0:13:54	SPEAKER_02
 So the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design. Yes.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_01
 So come up with the functional design and to discuss with Ed, okay, how it's going to work.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_01
 And first of all, with your user acceptance, okay, how it looks like and how it's going to work in the market.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. So then we can discuss about further things. Okay.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll meet when the we'll just on the further meeting.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. Thanks for coming. Would you mind at the conclusion of our meeting? Could you send us a copy of your slides?

0:14:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yes. Yeah. That would be useful. Yes. I'll copy.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_01
 Let us keep all the emails and all the copies so we can share each other. Okay.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_01
 So you know everybody what's happening. Sure. Okay.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_01
 And if anything you need anytime. So please either you can call me or just send me email or just come and knock my door. Okay. So I'm available here.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thanks for coming and I wish you a nice time then. Thank you. See you later.

0:15:26	None
 Thank you.

0:15:33	None
 Okay.
