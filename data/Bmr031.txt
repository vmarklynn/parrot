0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, we're on.

0:00:02	SPEAKER_01
 See, there are some stretches that weren't there.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_01
 Right, it would have to be here.

0:00:06	SPEAKER_05
 What do you have to do about that, so?

0:00:08	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I have a person would check it over and then give it final.

0:00:12	SPEAKER_05
 The poster?

0:00:14	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, wait, for Jack.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_07
 Close the door.

0:00:18	SPEAKER_08
 Well, it's more...

0:00:20	SPEAKER_08
 We're recording, by the way, this way.

0:00:22	SPEAKER_05
 You can keep talking.

0:00:24	SPEAKER_02
 You keep talking. I just should be aware.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_02
 You are saying that we have a project for Jack's way.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_02
 So, the start and I said, okay.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_08
 So, the compromise is we're starting, but we're leaving the door open.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_08
 Okay. So, a little more background noise.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_02
 And...

0:00:38	SPEAKER_02
 That way, we can close the door, make Chuck knock when he comes.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I tend to...

0:00:44	SPEAKER_04
 There are a couple of meetings where there are a lot of pre-ambles like this.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_04
 And which creates the transcription doesn't start until someone actually says, okay.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_04
 Really?

0:00:51	SPEAKER_08
 So, we're starting right now.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, oh, yeah. The meeting started.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_08
 This is the real thing.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_08
 There's Chuck just kidding.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_08
 It was. Okay.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_08
 You said Chuck gets stuck with the earplug mic.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_08
 Okay. Last guy in.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_08
 I just get the door.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_08
 You just get the door.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, so I had him sit around this thing about what we were going to talk about.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_08
 And we had this discussion of flipping back and forth between an emphasis on the technology, particularly recognition versus the recordings and transcriptions and so on.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_08
 But I was asking if we could to kind of make it just whatever is happening, rather than one or the other, because next week I'll be at a meeting on campus, and after that I'll be in New York for several meetings worth.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_08
 You folks will be going for a couple of the meetings worth.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_05
 I know that happens back to us the times here at Gone.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_05
 Really? Okay. Yeah.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_08
 So...

0:01:46	SPEAKER_08
 So, you didn't get an agenda, I guess we had the usual.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_02
 Well, because no one, no one ever responded to any items.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_02
 So I have a couple of minor ones.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_02
 Our normal transcription status, just so that we can make some plans.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_03
 So what's up with IBM, Chuck? Do you know?

0:02:08	SPEAKER_03
 I think Brian is on vacation now, but before he left, we gave him another meeting

0:02:14	SPEAKER_07
 to give to the trans fibers. How many? Is yours working there, Chuck?

0:02:18	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. Your P? What am I?

0:02:22	SPEAKER_04
 Is it turned on?

0:02:24	SPEAKER_02
 There's no on. Okay.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's just...

0:02:28	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, let me raise the gain on that a little bit, since it's so far from your mouth.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_07
 Sorry.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_08
 Okay. So we sent them...

0:02:40	SPEAKER_03
 We gave them four meetings before he left, and that's it.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. I don't think we'll hear from him before he gets back.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_03
 Do I know about your pie chart?

0:02:50	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_09
 Or pie chart?

0:02:54	SPEAKER_04
 He has a nice pie chart on the current status page, which shows the amount of data that have been transcribed and the amount of the entire.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_04
 And at this point, it's not quite half.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_04
 Is that what you say with the pie chart?

0:03:10	SPEAKER_04
 And then of that, there's a little slower I could try and draw it, but probably better describe it.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_08
 Half the data it's been recorded has been transcribed?

0:03:16	SPEAKER_04
 Roughly, almost.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_04
 Wow.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_04
 And I haven't actually caught up with, since I got back so recently for my vacation, I know that the transcribers finished several meetings while I was gone.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_04
 Oh. And I haven't told you because I haven't figured out which ones they are, or yet, but when that happens, then that pie will get even closer to the midline.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_04
 It's not quite... not quite a 2%, but really getting close.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so also...

0:03:40	SPEAKER_02
 Pie will be close to one now.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_11
 Well, it's a straight match.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_08
 Well, if we can have 3.14 times as much transcribed as we recorded, we really will be doing that.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_04
 But it's so nice. I recommend this is graphic, because it's so much...

0:03:56	SPEAKER_02
 How much do we need transcribed before it's worth doing some trainings?

0:04:00	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, it seems like probably we have enough now, right?

0:04:06	SPEAKER_02
 Because like, like, Macrophone wasn't that much data, right?

0:04:10	SPEAKER_01
 And it helped.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we already used the Predicted training.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_02
 You only used that for digits, right?

0:04:16	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we did do some training out of digits.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_01
 Rather adaptation of digits.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, supervised adaptation.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I mean...

0:04:24	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe like 20 hours we could try, but maybe not counting the non-native speech, because that just doesn't translate very well.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_01
 I would love to do some...

0:04:36	SPEAKER_01
 With adaptation, you can use fairly small amount of data to improve your performance.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_01
 And, you know, it's just basically...

0:04:50	SPEAKER_01
 I don't have time to do too much these days, except what I'm already doing.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_01
 But if there's someone who has some free time, I'll be happy to show them how it works.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_01
 Can you play with it?

0:05:05	SPEAKER_08
 I thought you were already using adaptation.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_01
 That's supervised adaptation.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_01
 So we're doing some unsupervised speaker adaptation.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_01
 I see.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_01
 But you could build a set which you sort of take your models and do supervised adaptation.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_01
 And then start with the speaker adaptation from sort of channel adapted for room adapted or whatever.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_02
 How would you imagine doing a test set on this corpus?

0:05:29	SPEAKER_02
 A test set training set division.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, it's really weird, right?

0:05:33	SPEAKER_02
 Because it would be hard to get speaker disjoint sets.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_02
 Really?

0:05:37	SPEAKER_05
 Do we just give up on that?

0:05:39	SPEAKER_05
 And actually, I was thinking about this.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_05
 The original application doesn't really...

0:05:43	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, if you're using this over and over again, you're going to be testing on the same...

0:05:47	SPEAKER_05
 the same speakers.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_02
 No, but then you have the supervised versus unsupervised question.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_05
 I just mean that it's not a terrible thing to assume that you don't...

0:05:57	SPEAKER_05
 that you don't have disjoint sets.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:06:03	SPEAKER_05
 For this particular kind of...

0:06:05	SPEAKER_08
 Right.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_08
 I mean, you could have some parts of it that are disjoint and some that aren't.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_01
 It's sort of like in broadcast news.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_01
 Because you have those people who re-occur.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_01
 Over and over.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, the anchor speakers.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, as long as you were aware that you're doing that, that's...

0:06:27	SPEAKER_01
 You can celebrate it out.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_02
 And similarly with subject matter.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_02
 That, you know, if you're training your language model on this meeting only and testing on this meeting only, you're going to do a lot better than if you start crossing them.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_05
 Somewhat, although what's interesting is that the majority of the words in the language model are actually...

0:06:45	SPEAKER_05
 On the same.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, they're actually just like function words and...

0:06:49	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_05
 And there's a lot of speaker dependence there.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_05
 Even the transcribers will say they know who the speakers after a while just from there.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_05
 Just from a word choice.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_05
 So, I don't think you're talking the way you're right.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_02
 Well, certainly.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_02
 So, it's just that...

0:07:09	SPEAKER_02
 If we're going to do that, we should give some thought to how we want to divide it up.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, so maybe someone else would do a lot of the work with probably your advice.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, would be.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_02
 So, with digits, we now have a lot of digits, but most of them aren't transcribed.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_02
 So, if we want to do a forced alignment on them, we could start collecting ourselves up a fairly large digit corpus.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. That's the same issue.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_08
 We want to do that for sure.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_02
 Someone who's interested in that to start looking at it.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_02
 So, who's working on digits currently?

0:07:39	SPEAKER_02
 Dave Gilbert.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe I'll talk to him and see if he's interested.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_02
 Not right away.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, sure.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_08
 One thing, just an announcement of the source is that Chuck is going to be going to a meeting at NIST in about a month and a half, I guess, they're still working out the date.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_08
 Because they want to gather together sort of one person from each site who is involved in the meeting stuff since they're going to be doing a bunch of meeting recordings there.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_08
 And so...

0:08:17	SPEAKER_02
 Are the CMU folks going to be there?

0:08:19	SPEAKER_08
 Somebody has like one person.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_08
 The moment it's one person from each site, so there'll be somebody from CMU and somebody from here and somebody from...

0:08:27	SPEAKER_08
 Number of places, probably somebody from UW.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_08
 So...

0:08:33	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, it's possible they're opening up to more people, but I think the main thing is just...

0:08:37	SPEAKER_08
 It's not a conference.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_08
 It's not a workshop really.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_08
 It's just connecting with them.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_08
 So...

0:08:45	SPEAKER_08
 So then if they start a bunch of recordings, then ultimately they'll have training sets and test sets and all that stuff.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_01
 But it would be interesting to hear what they intend to do about speaker over that first.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_05
 What's the plan if we're...

0:09:07	SPEAKER_05
 We're transcribing data and what happens if they don't deliver things until next year or something like that?

0:09:15	SPEAKER_05
 That's resource here.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_08
 Well, again, the hope is that...

0:09:21	SPEAKER_08
 I mean, it's looking...

0:09:23	SPEAKER_08
 I mean, I have to ask these folks, but my impression is that the IBM path is looking more promising.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah. And if that's the case, and if it turns out that it's really a relatively small amount of time for our transcribers to process things before and after, if they really have taken out enough of the work that it's feasible, then maybe we can do it with a smaller staff next year.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_08
 I mean, next year in which he's referring to us, next year we don't have a whole lot of guaranteed funding for this work.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_08
 Other funding may come.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_08
 But if we want to just count on what we know about, it's more modest than this year.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_08
 There's still be money, but it's just more modest.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_08
 So I would see us as probably not doing more recordings, at least for meetings or digits or anything.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_08
 But if we feel we need to probably still do some recordings for smart com or something.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_08
 But otherwise, just stop that and just take whatever comes from the other places, which I guess we have an unknown rate.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_08
 If it starts being, their generating is huge amount, we can't handle it, then we'll tell them.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_08
 But although it would have been nice if that their stuff had come earlier, it's some ways a good thing because we've been earning out this path.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_02
 I got an email from one of the UW guys.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_02
 They want to record the meetings at higher sampling rate than 16 kilohertz.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't ask why, but it seems to me that really doesn't matter if they have the disk space to do it.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_02
 It seems that that is not a big deal.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_02
 I was just wondering if anyone had an opinion about mismatched?

0:11:23	SPEAKER_08
 Well, just if the rate's sending to us, then we have to have the disk space to do it too.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_04
 Can't we down sample?

0:11:31	SPEAKER_04
 That would be a whole bit.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_08
 Are they doing some nice integer multiple?

0:11:35	SPEAKER_08
 Excuse me?

0:11:36	SPEAKER_08
 Are they doing some nice integer multiple of the 16?

0:11:39	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, it was like 40-something, 44-42.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_08
 Oh, 44.1.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_08
 Something like that.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_08
 Oh, so that's...well, we record here at 48 or something, and then we down sample.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_05
 But it's 44 and 16 or not.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_05
 Well, you can do it.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_08
 No, I'm sorry, you can do it.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_08
 You can go from anything to anything else.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_05
 But it's just a little more complicated.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_05
 It's just a little bit more complicated.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_05
 It's just like...

0:12:10	SPEAKER_08
 It's just slightly more complicated, but you can go from any frequency to anything.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_02
 Well, the only thought was if we're going to do a combined corpus, does it really matter if some sample that won't rate in some sample that the other?

0:12:25	SPEAKER_02
 My feeling is no, it doesn't.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_02
 These days, audio tools tend to take care of all of that, but I just wanted to double check with other people before I told them, yeah, no problem.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_04
 Also, seems like the corpus could all be standardized on this...

0:12:39	SPEAKER_04
 That's why I was saying so.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_02
 Why are they asking us?

0:12:41	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't know.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_02
 Why are they asking us?

0:12:43	SPEAKER_02
 Because we're sort of doing the corpus, so they want to be as similar as possible.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_02
 I think the answer is if we tell him, no, that's not all right, what he'll probably say is what we're going to do in any way.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's the...

0:12:56	SPEAKER_01
 It would be interesting to find out why they're choosing the other sample.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_08
 Well, I would suspect this because it's what the hardware does.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, and they just don't want it down sample.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_01
 They're just deferring the problem to later, and they might say themselves a lot of this.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_01
 They can't participate.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_08
 I think it's the sort of thing that's deserving of discussion with them.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_08
 I don't think it's like...

0:13:17	SPEAKER_08
 They'll ask us, we'll give a simple answer and come back.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_08
 It needs them back and forth because it's a little gnarly to have parts of the database with different things.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_08
 And it's...

0:13:28	SPEAKER_08
 Part of the arguments for the higher sampling rate is that maybe there's something, you know, say, in 6 to 10 kilohertz that you might use for some purposes somewhere.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_08
 People are doing a wide range of things, doing location, doing a bunch of things.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_08
 Maybe, you know, why throw it away if you don't need to.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_08
 On the other hand, I mean...

0:13:50	SPEAKER_08
 It's...

0:13:52	SPEAKER_08
 16 kilohertz is plenty.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_08
 So I think it's...

0:13:59	SPEAKER_08
 And they are going to be using a ballad disk, both for them and for us when we're processing their stuff.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_01
 We should want them to use this space issues, like, going to creep up on them very fast.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it would be...

0:14:10	SPEAKER_08
 If they're going to creep up on you, you won't even creep.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_05
 As long as it's heavily like three people per meeting.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_05
 How many channels?

0:14:17	SPEAKER_05
 They can just limit the number of people.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_02
 I don't remember what their hardware set up was, but it was smaller than ours.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_08
 Well, that might help a bit.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, actually, I think at NIST, there was some discussion of fairly high sampling rates too.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_02
 Well, with NIST, I think they're in a different situation because they're doing video.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_02
 And so compared to the video, the audio was just noise in terms of disk space, literally.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_08
 I don't think that's true.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_08
 Really?

0:14:41	SPEAKER_08
 They're recording 50 channels or mics.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_02
 They're not recording all 50 of the array.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_02
 They're cooking the down, right?

0:14:48	SPEAKER_05
 They said they were going to record 50, but they were definitely above, like, 20.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_02
 That's funny.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_02
 I thought that they were cooking down that data.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think so for them.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_08
 They were storing it.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_08
 I don't think so.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_08
 No, so I think they have actually a very large audio data rate.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_08
 I think it is comparable to a video data rate.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_08
 So.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_03
 How many words are they going to ever distribute this?

0:15:10	SPEAKER_02
 They're not going to.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_08
 You're going to have to just get...

0:15:14	SPEAKER_08
 Interesting question.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_08
 Because you'll have to just work on little subsets of it.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_02
 There's just no way.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_03
 We're estimating that ours, if we collect, say, 100 meetings in each meeting, is just the audio compressed audio is half a gig.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_03
 So there's 50 gigs just for our corpus, for 100 meetings.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_03
 And that's no video.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_08
 16.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_03
 16.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_03
 And so...

0:15:38	SPEAKER_03
 You just get like...

0:15:39	SPEAKER_03
 Even the distribution of 20 gigs, you know, if you use DVDs or something, that's a lot.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_03
 It's still two or three DVDs.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_03
 And I feel it's to read the video also.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_03
 It's used both sides and the two layers.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's a lot more than that, right?

0:15:55	SPEAKER_02
 DVD is eight gigs.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_08
 Well, I think you also have interesting discussions next month when you go out there.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_08
 And how are they going to...

0:16:02	SPEAKER_08
 What's the distribution plan?

0:16:03	SPEAKER_08
 If they have something really smart in mind, then maybe we can use it.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_08
 I mean, we talked about sending around a disk or...

0:16:10	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's the right way to do it.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_02
 Someone sends us a disk.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_02
 We loaded it with data and send it back.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_02
 It's going to be easier than any other method.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_02
 Well, if you want to burn the CDs here, welcome to it.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_03
 We give it to LDC and let them do it.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, absolutely.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_02
 If they have a way to do it.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_02
 I'm thinking prior to that.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_05
 If there ever any talk of taking the closed talking mics when people aren't talking and deleting those portions, or is the bridge...

0:16:37	SPEAKER_02
 You already do that.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_02
 Shorten does that automatically.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_02
 That's why you...

0:16:40	SPEAKER_02
 That's why shorten...

0:16:41	SPEAKER_02
 That's why shorten reduces the size so much.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_08
 That's why it's only 50 gigs.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_05
 So it's really big, even if you're only one person or two people that most are actually talking all the time.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yep.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_05
 Wow.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_02
 Just talk less.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_02
 Well, if you talk less, it does, in fact, use less data.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_02
 So the channel...

0:17:01	SPEAKER_08
 The first time I ever heard you ask for less data.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_02
 It's actually one way to tell if a microphone is dead and bleeding, is if the short file is too short.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_02
 It's really short, then.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_02
 Then you can be pretty sure that the mic was off.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_11
 Okay.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_02
 And unfortunately, the tabletop ones, the six tabletop, which we record all the time, no matter how many people are there, don't compress nearly as well, because they almost always have signal on them.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's probably a lot of it.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_08
 And they're going to hit mics like that, too.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_08
 In fact, they're array.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_02
 They're array, we'll be.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_02
 So they want shorten nearly as well.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_02
 Wow.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_11
 And I assume they're going to do it lossless.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_01
 So they're really going to have a huge distribution purposes, might make sense to split it by channel, rather than by meetings.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_01
 So you could distribute, like, only the near field.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, absolutely.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_01
 Together for a bunch of meetings.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_02
 And then maybe one far field, you know, things or the mix channel.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_02
 I think there are a lot of ways to do it.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_02
 But let's not worry about that now.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_02
 Are we on disk space, Jack?

0:18:01	SPEAKER_03
 We're okay.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_03
 We've got, for the compressed meetings, we've still got about, I think it was four gigs, the one disk that we're using.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_03
 And we've got several, we still got quite a bit of space on the unbacked up.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_03
 So good.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_03
 But I think it's probably we should start thinking about where to go next, especially on the backed up disk space.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_08
 Now we bought, no, longer we bought three.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_08
 That's the unbacked.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_08
 36 gigabyte disks.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and we're using those for the poor, the expanded.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_03
 So for example, the Gunter's Wall Street Journal data went on to one of those.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_03
 Some other experiment things that people are doing are on there.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_03
 So if you put it there, people will use it.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_08
 So I think after that we need another rack or some servers.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_08
 Change servers?

0:18:54	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we could, we could, there are a bunch of disks that we have that are smaller and they're like 17, we could go to 35.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_03
 So we could get some extra space out of that.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_03
 But right now the server's full, we couldn't add any more disks.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_03
 We could change a smaller disk for a larger one.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_08
 We should probably do that while we have the space left on the existing disks.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the problem with that for backed up media is the Sysadmins want to keep them at 18 gig partitions because that takes up how to day to get off backup tape.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_03
 Well then there's the other issue is that to add more disk now, David says we really need to go to new servers.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_03
 But he wants to go to new servers, not just for us, but for other nodes too.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_03
 So there's this sort of coordination issue.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_03
 And I guess I need to talk to him more about it.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, going to bigger disks we can do even and just maintain the 18 gig partitions, just partition them into multiple.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_02
 So that's probably the next step is to get the 80 or 90 gig drives to replace the 30 gig we're in 18 gig that we have now.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_08
 There are 80 gig drives now, you can get that.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_08
 See that's probably what we should send around to for distribution.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_02
 This is a corpus.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_02
 That's a whole handful of micro drives.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_02
 Is the aerial density of the micro drive higher than if it were normal drive?

0:20:23	SPEAKER_02
 It must be.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_03
 When they come out with the 80 gig micro drive then we'll just send one of those little things with all the meeting days.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. Well they have the two gig already.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_02
 I'm just thinking 40 of them is probably still smaller in area than one normal size drive.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_08
 Actually, I think what was it Dave who was suggesting that you just get a computer that has one of these drives and send the computer around to the different sites and just help the computer.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_08
 A laptop.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_08
 A laptop.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_08
 A send the laptop.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_08
 80 gig laptop.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_08
 Of course you don't trust the shippers necessarily so you send a person to and they just don't go to the site.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_02
 I'll do that.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_08
 Download their data.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_08
 Unfortunately it just takes a week at each site.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_02
 What?

0:21:09	SPEAKER_02
 It does take a week at each site.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_02
 Does it?

0:21:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, absolutely.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_02
 If it's a nice site.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, they really need it in a Vesa Bursk.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_02
 That only takes a day or so.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_08
 Anyway.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_08
 But the University of Hawaii has issued a request.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_08
 That needs an opportunity.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_08
 Did that move.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_08
 Things are slower there.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_08
 Definitely true.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_08
 Any other items?

0:21:37	SPEAKER_08
 So, okay.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_08
 So that's the meeting stuff transcripts.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_08
 So you said it was almost half so that means that we have like 80 or so hours and out of that maybe 35 or something.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_03
 The pie chart shows actually meetings that are it combines the categories of you know currently in oh I've got it right there.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_02
 I saw the pie charts.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_02
 There's just a few.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_04
 200 on the board.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_03
 Except for the other.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_03
 I could run on the board.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_03
 It combines categories.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_03
 So when we say transcribed we mean either in the process of being transcribed either here or at IBM.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_03
 Or complete transcription.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_03
 And it also includes checked.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_03
 So it includes a lot of categories to be.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_03
 I see.

0:22:26	None
 So.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_02
 We need different colored pens.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, I think that's that's that if thing is kind of old actually right now.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_04
 Last updated in July.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_04
 That one that you have?

0:22:38	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, I'm not sure.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_04
 The one that I saw on the web when I came back.

0:22:43	None
 Okay.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_03
 The Russell Russell.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_03
 The date on this one is July 26th.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_08
 I have to go here.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_08
 But how much do we have that sort of.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_03
 So we have total number of meetings is 78 meetings.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_03
 And the total meeting time is 75 hours.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_03
 And so the ones that are finished being transcribed as opposed to in the process of being transcribed we've got 26 hours that are finished being transcribed.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_03
 What does that mean?

0:23:18	SPEAKER_03
 Finished being transcribed.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_03
 So there's several processes to the transcription.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_03
 There's ranges from being assigned to a transcriber to them finishing transcription to then being checked with the double check.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_03
 And so when we say the total transcribed that's the one that's gone through being checked I believe.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's what I have here.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_03
 It's not yet approved.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_06
 But not yet approved.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_03
 And then there's the final one is approved for release.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_03
 That's after the meeting participants have.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_02
 So I should probably send those to you.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_02
 If you know.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, currently that's zero released.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_03
 They're five.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_02
 They're five.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_02
 We have five where everyone is replied.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_03
 So we have five that are potentially released.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_04
 So the cross hatching there is.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_04
 It's been through the double check, right?

0:24:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's approval and progress.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_04
 So I mean, when I add a couple more from that we're done in my absence, I think that we're down about there.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_04
 It's not quite as close to half as I thought, but it's, you know, it's more than it.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_04
 And so these right here have been through the double check.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_04
 These haven't.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_04
 How nice of you holding the things on them.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_04
 It was falling off.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_08
 Okay.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_08
 All right. So we still have a lot of ways to go, but maybe the, the IBM thing, well, I'll push through the rest of it some quicker.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_02
 Well, there's still two people for whom I have not been able to get in touch.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_02
 I have never gotten a response from any of the emails about permission forms.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_02
 So are they from one before language ones?

0:25:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yep.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, good.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_04
 That's why the NSA once have still not been approved.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_08
 It was a figure that's prominently in things anyway.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_08
 Yep.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it might, it might partly just be Europeans and communication issues.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_02
 Possibly, it's been like four months.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_08
 Oh.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_08
 How long vacation?

0:25:28	SPEAKER_08
 Okay.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_08
 I'm just going around.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_06
 Can you want to say something about the hardware?

0:25:37	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, that's right.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we have new hardware.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_02
 So I want to set it up at some point.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_02
 So I just wanted to know what meeting schedules were.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_02
 What new hardware?

0:25:45	SPEAKER_02
 We have several more wireless channels so that we can set up and get rid of these, the wired stuff completely.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_02
 And then also we got replacements for these mics.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_02
 So what's your question?

0:25:57	SPEAKER_02
 I don't really like this.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_02
 Those are the only two choices right now, unfortunately.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_02
 So what's your question?

0:26:01	SPEAKER_02
 The question is when are we not recording any meetings for a couple days so that I can do it.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_02
 And if it doesn't work, we won't impact people.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_02
 Well, there's a point.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_08
 So when the bunch of us are off at ERA speech.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_02
 So what smart come?

0:26:15	SPEAKER_06
 Nothing this week, maybe in the end of next week.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_02
 End of next week.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_02
 Is EDU still recording?

0:26:21	SPEAKER_05
 They usually do Thursdays.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_05
 I don't get a lot of advance notice.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_05
 But it's always been either Monday or Thursdays.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_05
 Thursdays?

0:26:29	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, they often do it after.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_02
 So if I did it like tomorrow, that would be all right.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_02
 It sounds like.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, Wednesdays, Fridays.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_02
 So it sounds like no one.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_02
 No one early next week.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, let me check with Robert again, but I'm pretty sure that does nothing this week.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'll also re-number.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_02
 So that the mics are in order.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_02
 Help with the transcripts.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_02
 So right now the channel numbers are discontinuous.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, it's like extra step.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_08
 So I was just thinking maybe just go around and just briefly look.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_08
 Other things that are going on.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_08
 Maybe since we don't have much of a set agenda.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_08
 We don't have much time.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_05
 But feel free to overlap.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, we'll all say what we're doing at the same time.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, I was scared when these portions were not going to overlap.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_05
 That's just state of points.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_08
 So why don't we, we, we, we, we, we, we pick two people to.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_05
 People like that channel.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_08
 Ask much.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_08
 I'll keep seeing you.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_08
 There's absolutely natural meetings.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_08
 We have absolutely no effect from a preconception.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_01
 The transcribers have trouble with your back channel.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_01
 Because with my back channel.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, with your back channel.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_01
 Because sometimes you have the sort of this, this, this aha that you don't know.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_01
 So there's aha and there is aha.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_01
 And it's not quite clear always what.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_01
 Which I mean.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_05
 But I don't think it's aha.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_05
 It's more like aha.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_05
 Resident.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_06
 And.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_06
 I don't like the back channels at all.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_06
 That's really a problem with the speech and non-speech detect.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_06
 Anybody done anything?

0:28:20	SPEAKER_06
 What are we doing?

0:28:21	None
 I mean, I'll start if you want.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_08
 I've been the most recently rewriting transcriber and Java for no particular reason.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I mean, what happened was that transcribers very slow to load.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_02
 So when you have a big meeting, especially on a slower machine, it can take five minutes before you can start doing anything.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_02
 And so I was thinking about why that was and the data structures I would use and I found myself unable not to sit down and code it.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_02
 So I did.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_02
 And so I have a big chunk of transcriber now written in Java and it comes up, you know, in a couple of seconds.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_01
 Do you take feature requests?

0:28:59	None
 Yeah.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_02
 What?

0:29:01	SPEAKER_02
 It's not really, no, probably not worth doing.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think it is worth doing.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_01
 Because here's the thing.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_01
 We're sort of, we're starting to move from transcription to annotation.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_01
 And the transcriber in a face is fine.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_01
 If essentially what you're doing is stringing words together to make transcribers.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_01
 But in, for instance, what we're doing now with communicator data, but what you would like to do with meeting data is to actually label utterances or words or whatever units you want with, you know, basically doing a multiple choice type of labeling.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_01
 And for those type of tasks, it's much more efficient to present a bunch of applicable buttons or whatever.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_05
 But it has to be multi-streamed.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_05
 In other words, the beginning of something could be one speaker and the end of that unit, like question, answer pair, could be a different speaker.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_05
 That's why we can't just annotate the transcripts one listening to one at a time.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_05
 So that's why the transcriber is nice for sort of listening to it, but you can't actually encode.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I understand that.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_01
 And that's actually a good model, which is what this current tool that we're using has is to associate these labels with attributes of HTML tags.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_01
 So, you know, you have say a tag for, I don't know, what type of items, whether it's a question or a statement or whatever, and then you have a tag attribute and the value of that includes the choice.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_02
 So what I don't have with it so far is it doesn't play wave files and it doesn't display wave files, it just haven't done that since that part wasn't display as showing the way for one day.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_02
 And then also a lot of the fancy user interface stuff that's in transcriber I haven't done, but it works.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_08
 What's the original transcriber written in?

0:30:58	SPEAKER_08
 Tickle TK.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_08
 I see.

0:31:00	None
 I know.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_02
 Which is nice and flexible, but very, very slow, right comparison.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_03
 Are you using the, oh, you are, we already talked about that, the XML.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yep, it's actually, yeah, because it's much faster than DOM and uses less memory.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_02
 And then, uh, bearing for calls, uh, hopefully second week of September, if I can never get war in sack to answer my emails.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_02
 I probably shouldn't say that on a safe, yeah, oh well, I gotta remember to beat that out.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_02
 Who was that?

0:31:33	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_02
 So anyway, that's it.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sorry, I forgot about that.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, I wanted to say offline with you about any literature reviews I should do beforehand.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_05
 Weren't peace.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_05
 Weren't peace, that's a good choice.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_05
 Keep me busy.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_05
 It's actually not a bad idea to say beep as a word because you can search the transcripts, you know, for that.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_05
 For beep, that's a good idea.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_08
 Okay.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_08
 I'll take that role anytime you want, I like saying it.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_08
 So.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I've been doing a bunch of recognition experiments on meeting data with different, uh, segmentations with different automatic segmentations, but it's not yet finished.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_06
 It's working progress.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_08
 Okay.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_08
 Any sense about how?

0:32:28	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, for, uh, for the paper, I went to submit to these are you two, uh, you evaluate the quality of the speech and on speech detection by using it for speech recognition.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_08
 Right.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_08
 I was just asking if you had a sense yet of, uh, whether maybe you already did this experiment.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_08
 What was the question of, of how much of hurt you or helped you to use segmented?

0:32:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but we didn't have the exact comparison.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_01
 You know, there were, the experiments were based on different segmentations and different transcripts.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_01
 So we weren't quite sure what, what of the difference came from different transcripts, for instance.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_06
 And so it hurts compared to the ideal segmentation when you have the manual segmentations where you have exact boundaries for each other.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_06
 And so sometimes there are some, some words are cut off for.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_06
 There's some segments are assigned to speech, which there is nothing in.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_06
 And so there are more insertions, but most of the time there are more, the, the number of deletions is higher when, when you use the automatic segmentation compared to the ideal one.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_06
 And so I'm just in, in progress of yet trying to feed the recognize of both unsigmented data and see how much worse that is.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_06
 So that, that I have three things.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_01
 Unsegmented the automatic and the ideal one.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I just got back.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_07
 I was going to post some results.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_07
 Was content with fishing was, was content fishing.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_08
 So your results are about same as both.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_08
 You should have seen the one that got away.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, who's results?

0:34:21	SPEAKER_08
 Bushes.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, you're both sort of, he's going back to the heartland.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, right, exactly.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_07
 I did my short part of heartland.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, built a few classes.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_07
 But right now I guess I'm working on this paper, this isca paper for this workshop that listen and dress.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_07
 So we're just getting different results for, we fixed up our different transcripts with different types of annotations.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_07
 And we ran, we ran alignments and we're going to develop a new feature database based on those alignments.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_07
 And do some trees and analysis.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_07
 So I'm kind of in the middle of that.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_07
 And flee by the 20th, 23rd.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_05
 20th?

0:35:04	SPEAKER_07
 20th.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, we'll have it all straightened out.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_07
 It's going to be a busy week.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_01
 I bet Bush went on the CRP intrep recently.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_01
 They told him that they got more vacation so he came back here and thought I'd have to somewhere with this.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_11
 Me.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_08
 I think he's been, he will have been off like two months out of his first seven.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_08
 It's hard to keep.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_08
 Very good deal.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_08
 Concentration.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_01
 I really know this.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_01
 So while he's vacationing, we've been, well, basically this is like a joint effort.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_01
 We're time for it.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_01
 Bush, you're done.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_01
 You know, apart from getting, preparing the data for the, for these experiments, for the, for this project, for this project workshop, we just, we just had a phone call with Mari and her students in fact.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_01
 And they want to, they're bringing up their own meeting recognize, which is based on Bill Burns, recognize from Johns Hopkins.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_01
 Based on Hub 5, like, based on their Hub 5 recognize, and so they've been getting from us the, you know, some support in terms of getting the latest transcripts and the, also the actually transcripts annotated with events like sentence boundaries and stuff like that.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_01
 Because one of Mari's students was, wants to do some language modeling for predicting overlaps and stuff like that.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_05
 Actually, we had this idea from the last time that they were here that it'd be nice to have UW do some work on language modeling that would be trying to get at the same detection as what we do acoustically since they can ramp up much quicker on the language modeling and we don't, you know, we want to do the prosotic side.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_05
 And so this is supposed to be a project that we could actually integrate the pastures that they get from their language model for every word boundary, every frame boundary, and then train up the classifiers.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_05
 And it's, I guess it's an undergrad too that, that's going to be doing this work.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_01
 On the recognition side, actually, I think the main person doing that is Herit from Herit Nark from, yeah, formerly Cambridge.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_01
 And apparently they get reasonable results except in some portions they get very high in search and rates, even higher than we get with the lag evenly on the halmikes with background speech and so they were trying to track that down.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_01
 It could be that our recognizes actually doing relatively well because it has a reject model for mismatched speech essentially or for unspecified speech.

0:37:53	SPEAKER_01
 So I sent them our recognition outputs so they can sort of do a line by line comparison and see if they, you know, their insertions correspond to our rejects and stuff like that.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll see what that leads to.

0:38:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, other than that, well, that's much, pretty much it.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_01
 As far as meeting certain sort of.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, I mean, we're doing, as I said mentioned, Dave and I have sort of been pushing through thinking in terms of an ASRU paper, but still, I think early next week with the side weather, we'll do one or not.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_08
 But because the results are still confusing enough that we've got to be convinced we understand what's going on.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_08
 But it's starting to look like it's almost the opposite of the usual situation where you get some really nice result with digits A and then you go to a large corpus and the result goes away.

0:38:55	SPEAKER_08
 We had what looked like a good result in digits but then we went to more training data that kind of went away.

0:39:01	SPEAKER_08
 So the digits result right now is kind of equivocal.

0:39:06	SPEAKER_08
 But the conversational speech one, well not huge, is in sort of hub five or meeting kind of terms.

0:39:12	SPEAKER_08
 Actually, it's not bad, you know.

0:39:15	SPEAKER_08
 So it's, you know, it's like after he did some adjustments more like a percent or so that it absolutely goes down.

0:39:22	SPEAKER_08
 It's a PhD.

0:39:25	SPEAKER_01
 Sometimes. But it's still true that basically the speaker adaptation sort of negates much of the data.

0:39:33	SPEAKER_08
 No, I'm talking about with the adaptation. Without the adaptation is a much bigger effect.

0:39:38	SPEAKER_08
 Okay.

0:39:39	SPEAKER_08
 So it's very reasonable to think it was an alternative way of getting this kind of kind of improvement.

0:39:44	SPEAKER_08
 But I think what ultimately we have to face with it is that I mean he gets incredibly good results if you artificially reverberate close to my data. So I think the thing we really have to face is that our model for what's going on is wrong or incomplete.

0:40:02	SPEAKER_08
 And that in this situation, particularly there's a lot of noise.

0:40:06	SPEAKER_08
 And noise plus reverberation is not all the same as just reverberation.

0:40:09	SPEAKER_08
 So there's one thing that I've been thinking of doing is there's a whole lot of work that's been going on in noise suppression in the Aurora team.

0:40:19	SPEAKER_08
 And so they've got some software and I'm thinking of just having us integrate that in.

0:40:24	SPEAKER_08
 Is it mine at sea?

0:40:25	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, because it just I mean it just subtracts it out.

0:40:28	SPEAKER_08
 In fact, in fact, you can run it and sort of enhance it when we get speech out and just run it through the rest of your recognizers.

0:40:35	SPEAKER_08
 So.

0:40:36	SPEAKER_08
 So.

0:40:38	SPEAKER_08
 Let's work on that.

0:40:45	SPEAKER_01
 There's some work that do you remember this paper or poster by some CMU folks at the HLT.

0:40:58	SPEAKER_01
 They were talking about and they referred to an upcoming I cast paper I think at the time.

0:41:03	SPEAKER_01
 Someone in culture I think worked on estimating noise from the sudden regions and then doing some explicit.

0:41:16	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if it's something akin to parallel model combination or something like that to.

0:41:21	SPEAKER_01
 I mean people have done that for a long time.

0:41:23	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:41:24	SPEAKER_01
 So I couldn't judge whether this was original or not but it seemed like they got pretty good results on their meeting data.

0:41:33	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, I don't remember the paper but I mean that that's certainly one of the common techniques is to do that.

0:41:38	SPEAKER_08
 And in all these the stuff that our team is doing they certainly look at regions that you think are non-speech or to get nice statistics.

0:41:46	SPEAKER_08
 And they use a host of things different things you can do.

0:41:55	SPEAKER_08
 And the Aurora thing we have a little bit of a handicap in that they don't watch you adjust the statistical models.

0:42:01	SPEAKER_08
 So you have to do everything at the future level.

0:42:04	SPEAKER_08
 But there's a weener filtering and spectral subtraction which are sort of can be looked at as minor modifications of one another.

0:42:13	SPEAKER_08
 And they've now built up a nice piece of software that does has a sort of general framework for it so you can adjust it to sort of any any one of a dozen ways that people have done this kind of thing.

0:42:26	SPEAKER_08
 And they found a particular set of parameters they like this week and we're running with that for a while.

0:42:36	SPEAKER_05
 So I'll just really briefly so when working with Don and also in Andreas on the this paper on positive and what we're trying to do is predict where people at given all information up to whatever point in time you're considering trying to predict if that's a good location for someone else to jump in.

0:42:56	SPEAKER_05
 So that's the idea of that paper and that's the same task that Marie a student named Dustin and also Sarah who was at this last meeting will be looking into doing from the language model.

0:43:07	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe some kind of clustered class and grammar or something.

0:43:12	SPEAKER_05
 And also we're using a couple of the lablers who are doing a motion to help us finalize some transcripts for this.

0:43:19	SPEAKER_05
 So these undergrad undergrad students are really helping us out a lot under Don's provision actually that's good. So these offices are being very busy Don's and the one across from them.

0:43:28	SPEAKER_05
 And then also working with Jeremy on communicator emotion labeling and most of that up to a few weeks ago was just getting the people labeling these utterances to a computer for emotion and that's going pretty well now.

0:43:42	SPEAKER_05
 What kind of emotions do you label well we're mostly looking for places where the person's frustrated with the system.

0:43:49	SPEAKER_08
 So it's just two categories frustrated not there.

0:43:52	SPEAKER_05
 There are actually that's how we started.

0:43:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:43:55	SPEAKER_05
 And we had different levels now we have things like amused like oh you finally got it.

0:43:59	SPEAKER_05
 And this appointed tired like yeah no that's wrong again which isn't really mad but you know so they gave me a lot of feedback the lablers after doing this told me what they wanted as categories.

0:44:10	SPEAKER_05
 And then there's jokes.

0:44:12	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:44:13	SPEAKER_05
 Right. There's not a lot of enough frustration for us to really go through quickly because we have to label every meeting and also things like repeats for the same information and so forth.

0:44:22	SPEAKER_05
 And I've been coordinating a little bit with Katrin at UW who was doing user correction work that she presented at the at the meeting.

0:44:31	SPEAKER_05
 So there's some overlap there and what you know there's a correlation between corrections and annoyance or frustration.

0:44:40	SPEAKER_05
 But Jeremy's been starting to really work on that project now from the acoustic side so we have all these waveforms and he's been with Morgan's help and Dan Ellis is I think looking into spectral tilt of it.

0:44:50	SPEAKER_05
 So he can talk about that.

0:44:52	SPEAKER_05
 It's a feature we haven't used before.

0:44:54	SPEAKER_05
 And starting to take information from alignments and create a database that we can use sort of as a large feature vector table to feed to our decision trees which we'll try to give us back and answer from the speech only as to whether the person's frustrated.

0:45:14	SPEAKER_08
 That reminds me of something we talked about something ways back and I sort of lost track of it about having a synthesizer driven with.

0:45:24	SPEAKER_05
 I haven't really actually had time to do that to talk with you about that because there's a similar project at SRI where we're used that we want to do something like that to look at whether or not some of the stylized pitch stuff is sort of perceptually similar to the kinds of things that people would mark.

0:45:41	SPEAKER_06
 So I actually wanted to talk to you maybe after Wednesday.

0:45:45	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, because you have this ASS or your deadline.

0:45:48	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, just will be after sometime.

0:45:50	SPEAKER_08
 But that seemed like it would be fairly straightforward that you take the pitch from the real data.

0:45:54	SPEAKER_08
 Right.

0:45:55	SPEAKER_08
 If you did into the synthesizer and then process the output with a gain box that you also had energy from the real data.

0:46:00	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, there was just no way to use the energy that still exists in the English.

0:46:04	SPEAKER_01
 We have to do the English synthesis for smart come.

0:46:07	SPEAKER_01
 What if we make the system really annoyed?

0:46:10	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, anyway, I should move on because we're running late.

0:46:13	SPEAKER_05
 But I wanted to say there's one question in my mind which maybe Morgan can talk to Jeremy about is how to sort of normalize spectral tilt is just sort of in this area I don't know much about.

0:46:24	SPEAKER_05
 And so we should talk offline.

0:46:26	SPEAKER_05
 But if you have a certain speaker and you want to sort of get a bunch of data from that speaker but compare it directly on a feature to like a decision tree that won't normalize anything for you once you feed it the features.

0:46:38	SPEAKER_05
 How do you sort of normalize over a particular speaker what makes sense to do with that feature?

0:46:44	SPEAKER_08
 Well, after you're with us using given the different suggestions he's got.

0:46:47	SPEAKER_05
 That's something we would be glad to have help on.

0:46:52	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:46:54	SPEAKER_05
 So go ahead, Jeremy.

0:46:56	SPEAKER_00
 All right, so I've been looking at spectral tilt and different ways of perhaps generating it and basically have three ways right now that we're looking at for we're going to look at for features.

0:47:08	SPEAKER_00
 One is just looking at first kept stroke coefficient and using that.

0:47:15	SPEAKER_00
 Another is looking at the difference of log energies between the high frequency band and a low frequency band and a third is just taking a slope of the linear fit of the spectrum and using that.

0:47:33	SPEAKER_00
 So those are the three ways I have right now for generating these spectral tilt numbers and hopefully soon can look at some of the labeled stuff and look at these numbers and see which ones seem to be working well and things like that.

0:47:51	SPEAKER_00
 Also recently wrote a script that generates the Kappa statistic, which is a for labular agreement.

0:48:02	SPEAKER_00
 So looking at that as well.

0:48:11	SPEAKER_05
 Specifically what you want to do is remove the average speaker tilt in some sense.

0:48:35	SPEAKER_05
 You don't know it.

0:48:44	SPEAKER_05
 You want to capture the change in voice quality within a speaker without having to know ahead of time, which is which because it's circular.

0:49:11	SPEAKER_05
 And we can try all of them and just put them in.

0:49:14	SPEAKER_08
 Well the answer is yeah, I mean you want to figure out where the place is going to go.

0:49:17	SPEAKER_01
 You can't just normalize it based on the utterance because then you're going to have zero everywhere.

0:49:22	SPEAKER_01
 So you'd have to normalize it based on everything for the speaker.

0:49:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay, but that's not really feasible because you have a system, a dialog system where you only have access to what the speaker said before.

0:49:34	SPEAKER_01
 So it have to be sort of a causal.

0:49:36	SPEAKER_05
 Oh yeah, that's okay. That's the sort of we keep you keep iterating, you keep updating those numbers for future.

0:49:43	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, I mean, but the main thing is that you're right.

0:49:47	SPEAKER_08
 I mean the main distinction is whether it's voice or voice turnout.

0:49:50	SPEAKER_08
 If it's if it's silence or on voice regions, then you don't really want that in there if you can help it.

0:49:56	SPEAKER_08
 But actually, I mean just the first order, suppose you just didn't do anything smart at all and just did, you know, did that.

0:50:02	SPEAKER_08
 It wouldn't be that bad because you get some number that would be skewed by you skip that.

0:50:07	SPEAKER_05
 Using the V and the variant.

0:50:09	SPEAKER_08
 You know, X, X minus mu or sigma.

0:50:13	SPEAKER_08
 Right, right.

0:50:14	SPEAKER_05
 So it is distributed in a way that you can do this.

0:50:18	SPEAKER_08
 It's sort of the first order thing to do.

0:50:20	SPEAKER_08
 There's obviously much more arcane things to do and complicated things to do.

0:50:24	SPEAKER_08
 That was our sort of, but that's the first thing to do.

0:50:27	SPEAKER_08
 And then, you know, then the next thing is, well, let's just look at the voice regions, you know, and that would be a reasonable thing to do.

0:50:34	SPEAKER_08
 And then if it's really, when you look at which, since you're looking at something that's sort of in log domain, cap stroke is like log, you know, linearly transformed the log domain, it's probably not that terrible assumption of attendance Gaussian anyway.

0:50:45	SPEAKER_08
 And so the other things that get more, more tricky are to handle the fact that it's not really Gaussian.

0:50:51	SPEAKER_08
 And I mean, I really need that for this.

0:50:54	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, so I think that would be the obvious thing, too.

0:50:58	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we're not going to build a parametric model of that.

0:51:02	SPEAKER_01
 Of the future, right?

0:51:04	SPEAKER_01
 We just kind of could use that.

0:51:05	SPEAKER_01
 No, I understand.

0:51:06	SPEAKER_08
 It's just, no, it's more that if you felt something wasn't Gaussian, and you were trying to normalize for some kind of bias of some sort, you might use a nonparametric measure, you might use a median, you know, and rank statistics and all that sort of stuff.

0:51:21	SPEAKER_08
 But I mean, it shouldn't bother with any of the traffic outings.

0:51:24	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:51:25	SPEAKER_11
 Okay.

0:51:26	SPEAKER_05
 Thanks.

0:51:28	SPEAKER_05
 Sure.

0:51:29	SPEAKER_08
 And I already said what I was doing, which is mostly trying to give advice to Dave when he actually does the real work on this reberpiration thing.

0:51:41	SPEAKER_08
 But I think it's a real learning experience for both of us.

0:51:46	SPEAKER_08
 And I think it's a problem, an error problem area that people really haven't dealt with that much, as we know.

0:51:52	SPEAKER_08
 So he kind of did, he started off with what was in some sense sort of the first obvious thing to do, although hardly anybody had done it yet.

0:52:01	SPEAKER_08
 And it does work very well under some conditions, and other conditions it doesn't, and now we're understanding, trying to understand what those are.

0:52:08	SPEAKER_08
 It's fun.

0:52:11	SPEAKER_08
 She just got back.

0:52:16	None
 No fish.

0:52:18	SPEAKER_08
 Okay.
