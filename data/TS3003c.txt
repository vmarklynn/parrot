0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 Just received a little beep.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what it was.

0:00:14	None
 Okay.

0:00:19	SPEAKER_03
 Now good afternoon.

0:00:23	SPEAKER_03
 This is our third meeting already.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_03
 I hope you enjoyed your lunch.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_03
 I did anyway.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_03
 Let's see.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_03
 Presentation three.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. This is the second phase we're going to discuss today.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_03
 It's the conceptual design meeting and a few points of interest in this meeting.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_03
 Are the conceptual specification of components, conceptual specification of design, and also trend watching.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_03
 These are hopefully the points you addressed in your presentations.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_03
 You're going to show me in a few minutes.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_03
 But first, I'll show you the agenda.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_03
 First the opening.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_03
 Then we have three presentations. After that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_03
 Are we going to make it? And then we're closing. We have about 40 minutes.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_03
 So I suggest let's get started.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_03
 Did someone encounter any problems during the preparation?

0:01:49	SPEAKER_03
 No. Everything fine. It's nice.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_03
 Then a little thing about the last meeting.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_03
 These are the points we agreed on. The requirements and the target market.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_03
 Our requirements are data text, docking station, audio signal, small screen with some extra button information.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_03
 And we're going to use default materials.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_03
 Does somebody have any comments on these requirements?

0:02:27	SPEAKER_03
 No. These are just the things we thought of.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else, just let me know.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you can work it out.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_03
 And we're going to target the 60 to 80 year old customers.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_03
 So now everybody knows what we're doing.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_03
 I suggest let's get started with the presentations.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_03
 So should we keep the same line up last time?

0:03:00	SPEAKER_03
 Sure. Okay. I'll start off now. Good luck.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to inform you about the trend watching I've done over the past few days.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_01
 We've done some market research. We distributed some more on cats, questionnaires.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_01
 And besides that, I deployed some trend watchers to Milan and Paris to, well, get a hold of the news trends.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_01
 And I've consulted some additional trend watchers after the original trend watchers return about what the best design would be.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. These are some overall findings.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_01
 The most important thing is the fancy design. The research indicated that that was by far the most important factor.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_01
 Inovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design. By inovativeness, this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_01
 And half as important as the inovativeness was easy to use.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_01
 For our group, we're focusing on the people of 60 to 80 years old.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_01
 These factors are slightly more equal.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. These are some more group specific findings. The older people prefer dark colors.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_01
 They like recognizable shapes and familiar material and our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_01
 This image will give you a little bit of an impression about the look and feel that the remote should have.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_01
 This leads us to some personal preferences. The remote control and the docking station should blend in the room.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_01
 This would mean no eye-catching designs. Just keep it simple.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_01
 The docking station and the small screen would be your main points of interest because this would be the inovativeness in the remote control.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_01
 This would be very important that we at least include these features.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_01
 The trend watchers I consulted advised that remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_01
 You could imagine that remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_01
 This is pretty much a new shape to older people. They would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_01
 It would be more telephone-shaped. Besides that, we would advise to bring two additions.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_01
 One with a wood-like color and maybe feel. One with a gray-black color.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_01
 The wood-like for the more exclusive people, people with more money. The gray-black color for well.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_01
 People with less means. That would be all.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. Thank you.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_03
 Any questions?

0:07:16	SPEAKER_03
 I'll go to the next one.

0:07:24	None
 Okay.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_00
 This is some research about designing of interface.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_00
 Last meeting we had about using a few buttons.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_00
 That's what I want to do in our design.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_00
 I found a way to control the remote control.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_00
 I found something about speech recognition. Maybe we can use that.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. And using a little display.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_00
 I found some of the findings.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_00
 Just to focus on the primary functions.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_00
 So only buttons for sound.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_00
 For one of shifting up again in the channel or that shifting down.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_00
 We need some new interactive functions which attract people for using it.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_00
 Like speech recognition.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_00
 And a special button for selecting a sub-title.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_00
 And overall user-friendly.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_00
 It's possible to make a quite cheap system for speech recognition.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_00
 You can think about when you lost your remote control.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_00
 You can call it and give it a sync.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_00
 And for shifting up a channel or for putting out a sound or something.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_00
 You can just give a sound off.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_00
 And the elevation of the sound off.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_00
 I was thinking about a special button for subtitles.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_00
 Just one button to keep it simple.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_00
 One push on the button.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_00
 You get small subtitles.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_00
 Double push.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_00
 Double click.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_00
 You get big subtitles for people.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_00
 Which can read smaller subtitles.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_00
 We have to keep in general buttons.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_00
 The buttons we have to use, the sound higher and lower.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_00
 The general button, more one button for shifting down a channel.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_00
 Also we want to use a little display for displaying the functions of the buttons.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_00
 We can build in a function which shows the channel.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_00
 A little picture of it.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_00
 We can put on off button in this corner.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_00
 All remote controls are using on off button on the place.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_00
 People will recognize the button.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_00
 This display of it is just a small display.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_00
 We can put it on top.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 It is the most place where people most often look at.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_00
 A special button for shifting up and shifting down a channel.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_00
 On the top of the button, you can easily shift up or shift down.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_00
 Quite any place.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_00
 All the functions for subtitle.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_00
 We have to discuss about the form of it.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_03
 That's it.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_02
 The components design for the energy source, we can use a basic battery or as an optional thing, a kinetic energy like in a watch which you just shake and it produces energy.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_02
 If we choose for that option, the docking station would become obsolete.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think it's really an option.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_02
 For the casing, the manufacturing department can deliver flat casing, single or double curved casing.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_02
 It's really up to the design that we're going to use.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't imply any technical restrictions.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_02
 As a case supplement, I thought of that later.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_02
 A rubber belt like anti-slip.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_02
 For the buttons, we can use plastic or rubber.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_02
 The chipset, it's as simple here, but it should be advanced because we're using an LCD screen.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_02
 As the trend watch presentation showed, people like wood, but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image unless we would start to product lines.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_02
 The form should follow function overall.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_02
 The kinetic energy source is rather fancy, but it depends on what we want.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should discuss that.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_02
 For the case, the supplement and the buttons really depends on the designer and the chipset really should be advanced because otherwise it would really be a simple remote control.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_02
 That's it.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_03
 That brings us to the discussion about our concepts.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_03
 These are the points we have to discuss.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_03
 First, I think we can talk about the energy source since it has a pretty big influence on production price and image.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_03
 First of all, we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_02
 There are four options.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 We could use the basic normal battery, a hand dynamo, but I don't think that's really an option.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_02
 We don't want to swing before you can watch television.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_02
 Solar shells, but not every room is very light, so it's not a very good option, or the kinetic

0:16:38	None
 energy. How exactly does the kinetic energy work?

0:16:44	SPEAKER_01
 You basically shake your remote and then it powers up.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_01
 Personally, I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_01
 Besides that, you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_01
 I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we could get great popularity for our product.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_00
 What's the function for allowing the batteries?

0:17:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you could load up batteries.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_01
 You could insert, find a lost remote control function in there.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_00
 I won't use much energy, I believe, just a small display, so I believe it will run on one battery for six months or more.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_00
 I believe one battery is just enough.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I think elderly people just like to have everything in place, and I don't think they like remote, just laying everywhere in their rooms.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_03
 Also, what you said, you can introduce a voice recognition by finding back-ear remote, but I think it's more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_03
 You can put a little bit of a button on your docking station, which you can push, and then it starts beeping.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_03
 We can still use the voice recognition, but maybe then for only the channels.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_01
 I'm wondering, what will the voice recognition mean for the production price?

0:18:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's a good point.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_02
 I don't have any informational pricing, so I'll have to ask the manufacturing department.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_01
 In our earlier market research, if you would allow me to push in the front board.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_01
 Go ahead.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_01
 So it was open here.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_01
 We also asked if people would pay more for speed recognition in a remote control.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_01
 You can see here our target group would not do that.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_01
 If they would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control, I would greatly advise not to do it.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_01
 I think it would be better to insert in our other product that is meant for the younger

0:19:43	SPEAKER_02
 people. That would also go for the LCD screen then, I guess.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_02
 It's a bit higher percentage.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_01
 Well, this is, yeah, but this is, here the question was, would you prefer it?

0:19:59	SPEAKER_01
 So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_01
 And on top of that, the LCD screen would help in making the remote control easier to use.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, and I think the voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier

0:20:17	SPEAKER_03
 to use. No, I think that's a good point.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_00
 But as Richard about a large LCD display or just a small one, we want to use.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_01
 Well, this was for like an LCD screen like you would have on the most advanced mobile phones.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_01
 So pretty large.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:41	None
 Yeah.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_03
 I personally think the LCD screen we want to use with the extra information, I think nobody has anything against it because it's just some extra information and it's easy to ignore as well.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_03
 So if you don't want to use it, you just don't use it.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_03
 And yeah, I think maybe we have to discard the voice recognition because it will increase cost significantly.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_03
 And I don't think it will be a lot easier to use as well.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_03
 So that brings us back to the energy.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_03
 If we don't have voice recognition, it won't use a lot of energy to use.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_03
 So in that case, we could use kinetic energy.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_03
 But I think just a simple battery, which you can reload on a docking station, is just as good and much cheaper as well.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_03
 And that's the best choice.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_03
 Let me just choose for the battery.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_03
 That brings us to the chip.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_02
 Well, there isn't any choice there because we're using the display.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_02
 So it's got to be advanced.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_03
 That's fun.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_03
 Chip.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_03
 And then we get to the point of the case, which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_03
 If you want to choose for wood or the black and gray or both.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_03
 As we saw, there is not, yeah, wood is a lot more expensive to produce.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_03
 But I think it will attract elderly people who want to have something exclusive, which they can show up to their grandkids.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_03
 Got a new remote control.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_01
 I know.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_01
 I think the most important factor there is the wooden collar.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_01
 So it wouldn't actually have to be wood.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, if it's just, that's right.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_01
 Wood-colored.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_03
 Wood-colored was a lot more expensive.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_03
 Or?

0:23:09	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_02
 You don't know.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_02
 I'll have to.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_02
 I think so.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_02
 Because, yeah.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_03
 Probably.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_03
 It's a lot more difficult to handle and to get in the right shape.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_00
 It's possible to make changeable.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_00
 You've got mobile phones.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_00
 Like Nokia mobile phones.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_00
 When you can change the case of it.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_00
 So it's the case.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it's possible.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_00
 Possibility.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_00
 So you have just to make one standard remote control.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_00
 And you can sell a few.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_03
 You can sell the case.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's a very good option.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_03
 Because then you can advertise as well with the give your grandfather a new case for his remote control or whatever.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_03
 Because it's something extra.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_03
 It's something other remotes don't have.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_03
 Which we can get a greater advantage point.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_03
 So and then you can make a smooth collar, black and gray.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_03
 Other colors as well.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_01
 So you can put carefully into the design though.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_01
 Because we would have to make one control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover or original one.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_01
 Or standard one.

0:24:41	None
 Yeah.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_03
 So you suggest we should design two different telephones.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_03
 Or we can supply.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_03
 But remote control.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_03
 Which you can apply different case covers.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_03
 Well no.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_01
 For example.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_01
 We should just we should then just design one remote.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_01
 But it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_01
 So.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_01
 But that shouldn't be too much of a problem.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_03
 So everybody's okay with the changing covers.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_03
 That's a good option.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_03
 Changing case covers.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_01
 I heard our industrial designer talk about flat single and double curved.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_01
 Could you explain that a little more?

0:25:33	SPEAKER_02
 Well the general like most older remotes are flat just straight.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_02
 And are the manufacturing department can also do they have a single curved or double curved cases.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_02
 And would single curves and double curved mean?

0:25:52	SPEAKER_02
 It would just only affect the form for far as I know.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_02
 So it's really just up to the design department what we're going to use.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_01
 So we can pretty much just pick one you like.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_01
 That's good.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_03
 But the form has to be it has to be possible to stand up or just only to let.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_01
 Just lay down.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_03
 And the cover of the docking station is also on top of the television then or not.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_01
 Well or besides it.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_03
 And you can just yeah click it in.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_03
 That's okay.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_03
 So the interface what type of interface do we want to use.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the board.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_03
 Somebody have ideas for a form or?

0:26:55	SPEAKER_00
 We can just use the regular form of it but it's not quite fancy.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_01
 You said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the right side so your thumb would be easily.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_01
 Well I think that was a very good point because I pointed out earlier that a lot of remote caused air as I said it would be great for that.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_01
 I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both left and the right side.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_01
 For left handed users.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_01
 Also.

0:27:34	None
 Yeah.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_00
 Is it possible to program it so you've got on the left side or on the right side buttons for shifting open shifting up.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_00
 Now on the other side buttons for shifting for the sound.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_01
 Well that could.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the ease of use.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult than that.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_01
 If we would make changing channels and changing volume button on both sides so it certainly yield great options for the design of the remote.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_01
 Because it could be made all symmetrical and stuff.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah but you have extra buttons so people can get confused.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_01
 That is true.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_03
 Especially if they have the same writing so not.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_00
 Especially or you have to make left.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_00
 Contemaker.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_03
 Contemaker remote which you can flip over and use on the same functions as the normal one.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_00
 You mean.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_03
 Blank one.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_03
 Then you get.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_03
 There is a little LCD screen.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_03
 Now I have to think.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_03
 It's a plus and a min.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_03
 No it's not very handy I think.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_03
 Because the plus and a min will be opposite and all kinds of.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_03
 No that's not going to work.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_03
 I guess.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you should.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_03
 But is it the problem that left handed persons use a different hand?

0:30:31	SPEAKER_03
 I think the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with choosing a channel.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_00
 It's just you think you're a thumb.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_03
 I think we could just leave it in normal shape.

0:30:50	None
 Yeah.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_03
 But maybe we have to make it a bit more fancy in one another way.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should start by choosing a case because that's the basis you're building on.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:09	None
 Yeah.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_02
 So I could draw them out.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_02
 Let's get this flat case.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_02
 Oh.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_02
 From the side so.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_02
 Just right on normal.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_02
 The single girth so I'm not really sure what they're going to look like but I think it's something like this so this type should be better for you or better should prevent.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_02
 Better the straight injury a bit and the double girth looks something like this I guess.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_02
 So those are the three options we have.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_03
 I should just the single girth because maybe the girth is pretty good to put the screen in so that elderly people can use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen because it's a bit.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_03
 That's a bit of an angle.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_00
 You say it's.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_00
 You got like a belief.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_00
 So you want to put this play over here or not?

0:32:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_03
 But now it's can make the upside down or do you have a.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_00
 Let's talk.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_00
 It's down.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it's possible to make this site like.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_00
 See.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_00
 Like so in the form of your hand.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_00
 So.

0:33:43	None
 Yeah.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_00
 So the remote control I have to.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_00
 Lay in your hand so it's possible.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_00
 So get your mouse.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_00
 And the.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_00
 And the buttons for.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_00
 Changing the channel over here.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_03
 That's a good one.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_03
 But I think it's better to put the screen on top.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_03
 So just flip it 180 degrees around.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_00
 And you get.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_00
 This place.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_03
 That's about here.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_03
 If you can have this one you turn it like this and then flip it upside down.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_03
 Because maybe your hand is in the way if you have to display here.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_02
 It's more logical to have it on top as well because I think it's like on your mobile phone.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_02
 It's always a ball.

0:34:43	None
 So.

0:34:44	None
 Yeah.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe you should just start on a blank page.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_03
 So then we get.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_03
 This is the curve.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_00
 Life minutes.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_03
 And then we can.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_03
 And then the rest of the buttons over here.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_00
 But I'm the enough button still on the top.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_01
 And I'd prefer the corners to be round.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_03
 Supplements.

0:35:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_03
 That's my mouse.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_03
 Then we've got the general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_03
 So now for the next meeting we'll have to look at the look at field design.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_03
 It's important that the corporate design image is going to be in the remote.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_03
 So check out the corporate website maybe.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_03
 The user interface design is the same story and product evaluation.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_03
 So the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_03
 But you're going to get your instructions I think, send it by the coach.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_03
 So just I will put these minutes in the folder.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_03
 And then we're going to try to finish our project and make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_03
 I think we should...

0:37:13	SPEAKER_03
 Let's see.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_03
 And then you'll get a message.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_03
 So that's basically it.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe this one.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_03
 And you can save this one in the folders group.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_03
 It's here.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_03
 Smartboard.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_03
 There it is.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_03
 So if you want to have a look at it, it's over there in the project folder.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_03
 And then I guess we will start in 30 minutes again.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_03
 Good.

0:38:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_03
 Right on time.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_01
