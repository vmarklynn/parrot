0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 Just received a little beep.

0:00:09	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what it was.

0:00:14	None
 Okay.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_03
 Not good afternoon.

0:00:22	SPEAKER_03
 This is our third meeting already.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_03
 I hope you enjoyed your lunch.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_03
 I did.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_03
 Anyway.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_03
 Presentation 3.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. This is the second phase.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_03
 We're going to discuss today.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_03
 That's the conceptual design meeting.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_03
 And a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components, conceptual specification of design, and also trend-watching.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_03
 These are hopefully the points you addressed in your presentations.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_03
 You're going to show me in a few minutes.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_03
 But first, I'll show you the agenda.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_03
 First, the opening.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_03
 Then we have three presentations.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_03
 After that, we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_03
 How are we going to make it?

0:01:34	SPEAKER_03
 And then we're closing.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_03
 We have about 40 minutes.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_03
 So I suggest let's get started.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_03
 Did someone encounter any problems during the preparation?

0:01:49	SPEAKER_03
 No. Everything fine?

0:01:52	SPEAKER_03
 That's nice.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_03
 Then a little thing about the last meeting.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_03
 These are the points we agreed on.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_03
 The requirements and the target market.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_03
 The requirements are data text, docking station, audio signal, small screen, with some extra button information.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_03
 We're going to use default materials.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_03
 Does somebody have any comments on these requirements?

0:02:27	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_03
 These are just the things we thought of.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else, just let me know.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you can work it out.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_03
 And we're going to target the 62 to 80-year-old customers.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_03
 So now I've already noticed what we're doing.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_03
 And I suggest let's get started with presentations.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_03
 So we keep the same lineup as last time.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_03
 Sure.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_01
 I'll start off then.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to inform you about the trend watching I've done over the past few days.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_01
 We've done some market research.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_01
 We distributed some more UNCAT questionnaires.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_01
 And besides that, I deployed some trend watchers to Milan and Paris.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_01
 To, well, get all of the news trends.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_01
 And I've consulted some additional trend watchers after the original trend watchers return to the market.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_01
 About what the best design would be.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_01
 These are some overall findings.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_01
 The most important thing is the fancy design.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_01
 The research indicated that that was by far the most important factor.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_01
 Inovitiveness was about half as important as the fancy design.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_01
 This means functions which are not featured in other remote controls.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_01
 About half as important as the inovitiveness was easy to use.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_01
 For our group, we're focusing on the people of 60 to 80 years old.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_01
 This is, these factors are slightly more equal.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. These are some more group specific findings.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_01
 The older people prefer dark colors.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_01
 They like recognizable shapes.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_01
 And familiar material and our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_01
 This is, this image will give you a little bit of an impression about the look and feel that the remote you have.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_01
 This leads us to some personal preferences.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_01
 The remote control and the docking station should blend in the room.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_01
 So this would mean no eye catching designs.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_01
 Just keep it simple.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_01
 The docking station and the small screen would be our main points of interest because this would be the inovitiveness in the remote control.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_01
 So this would be very important that we at least include these features.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the trend watchers, I consulted, advised that it should be the remote control and the docking station should be telephone shaped.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_01
 So you could imagine that the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_01
 This is not really, this is pretty much a new shape to older people.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_01
 So they would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_01
 So it would be kind of more telephone shaped.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_01
 Besides that, we would advise to bring two additions.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_01
 One with a wood like collar and maybe feel.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_01
 And one with a gray black collar.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_01
 The wood like for the more exclusive people.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_01
 People with more money.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_01
 The gray black collar for, well, people with less means.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_01
 That would be all.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, thank you.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_03
 Any questions about the trends?

0:07:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, we're going to the next one.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, yeah, this is some of my research about designing of intvates.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_00
 Last meeting we had about using a few bit.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_00
 That's what I want to do in our design.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_00
 Finding a directive way to control the remote control.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_00
 I found something about speech recognition.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can use that.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_00
 And using a little display.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_00
 Findings.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_00
 You have just a focus on the primary functions.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_00
 You can only button the sound for on off shifting up a channel or down shifting ground.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_00
 We need some new interactive functions which attract people for using it.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_00
 Like speech recognition and special button for selecting sub titles.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_00
 Just what we mentioned last meeting.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_00
 And overall, use a friendly, so using large bitters.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_00
 It's possible to make a quite cheap system for speech recognition.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_00
 You can think about when you lost your remote control.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_00
 You can call it a signal.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_00
 And for shifting up a channel or for putting out the sound or something, you can just give a sound off.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_00
 And the television of the sound off.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_00
 I was thinking about a special button for sub titles.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_00
 Just one button.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_00
 To keep it simple.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_00
 One push on the button.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_00
 Double push.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_00
 Double click.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_00
 You get big sub titles for people.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_00
 You can read small sub titles.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_00
 We have to keep in general buttons.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_00
 The buttons we have to use.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_00
 The sound is higher and lower.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_00
 The numbers are 0 to 9.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_00
 And the general button, one button for shifting down a channel.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_00
 Also, we want to use a little display for displaying the functions of the buttons.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_00
 We can build in a function which shows the channel or which the television is on.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_00
 We can put an off button in this corner.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_00
 Almost all remote controls are using an off button on that place.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_00
 So people will recognize the buttons.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_00
 Display, or just a small display, you can put it on top.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 It's the most blazer people most often look at.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_00
 And special button for shifting down a channel.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_00
 On the top of the button, you can easily shift up or shift down.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_00
 You can use a little display for the buttons.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_00
 And overall design, we have to discuss about the form of it.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_02
 The docking station would become obsolete, so I don't think it's really an option.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_02
 For the casing, the manufacturing department can deliver a flat casing.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_02
 Single or double curved casing.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_02
 It's really up to the design that we're going to use.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't imply any technical restrictions.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_02
 I thought of that later, a rubber belt like an anti-slip.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_02
 For the buttons, we can use plastic or rubber.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_02
 And the chip set.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_02
 It's as simple here, but it should be advanced because we're using an LCD screen.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_02
 And as the trend watch presentation showed, people like wood, but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_02
 Unless we would start two product lines.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_02
 The form should follow function overall.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_02
 Well, the kinetic energy source is rather fancy, but depends on what we want.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should discuss that.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_02
 For the case, the supplement and the buttons really depends on the designer.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_02
 And the chip set really should be advanced because otherwise, it would really be a simple remote control.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_03
 That's it.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_03
 So that brings us to the discussion about our concepts.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_03
 So these are the points we have to discuss.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_03
 First, I think we can talk about the energy source since that's has a pretty big influence on production price and image.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_03
 So I think first of all, we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, there are four options. We could use the basic normal battery, a hand dynamo, but I don't think that's really an option.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_02
 You don't want to swing before you can watch television.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_02
 Solar cells, but not every room is very light, so it's not a very good option or the kinetic energy.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_01
 And how exactly does the kinetic energy work?

0:16:44	SPEAKER_01
 You basically shake your remote and then it powers up.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_01
 Well, personally, I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's true.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_01
 And besides that, you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_01
 And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we could get great popularity for a product.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_00
 What's the function?

0:17:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, for allowing up the batteries.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you could load up the batteries.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_01
 You could insert the, find the lost remote control function in there.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but I won't use much energy.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_00
 I believe just a small display, so I believe it will run on one battery for six months or more.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_00
 I believe one battery is just enough.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I think elderly people just like to have everything in place.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_03
 And I don't think they like remote just playing everywhere in their rooms.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_03
 And also what you said, you can introduce a voice recognition by finding back your remote.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_03
 But I think it's more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_03
 So you have a button on your docking station which you can push and then it starts beeping.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_03
 And then we can still use the voice recognition, but maybe then for only the channels.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_01
 I'm wondering, what will the voice recognition mean for the production price?

0:18:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's a good point.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_02
 I don't have any informational pricing, so I'll have to ask the manufacturing department.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_01
 Because in our earlier market research, if you'd allow me to push your flat board, go ahead.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_01
 So it was open here.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_01
 We also asked if people would pay more for speed recognition in a remote control.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_01
 Like you can see here, our target group would not do that.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_01
 So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control, I would greatly advise not to do it.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_01
 I think that would be better to insert in our other product that is meant for the younger people.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_02
 But that would also go for the LCD screen then, I guess.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_02
 It's a bit higher percentage, but.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 Well, this is, yeah, but this is here. The question was, would you prefer it?

0:19:59	SPEAKER_01
 So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_01
 And on top of that, the LCD screen would help in making the remote control easier to use.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, and I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_03
 No, I think that's a good point.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_00
 But it's a rich here about a large LCD display or just a small one we want to use.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_01
 Well, this was for like an LCD screen like you would have on the most advanced mobile phones.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so pretty large.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_03
 I personally think the LCD screen we want to use with the extra information, I think nobody has anything against it.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_03
 Because it's just some extra information and it's easy to ignore as well.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_03
 So if you don't want to use it, you just don't use it.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_03
 And, yeah, I think maybe we have to discard the voice recognition because it will increase cost significantly.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_03
 And I don't think it will be a lot easier to use as well.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_03
 So that brings us back to the energy if we don't have voice recognition.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_03
 It will, it won't use a lot of energy to use.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_03
 So in that case we could use kinetic energy, but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good and much cheaper as well.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_03
 And that's the best choice.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, let me just choose for the battery.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_03
 That brings us to the chip.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_02
 Well, there isn't any choice there because we're using the display so it's got to be advanced.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, that's what's the funst chip.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_03
 And then we get to the point of the case which brings us a little bit back to the marketing as well.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_03
 If you want to choose for wood or the black and grey or both.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_03
 As we saw there is not, wood is a lot more expensive to produce.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_03
 But I think it will attract elderly people when they have something exclusive which they can show off to their grandkids.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_03
 They have a new remote control.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_01
 I think the most important factor there is the wooden collar. So it wouldn't actually have to be wood.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's just wood colored.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_03
 But wood collar was a lot more expensive?

0:23:09	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_02
 I'll have to.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_03
 I think so because it's a lot more difficult to handle and to get in the right shape.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_00
 Is it possible to make a changeable case?

0:23:27	SPEAKER_00
 You've got mobile phones.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_00
 Like Nokia mobile phones.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_00
 When you can change the case of it.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_00
 It's the case.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, maybe it's possible.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_00
 Possibility.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_00
 You have just to make one standard remote control.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_03
 You can sell the case.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's a very good option.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_03
 Because then you can advertise as well with the...

0:24:02	SPEAKER_03
 Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control or whatever.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_03
 Because it's something extra.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_03
 And then you can make a new one.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_03
 And then you can make a new one.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_03
 And then you can make a new one.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_03
 And then you can make a new one.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_01
 And then you can make a new one.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_01
 We would have to look carefully into the design though.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 Because we would have to make one control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_01
 Or a original one.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_03
 Or a standard one.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_03
 So you should just be designed two different telephones.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_03
 Or which you can supply remote control.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_03
 Or which you can apply different case covers.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_01
 Well, no, I think so.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_01
 We should then just design one remote.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_01
 But it would have to be fancy with either a wood cover or a plastic one.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_01
 But that shouldn't be too much of a problem.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_03
 So everybody is okay with the changing covers?

0:25:18	SPEAKER_03
 That's a good option.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_03
 Changing case covers.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_01
 I heard our industrial designer talk about a flat single and double curved.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yes. Could you explain it a little more?

0:25:33	SPEAKER_02
 Well, the general, like most older remotes are flat, just straight.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_02
 And are the manufacturing department can also do they have a single curved or double curved case?

0:25:47	SPEAKER_01
 And would single curves and double curved mean?

0:25:52	SPEAKER_02
 It would just only affect the form for as far as I know.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_02
 So it's really just up to the design department what we're going to use.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_01
 So we can pretty much just pick one you like.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. That's good.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_03
 But the form has to be, it has to be possible to stand up.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_03
 Or just only to lay down.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_03
 The cover of the docking station is also on top of the television then.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_01
 Well, or besides it.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_03
 And you can just click it in. That's okay.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_03
 So the interface, what type of interface do we want to use?

0:26:44	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the board.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_00
 Somebody have ideas for a forum where we can just use the regular forum of it.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_00
 It's not quite a fancy show.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_01
 You said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the right side so your thumb would be easily...

0:27:13	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think that was a very good point because I pointed out earlier that a lot of remote calls are as I.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_01
 So it would be great for that.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_01
 I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_01
 For left-handed users.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's possible to program it.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_00
 So you got on the left side or on the right side buttons for shifting or pins shifting up.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_00
 On the other side buttons for shifting for the sound.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that could do that.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if that would be very good for the ease of use.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_03
 Use a few.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_03
 It would be a lot more difficult than that.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_01
 But it would make changing channels and changing volume buttons on both sides.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_01
 So it would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_01
 Because it could be made all symmetrical and stuff.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but you have extra buttons so people can get confused.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that is true.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_03
 Especially if they have the same writings on it.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_00
 Or you have to make a left...

0:28:47	SPEAKER_03
 You can make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same functions as the normal one.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_00
 You mean...

0:29:02	SPEAKER_03
 Let's see.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_03
 Blank one.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_03
 Then you get...

0:29:33	SPEAKER_03
 Here's a little LCD screen.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_03
 Now I have to think.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_03
 It's a plus and a minus.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's not very handy, I think.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_03
 Because the plus and a minus will be opposite.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_03
 No, that's not going to work.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_03
 I guess.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it's...

0:30:25	SPEAKER_03
 Is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand?

0:30:31	SPEAKER_03
 I think the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with choosing a channel.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_00
 It's just using your thumb.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_03
 I think we could just leave it a normal shape.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_03
 But maybe we have to make it a bit more fancy in another way.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should start by choosing a case because that's the basis you're building on.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_02
 So I could draw them out.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_02
 Let's get this flat case.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_02
 From the side, so this is rather normal.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_02
 The single curved, so I'm not really sure what they're going to look like, but I think it's something like this.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_02
 So this type should be better for you or better.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_02
 Should prevent.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_02
 Rebet it to straight injury a bit.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_02
 And the double curved looks something like this, I guess.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_02
 So those are the three options we have.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_03
 I should just... the single curved.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_03
 Because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the screen in.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_03
 So that elderly people can use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen because it's a bit of an angle.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_00
 What you say is...

0:32:47	SPEAKER_00
 You got a curved...

0:32:50	SPEAKER_00
 I believe.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_00
 So you want to put this play over here?

0:32:58	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, thanks.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_03
 But now it's...

0:33:08	SPEAKER_03
 Do you have an upside down or...

0:33:11	SPEAKER_00
 That's top.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it's possible to make this side like...

0:33:22	SPEAKER_00
 Color...

0:33:31	SPEAKER_00
 To make this side like...

0:33:38	SPEAKER_00
 A bit like...

0:33:40	SPEAKER_00
 So in the form of your hand.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_00
 So the remote control...

0:33:49	SPEAKER_00
 I have to play in your hand.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_00
 So get your mouse.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_00
 And the buttons for...

0:34:02	SPEAKER_00
 Changing the channel over here.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's a good one.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_03
 But I think it's better to put the screen on top.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_03
 So just flip it 180 degrees and run.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_00
 And you get...

0:34:20	SPEAKER_00
 This play...

0:34:21	SPEAKER_03
 That's about here.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_03
 If you can have this one you turn it like this and then flip it upside down.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_03
 Because maybe your hand is in the way if you have to display here.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_02
 It's more logical to have it on top as well because...

0:34:39	SPEAKER_02
 Like on your mobile phone.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_02
 It's always a ball.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:34:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you should just start on a blank page.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_03
 So then we get...

0:34:59	SPEAKER_03
 Here's...

0:35:07	SPEAKER_03
 This is the curve.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_00
 Five minutes.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_03
 Here the display and then buttons.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_03
 And then we can...

0:35:27	SPEAKER_03
 I'm a little bit off here and here maybe.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_03
 Just that's for left hand and right hand users.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_03
 And then the rest of the buttons over here.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_00
 On the off button, still on the top.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, still here.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_01
 And I'd prefer the corners to be round.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:51	SPEAKER_03
 A bit more friendly.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_01
 And the on the on the on.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_03
 Supplements.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_03
 That's okay.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_03
 That's very nice.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_03
 Then...

0:36:09	SPEAKER_03
 We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_03
 So now for the next meeting, we'll have to look at a field design.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_03
 It's important that the corporate design image is going to be in the remote.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_03
 So check out the corporate website maybe.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_03
 The user interface design.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_03
 It's the same story.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_03
 And product evaluation.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_03
 So the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_03
 But you're going to get your instructions, I think, send it by the coach.

0:36:49	SPEAKER_03
 So just...

0:36:52	SPEAKER_03
 I will put these minutes in the folder.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_03
 And then we're going to try to finish our project and make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_03
 Which one?

0:37:13	SPEAKER_03
 Let's see.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or...

0:37:19	SPEAKER_03
 I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_03
 And then you'll get a message.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_03
 So that's basically it.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe this one.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you can save this one in the...

0:37:36	SPEAKER_03
 The folder's group.

0:37:42	SPEAKER_03
 It's here.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_03
 Smart boy.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_03
 There it is.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_03
 So if you want to have a look at it, it's over there in the project folder.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_03
 And then I guess we'll start in 30 minutes again.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_03
