0:00:00	SPEAKER_00
 Oh yes, I forgot my test.

0:00:07	None
 Okay.

0:00:08	SPEAKER_00
 Is that all right now?

0:00:15	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:00:16	None
 Let's go.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_03
 Someone turn these on.

0:00:19	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry?

0:00:20	SPEAKER_03
 Someone turn these on.

0:00:22	None
 Great.

0:00:23	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:00:24	SPEAKER_00
 I'll set to start the meeting.

0:00:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_00
 We've got half an hour for this one.

0:00:29	SPEAKER_00
 I'll discuss the functional design.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_00
 Thanks.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_00
 All ready to go? Okay.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_00
 So hopefully, if I've been working away, and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_00
 So I guess just to recap on what we did last time.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_00
 I got to nature a little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss a bit about the project, and you've caused how much money we had to spend.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_00
 Just want to tell you that we have three new requirements, which is the first one, is that the companies decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_00
 Nobody uses teletext very much anymore.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_00
 So we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the remote control.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_00
 They've also suggested that we only use the remote control to control the television, not the VCR or DVD or anything else.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_00
 I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex, it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into production, the time to market.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_00
 So we're just going to keep it simple and it'll just control the TV.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_00
 The first thing was that the company wants the corporate color and slogan to be implemented in the new design.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not entirely sure what the corporate color is.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_00
 It might be yellow because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_03
 And the slogan, like the actual written slogan, or just to embody the idea of the slogan?

0:02:43	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that's the thing. I'm not sure.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_00
 Because on the company website, what does it say?

0:02:52	SPEAKER_00
 What's the thing in the fashion and electronics?

0:02:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. I mean, is that something they want to actually written on?

0:02:59	SPEAKER_00
 Because it's quite long.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_00
 Or, yeah, just the idea that I'm not sure.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_00
 So that's something we can discuss as well.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_00
 So those are the three things.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_00
 Just not to worry about teletext, only control the TV and incorporate the color and slogan of the company.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_00
 So, is everybody okay with any of that?

0:03:21	SPEAKER_00
 I don't really need to recap at all.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_00
 But time for presentations, and who would like to go first?

0:03:30	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not going first.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, cool.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_02
 All right, can I steal this from the back of your laptop?

0:03:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, of course.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_02
 Just like opaque, you can shoot ï¿½ If I were to look online I had a look at the home page which has given us some inspiration from previous products.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_02
 I had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and I would like to ask you guys for your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting and unfortunately when I looked at all the talk I was thinking.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, having a look at the existing products I found that it tends to come into two extremes.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_02
 There's either a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons, lots of colours, very confusing.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_02
 You don't know what you're doing.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_02
 In that case the label is going to be very bad.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_02
 There's an example I should eat the end.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_02
 I'll show you now.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_02
 I'll see you see here.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_02
 There's a button there and there.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_02
 This one's perg.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry, that one's perg and that one's perg and it doesn't really tell you what it does.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure if you had a look at the other controller now in that example.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_02
 It's a very simple one.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_02
 It's got only the basic functions but the same size as the hard to use one.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_02
 It's a very big and not very much used for actual buttons.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_02
 It's a very hard to access the advanced functions.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_02
 There's nothing for instance for a slow motion button.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_02
 My own preference is I prefer the clunky one.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_02
 It's very easy to use but unfortunately it does like the advanced functions which I quite like having on the controls.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_02
 I believe the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in the drawer.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think I have any problem with it.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_02
 I've got to put your preferences unless you're a problem we'll go.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_00
 I would come to chat for five minutes or so I think.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_00
 I'd most discover that anyway.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_03
 A lot of what I've read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what Craig has just gone over.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_03
 I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also add some of this which is just about market research.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_00
 We'll stick to kind of your area.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's supposed to be the same size but it's got much fewer buttons.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's a valid point.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_00
 The one on the left looks quite complicated and that PROG thing is incredibly confusing.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_00
 I see why you might prefer the simpler design but you don't want to lose out on what it does so maybe you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of open up the thing and that's a good idea.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a good idea.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_02
 Do we have any functions we'd want on it?

0:07:43	SPEAKER_02
 So far I've got iron off so it's the channel up and down and the volume up and down.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_02
 They're just the very basic use by TV.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_00
 And then actual numbers for channels as well.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_02
 You see that's how the quad one or a question one which was that?

0:07:59	SPEAKER_02
 The numbers are the up down.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_00
 I would say that's required.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_00
 There's no way anybody's going to buy a remote control these days so she can't actually individually select channels.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_00
 I mean would anybody disagree with that?

0:08:13	SPEAKER_00
 What else?

0:08:15	SPEAKER_00
 So don't need to worry about teletext, don't need to worry about VCR.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_00
 Any kind of display controls at all do you think we need to worry about?

0:08:26	SPEAKER_03
 Is it brightness and contrast?

0:08:29	SPEAKER_03
 We're doing right now as we're categorizing we're saying we want this to be a product that offers all the more tricky features but we want them to be in another area.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_03
 Is that right?

0:08:39	SPEAKER_03
 Is that what we're kind of sorting with them?

0:08:43	SPEAKER_03
 Or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want product to have?

0:08:46	SPEAKER_00
 I think are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would

0:08:49	SPEAKER_02
 be nice? To start with, we need to find out exactly what we have to have.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_02
 Not that we can add things if they're possible.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, right.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_00
 Well, do you want to maybe just at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a function of this.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_00
 So so far just to recap we've got volume and channel control.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_02
 And volume and channel and skip to certain channels with the numbers.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_00
 Right, okay.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_03
 Well, one way I would look at this would be that we approach the different controls in terms of like control types so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do, where they go.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_03
 And I also think maybe a little bit about what we just want to be easily accessible.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_03
 For example, if we had audio controls those could be something people set up very rarely.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe they're in a little area, but covered up.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_03
 Things like channel and volume are used all the time.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_03
 So we just have them right out on top.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_03
 Very just very self explanatory.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_03
 You know, like one which are just the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip and others that are also available and then others that are concealed.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, and we're just to wrap up quickly on this little section.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_00
 Do you think maybe that's the only kind of essential requirements and there may be just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio setup and display setup and things like that.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe like a mute button.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_00
 That's really saying any of the ins and outs of that at all.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, if we can move on to next presentation then please.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_03
 Can this reach, can this plug come across?

0:10:56	SPEAKER_00
 Probably not actually.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_03
 So why don't I just pick up and.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_06
UK.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_03
 Can you go behind me?

0:11:23	SPEAKER_03
 I'm all in the audience.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_03
 It's very complicated.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_00
 I'm all in the audience.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_00
 It's very complicated.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_00
 It's very nice if everything was wireless in it.

0:11:30	None
 Okay.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_03
 So I can say already, I don't know whether this is for good or for bad, but there will be a lot of kind of redundancy in the issues and the...

0:11:47	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, like overlap between what you said.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, probably not necessarily bad thing, but what I've already started doing is I created a slide in my presentation here so that we kind of think, well, what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and mine, because certainly I have a hard time separating things completely.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_03
 It's hard to know what your land is in.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_03
 Obviously what you just told me impacts a lot on what, like market research that I've been...

0:12:18	SPEAKER_03
 So how do I get this up?

0:12:20	SPEAKER_00
 I put yeah, I put function in F8, yeah.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_06
 All right.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_06
 So...

0:12:28	None
 Actually...

0:12:29	SPEAKER_05
 I'm sharing the blue button.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_01
 Thanks for the control on the left.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, and F8.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_06
 Appreciate it together.

0:12:38	None
 Mm-hmm.

0:12:39	None
 Okay.

0:12:40	None
 I think that's it.

0:12:41	None
 Yeah.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_02
 Again, we need the one, the button might be this.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, here we go.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:13:01	None
 Okay.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_03
 Just before I bring this up, what I'll just say is what I've done is try to collect some information so that I can then relay this to you guys so that it now becomes a collective thing and then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding, okay, what are our options?

0:13:16	SPEAKER_03
 What should we decide?

0:13:17	SPEAKER_03
 And do you know what I mean?

0:13:21	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_04
 Can you...

0:13:26	None
 Right.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:28	None
 All right.

0:13:29	None
 Okay.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_03
 So, um, that makes sense.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_03
 So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of tried to think about how we could review it and how we could and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities because certainly there's lots of different information to go through.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_03
 So, um, I'm thinking here about primarily about customer needs that we start with the customer and what they want and what are issues with existing products.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_03
 I just think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion and electronics.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_03
 And then as I say, we'd like to prioritize our design features from this and...

0:14:20	None
 Okay.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_03
 So, this is what I've found here.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_03
 A lot of this is new to me.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_03
 So, we'll just read two together.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_03
 Users dislike the look and feel of current remote control.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_03
 So, if I find them ugly, most people find them ugly.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_03
 The vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_03
 We'll see later, the vast majority of people would spend more money for slightly more intuitive controls such as voice recognition.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to...

0:14:54	SPEAKER_03
 We'll look at that in a second.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_03
 Most people use only a very slim portion of all the controls.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_03
 So, I guess what we're looking at here is people want this technology.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_03
 They tend to use the most simple controls and overall, they find remote controls to be something they don't...

0:15:11	SPEAKER_03
 Doesn't really appeal to them.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like...

0:15:14	SPEAKER_03
 For me, this is sort of like three different, different, um, inspirations.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_03
 One is that we want something that's high tech but we want it to seem easy.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_03
 And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high tech side, we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_03
 Frustrations, they get lost a lot as it came up in our last meeting.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_03
 Takes time to learn how to use them.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_03
 This is why I mentioned when Craig was showing us some ideas that we actually try and group control.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_03
 So, it doesn't just look like a big panel.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_03
 Kind of like when you look at, you know, a new computer keyboard or something that is quite explanatory if you want audio, if you want visual, and you have those.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_03
 And I will admit, I don't know what RSI stands for.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_00
 Headed it's train injury.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_01
 Is installing a remote control for many people?

0:16:07	SPEAKER_03
 No, that did not come up at all.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_03
 So here's another sort of a review here of the main things.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_03
 I also found most people would, adults at least, would pay more for voice recognition.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_03
 Apparently, we do have access to all the cutting edge technology and remote control.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_03
 So I don't know if that's possible.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_03
 We might consider getting into it.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_03
 And again, here as we sort of move, sort of things, start thinking about how we want to sell and market this, I think a recurring theme here is the company wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_03
 People additionally aren't liking the appearance of their product.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_03
 So we want to think about, as we take all the sort of the techie features, how we can put that into a unit which is, which people like, you know, they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_00
 So once in the end, it looks good and it's easy to use.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_00
 Big priorities.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so just looking at what Craig's ideas there, sort of tell me that maybe what we want to do is try and separate the different things that we want to include in this.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_03
 If we do say, well, we want there to be all the technology, but we try and make that almost be like optional technology.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's like, I find a lot of TVs these days, something really nice about them is, if you want to just turn them on and off, you can.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_03
 But they have little panels where you click.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_03
 And there's just like tons of features.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_00
 So you want to grip all the different kind of types of functions together.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_00
 You know, that's the thing that I do.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_03
 That's sort of, but I hope here is that I'm putting out this information so we can then say, okay, well, how do we collectively move on with it?

0:17:57	SPEAKER_03
 I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea, although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles and then use that, but not let that confine us technologically.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_03
 Any comments on all of that?

0:18:19	SPEAKER_00
 Well, one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're going to be, who's our target audience or target market.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_00
 So if we want something that looks good and it's easy to use, but has, is fairly powerful product or whatever, who do we really want to aim that at?

0:18:39	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, where's the money?

0:18:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, who would have the money to spend?

0:18:45	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if like 25 euro is our selling price, and you can imagine, well, I'm not really sure how much that will retail at, but you want, it's somebody who's not going to just use the remote that comes with their tally.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_00
 I suppose they're going to actually go out and buy one.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_00
 So who do you think we're aiming this at?

0:19:03	SPEAKER_01
 I think it'll be the mid range to high end market in terms of people because 25 euros for a remote, how much is that?

0:19:12	SPEAKER_01
 It's about 16, 17 pounds, I think.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_01
 Is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote?

0:19:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe not the high end range, but maybe middle, middle, up-ish.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_01
 So how much, I don't know, I guess you would be like 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, like a simple replacement.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, if you lost your remote and the first thing you just want to go out and get-

0:19:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. This kind of touches on your comments here, David.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_03
 These are the age groups which we have information on, and these are, this is a table of what people would pay more for a certain feature.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_03
 Just give us a rough idea of where the will to spend money on TV equipment is.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_03
 Mostly focused around the 25 age group.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_00
 So do you think we're aiming at a fairly young market then?

0:19:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_03
 Sort of young professional.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_00
 Do you think then voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider?

0:20:08	SPEAKER_00
 What do you think, Craig?

0:20:11	SPEAKER_02
 Well, you don't see it was the adults that were going through the voice recognition.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, yeah.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_05
 That's the- Yeah.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_03
 It does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying in terms of-

0:20:24	SPEAKER_00
 I think we are going to have to narrow it down to say, let's target these people and give them what they want.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_00
 Because you know, there needs to be some kind of selling point to it.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_00
 So anybody, anything to add, just kind of young professionals, like if we are going to include speech recognition, it's kind of between 15 and 35.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_00
 It seems to be like a really high response to that.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_00
 So we could say that was our target.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so 5 to 35 is fair to add that in and that's more than half a group of people who are willing to at least try to use it.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_00
 So 15 to 35, look fairly young.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_00
 You know, they have a bit of expandable income to spend on this sort of thing.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_01
 I think perhaps that age group is significant as well, because those are people who use the computer who are familiar with the computers in the everyday world.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_01
 I think people who are ABBOP, I wouldn't say 35, but people are on a 48-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or about phone or something like that.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_01
 So the people who are gadgety, right?

0:21:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_01
 Growing up used to, you know, in schools and universities, when they go on to their working lives, they go forward.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_00
 So they're not shy away from something quite high-tech.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_00
 That's a good point.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_00
 So shall we make the decision to include speech recognition?

0:21:47	SPEAKER_00
 If we can.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_01
 I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say, you have to use speech recognition right now.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_01
 Why is that?

0:21:56	SPEAKER_01
 Based on what you, everybody's saying that you want something simple.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_01
 You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_01
 You speech recognition might not be the simplest thing.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_03
 Could it be an on-off thing?

0:22:08	SPEAKER_03
 Like if you want it.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_01
 We can act a bit and de-actress.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_01
 We're trying to lock ourselves into a particular kind of technology.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_01
 So we're focusing on exactly what are the features that we're going to say.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_01
 Say speech recognition is good for this.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_01
 Speech recognition is not good for this.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_01
 I suggest that we think about speech recognition.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_01
 It's something that can be used to fulfill a function.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_01
 Uh-huh.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_01
 And then, you know, today we don't look at the technology but we'll get the function first.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_00
 Well, do you want to give us your presentation and then we can, I might have been a good idea to all deliver presentations and then discuss.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_00
 But this is a hybrid.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_00
 Good to get ideas out while there's a question in mind.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_00
 It's something that's just occurred to me as well as if we make it, um, speech recognition, if we incorporate speech recognition, that's appealing to people, um, maybe with, uh, physical disability as well.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_03
 And not losing.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_03
 And also it helps in terms of people not losing this, you know, they, they're saying, oh, it's, I lose it in the couch.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_03
 It's like we're kind of, we're, we're sort of getting into here is mating different, uh, design features together.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_02
 One problem is speech recognition is, um, I've actually seen one of them used and, uh, the technology was, and that one wasn't, but I'm using it.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_02
 So you end up yelling control for hours, for example, up.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, really, you've seen one before.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_00
 Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it?

0:23:33	SPEAKER_00
 I think it'd probably be quite expensive to, to, to.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_04
 Of course not.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_04
 I think so.

0:23:39	None
 Nice.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_01
 Well, this is just the working design.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, this is just what, how I would go about it.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_01
 Um, I guess I tried to define like what we're doing now.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_01
 Try to define what we're trying to get done.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_01
 Um, I think in a practical way, we kind of know what it is.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_01
 We've used it with familiar with it, but we're, we can't, we have a narrow down, um, exactly what the things we're trying to fulfill.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_01
 But, um, I think in the back of our minds, we know what the basics are.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_01
 It's changed how it all does, it came falling, but in like specifics, which one of the basics are you trying to target?

0:24:15	SPEAKER_01
 Um, are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics?

0:24:20	SPEAKER_01
 Um, and I just, the idea is just to get everybody to, um, I usually have a, have a design as a, as a basic.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 So, you know, things that, to start everything going, but I guess everybody does have some ideas.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think, um, anything to that.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_01
 Um, okay, this finding things is a little bit confusing, so I'll go into the diagram.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_01
 It just explains how the process goes through from the, from the basic technology point of view, the basic steps that you need, um, in the diagram.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_01
 This slide probably works better.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_01
 Um, okay, you need some power source, get a battery or something to keep it going.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_01
 Um, and that power source is important because it ties you down to, um, how long the device will last?

0:25:05	SPEAKER_01
 Uh-huh.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of technologies.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_01
 Um, how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_01
 Like for example, voice recognition, right?

0:25:16	SPEAKER_01
 That might be constrained because that you might need to power microphone, you might need to power other thing.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_01
 So that's one, perhaps, constraint, yeah.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_01
 Um, okay, the basic thing is, as a user in a program, you can, you know, you can, you can shut it apart.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_01
 Inipped that path using a device.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_01
 If one button has an opinion, when the object iservesin, um, looks blank to it because it applies slide, so the network actually is done.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_01
 If it is used forWhoosheduct, you've got, two questions, aAndViewÃ , andickers.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_01
 a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device and the device has to you know, based on push button A, so I will do something with button A, so maybe button is a problem. And then it needs to be able to send it to the device itself, which is a secret here. And I think that's what it's about. It's fairly general. And I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in the way you're thinking, like voice recognition, that if it's something which is important, then we just add more power, rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power, so it's not going to be a constraint in that sense.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, these are functionally, you know, what they're going to do.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. So I guess the rest of it, I think we should, maybe you want to go back to what the questions are. I think you're more relevant to discussion.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_00
 Do you want to finish up your presentation? Are you all done?

0:26:40	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, it's just putting the rest of it into words, but it's essentially a thing.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_01
 You have a translator and you can just write it to the computer.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. And like, on the, I mean, since we're on the topic of the technology, are there any, like, what are our options? What's, what is in, is this the only way that we go about it?

0:27:03	SPEAKER_03
 Are there other?

0:27:04	SPEAKER_01
 These, these aren't technology options in that sense.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_01
 This is just the basic principle of principles and basic components that I needed.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_01
 For example, if you needed to add a voice recognition, right, then you use it in the base, we'll just put broken down more components, right?

0:27:23	SPEAKER_01
 You have a microphone, but we are something that.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_00
 So it's just how we're kind of modularizing the whole thing.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_01
 So each component represents one function, but I think the basic functions are the logic, the transmitter, and the receiver, okay, and the power are things that you won't have to care about.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_01
 And those are things that based on what your user interface requires and will add more functionality to it.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_01
 There might be one other consideration which would be the transmission between the remote control and the TV, for example.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_01
 Are we going to restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies as an indicator?

0:27:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_01
 Because that's something unique to actually be physically pointing to.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_00
 Well, a worry that was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex, it would affect how long it took us to get this to market.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_00
 So I suspect it might be a good idea to restrict our kind of creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about how we transmit it.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_00
 Because it's tried and tested and for ads.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_01
 So there might be a little problem with the transmission in particular analysis we're talking about voice recognition.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_01
 If somebody's going to talk to the device, you really want them to hold it to them.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_01
 You may not require that, but it's something very natural, I guess, to hold it to signal to the user and push a button to start talking about it.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_01
 Then you need to send the signal out, so if you're using infrared, the line of sight, I'll say the TV is at that chair and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter here blocks it.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_01
 So in that sense, there's not really a restriction, but it's something you may have to think about later on in the process.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_03
 And just a clarification before we finish this, is our controller, have the option of being on a standard frequency as all of the other equipment?

0:29:17	SPEAKER_03
 So that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment?

0:29:21	SPEAKER_01
 There's not much specific information, but I think that one indication of infrared means that they're just targeting traditional devices.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_01
 Because infrared is something that you've been having.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we've in the new requirements spec, they said just to focus on a TV, so that's what we should do for now, I think.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_00
 Something I was wondering about was the power.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_00
 Is it worth considering having a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries?

0:29:44	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, is that something you really want to go into, do you think?

0:29:47	SPEAKER_00
 Or should we just consider running on regular batteries?

0:29:50	SPEAKER_01
 From a component point of view, there's added complexity, and you add cost to it.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_01
 And then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component, you need a docking cradle, for example.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_01
 Put it into charge.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_01
 Or you need to get the user to plug it in.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_01
 So most users are used already, use the value of buying batteries and putting it into the controller.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_01
 Unless the controller is going to consume a lot of batteries, like, it's going to run through batteries a month, then I don't think we charge about something that you're not doing.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so just stick to regular.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_00
 So, basically, I'm just going to just recap.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_00
 When I said at the start, it was that the whole point of this meeting was to absolutely finalise who were going to aim this at and what exactly the product is going to do.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_00
 So, just to recap on, are we all happy about the idea of aiming the product at the 15 to 35 bracket?

0:30:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_00
 And also the actual functions of what it's going to do, do you want to recap on that, Craig?

0:31:03	SPEAKER_02
 I think we used to say that it was going to be the most basic stuff possible.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_02
 On, off, up and down, down, up and down, volume, and skip to the channel.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_03
 Is it going to include any of the more advanced features or are we going to eliminate those?

0:31:21	SPEAKER_02
 I think we include new, but apart from that, I think we just go for the simplest.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_03
 Is it, is it, is it, is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under, like, sort of under a door?

0:31:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's as optional functions.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_03
 What I might be a bit worried about is if someone was had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then, and then they.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_03
 You know, they get ours.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_03
 It's, it doesn't have that.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if that'd be a problem.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_01
 And I think that you're saying about categorizing the people.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe I could suggest we break them down in this reasonable kind of use.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_01
 One would be audio control.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_01
 One would be video control.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, one would be a device.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_01
 This may not map very well to advanced functionality especially, but I think that from a manufacturer point of view, I think from a point of view of a person using it, you know, a TV is something to see and something to hear.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_01
 And it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_01
 What we could have is like two buckets.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_01
 We could throw things into like if you want this feature, that's where you can hear.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_01
 And then from there, it's basically what's non-basic.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_01
 And it would actually help with the component.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_00
 Great.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I've got a kind of got five minutes to wrap up now.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_00
 Next thing we're doing is having lunch.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_00
 And then we're going to have 30 minutes of working on the next stage.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_00
 So I'll be pulling the minutes of this, this meeting into the project documents folder.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_00
 So I guess just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next, well, in the 30 minutes after lunch anyway.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_00
 For our industrial designer, you're going to be thinking about the components concept.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_00
 User interface designer, you're going to be thinking about our user interface and marketing.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_00
 You're going to be thinking about trend watching.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_00
 And you'll all get specific instructions as well.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_00
 So I know just to ask now, if you've got anything else you thought about while we've been talking.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_00
 And do you want to start with David, then else to say at all.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_03
 I just wanted to ask them before we wrap up, should we agree for sake of sort of clarity and when we resume that we'll use this idea, David's proposal, we think of these three sort of buckets and.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think that's definitely a good idea.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_03
 We're talking about this.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_02
 Should we do that?

0:34:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_02
 So I know the three buckets, what would go in the device function is fine.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_01
 Things like on off.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_01
 Because they don't have anything to do with what you see.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_01
 In terms of picture and the entertainment value.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_01
 So.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_01
 And channel.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_01
 And channel.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_01
 Because the on off also goes, you know, like on off like power, not on off sound.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_01
 You have a choice of putting it on to others for device.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_01
 Device is basically anything which we can't categorize.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_00
 So you're going to have audio, which is going to be like, you know, you base settings and actual volume.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_00
 Anything to do with what you hear.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_00
 And then visual.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_00
 Anything that you can see.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_00
 So brightness contrast, things like that.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_00
 And then just actual device things like what channel you're watching, turning it on and off.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_00
 Stuff like that.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_03
 And I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the device category, there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others, which are maybe a bit more.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_03
 Like random, which we have no other place to push.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_01
 Somewhere there.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_01
 So I think very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_01
 It's easy to use.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's one thing that.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_01
 And I guess from the corner point.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_00
 So yeah, I guess just things to think about are, you know, like the fact it's got to look good because of who were, you know, targeting this up.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_00
 Something maybe kind of quirky in design, maybe make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold, you know, things like that.

0:35:51	SPEAKER_00
 So I guess, I guess that's it.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_00
 Right.
