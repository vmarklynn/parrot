0:00:00	SPEAKER_00
 Oh yes, I forgot about that.

0:00:07	None
 Okay.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_00
 So, all right now.

0:00:15	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:00:16	None
 That's cool.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_00
 Someone turned these on.

0:00:18	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry?

0:00:19	SPEAKER_03
 Did someone turn these on?

0:00:20	SPEAKER_03
 Great.

0:00:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, everybody, I'll start the meeting.

0:00:24	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, we've got half an hour for this one.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_00
 To discuss the functional design.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_00
 Thanks.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_00
 Already to go.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_00
 So, hopefully, it was working away.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_00
 And I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder.

0:00:45	SPEAKER_00
 So, I guess just to recap on what we did last time.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_00
 I got to know each other a little bit and got familiar with all the equipment.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_00
 And started to discuss a bit about the project.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_00
 You've caused why, how much money we have to spend.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_00
 I just want to tell you that we have three new requirements.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_00
 Which is the first one is that the company has decided that teletext is outdated.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_00
 Because of how popular the internet is, nobody uses teletext very much anymore.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_00
 So, we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the remote control.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_00
 They've also suggested that we only use the remote control to control the television.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_00
 Not the VCR or DVD or anything else.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_00
 I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex, it will affect how long it takes us to get it into production the time to market.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_00
 So, we're just going to keep it simple and it'll just control the TV.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_00
 And the other thing was that the company wants the corporate color and slogan to be implemented in the new design.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not entirely sure what the corporate color is.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_00
 It might be yellow because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_03
 And the slogan, like the actual written slogan, or just to embody the idea of the slogan?

0:02:43	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that's the thing.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_00
 Because on the company website, what does it say?

0:02:52	SPEAKER_03
 That's the fashion in electronics.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. I mean, do they... is that something they want to actually written on?

0:02:58	SPEAKER_00
 Because it's quite long.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_00
 Or, yeah, just the idea that I'm not sure.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_00
 Is that something we can discuss as well?

0:03:04	SPEAKER_00
 So, there's the three things.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_00
 It's not to worry about teletext.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_00
 Only control the TV.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_00
 And incorporate the color and slogan of the company.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_00
 So, is everybody okay with any of that? Or do you want me to recap?

0:03:23	SPEAKER_00
 That's all.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_00
 That time for presentations, and he would like to go first.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_02
 I'll go first.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, cool.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_02
 All right, can I still listen to the back yellow?

0:03:40	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah, of course.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_00
 Good going ahead.

0:04:11	None
 So, the technical function design.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_02
 All right, I'm to do the design.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_02
 I've had a look on mine.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_02
 I've had a look at the homepage, which is given a sense of inspiration from previous products.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_02
 I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_02
 And I would like to ask you guys for your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_02
 Unfortunately, we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_02
 I'll have a look at the existing products.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_02
 I found out that it tends to come into two extremes.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_02
 There's either a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons, lots of colors, very confusing.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_02
 You don't know what you're doing.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_02
 In that case, the labeling tends to be very bad.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_02
 There's an example of how you eat the ends.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_02
 I'll show you now.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_02
 You see here, there's a button there and there.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_02
 This one's broke.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry, that one's broke.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_02
 And that one's broke.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_02
 And it doesn't really tell you what it does.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure if you had a look at the other control on that example.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_02
 It's a very simple one.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_02
 It's got only the basic functions.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_02
 But the same size as the hard to use one.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_02
 And it's a bit clunky.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_02
 It's very big and not very much used for actually buttons.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_02
 And it's very hard to access the advanced functions.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_02
 There's nothing, for instance, for a slow motion button.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_02
 My own preferences, I prefer the clunky one.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_02
 It's very easy to use.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_02
 But it does like the advanced functions, which I quite like having on the controls.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_02
 I believe that the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in the drawer.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if you could open the bottom of it.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_02
 I've got few references, and I sure don't know how long we'll go.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_00
 Why would we come to chat away for five minutes or so, I think?

0:06:31	SPEAKER_00
 At most, it's a couple of minutes anyway.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, a lot of what I've read and prepared for this meeting fits and really closely with what Craig's just gone over.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_03
 So in part, I could give you some of my personal preferences, but I could also add some to this, which is just about sort of market research.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_03
 But anyway.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_00
 You'll stick to your area.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_02
 The clunky one is the one in the right.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_03
 Clunky in what sense?

0:06:59	SPEAKER_03
 Like heavier, larger?

0:07:01	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's supposed to be the same size, but it's got much fewer buttons.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_02
 It's ISIS, it's more spread out of bacon.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_02
 You get the idea of this size.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, go very few buttons.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_02
 Sure.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I think, to that other point, I mean, the one on the left looks quite complicated.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_00
 And that PRG, PROG thing is incredibly confusing.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_00
 So, see why you might prefer the simpler design, but yeah, you don't want to lose it on what it does.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe, you know, you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of feel the thing open, I think that's a good idea.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a good idea.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_02
 Do we have any functions that we'd want on it?

0:07:43	SPEAKER_02
 So far, I've got an island off, so it's the channel up and down.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_02
 And the volume up and down.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_02
 There's the very basic you can use by TV.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_00
 And then actual numbers for channels as well, yeah.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_02
 And you see that's how the required one are requested one.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_02
 Which was that?

0:07:59	SPEAKER_02
 The channels, like the numbers?

0:08:01	SPEAKER_03
 The numbers are the up there.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_00
 But I would say that's required.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, there's no way anybody's going to buy a remote control these days, so if she can't actually individually select channels, I mean, would anybody disagree with that?

0:08:13	SPEAKER_00
 What else?

0:08:16	SPEAKER_00
 So don't need to worry about tally text, don't need to worry about VCR.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_00
 Any kind of like display controls at all?

0:08:25	SPEAKER_00
 Do you think we need to worry about, you know, like brightness and contrast?

0:08:28	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I think essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorizing.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_03
 We're saying, well, we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features, but we want them to be in another area.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_03
 Is that right?

0:08:39	SPEAKER_03
 Is that what we're doing?

0:08:40	SPEAKER_03
 Do we're kind of like sorting them?

0:08:43	SPEAKER_03
 Or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have?

0:08:46	SPEAKER_00
 I think are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice?

0:08:50	SPEAKER_02
 To start with, we need to find the exact thing we have to have, not that we can add things at the possible.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, right.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_00
 Well, do you want to maybe just at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a function of this?

0:09:05	SPEAKER_00
 So, so far, just to recap, we've got volume and channel control.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_02
 One in general and skipped certain channels with the numbers.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_00
 Right, okay.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_03
 Well, one way I would look at this, be that we approach the different controls in terms of like control types.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_03
 So that for the user, it's very clear what they want to do, where they go.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_03
 And also think maybe a little bit about what we just want to be easily accessible.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_03
 For example, if we had audio controls, those could be something people set up very rarely.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe they're in a little area, but covered up.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_03
 Things like channel and volume are used all the time.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_03
 So we just have them right out on top, very sort of self-explanatory.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_03
 You know, like one which are just the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_03
 And others that are also available and then others that are concealed.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_00
 And we're just to wrap up quickly on this little section.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_00
 Do you think maybe that's the only kind of essential requirements?

0:10:28	SPEAKER_00
 And there may be just things that would be nice if it could do, would be things like audio, set up and display, set up and things like that.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe like a mute button.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_00
 That's really saying.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_00
 Any of the other things to that at all?

0:10:41	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_00
 If we can move on to the next presentation then please.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_03
 Can this reach, can this plug come across?

0:10:55	SPEAKER_00
 Probably not, actually.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_03
 So why don't I just pick up and...

0:11:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I'll just...

0:11:04	SPEAKER_06
 I'll just...

0:11:19	SPEAKER_03
 Can you go behind me?

0:11:23	SPEAKER_03
 This is so...

0:11:25	SPEAKER_00
 It's so complicated.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_00
 I'm all alone.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_00
 It's so complicated.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_05
 I'm all alone.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_05
 It's so complicated.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_00
 I'm all alone.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_00
 I'm all alone.

0:11:33	None
 I'm all alone.

0:11:34	None
 I'm all alone.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_03
 I'm all alone.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_03
 I'm all alone.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_03
 I'm all alone.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_03
 So I can say already, I don't know whether this is for good or for bad, but there'll be a lot of kind of redundancy in the issues and the...

0:11:47	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, like overlap between what you said.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, for all you know, something.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_03
 Not necessarily a bad thing, but what I've already started doing is I created a slide and in my presentation here, so...

0:11:59	SPEAKER_03
 So that we kind of think what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and mine, because certainly I have a hard time separating things completely.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_03
 I'm hard to know what you're really, really, just told me.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_03
 Where you've just told me impacts a lot on what, like market research, that I've been.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_03
 So how do I get this up?

0:12:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I put function in F8, yeah.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_06
 All right.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_06
 So...

0:12:31	SPEAKER_05
 F8?

0:12:32	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_01
 The blue button.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_01
 Thanks for the control on the left.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, and F8, okay.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_06
 Push it to the left.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's it.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_02
 Again, we need to do the one about maybe this.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you want to?

0:12:58	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, here we go.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_04
 There you go.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_03
 Just before I bring this up, what I'll just say is what I've done is try to collect some information so that I can then relay this to you guys so that it now becomes a collective thing.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_03
 And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding, okay, what are our options?

0:13:16	SPEAKER_03
 What should we decide?

0:13:18	SPEAKER_03
 And do you know what I mean?

0:13:20	SPEAKER_04
 So...

0:13:22	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_00
 Can you...

0:13:34	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_03
 So that makes sense.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_03
 So what I basically, God, is I've just looked into some information and sort of tried to think about how we could review it.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_03
 Now we could...

0:13:47	SPEAKER_03
 And what kind of decisions we could take away from it.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_03
 And then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things, we can think about what are our priorities.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_03
 Because certainly there's lots of different information to go through.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm thinking here about primarily about customer needs that we start with the customer.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_03
 We have what they want and what are issues with existing products.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_03
 I just think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision, which is about fashion and electronics.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_03
 And then as I say, we'd like to prioritize our design features from this.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_03
 So this is what I've found here.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_03
 A lot of this is new to me, so we'll just read two together.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_03
 Users dislike the look and feel of current remote control.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_03
 So if I find them ugly, most people find them ugly.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_03
 The vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_03
 We'll see later, vast majority people would spend more money for slightly more intuitive controls, such as voice recognition.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to...

0:14:55	SPEAKER_03
 We'll look at that in a second.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_03
 Most people use only a very slim portion of all the controls.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_03
 So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this technology.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_03
 They tend to use the most simple controls.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_03
 And overall, they find remote controls to be something they don't really appeal to them.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_03
 So I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like...

0:15:14	SPEAKER_03
 For me, this is sort of like three different inspirations.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_03
 One is that we want something that's high tech, but we want it to seem easy.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_03
 And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high tech side, we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hand.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_03
 Frustrations, they get lost a lot as it came up in our last meeting.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_03
 Takes time to learn how to use them.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_03
 This is why I mentioned Craig was showing us some ideas that we actually try and group control.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_03
 So it doesn't just look like a big panel, kind of like when you look at a new computer keyboard or something that is quite explanatory.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_03
 If you want audio, if you want visual, then you have those.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_03
 And I will admit, I don't know what RSI stands for.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_00
 What's headed Australian, Drew?

0:16:04	SPEAKER_01
 Is installing remote control from the remote people?

0:16:08	SPEAKER_03
 No, that did not come up at all.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_03
 So here's another sort of a review here of the main things.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_03
 I also found that most people would adults at least would pay more for voice recognition.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_03
 Now, apparently we do have access to all the cutting edge technology and remote control.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_03
 So I don't know if that's possible.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_03
 We might consider getting into it.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_03
 And again, here as we sort of move things, starting about how we want to sell and market this.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_03
 I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_03
 It wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_03
 People are not liking the appearance of their products.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_03
 So we want to think about how we can put that into a unit which people like.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_03
 Big priorities.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_03
 So just looking at what Craig's ideas sort of tell me that maybe what we want to do is try and separate the different things that we want to include in this.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_03
 If we do say, well, we want there to be all the technology.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_03
 But we try and make that almost be like optional technology.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's like, I find a lot of TVs these days, something really nice about them is, if you want to just turn them on and off you can, but they have little panels where you click.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_03
 And there's just like tons of features.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_00
 So we want to grip all the different types of functions together.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_00
 That's what I just.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_03
 But I hope here is that I'm putting out this information so we can then say, okay, well, how do we collectively move on with that?

0:17:57	SPEAKER_03
 I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_03
 Although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles and then use that but not let that confine us technologically.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_03
 Any comments on all of that?

0:18:20	SPEAKER_00
 Well, one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're going to be.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_00
 Who's our target audience or target market?

0:18:29	SPEAKER_00
 So if we want something that looks good and is easy to use but has is fairly powerful product, whatever, who do we really want to aim that out?

0:18:41	SPEAKER_03
 Where's the money?

0:18:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, who would have the money to spend?

0:18:46	SPEAKER_00
 If like 25 euro is our selling price and you can imagine, well, I'm not really sure how much that will retail at.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_00
 If somebody is not going to just use the remote that comes with their tally, I suppose they're going to actually go out and buy one.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_00
 So who do you think we're aiming this up?

0:19:03	SPEAKER_01
 I think it will be the mid-range to the high end market in terms of people because 25 euros for remote.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_01
 How much is that?

0:19:12	SPEAKER_01
 About 16, 17 pounds I think?

0:19:14	SPEAKER_01
 Is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote for a remote?

0:19:18	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe not the high end range but maybe middle upish.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know how much I guess you'd be worth.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_01
 Like a simple replacement.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_01
 If you lost your remote and the first thing you just want to go on, this kind of touches on your comments or David.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_03
 These are the age groups which we have information on.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_03
 This is a table of what people would pay more for a certain feature, just give us a rough idea of where the will to spend money on TV equipment is.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_03
 Mostly focused around the 25 age group.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_00
 Do you think we're aiming at a fairly young market then?

0:19:58	SPEAKER_03
 Sort of young professional.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_00
 Do you think then voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider?

0:20:09	SPEAKER_00
 What do you think Craig?

0:20:12	SPEAKER_02
 Well, you don't say it was the adults that were going to be the white vaccination.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_03
 It does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying in terms of that.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_00
 I think we are going to have to narrow it down so let's target these people and give them what they want.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_00
 Because you know, it needs to be some kind of selling point to it.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_00
 So anybody, anything to add, just kind of young professionals, if we are going to include speech recognition, it's kind of between 15 and 35.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_00
 It seems to be like a really high response to that.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_00
 So we could say that was our target.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_01
 Five to 35 is fair to add that in.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_01
 That's more than half a group of people who are willing to at least try to use it.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so 15 to 35 look fairly young, you know, they have a bit of expandable income to spend on this sort of thing.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_01
 I think perhaps that age group is significant as well.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_01
 Because those are people who use the computer, who are familiar with computers in the everyday work.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_01
 I think people who are baby books, I wouldn't say 35, but people are on a foundation above now would not be so dependent and reliant on it.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_01
 Or mobile phone or something like that.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_01
 So people who are gadgety, right?

0:21:30	SPEAKER_01
 Growing up used to, you know, in schools and universities, they got into their working life.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_00
 So they're not shy away from something quite high-tech. That's a good point.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so shall we make the decision to include speech recognition?

0:21:47	SPEAKER_00
 If we can.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_01
 I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, why is that?

0:21:55	SPEAKER_01
 Based on what everybody is saying, you want something simple, you want basic stuff, and you want something that you speak to recognition, you might not be the simplest thing.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_03
 Could it be an on-off thing?

0:22:08	SPEAKER_03
 Like, if you want it.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_01
 We can act a bit in directories.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_01
 We're kind of lock ourselves into a particular kind of technology.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_01
 So focusing on exactly what other features that we're going to say.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_01
 You know, say speech recognition is good for this speech recognition.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_01
 It's not good for this.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_01
 I suggest that we think about speech recognition.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_01
 It's something that can be used to fulfill our functions.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't know that we don't look at the technology, but we'll get the function first.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well, do you want to give us your presentation?

0:22:38	SPEAKER_00
 And then we can, I don't mind if you need good ideas.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_00
 It all deliver presentations and then discuss, but this is highly.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_00
 Good to get ideas out while the friction mind.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_00
 And something that's just occurred to me as well as if we make it speech recognition, if we incorporate speech recognition, that's appealing to people maybe with physical disability as well.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_03
 And not losing, and also it helps in terms of people not losing this, you know, they're saying, oh, I lose it in the couch.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_03
 We're sort of getting into here as mating different design features together.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_02
 One problem is speech recognition is that I've actually seen one of them used.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_02
 And the technology it was, that one wasn't picked by amazement.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_02
 So you end up yelling control for hours, trying to hold up.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_03
 I really have seen one before.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_00
 Do you think maybe we need further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile to incorporate it?

0:23:33	SPEAKER_02
 It's quite expensive to understand.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_04
 That's nice.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_04
 There you go.

0:23:39	None
 Nice.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_01
 Well, this is just the working design.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_01
 Well, this is just what, how I would go about it.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_01
 I guess I try to define, like what we're doing now, try to define what we're trying to get done.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_01
 I think in a practical way, we kind of know what it is.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_01
 We've used it with familiar with it, but really we can't.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_01
 If we have a narrow down, exactly what are the things we're trying to fulfill.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_01
 Like, design the basics.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_01
 I think back in the back of our minds, we know what the basics are.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_01
 It's a change channel, just change volume, but in like specifics, which one of the basics are you trying to target?

0:24:15	SPEAKER_01
 Are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics?

0:24:20	SPEAKER_01
 And I just, the idea is just to get everybody to, I usually have a, have a design as a, as a basic.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 So, you know, things that just start out going, but I guess everybody does have some ideas and I think, I think, you can use that.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, this finding thing is a little bit confusing, so I'll go into the diagram.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_01
 It just explains how the process goes through, from the basic technology point of view, the basic steps that you need in the diagram, this like, hope it works better.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, you need some powerful, the batteries are moving, and that power source is important, because it ties you down to how long the device will last.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of technologies.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_01
 How far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_01
 Like, for example, voice recognition, right?

0:25:16	SPEAKER_01
 That might be constrained because that, you might need to power microphone, you might need to power other things.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_01
 That's one aspect of statement.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, the basic thing is, there's a user interface, where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it, blink their eyes, whatever, you know, and that picks up an input from the user.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_01
 A logic, a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device, and the device has to, you know, push button A, so I would do something with button A to maybe button A to power them.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_01
 And then it needs to be able to send this signal to the device itself, which is a C-level.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_01
 And I think that's, you know, fit and fit, maybe that.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_01
 It's fairly general.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_01
 And I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you, in the way you're thinking like, voice recognition, right?

0:26:13	SPEAKER_01
 If it's something which is important, then we just add more power, rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power, so it's not going to be constrained in that sense.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_01
 But these are functionally, you know, the needs, what, you know, do have to do, okay.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_01
 So I guess the rest of it, I think we should maybe want to go back to what the functions are.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's more relevant to discussion.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_00
 Well, do you want to finish up your presentation?

0:26:38	SPEAKER_01
 Are you all done?

0:26:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, it's just putting the rest of it into words, but it's essentially something.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_01
 You have a computer and a computer.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_03
 And like, on the, I mean, since we're on the topic of the technology, are there any like, what are our options?

0:26:58	SPEAKER_03
 What's, what is, and is this the only way that we go about it?

0:27:03	SPEAKER_03
 Are there other?

0:27:04	SPEAKER_01
 These, these aren't technology options in that sense.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_01
 This is just a basic principle.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_01
 Basic components that I need it.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_01
 For example, if you needed, if needed to add a voice recognition, right, then you use it in the case, would you split, broken down more components, right?

0:27:23	SPEAKER_01
 You have a microphone, the R, something like that.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_00
 So it's just how we're kind of modularizing the whole thing, okay.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_01
 So each component represents one function.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_01
 But I think the basic functions are the logic, the transmitter, and the receiver, okay, and the power are things that you won't have to care about.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_01
 And those are things that based on what you're using the face requires, and we'll add more functionality to it.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_01
 There might be one other consideration, which would be the transmission between the remote control and the TV, for example.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_01
 Are we going to restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies and then the data?

0:28:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_01
 Because that's something you need to actually be physically pointing to.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_00
 Well, a way that was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex, it would affect how long it took us to get this to market.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_00
 So as a suspect, it might be a good idea to restrict our kind of creative influence on this, on the user interface, and not worry so much about how we transmit it.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_00
 Because I mean, it's tried and tested and for ads.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_01
 So they might be a little firm with the transmission, in particular, right now, since we're talking about voice recognition.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_01
 If somebody's going to talk to the device, you really want them to hold it to them.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_01
 You may not require that, but you know, it's something very natural, I guess, to hold it, signal to the user and push a button maybe to start talking about it.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_01
 Then you need to send a signal out.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_01
 So if you're using infrared, the line of sight, say the TV is at that chair, and I'm standing in front of here, and the transmitter is here, it blocks it.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_01
 So in that sense, there's not really a restriction, but there's something you may have to think about later on in the process.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_03
 Not so much.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_03
 And just a clarification before we finish this, is our controller, is it, have the option of being on a standard frequency as all of the other equipment so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment?

0:29:21	SPEAKER_01
 There's not much specific information, but I think that one indication of infrared means that you're just targeting traditional devices.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_00
 Is infrared is something that you can't?

0:29:31	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we've, in the new requirements spec, they said just to focus on a TV, so that's what we should do for now, I think.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_00
 Something I was wondering about with the power, is it worth considering, like having a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries?

0:29:45	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, is that something you really want to go into to think, or should we just consider

0:29:49	SPEAKER_01
 running on regular batteries? From the component point of view, there's added complexity.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_00
 Uh-huh.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_01
 And then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component, you need a docking cradle for example.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_01
 Put it into charge.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_01
 You need to get the user to plug it in.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_01
 Most users already use the value of buying batteries and putting it in for the whole time.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_01
 Unless the controller is going to consume a lot of batteries, like, it's going to run through like, the batteries a month, then I don't think you charge about something.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so just stick to regular, okay.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_00
 Um, right.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_00
 So, busy, the, um, I'm just going to just recap.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_00
 When I said at the start, it was that, um, the, the whole point of this meeting was to absolutely finalize who we're going to aim this at.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_00
 And what exactly the product's going to do.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_00
 So, um, just to recap on, are we all happy about the idea of, um, aiming the product at, um, the 15 to 35 bracket.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_00
 Um, and also the, the, the actual functions of what it's going to do.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_00
 Do you want to recap on that, Craig?

0:31:03	SPEAKER_02
 Um, I think we used to say that it was going to be the most basic stuff possible.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_02
 Um, on and off, up and down the channel, up and down volume.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_02
 And skip to the channel.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_03
 And is it going to include any of the, uh, the more advanced features?

0:31:19	SPEAKER_03
 Are we going to eliminate those?

0:31:21	SPEAKER_02
 Um, I think we include you.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_02
 But apart from that, um, I think you just go for the simplest.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_03
 Is it, is it, is it, is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under, like sort of under a door?

0:31:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's as optional function.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_03
 What, what I might be a bit worried about is if someone was, uh, had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that, with their controller and then, and then they, you know, they get ours.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't, it doesn't have that.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if that'd be a problem.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_01
 And I think that you're saying about categorizing the people.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_01
 Um, maybe I could suggest we, we think that that is, we simple categories.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_01
 One of the audio controls, um, will be video control.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_01
 So, you know, this can be the same.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_01
 I think, I mean, we're also going to be a little bit more, a little bit more of the audio device.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_01
 Um, this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_01
 But I think that, um, from a manufacturer, for one of these, yeah, if I'm designing the device, but I think, from the point of view of the person using it, you know, a TV is something you see and something you hear, um, and there's something they do, but there's things to it like, turning on and turning off.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_01
 So what we could have, like, two buckets, and you could scale things into, like, if you want this to turn that square into there.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:37	SPEAKER_01
 and it's basic, but non-basic.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, okay.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_01
 It might help you.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_01
 It'll be the night of the day.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_01
 And it would actually help you with the component build as well.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, great.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well, I've got a kind of, got five minutes to wrap up now.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_00
 Next thing we're doing is having lunch.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_00
 Woo-hoo.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_00
 And then we're gonna have 30 minutes of working on the next stage.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_00
 So I'll be pulling the minutes of this meeting into the project documents folder.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_00
 So I guess just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next, well, in the 30 minutes after lunch anyway.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_00
 For our industrial designer, you're gonna be thinking about the components concept.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_00
 User-in-fist designer, you're gonna be thinking about our user interface and marketing.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_00
 You're gonna be thinking what trend watching and you'll all get specific instructions as well.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_00
 So I know just to ask now, if you've got anything else you thought about while we've been talking.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_00
 And do you wanna start with David, then I'll just say at all.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_00
 No, okay.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, just, I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up, should we agree for sake of sort of clarity and when we resume that we'll use this idea, David's proposal, we think of these three sort of buckets.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah, I think we've got a good idea.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_03
 I think we've got the best idea.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, we're talking about this.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_02
 Should we do that?

0:34:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, great.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_02
 Just about the three buckets.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_02
 What would go in the device functions one?

0:34:08	SPEAKER_01
 Things like on off.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_01
 Because they don't have anything to do with what you see.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, in terms of picture and the entertainment value.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_01
 So, in channel.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_01
 In channel.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_01
 Because the on off also goes, you know, like on off like power, not on off sound.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_01
 On off video, although you don't turn off some TV.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_01
 But you might wanna turn off the sound so you wanna pick up the phone and mute button.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_01
 You have a choice of putting it onto others or device.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_01
 Device is basically anything we can't categorize.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so you're gonna have audio, which is gonna be like, you know, you base settings and actual volume.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_00
 Anything to do with what you hear, right?

0:34:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_00
 Put that into audio.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, and then visual.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_00
 There's anything that you can see.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_00
 So brightness, contrast, things like that.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_00
 And then just actual device things like what channel you're watching, turning on and off, stuff like that.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_03
 And I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the device category, there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more random,

0:35:17	SPEAKER_01
 which we can go other place to push. Yeah.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_01
 Somewhere there.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_01
 Even if it doesn't matter clearly, what happens is that people at least have some in their mind.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_01
 It's easy to use.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's one thing that, and I guess from the phone at point of view, as well as the speaker.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_00
 So yeah, I guess just things to think about are, you know, like the fact that's got to look good because if you were targeting this up, something maybe kind of quirky and design, maybe make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold, you know, things like that.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_00
 So I guess that's it.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_00
 The meeting over.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_04
 Now we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us.

0:37:56	None
 Yes.

0:37:57	None
 Yes.

0:37:57	None
 Hm.

0:38:01	None
 Yes.

0:38:04	None
 Colleague.
