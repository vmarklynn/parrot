0:00:00	None
 You see that?

0:00:01	None
 You can see that.

0:00:02	None
 Okay.

0:00:03	None
 So I'll take you.

0:00:04	None
 You go.

0:00:05	None
 You see that?

0:00:06	None
 Easy.

0:00:07	None
 Okay.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_04
 So let's start our second meeting on conceptual design.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_04
 So as the previous meeting I will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we will have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we will close the session.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_04
 So I will first...

0:01:13	SPEAKER_00
 Are you doing the minutes first or?

0:01:17	SPEAKER_04
 What?

0:01:18	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_04
 I think I will let our user interface and designer speak first.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_04
 Mr. David Jordan.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_04
 So I will...

0:01:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_04
 Technical...

0:01:36	SPEAKER_04
 That's this one?

0:01:37	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_04
 Interface.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_04
 This.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_01
 So first I will present the concept of user interface.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_01
 There are three concepts in the user interface.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_01
 The first one is the Google controller.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_01
 The second is the fancy controller.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_01
 That's why it's an intelligent controller.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_01
 So there are three concepts in our controller.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_01
 Next I will explain my main.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_01
 The first is the Google controller.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_01
 So I want the controller to be easy to use but with the sophisticated functions.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_01
 So it's a combination of easy to use and the sophisticated functions.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_01
 This is the first concept of our controller.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_01
 The second concept is the fancy controller.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_01
 So we want to give the customer the impression that our controller is very attractive.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_01
 We can easily recognize our controller among a lot of products.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_01
 So the user interface would be very cute.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_01
 Very attractive.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_01
 Such as these.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_01
 There are several examples in these slides.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_01
 The video is very interesting.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_01
 It's very big.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_01
 It's easy for me to recognize it.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_04
 Why not?

0:03:17	SPEAKER_04
 We'll have big discussion with the last suppose after that.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_01
 So the last concept is the intelligent.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_01
 We want our controller to be smart.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe we should use some technology such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_01
 So we need to have some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and gesture recognition.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_01
 With these advanced features, I think we can attract a lot of users.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_01
 Something else?

0:04:02	SPEAKER_01
 Nope.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_01
 This is the three concepts of our...

0:04:05	SPEAKER_04
 I just have one question.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_04
 You said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_04
 As the expert told us, most of the people want to use the remote control to zap between channels.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_04
 Do you think they will be able to use gestures?

0:04:28	SPEAKER_04
 If they do all the time the same gesture, as you said previously in the last meeting, maybe they will get injuries.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_00
 Because of that?

0:04:36	SPEAKER_04
 Or if you say channel 3, channel 3, 2, 3, 4, 6, 5, I think they will be born after a while.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_04
 You don't think so?

0:04:44	SPEAKER_01
 I think sometimes it's very convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_01
 For example, if you cannot find your controller, you can just speak something such as one.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_04
 And suppose you got a call, you have a mute remote controller.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_01
 So you can use gestures?

0:05:07	SPEAKER_01
 That's the problem.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_00
 How is it very easy to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition?

0:05:15	SPEAKER_01
 For limited vocabulary speech recognition, it's very reliable.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_01
 And for limited vocabulary speech recognition, it's also very...

0:05:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but suppose you have a family watching TV.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_04
 And if they want to use their private remote control in the same time, do you think it will work?

0:05:31	SPEAKER_04
 Everybody wants to change channels at the same time?

0:05:34	SPEAKER_00
 But this would never happen anyway.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, they cannot speak at the same time.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_04
 If you have one brother and one sister, they want to watch their favorite TV program.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_04
 So they say, oh, channel 4, channel 3, channel 4.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so you have all the time.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_02
 If the same thing can happen, even using this kind of remote control.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think so.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_04
 But do you have the remote control?

0:05:53	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe you can record with you.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_04
 You're not obliged to share.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, okay, okay.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_00
 You mean it could be a problem for this kind of...

0:05:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we can.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_01
 That's the advantage of intelligent control.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_01
 Even you have the control.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_00
 You have the control.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_01
 I can.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_01
 I can say it's channel 3.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_01
 So it's...

0:06:07	SPEAKER_01
 This is the disadvantage.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's the disadvantage.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_04
 This is the advantage.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, maybe you can have a switching more to pass from, you know, voice control to...

0:06:15	SPEAKER_04
 But one other question, how much will it cost?

0:06:19	SPEAKER_02
 How much can it be?

0:06:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because I suppose we need to do research.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_04
 Do you have something working?

0:06:24	SPEAKER_04
 No, we just...

0:06:25	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, if you use something efficient.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_01
 You can use it on the efficient.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_01
 Basically.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_01
 No, we just have some cooperation with some research institute.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_01
 We don't have to do some basic research on this.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_04
 So you think it won't cost in...

0:06:39	SPEAKER_04
 Not a lot for us?

0:06:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think it's...

0:06:41	SPEAKER_01
 Because this technology is...

0:06:44	SPEAKER_01
 For limited, or limited, or lack-seeking recognition.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_01
 It's very...

0:06:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, absolutely.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_00
 But it's changing how the remote control is going to be built.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_00
 Because then you need...

0:06:58	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, this doesn't have the power to do recognition, for example.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_02
 You have also the language, for example.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_01
 Because it has to be universal.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I agree with some.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_01
 But it's very small.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_01
 So that's not a problem.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but there's one problem that Baba talked about.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_04
 It's the international remote control.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_04
 We need something that is international.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_04
 Suppose we want to sell it in France.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_04
 The recognition system will be able to understand French.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_04
 If you want to go to England, it will be able to understand English.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, the key...

0:07:35	SPEAKER_01
 This could be downloaded by the way.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_01
 The key feature of our control is that it has some...

0:07:42	SPEAKER_01
 Some adaptation.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_01
 We need...

0:07:47	SPEAKER_01
 It means when you sell this control in China, it can recognize Chinese.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_01
 If you sell this control, it's very much French.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_04
 It's a very smart control image.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_04
 And with no increase in the production price of the remote control.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_01
 Because of this technology has already been developed.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_02
 But the problem is how to...

0:08:09	SPEAKER_02
 You know, if this is a push button controller, you can send this remote control everywhere in the world.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_02
 The same one.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_02
 If you have the language, you have to develop for it.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_02
 We have to do language adaptation.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_02
 But first, you have to do one.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_01
 Because even for different families, we have to do...

0:08:30	SPEAKER_01
 Really?

0:08:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we have to do adaptation too.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but it seems to be quite complex.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we have to take care of the 12-year-olds.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_04
 And what about voice recognition?

0:08:40	SPEAKER_04
 Do we have microphones?

0:08:41	SPEAKER_04
 And where will we be there?

0:08:43	SPEAKER_04
 Do you think we are far from television to work?

0:08:46	SPEAKER_01
 I think so.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_01
 There's another problem.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_01
 Because you don't have to wear a microphone.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_01
 The microphone is embedded in the controller.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but where is the controller?

0:08:58	SPEAKER_01
 There is a controller.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 Is it your family?

0:09:02	SPEAKER_01
 In your home?

0:09:03	SPEAKER_01
 No, but then it's...

0:09:04	SPEAKER_04
 Here it's an object.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_04
 But here you say you want to use a...

0:09:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, you can embed it in the microphone.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but what is the use of voice or just recognition if you have remote controller like this, if you have an object.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_04
 If you want to use voice or just you need to be free.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_04
 To talk to it.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_04
 Without any objects, you just want to interact with the...

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah, just put the controller here.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_01
 Then you...

0:09:28	SPEAKER_01
 If you say one, you say a command.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_01
 And you do your gesture.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but you can lose it.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's...

0:09:37	SPEAKER_02
 If you lose it.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_02
 So, for example, if it is somewhere in the room, maybe if it is in the table there, it's channel one and the remote controller gives audio to the TV to switch the screen.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so you can build to kind of black box and put it on TV just to recognize gestures and voice.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but so you need the camera and a microphone.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_00
 Oh.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_00
 So you would still have the buttons.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_00
 Or do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition?

0:10:07	SPEAKER_00
 Or you still have the possibility to use buttons?

0:10:11	SPEAKER_01
 I think it would give the flexibility to the user.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so you...

0:10:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but...

0:10:17	SPEAKER_01
 You can see that it has a switch from via modality to another.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_00
 It's a bit risky.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_04
 I think so, maybe it will be quite...

0:10:25	SPEAKER_04
 Quite attractive.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_02
 I think that switching from one country to another will be a problem.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_01
 So, if you do language adaptation, there should be no problem.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but...

0:10:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_01
 We should have confidence in technology.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we should.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_04
 So, what do you think, which are the controllers you'd prefer?

0:10:57	SPEAKER_05
 What?

0:10:58	SPEAKER_04
 Which kind of controller would you prefer to use?

0:11:01	SPEAKER_04
 You as a remote controller user?

0:11:03	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, I'm sure if the user pays the same price, he's happy to have recognition.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_00
 Of each other.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_00
 But if it like doubles, I think he needs a controller that is very reliable.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_04
 So, I think it would be better not to do nientelegen controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe try to mix the Google controller and a fancy controller.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_04
 Just one.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_04
 Do you have something controller, which is an intelligent controller?

0:11:33	SPEAKER_04
 Easy to use, sophisticated and fancy?

0:11:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but if you stick to the first two parts, so what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market?

0:11:47	SPEAKER_01
 There's no features of our controller.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_01
 So, is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features?

0:11:55	SPEAKER_01
 No, I mean, do you replace your controller with a controller with similar function?

0:12:01	SPEAKER_01
 If you do not have some function, I'd prefer that.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_02
 Some function like for browsing in internet, or something like that.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_02
 But I think a user needs...

0:12:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's not the function of the controller.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_01
 That's the function of TV.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_01
 You can replace it with a new TV with internet browser.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_00
 No, but you need a new remote controller then.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_00
 Because if you want to browse internet, or...

0:12:26	SPEAKER_00
 If you want to type something, or...

0:12:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, if you want to send a mail from...

0:12:30	SPEAKER_01
 It's not the only issue of controller.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_01
 It's also the issue of the TV.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_02
 Because the problem I can see is the voice or gesture.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_02
 Because we can have enough...

0:12:41	SPEAKER_01
 For example, we cannot rely 100% on these features to use the controller.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_01
 But the features of our controller, such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 But you seldom use it in your mobile.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_01
 But when you choose a new mobile, you choose the one with voice recognition.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_01
 The feature is not 100% reliable, but it's a feature to distinguish our product from other products.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but we want something that works all the time.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_04
 Every day, every hour.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_04
 For everyone.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_01
 If you already have a product, it works 100% reliable.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_01
 Would you replace it with another one?

0:13:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, one else.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_00
 For example, we would like to have a Google-like controller.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_00
 I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_00
 Google is simple, works fine.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_00
 So I guess you can have a remote control that is really basic, simple, and works fine.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_00
 It's already a lot.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_01
 But there's no big difference between the traditional controller.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_00
 If he has something that works fine and is really fancy, looks nice.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_00
 It's easy to use.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_01
 It's easy to use.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_01
 Not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_01
 It does no key feature in the new controller.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_00
 That's the problem.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_00
 But you have to think the user is the one who will buy the product then.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_04
 So let's go to the industrial designer.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe I would be able to take a decision after that.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_04
 So two.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, basically two.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_02
 Working.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_02
 Design.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_02
 So, I can...

0:15:01	SPEAKER_02
 Can you go to the next one?

0:15:03	SPEAKER_02
 It's not this one.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_02
 It's not working this one.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_02
 Component.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_02
 So this is to describe to you.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_02
 What?

0:15:17	SPEAKER_02
 I guess.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_04
 I think there's something wrong with your...

0:15:21	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe you record it somewhere else.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think so.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_03
 Participate one.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_01
 Participate one.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_04
 Interface concept.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_03
 Oh.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe I record it directly on the computer.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_04
 It seems that we have a problem with the...

0:16:07	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if you remember what you had to say or...

0:16:10	SPEAKER_02
 I can say it to you without...

0:16:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so...

0:16:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, maybe we can first come to...

0:16:15	SPEAKER_04
 No, I think it would be more interesting to talk with...

0:16:18	SPEAKER_01
 It's from...

0:16:19	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's more interesting than you can.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_04
 It will add some more information and I think it would be interesting after you presentation to have some...

0:16:30	SPEAKER_04
 Babas presentation.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_02
 In my presentation, I don't have here but...

0:16:37	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_02
 It was in fact to design...

0:16:40	SPEAKER_02
 To show you the design of what is inside...

0:16:43	SPEAKER_02
 What is inside and what has a different component of the...

0:16:47	SPEAKER_02
 of the remote control.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_02
 So it will be interesting so I could show you some...

0:16:53	SPEAKER_02
 some picture of what is inside.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_02
 So in fact, something I want to discuss is...

0:17:03	SPEAKER_02
 What kind of matter are you going to use?

0:17:05	SPEAKER_02
 So it will be a wooden...

0:17:08	SPEAKER_02
 wooden remote control or...

0:17:12	SPEAKER_02
 a plastic remote control like this one.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_02
 So in which...

0:17:19	SPEAKER_02
 which can be the different button.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_02
 So it can be some...

0:17:25	SPEAKER_02
 you know, classic push button like this one.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_02
 Or you have also some button like LCD where you know...

0:17:32	SPEAKER_02
 the buttons are...

0:17:33	SPEAKER_02
 the buttons are unlighted during the night or you know...

0:17:36	SPEAKER_02
 You can see them in the darkness.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_02
 And the other thing I want to discuss also is...

0:17:42	SPEAKER_02
 which kind of...

0:17:44	SPEAKER_02
 electric elementation we want to have.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_02
 So we need to be for example...

0:17:50	SPEAKER_02
 solar energy...

0:17:52	SPEAKER_02
 or will it be a battery like the classical battery.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_02
 So and I think that for example for the elementation...

0:17:59	SPEAKER_02
 it would be good to have...

0:18:02	SPEAKER_02
 both of them.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_02
 So for example in some country where you are in the countryside...

0:18:08	SPEAKER_02
 and you are far from the cities.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_02
 For example in some places in...

0:18:14	SPEAKER_02
 in Stenegal.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_02
 So if you have electricity...

0:18:17	SPEAKER_02
 if you have solar...

0:18:18	SPEAKER_02
 elementation you just... when you want to have...

0:18:22	SPEAKER_02
 recharge your remote control power...

0:18:25	SPEAKER_02
 you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can comment.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_02
 So it can be interesting for people to have this kind of...

0:18:31	SPEAKER_02
 it can be something interesting to make people buy it.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think it's an added value to the remote control.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_04
 And maybe it can attract all the...

0:18:40	SPEAKER_04
 ecological consumers.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_04
 And the price of adding this solar battery...

0:18:48	SPEAKER_04
 would it be something really that will increase the price of production or...

0:18:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_02
 In fact having them both...

0:18:57	SPEAKER_02
 if you want to have battery...

0:19:00	SPEAKER_02
 regular battery and...

0:19:02	SPEAKER_02
 and the solar energy battery...

0:19:05	SPEAKER_02
 it could be...

0:19:06	SPEAKER_02
 it will add a little bit of the price.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 But it will be another value also that will be compensated.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:19:16	SPEAKER_04
 And what about the...

0:19:19	SPEAKER_04
 materials?

0:19:20	SPEAKER_02
 And the materials...

0:19:22	SPEAKER_02
 it depends. For example, if you have wooden material it can be more...

0:19:26	SPEAKER_02
 the plastic material is more common.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_02
 It's very resistant.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_02
 But you know, something wooden will be like...

0:19:33	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know...

0:19:34	SPEAKER_02
 special high class.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and if you...

0:19:38	SPEAKER_04
 we want to put fashion and electronics...

0:19:40	SPEAKER_04
 maybe we can try to do something we would.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, even if it is not completely wood...

0:19:44	SPEAKER_02
 but just a part of the...

0:19:46	SPEAKER_02
 wooden, in wood and...

0:19:48	SPEAKER_02
 it can be interesting.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, it's interesting to be interesting.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_02
 So the last point is...

0:19:54	SPEAKER_02
 we do want to have some very cheap...

0:20:00	SPEAKER_02
 integrated circuits, chips...

0:20:02	SPEAKER_02
 or do we have low level or...

0:20:05	SPEAKER_02
 very...

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 very expensive. It depends.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_02
 But I think that low level will be...

0:20:10	SPEAKER_02
 it is an entry-migod.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we want something easy to use.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_04
 So I think maybe something very low level would be enough.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_04
 And you think that we will be...

0:20:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think it will fit on the price.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_02
 You want 12 euros.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_04
 So what about the buttons?

0:20:26	SPEAKER_02
 I think the buttons...

0:20:28	SPEAKER_02
 I prefer...

0:20:29	SPEAKER_02
 the LCD...

0:20:31	SPEAKER_02
 lighted buttons.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_02
 Because you know, it's...

0:20:35	SPEAKER_02
 and you're in the dark, it's fashion and...

0:20:38	SPEAKER_02
 it's related to how beautiful it is.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_02
 So if you want to watch TV in the darkness...

0:20:43	SPEAKER_02
 or if you want to find your...

0:20:46	SPEAKER_02
 your remote control that is lost in the darkness, it's very easy.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_00
 What about the touch screen?

0:20:55	SPEAKER_00
 For example...

0:20:57	SPEAKER_00
 it's expensive, I guess.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_02
 I think the touch screen...

0:21:03	SPEAKER_02
 will be as expensive as the LCD button.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_02
 And it is a kind of design.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_02
 It can be also interesting to have this kind of...

0:21:17	SPEAKER_01
 So you got the email?

0:21:19	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_04
 I think we have only...

0:21:24	SPEAKER_04
 five minutes left.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_04
 Touchpins 4.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_04
 Functional requirements.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_00
 No train watching.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_00
 Here's the one.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_04
 This one?

0:21:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_00
 I think so.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:21:45	SPEAKER_00
 just to meet the user requirements...

0:21:48	SPEAKER_00
 I've just...

0:21:49	SPEAKER_00
 do a short analysis of the remote control market.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_00
 And...

0:21:54	SPEAKER_00
 to kind of...

0:21:58	SPEAKER_00
 have a better overview of what's the fashion in...

0:22:00	SPEAKER_00
 general I've checked more than only the...

0:22:03	SPEAKER_00
 remote control market.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:22:06	SPEAKER_00
 next.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_00
 So again, it's pretty much similar to what I've said...

0:22:11	SPEAKER_00
 in the previous meeting.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_00
 User really wants a fancy look and feel.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_00
 They are not so interested in a functional look and feel.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_00
 Like the one you've shown David with all the buttons.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_00
 I mean...

0:22:25	SPEAKER_00
 it sounds good technically, but it's not what they want.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:22:30	SPEAKER_00
 second point, they still want it to be technologically innovative.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the...

0:22:37	SPEAKER_00
 speech recognition and so on.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_00
 At the same time, it's important that it's easy to use.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_00
 So where the three first points from the remote control...

0:22:48	SPEAKER_00
 analysis.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_00
 Now if we look at fashion in general...

0:22:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_00
 What we really see this year is that...

0:22:59	SPEAKER_00
 everything from clothing to shoes and furniture...

0:23:03	SPEAKER_00
 is inspired by fruits and vegetables.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_00
 So I think we really have to...

0:23:09	SPEAKER_00
 take this into account for the design of the...

0:23:12	SPEAKER_00
 thing.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_00
 Because it's really what people want.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_00
 Even if it's in general fashion, we want it to be in the...

0:23:20	SPEAKER_00
 remote control.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_00
 And then...

0:23:25	SPEAKER_00
 if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points...

0:23:28	SPEAKER_00
 fancy looking field has...

0:23:30	SPEAKER_00
 underscore of seven.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_00
 We'll have six as importance.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_00
 The remote control has to be technologically innovative.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_00
 It's three.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_00
 Then easy to use.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_00
 It's not so important actually with respect to other ones.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_00
 So we see fancy looking field is the most important one.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_00
 And then if we combine this with the fashion from Milan and Paris...

0:23:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's fruits and vegetables.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_00
 We go to the fruits and vegetables.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_00
 And the other point I haven't mentioned is...

0:23:59	SPEAKER_00
 people want to have a spongy touch.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_00
 So this maybe doesn't really fit with the wood and design.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_02
 But the product is which kind of material do you need to be spongy?

0:24:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_00
 This would be like plastic like...

0:24:21	SPEAKER_00
 Rubber like...

0:24:24	SPEAKER_00
 device.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_00
 That was the main point I think from the trend in fashion.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_04
 So we have to take decisions about the component concepts, about the energy.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_04
 So as you say you want something technologically innovative.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe using solar energy.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, solar I think it's...

0:24:50	SPEAKER_04
 With battery would be something interesting.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe it would attract...

0:24:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_02
 It would be...

0:24:58	SPEAKER_04
 Pro-ecology consumers.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_04
 Chip and print.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_04
 So you propose lollable chips would be enough to have something...

0:25:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_04
 Working well.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_04
 Case.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_04
 Lady.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_04
 So you think...

0:25:17	None
 Ooh, case.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_04
 Something spongy.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_04
 No wood.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe not wood.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe not the part you're touching.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe you can have wood for example in the bottom.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, maybe the base.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe the other design you want.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_02
 It's natural.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's natural.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_02
 Feeling it's natural.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe we can stay with wood.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_02
 It can be correlated to energy.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_02
 So for the marketing aspect.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy...

0:25:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's still fashion.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_00
 But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, something that you can enter in.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_04
 And what about the user interface concept?

0:26:11	SPEAKER_02
 Google and...

0:26:12	SPEAKER_04
 Google and fancy.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_02
 And fancy.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_02
 How about the voice?

0:26:16	SPEAKER_04
 Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested in how...

0:26:31	SPEAKER_02
 It is an interesting concept to have voice control.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_01
 Smart control.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_02
 And the point is we can enter that if you have voice control why not to put it directly on the TV.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_02
 You speak directly to the TV.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_02
 You don't need a remote control actually.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but you need to receive it to recognize gestures and the voice.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_02
 It will be embedded on the TV and not on a remote control.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_04
 That's true.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. I don't know.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe we're just focused on the Google controller plus the fancy controller.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe try to mix these two concepts together just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with low level chips and wood.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, good.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_04
 And LCD buttons.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_04
 I think for the sublimation, the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_02
 What can we say a sublimation through interface?

0:27:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, for the interface something added value.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_02
 I think the sublimation can be the voice.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_02
 It is not the most important way. It can be a part of...

0:28:10	SPEAKER_04
 With a module, you mean a remote control with a module if you want, you can just use commands, words and use them when you don't want to use different things.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_02
 Even it is for just some keys like switching channels one, two, three, four.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_02
 Turning the TV off or off.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_02
 That will be a complex command but easy command.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_04
 So adding some vocal commands.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_04
 Simple ones.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, simple ones.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_04
 So next meeting will start in 30 minutes so you will have to work in your direction.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_04
 So you will have to work on the look and feel design to add the easy to use powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the simple vocal commands.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_04
 Vocal commands recognition.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_04
 You will have to work more on the spongy way to add spongy touch to the buttons and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think we will have to evaluate the product.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_04
 And remember as I said last meeting we really have to build a fashion remote control and the color of the society will be really...

0:30:04	SPEAKER_04
 It will be seen in the remote control.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_04
 So you will have Baba and David Jordan, you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us a clay remote control.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_04
 So you will have to model something.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_04
 And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_04
 So no more questions we can close the session.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:30:37	None
 So...

0:31:03	None
 So...
