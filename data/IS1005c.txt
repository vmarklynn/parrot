 Hanna, Hello, This meeting should be focused on conceptual design of the remote control.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_03
 The goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end of the concept I think the last time we talked about and we had a rough idea of what is going to be but at the end of this meeting we have to reach a decision.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_03
 So, we will have again three presentations from all of you and I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to have a long discussion and decisions.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_03
 So, we want to start.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_01
 I so...

0:01:34	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_01
 No, no.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_01
 You get a start.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, I'll start.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_00
 Can you open my presentation please?

0:01:40	SPEAKER_00
 Good.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_00
 The number four.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_03
 I'm trying this one.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_00
 Can you pass the mouse please?

0:02:03	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, that's fine.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_00
 So, basically I just want to present to you some recent results we've had from looking at some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_00
 Fashion trends we got from talking to our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_00
 So, from our market research, basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel as opposed to a functional look and feel is our number one priority.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_00
 Fancy is the highest priority.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_00
 Secondly, that our remote control needs to be technologically innovative.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_00
 So, this is number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_00
 And thirdly, the easiness of use is important as well but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_00
 From our fashion people in Paris and Milan, we've discovered that this year fruit, the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in clothes, shoes and furniture.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_00
 So, I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_00
 And also, the feel of material this year is expected to be spongy.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_00
 So, hopefully our remote control reflects that in some way.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_02
 What does it mean spongy?

0:03:57	SPEAKER_00
 Sort of squishy.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_00
 Like soft or something?

0:04:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, soft. Like a sponge.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_00
 So, in conclusion, our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_00
 It has lots of technology in it.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_00
 Somehow, we'd be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with this spongy feel.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_00
 And that's easy to use.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_00
 And from our last meeting, Fabian taught us that one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of the real reaction company.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_03
 Is it to use?

0:04:43	SPEAKER_03
 As much as important and technology of fancy things.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_03
 It's less important, right?

0:04:48	SPEAKER_00
 Less important.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_00
 So, fancy-ness first and then 2.5 is important as that is technology.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_00
 And then half important as technology is easy to use.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_03
 So, Ahmed, can you?

0:05:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, please.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_01
 I'll show the presentation number 3.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_02
 I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. And number 3.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_03
 This one?

0:05:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_01
 I just could you please check if it is the first one or the second?

0:05:37	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, no, it's the first one.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_01
 The second one.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's not this one.

0:05:47	None
 Okay.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_01
 So, I'm going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_01
 I think the feature is more important than being fancy, but we can discuss about it later.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_01
 Generally, this remote control should be something in my opinion.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_01
 The first feature is just to be easy to use.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_01
 So, the more frequent buttons should be larger, they should be placed in a good position inside the remote control.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_01
 And I can conclude like this that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_01
 We shouldn't need to open a book and start reading and learning how to use this remote control.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_01
 So, what I found out that, as I said, I think it's better to put more frequent buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_01
 And they should be bigger in size.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_01
 The shape of remote control should be in a way which should be taken easily in hand, it should not be completed like a cube.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_01
 It should have round edge, so then it's easier and maybe just like some toys, some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_01
 And also, because customer doesn't like to buy a glass of battery, it should not consume a glass of energy.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. And my personal preference is, as I said, just putting these buttons in special places and cover some buttons which are not used that much, like settings buttons, like mobile phones, usually some mobile phones cover the dialing number part.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_01
 So, we can cover these buttons which are not used or number buttons for the channels and just put volume change or channel change buttons in the remote control.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_01
 And if the user needed to do some more complex tasks, he can open the cover and change settings or something like this.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_01
 And also, I think if we put some buttons in size of the remote control, it can be used easier, not unremote control. I don't know if I can explain well, but just in size, for example, sliding or rolling stuff, if we put it in size, then we can easily manipulate it with a thumb.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_01
 So, it can be another preference. And I don't know, but I think you, the specific recognizer can be good. I know that it consumes lots of energy, but if we do it in some way, that it slips when there is no sound and when it detects some sound, it may consume less energy.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_01
 And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new. So, it may not be very useful, but because it's new people may buy it.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_01
 I personally think there should be a big difference between something, otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so good news for me, for me from Hamet, but Benius from Bob, obviously because it's a pointy design, I don't know if it's an engine, but...

0:10:24	SPEAKER_02
 Could you please go beyond opening? Yeah, I'm present too. And which one? Probably the first one, I'm not sure, but the first one. Most of the things I have to write myself on this board, but yeah, that's it.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_02
 It's only this slide. Yeah, this is just one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just found this, that our company developed seven fingers or an inch TFT screen, which is good news for us since we wanted to include the display there.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_02
 So, I probably draw it down the overall scheme. This is the stuff that I can use.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_02
 First thing is this will be the overall shape. No, I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device, but the shape of the inside of the device.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_02
 So there will be some circuit for the power, so say power circuit here.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_02
 The main energy will be taken from batteries. And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there, we must use additional source of energy, which I found the best is to use the solar cells, which can supply everything.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_02
 I was computing all the things related to the speech recognition and it's okay to use just two batteries and solar cells, so no problem. There can be also solar cells.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_02
 The main board with all the circuits will take at least 7 to 7 centimeters. So this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_02
 So at least 7 to 7, it depends where you put your screen, because the screen is 7 inch, so it depends when you where you put it as a matter.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_02
 It's just one cord from the main board to the screen, which can be elsewhere. So this will be TFT.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_02
 And on the main board, we have the interface to the microphone, which is somewhere. Say here, interface to the microphone, then the graphical card for the TFT.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_02
 And the third unit is the good news is that we decided to use the infrared unit, because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infrared, including all the stuff inside, so it will be very cheap for us.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_02
 So infrared here. So once again, the overall requirement is 7 to 7 centimeters for the board, which can be spongy, but has to be this size.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_02
 And the TFT, which is 7 inches. I have to check what I want to do.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_02
 From my point of view, I don't care about the material used for the overall device.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_03
 Can you fit any, for example, the TFT or any electronic device in a spongy thing, or is there any problem for that?

0:14:18	SPEAKER_03
 Or could the electronic card on a spongy thing, can imagine it could be a problem?

0:14:26	SPEAKER_02
 All these things in this box are okay to put in any shape, basically. But we have to take care of the TFT sponginess. Maybe it's a good feature, since it takes, if it's around the TFT, then it's good, because it just keeps it safe.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_01
 Or maybe it's a hard shell inside, and maybe it puts electronic in a box and spongy thing around.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_02
 Which is that? Well, it's maybe related to the UI.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_02
 Can I ask a question?

0:15:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's all for me.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_00
 This 7-inch TFT screen. How big is it in reality?

0:15:05	SPEAKER_02
 Well, 7 to 7 inches.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_00
 So like that?

0:15:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_00
 That's quite big. We decided that we're going to use this TFT screen.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think it's 7 by 7, I think it's 7.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_03
 To be honest, I was like, usually when this thing is 7 inches.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_03
 Even that is still like this big.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know, I don't know, one each.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_02
 Honestly speaking, I was thinking that it was 7 centimeters initially, but I think we can cut it.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, no problem.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_02
 Because then the size of the graphic card will be one-fourth.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_00
 So, yeah, but no problem to need to cut this screen.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so for the same price, we have four screens now.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_00
 So what's the size of the device?

0:16:02	SPEAKER_02
 Well, this is almost nothing. 7 to 7, 2 at least, some 3 millimeters or something.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_00
 Even from my perspective, 7 to 7 centimeters by 7 centimeters is still...

0:16:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but we wanted to put some stuff like that.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 Because if it's too small, we can lose it at home.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_03
 What's user ones? They want a small remote control?

0:16:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, small remote control.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_00
 It should be the big one.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_00
 But is something that 7 centimeters square? Easy to hold.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I think so. If the roller buttons are on the side, you don't have to catch it like that.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_02
 But just like this and you know, follow, follow.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that's, there's no task for me, but...

0:16:51	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe you can finish your presentation enough to discuss this.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, thanks. That's it.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we have a lot... we have to take decision today.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we have some more to finalize our ID and take decisions.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_03
 First, I think energy is a key problem because it depends what can we have as feature if we use only batteries, for example, or something like that.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_03
 Because can we have LCD and speech recognition with battery and...

0:17:44	SPEAKER_03
 It's also related to the size of the...

0:17:49	SPEAKER_02
 Just the point to the energy is things.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_02
 If we use the batteries and the additional solar cell, then it's okay for speech recognition and LCDs.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_02
 Oh no problem.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_02
 So, we have to use the solar cell.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_03
 Otherwise, no.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_03
 But using how many batteries, for example, maybe what is the size of the batteries?

0:18:18	SPEAKER_02
 I think we can just come in AA cells.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so like 1, 2, 5 centimeters, I don't know exactly, but...

0:18:27	SPEAKER_00
 So if we use solar cells, where is the sun?

0:18:31	SPEAKER_00
 If someone's watching TV inside.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't need to be, it's just the daylight.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_02
 I suppose that this remote control won't be in the room like this, where there is light only.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_03
 And there are people, but at least when there is TV, you can get light from the TV.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think it's the alarm.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_02
 It's a compromise, you know.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_03
 At least it's new when maybe technology.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's why I wanted to innovate.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_02
 Because of the speech recognition, because you want it all the different things.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_00
 But it's very useful.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_03
 I think before talking about the other thing, it's the case.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_03
 What are going to be the size?

0:19:25	SPEAKER_03
 Because it's with drives, there's what we are going to use as features and so on.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_03
 For example, for the LCD, if we choose to have a small device, we cannot use this.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_02
 The screen is okay, but the board is a problem.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_02
 What would you guess as a shape?

0:19:49	SPEAKER_01
 I think the bank large or small is not important.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 The only important thing is to be able to take it in the sidehand easily.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_01
 So let's say an average size, and it should not be very heavy also.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_01
 And I prefer to, it shouldn't have a uniform shape.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_01
 So in the middle, it should be a little bit thinner, maybe, maybe.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_01
 So it's like some joysticks.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_01
 You can take some joysticks.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_01
 You can take insidehand easier, because it's designed for your taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_01
 The general shape should be like this. I think 7 cm by 7 cm is a little bit large.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_01
 So not 7, but let's say 5 by 10.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's my opinion.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_01
 Which is the same area.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_00
 Could you redesign your board?

0:20:57	SPEAKER_00
 5 to 10.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_00
 Which is 10 cm by 10 cm?

0:21:02	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's fissure.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_02
 Well, one...

0:21:08	SPEAKER_02
 How could we do it?

0:21:10	SPEAKER_02
 We could put the board under the LCD, and for example make the LCD be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_02
 Like holding something and the LCD to be just on top of it.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_02
 But maybe let's stick to the spongy thing, like one unit.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_02
 5 to 10, it would be fissure.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_03
 That is just thing could be two.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_03
 Two after smaller LCD, if it's possible.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so 5 to 10, I think it's feasible.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_03
 So we are doing it with a smaller LCD.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know, but I don't want to now invent something new, because we didn't discuss about it.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_01
 So using some LCDs we can touch so we can remove keys and just having...

0:22:00	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know the name.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_01
 LCD is supposed to be a finger touching screen.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_01
 Touch screen.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_01
 But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screen, I think using a smaller screen is better.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_03
 Because the problem is we have a limited amount of time, so we cannot do something very new.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_03
 So that's both a small LCD.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, so just give me the 5 by 10 numbers that you find the best and send it to me at my live by 10.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_03
 So what about the case we talked about?

0:22:53	SPEAKER_03
 Is it to use?

0:22:55	SPEAKER_03
 You said something is it to use, but how does that fit in a fashion way?

0:22:59	SPEAKER_03
 Like with fruit and vegetable?

0:23:02	SPEAKER_03
 What's the color and logo of the company?

0:23:07	SPEAKER_03
 And so now can we do that?

0:23:12	SPEAKER_03
 My first idea is because our color is more yellow and it should be easy to take in a hand.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_03
 I thought about banana or something like that, which is fruit.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_02
 I'm 7 to 10 banana.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's definitely the obvious choice with the color of your company.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_00
 But just an idea, I don't know what you think about it.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if you can fit with the technology you have with the specialists.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_02
 I think banana.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_02
 If the banana is big enough, then yes.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_02
 So if you want to look at the screen and banana, you know.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_03
 I think the screen has to be square or it can be like a shape quite.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_02
 It can be whatever you want.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_02
 But if it's square, then we get four screens out of one by cutting just.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_02
 But if you want some shape, then we can only get like two screens out of 7 to 7 inches.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_02
 It's like more expensive to have a shape like that, but I don't care.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's a big requirement.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_00
 I'd like a shaped screen.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on the TFT screen.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe the banana could be a bit fatter than the cut common one.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you should remember banana, but it doesn't have to be a banana.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_03
 It's a size and exactly the shape of banana.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_02
 So well, we stick to banana.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, banana is good.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_03
 So, the last point we decided it's in 4 red.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, that's the right answer.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_03
 So that's it. I think about the concept. You have other thing to add to this point.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_03
 But the user interface, we are going to use LCD.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_03
 In the last meeting, we talked about hidden buttons.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what we're going to do with that.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_03
 You talked about the feeling of buttons on the side.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_02
 It would be cool.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_02
 Feeling of the banana, you know, you should discover the other buttons.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_03
 And you mean the first layer would be spongy?

0:26:13	SPEAKER_02
 Obviously.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_02
 So it's like silly, but the people will appreciate it.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_03
 Is it possible to do that?

0:26:21	SPEAKER_03
 It would be a great idea, but possible technique.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_03
 Like doing spongy layer.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_00
 If we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana, it's easy to manipulate that.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_00
 It would be a cover that you can pull off.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_01
 Something like a plastic cover covering some interface, USB interfaces in digital camera.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_01
 You see, it's like pulling you open a plastic cover and you see some USB interfaces, some interfaces for adaptors.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_01
 So, buttons can be covered like this with a plastic cover.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_01
 And when you open this cover, it's like pulling a banana.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_01
 So something like this.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_03
 But do you see that as a rigid thing?

0:27:17	SPEAKER_03
 Like a banana, something very soft.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_02
 Is it possible to make it soft?

0:27:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's like a plastic cover.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_01
 So I think it's so that it's cool.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what you think, Bob, but it would be great for users, I think.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_00
 I think for sure, definitely the softer the better.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_00
 Cool.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_02
 I was just speaking, I cannot imagine it so far, but it will be terrible.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's sitting in buttons.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_03
 He doesn't know.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_03
 Is there any other remarks or something we didn't talk about?

0:28:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, yes.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_03
 I think we're almost there.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe, if we have a soft thing like this, and to open it, we have to attach it somewhere.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know how to do that, technically.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_00
 Could you spell card?

0:28:52	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe magnetic.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_01
 It's a good idea.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_03
 Magnetic.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it can be a plastic cover sticking to all this stuff.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_01
 Magnetic materials in the border, so it sticks like refrigerator door completely.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_01
 When you try to open it, it will be opened easily.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_01
 You can be sure that it will not be opened while you are commonly using buttons under the banner.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_03
 And what would be the material of the first layer?

0:29:53	SPEAKER_03
 Soft plastic?

0:29:57	SPEAKER_00
 I imagine some sort of vinyl.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_00
 With a swayed feel.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_02
 Since the things like the screen and solar cell has to be kept in shape.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_02
 We need that to be linked.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_02
 We should take care of these two things.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_02
 If the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed, then the material must be able to put light inside.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_02
 So that we can raise the energy out of it.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_00
 So you're saying it's possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_02
 Let's do it.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_02
 If it's better to put the solar cell to the peeling.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_02
 Or inside, but then it must be some window.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_03
 And something we forgot maybe about the speech recognition system.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's important.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_00
 It seems feasible and it's something for technology.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_03
 So we have the design, the good shape, new and so on.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_03
 And we have also the technology thing.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_03
 Even the easy to use things.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_03
 So we also have speech recognition.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_03
 So that's great.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_03
 We have decided everything and think well on a good way.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_03
 The next meeting we start in 30 minutes.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_03
 So the industrial manager will work on the look and fill design.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_03
 The user interface manager will work on the user interface device.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_03
 And the marketing expert will do the first product evaluation.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_03
 So I hope you can do that in 30 minutes.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_03
 I think you should work together with your Hamad and Peter to work in a first prototype.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_03
 And more about the shape and so on.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_03
 And as usual, you will receive some specific instructions.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you everybody and see you in 30 minutes.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:33:54	None
 Thank you.
