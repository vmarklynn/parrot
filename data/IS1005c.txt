 Hello, this meeting should be focused on conceptual design of the remote control.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_03
 The goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about a lot and we had a rough idea of what it is going to be but at the end of this meeting we have to reach a decision.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_03
 So we will have again three presentations from all of you and I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to follow long description and decisions.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_03
 So who wants to start?

0:01:33	SPEAKER_01
 I think.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_01
 No, no.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_00
 You get a start.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, how's that?

0:01:39	SPEAKER_00
 Can you open my presentation please?

0:01:46	SPEAKER_00
 I'm number four.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_03
 Train this one?

0:01:57	None
 Yep.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_00
 Can you pass the mouse please?

0:02:03	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so I'm basically just want to present to you some recent results we've had from looking at some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_00
 Fashion trends we got from talking to our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_00
 So from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel as opposed to a functional look and feel is our number one priority.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_00
 Fancy is the highest priority.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_00
 Secondly that our remote control needs to be technologically innovative.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_00
 So this is number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_00
 And thirdly the easiness of use is important as well but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_00
 From our fashion people in Paris and Milan we've discovered that this year the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in clothes, shoes and furniture.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_00
 And also the feel of material this year is expected to be spongy.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_00
 So hopefully our remote control reflects that in some way.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_00
 What does it mean spongy?

0:03:57	SPEAKER_00
 Sort of squishy.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_00
 Like soft or something.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah soft like a sponge.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_00
 So in conclusion our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_00
 Has lots of technology in it.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_00
 Somehow it would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with the spongy feel.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_00
 And that's easy to use.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_00
 And from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of the real reaction company.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_03
 That's it.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_03
 Easy to use is it as much importance and technology offensive and it's less important

0:04:47	SPEAKER_00
 right? Less important.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_00
 Fancyness first and then two to you know half as important as that is technology.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_00
 And half important as technology is easy to use.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_03
 So Ahmed can you?

0:05:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_02
 I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_03
 One number three.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_03
 This one?

0:05:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_01
 Just could you please check if it is the first one or the second?

0:05:35	SPEAKER_01
 No no no it's the first one.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_01
 The second one.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_03
 And this one.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_01
 I think I think the future is easy to use is more important than being fancy but okay we can discuss about it later.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_01
 Generally this remote control should be something in my opinion.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_01
 The first feature is just to be easy to use.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_01
 So the more frequent buttons should be larger.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_01
 They should be placed in a good position inside the remote control.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_01
 And I can conclude like this that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_01
 It should be we shouldn't need to open a book and start reading and learning how to use this remote control.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_01
 Okay so what I found out that as I said I think it's better to put more frequent buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control and they should be bigger in size.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_01
 The shape of remote control should be in a way which should be taken easily in hand.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_01
 It should not be completed like a cube.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_01
 It should have round edge so then it's easier and maybe just like some toys some duosick which is easier to take inside the hand.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_01
 And also because customer doesn't like to buy lots of battery it should not consume lots of energy.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay and my personal preference is as I said just putting these buttons in special places and cover some buttons which are not used that much like settings buttons like mobile phone usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_01
 So we can cover these buttons which are not used or number buttons for the channels and just put volume change or channel change buttons in the remote control and if the user needed to do some more complex tasks he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_01
 And also I think if we put some buttons in size of the remote control it can be used easier not on remote control.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if I can explain well but just in size for example sliding or rolling stuff if we put it in size then we can easily manipulate it with thumb.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_01
 So it can be another preference.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_01
 And I don't know but I think usually just speech recognizer can be good.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_01
 I know that it consumes lots of energy but if we do it in some way that it sleeps when there is no sun and when it detects some sun it may consume less energy.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_01
 And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new so it may not be very useful but because it's new people may buy it.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_01
 I personally think there should be a big difference between something otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_01
 That's fine.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, good news for me from Hamet but then here's the remote obviously because it's pointy design and I don't like it as an engine but okay so could you please go down and open it?

0:10:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_02
 First and two and which one probably the first one I'm not sure but check the first one.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_02
 Most of the things I have to write myself on this board but yeah that's it.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_02
 It's only this slide.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_02
 This is just one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just found this that our company developed seven fingers or yeah seven inch TFT screen which is good news for us since we wanted to include the display there.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_02
 So I probably draw it down overall scheme.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_02
 This is the stuff that I can use.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_02
 So this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_02
 First thing is this will be the overall shape.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_02
 Now I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device but the shape of the inside of the device.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_02
 So there will be some circuit for the power.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_02
 So say power circuit here.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_02
 The main energy will be taken from batteries that we can and if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there we must use additional source of energy which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can supply everything.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_02
 I was computing all the things related to the speech recognition and it's okay to use just two batteries and solar cells.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_02
 So no problem.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_02
 There can be also solar cell.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_02
 The main board with all the circuits will take at least 7 to 7 centimeters so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_02
 So at least 77.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_02
 It depends where you put your screen because the screen is 7 inch so it depends when you where you put it doesn't matter.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's just one cord from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_02
 So this will be TFT.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_02
 And on the main board we have the interface to the microphone which is somewhere.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_02
 Say here.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_02
 Interface to the microphone then the graphical card for the TFT and the third unit is the IR.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_02
 The good news is that we can we decided to use the infrared unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infrared including all the stuff inside so it will be very cheap for us.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_02
 So infrared here.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_02
 So once again the overall requirement 7 to 7 centimeters for the board which can be this pointy but has to be this size and the TFT which is 7 inches.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_02
 I have to check what I wanted to.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_02
 From my point of view I don't care about the material used for the overall device.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_03
 Do you fit any TFT or any electronic device in a sponge thing or is there any problem for that?

0:14:17	SPEAKER_03
 For example, put the electronic card on a sponge thing.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_03
 I can imagine it could be a problem.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_02
 All these things in this box are okay to put in any shape basically.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_02
 But we have to take care of the TFT.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_02
 Wow.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_02
 It's a good feature since it takes if it's around the TFT.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_02
 And it's good because it just keeps it safe.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can have two shells, a hard shell inside and a sponge.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe put electronic in a box and a sponge thing around.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_03
 Where is that?

0:14:55	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it's maybe related to the UI.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_02
 Can I ask a question?

0:14:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's all for me.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_00
 This 7 inch TFT screen.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_00
 How big is it in reality?

0:15:05	SPEAKER_02
 Well, 7 to 7 inches.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_00
 Sort of like that.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_00
 That's quite big.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_00
 We decided that we're going to use this TFT screen.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think it's 7 by 7.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's 7 by 7.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_03
 Usually when they say 7 inches.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, even that is still likely to speak.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_03
 One each one.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I should think.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_02
 Honestly speaking, I was thinking that it was 7 centimeters initially.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_02
 It's 7 inches.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_02
 And I think we can cut it.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_00
 You can cut the TFT screen.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_00
 No problem.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_02
 Because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_00
 So, you have no problem to meet your card screen.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_02
 So for the same price, we have four screens.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_03
 Technica engineers.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_00
 So what's the size of the device?

0:16:03	SPEAKER_02
 Well, this is almost nothing.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_02
 7 to 7, 2 at least, well some 3 millimeters or something.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_00
 Even from my perspective, 7 centimeters by 7 centimeters is still.

0:16:14	None
 Yeah.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_02
 But we wanted to be spot- Can you hold that?

0:16:18	SPEAKER_02
 Stuff like that, you know.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_02
 Because if it's too small, we can lose it at home, you know.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_03
 What user wants?

0:16:26	SPEAKER_03
 They want a small remote control.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_00
 It's a good control.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_00
 They can hold it in the hands of something.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_00
 But it's something that 7 centimeters square.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_00
 Easy to hold.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I think so.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_02
 If the roller buttons are on the side, you don't have to catch it like that.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_02
 But just like this and, you know, follow, follow.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that's, does not task for me.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_03
 But, well, so maybe you can finish your presentation and after we discuss these experiences.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_02
 Thanks.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_02
 That's it.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_03
 So, so I think we have a lot.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_03
 We have to take decision today.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we have to take some work to finalize our idea and take decisions.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_03
 First, I think energy is a key problem because it depends what can we have as feature if we use only batteries, for example, or something like that.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_03
 Because can we have LCD and speech recognition with battery and it's also related to the size of the, oh, still.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_02
 Just a point to do energy things.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_02
 If we use the batteries and the additional solar cell, then it's okay for speech recognition and LCD.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_02
 So no problem in energy.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_02
 So, thing.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_02
 But we have to use the solar cell.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_03
 Otherwise not.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_03
 Like, but using how many batteries, for example, or what?

0:18:15	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe what is the size of the batteries?

0:18:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_02
 So, just common A-A cells.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_02
 So like one or two, five centimeters.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know exactly what.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_00
 So if we use solar cells, where is the sun?

0:18:31	SPEAKER_00
 If someone's watching TV inside.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, there's a need to be.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_02
 It's just the daylight, you know.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_02
 To come on eyes.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_02
 I suppose that this remote control won't be in the room like this, whereas there is light only.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_03
 And there are people, but at least when there is TV, you can get light from the TV.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think so.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:18:55	None
 Okay.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it's a compromise, you know.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_03
 At least it's new and maybe technology.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the toy I want to introduce.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 You can put the speech recognition because you want it all in the same.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_00
 And if you watch TV outside, it's very useful.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_03
 I think before talking about the other thing, it's important thing.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_03
 It's the case.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_03
 What are going to be the size?

0:19:24	SPEAKER_03
 Because it's with drives, what we are going to use as features and so on.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_03
 For example, for the LCD.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_03
 If we choose to have a small device, we cannot use this as such.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, the screen is okay about the board.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_02
 That's a problem.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_02
 Well, what would you guess as a shape or what would be the shape?

0:19:49	SPEAKER_01
 I think the bank, large or small is not important.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 The only important thing is to be able to take it inside hand easily.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_01
 So let's say an average size, okay, and it should not be very heavy also.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_01
 And I prefer to, it shouldn't have a uniform shape.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_01
 So in the middle, it should be a little bit thinner maybe.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 So it's like some joysticks.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_01
 You can take, some joysticks, you can take inside hand easier because it's designed for your taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_01
 So the general shape should be like this.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_01
 I think 7 cm by 7 cm is a little bit large.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_01
 So 7, not 7, but let's say 5 by 10.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's just my opinion.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_01
 Which is the same area.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_00
 Could you redesign your board?

0:20:56	SPEAKER_02
 5 to 10.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, 5 centimeters by 10 centimeters.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, right.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think it's feasible.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_02
 Well, one, how could we do it?

0:21:10	SPEAKER_02
 We could put the board next to, well, under the LCD.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_02
 And for example, make the LCD be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand, like holding something and the LCD should be just on top of it, you know, somehow.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_02
 But maybe let's stick to the spongy thing, like one unit.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_02
 5 to 10.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_03
 So I think it's just thing could be to have a smaller LCD if it's possible.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so 5 to 10, I think it's feasible.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_03
 So we have to be with a smaller.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_01
 Or a 3 to 5 by 10.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_01
 All right, I don't know, but I don't want to now invent something new because we didn't discuss about it.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_01
 So using some LCDs, we can touch, so we can remove keys and just having, I don't know, the name.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_01
 I'll see the response into fingers touching the screen.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_01
 Some touch.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_01
 Some touch.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_01
 So, but for now, if we don't want to use such kind of screen, I think we're using a

0:22:16	SPEAKER_03
 smaller screen is better because the problem is we have a limited amount of time, so we cannot do something very new.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_03
 So that's both for small LCD.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so just give me the 5 by 10 numbers that you find the best and send me.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_01
 So 5 by 10.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_03
 So what about, so the case we talked about?

0:22:53	SPEAKER_03
 Something easy to use.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_03
 But how does that fit in a fashion way like with fruit and vegetable and about the color and logo of the company and so on.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_03
 Now, can we do that?

0:23:12	SPEAKER_03
 My first idea is because our color is more yellow and it should be easy to take in your hand, I thought about banana or something like that, which is fruit and 7 to 10 banana.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_02
 A big banana.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_02
 More yellow.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_02
 Rather mango or something.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it's definitely obvious choice with the color of our company.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, what are the other fruit vegetables?

0:23:38	SPEAKER_00
 Just an idea.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know what you feel about.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_00
 Do you know any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow?

0:23:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if you can fit with the technology you want to specialist.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if you want to put that in banana.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_02
 Well, but if it's, if the banana is big enough, then yes.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_02
 So if you want to look at the screen at banana, you know.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_03
 I think this is the screen that has to be square or it can be like a shape quite.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it can be whatever you want.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_02
 But if it's square, then we get four screens out of one by cutting just.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_02
 But if you want some shape, then we can only get like two screens out of 7 to 7 inches.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_02
 So it's like more, more expensive to have shaped like that.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_02
 But I don't care.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_02
 You know, if we, if we, if we're quite a man.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_00
 I'd like a shaped screen.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on, on the TFT screen.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe the banana could be like a bit fatter than the car, the car coming in one.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you should remember banana, but it doesn't have to be like banana.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_03
 Like more than banana, okay.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_03
 Where is the size and exactly the shape of banana.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, banana is good.

0:25:11	None
 Okay.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_03
 So, this is the last point we decided it's in far-right.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, I think about the concept.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_03
 You have also thing to add to this point.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_03
 So, about the user interface.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_03
 So we are going to use NCD.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_03
 In the last meeting we talked about hidden buttons.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what we're going to do with that.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_03
 You talked about healing buttons on the side.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, that's banana.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_02
 It would be cool.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_02
 Feeling of the banana, you know.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_02
 Discover the other buttons.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_03
 And you mean the first layer would be spongy.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_02
 First layer, open the spoon.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_02
 So, it's like silly, but the people will appreciate it.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_03
 Is it possible to do that?

0:26:20	SPEAKER_03
 It would be a great idea, but possible technical.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_03
 Like doing a spongy layer of the banana.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_00
 If we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana, then it's easy to manipulate that to be a cover that you can pull off.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_01
 Something like plastic cover covering some interface, USB interfaces in digital cameras.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_01
 You see it's like pulling you open a plastic cover and you see some USB interfaces, some interfaces for adapter.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_01
 So, buttons can be covered like this with a plastic cover.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_01
 And when you open this cover, it's like pulling a banana.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_01
 So, something like this.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but do you see that as rigid thing or like a banana?

0:27:18	SPEAKER_03
 Something very soft. You can open a banana.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_02
 Is it possible to make it soft?

0:27:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_01
 It's like a plastic cover.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_01
 So, I think it's so.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what you think, Bob, but it would be great for users, I think.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_03
 I think for sure.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_00
 Definitely the softer the better.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_00
 Cool.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, it's the speaker.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_02
 I cannot imagine it so far, but it will be terrible.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_03
 Sitting buttons hidden in a...

0:27:57	SPEAKER_03
 Over remarks.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_03
 Something we didn't talk about, yes.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_03
 I think we're almost there.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe how can we, if we have a soft thing like this, and to open it we have to attach it somewhere.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know how to do that.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_00
 I could use Velcro.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, maybe magnetic.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, it's a good idea.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_01
 Magnetic.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_03
 Magnetic?

0:28:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it can be a plastic cover sticking to the oldest stuff, like magnetic materials in the border.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_01
 So, it sticks like a refrigerator door completely.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_01
 And when you try to open it, it will be opened easily.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_01
 So, you can be sure that it will not be opened while you're commonly using buttons under the manner.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_03
 It could be the material of the first layer, I mean, like soft plastic.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I imagine some sort of vinyl thing, in a sort of a... with a suede sort of feel.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_02
 Well, since the things like the screen and the solar cell has to be kept in shape, we cannot.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_02
 So, we need that appealing.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_02
 So, if the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed, then the material must be able to put the light inside, you know, so that we can reach the energy out of it.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_00
 So, your sign is possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_02
 It is possible, but...

0:31:02	SPEAKER_02
 And a banana.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know how to do it, if it's better to put the solar cell to the peeling, or inside, but then it must be some window.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_03
 And something we forgot maybe about the speech recognition system, now we're going to use it.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's important, I think, one of our...

0:31:34	SPEAKER_00
 It's very big, something very bright.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_03
 So, we have the designs, a good shape, new and so on, and we have also the technology thing, it won't be.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_03
 And even the easy to use thing, so it will be perfect.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_03
 So, we had also the speech recognition device.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_03
 So, that's great, we have decided everything and I think, wow, in a good way.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_03
 So, the next meeting we start in 30 minutes.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_03
 So, the industry and manager will work on the look and feel design.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_03
 The user interface manager will work on the user interface device and the marketing expert will do the first product evaluation.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_03
 So, I hope you can do that in 30 minutes.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_03
 And, yeah, I think you should work together, you have made a picture to work in the first prototype, and more about the shape and so on, and how you can manage to put everything together.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_03
 And, as usual, you will receive some specific instructions and so on.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you everybody and see you in 30 minutes.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, thank you.

0:33:53	None
 Thank you.
