0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, well I think we're ready to begin.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_02
 Right, my name's Adam Jugger, we're here because of real reaction.

0:00:10	SPEAKER_02
 We have in the group.

0:00:13	SPEAKER_01
 Ebenezer, I didn't say.

0:00:15	SPEAKER_01
 He's like a T-sporter.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, go for it mate.

0:00:20	SPEAKER_02
 And he said.

0:00:22	SPEAKER_02
 And he said.

0:00:23	SPEAKER_01
 E-R.

0:00:24	SPEAKER_01
 Ebenezer, your role is.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_01
 I'm the marketing expert.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_02
 You're the marketing expert.

0:00:29	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_04
 Next we have.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_04
 Tyre Grammer, C-A-R-I-K, and your role in this is.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_02
 Industrial designer, industrial designer.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_02
 And lastly we have Dave Cochran.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_02
 And you're going to be the user interface designer.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_02
 Right, this is the agenda for today's meeting.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_02
 As you can see, opening, acquaintance, tool training, project plan, discussion, and closing.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_02
 We already got through opening and partially through acquaintance.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_02
 So the reason we're here, we're going to design a new remote control, as you probably all know.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_02
 The very broad overview is original, trendy, and user friendly.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_02
 Of course we'll have to go into a bit more detail of that.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_02
 But personally I think that the original is going to be a very key aspect of this design.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_02
 There's a lot of remote controls out there anyway, so we're going to need something that's really going to set it apart.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_02
 This is how today seems to be going to work.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_02
 Now the 3K faces, as you've probably already been told, the functional, etc. and the detailed design.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_02
 The first one's going to be covering the user requirements back, technical functions, working design.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_02
 The second seems to be conceptual components properties, materials.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_02
 And the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_02
 Of course you've all got the similar emails, I believe.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_02
 What can I say?

0:02:19	SPEAKER_02
 Every user?

0:02:20	SPEAKER_02
 Do you want to draw your favourite animal?

0:02:23	SPEAKER_02
 Sure.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_00
 White bush.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to make this quick since we don't have much time.

0:02:43	None
 Okay.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so it's not the best picture in the world.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_01
 Here we have an elephant. First point begins with an E, same like Ebenezer.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_01
 Also elephants have a very good memory, much like myself.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_01
 And I can't remember back when I used to live in Nigeria, but I think I used to have a pet elephant.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_01
 So elephants are big, strong and gentle, and they have great memories, and they begin with a letter E, just like Ebenezer.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_02
 Brilliantly done. Thank you.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_02
 Eric, would you like to have a shot at...

0:04:10	SPEAKER_02
...a bit of artistry?

0:04:13	SPEAKER_04
 Let's go all the way.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, I can clip them to your belt.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I think you should also have your little bell mic on as well.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_01
 David.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that's good. We can clip them on.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, there's this microphone as well, that's you.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_04
 What, how did I put that?

0:04:34	SPEAKER_01
 Just somewhere...

0:04:44	SPEAKER_02
 The other... it's just a corset, I said.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yep.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_03
 Is this what we clipped?

0:05:00	SPEAKER_02
 I think so.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it'll follow you if you...

0:05:03	SPEAKER_02
 It's really good.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_02
 You can probably stick it in your pocket for now, I wouldn't worry too much.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_02
 Which would have been great.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, destroying your outfit.

0:06:15	None
 It's a good point.

0:06:19	None
 Maybe.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_04
 All right, here we have a tiger.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_04
 I always love tigers.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_04
 They're big, they're big as cats.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_04
 They're a project on cats at the wild ones, a kid.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_04
 And it was my favourite cat just because it looks the best.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_04
 It stripes orange.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_04
 My dad used to talk about... he's from Bangladesh, so he used to tell me how they'd done money as a kid.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_04
 And they're just the most feared of animals in the wild.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_04
 So that's why I like them.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_04
 Don't say them, end them at me really, but...

0:07:07	SPEAKER_02
 Excellent, thank you very much.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_02
 Steve, you'd like to have a dash?

0:07:39	None
 Thank you.

0:08:09	None
 Thank you.

0:08:34	None
 Thank you.

0:09:04	None
 Thank you.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_03
 Monkey.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_03
 I have a three-year-old daughter who is affectionately known as Miss Monkey.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_03
 Monkeys have attitude, which I think is a good thing.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_03
 And from the point of view, there's a study of human evolution.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_03
 And I love rhyme, it's terribly interesting.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_03
 This one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most.

0:10:23	None
 Thank you.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_02
 Hardly what I'd call the best drawing in the world, but it'll do for now.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_02
 Also not quite as feared as your average tiger, but cats are one of my favourite animals.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_02
 They're very independent, they're snotty as hell at the best of times.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_02
 And what can you say? You've got all of those qualities in an animal.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_02
 I think we've all managed to master every whiteboard there by looks of it.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_02
 So, on to it, project finance.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_02
 As you can see, 12.5 euros per unit.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_02
 It's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_02
 And we're hoping to sell them for 25.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_02
 If we're aiming for 50 million euros, we're going to have to be selling an awful lot.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_01
 That was property, that was a amount, so that's the amount made.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, for 50 million, and if you're making 12.5 euros in each one, then awful lot need to be sold.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, now we better actually just get on with the meat of the project.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_02
 So, I'm going to guess that we've all used remote controls.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_02
 Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market?

0:12:16	SPEAKER_03
 Well, one thing I'm aware of is that there are very high price end of the market.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_03
 There's an emerging market for touch screen LCD remotes that can be programmed in much more sophisticated ways.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_03
 You can re-design the interface to your own needs.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_03
 You can program in macros, and you get a much greater degree.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_03
 You can get three and one five milliliters, but you can get integration between the different things that are designed to control, and you can have a much greater extent.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_03
 You can have one macro to turn the TV to the right channel, get the re-rewind the tape and the VCR and get it to play what's its rewind, for instance.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_03
 It occurs to me there might be a niche for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality, but using a conventional push button design, and therefore putting it into a much lower price bracket.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, yeah, that's true.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_02
 With the price range we're looking at, going for a touch screen would probably be possible.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but you think, again, something to control multiple units in a simple fashion.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I mean, I see, I mean, you get ones that you can switch between multiple units, but something that could operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_03
 So, an ideally something into which would have some at least limited facility for running macros.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_02
 Would you be idea something along the lines of one on button would turn on, say, the video recorded the TV, maybe the sound system as well, all in one go?

0:14:13	SPEAKER_03
 For instance, I say, or, you press, say, the play button for the DVD player and it turns the TV on and on to the right channel as well.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, that sounds like a good strong idea.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_02
 Any takesness?

0:14:39	SPEAKER_01
 I've noticed that gaming is becoming quite popular with television.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_01
 When I was younger, we used to play games using a cable, using the cable, subscriber cable providers.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_01
 But our remote controls get worn out really easily, and the remote controls not a great kind of keypad for playing games.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_01
 So perhaps one that was more specialized for game playing or interactive television.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_01
 They recently brought out this new remote control for people to set their favorite channels to record things.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_01
 Instead of people entering in what time things start, you simply start a slide of bar to save what time it begins and slide a level bar to save what time it ends.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_01
 You know, that's...

0:15:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I've heard I've seen the barcode design before, yeah.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_01
 It's taken out the... you don't have to be really clever to use the remote control.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_01
 I think the gaming, you know, you want some big buttons for up, down, left and right, shoot.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_01
 You want to be able to change angles and then to write to television, so you need buttons to change the camera angles and stuff like that.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, well, we're beginning to run out of time now, so we've got a couple of ideas.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_02
 We'll have to work fast.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_02
 As you can see, we've got 30 minutes until the next meeting, so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality how the user interface might work.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_02
 That'll be a key aspect, especially if the idea of some kind of macro facility because you have to program it.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_02
 You have a lot of response back, or at least some kind.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_02
 And we're going to maybe try and have to figure out what the user wants.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_02
 What the user wants, yes.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_02
 Right, has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage, anything they think that might have been missed so far?

0:16:42	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know, but I think we're going to have to have a lot of time to talk about gaming, so I think they should have some sort of stick on it rather than other things.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_02
 I don't see why not almost everybody's probably used to a console by now, and all of them incorporate small dpads on them. In fact, even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well, so it's probably an interface that most people are used to.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_02
 And that could allow easy navigation, users of joystick as well.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_03
 Can you feature that would be a good idea of building a building? It's to make something fairly ergonomic, something that fits as comfortably as possible into the hand.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_03
 It's a bit more of a slightly unconventional, attractive shape for it overall.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_02
 And something that's just a little bit different, slightly sort of biomorphic and far.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we finish this one up, we'll get started, I'll write up what we've kind of quickly done, and I'll get it out to everybody.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_02
 I'm far as I'm aware we leave the microphones here, unless we're told otherwise, and just take the laptop for us.
