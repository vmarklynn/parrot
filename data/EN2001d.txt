0:00:00	None
 g Okay.

0:00:37	None
 Okay.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_08
 Okay.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_05
 I tell you that we've got kind of two way interaction, maybe controlled play for an after-ins, so play where it should be.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_01
 Now, it's just like sort of like preparing people for, it looks like, it looks like really nothing.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_01
 It looks like basically less than their stuff, but actually Dave has written a whole underlying different structure now, and if we hook it up with my display, then we should fairly easily from now get to a stage where we can select individual segments and click on them and then play that part in a compressed way and display density information.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_01
 Now, at the moment, the application is, which you probably said, sorry, this is a good question.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, sure.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_01
 So at the moment, we have a dialogue act window and the graphically displayed, I'm not sure.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_01
 The interesting thing is the sound came when I tried it last time after I triggered off something by clicking on something.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, there suddenly they come, probably they're just slow and loading, and they don't have the buttons yet.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_01
 So at the moment, the display is still discoupled from it.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_01
 It's loading your data.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not quite sure.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_01
 It probably looks like where a state from the looks of it.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_01
 But the segments are made up at the moment, but the code's there for integrating real segments, and this is summarized based on just where a state at the moment from some part of the meeting.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_01
 So we're not loading the whole thing at the moment yet properly.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_01
 But the important thing is this is summarized based on, I really wasn't always pointing at my screen, you don't see.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_01
 So this stuff is summarized based on these intensity measures.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_01
 And we don't have the exact audio record for this, we should have just copied it.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_01
 So we have to show Dave has put a music file in there, and the music file is playing without gaps.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_01
 That's because the way how we handle it at the moment is that Dave prepares an audio file, creates an audio file dynamically from just the chunks that you want to have, and that runs in sync with what we have in there.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure why I'm making it loud, it's just...

0:03:04	SPEAKER_00
 We see that running along with the playing of the music, we see the highlighted dialogue acts.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_05
 That's pretty good.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_05
 Ego's a control play from the dialogue acts, and it will play that section of the file as well.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_01
 So, and that already, this part he already is dynamically created.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_01
 Let's just load it with the adjustments that it just to see a difference.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_05
 What that one looks like, just need to...

0:03:45	SPEAKER_04
 So a rich version of my data was of the very first one.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_01
 We were like doing this, we were just concerned with the whole...

0:03:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I mean, it doesn't matter.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_01
 Where am I looking for my local friend data manager, where am I looking?

0:04:01	SPEAKER_05
 Is it with the file name, sorry, is it here?

0:04:05	SPEAKER_01
 Is it here where it's important file?

0:04:09	SPEAKER_05
 No, it's on your display, where it calls, which one to get, you just need to change the flag.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_05
 In my display, I think it must be a mess I pass here.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_04
 How do you do this somewhere?

0:04:25	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, you can change it in the summary, where the summary is called in program over here.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_04
 So are you basing it on certain thresholds, or a special?

0:04:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, just hits the top line.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_05
 So where did you say the program is?

0:04:42	SPEAKER_05
 The easiest thing is in program manager, where it makes the summary the best procedure.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_01
 You know where that is, just about?

0:04:48	SPEAKER_05
 It'll be above that.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_01
 Above that.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_05
 In this main, in this routine.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_01
 There's something great importance with the zero, and there's a word importance with the one.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_05
 Let's swap those around.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe it'll be in the summary constructor.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_01
 What's the difference?

0:05:22	SPEAKER_05
 This is read them into separate arrays, and then you can change the flag to select them, which one is this.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_01
 So let's just swap the find them to run for now.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that's a crash.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, yeah, and we really leave a song, maybe we'll be able to make a new constructor that lets you set the flag.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_01
 So you have time this afternoon.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_01
 So this shows, if we see anything at all, then we see at the moment at least that we're definitely having a different summary, just because we're having a different important measure.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_01
 So you see that it does something like at the moment, I think this was the old version.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_01
 So it shows, if you think about how the old version happened, then you see it makes sense that words like prosody, just like a thing, if that was the only utterance, that probably scored quite well in stuff.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_01
 I have to get this button state.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_05
 It's weird, online.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_04
 Probably all these hoos and ahems are spelled differently in the thing, no, what's the problem?

0:06:47	SPEAKER_04
 You should generalize.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_01
 Unfortunately, I didn't get the bar on the display working just yet, but that should be a small one.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_04
 That's a very old one, rather.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_04
 I think those SS and E's and so on, the single letters are because of the problem with my...

0:07:07	SPEAKER_01
 This is very old, we should never call the charted stuff because we were working on.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_01
 So we see that we have a very different density curve as well for this one.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_01
 And, yes, so from here we go, and it hopefully won't be too difficult to now, first of all, put the right segments in, put a sliding bar into this so that people see where they are.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm constantly touching stuff on my screen, I realize.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_01
 And then make selections based on a segment.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_01
 Now, what we're not quite sure is what's the best way for how the summarizer works.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_01
 Should it always compress a segment to a constant length or by a constant factor of time?

0:07:47	SPEAKER_01
 What would you think, if there's a certain degree of summarization, what should be the constant?

0:07:58	SPEAKER_07
 I suppose it should depend on the length of the segment.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_01
 So always like a rela, so it should always reduce it to half.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_07
 It should make more sense.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_01
 An alternative view would be that...

0:08:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but perhaps more than half.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, well I guess that could be adapted.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_01
 An alternative view would be that you could sort of make it that it always is the same length.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_01
 So if the whole meeting is selected, it compresses the whole meeting to five minutes.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_01
 Then if one segment, one topic is selected and then it plays this whole topic in five minutes.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_01
 But that sort of gives people a bit less control over.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe we should do it instead.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_05
 You can expect that to be honest, if something we can worry about.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, and that's quite tricky to try and do, but a lot of other work today.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_01
 What's that to discuss for today, what's that to talk about for today?

0:08:53	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I was wanting to talk about the search.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, we need to get on that pretty shortly.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking to do most of that, like we can index search.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_05
 I need to do some changes to the program manager to be able to handle that.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I think basically what I need is just a list of words with an index to start with.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_07
 Each meeting, I'll find it in there.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_07
 It's supposed to be the amount as long as you're unique and I can pass them back to you and you can use that to do the hash.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, probably.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_01
 Should we abandon the whole notion of seeing the whole one whole group as one single thing and just work on a leaf?

0:09:40	SPEAKER_01
 Certainly for now and probably for good.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, you want to just go there for one meeting, are you needing more at the moment?

0:09:50	SPEAKER_05
 Well, from the point of ask developing it, it doesn't really make much difference.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_01
 Do we have everything for the same meeting at the moment?

0:10:00	SPEAKER_01
 Are you all working on the same meeting?

0:10:02	SPEAKER_07
 Yes, we'll use it in the first one.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_01
 Did anyone have a jacket that's actually a good meeting, or comparably to others?

0:10:12	SPEAKER_07
 I think it's segment quite well.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_08
 Okay.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_04
 So you want to send the prototype and we should change the data.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_04
 I'm sorry, the problem with the first meeting is that there's no hotspot annotation for that.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_04
 But I mean, that's not a really problem.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_04
 Do you take it from my directory or do I have to put it in the garage?

0:10:44	SPEAKER_05
 Why the moment? It's just an old file.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but would you take it from my directory or...?

0:10:52	SPEAKER_08
 Oh, yeah, that's the way you call it.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_05
 I don't think I'm going to be able to do the speech tools to try to make it into those because the documentation is really horrific.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_05
 It's really bad.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_05
 I think I'll just write out a script with the system called...

0:11:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, yeah, I just don't think it's worth wasting too much time on that.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_07
 It's not really important that we get it missing a clean array of points.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, especially because that's only done once every time the selection changes.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_01
 So even if we do an hourglass at that moment, even if it pauses for 10 seconds, well, that's tough like that.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should just make sure that if it takes quite some time, that the clock doesn't start before, whether the audio and the clock are in sync.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_05
 So we just start because of the summary.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, there's a wait for command for an external call to make sure that the external thing is finished because in general, like that sort of running parallel, I think.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_01
 I have some code for system calls like that handles the end of the output if you need some of that.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_05
 I think I'll need it.

0:12:26	None
 Okay.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_01
 I'll just dump out a 10 pre-five.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, cool.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_01
 I don't really know what to talk about.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_01
 We have...

0:12:43	SPEAKER_01
 See, there's one week after my dissertation, so we're before the presentation of the prototype, and we can work a lot, lot, lot on this, and that's good.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_05
 I think we should decide what we want it to actually look like in the end.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_05
 Are we going to have some kind of preview to represent the meetings?

0:13:06	SPEAKER_05
 It is, if we're not, and we'd probably have to make the graphically display a bit more information.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well, the graphic display will definitely have more information.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_01
 If we're at the moment abandoning the concept of displaying the whole series of meetings, just because it's for us more bureaucracy, more complexity, and it probably just won't give us any brownie points in the presentation.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_01
 But do you think it will? I mean, do you think...

0:13:40	SPEAKER_04
 I think it might work because Steve laid quite a lot of weight on surfing through meetings.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_04
 So we should at least provide an overview of different meetings of one group at the beginning here.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_04
 Talk a little bit about that.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_05
 It's not too difficult to do in a sort of a hack kind of way.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_05
 Where?

0:14:09	SPEAKER_01
 We can just treat it all as one meeting, yeah.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, and then maybe have some basic information.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_05
 Like if... we'll just create like a hard segment to start and then each meeting like once it arrives and sort of black or something like that.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so just a little bit of additional information in the display that knows we're meeting, picking it over and otherwise into it, we've treated.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_01
 So we have continuous IDs for the segments.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that works.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_05
 Other than...

0:14:38	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, other than...

0:14:39	SPEAKER_05
 We'll just create a hard boundary between each one and each one.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's better apart from that we don't really do anything different as we talk just for a meeting.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I completely agree. So the only thing that would be the display gets information about where they are and displays them as hard boundaries.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_04
 And what about the similarity measure for segments?

0:15:01	SPEAKER_04
 Do we also present that in this window and do we do it across meetings?

0:15:08	SPEAKER_04
 I think that was planned at the beginning wasn't it?

0:15:13	SPEAKER_01
 So initially I thought it was sort of more a search functionality that simply there's one button that says find similar segments.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_01
 And then in the same display where we display the search results from the search?

0:15:27	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so it wouldn't be displayed and...

0:15:31	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I'm not...

0:15:32	SPEAKER_01
 So you think displaying like an information about similarity to the selected meeting to select segment in the other segments?

0:15:41	SPEAKER_04
 No, I'm just coming back to our initial idea of presenting some of the similar segments across meetings and separating by some.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, I think that's... I really don't want to do that to be honest.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_01
 It would be nice but like...

0:15:58	SPEAKER_05
 It might be possible to do it in the summariser.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but it should appear as a continuous thing for the...

0:16:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it was that...

0:16:09	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if it's worth much bother though.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_01
 Like if we do a similarity search and just like you say find me similar segments and then sort of like you have a list and you click on one of them and then you go to that segment.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's quite useful even without displaying them sort of discontinuously.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_05
 So how will you display the search?

0:16:31	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I was thinking of just like really just more or less just imagine those search results each like each of them sort of giving whatever we should aim to get some names for segments like some extraction of something that we can call.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_01
 And if it's just the single highest importance measure of phrase of a segment so that we have something to display for them.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_01
 Like basically just a summarisation down to one segment and it would just be a list like this and you click on one and then...

0:17:00	SPEAKER_01
 You know then the whole bureaucracy kicks in like this gets the notification, this gets the notification.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, okay.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_01
 And then we could like we could sort of use the same thing for yours and mine because yours would sort of give just the segment IDs and mine would give the start segment IDs.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_01
 So basically this display would have information about a segment where something starts.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe also something where something ends like for mine and some string that we pass to describe what like what it is.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_01
 Wait, your search would return, would it return just the specific like it would go right to the utterance, right?

0:17:45	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, suppose my search would return the utterance but if your search is for a word you need an index for the word in the utterance.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah sure sure sure.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah so in your case like it would basically would probably say the utterance here or at least some part of it.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_01
 Probably so late.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, in my case it would say some name for the segment and then you would just click on it and then like the whole thing would kick in.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_01
 You click on it and the selection moves and the display goes to that part.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_05
 How advanced are we going to have our search?

0:18:22	SPEAKER_05
 Very restricted.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_05
 Very basic.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_05
 I think we should be able to restrict it to specific speakers.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, yeah.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_07
 If you can pass me like the dialogue act with, yeah, was it a speaker?

0:18:36	SPEAKER_07
 Do we have them with this speaker at the moment?

0:18:38	SPEAKER_05
 Well with the speaker ID.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, that should be enough in there.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, that's because if someone could create a file with the speaker IDs and speaker names.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I have that file.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I do that as well.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_05
 It's in the group.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_07
 Yes, in the data.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, in group data.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_07
 Speaker Dio or something.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, the data manager should be quite well documented.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_05
 So you should be able to use that.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_05
 So it's quite easy.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_01
 So what about, sorry, can I use that at the moment?

0:19:20	SPEAKER_07
 It's ready to get dialogue act.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_05
 So from the dialogue act level, I've not got it leaving any topic segments.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_05
 Just because that was the other priority.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, yeah, you can get all the options.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_07
 All right.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_07
 Yes, maybe just get stuck with me.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_01
 So what about a general layout like this that we have here, the dialogue acts and the player.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_01
 And here we'd have a search button and the similarity thing button.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, we got a search result.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_01
 Good question.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_05
 If we move everything to the right a little bit, make a little bar on the left.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_01
 I think we probably like, we can leave those like, I frames and just arrange them sort of.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_05
 Well, basically, we'll get something to print out their location.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_05
 So we'll arrange it.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 I'll turn it, typically, we'll have like the whole thing running already when we do the presentation.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_01
 And we just arrange it manually.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_05
 It's quite easy to do.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_01
 Apparently, Microsoft sometimes or like, at least in the past, the demonstration where they just exactly knew which 5% of the system we're working.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_01
 That's what we're going to do as well.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_01
 Has anyone ever seen anything from the other group?

0:20:44	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_05
 I have all.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just running everything again.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_00
 They've all sorts of...

0:20:49	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, just the label.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, of course we grew.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_07
 Re-access.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_05
 I'll just like it, print the same messages in the background.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_05
 Stand it out.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, dear.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_01
 If anything, we build in a time bomb that only fails if the date is the date of the presentation.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, because we are nice people.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_01
 If this rate thing, do we have any direct control to that or is that just directly controlling how fast it plays and sort of...

0:21:26	SPEAKER_01
 We can only...

0:21:27	SPEAKER_05
 It doesn't seem to work very well.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_05
 It's capable of slowing down the audio, but it's speeding up and it's seem to work too.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_01
 That's a pity because it looks like it's doing something.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_04
 Did you overtake that code from the original?

0:21:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, that's a...

0:21:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but also speeding up the...

0:21:45	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, it's all hard.

0:21:48	None
 It does that.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_01
 Do you think if we override that component and just override whatever the action to that slide bar is?

0:21:55	SPEAKER_05
 No, we'd have to look at that code and see what it actually does.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_05
 This thing is really bizarre. It slows it down, but it's speeding up and it's seem to work.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, maybe it has a different constructor when you...

0:22:09	SPEAKER_05
 Also, that grasp of algebra is terrible.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it should be minus p times. It should be half.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_05
 Sorry.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_07
 It's fine.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_05
 Because I'll be buying it backwards twice as quickly.

0:22:23	None
 Yeah.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_01
 So if something like they are skipping, would it actually cooperate with our system at the moment?

0:22:29	SPEAKER_01
 Would our skip automatically forward?

0:22:31	SPEAKER_05
 I should do the equate on passing with five.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I'd realize.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe that's the problem.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe they've got the minus and the code as well and then something messed up.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's just that it did do it.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_05
 It's not blind selection.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, whatever.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_07
 So do you think a tree view is for like an overview of the...

0:23:01	SPEAKER_07
 Is that everything?

0:23:02	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_01
 I think the simple...

0:23:04	SPEAKER_01
 The simple view that we get that you can just like pass things into and then check when they got clicked really.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_05
 Something that might be quite cool is if you could...

0:23:14	SPEAKER_05
 You know, like some applications when you open a file you get like a little preview.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_05
 If we could do something like that at this place like a five line summary, then you could go about the open a file.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I suppose you can calculate the morph lane and just have a little thumbnail or something.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_01
 We couldn't do some. I don't know.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_05
 Then we would have to over a...

0:23:36	SPEAKER_05
 Some are just quite quick.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_07
 It would be a bit pointless but we'd look into the preview.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_05
 I'm not convinced you get any kind of good quality summary.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_01
 In a sense, I mean if we...

0:23:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, like probably that would be the same thing that we also display up here because I really think that having like some...

0:23:55	SPEAKER_01
 But that would probably even be shorter than five lines.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_01
 Like really just getting, I think getting one or two best utterances for each segment would be really worthwhile.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_01
 For the search results, I probably think that instead of a simple summary, something that displays the utterance where the word was like displaced in a highlighted form where it was found.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_05
 Another quite good thing might be how easy is there a five two to...

0:24:24	SPEAKER_05
 Two plywood.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_05
 There's one that would be quite cool.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_05
 If on the search result you could give it each one a tool tip that had the context like the options before.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_05
 The options after.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it'd be nice for any whole values right now.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_01
 Well, alternatively we could always have sort of a third small component.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_01
 Whatever, like if this was the search results and then just like something else that's parked under it and when mouse goes over this one, it triggers that one to display or something.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, if we can get the tool tip.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_05
 The tool tip is I think a fairly straight.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_01
 I think it should be quite easy.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, especially with a tree view, we'll be able to get the tool tip fairly simply because it's just a property of it.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's why we...

0:25:05	SPEAKER_01
 I've never seen tool tips displaying several lines and stuff because I wonder how good that look, but we can try that.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_05
 It's quite common in some applications.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_01
 Really?

0:25:15	SPEAKER_01
 So far only some tool tips or view words length.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_01
 But yeah, that should be fairly easy.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we have a moving band.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_04
 We graphically display that also moves according to the...

0:25:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we will have that actually it's going to happen today and we will have proper segments as well.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_07
 Is that quite easy to do?

0:25:40	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I'm moving across.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_01
 The thing I have to find out how to do it without redrawing the display each time because the display at the moment does take.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_01
 You see like it takes a fraction of a second to display but probably too much to update it to completely repaint the whole thing every second.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_01
 So at the moment, I'm just, whenever it needs to be repainted, I'm not thinking about what to do and just repainting the thing as a whole.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_01
 With a moving bar, that's not a good idea.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_01
 But until I think of something better what I'll just do is I'll probably not have a moving bar the whole length but just some indicator somewhere like...

0:26:17	SPEAKER_01
...whatever, just a triangle moving at the bottom for now or something.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_01
 Then I can just like repaint a small area or something.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_05
 And yeah, we are clipping smaller.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_05
 It's just one value.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_05
 The height.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_05
 It doesn't change in value.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_05
 So if you just remember the color that was lost at, then you redraw a line behind it.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_05
 Is that color?

0:26:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I have to find out the commands for like really just redrawing a small piece.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_01
 So I have to just, there's examples for doing stuff like that I just have to read up on it.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_01
 But yet displaying the current position bar will be easy, provided that my whole calculations of like where we are in time here or correct.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, that's just something that isn't tested so far.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_01
 But it should be, I mean.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_01
 So the general concept, will you two just keep on working on improving the information density measures?

0:27:21	SPEAKER_01
 So do you think there'll be a point when you say, well, that's it.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_01
 We have an information density score and we'll be looking for something else to do.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_04
 I'm pretty sure that I can always find something to improve there.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_04
 So, I mean, if you need me to work on something else, I can try to finish my stuff early.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_04
 But otherwise I can still keep working on it, improving it, I think.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I don't actually, at the moment I don't see how many people can work on the programming anywhere.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_05
 Right now I'll put you into next semester.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_04
 So now I've finished all the meetings, I think, there's not that much to do unless I get some evaluation method.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_04
 So that could be quite difficult.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_04
 I would have to tag with some part of it or something.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_04
 Because if I can't evaluate, I can't do any better.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_04
 Because I don't know how to do better.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it's really cute.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I guess I mean...

0:28:41	SPEAKER_05
 There's my hope, we could just kind of cobble something together and just say, look, it's great.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_01
 I was a bit pissed off yesterday about that part because it was sort of just like a decision we had taken.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_01
 And I said, okay, we've been talking about evaluation in the first report.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_01
 There's nothing new we can say about it this time.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_01
 And I thought we said that in the meeting before we wrote the report.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_01
 And then he came back to the criticism saying, like, oh, you didn't say anything about evaluation.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_01
 And then everybody did it in the last report.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_01
 We said we're not going to go, oh, but now I expected it in more detail.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you didn't give a say, oh, if that translates to 80%, like if those actually translate to really like their percentage scores, then it would be good.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_05
 I think they did, that's the first 60%.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_05
 16, I thought they were 30% each.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_04
 I think they were 10% each.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_01
 They were 40% each and this is how they became 60%.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_01
 How much do you think they were?

0:29:39	SPEAKER_07
 I think they were 10.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, 10%.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_01
 Not bad.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_01
 We're also, it just means that he's relatively lenient because I mean, the reports were, I think they were good reports, but like, probably somebody else wouldn't have said they were excellent.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_01
 So that's a good sign that shows that he's not hell bent on you.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I suppose you can see the worker and work him.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_01
 And then he'll see the final display and he'll realize that it was all fake, then we didn't make it any of the work.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_05
 I think we ran through the address.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_05
 So I get how long it takes to actually software engineering.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, the interface and integration.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_01
 So the thing is, like for me personally, I think a lot of work will be done in the last minute in this specific case.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_01
 That's not a new state, but in general, but like the week just before the presentation, I have most of the stuff that I'm doing now.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_01
 I'm doing now, I'm rid of it, including the dissertation.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_01
 And still.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_07
 And it's the same for me.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_05
 So we'll just restart and stuff then, because we'll restart in the year.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_05
 That's an okay game.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_05
 And the DM.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, no, probably not.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_05
 Well, you're doing a few at the end of the year.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_07
 I'm going to do like an online museum archive.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_07
 You get a document, please.

0:31:00	None
 It's a little bit.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I kind of make the idea that he went about called LL and then went on to a good archive.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_07
 I'm not a good writer.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_05
 I think it might have been a bit of more like a chase, I think it's going to be quite hard.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, we'd have to do like music and stuff.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_05
 Well, we have to do it.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_05
 And picture.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_05
 Not too much.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_05
 So yeah.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_05
 So just to be honest, I think it's going to be a bit hard.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_01
 So, Jasmine, if you got something like this and like this for always your current data, would that help in sort of I've been promising this for a week now, realize I'm going to give you.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know if it's that.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_04
 It might be a help.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_01
 Because essentially at the moment, I mean, it's pretty much a question of copying it over it.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_01
 Over right.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_01
 It's just.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_05
 It's not easy at.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_01
 You can probably add a open file dialog box with minimal method because I think it's a ready-made component that returns the string for a file name.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_05
 Am I using the term file directly?

0:32:13	SPEAKER_01
 Or that.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_01
 So we can do that today.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_05
 It doesn't make sense to call it file.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_05
 Is more like an option.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but why don't you read everything just from one file.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, no, sure.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_01
 Like it would not necessarily need to be a part of the final thing, but why don't we just provide some means, even if it does it automatically in the beginning as a startup option just to ask for a file name.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_01
 Because then we can just publish a script that you just run and then this whole thing starts.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_01
 You know what happened to me today?

0:32:55	SPEAKER_01
 Like I forgot about the web.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if we had the problem before finding the Java media, the Java X media stuff and all the charts.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_01
 Like suddenly panicking the 11th whenever the schedule followed would be fairly straightforward to get it going here.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_01
 And then I got that thing.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so if we do a work which automatically opens up a file open box.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so you're automatically producing the right format with this with just patterns.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_04
 I print the utterances in the idea of the utterances.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_01
 So would it be easy slash just a difficult slash impossible like at the moment if you skip to a treating a whole series as one thing.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_01
 So like creating one file for the whole series that gives the address the ideas from top to bottom and.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_05
 Or even just the entire corpus.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_05
 That's what I'm going to say.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_04
 But the entire corpus.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_04
 If I just take one file or where one meeting is in.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_05
 This is easy to write.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_01
 Where do you think you can produce something like that?

0:34:20	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should go for like for one group not for the whole corpus.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_05
 I think it makes more sense to go for the whole corpus because the meat the.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_05
 The IDs gaps and stuff.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_05
 Otherwise, I mean to have to read.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_05
 List of options is when you're compiling all the data over and over and over again.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_04
 So you want the day like members to be.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_04
 I wrote the corpus so that second meeting was 300 something.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_01
 Never Dave.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, that's what I was thinking about.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_01
 Like the second meeting should continue to the first one stop and for one group.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_01
 That's true because it's sort of like their meetings, you know, like that one meeting.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_05
 The main data.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_05
 Just.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_05
 You need numbers for the entire corpus.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_05
 The utterances.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_01
 And that's.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_01
 It makes more sense to be anyway because that means you've got more flexibility.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_05
 One thing you really don't want is ever to have two options.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_05
 It could potentially have the same ID.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_01
 But it just doesn't make sense in the logic wise sort of like until here it's the meeting about this thing and then it's that thing and then it's this like.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_05
 That's the point of the data.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_05
 Could we.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_04
 Could we just take the name each.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_04
 Each dialogue act meeting.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_04
 And I like it number would be a normal name.

0:35:58	SPEAKER_05
 But it's not really much point because I'm a nice proxy that the dialogue act number also coincides with the array index number and the array of dialogue act.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_01
 Where's.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we're talking like so.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_01
 So your data manager would that then handle the whole thing?

0:36:15	SPEAKER_01
 Would that handle it?

0:36:16	SPEAKER_01
 That this would only like the display would only display one group.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_05
 Which is what you wanted.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_01
 So if I mean I don't mind where it's done.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_01
 So if the data manager filters it out and like.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_01
 I just think that in the logic of the program it's much easier to justify why we say we treat a series of meetings as one single thing rather than.

0:36:39	SPEAKER_05
 You know the interest in the same series each time you might want this way or meetings that had a particular phrase mentioned.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_05
 And those might not be the ones that we enumerate.

0:36:49	SPEAKER_05
 But I would just I would find logical reasons for why you can just say it's just good practice.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_05
 Like it separates the data.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_01
 But I see this to come in like deaf like I see each series each group is completely separate.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_05
 That shouldn't be forcing on the user when we don't have to.

0:37:34	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:37:36	SPEAKER_01
 But would it still like would be still in the logic of it still have continuous IDs if you say we take just just one meeting like would would the display for example still be able to just say.

0:37:45	SPEAKER_01
 I want from whatever from the first until the last and everything in between sort of and.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_01
 And the data manager would then display that just for that meeting.

0:37:55	SPEAKER_01
 Okay well if that's possible.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_04
 Have you currently got continuous IDs for your top.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_07
 I've only done the question.

0:38:05	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, yeah.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_04
 I've only done the all of them.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_07
 And for the topics.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_07
 The idea was that it would be.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_05
 I think it should be like that continuous and chronological.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_04
 Is that what you've got because different meeting series overlap.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:38:40	SPEAKER_04
 For example, yes, there are not F zero values for every speaker or sometimes not forever meeting.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_04
 How will I.

0:38:50	SPEAKER_04
 Count that.

0:38:52	SPEAKER_05
 I mean.

0:38:59	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, the moment I don't even generate any document document for those.

0:39:04	SPEAKER_04
 But because.

0:39:06	SPEAKER_04
 It's just a no.

0:39:11	SPEAKER_05
 I might be more sensitive because I got my average value.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_04
 I would not be better for the importance measure if that just wouldn't be part of it than.

0:39:31	SPEAKER_05
 Well, we don't use F zero.

0:39:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's where I said.

0:39:38	SPEAKER_01
 So you'd also say that it shouldn't be part of the importance measure if there's no zero.

0:39:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:39:51	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I don't know how we're going to do the fusing of the different important measures anyway.

0:39:56	SPEAKER_01
 If that's done in the program or if that's done offline.

0:40:05	SPEAKER_01
 Does anyone have a good idea like at the moment to play around with it?

0:40:08	SPEAKER_01
 What's a good way of displaying two types of information in the color display?

0:40:13	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, there's probably logical ways like if one is whatever if one is the darkness and the other is the redness or something.

0:40:18	SPEAKER_01
 Does anyone ever experiment with sort of displaying two dimensional information in color?

0:40:23	SPEAKER_01
 Because then we could do adjustments and wear us probably in the same scale.

0:40:27	SPEAKER_05
 Look at these red, green and blue this way up the tree.

0:40:32	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:40:33	SPEAKER_04
 But do we really want to display them separately because we use one.

0:40:38	SPEAKER_03
 No, for now.

0:40:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:40:40	SPEAKER_04
 For us.

0:40:41	SPEAKER_04
 It might be interesting to me that just the word importance.

0:40:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but then the user would have to know about what was what and what contributed to the blue stripes and what can you do with the language.

0:40:58	SPEAKER_01
 But I think probably for us, like in developing it would be interesting.

0:41:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so I'll try the red, green, blue.

0:41:10	SPEAKER_01
 Does anyone know what this hue and saturation thing like?

0:41:13	SPEAKER_01
 What's that?

0:41:14	SPEAKER_01
 Nobody's so much color work.

0:41:16	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know how to job.

0:41:18	SPEAKER_01
 It's not a problem of doing it.

0:41:20	SPEAKER_05
 I think the trouble is that hue isn't a very sensitive scale.

0:41:23	SPEAKER_05
 Like it comes up like red two or three times.

0:41:27	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:41:28	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:41:29	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I guess I'll just take a look at the Photoshop color cube or whatever it is, give them color cube and look at.

0:41:37	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, you could just split it into two blocks I suppose.

0:41:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:41:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:41:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:41:47	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll produce a version of this which opens up with a dialogue box where you can select the first one.

0:41:58	SPEAKER_01
 Select a file.

0:42:00	SPEAKER_01
 Is that right?

0:42:01	SPEAKER_01
 We'll be able to do that.

0:42:03	SPEAKER_01
 And then you'll get this type of display with that file.

0:42:10	SPEAKER_01
 That's at the moment.

0:42:12	SPEAKER_01
 So are we still talking about using that one meeting that everyone is using now?

0:42:15	SPEAKER_01
 Are we talking about swapping now?

0:42:17	SPEAKER_05
 It's very reasonable.

0:42:18	SPEAKER_05
 It's not swap meetings.

0:42:20	SPEAKER_05
 It's a data set for it.

0:42:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:42:25	SPEAKER_01
 So everyone should produce stuff for the whole corpus now.

0:42:29	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:42:30	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:42:31	SPEAKER_05
 It's a sensible way to do that.

0:42:33	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:42:34	SPEAKER_01
 We need the explicit information about each meeting then like sort of from which utterance to which utterance it goes and stuff.

0:42:42	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:42:43	SPEAKER_05
 Well, it's not reading that and yet that that will be part of the data management as well.

0:42:48	SPEAKER_05
 Is anyone access classes or different?

0:42:50	SPEAKER_01
 Is anyone providing that at the moment?

0:42:52	SPEAKER_05
 Does anyone?

0:42:53	SPEAKER_06
 Hmm.

0:42:55	SPEAKER_05
 Does each author and just got an idea associated with it?

0:42:59	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:43:00	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:43:01	SPEAKER_04
 It can be read, run, program that calculates all the for all our different contributions to the importance measure.

0:43:11	SPEAKER_04
 Absolute.

0:43:13	SPEAKER_04
 Data.

0:43:15	SPEAKER_04
 Act.

0:43:16	SPEAKER_04
 Numbers.

0:43:17	SPEAKER_04
 For the meeting.

0:43:18	SPEAKER_04
 Because at the moment we all produce the numbers for each meeting separately.

0:43:26	SPEAKER_05
 Where if you?

0:43:28	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:43:29	SPEAKER_05
 Just.

0:43:30	SPEAKER_05
 You might have to write number three.

0:43:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but we should all use the same program I think.

0:43:36	SPEAKER_04
 But prevent us from having too much mistakes in it.

0:43:41	SPEAKER_04
 Or at least mistakes would be consistent.

0:43:44	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, should be consistent.

0:44:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'm not sure about that.

0:44:07	SPEAKER_01
 As an I just don't understand much about how difficult it is to do different things.

0:44:14	SPEAKER_04
 No, it's not really difficult.

0:44:17	None
 It's.

0:44:18	SPEAKER_04
 And I can do it.

0:44:25	SPEAKER_04
 I can read in different.

0:44:28	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:44:29	SPEAKER_04
 Part of its measures.

0:44:31	SPEAKER_04
 As long as?

0:44:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:44:34	SPEAKER_04
 Recirculate the numbers.

0:44:36	SPEAKER_01
 As long as everything's in the right order it shouldn't like we should even be able to just ID it when we're reading it in.

0:44:43	SPEAKER_04
 We have got the index for converting from various IDs to your search.

0:44:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it should be.

0:44:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's done that for the correlation as well.

0:44:56	SPEAKER_04
 So that was quite easy.

0:45:01	SPEAKER_04
 Have you got that for?

0:45:03	SPEAKER_04
 No, it's just for one meeting at the moment.

0:45:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so if we email our script on how to like load it.

0:45:23	SPEAKER_01
 So yours would always be loaded in I guess like you there would only be one version of your data and you can just overwrite that version if you want.

0:45:34	SPEAKER_01
 I wouldn't have a file open dialog box for that then.

0:45:38	SPEAKER_05
 No, that's what it is.

0:45:42	SPEAKER_05
 Pointing it as file open.

0:45:44	SPEAKER_05
 So it would be open those files.

0:45:47	SPEAKER_05
 More sense.

0:45:49	SPEAKER_01
 Would the option be?

0:45:51	SPEAKER_05
 I'll just see if you can configure the location of all your files as an option.

0:45:56	SPEAKER_05
 But when it starts off it should just read them from the default list.

0:46:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, but like so make it an option which one it displays or which one it uses for the summarization or.

0:46:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that makes sense.

0:46:08	SPEAKER_01
 I was just thinking so that both Jasmine and where I could see their data working.

0:46:13	SPEAKER_05
 Of course, there's no reason why we can't make a development version that displays both as to when options, windows and to go after display.

0:46:24	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, obviously they'd have to pick which one to sync the clock.

0:46:28	SPEAKER_05
 So I'm not getting too much.

0:46:31	SPEAKER_01
 So add another dialog.

0:46:39	SPEAKER_05
 So we would have like each of those components for Jasmine and where I would say if you could make a change to your thing so it could display like it in two halves.

0:46:53	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:46:54	SPEAKER_05
 Or maybe three actually.

0:46:58	SPEAKER_05
 No, you top half one, but half the other and the third one and average you can change your parameters for.

0:47:06	SPEAKER_05
 And then yeah, I could easily make it throw up three different dialogues.

0:47:15	SPEAKER_01
 But would that not require three clocks and.

0:47:18	SPEAKER_05
 But that also means.

0:47:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, because the dialogue the display also gets the information about like the relative and the absolute time.

0:47:30	SPEAKER_01
 So that would be convenient if that's just if that's just one of that because otherwise it's getting messy.

0:47:35	SPEAKER_01
 So why don't we just make a swap in? Why don't we make a switch instead like.

0:47:39	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, no, no, still good because.

0:47:44	SPEAKER_01
 I don't want to do like three like three internal times because that's just getting messy.

0:47:52	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I guess really I mean like alternative you why don't we go for the simplest thing just create three scripts.

0:47:57	SPEAKER_01
 Or two scripts which load a parameter common line parameter which is which file to load and then it's just there.

0:48:04	SPEAKER_05
 Hold on.

0:48:05	SPEAKER_05
 Wouldn't it be three entirely times goes because only one six o'clock.

0:48:09	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:48:10	SPEAKER_05
 So absolutely real time.

0:48:14	SPEAKER_05
 That's what's displayed on that.

0:48:16	SPEAKER_05
 The bar is real time.

0:48:18	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:48:19	SPEAKER_05
 So they will open the same time.

0:48:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, would the others.

0:48:26	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, you just have three summarizes and then they all sync up with one clock.

0:48:30	SPEAKER_05
 No, only one of them.

0:48:32	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, the other one is just a static dialogue.

0:48:34	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, okay.

0:48:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yep, so we have three color displays like three or.

0:48:47	SPEAKER_05
 Are we not in the final version?

0:48:48	SPEAKER_05
 No, no, sure.

0:48:49	SPEAKER_01
 Or maybe just start with just two like without even combining them in any sophisticated way.

0:48:53	SPEAKER_01
 Just just two.

0:48:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:48:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, shall we wrap that up?

0:49:02	SPEAKER_01
 So sorry, I'm imposing.

0:49:05	SPEAKER_05
 How easy would it be to like as you can add arbitrary numbers of them.

0:49:10	SPEAKER_01
 You mean discontinuous?

0:49:12	SPEAKER_05
 I like different measures to the display.

0:49:17	SPEAKER_01
 If I have to do it like flexibly, then I probably.

0:49:23	SPEAKER_01
 Then it will not be significantly more difficult.

0:49:26	SPEAKER_01
 But is it worth any effort there?

0:49:28	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's going to take more than like an hour or something.

0:49:33	SPEAKER_01
 Because we'll never have more than two and we'll never have well, we'll either have one or two so in the end.

0:49:38	SPEAKER_01
 Because you don't have different versions of well, I guess you probably would have.

0:49:45	SPEAKER_01
 But then also we'd have to find more sophisticated ways of loading it.

0:49:49	SPEAKER_05
 Specifying the parameters so that might be easy because one can type any number.

0:49:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but that we would have to have some dialogue box problems there.

0:50:02	SPEAKER_01
 It might take half an hour in the display not more than that.

0:50:05	SPEAKER_05
 Mine needs to make a minor addition.

0:50:09	SPEAKER_05
 I think it might not really be worth it to be honest.

0:50:17	SPEAKER_01
 Let's work on the other stuff first, like the other stuff and just provide like something where each of them just if there's an adjustment script and a error script and they each can load their stuff and see their data in the thing.

0:50:37	SPEAKER_01
 They can see it summarized by their data and the other one is the static one.

0:50:43	SPEAKER_01
 That should be fairly easy to do, right? If I just double the display and you make a like non-synced up second dialogue act and then they can fine tune their measures.

0:51:05	SPEAKER_01
 I think it would be cool if we could check the night clock code or whatever code it is for this component and see if we can access those right things and do something useful for them and get notified when they change and stuff.

0:51:19	SPEAKER_05
 We could just make that right be something completely different, just disconnected from whatever it's doing.

0:51:26	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I think that's what we should do.

0:51:31	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's probably an easy task to read that rate, but it's probably more difficult to get an event automatically when it's changed.

0:51:38	SPEAKER_01
 So that's why we might have to extend night clock and like override the function that reacted to that.

0:51:43	SPEAKER_01
 Like the rate is probably a property which in the worst case we'd have to set public, but if we want to react to it being changed automatically, we might have to.

0:51:52	SPEAKER_05
 It doesn't react to it being changed automatically.

0:52:00	SPEAKER_05
 So they haven't...

0:52:02	SPEAKER_05
 So you have to stop it.

0:52:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:52:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so it shouldn't like even if we have to extend night clock, I mean it should just be a matter of changing one single method in it.

0:52:14	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I mean just disconnected from whatever it sends immediately.

0:52:19	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:52:20	SPEAKER_05
 And connect it out to our summarises and like different levels on me.

0:52:23	SPEAKER_05
 There's like we could make that not even have like a real sort of meaning just like Max and Min.

0:52:33	SPEAKER_05
 And the user can just like say in between.

0:52:36	SPEAKER_05
 That's like what I was out actually telling them what I actually mean.

0:52:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:52:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:52:43	SPEAKER_01
 And we could justify all sorts of stuff like that in the presentation by saying we deliberately tried to keep any complexity and numbers and stuff away from people.

0:52:52	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's sort of a line we should go by in general sort of saying yeah we could have done so many...

0:52:57	SPEAKER_05
 It's like the label, it's like minus four times as well.

0:53:01	SPEAKER_05
 It's actually incredible.

0:53:03	SPEAKER_01
 You don't want to confuse people.

0:53:05	SPEAKER_01
 We give people something simple and colorful where something is moving and whether they don't have to deal with any numbers or text or anything like that for that matter.

0:53:13	SPEAKER_01
 In fact, that's why we've given you a picture of a dog sitting in a field instead of a meeting browser.

0:53:20	SPEAKER_01
 It is nice and it comes people down.

0:53:23	SPEAKER_04
 So what kind of change will you impose on the summarization because if we find you know, according to that and it's not finished, it doesn't move in a sense.

0:53:33	SPEAKER_05
 We won't make any huge changes.

0:53:36	SPEAKER_05
 I always have the ability to read your issue on.

0:53:40	SPEAKER_05
 It might be quite cool to have a combined measure.

0:53:43	SPEAKER_05
 It's just a weighted average.

0:53:50	SPEAKER_04
 So at the moment you have got a threshold and everything that's about it is displayed.

0:53:56	SPEAKER_05
 It just takes the top 20 or 50.

0:53:59	SPEAKER_04
 So it's some kind of threshold that is...

0:54:02	SPEAKER_04
 So, okay.

0:54:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yep.

0:54:13	SPEAKER_01
 Shall we meet in an hour or so today?

0:54:17	SPEAKER_01
 Probably going to eat something.

0:54:19	SPEAKER_05
 I was going to go to the gym at about three.

0:54:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, I was planning the same, but we won't get so much done before three, that's the thing.

0:54:28	SPEAKER_05
 To be honest, it's much quicker to get stuff done on my own.

0:54:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, listen.

0:54:40	SPEAKER_01
 So why don't we meet after three then?

0:54:42	SPEAKER_05
 Then I can like until three, make sure that I have all the display.

0:54:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, sure.

0:54:50	SPEAKER_01
 So we can meet at five and I have the display code ready by then, which does the stuff like...

0:54:57	SPEAKER_01
 Like having a bar where the position isn't stuff.

0:55:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:55:02	SPEAKER_05
 And I'll meet say five to seven.

0:55:04	SPEAKER_05
 That should be an hour.

0:55:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:55:08	SPEAKER_05
 Because yeah, it's much quicker if we're both working separately, I think.

0:55:12	SPEAKER_05
 Because when we've been working together, I've just not got a lot done.

0:55:16	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, that's true.

0:55:17	SPEAKER_05
 And like when I go home I'll spend like the same amount of time and get loads.

0:55:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:55:22	SPEAKER_01
 So we can meet at five and apple in power and just work on...

0:55:28	SPEAKER_01
 So I'll make sure that my display does all the stuff we can talk about it.

0:55:32	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:55:33	SPEAKER_01
 Until then.

0:55:35	SPEAKER_01
 And then we'll put those things together.

0:55:38	SPEAKER_08
 Okay.

0:55:40	SPEAKER_07
 I'll be working on the search, I think.

0:55:42	SPEAKER_07
 It's ready to start.

0:55:44	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I'm usually not coming.

0:55:46	SPEAKER_07
 I can show you how the DM manager works.

0:55:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:55:55	SPEAKER_01
 But I mean, like we should discuss together which, like, how the search interacts with the rest.

0:56:02	SPEAKER_01
 So that's not something that Colin should just do in his own.

0:56:08	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:56:27	None
 Okay.

0:56:47	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:57:08	None
 Okay.

0:57:27	None
 Okay.

0:57:47	None
 Okay.

0:58:07	None
 Okay.

0:58:27	None
 Okay.

0:58:47	None
 Okay.
