0:00:00	None
 So, I hope you're ready.

0:00:24	SPEAKER_03
 For this functional design team.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_03
 So, I will take the minutes.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_03
 You three are going to the presentation.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_03
 And we want to know, at the end, to know the new project's requirement.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_03
 So, we need to know the user needs that we want to fulfill.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_03
 From the technical part, we want to know how it's going to work.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_03
 And the part, I don't remember.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's not very good.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, how to design this.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_03
 Nice stuff.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_03
 So, let's go for the presentation.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_03
 So, for the marketing expert.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_05
 So, it's being modified.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_05
 Do you want to open it?

0:01:52	SPEAKER_05
 I hope I saved it.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_05
 So, this is my name.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_05
 So, as you know, I think you already know me.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_05
 I'm a very Benjou. I'm the expert in marketing.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_05
 And I want to tell you about what people won't.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_05
 And this like in remote controls.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_05
 And I hope this is going to help you to design it correctly.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_05
 So, next please.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_00
 The full page presentation.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_05
 I spend a lot of time doing this presentation.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_05
 So, basically, what I suggest is that instead of deciding ourselves what could be and what should be good remote control, let's ask people who are users of remote controls, how they feel about the correct remote controls, what they like, what they don't like, and what they do with them, by the way, because they're supposed to be useful.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_05
 Don't forget about that.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_05
 So, we've conducted a survey on the use of remote controls.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_05
 And I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_05
 Next please.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah. So, basically, what we found was that there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_05
 First of all, they find it very ugly.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_05
 Current remote controls, as you know, they are the same as this one.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_05
 They're not nice color, not nice shape.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_05
 They're all the same.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_05
 And they're not good looking.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_05
 What is interesting is that, in fact, it seems that people are ready to pay for a nice and fancy looking remote control.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_05
 So, I think we should spend lots of time in effort in that.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_05
 And the other thing is that the correct remote controls are not so easy to use.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_05
 And the current facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_05
 For instance, we see that the zap very often.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_05
 So, I think this is a very important functionality.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_05
 It should be easy for them to zap in one way or another.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_05
 And most of the buttons on current remote controls are not used.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_05
 So, I think we should design something where some of the buttons, which are those that are used, should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_05
 Next, please.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_05
 Now, people are very frustrated with their remote controls.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_05
 For instance, they don't even find it.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_05
 It's often lost somewhere in your home and nobody knows where it is.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control, please, where are you?

0:05:17	SPEAKER_05
 Like, I think some of the phones have some of these kind of functionality.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_05
 Of course, phone you can always phone your phone, but you can't phone your phone.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_05
 But why not?

0:05:33	SPEAKER_05
 And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use, in fact, they don't even know how to use them.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_05
 So, most of the people say they don't know how to use properly their remote controls.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_05
 And they are bad for RSI, but I don't remember what is RSI.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_05
 So, I think they are bad.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_02
 That's not right.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_05
 Nobody has any idea about that?

0:06:06	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I'll check it with my...

0:06:08	SPEAKER_00
 Ultramagnetic waves or something.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a technical thing, because infrared uses some ultramagnetic.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_04
 So, it's just an extra sound.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_04
 It's another people fault.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_05
 Concept that we don't know.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_05
 But we have to take this into account.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_05
 It's a different force.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_04
 People really like some of us knows.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_05
 So, anyway, that's for what the biggest frustration of the user.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_05
 What else do I have?

0:06:40	SPEAKER_05
 Next slide.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_05
 So, we've listed a couple of functions that may be used by the user in the current available remote controls.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_05
 The table is not very nice to read, but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often, because in general you use it only once per session, but it is very relevant.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_05
 People want to have a power button.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_05
 So, the internal selection is often used, very often used, and indeed very relevant.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_05
 Now I remember what is RSI.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_05
 It's rapid-tvt stress injury.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_05
 We have to be careful with that word.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_05
 Anyway, I got into my presentation.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_05
 So, yeah, channel selection is very important, very often used.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_05
 Volume is not often used, but people want to have control and volume, and that makes sense, of course.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_05
 And then you have things which are very much less often used, like the settings, audio settings, screen settings, even teletext and channel settings.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_05
 They are not often used, and they are more or less relevant. It seems that people find teletext relevant, even if I personally never use it, but it seems that it's average relevant at least.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_03
 I've been told that we don't consider teletext that it's out of date because of internet.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_05
 I can tell you that in a scale between 1 and 10, not relevant to relevant people scored 6 on this, which is not as these two ones had, I think, 10.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_05
 But if you compare with these ones, I think they scored a 1 or 2, not very relevant.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_05
 If there are good reason not to put teletext, it's okay, but just know that people find it somehow relevant.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_05
 That's for the main functions, I think.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_05
 And then we can ask ourselves what people don't have that may be useful, for instance, I think net-next slide.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_05
 One of the things that the trend that you are probably aware of is the possibility, the eventual possibility of having special recognition in your remote control.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_05
 So you wouldn't have to tap in your buttons, but just tell your remote control or whatever you need to have what you want.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_05
 So we've conducted a survey about whether people would like or not to have this kind of functionality in their remote control.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_05
 And as we can see, it really depends on the age.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_05
 Young people, probably because it's a buzzword, find it very relevant.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_05
 And as the age goes up, the relevance goes down.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_05
 So now it really depends on the kind of targeting, who are we targeting with this remote control?

0:10:01	SPEAKER_05
 I think if we're targeting young people, then it's probably something we have to consider.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_05
 If we're targeting young people, this is something that we don't know why this should be.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_05
 So now this is of course depends on that.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_05
 And I don't have any conclusion, I didn't have time, the meeting was very tight.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_05
 So that's basically my findings.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_05
 If you have any question.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's good, okay?

0:10:29	SPEAKER_05
 I can really give you one question.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, one question.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_04
 You're a market expert, so should we aim at young people or not?

0:10:37	SPEAKER_05
 I think we should aim at young people.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_05
 But I think there are those who might be more interested in the new device.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_05
 And generally, the early adopters of new device are young people less than...

0:10:52	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, more than...

0:10:53	SPEAKER_05
...central text is useless.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_05
 Then the text is useless for the money, because they have other means of finding their information.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_05
 That's a good point.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_05
 Thank you.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_03
 So now I think it's the turn of the...

0:11:18	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_03
 Of the technical function?

0:11:32	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:11:33	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's you.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_00
 What if you...

0:11:39	SPEAKER_05
 You are a requirement.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_00
 I have to do working design too.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_04
 I'll start with number three.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_04
 So my name is Mark Dwight, and I'm responsible for user interface design.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_04
 However, the project manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_04
 I'm a more anarchist.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_04
 That's going to be less technical functions, but more user interface and current intentions.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_04
 Everything which is linked to this.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_04
 So, next slide please.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_04
 And the general method which seems to be very useful for our task is not to forget about the outcome razor.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_04
 We should never complicate things too much.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_04
 We should only make a remote control.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_04
 Nothing more.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_04
 Nothing more than this.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_04
 Just remote control.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_04
 Because current remote controls, they are never easy enough to use.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_04
 So, make a click this.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_04
 So, here is the remote control.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_04
 It's quite a standard one, but it's not from a TV.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_04
 It's from a much easier device like air condition or something.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_04
 But you know, we can use it for a TV easily.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_04
 Only buttons when it is on off, volume, channels, and maybe some options or something else.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_04
 And please make a click.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_04
 Compared to this one.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_04
 Which one would you prefer?

0:13:42	SPEAKER_04
 I guess this.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_05
 I would say the simplest one as long as I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_04
 Sure.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it can be middle of between those two.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_04
 And our method is going to be provide simple, simple desires into simple actions.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_05
 Nice.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_05
 Nice sentence.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_04
 Fudding.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, sorry.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_04
 Our question is a style.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_04
 We should remember that our company puts fashion into electronics.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_04
 And we should never forget about it.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_04
 Concept.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_04
 Simple.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_04
 The simple and you lean on this market.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_04
 Market of remote controls, you know it better.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_04
 It's very... wow.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_04
 It's not an easy feel to play, you know.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_04
 So be simple.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_04
 For personal preferences.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_04
 I think that to make a baby proof remote control, it got to be a titanium.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_04
 It's a really good style.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_04
 It's going to be look like this.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_04
 It is unbreakable and it is very universal.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_04
 We'll have a screen with a backlight that can change colors.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_04
 And we can put all the options into the screen.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_04
 We'll need only few buttons.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_04
 All the other things can be controlled through the screen.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_04
 And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_04
 Because when you watch a movie and you want to change something, you always try to find a good button and click it.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_04
 But you should do it by touching it and finally easily just by touching.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_04
 So...

0:15:53	SPEAKER_04
 I would propose this concept for design.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_04
 Just few buttons, a screen with a backlight, which can change colors.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_04
 To tan you, think and what else.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_04
 I could just wear a few good ideas.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_04
 We need power and volume.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_04
 And let us include two nice features into this device.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_04
 First, power on and off can be made fully automatic.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_04
 When you go to the sofa, take your control and point it to the TV.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_03
 It turns on.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_04
 The TV turns on.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_05
 And when does it turn off?

0:16:37	SPEAKER_04
 When you don't touch the control, but you go out of it for enough time.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_05
 Sensing sensor machine that...

0:16:46	SPEAKER_04
 It's a question to our technical design hour to engineers.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_04
 And another nice feature that I would like to implement is the volume control.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_04
 Suppose you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_04
 Like you want to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or...

0:17:14	SPEAKER_04
 You want to...

0:17:15	SPEAKER_04
 Something.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_04
 And then the volume changes.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_04
 It's easy to do.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_04
 And then you control the...

0:17:22	SPEAKER_05
 According to your distance.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_05
 And the angle maybe if you have a...

0:17:26	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_05
 I'm not sure about the screen.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_05
 What is the usefulness of the screen?

0:17:32	SPEAKER_05
 Is it a touch screen, by the way?

0:17:35	SPEAKER_04
 I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with the left right, up, down and down.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_05
 So it gives instructions but it has to be then backlight somehow.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_04
 So it's main purpose in fact is the backlight.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_04
 Which change colors, which makes it easy to find.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_04
 And it can respond for your voice like it can turn on the light for you just to find it easily.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_04
 So basically that's it.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_03
 And I see that you target several applications not only TV but like we talk about universal remote control.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_04
 It can be easily done because you got simple designs.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_04
 We should put it to simple actions.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_04
 Let it be universal.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_04
 So you want to use it for your high-fi system.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_04
 You want to change tracks and you want to just volume.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_04
 Just few actions.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_04
 Few actions for everything.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_04
 Also rest we will put it into this menu on the screen.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_03
 Since we were targeting a really soon date for the issue of this remote control, I think we will only concentrate on TV for the moment.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_04
 But it's quite universal.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_04
 We can just extend it to any device.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_05
 For instance, if I want to go directly to channel 25, how would I do?

0:19:13	SPEAKER_05
 Can I do that with this?

0:19:15	SPEAKER_05
 25.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, let's say I'm on channel 8 now.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_05
 You know, these days we have hundreds of channels.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_05
 That's not so easy to go just next, next, next when you have hundreds of channels.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_04
 In fact, I would propose another solution.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_04
 Basically you use just four or five channels.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_04
 Most people, yeah.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_04
 So set up your TV set like channels that you use.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_04
 They are one, two, three, and five.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_04
 And you will never have to go to a 25.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_05
 In fact, in one remote control that I've seen, instead of doing that, you could just say these are the channel 3, 28, 48, and 64.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_05
 Are those that I want to be cycled with my next button?

0:20:01	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it's the same solution.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_00
 But even we can have some LCD display that you can go to channel 35.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_05
 But on the number one thing is that as I said in my presentation, people really do like to zap.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_05
 So even if they are only watching four or five channels, I think they want to zap out of the 100 channels just because this is one kind of thing they do.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and zap it's only next, next, next, next.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_05
 So that you have to go to this button here.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_04
 Next, next.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_04
 Or say this can be back.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_00
 But otherwise we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_00
 So it was two five, they just press two and five and then.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we can make different modes for each button.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_03
 You can change the zapping mode or...

0:20:54	SPEAKER_03
 How are you?

0:20:55	SPEAKER_03
 Curiently.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_00
 We were focusing only on TV remote control.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_00
 So we can have more functions for TV.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_00
 If you want to go for universal then we have to limit for functions for each of our devices.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_04
 Could we carry out some research if we really need this?

0:21:15	SPEAKER_04
 Like how many people really need to go to channel number 25 and then to 64?

0:21:20	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, I could...

0:21:22	SPEAKER_05
 Could have a look at that.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_05
 I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_05
 Although I don't know.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_04
 Thanks for your attention.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_03
 So now the technical aspects of this new device.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry, but first...

0:22:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_00
 I'm Mr. Ramaro.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_00
 I'm an expert in industrial design of all electronic devices.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_00
 I've previously devised many digital calculators and electronic calculators.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_00
 So now I briefly describe the working design of our remote control.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_00
 Well, as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the device like TV or VCR or DVD player etc.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_00
 So we will have a portable device which will send message to the main device like TV.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_00
 So we need to have some energy source to do what... to do the functions what we want on this portable device.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_00
 And usually this...

0:23:06	SPEAKER_00
 So to do these functions we need an interface.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_00
 It's basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_00
 And then these messages, these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_00
 And then it will generate some information to the main device.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_00
 It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of sensor information.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_00
 Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_00
 So basically we need... since we are focusing on our interface device that's our remote control.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_00
 We need few components, mainly the energy source, like the battery.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_00
 And then we have user interface like the keypad and buttons we want.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_00
 And then we have some chip, it's mainly distal signal processing chip because since we are...

0:24:15	SPEAKER_00
 I want doing mostly distal devices we have to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some distal format.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_00
 And then we will have the infrared LED source which sends the information to the main device.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_00
 Then we will have switch in our main device to do particular operations.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_00
 And we have to do different codes for different TVs.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_00
 So some TVs will have different encryption codes for doing channel changing and these things.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_03
 So we need to make it a universal device.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_00
 Because people don't use one particular band so at least we have more than five bands which are really good.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_00
 So we need to check their specifications and do their encryption that's passing information to the TV device.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_00
 So we need to have particular encryption codes.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_00
 Then components, so we have the main energy source and then we will have some buttons.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_00
 And then we will have infrared source and then we have some inside some chip in the device.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_00
 Since I don't have much time so I didn't put the connection to all these components.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_00
 And since I also want to know feedback from our marketing expert and user interface.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_00
 So if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_03
 From the discussion we had, can you make it on the whiteboard?

0:25:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I'm sure because since our user interface engineers suggesting speech recognition and also marketing expert found that speech recognition is really handy.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_00
 So we can have another simple speech recognition on our DSP chip.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_00
 Since we have some kind of energy this is our normal battery.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_00
 So this battery once you switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our generally small digital signal processing chip.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_00
 So that and we will put other small simple speech recognition.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_00
 And we can also try and this speech recognition for a particular user.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_00
 So you just...

0:26:48	SPEAKER_00
 I need to.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, such which issues simple...

0:26:52	SPEAKER_00
 True contacts.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_05
 But very good to sell.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have this voice, dealers or these things.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_05
 For all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_05
 And you cannot choose my remote control because it started it to me.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_03
 And what about the price of this component?

0:27:19	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can make within 5 euros and even less than that because we want to have billions and in bulk so we can make really simple.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_00
 And we want to make really simple device because we have only very few words like like power switch on or some like then we will have something like this.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_00
 We will have volume and then we will have particular channel.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_00
 So users can...

0:27:51	SPEAKER_05
 So user will just be able to say please can you pop up the volume or it will be something like volume up.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_00
 The user can use any kind of sentiment but they should have this prompted words volume and...

0:28:06	SPEAKER_03
 With a keyword.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, volume and decrease or increase. So we try to only recognize code words and because we can't really say user to say same word and then it becomes more mechanical.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_00
 And then we can have channel they can say okay I want 8 because we don't know like users have different programs.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_00
 They don't really follow same channels, we just want channel number.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_00
 We don't want like BBC or CNN or...

0:28:34	SPEAKER_00
 Of course it has to be complicated. So we will have only this 3 main basic.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem it will be takeer of our main.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_04
 No, it's a conceptual question because now I see this is the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting him to it.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_04
 But I think he's coming no he's really not with this.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_05
 First of all I think this is not a functionality that is going to be instead of using the buttons.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_05
 On top of using the button.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_04
 Okay for this budget like 12 euros.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_04
 Well I don't know.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_00
 Actually we can have one switch to like switch on and off this day's be processor and this really parallel to the suppose like here.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_00
 We have our main chip which controls power volume and this buttons and this DSP.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_00
 Again these two have some interaction like suppose people use DSP then it vertically sends some information to the chip like in some form like volume increase or like this key.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_00
 So it will not be like very expensive because since we are only focusing on TV remote controls and we have only few things here.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_04
 Did you consider as a gesture recognition like if I want to put volume up I like to take my remote control do something like volume up or volume down.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_00
 At this point we didn't consider because it's very expensive.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_00
 It's very expensive because our target is only like 12.5 euros.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_03
 What about the idea of automatic on off on?

0:30:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah even automatic on off is also a bit problematic because different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really they just they don't touch the remote and you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off and should we target a user personalized the remote control.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_05
 So in a given room there might be more than one remote control we would have each one. Yeah and with our own personal settings.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah that can be possible especially for power settings so user can say okay.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_00
 Suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay after one hour.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_00
 They can make addons.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah I want to the object.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_05
 That's the problem we will sell more.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_02
 We can increase the settings.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_02
 You can buy more.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah that's more.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_03
 You have something else to say.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_00
 Not very much.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_03
 Thanks.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_02
 So.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_03
 I think.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_03
 We're just on time.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_03
 So we are now going to have the lunch break.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_03
 Great.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_03
 We will work again for 30 minutes individual work and we will meet again for the next meeting.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_03
 And in this one we want to be more focused on the individual actions on the components.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_03
 You will focus on the component concept.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_03
 Of course the UID mark will be focused on the user interface concept.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_03
 And our market expert, Sami Benjo, on the train watching.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal coach.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's all.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_03
 And we have maybe we have to we say only for TV not a late text.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_03
 I think automatic on off control.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_03
 It's not possible.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_00
 It's a current price.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe in the next step if we make it work.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_00
 But speech recognition can be possible.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. We can think about that.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_03
 Do you see something else?

0:33:44	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_04
 Should it be equipped with speakers?

0:33:57	SPEAKER_05
 Speakers.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_04
 Like you want to find it.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_04
 You shout.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_04
 Control.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_04
 And it answers.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_05
 It just beeps.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_03
 Or maybe you want to phone him.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_05
 But it's now expensive.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_00
 Especially the power.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_00
 It really consumes because it should be all the time on.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_05
 And I heard of devices where you just whistle them.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_05
 And because of the frequency.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_05
 I can't answer to that.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_05
 We don't know.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_05
 Or a clap.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_05
 You can clap.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_02
 Clap.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_05
 Clap.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_05
 It's good.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_05
 Just what about us?

0:34:46	SPEAKER_05
 We have only one hand.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_00
 He's another target people.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_00
 But it's a good feature.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_00
 We need to think about how to incorporate.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_04
 We don't interfere with other devices.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_04
 Because always people do that the lights are turning on with clapping.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_04
 Oh.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_05
 That already exists.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_05
 I got to touch my phone.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_05
 You do have.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_03
 Just handy.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_03
 So let's think.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_03
 Think about it.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_03
 I think that could be the component concept.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_03
 Good.

0:35:29	None
 Great.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_03
 Let's go to my team.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you very much.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you very much.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.
