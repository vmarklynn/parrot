0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 So I hope you're ready.

0:00:29	SPEAKER_03
 For this functional design team, of course.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_03
 So I will take the minutes.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_03
 You three are going to do presentation.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_03
 And we want to know, at the end, to know the new projects requirement.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_03
 So we need to know the user needs that we want to fulfill.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_03
 From the technical part, we want to know how it's going to work.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_03
 And the part...

0:01:09	SPEAKER_03
 I don't remember.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_03
 This is not very good.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, how to design this stuff.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_03
 So let's go for the presentation.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_05
 So first, marketing expert.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_05
 So I don't know if I can do that like this.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_05
 So is being modified, do you want...

0:01:49	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, open it only.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_05
 I hope I saved it.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_05
 So...

0:01:56	SPEAKER_05
 Benjung.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_05
 I know, just my name.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_05
 So as you know, I think you already know me, Sammy Benjio.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_05
 I'm the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people want and like and dislike in remote controls.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_05
 And I hope this is going to help you to design it correctly.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_05
 So next, please.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it is good.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_00
 The full page presentation.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, maybe in the full page because I spend lots of time doing this presentation.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_05
 So basically what I suggest is that instead of deciding ourselves what...

0:02:44	SPEAKER_05
 That could be and what should be good, the remote control.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_05
 Let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about the current remote controls, what they like, what they don't like and what they do with them, by the way, because they are supposed to be useful.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_05
 Don't forget about that.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_05
 So we've conducted a survey on the use of remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_05
 Next, please.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_05
 So basically what we found was that there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_05
 First of all, they find it very ugly.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_05
 Current remote controls, as you know, they are the same as this one.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_05
 They are not nice color, not nice shape, all the same.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_05
 And they are not good looking.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_05
 What is interesting is that in fact it seems that people are ready to pay for a nice and fancy looking remote control.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_05
 So I think we should pretty spend lots of time and effort in that.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_05
 And the other thing is that the current remote controls are not so easy to use and the current facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_05
 For instance, we see that the ZAP very often.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_05
 So I think this is a very important functionality.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_05
 It should be easy for them to ZAP in one way or another.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_05
 And most of the buttons on the current remote controls are not used.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_05
 So I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_05
 Next, please.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_05
 Now people are very frustrated with their remote controls.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_05
 For instance, they don't even find it.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_05
 It's often lost somewhere in your home and nobody knows where it is.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control, please, where are you?

0:05:17	SPEAKER_05
 Something to like I think phones, some of the phones have some of these kind of functionality.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_05
 Of course phone you can always phone your phone.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_05
 You can't phone your remote.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_05
 But why not?

0:05:33	SPEAKER_05
 And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use, in fact they don't even know how to use them.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_05
 So most of the people say they don't know how to use properly their remote controls.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_05
 And they are bad for AirAssy but I don't remember what is AirAssy.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_05
 So I think they are bad.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_02
 That's not it.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_05
 AirAssy.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_05
 Nobody has any idea about that?

0:06:05	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I'll check with my...

0:06:08	SPEAKER_00
 Electromagnetic waves or something.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's a technical thing which...

0:06:13	SPEAKER_00
 Because infrared uses some electromagnetic...

0:06:15	SPEAKER_00
 Electromagnetic.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_00
 So it seems like a 6%.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_05
 So a lot of people call concept that we don't know.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_05
 But we have to take this into account.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_05
 Every force, you know.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_04
 Every people really, some of us knows.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_05
 So anyway, that's for what the biggest frustration of the user and what else do I have?

0:06:39	SPEAKER_05
 Next slide.

0:06:40	None
 Oh, yeah.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_05
 So we've listed a couple of functions that may be used by the user in the current available remote controls.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_05
 And well, the table has been very nice to read.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_05
 But what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_05
 But it is very relevant.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_05
 People want to have a power button.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_05
 Visual selection is often used, very often used, and indeed very relevant.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_05
 Now I remember what is RSI.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_05
 It's rapid TBT stress injury.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_05
 We have to be careful with that word.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_05
 Anyway, I got into my presentation.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_05
 So yeah, channel selection is very important, very often used.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_05
 Volume is not often used, but people want to have control on volume and that makes sense, of course.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_05
 And then you have things which are very much less often used, like the settings, audio settings, screen settings, even teletext and channel settings.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_05
 All of them, they are not often used and they are more or less relevant.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_05
 It seems that people find teletext relevant, even if I personally never use it, but it seems that it's average relevant at least.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_03
 I have been told that we don't consider teletext that it's out of date because of internet.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_05
 I can tell you that in a scale between 1 and 10 relevant, not relevant to relevant people score the 6 on this, which is not as these two ones were had I think 10.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_05
 But if you compare with these ones, I think they scored a 1 or 2, not very relevant.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_05
 So if there are good reasons not to put teletext, it's okay, but just know that people find it somehow relevant.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_05
 That's for the main functions I think.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_05
 And then we can ask ourselves what people don't have that may be useful, for instance, I think next slide.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_05
 One of the things, the trend that you are probably aware of is the possibility, the eventual possibility of having special recognition in your remote control.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_05
 So you wouldn't have to tap in your buttons, but just tell your remote control or whatever unit you have, what you want.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_05
 So we've conducted a survey about whether people would like or not to have this kind of functionality in their remote control.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_05
 And as we can see, it really depends on the age.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_05
 Young people, probably because it's a buzzword, find it very relevant.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_05
 And as the age goes up, the relevance goes down.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_05
 So now it really depends on the kind of targeting, who are we targeting with this remote control.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_05
 I think if we are targeting young people, then it's probably something we have to consider.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_05
 If we are targeting young, very old people, this is something that we don't know why it should be.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_05
 So now this is of course, depends on that.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_05
 And I don't have any conclusion, I didn't have time, the meeting was very tight.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_05
 So that's basically my findings.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_05
 If you have any question?

0:10:25	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's good, okay.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_03
 I can rely on one question.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_03
 One question.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, one question.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_04
 You're a market expert.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_04
 So should we aim at young people or not?

0:10:36	SPEAKER_05
 I think we should aim at the young people.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_05
 But I think there are those who might be more interested in a new device.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_05
 In general, the early adopters of a new device are young people less than...

0:10:51	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_05
 Zental text is useless.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_05
 Zental text is useless for them, I think.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_05
 Because they have other means of finding their information.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_05
 But that's a good point.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_03
 So now I think it's the turn of the...

0:11:23	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_03
 Of the technical function?

0:11:31	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:11:32	SPEAKER_00
 Do I think it's you?

0:11:34	SPEAKER_00
 No?

0:11:35	SPEAKER_00
 That's my question.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_05
 What if...

0:11:38	SPEAKER_05
 So you're a requirement now?

0:11:42	None
 Yeah.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_00
 I have to do working design too.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_04
 So you...

0:11:50	SPEAKER_04
 That's just what number?

0:11:53	None
 Three.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_04
 So my name is Mark Twight and I'm responsible for user interface design.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_04
 However, the product manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_04
 I assume more an artist.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_04
 That's going to be less technical functions, but more user interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_04
 So next slide please.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_04
 And the general method which seems to be very useful for our task is not to forget about the outcome razor.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_04
 We should never complicate things too much.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_04
 We should only make a remote control.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_04
 Nothing more.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_04
 Nothing more than this.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_04
 Just remote control.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_04
 Because current remote controls, they are never easy enough to use.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_04
 So make it click this.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_04
 So here is user mode control.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_04
 It's quite a standard one, but it's not from a TV.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_04
 It's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_04
 But you know, we can use it for a TV easily.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_04
 Any buttons we need is on off volume channels and maybe some options or some snails.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_04
 And please make a click compared to this one.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_04
 Which one would you prefer?

0:13:40	None
 I guess this.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_05
 I would say the simplest one as long as there are the, I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_04
 Sure.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_00
 And maybe a middle of like between those two.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_04
 And our method is going to be provide simple, simple desires into simple actions.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_05
 Nice.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_05
 Nice sentence.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_04
 Fighting.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, sorry.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_04
 Our passion is a style.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_04
 We should remember that our company boots fashion into electronics.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_04
 And we should never forget about it.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_04
 Concept.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_04
 Simple.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_00
 Simple.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_04
 And you lean on this market.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_04
 Market is off remote controls.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_04
 You know it better.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_04
 It's very.

0:14:40	None
 Wow.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_04
 It's not an easy field to play, you know.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_04
 So be simple.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_04
 For personal preferences, I think that to make a baby proof remote control got to be a titanium.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_04
 It's a really good style.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_04
 It's going to look like this.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_04
 It is unbreakable and it is very universal.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_04
 We'll have a screen with a backlight.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_04
 We can change colors and we can put all the options into this screen.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_04
 We'll need only a few buttons.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_04
 All the other things can be controlled through the screen.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_04
 And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click because when you watch a movie and you want to change something, you always try to find a good button and click it.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_04
 But you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touching.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_04
 So.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_04
 Press.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_04
 I would propose this concept for design.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_04
 Just a few buttons.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_04
 A screen with a backlight which can change colors.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_04
 The titanium, I think and what else.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_04
 I got just very few good ideas.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_04
 We need power and volume.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_04
 And let us include two nice features into this device.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_04
 First, power on and off can be made fully automatic.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_04
 When you go to the sofa, take your control and point it to the TV.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_04
 The TV turns on.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_05
 When does it turn off?

0:16:37	SPEAKER_04
 When you don't touch the control but you go out of it for enough time.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_04
 Like you.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_05
 Sensing sensor machine.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_04
 That's a question to our technical designer, to engineers.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_04
 And another nice feature that I would like to implement is the volume control.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_04
 Suppose you set up some volume and then you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_04
 Like you want to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_04
 What do you want to do?

0:17:15	SPEAKER_04
 Something.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_04
 And then the volume changes.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_04
 It's easy to do.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_04
 You just control the.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_04
 According to your distance.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_05
 And the angle maybe if you have a stereo.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_05
 I'm not sure about the screen.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_05
 What is the usefulness of the screen?

0:17:32	SPEAKER_05
 Is it a touch screen by the way?

0:17:35	SPEAKER_04
 I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left right up down and enter.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_05
 So it gives instructions but it has to be the backlight somehow.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_04
 So its main purpose in fact is the backlight.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_04
 Which change colors which makes it easier to find.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_04
 And it can respond for your voice.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_04
 Like it can turn on the light for you just to find it easily.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_04
 So basically that's it.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_03
 I see that you target several applications not only TV but like we talk about universal remote control.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_04
 It can be easily done.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_04
 Because you got simple designs.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_04
 We should put it to simple actions.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_04
 Let it be universal.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_04
 So you want to use it for your high-fives system.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_04
 You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_04
 Just a few actions.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_04
 Few actions for everything.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_04
 Also rest we will put it into this menu on the screen.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_03
 Since we are targeting a really soon date for the issue of this remote control.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_03
 I think we will only concentrate on TV for the moment.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_03
 And maybe.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_04
 But it's quite universal.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_04
 You can just extend it to any device.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_05
 For instance if I want to go directly to channel 25.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_05
 How would I do that with this?

0:19:14	SPEAKER_05
 On 25.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_05
 Let's say I'm on channel 8 now.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_05
 You know these days we have hundreds of channels.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_05
 That's not so easy to go just next, next, next when you have hundreds of channels.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_04
 In fact I would propose another solution.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_04
 Basically you use just four or five channels.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_04
 Most people yeah.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_04
 So set up your TV set like channels that you use.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_04
 They are one, two, three and five.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_04
 And you will never have to go to a 25 channel.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_05
 In fact in one remote control that I've seen instead of doing that you could just say these are the channel 3, 28, 48 and 64 are those that I want to be cycled with my next button.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_05
 It's the same solution.

0:20:02	None
 Yeah.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_00
 But even we can have some LCD display that you can do.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_00
 You can do this with the five button the number and then go.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_05
 The thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to zap.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_05
 So even if they are only watching four or five channels I think they want to zap out of the 100 channels just because this is one kind of thing they do zap in.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_03
 And zap it's only next.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_03
 And it's only next.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_05
 So but you have to go to this button here.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_04
 Next, next.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_04
 Or say this can be back.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_00
 But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_00
 So it was two five they just press two and five and then.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we can make different modes for each button.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_03
 You can change mode zapping mode or.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_03
 Curant.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_00
 We were since we are focusing only on TV remote control.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_00
 So we can have more functions for TV.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_00
 If you want to go for universal then we have to limit for functions for each of our devices.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_04
 Could we carry out some research if you really need this?

0:21:15	SPEAKER_04
 Like how many people really need to go to channel number 25 and then to 64?

0:21:21	SPEAKER_05
 Oh I could have a look at that.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_05
 I'll check in my department if there's someone special is in them.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_05
 Although I don't know.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_04
 Thanks for your attention.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_03
 So now the technical aspects of this new device.

0:21:47	None
 Sorry.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_00
 I see you know I'm Mr. Ramaro.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_00
 I'm an expert in industrial design of all electronic devices.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_00
 I previously devised many like digital calculators and electronic calculators.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_00
 So now I briefly describe the working design of our remote control.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_00
 Well as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the device like TV or VCR or DVD player etc.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_00
 So we will have a portable device which will send message to the main device like TV.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_00
 So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions what we want on this portable device and usually these so to do these functions we need an interface.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_00
 It's basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that and then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will processed by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_00
 It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of sensor information.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_00
 Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_00
 So basically we need since we are focusing on our interface device that's our remote control we need few components mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like the keypad and new buttons we want and then we have some chip it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are involved doing mostly digital devices we have to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format and then we will have the infrared LED source which sends the information to the main device then we will have switch in our main device to do particular operations and we have to do different codes for different TVs so some TVs will have different encryption codes for doing channel changing and these things.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_03
 To make it quite a universal device.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah because people don't use one particular band so at least we have more than five brands which are really good so we need to check their specifications and do our encryption that's passing information to the TV device so we need to have particular encryption codes.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_00
 Then components so we have the main energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared source and then we have some inside some chip in the device since I don't have much time so I didn't put the connection to all these components and since I also want to know feedback from our marketing expert and user interface so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_03
 From the discussion we had can you make it on the whiteboard?

0:25:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah I'm sure because since our user interface engineers suggesting speech recognition and also marketing expert found that speech recognition is really handy so we can have another simple speech recognition on our DSP chip since we have some kind of energy this is our just normal battery so this battery once you switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put the small simple speech recognition and we can also try and this speech recognition for particular user so you just yeah such we just use simple to contract.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_00
 But very good to sell yeah even if you can find even a simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have this voice delers or they got all these young people who would

0:27:07	SPEAKER_05
 love to say that this remote control only works for them. You cannot use my remote control because it's targeted to me.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_03
 Whatever.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_03
 What about the price of this component?

0:27:19	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can make within five euros and even less than that because we want to have billions millions and in bulk so we can make really simple and we want to make really simple device because we have only very few words like like powers which on or some like then we will have something like this we'll have volume and then we'll have particular channel so users can.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_05
 So you will just be able to say please can you pop up the volume or it will be something like volume.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah up.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_00
 The user can use any kind of center but they should have this prompted words volume and

0:28:05	SPEAKER_03
 then. With keywords.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_00
 The volume decrease or increase so we try to only recognize both words and because we can't really say user to say same word and then it become more mechanical.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_00
 And then we can have channel they can say okay I want it because we don't know like users have different programs I mean they don't really follow same channel structure so we just want channel number we don't want like BBC or CNN or of course it has to be complicated.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_00
 So we'll have only this three main basic.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem it will be take care of our main.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_04
 No it's a conceptual question because now I see the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it volume up volume up.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_04
 But I think he's coming you know he's really annoyed with this.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_04
 Down up down.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_05
 First of all I think this is not a functionality that is going to be instead of using the buttons.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_05
 No not only speech.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_05
 It's on top of using the button.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_04
 Okay because it's budget like 12 euros.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_04
 Well I don't know.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_00
 Actually we can have one switch to like switch on and off this DSP processor and this really parallel to the suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power volume and this buttons and this DSPs again these two have some interaction like suppose people use DSP then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form like volume increase or like this key.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_00
 It need not be like very expensive because since we are only focusing on TV remote controls

0:29:50	SPEAKER_03
 and we have only few things here. Okay.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_04
 What you consider is a gesture recognition like if I want to put volume up I like to I take my remote control to do something like volume up and volume down.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_00
 At this point we didn't consider because it's very expensive.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_00
 It's very expensive because our target is only like 12.5 euros.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_03
 What about the idea of automatic on off on?

0:30:19	SPEAKER_00
 And what do you think?

0:30:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah even an automatic on off is also a bit problematic because it's different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really they just they don't touch the remote and you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off and should

0:30:37	SPEAKER_05
 we target the user personalize the remote control so in a given room there might be more than one remote control.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_05
 We would have each one.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah and with our own personal settings.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah that can be possible especially for power settings so user can say okay suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay after one hour.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_00
 Wouldn't that make a...

0:31:03	SPEAKER_03
 They can make arguments.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah of course.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_05
 I want to do the trick.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_05
 That's the problem we will sell more.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah we can have...

0:31:14	SPEAKER_02
 And we can increase this.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah exactly.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_02
 You can buy.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_02
 Well that's more.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah let's sell more.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_03
 Okay you have something else to say.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_00
 Ah not very much.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_03
 Okay thanks.

0:31:33	None
 Okay thanks.

0:31:34	None
 Thank you.

0:31:35	None
 So.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_02
 Can you just...

0:31:37	SPEAKER_02
 I love it.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah I think.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_02
 Okay we're just on time.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_03
 So we are now going to have the lunch break.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_03
 Great.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_03
 Then we will work again for 30 minutes in the video work.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_03
 Then we will meet again for the next meeting.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_03
 And in this one we want to be more focused on the individual actions.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_03
 No no.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_03
 On the components.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_03
 So you will focus on the component concept.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_03
 Of course the UID mark will be focused on the user interface concept and our market expert Sami Bencho on the train watching.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_03
 So of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal coach.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_03
 Oh I think that's all.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_03
 And we have maybe we have to say only for TV.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_03
 Not a red text.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_03
 I think automatic on off control it's not possible.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_00
 It's a current phrase.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah maybe in the next step if we make it work.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_00
 But speech recognizer can be possible.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah you can think about that.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_03
 And do you see something else?

0:33:44	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_04
 Should it be equipped with speakers?

0:33:58	SPEAKER_05
 Speakers.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_04
 Like you want to find it.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_03
 You shout.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_04
 And the answers I'm here.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_05
 It just beeps.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_05
 That would be a good fit.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_03
 Or maybe you want to find him.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, that's expensive.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_00
 Especially the power it really consumes because it should be all the time on.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_05
 I heard of devices where you just whistle them.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_05
 And because of the frequency they just answered to that.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_05
 You can't whistle.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_05
 Or a clap.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_05
 Clap.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_02
 Clap.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_05
 Clap is good.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_02
 I think.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_05
 It's a good fit.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_05
 We have only one hand.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's good.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_05
 He's another target.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_00
 But it's a good feature I guess we need to think about how to incorporate.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_04
 Just don't interfere with other devices.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_04
 Because always people do that their lights are turning on with clapping.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_05
 That already exists.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I thought it was my home.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, you do have.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_05
 Wow.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_03
 You're trendy.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_03
 So let's think about it.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_03
 I think that could be in the component concept.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_03
 Good.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you very much.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:35:36	None
 Thank you.
