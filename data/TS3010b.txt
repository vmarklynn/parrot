0:00:00	SPEAKER_00
 I see.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, it's so far, sir.

0:00:46	None
 Okay.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_01
 cybersecurity Videos

0:01:46	SPEAKER_03
 Okay so welcome back what do we have to do? First I want to say I'm the secretary so I'll make the minutes you find them in your in the map in the from the group just the minutes from the first meeting you'll find the next minutes also there then I want to hear from you what you've done and after that I have some new products requirements so and after that we have to make decisions what we will do and then we're ready we're 40 minutes for this meeting after that we have lunch so first I want to ask the industrial designer to tell what he did that's my job okay

0:03:05	SPEAKER_02
 I've saved it on my computer my presentation

0:03:30	SPEAKER_03
 but where what's the name what's the name of it

0:03:45	SPEAKER_02
 it was about the working of the remote control the technical function or the functional requirements working design but safe now I don't know where it is

0:04:24	SPEAKER_03
 and this is product documents

0:04:39	SPEAKER_02
 and I'm partitioned to desktop

0:04:48	SPEAKER_03
 up up up up up my jockens f

0:05:14	SPEAKER_02
 away and and I had one presentation.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_03
 Where can you study?

0:05:34	SPEAKER_02
 Open it.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, here it is.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_03
 Save as...not a cookie.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_02
 Mmm, desktop.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_03
 I'll check that.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_03
 Save.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_02
 Very good.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_02
 A little later, but here it is.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:06:01	None
 So...

0:06:08	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_02
 It's a little difficult when I'm going to tell you.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_02
 It's about the working of the remote control.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_02
 I just had an half an hour to study it and...

0:06:26	SPEAKER_02
 I don't get it.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_02
 There's 10 minutes to tell it.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_02
 10 minutes to tell it.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_02
 I think it will be a few minutes and...

0:06:33	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_02
 First, I will tell you something about the findings when I discovered about the remote control, the working of it.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_02
 Then I'll have some kind of map and it's the top of the remote control with a little bit of science.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_02
 I'll show it in a few minutes.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_02
 And then what I'll think about it.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_02
 First, the findings.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control is a very difficult thing to explain to just all of you who haven't seen the remote control inside.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_02
 There's a lot of plastic on it because it's not so expensive.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_02
 And there are a lot of wires which connect the components in it, the battery and switches and things like that.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_02
 There's a lot of small electronics, so it won't be too expensive to build it.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_02
 And the 12-year-of-50, I think, will make it.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_02
 And here I have the top of the remote control.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_02
 Here's some kind of chip.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_02
 On top of this are the numbers.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_02
 You have all of your remote control and the teletext button.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_02
 Here's the battery.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_02
 When you push the button, it will be sent to the chip.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_02
 And the chip will send it to all kind of sub-components.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_02
 That's what I said.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_02
 It's very difficult.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_02
 And after that, it will be sent to infrared.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_02
 And that will send it to your television.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_02
 That's a short how it works.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_02
 I think I can make it difficult, but we all don't get it.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_02
 My preference is it won't be...we shouldn't make it too big.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_02
 Also for the cost.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_02
 We should only put one battery on it, a long lasting battery.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_02
 Also for the cost.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_02
 Use only plastic, not other materials.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_02
 Also because of the cost.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_02
 Not too much buttons on it.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_02
 You can also make a menu button.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_02
 Then you will see it on a TV.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_02
 On a TV, you can switch into the menu.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's easier.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_02
 And the bleeps in you.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_02
 You told us.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_02
 But we can also use a bleep like something.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_02
 When the battery is empty, then there's a bleep.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_02
 You have to change it in a week or something.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_02
 And also the bleep, what I told you about when you lost it and you push your button, and then you were bleep bleep, and we will find it.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_02
 This is just...

0:09:38	SPEAKER_03
 Two questions. The battery.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_03
 You say one battery is cheaper.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_03
 Why?

0:09:45	SPEAKER_02
 If we use only just one small pen light, then it will be cheaper now.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_03
 When you use two, you can use it two times longer.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_02
 But then we have to make the remote control long-lasting.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_03
 So it's the size of the remote control?

0:10:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_03
 And the buttons.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_03
 When you use it on the television, you need the television which can use it.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_02
 But I think our remote control is for the television.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_02
 So we sell in our company, or is it also for other television?

0:10:32	SPEAKER_03
 I think we have to use it also on other television.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_02
 Then this is an option.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe just a menu button to use it on our television.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_02
 And we make it easier for our television and on the other television.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_02
 You can also use it, but then...

0:10:50	SPEAKER_03
 I think there are two different things.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_03
 We have to choose one.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_03
 That's to work on all television.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_02
 Then I think the menu button will only work on the newer televisions.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_02
 And we will look forward and don't make remote control, which is for all the televisions.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_02
 And I just have one more idea.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it's one of your tasks.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_02
 But to have a trendy remote control, we can also make something like the Nokia mobile phones to change covers.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_02
 So if you have a trendy house with all red, yellow and something, then you can put a red cover on it.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_02
 And also different things.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_00
 So we will just add to the cost.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_02
 Then it won't be... we will have just one cover on the original one.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_02
 And then you can buy the covers.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_00
 But you have to be able to change it to make it more difficult to design.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_02
 I think it will be a little more difficult, but not too much.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_02
 Just like with the Nokia mobile phones.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_03
 Much more Nokia telephones than these ones.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but then we will have to just put five covers on it and see if it works, if it won't work, then we will get something else.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_02
 And we won't go further with it.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_03
 Are the profits bigger than the cost?

0:12:28	SPEAKER_02
 A cover made in China, it won't be so expensive, I think.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_03
 But also design costs. I don't think when you have remote control, do you change the coffee?

0:12:44	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_02
 Would you change the coffee?

0:12:46	SPEAKER_02
 I won't.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_02
 But maybe I think trending people or children, when you're campaigned on it and the children say, Oh, this is my remote. So I made a picture on it.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_03
 I think that two less people would change it for good profit.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_02
 So, do you other people do you think about it?

0:13:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's a good idea, but if it will make profit enough.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 But it's an original idea.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, it is.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_03
 But I don't think we have to do it.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_02
 You're the project manager.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, that's it.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_03
 That's clear.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, thank you.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_03
 So now the user interface design.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_02
 Come on.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, well, I shall give a short talk about the technical function design.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_01
 I thought the technical function design was for a remote control to have some influence on the TV set, both audio and video in a cordless way, now cords attached.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_01
 And, well, by pushing a button on the remote.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 That was from my own experience and the previous meeting.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_01
 I find some interesting quotes on the web.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the same idea here.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_01
 Message to the television.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_01
 And, well, basic operations like on and off and switching channels and maybe a daily text or something like that.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_01
 Well, these are two remotes.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_01
 And that's our dilemma, I think.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_01
 We just heard from the industrial designer how difficult it is, but shall we make a basic remote control with just swap in channels and volume and power button and more functions on the remote.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe more devices you can influence radio or video recorder, VCR.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's our dilemma.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_01
 Any ideas about that?

0:15:36	SPEAKER_01
 Basic or multifunctional?

0:15:38	SPEAKER_03
 We'll go back on that later.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well, that was just on my mind.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't know what way we would go.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well, that was my functional talk.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, thank you.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_03
 Then your turn, the marketing is there.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay, this is a bit too far.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm going to have a presentation about the market, about what people think.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_00
 We did a usability lab test with vendors' persons and we looked at several things among them behind them, the design, did they like the use of it?

0:17:02	SPEAKER_00
 What's the stage in the ad while using remote controls?

0:17:06	SPEAKER_00
 Well, what will be our market?

0:17:09	SPEAKER_00
 And we asked them if we had some new features, if that would be a good idea or not.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_00
 Well, our findings.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_00
 Our users, they dislike to look and feel of current remote controls.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_00
 They especially found them very early and they also found them hard to learn how to use it.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_00
 Well, they also shape a lot, so shaping should be very easy.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_00
 And 50% of the users only use 10% of the business, so a lot of unused business.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_00
 There is more findings on the business, which business find users very important and with which not, and how much do they use them.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_00
 Well, the most used button is the channels selection and we asked them how relevant they think the business are, the power, volume and channel selections are very relevant.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_00
 Tail attacks is less relevant but also important.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_00
 Not important, they found the audio, it's not the volume but specific, the pitch or the left or right.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_00
 The screen and the brightness and channel settings, and they also are not used very often.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_00
 Then we have a few graphs about the market.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_00
 Here we can see what the market share is of several groups.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_00
 As you can see, most users are between 36 and 45.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_00
 The younger group between 6 and 25 is not very big.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_00
 To come back on the swapping things, I don't think the younger will be most interested in it, but they are not a very big group.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_00
 In the area we asked them how would you like a new feature if you have an LCD on the remote control?

0:19:24	SPEAKER_00
 What would you think of it?

0:19:25	SPEAKER_00
 You can clearly see young users say, hey, they will be very nice and all the users think they are scared of change, they won't like it.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_00
 Another thing, how would you like to have a speech recognition on it?

0:19:43	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we see the same young users think that's an interesting idea and all users not.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_00
 We found out that there are two several markers at which we can aim.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_00
 The first are the younger, the age between 16 and 45.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_00
 They are interested in the features, as you can see here.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_00
 There are more critical on their money spending.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_00
 The second group is the older group, the age between 46 and 65.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_00
 They are less interested in new features, but they spend their money more easily.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_00
 Now, if you look back at this graph, we can see that among the first group is about 60% and the second group about 40%.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_00
 So the first group is bigger.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_00
 Then I come to my personal preferences.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_00
 The first question is also we have to ask is at which mark do we aim at?

0:20:54	SPEAKER_00
 Of course, saying we aim at a young group doesn't say that all people won't buy it, but less of them will buy it.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I fact even young people say it's hard to use remote control.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_00
 So if you make a remote control that is very easy to use, especially in the test group, even the young group will also be more interested.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_00
 We can make special features, but I think it looks nice in the first time.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_00
 But when you use it, I don't know what's a good thing of speech recognition.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that's my second point.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_00
 Less important functions should be described from the remote control.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_00
 This is about the discussion we had earlier.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_00
 You can find most functions on the FE set.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_00
 You don't have to have a lot of audio options or screen options to change the brightness and those things.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_00
 Well, the design is very important.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_00
 One thing I didn't say I think is that a lot of users also said that I would buy a good looking remote control if there would be one, but they found most remote controls very early.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_00
 So the design of our remote control is very important.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_00
 It should be very self-friendly as most users use it for that.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_00
 That were my findings.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, thank you.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_02
 One question, if we aim for the younger people, and there will be a lot of features like LCD or the speech recognising, the cost will be a lot higher.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_02
 I think we don't have that in our budget.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_01
 Do you think?

0:22:59	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think 25 euros for a remote is really cheap or something.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_01
 It's hard to get the younger.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_03
 I think LCD is cheaper than speech recognitions.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_03
 I think that can be a good option.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_03
 LCD, just LCD.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_03
 Only the LCD.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_03
 But we'll get back on that.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_03
 Now.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, good.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_03
 What to do?

0:23:46	SPEAKER_03
 We'll go back on the decisions later.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_03
 Now, we have a few new product requirements.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_03
 First, teletext.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_03
 We have internet now, so we don't need the teletext anymore.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_03
 So, not necessary.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_03
 Next, only for the television, so we don't look at other things like the radio or something.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_03
 Only the television.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_03
 Third.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_03
 We look at the 8th group of 40 plus.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_03
 Now, younger than 40.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_03
 Big group, and like you showed, not very much people buy our stuff.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_03
 Fourth point, our corporate color and slogan must be used.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_03
 Very important for the design.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_03
 So, you can see it on our side.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_03
 Next.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_03
 We have to make our decisions what we want to do.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_03
 So, like you said, we need the 8th guy.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it's good to put it in a document.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_03
 We have to decide what controls do we need.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_03
 So, maybe you can tell us.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can first have a discussion on the product requirements you just said.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_00
 The requirements you just said.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, maybe you should first have a discussion about that.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, I personally think teletext is a good option.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_00
 Not everyone who's looking to speak can go to the internet when they want to see the latest news.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_03
 But we don't use it.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_03
 It's not my requirements.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_02
 We'll just have to do that.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_02
 We have to do this.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, no discussion about it.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_03
 So, what controls do we need?

0:26:28	SPEAKER_03
 We'll first.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_03
 Power button.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_03
 Power.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_01
 I think separate channels.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, channel.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_01
 But then both the separate channels.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_01
 So, zero to nine or something.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_03
 Zero to nine.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_03
 It's easy to pick what was your one.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_03
 We have.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_03
 Where was that example?

0:27:50	SPEAKER_03
 Hello.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_03
 What do we need?

0:28:00	SPEAKER_02
 All of zero to nine.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_00
 To change to the next channel, just one button to move up, move down.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's the channel.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_03
 Do we make menu?

0:28:19	SPEAKER_03
 Menu.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_03
 Here's the new data efficient.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_03
 I think the only one or two numbers.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_03
 And that's it.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_00
 I think it will be quite useful for Avos, up down for channel selection, left, right for volume, and a menu button.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_00
 And if you press the menu button, you get into the menu and you can use the same buttons, but to tend to scroll to the menu and change options on the LCD screen.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_00
 You mean?

0:29:22	SPEAKER_00
 Well, yeah, that depends on if you have the menu on the TV, or you get the menu on the LCD screen on the remote control.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's better to have it on the remote control.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_03
 Because it has to work on all television.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_03
 So, yes.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_02
 But then we'll come to the cast.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_03
 But if we have this.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_00
 But if we aim at the younger market, as we've seen in the usability lab, they will buy a nice-looking remote control.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_00
 And also to find the easy-to-use part, very important.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_00
 So if you have LCD screen and not too many buttons, I think that will increase even when it's a bit more cost to still sell.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_03
 So now we don't have a lot of buttons.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_03
 Is this enough?

0:30:35	SPEAKER_03
 Mute.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_03
 Mute.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe in the menu.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but then it's always more than one.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_03
 I think it will.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe more.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_03
 Well, then that's all.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_03
 This will be the buttons.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's enough for the next phase.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_03
 So you can go on to.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_02
 But now we have only the buttons.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_02
 We don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_03
 No, that's for the next phase.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_03
 If we check.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_03
 Phase two is the conceptual design.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_03
 So then we will have the concepts.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_03
 So next point.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_03
 Now we have lunch break.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_03
 After that we have 30 minutes for work.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_03
 And you can find the minutes in the product document for the inclusive buttons.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_03
 In the video action you can find them in the email.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_03
 So now it's time for lunch.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_02
