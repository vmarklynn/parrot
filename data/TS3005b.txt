 Hello.

0:00:01	None
 Good morning.

0:00:02	None
 Again.

0:00:03	None
 Again.

0:00:04	None
 Again.

0:00:11	SPEAKER_00
 Again.

0:00:18	SPEAKER_02
 Good morning.

0:00:25	None
 Again.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_03
 One question.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:01:01	None
 Submit.

0:01:04	None
 Okay.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_00
 All sets.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see what we can find here.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_00
 I'm very warm welcome again to everyone.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_00
 Here we are already in our functional design meeting.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_00
 And this is what we are going to do.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_00
 The opening, which we are doing now.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_00
 And the special note, I'm project manager, but on the meetings, I'm also the secretary, which means I will make minutes as I did as a previous meeting.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_00
 And I'll also put these as fast as possible in the project requirements.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_00
 And then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_00
 And we have some more time, 40 minutes, but I think we will need it.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I don't know who wants to go first with this presentation.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_04
 Should I go first with the user?

0:02:39	SPEAKER_01
 I see.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_00
 And one question, your name, Denny, is it with a AEA?

0:02:52	SPEAKER_00
 AEA.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_03
 I wanted to explain the work and design of a remote control.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_03
 It's possibly very handy if you want to design one of those.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it basically works as I wrote down in this little summary.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_03
 When you press a button, that's when you do, for example, when you want to turn up the volume, a little connection is made.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_03
 The rubber button just presses on a little pin plate, which makes a connection that gives the chips, which is mounted beneath those, that plastic of a rubber button, sends that connection has been made and knows what button you press, for example, the volume up or volume down button.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_03
 The chip makes Morse code like signal, which then is signaled to several transistors.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_03
 Which sends the signal to a little lat.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_03
 You know what a lat is?

0:04:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_03
 And that makes the infrared light signal, which is sent to the television set, which has a sensor in it to send the signal of the infrared.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_03
 And it's basically how it works.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_03
 The findings that I found searching up some detail information about remote controls are that they are very easy to produce.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_03
 This piece is possible to make them a mass production because it is as easy as printing a page, just a fiberglass plate.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_03
 It's covered with some coatings and chips.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_03
 And the technology is already available.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have to find out how remote controls have to work or how to make some chips that are possible to transmit those signals.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_03
 I made a little animation about how remote control works.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_04
 Innovation.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_01
 There is something turning.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's a little bug.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_00
 It's in the smartboard.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the subcomponent, I suppose, that you understand what the subcomponent is.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_03
 In this example, it's the button.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_03
 When it is pressed down, the switch is switched on.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_03
 So, with the wire, it's sent to the chip in cooperation with the battery, of course, because to make a signal possible, you have to have some sort of electronic infrared light.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yes?

0:06:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_03
 After it's being composed by the chip, the signal is transported to the infrared bulb.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_03
 And from there, it signals a Morse code-like signal to the bulb in the television set.

0:06:22	None
 Okay.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_03
 I wrote down some personal preferences about the remote control.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, it is very handy if the remote control is handheld, so you don't have to wind it up or something.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_03
 It's very light to use it.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_03
 I personally prefer that it would become available in various colors.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_03
 And easy to use buttons, but I suppose that one of the other team members thought of that too.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_03
 And it is possible for several designs.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_03
 And easy to use buttons.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_03
 Perhaps soft touch, touch screen buttons, because the rubber buttons are always...

0:07:11	SPEAKER_03
 They can be slightly damaged, so the numbers on the buttons are not possible to read anymore.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_03
 And, well, as I said before, we can make several designs.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that's my contribution to this meeting.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_00
 This meeting.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_00
 Can I go next?

0:07:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yep.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_02
 Please.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:07:33	None
 So...

0:07:35	SPEAKER_02
 Spoke it.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_01
 Well, my name is Imklyong, and I looked at the technical functions design of the remote.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_01
 I did this by looking at examples of other remote controls, how they look, and information from the web that I found.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_01
 What I found was that the actual use of remote control is to send messages to the video set, how you...

0:08:04	SPEAKER_01
 What you described just early.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_01
 And it can be all sorts of messages, turn it on, turn it off, change the channel, just volume, that kind of thing.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_01
 Play video text, but also play CD if you use your CD player, the remote controller.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_01
 That one.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_01
 There are some examples of remote controls. You can see they are very different.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_01
 The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need in a lot of buttons, et cetera.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_01
 And the other is more user-friendly, the little, it's big buttons, and not all the stuff you can do with it, but the essential stuff is there.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_01
 I guess you could better... you should look at a user-centered approach, because the customers have to use them, and if they don't think it's usable, they won't buy it.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_01
 A lot of buttons they may think from, I don't meet as much as that.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_01
 Well, personal preferences is a simple remote with the basic functions that you can need that you could use, and keep in mind the new functions of TV, what we discussed earlier, split screen, and is that a function that you should have, because all the TVs will have them, or because of only a few, and isn't really necessary.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 And then make it, I would make so that you could use it on more than one appliance.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_01
 If you have one that does the video, it could also work with the stereo, because play is play and stop, stop, and let's think.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_01
 You could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for anything.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_01
 And it should be user-friendly, clear buttons, and not too much.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_01
 And that's just my presentation.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, good.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so, we're going to discuss the functional requirements of the remote.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_04
 That means that functions users want to have on the remote control, or just, yeah, the users actually.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_04
 The method I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we're going to focus on more.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_04
 Are the younger people going to buy remote control, or the elderly people?

0:10:51	SPEAKER_04
 And that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_04
 Some data.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_04
 Younger people from 16 to 45 years are more interested in features like LCD screens, speech recognition, etc.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_04
 And we possess about two-thirds of the market from in that range of age.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_04
 The elderly people from 45 years to 65 years are not that much interested in features, and we possess less than two-thirds.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_04
 And that's two-fifth of the market share in that area.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, findings.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_04
 50% of the users lose their remotes often.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_04
 So we don't have to make it very small, like a mobile phone or something, but somewhat bigger than small, so you don't lose it that much anymore.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_04
 So 75% of the users also find it ugly, and 75% of users save a lot.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_04
 So the buttons should be that small or should be that complex because you have to search for the buttons, which one you're going to use.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_04
 Next.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_04
 Important issues about the remote.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_04
 I think it would be better with the personal reference, but okay.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_04
 Remote control has to have a low power usage because 75% of the users only save one time an hour, so the power usage is also one time an hour, so with a high power usage we would use a lot of batteries.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_04
 The following buttons and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control, so those have to be find very easily and have to be somewhat like bigger, etc.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_04
 It has also to have to find easily when the label is gone.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_04
 My colleague also announced that that label should be scratched off or who is off the slate.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_04
 So if that's the problem, you also have to find it easily on the remote.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_04
 Buttons, like what our colleague said, have to be minimalized or should be covered or in the LCD screen.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_04
 The LCD screen is easy because you have the LCD screen.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_04
 You have the first options, put one option, and then you have all the buttons of that option, so the other options will be gone and you don't see the buttons.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_04
 So LCD screen should be easy, but an LCD screen, the problem with the LCD screen is that elderly people from 45 to 65 years don't use the LCD screen.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_04
 So we have to keep that in mind that if you're going to implement the LCD screen, you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_03
 LCD screen as in touch screen?

0:13:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, touch screen.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_04
 The last but not least, younger people are more critical about the features because they use the remote control often more often and are more technical than all the people.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_04
 And all the people spend more money and easily on the remote control.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_04
 So we have to keep in mind to focus not a lot, not that much on the younger people, but also somewhat on the elderly people.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_04
 And on my personal references, I don't have any more time to come with that, but like I said, LCD screen is easily to use because you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_04
 And it should be used to use, especially the following buttons, the channel buttons and the number buttons to step through the channels.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_04
 And that is it.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_00
 Well, thank you all.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_00
 Did everyone receive an email with the new project requirements?

0:14:57	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_01
 I did not.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_01
 Perhaps there is.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_00
 And then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them so you can all read them.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, well, not in this presentation.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_00
 It should be in there.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I can tell you them from my laptop.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_00
 The data text has become outdated since the popularity of the Internet.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_00
 So that's the first thing we should pay less attention to the data text.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_00
 Remote control should only be used for the television, otherwise the project becomes more complex, which endangers the time to market.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_00
 And of course, we'll make it more costly, I think.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_00
 Our current customers are within the age group of 40 plus.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_00
 New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than 40.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_00
 And you talked about that before.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_00
 And a last point, but also very important, our corporate image should stay recognizable in our products, which means that our corporate color and slogan must be implemented in the new design.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to keep that in mind.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_00
 Well, according to our agenda, it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_00
 So who has any idea what should be on it and what shouldn't?

0:16:14	SPEAKER_01
 You said it should only be used with one appliance or with one, only the TV.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, only a view for television.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_01
 And the video also, or not.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_00
 It's only for television here.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_00
 Makes it a lot easier.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_04
 So yeah, then you can, yeah, requirements, no, functions.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_01
 Then it should have on off.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, stand by.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_04
 Basics, stand by a volume channel, 1 till 2, 0 numbers on it.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_04
 The TV text doesn't have to be.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_04
 Other functions.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I can hear you can change from 1 number to 2.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_01
 I know.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's easy to implement the button with a special, which especially do that because some TVs, if you press the 1 and then the 2.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_04
 It makes it be between 5 seconds, you make 12.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_04
 And that's relaxed.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_03
 And there are some models that don't accommodate that function.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_03
 So the Philips Television makes plus 1 and that indeed to press 1 and then 2 to make a G2 to reach gem 12.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_03
 But all the television makes use of those buttons.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_03
 Where you first press that button and then press 2 digits to...

0:17:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so you tap that one.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I'll make targets.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_04
 HR?

0:17:41	SPEAKER_04
 We're 45 plus or so.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_00
 Well, new products should reach your market with customers that are younger than 40.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_04
 How will we have?

0:17:51	SPEAKER_04
 Because younger people have now 16 to 25 age or 81% interest in LCD screen from 26 to 35, 66% and 36 to 45, 55%.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_04
 So I think because most print plate will be broken in about 2 years, you have to press very hard to go to the next channel with the LCD screen.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_04
 It's easy because you only have to wipe the screen for a fingerprint.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_03
 And then you can use that.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_03
 That collides with our mission to make it very cheap.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_03
 Because LCD screens are very expensive.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_03
 Touch screen.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_03
 Probably even more.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_03
 True.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_03
 True.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's possible to make an LCD screen.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_03
 How was the information?

0:18:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it only says that this percentage like LCD screen, because it says that younger age between 16 and 45 highly interested features more critical.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_03
 Perhaps we should focus on the LCD screen.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because our target is 16 to 45.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but will we not exceed our reduction cost?

0:19:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, you don't know how much cost LCD screen is it possible to find out?

0:19:20	SPEAKER_04
 I don't have any costs here.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_04
 I only have percentages.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_01
 What if you do an LCD, do we have any buttons?

0:19:34	SPEAKER_03
 An LCD screen is just like a drone here.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_03
 It displays several buttons.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_03
 For example, if you want the minimal used buttons such as channel and volume, it displays 4 buttons on the screen.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_03
 And it's possible to press them down, just like a touchscreen.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_01
 So you can adjust which buttons you want on them.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, you can adjust for example, adjust the audio settings, press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_04
 So the other buttons are gone.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_00
 So we're going for an LCD screen?

0:20:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's the most useful thing.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_00
 And I'm hoping that when we produce a lot, it won't be too expensive.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_01
 We had 1250, I guess?

0:20:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, 1250?

0:20:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I don't know how expensive.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 Any guesses?

0:20:23	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I suppose if the young people are interested in LCD screens, we surely make them.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_03
 And if that is our market share, our goal to deliver those remotely.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_01
 You also said that we should not only focus on the younger people, but also the older.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but...

0:20:46	SPEAKER_01
 Will they use it if it's only as an LCD screen?

0:20:48	SPEAKER_04
 It's 46 to 45, 33% and 56 to 65 to 12%.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_04
 But our project requirements are the new products will be reached for new markets with customers that are younger than 40.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_01
 But you don't want to eliminate the other ones?

0:21:05	SPEAKER_04
 No, they're not now.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_01
 But if they also buy them, that's all right.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but market share for 40 years and younger is higher than 65 in younger.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so LCD it is?

0:21:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, let's try to...

0:21:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, if it gets too much to expensive, then we should be sticking to rubber buttons.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think that they will send you some information about the cost of LCD.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_04
 No costs at all.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_03
 So if you receive an email about that, can you post it in our project map?

0:21:49	SPEAKER_04
 I think that should... I think we all get the costs of everything.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_03
 Because you are the marketing expert.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_04
 I'll post it.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_01
 I figured out the backup plan that we would use.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_01
 Sure, sure.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, but for now, LCD.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_04
 Then you have 75% of use finding it ugly.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_01
 LCD?

0:22:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_04
 And 80% of the users would spend more money with it when a remote would look fancy.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, this is a problem.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_04
 It'll fancy with the LCD screen.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but they don't like it.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_01
 They think it's ugly when it has an LCD.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, just the play remotes, not specific LCD remotes.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_01
 All right, that's all the new setup.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, maybe you can make something fancy out of an LCD remote because it's new as far as I know.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, of course.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_04
 And then you have the other thing that's 75% sep a lot, but that's not a question with the LCD screen.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_04
 The only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off of one of these in time to get all your fingerprints off of it.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, what else does a remote need?

0:22:57	SPEAKER_00
 A mute button.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_00
 Mute button.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_00
 Mm-hmm.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_04
 I think.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_04
 The most important thing on the remote control are channel selection, volume selection, and power usage.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_04
 And the Taylor text, but that is not of the question.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_04
 Other things are...

0:23:17	SPEAKER_01
 I think you put a button of Taylor text for people who want to use it.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it would be.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I've got a big remote.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_00
 I'd have to fill it.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and we could make a separate menu on the LCD.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_04
 And also less important things are screen settings, audio settings, and channel settings.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, less important, because I think they should be there.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it should be there, but not...

0:23:41	SPEAKER_03
 But in a sub-press menu.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sub-menu.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's also important to make possible to...

0:23:48	SPEAKER_03
 Anycon in English?

0:23:50	SPEAKER_03
 And to not use batteries and use...

0:23:54	SPEAKER_03
 But...

0:23:55	SPEAKER_03
...acry batteries to...

0:23:57	SPEAKER_02
 I would be very proud.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sure.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so you can mount the...

0:24:03	SPEAKER_03
...the remote control to charge it.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_01
 We should think of it 1250.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but we don't...

0:24:11	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know why it says...

0:24:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so...

0:24:13	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, because when you get an LCD screen, you run it on batteries.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_01
 The batteries will be...

0:24:18	SPEAKER_01
...the very...

0:24:19	SPEAKER_01
...the...

0:24:20	SPEAKER_01
...the...

0:24:21	SPEAKER_01
...the...

0:24:22	SPEAKER_01
...the...

0:24:23	SPEAKER_01
...the...

0:24:24	SPEAKER_01
...the...

0:24:25	SPEAKER_03
...the...

0:24:26	SPEAKER_01
...the...

0:24:27	SPEAKER_01
...the...

0:24:28	SPEAKER_01
...very extra that you have...

0:24:30	SPEAKER_01
...first you turn the remote on and then you can...

0:24:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think it's not that easy...

0:24:36	SPEAKER_04
...because I don't think people like it, who...

0:24:39	SPEAKER_04
...that you have to turn it on first, and then use it.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's better when the TV shuts down or remote shuts down.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_04
...and goats turn...

0:24:48	SPEAKER_01
...by my window, you know, so...

0:24:50	SPEAKER_01
... Yeah, automatically.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, and...

0:24:53	SPEAKER_03
...off the message...

0:24:54	SPEAKER_00
...and...

0:24:56	SPEAKER_00
...and maybe a low battery indicator.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_00
 low battery indicator. Yeah, on the screen. Sure.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_04
 Then, before or hour, when it gets empty, then you have plenty of time to recharge it, or put it in a recharger. So we are going for the recharger.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's slim.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_04
 Is it sensible? Yeah, because when you're watching TV, you have to put it in a recharger.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_03
 When you're done with...

0:25:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, okay, but we have to be sure that the batteries go hour, six hours, five, six hours.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_01
 You also forget to put it in.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you probably.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_03
 But you also forget to buy batteries.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_03
 You can't use it.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_04
 Or you have to be sure that the batteries lost a couple of days with the rechargers.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_01
 So I think the battery should work a lot longer than a couple of days.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because I have LCD screen.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's your...

0:25:58	SPEAKER_04
 High power usage.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_03
 High power usage, so it should be a standard move to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_03
 That's also a great advantage because you can't lose it anymore.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_03
 You are obliged to put it in the charger and not to leave any couch between some cushions.

0:26:20	None
 Yeah.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, we had a point there.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_01
 But then you also have to have somewhere where you can put a recharger near your couch.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_01
 Because otherwise you have to...

0:26:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, otherwise.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_01
...you have to walk a lot and we're going to have to turn on the TV.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_01
 Just a small device.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_01
 I think everything has to be...

0:26:38	SPEAKER_04
...like a telephone charger or something.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_03
 And just the cable or even the charger when you can mount it on.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, something like that.

0:26:47	None
 Yeah.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it has to be easy to use also.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_04
...for the...

0:26:56	SPEAKER_04
...market share, speech recognition.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_03
 I see.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_03
 For the original designs, for the otherly, you could make it possible to enlarge the screen.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_03
 To make it possible to not display a button at 10 points.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_04
 I think that this will be standard.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but it is a bunch of functions you have to specify.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_03
 Because we can look at perhaps 40 buttons at the screen, but in the otherly, only look at two buttons.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_03
 And if you can tell me about speech recognition?

0:27:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it says...

0:27:34	SPEAKER_03
...speech recognition.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_03
 12...

0:27:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, 12 or 50.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_04
 That's also 91% 60 to 25, 26 to 35 years, 76% and 36 to 45, 35 percent.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's quite a bit.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_00
 It's pretty...

0:27:50	SPEAKER_00
...but I...

0:27:51	SPEAKER_01
...I...

0:27:52	SPEAKER_01
...if I make a name for LCD.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_03
 Let's do speech.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_03
 Let's leave out all the remote controls and just put a microphone on top of the telephone.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_03
 You can snap for something.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_03
 Turn volume up.

0:28:04	None
 Yeah.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_03
 Hey.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_03
 That's my idea.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_03
 It's really low.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_01
 You say the wrong thing.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_03
 It has to be remote control now.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_01
 But they want to talk into the remote control or something?

0:28:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, why not?

0:28:19	SPEAKER_04
 It's not to pay more for speech recognition in the remote control.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_04
 So everything it says.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_01
 Do we want to implement that?

0:28:27	SPEAKER_04
 I think the LCD screen should be sufficient.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_00
 But when you look at percentages...

0:28:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it says a lot.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_03
 Perhaps the option should be...

0:28:38	SPEAKER_00
 Of course, even higher.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_03
 Why not?

0:28:41	SPEAKER_00
 Why not?

0:28:42	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe because of the cost, but nobody knows how much.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's better to have LCD screen because in the area of 36 to 45, we have about 30% of the market sharing in our hands.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_04
 And 55 of those people want LCD screen and 35 on speech recognition.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_04
 So I think it's better to keep it with LCD screen.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_00
 But would it be useful to implement both?

0:29:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, with the costs allowed.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if it can be done with the cost of 12.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_04
 If it should be done, if it could be done, it should be better.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_01
 But how would you like to implement that, that you say, volume up and then those are...

0:29:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_03
 Certain systems already exist, I think.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_01
 Then you also have to have different languages.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_01
 If we go international...

0:29:34	SPEAKER_01
 It's true.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_01
 It's used to do French and Russian English.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_04
 It should be also coming with some software.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_04
 It should be also with LCD screen because I think it's different written volumes with different written than...

0:29:46	SPEAKER_04
 So I'll heal you or something.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_01
 You can use icons for the speaker and the...

0:29:53	SPEAKER_01
 That's better than language.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_01
 So you want to...

0:29:59	SPEAKER_03
 It's international...

0:30:01	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_04
 What else?

0:30:04	SPEAKER_00
 So no speech recognition.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if it could be done with...

0:30:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_03
 It should be done.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_00
 It could be done with...

0:30:12	SPEAKER_00
 And then with different languages.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that should be...

0:30:16	SPEAKER_03
 That's not so difficult.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_03
 I already used several voice-operated systems and they are all possible to...

0:30:24	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, but...

0:30:26	SPEAKER_01
 That's difficult.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_01
 You should suggest, I think.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_04
 Every language of dialects.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's very difficult.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_01
 You have to speak so that it can understand.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_04
 I think it can be implemented, but maybe...

0:30:40	SPEAKER_01
 You could use that as an option.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, an option, yes.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_04
 Money left or something.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_04
 50 euro cents.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_01
 That's two speeches.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_03
 Speech recognition.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_00
 So we only do it when we have enough money left.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I've written down an honor off button.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_00
 Volume selection, channel selection, digits from 1 to 0.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_00
 Or from 0 to 9.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_00
 A digit button to switch between 1 and 2 digits.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_00
 A mute button.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_00
 A separate menu for a teletext.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_00
 A battery indicator.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to use a docking station.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_00
 And probably LCD.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_00
 And if there's enough money, speech recognition.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_00
 And the possibility to enlarge buttons or to have large buttons.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_01
 A teletext.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_01
 It wasn't really important.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_01
 You also now have colors.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if we should implement that.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_01
 When you press the red button, you go to page 102 and we press the...

0:31:46	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if we should implement that.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_01
 Because it says that teletext is not really important.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_01
 Short cuts.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_04
 I'll take which we could also implement the audio settings, screen settings, and channel settings, but as sub menus.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_04
 If you turn the remote control on, you have to see 1 to 0 channel volume.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_04
 And if you want to use the teletext screen or audio, then you can press it.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_04
 It should be available, but not directly available.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:18	None
 Okay.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_00
 So not too much the teletext support, but in a separate menu.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_01
 So actually, it is there.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but it's not ready there.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_03
 So there's a lot of confuses.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_03
 It has to be easy to use.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_03
 A surge.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_03
 If you want to use teletext, you can press the teletext button and then the options become available.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_04
 The side of it.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_00
 But no more buttons or functions.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_00
 Oh.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_00
 What else can you do with that?

0:32:49	SPEAKER_00
 Are we forgetting something?

0:32:51	SPEAKER_01
 I've got two examples here, but I don't think there's anything we should...

0:32:56	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think we should play a boss.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_04
 We don't have a video on this.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_04
 Where is your presentation?

0:33:04	SPEAKER_04
 You could check the other remote controls, technical functions.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_01
 Hey, you could click here.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, which was?

0:33:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_01
 Technical function.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_01
 There a bit more.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_01
 You could shoot stretch them because...

0:33:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_04
 Technical function is...

0:33:23	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_01
 I guess we've got them all.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_04
 I've got what you have for me.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_04
 This is actually what you're doing.

0:33:32	None
 Yeah.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_04
 Zoom buttons.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_01
 White screen.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_01
 White screen.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_04
 High screen.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_04
 Different things.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_04
 I'll let you put them on now.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_01
 Different.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_01
 With that should also be a sub-menu.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_04
 It should be available by that.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_04
 It's a screen setting or something.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_01
 We should also implement some screen settings.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, screen settings, audio settings.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_04
 The analytics settings you have.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_04
 General settings.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_01
 So you can probably...

0:34:02	SPEAKER_01
 So those four and of course the main.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_01
 So first you see the main and the other ones you can go to...

0:34:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_04
 Like depth screens or something or...

0:34:10	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_01
 I hope we can do this.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, it's depending on what kind of television you got.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_03
 Because if you don't got a white screen television, you don't need to...

0:34:20	SPEAKER_04
 You don't need to use it.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_04
 You don't use it.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_03
 And if the television does not support such operations...

0:34:27	SPEAKER_01
 You don't have to use that tab.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_04
 So you leave it.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_04
 Hello.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_04
 Or it could be possible to have a standard version of the remote.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_04
 Expendous version.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_01
 And do we want to have different colors?

0:34:41	SPEAKER_01
 Or...

0:34:42	None
 Colors.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_01
 Colors.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_03
 Colors I think the main color of the remote control is the color of the LCD screen.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_03
 Because we don't want to love...

0:34:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_03
 It divides itself.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_04
 It divides itself.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_04
 How many percent?

0:34:55	SPEAKER_04
 80 percent.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's ugly.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_04
 We'll spend more money if it looks fancy.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_03
 So use a lot of people...

0:35:02	SPEAKER_01
 Perhaps you can make adjustable front.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_01
 Like with the...

0:35:05	SPEAKER_01
 Adjustable front.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_01
 You can...

0:35:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_01
 You can...

0:35:09	SPEAKER_01
 So you're...

0:35:10	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's...

0:35:11	SPEAKER_03
 Well, make it a little bit different colors.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_03
 Red, white, blue.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_03
 Black.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_03
 And a sea crew.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_00
 She's two fursions.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_00
 Same since versions.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_03
 And she press a button.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_04
 It turns green.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_04
 Oh.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_04
 Leave.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_02
 Five minutes.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_00
 Single for final five minutes.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_00
 So I have the things I just read.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_00
 Then we have separate menus for data text, screen settings, audio settings.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_00
 And well.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_04
 Channel settings.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_01
 So you can program that to you.

0:35:48	None
 Okay.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_00
 Hmm.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_00
 Perhaps you should...

0:35:51	SPEAKER_01
 You'll throw them in one pile.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_01
 So options.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_01
 And then you set them.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:58	SPEAKER_01
 Otherwise you have all those data text.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_01
 Perhaps they'll text not...

0:36:01	SPEAKER_04
 Or like...

0:36:02	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, for menu button.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_00
 Also a separate menu.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_04
 Or also for menu button.

0:36:06	SPEAKER_04
 First menu.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_04
 Then you have main...

0:36:08	SPEAKER_04
 Main usage.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_04
 All the settings.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_00
 But we can work it out later.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_00
 So we're having a general menu with the most used functions.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_00
 Data text, screen settings, audio settings, channel settings.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_00
 And maybe there are options for the remote itself.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_00
 Like large icons or small icons.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_00
 Uh, what else?

0:36:29	SPEAKER_04
 I think.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_04
 Because we don't have a lot of buttons on the one screen.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_04
 I think the buttons...

0:36:34	SPEAKER_04
 We don't have any buttons.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but...

0:36:36	SPEAKER_04
 That's right.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_04
 We only have a general button, a volume button.

0:36:39	SPEAKER_04
 Those buttons.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_04
 There's also a new LCD, right?

0:36:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_01
 So we don't have any normal buttons on the one screen.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, normal buttons.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe only the...

0:36:49	SPEAKER_00
 We don't have buttons.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_00
 We don't have any normal buttons on the one screen.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe only the...

0:36:54	SPEAKER_00
 We don't have any normal buttons on the one screen.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, well, you should be able to set which TV you have.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_01
 If you want to set it.

0:37:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sure.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_03
 Of course you need the settings button or settings option for the remote control.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_01
 But it's an idea to use what you set, a normal on-and-off button for the TV.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, no, no.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_04
 Because we discussed that you could charge it otherwise it...

0:37:19	SPEAKER_04
 It jumps to standby mode.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but not for the remote, but for the TV.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the TV, of course.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_04
 I think that's the best thing is to implement that one in the menu with the volume.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_01
 But not as normal button in the USB.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:37:34	SPEAKER_00
 Well, maybe there should be a separate button apart from the LCD because you can't turn it on when the LCD is off.

0:37:39	SPEAKER_00
 So how do you turn the thing on there?

0:37:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, we are.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_00
 You just tap it.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_00
 Tap it.

0:37:45	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_00
 And then the television is on also or just to remote?

0:37:49	SPEAKER_00
 No, just to remote.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_04
 The television doesn't have to be on.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_04
 That's where you can press on standby mode.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, standby, then press on the remote, press on and then TV should be...

0:37:58	SPEAKER_01
 Affainable.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know whether it's handy to have a normal on-button.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_01
 Just to wrap our TV so you can turn it on and then you can choose channel.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_01
 Otherwise you... I don't know whether or not that's...

0:38:12	SPEAKER_03
 A normal button on the remote control?

0:38:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, no, no, no. To turn it on.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_01
 Or you should put it in the LCD screen.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because when you touch the LCD screen when it is in standby mode, it should pop on.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_03
 Why would it be handy to have a normal button?

0:38:32	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I guess if you use the LCD screen, you first have search where it's the on-button and you...

0:38:38	SPEAKER_01
 You then turn and then the TV goes on.

0:38:40	SPEAKER_01
 But if you have a normal on-button on the remote, then you do it on and then you search the channel which you want.

0:38:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but I think the remote control, if you press, tap the screen, it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button, channel button and of course also the on- and off button.

0:38:59	SPEAKER_03
 I think it looks a lot more fancy if you need to...

0:39:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think so too.

0:39:02	SPEAKER_00
 I don't have any buttons on this.

0:39:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:39:05	SPEAKER_00
 No, actually we're going to create a button less...

0:39:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:39:08	SPEAKER_00
 No buttons at all.

0:39:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well that might be a unique selling point, huh?

0:39:12	SPEAKER_00
 Remote.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_00
 If you can afford...

0:39:14	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I guess...

0:39:15	SPEAKER_00
 Phone for the discussion to our next meeting because we're running out of time.

0:39:20	SPEAKER_00
 For now, we're having a lunch break.

0:39:24	SPEAKER_00
 And then there will be half an hour for the next share of individual work.

0:39:30	SPEAKER_00
 I will write minutes if I can create them out of this and put them in the project documents folder.

0:39:38	SPEAKER_00
 And here are the individual actions for the other roles.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_00
 And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your personal coach.

0:39:47	SPEAKER_00
 Luckily as we are.

0:39:49	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well, thank you very much.

0:39:51	SPEAKER_00
 You're welcome.

0:39:52	SPEAKER_00
 Lunch.

0:39:53	SPEAKER_00
 Have a nice lunch, huh?

0:39:54	SPEAKER_00
 Food.

0:39:55	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:40:00	SPEAKER_01
 Should we put this back in our room?

0:40:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think so.

0:40:04	SPEAKER_03
 It's a small...

0:40:07	None
 Yeah.

0:40:09	None
 Oh, yeah.

0:40:14	None
 Oh, yeah.

0:40:17	None
 Oh, yeah.

0:40:20	None
 Oh, sorry.

0:40:23	None
 Mm-hmm.

0:40:26	None
 No.

0:40:31	None
 No.

0:40:36	SPEAKER_04
 No.
