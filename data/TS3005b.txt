 Hello.

0:00:01	None
 Good morning.

0:00:02	None
 Again.

0:00:03	None
 Again.

0:00:04	None
 Again.

0:00:11	SPEAKER_00
 Again.

0:00:18	SPEAKER_02
 Good morning.

0:00:25	None
 Again.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_03
 One question.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_03
 Two and a number.

0:01:01	None
 A four.

0:01:06	None
 Okay.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_00
 All set.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_00
 Good.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see what we can find here.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_00
 A very warm welcome again to everyone.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_00
 Here we are already in our functional design meeting.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_00
 The opening, which we are doing now.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_00
 In the special note, I'm project manager, but on the meetings I'm also the secretary, which means I will make minutes as I did as the previous meeting.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_00
 And I'll also put these as fast as possible in the project folder so you can see them and review what we have discussed.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_00
 If I'm right, there are three presentations, I guess each one of you has prepared one.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_00
 Good.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_00
 And we will also take a look at new project requirements if you haven't heard about them yet.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_00
 And then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time, 40 minutes, but I think we will need it.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I don't know who wants to go first with this presentation.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_00
 Go first.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_04
 Should I go first with the user?

0:02:39	SPEAKER_04
 Let's see.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_04
 Everybody already has it.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_01
 You can adjust it.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_00
 And one question, your name, Denny, is it with AEA?

0:02:51	SPEAKER_00
 AEA.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_03
 I wanted to explain the working design of a remote control.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_03
 It's possible if you want to design one of those.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it basically works as I wrote down in this little summary.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_03
 When you press a button, that's when you do, for example, when you want to turn up the volume, a little connection is made.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_03
 The rubber button just presses on a little pin plate, which makes a connection that you can use.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_03
 A connection that gives the chips, which is mounted beneath those, that plastic of a rubber button, sends that connection has been made and knows what button you press, for example, the volume up or volume down button.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_03
 The chip makes Morse code like signal, which then is signaled to several transistors.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_03
 Which sends the signal to a little lat.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_03
 You know what a lat is?

0:04:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_03
 And that makes the infrared light signal, which is sent to the television set, which has a sensor in it to send the signal of the infrared.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_03
 And that's basically how it works.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_03
 The findings that I found searching up some detail information about remote controls are that they are very easy to produce.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_03
 This piece is possible to make them a mass production because it is as easy as printing a page, just a fiberglass plate.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_03
 It's covered with some coatings and chips.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_03
 And the technology is already available.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have to find out how remote controls have to work or how to make some chips that are possible to transmit those signals.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_03
 I made a little animation about how remote control works.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_04
 Innovation.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_01
 There is something turning.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's a little bug.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_03
 It's in the smartboard.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the subcomponent I suppose that you understand what the subcomponent is.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_03
 In this example, it's the button.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_03
 When it is pressed down, the switch is switched on.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_03
 So with the wire is sent to the chip in cooperation with the battery, of course, because to make a signal possible, you have to have some sort of electronic infrared light.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_03
 After it's being composed by the chip, the signal is transported to the infrared bulb.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_03
 From there, it signals a Morse code-like signal to the bulb in the television cell.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_03
 I wrote down some personal preferences about the remote control.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, it is very handy if the remote control is handheld, so you don't have to wind it up or something.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_03
 It's very light to use it.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_03
 I personally prefer that it would become available in various colors and easy to use buttons, but I suppose that one of the other team members thought of that too.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_03
 It is possible for several designs and easy to use buttons.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_03
 Perhaps soft touch, touch screen buttons because the rubber buttons are always slightly damaged.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_03
 So the numbers on the buttons are not possible to read anymore.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_03
 And as I said before, we can make several designs.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_03
 That's my contribution to this meeting.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_00
 I'll go next.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_00
 Please.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_00
 So.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_01
 Spoke it.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_01
 Well, my name is Emke Ljung and I looked at the technical functions design of the remote.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_01
 I did this by looking at examples of other remote controls, how they look and information from the web that I found.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_01
 What I found was that the actual use of remote control is to send messages to the video set, how you describe them.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_01
 And it can be all sorts of messages, turn it on, turn it off, change the channel, just fill in that kind of thing, play video text, but also play CD if you use your CD player.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_01
 There are some examples.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_01
 You can see they are very different.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_01
 The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need in a lot of buttons, etc.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_01
 And the other is more user friendly, little, it's big buttons and not all the stuff you can do with it, but the essential stuff is there.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_01
 I guess you could better, you should look at the user centered approach because the user centered approach because the customers have to use them and if they don't think it's usable, they won't buy it.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_01
 A lot of buttons they may think from idle meets as much as that.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_01
 Personal preferences is a simple remote with the basic functions that you can need that you could use, but keep in mind the new functions of TV, what we discussed earlier, split screen, is that a function that you should have because all the TVs will have them or because only a few ones isn't really necessary.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 And then I would make so that you could use it on more than one appliance.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_01
 If you have one that does the video, it could also work with the stereo because play is play and stop, stop and let's read it.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_01
 You could reuse the buttons so you don't have to have a lot of buttons for anything.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_01
 And it should be user friendly, clear buttons and not too much.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_01
 And that's just my presentation.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so, we're going to discuss the functional requirements of the remote.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_04
 That means that functions user want to have on the remote control or just the users actually.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_04
 The method I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we're going to focus on more.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_04
 Are the younger people going to buy remote control or the elderly people?

0:10:51	SPEAKER_04
 And that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_04
 Some data. Younger people from 16 to 45 years are more interested in features like LCD screens, speech recognition, etc.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_04
 And we possess about two-thirds of the market from in that range of H.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_04
 The elderly people from 45 years to 65 years are not that much interested in features and we possess less than two-thirds.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_04
 That's two-fifth of the market share in that area.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, findings. 50% of the users lose their remote often.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_04
 So we don't have to make it very small like a mobile phone or something but somewhat bigger than small so you don't lose it that much anymore.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_04
 75% of the users also find it ugly and 75% of users have a lot.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_04
 So the buttons should be that small or should be that complex because you have to search for buttons which one you're going to use.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_04
 Important issues about the remote. I think it would be better with the personal reference but okay.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_04
 Remote control have to have a low power usage because 75% of the users only step one time an hour.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_04
 So the power usage is also one time an hour so with a high power usage we would use a lot of batteries.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_04
 The following buttons and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control so those have to be find very easily and have to be somewhat like bigger etc.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_04
 It has also we have to find easily when the label is gone.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_04
 My colleague also knows that that label should be scratched off or who be off the slate.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_04
 So if that's the problem you also have to find it easily on the remote.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_04
 Buttons like what our colleague said have to be minimalized or should be covered or in LCD screen.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_04
 The LCD screen is easy because you have the LCD screen.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_04
 You have the first options put one option and then you have all the buttons of that option so the other options will be gone and you don't see the buttons.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_04
 So LCD screen should be easy but an LCD screen, the problem with the LCD screen is that elderly people from 45 to 65 years don't use the LCD screen.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_04
 So we have to keep that in mind that if you're going to implement LCD screen don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_03
 LCD screen as in touch screen?

0:13:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah touch screen.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_04
 The last but not least, younger people are more critical about the features because they use the remote control often more often and are more technical than all the people.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_04
 And all the people spend more money and easily on the remote control.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_04
 So we have to keep in mind to focus not a lot, not that much on the younger people but also somewhat on elderly people.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_04
 And on my personal references I don't have any more time to comment that but like I said LCD screen is easily to use because you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_04
 And it should be easy to use especially the following buttons, the channel buttons and the number buttons to step through the channels.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_04
 And that is it.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_00
 Well thank you all.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_00
 Did everyone receive an email with the new project requirements?

0:14:57	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_01
 I did not.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_01
 Perhaps there is.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_00
 And then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them so you can all read them.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, well not in this presentation.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_00
 It should be in there.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_00
 Well I can tell you them from my laptop.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_00
 The data text has become outdated since the popularity of the internet.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_00
 So that's the first thing I think we should pay less attention to the data text.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_00
 Remote control should only be used for the television otherwise the project becomes more complex which endangers the time to market and of course we'll make it more costly I think.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_00
 Our current customers are within the age group of 40 plus.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_00
 New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than 40 and you talked about it before.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_00
 And a last point but also very important.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_00
 Our corporate image should stay recognizable in our products which means that our corporate color and slogan must be implemented in the new design.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to keep that in mind.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_00
 Well according to our agenda it's time to take a decision on the remote control functions.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_00
 So who has any idea what should be on it and what shouldn't?

0:16:14	SPEAKER_01
 You said it should only be with one appliance or with one the only the TV.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, only with video also.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_01
 Only for television.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_00
 Makes it a lot easier.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_04
 So yeah then you can requirements, no functions.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_01
 Then it should have on off.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, stand by basics, stand by a volume channel, one till two zero numbers on it.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_04
 The data text doesn't have to be.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_04
 Other functions.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I can say from one number to two.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's easy to implement the button with a special, which especially do that because some TVs if you press this one and then the two.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_04
 It makes it be between five seconds you make twelve.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_04
 That's relaxed.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_03
 And there are some models that don't accommodate that function.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_03
 So the Philips television makes plus one and that indeed to press one and then two to make an easy reach, to reach them twelve.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_03
 But all the television makes use of those buttons where you first press that button and then press two digits to.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_01
 So you tap that one.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_04
 Main targets, HR were 45 plus or?

0:17:44	SPEAKER_00
 Well, new products should reach a market with customers that are younger than 40.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_04
 And now we have every customer.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_04
 Because younger people have 16 to 25 age or 81% interest in LCD screen from 26 to 35 to 66% and 36 to 45 to 55%.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_04
 So I think because most of the print plate will be broken for about two years, you have to press very hard to go to the next channel with the LCD screen.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_04
 It's easy because you only have to wipe the screen for a fingerprint.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_03
 And then you can use that.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_03
 That collides with our mission to make it very cheap.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_03
 Because LCD screens are very expensive.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_03
 Touch screen.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_03
 Probably even more.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_03
 True.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's possible to make an LCD screen.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_03
 How was the information?

0:18:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it only says that this percentage like LCD screen, because it says that younger age between 16 and 45 highly interested features more critical.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_03
 Perhaps we should focus on the LCD screen.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because our target is 16 to 45.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but will we not exceed our reduction cost?

0:19:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, you don't know how much cost LCD screen is it possible to find out?

0:19:20	SPEAKER_04
 I don't have any costs here.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_04
 I only have percentages.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_01
 What if you do an LCD, do we have any buttons?

0:19:34	SPEAKER_03
 An LCD screen is just like a drone here.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_03
 It displays several buttons.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_03
 For example, if you want the minimal use buttons such as channel and volume, it displays four buttons on the screen.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_03
 And it's possible to press them down just like a touchscreen.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_01
 So you can adjust which buttons you want on them.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's possible to adjust the audio settings, press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_04
 So the other buttons are gone.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_00
 So we're going for an LCD screen?

0:20:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's the most easy thing.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_00
 And I'm hoping that when we produce a lot, it won't be too expensive.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_01
 We had 1250, I guess?

0:20:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, 1250?

0:20:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I don't know how expensive.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 Any guesses?

0:20:23	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I suppose if the young people are interested in LCD screens, we surely make them.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_03
 And if that is our market share to our goal to deliver those remotely.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_01
 You also said that we should not only focus on the younger people, but also the older.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but...

0:20:46	SPEAKER_01
 Will they use it if it's only as an LCD screen?

0:20:48	SPEAKER_04
 It's 46 to 45, 33% and 56 to 65 to 12%.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_04
 But our project requirements are the new products will be reached for new markets with customers that are younger than 40.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_01
 But you don't want to eliminate the other ones?

0:21:05	SPEAKER_04
 No, they're not now.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_01
 But if they also buy them, that's all right.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but market share for 40 years and younger is higher than 65 in younger.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so LCD it is?

0:21:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, let's try to...

0:21:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, if it gets too much to expensive, then we should be sticking to rubber buttons.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think that they will send you some information about the cost of LCD.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_04
 No costs at all.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_03
 So if you receive an email about that, can you post it in our project map?

0:21:49	SPEAKER_04
 I think that should... I think we all get the costs of everything.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_03
 Because you are the marketing expert.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_04
 I'll post it.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_01
 I figured out the backup plan that we would use.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_01
 Sure, sure.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, but for now, LCD.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_04
 Then you have 75% of use finding it ugly.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_01
 LCD?

0:22:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_04
 And 80% of the users would spend more money with it when a remote would look fancy.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, this is a problem.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_04
 It'll fancy with the LCD screen.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but they don't like it.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_01
 They think it's ugly when it has an LCD.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, just the play remotes, not specific LCD remotes.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_01
 All right, that's all the new setup.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, maybe you can make something fancy out of an LCD remote because it's new as far as I know.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, of course.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_04
 And then you have the other thing that's 75% sep a lot, but that's not a question with the LCD screen.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_04
 The only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off of one of these in time to get all your fingerprints off of it.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, what else does a remote need?

0:22:57	SPEAKER_00
 A mute button.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_00
 Mute button.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_00
 Mm-hmm.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_04
 I think.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_04
 The most important thing on the remote control are channel selection, volume selection, and power usage.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_04
 And the Taylor text, but that is not of the question.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_04
 Other things are...

0:23:17	SPEAKER_01
 I think you put a button of Taylor text for people who want to use it.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it would be.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I've got a big remote.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_00
 I'd have to fill it.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and we could make a separate menu on the LCD.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_04
 And also less important things are screen settings, audio settings, and channel settings.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, less important, because I think they should be there.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it should be there, but not...

0:23:41	SPEAKER_03
 But in a sub-press menu.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sub-menu.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's also important to make possible to...

0:23:48	SPEAKER_03
 Anycon in English?

0:23:50	SPEAKER_03
 And to not use batteries and use...

0:23:54	SPEAKER_03
 But...

0:23:55	SPEAKER_03
...acry batteries to...

0:23:57	SPEAKER_02
 I would be very proud.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sure.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so you can mount the...

0:24:03	SPEAKER_03
...the remote control to charge it.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_01
 We should think of it 1250.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but we don't...

0:24:11	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know why it says...

0:24:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so...

0:24:13	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, because when you get an LCD screen, you run it on batteries.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_01
 The batteries will be...

0:24:18	SPEAKER_01
...the very...

0:24:19	SPEAKER_01
...the...

0:24:20	SPEAKER_01
...the...

0:24:21	SPEAKER_01
...the...

0:24:22	SPEAKER_01
...the...

0:24:23	SPEAKER_01
...the...

0:24:24	SPEAKER_01
...the...

0:24:25	SPEAKER_03
...the...

0:24:26	SPEAKER_01
...the...

0:24:27	SPEAKER_01
...the...

0:24:28	SPEAKER_01
...the very...

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
... phr capital for extra that you have...

0:24:30	SPEAKER_01
...first to turn the remote on, and then you can...

0:24:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think it's not...

0:24:35	SPEAKER_04
...that easy, because I don't think people like to...

0:24:40	SPEAKER_04
...that you have to do it first, and then use it.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's better than...

0:24:44	SPEAKER_04
 The ticket shuts down, the remote shuts down...

0:24:46	SPEAKER_04
...the...

0:24:47	SPEAKER_03
......code standard, when you know users...

0:24:50	SPEAKER_01
... hijack!

0:24:51	SPEAKER_01
 Automatically...

0:24:52	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, I have to rearrange this.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_03
... a few minutes or so here, not a few minutes.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and maybe a low battery indicator

0:25:04	SPEAKER_04
 Before our when it's get again gets empty they have plenty of time to recharge it I've put it in a charger

0:25:13	SPEAKER_00
 We are going for a recharge

0:25:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah Because when you're watching TV you're zapping you have to put it in a rechargeer

0:25:30	SPEAKER_03
 When you're done with

0:25:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, okay, but don't be watching you sure that the batteries go of our six hours five

0:25:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah

0:25:40	SPEAKER_03
 But you also forget to buy batteries Yeah, you can you can't use it so I or have to be sure that the batteries lost a couple of days with the church

0:25:50	SPEAKER_01
 So I think the battery should should work a lot longer than a couple of yeah, but but you have a LCD screen

0:25:58	SPEAKER_03
 My power uses so It should be a standard move to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television. That's also a Great advantage because you can't lose it anymore Because you are obliged to put in the charger and not to leave any couch between some cushions

0:26:23	SPEAKER_04
 Okay

0:26:28	SPEAKER_01
 You're near your couch Because otherwise you have to yeah, just a small device

0:26:38	SPEAKER_04
 Like definitely charge or something and just just the cable or even

0:26:43	SPEAKER_03
 Charging when you come out it on yeah something like that

0:26:49	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, well easy to use also My chair speaker speech recognition I

0:26:59	SPEAKER_03
 For the otherly you could make it possible to enlarge the screen to make it possible to not Display a button at 10 points. I think that this will be standard I have a bunch of options you have to specify because we can look at perhaps 40 buttons at the screen but in the otherly I only look at two buttons

0:27:31	SPEAKER_00
 Something about speech recognition. Yeah, it says

0:27:37	SPEAKER_04
 Also 91% 60 to 25 26 to 35 years 76% and 36 to 45 35%

0:27:54	SPEAKER_03
 Let's leave out all the remote controls and just put a microphone That's an idea It has to be remote control

0:28:13	SPEAKER_01
 No, they want to talk into the remote control

0:28:27	SPEAKER_04
 I think the LCD screen should be sufficient

0:28:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's a lot. That's the option should be why not? Why not?

0:28:46	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's better to have LLC screen because in the area of 36 to 45 we have about 30% of the market share in Our hands and 55 of those people want LCD screen at 35 on speech recognition So I think it's better to keep it with LCD screen

0:29:06	SPEAKER_00
 Would it be useful to implement both?

0:29:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, with the costs of allowed

0:29:13	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know that can be done with the cost of 12

0:29:17	SPEAKER_04
 If it should be done if it could be done

0:29:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I would like to implement that you say volume up and then

0:29:27	SPEAKER_03
 Certain systems already exist I think

0:29:29	SPEAKER_01
 Then you also have to have different languages if we go international It's used to do French and English

0:29:37	SPEAKER_04
 But that should be also coming with some software also with LCD screen Because I think it's a different written volume is different within than So I hear you're something

0:29:49	SPEAKER_01
 You can use icons for the The speaker and the That's better than language

0:29:58	SPEAKER_03
 So you want to hear it's international

0:30:02	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, what else?

0:30:04	SPEAKER_00
 So no speech recognition?

0:30:07	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if it could be done with

0:30:09	SPEAKER_03
 It should be done, it could be done

0:30:11	SPEAKER_00
 And then with different languages

0:30:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that should be

0:30:15	SPEAKER_03
 That's not so difficult I already used several Voice-operated systems and they are all possible to No, that's difficult

0:30:26	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you should suggest everything

0:30:28	SPEAKER_04
 Every language of dialects Yeah, I think it's very difficult

0:30:32	SPEAKER_01
 You have to speak so that it can understand

0:30:36	SPEAKER_04
 I think it can be implemented but maybe

0:30:39	SPEAKER_01
 You can use that as an option Yes, an option, yes

0:30:43	SPEAKER_04
 Money left or something 50 years, yes

0:30:47	SPEAKER_03
 Let's do speech Speech recognition

0:30:51	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so we only do it when we have enough money left Okay, well, I've written down an honor off button Volume selection channel selection digits from 1 to 0 From 0 to 9 A digit button to switch between 1 and 2 digits Mute button, a separate menu for a teletext A battery indicator We're going to use a docking station And probably LCD And if there's enough money, speech recognition And the possibility to enlarge buttons or to have large buttons

0:31:31	SPEAKER_01
 With teletext, it wasn't really important No, but Also now I've colored I don't know if we should implement that Color?

0:31:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, when you press the red button You go to page 102 and we press the I don't know if we should implement that Because it says that teletext is not really important Short cuts Yeah, short cuts

0:31:52	SPEAKER_04
 I'll take which we could also implement the audio settings, screen settings And channel settings but at sub menus

0:32:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah

0:32:01	SPEAKER_04
 The mainly, if you turn the remote control on You have to see 1 to 0 channel volume And if you want to use the teletext screen or audio then you can press it

0:32:11	SPEAKER_03
 It should be available but not directly available Yeah, okay

0:32:19	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so not too much the teletext support But in a separate menu

0:32:24	SPEAKER_01
 So actually it is there But it's just not ready there

0:32:27	SPEAKER_03
 It's not ready there So it doesn't confuse the user We have to search It has to be easy to use I'll search If you want to use the teletext You can press the teletext button And then the options become available

0:32:42	SPEAKER_04
 The side of it

0:32:43	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but no more buttons or functions Though what else can you do with that?

0:32:49	SPEAKER_00
 And we forgetting something I've got to cut you examples here

0:32:53	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't think there's anything we should

0:32:56	SPEAKER_04
 Play pause doesn't need to be

0:32:58	SPEAKER_01
 We don't have a video on this

0:33:00	SPEAKER_04
 So if you have a voice issue or presentation You could check the other remote controls Technical functions

0:33:08	SPEAKER_01
 Hey, you could hear Oh, the other

0:33:09	SPEAKER_04
 Which was real

0:33:10	SPEAKER_01
 And the technical functions They're a bit small You could be able to shoot stretch them Because

0:33:18	SPEAKER_04
 Bing! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Technical functions Okay

0:33:23	SPEAKER_01
 I guess we've got a more

0:33:25	SPEAKER_04
 Uh, I think I got you half only You have a mute play Yeah, let's ask you for the video Free slow Yeah, the zoom buttons

0:33:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, white screen

0:33:39	SPEAKER_04
 High screen Different things you have

0:33:41	SPEAKER_01
 I'll let you put them on now Yeah, different too Yeah With that should also be a sub menu

0:33:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it should be available But that is a screen setting or something

0:33:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah So we should also implement a screen setting

0:33:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, screen settings, audio settings The other settings you have

0:33:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah

0:33:58	SPEAKER_04
 General settings

0:34:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah So you can probably Those four and of course the main Yeah, so first you see the main And the other ones you can go to

0:34:07	SPEAKER_04
 Like depth screens or something or I don't know

0:34:11	SPEAKER_01
 I hope we can do this Yeah, actually it depends

0:34:16	SPEAKER_03
 On what kind of television you got Because if you don't got a white screen Television, you don't need to be I don't need to be Screen settings

0:34:21	SPEAKER_04
 They don't use it

0:34:23	SPEAKER_03
 And if the television does not support Such operations

0:34:27	SPEAKER_01
 So you don't have to use that tab

0:34:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah Yeah So you leave it Hello Yeah Yeah Or it could be possible to have a Standard version of the remote Yeah Expanded version

0:34:39	SPEAKER_01
 And do we want to win different colors or The buttons, you say?

0:34:44	SPEAKER_01
 Colors

0:34:45	SPEAKER_03
 Colors I think the main color of the Remote Control is the color of the LCD screen Because we don't want to love itself And if I

0:34:53	SPEAKER_04
 Have a device of how many percent? 80% I think it's ugly We'll spend more money if it looks fancy

0:34:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so use a lot of people

0:35:02	SPEAKER_01
 Perhaps you can make a adjustable front Like with the Un- I just want phones You can Okay You can Okay So you're a system But I think that's

0:35:11	SPEAKER_03
 Well Make it a little bit different colors

0:35:14	None
 Yeah Red, white, blue, black And a sea Gray She's your first Simpsons versions And she press a button

0:35:26	SPEAKER_04
 It turns green Yeah Leave

0:35:29	SPEAKER_02
 Well

0:35:31	SPEAKER_00
 Five minutes Single for our Final five minutes So I have the things I just read Then we have separate menus for Data Text Screen Settings Audio Settings And well

0:35:44	SPEAKER_04
 Channel Settings

0:35:45	SPEAKER_01
 Alright So you can program that too Yeah

0:35:47	SPEAKER_00
 Okay So you can

0:35:49	None
 Yeah Perhaps you should Throw them in one pile So options And then use them Yeah Otherwise you have all those data Perhaps they'll text Not

0:36:01	SPEAKER_04
 Or like If we menu button

0:36:03	SPEAKER_00
 Also a separate menu

0:36:04	SPEAKER_04
 Or also a menu button First menu Then you have Main All the settings

0:36:11	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but we can work it out Yeah So later I guess So we're having a general menu With the most used functions Data Text Screen Settings Audio Settings Channel Settings And maybe there are options for the remote itself Like large icons or small icons What else?

0:36:29	SPEAKER_04
 I think Because we don't have a lot of buttons on the one screen I think the buttons Yeah, but Like we only have the general button The volume button Those buttons Yeah

0:36:40	SPEAKER_02
 There's also an ESD Right Yeah Right

0:36:43	SPEAKER_01
 So we don't have any normal buttons No, no normal buttons

0:36:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah Maybe only the on and off button

0:36:48	SPEAKER_00
 We don't need the special options menu for the remote itself No Okay

0:36:56	SPEAKER_01
 Oh well, you should be able to set which TV you have If you have a TV

0:37:01	SPEAKER_03
 Of course you need the settings button Or a settings option for the remote control

0:37:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah But is it an idea to use what you said Normal on and off button for the TV?

0:37:13	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, no

0:37:14	SPEAKER_04
 Because we discussed that you could charge it Otherwise it It jumps to standby mode

0:37:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but not for the remote but for the TV

0:37:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, the TV of course I think that's the best thing is that To implement that one in the menu with the volume

0:37:31	SPEAKER_01
 But they're not as normal but the ESD

0:37:33	SPEAKER_00
 Well, maybe there should be a separate button Apart from the ESD Because you can't turn it on when the ESD is off So how do you turn the thing on that?

0:37:41	SPEAKER_00
 So we are Why you just tap it?

0:37:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you just tap it That's proofing Okay, then it's turn it off And then the television is on also or just remote?

0:37:48	SPEAKER_00
 No, just remote

0:37:49	SPEAKER_04
 The television doesn't have to be on That's where you can press on

0:37:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it should be a standby mode

0:37:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, standby then Press on the remote Press on and then TV should be Affailable

0:37:59	SPEAKER_01
 Or not I don't know whether it's handling to have a normal on button Just for the TV so you can turn it on And then you can choose channel Otherwise you I don't know whether or not That's

0:38:11	SPEAKER_03
 A normal button on the remote control

0:38:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, or normal To turn it on Or you should put it in the ESD screen

0:38:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because when you touch the ESD screen When it is in standby mode It should pop on Why would it be handy to have an on button?

0:38:33	SPEAKER_01
 I guess if you use the ESD screen You first have search where it's the on button And then you then turn And then the TV goes on But if you have a normal on button on the remote Then you do it on And then you search the channel Which you want

0:38:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but I think the remote control If you press tap the screen It always should jump to the screen Which has the volume button Channel button And of course also the on and off button

0:38:59	SPEAKER_03
 I think it looks a lot more fancy Yeah, I think so too

0:39:02	SPEAKER_00
 I don't have any buttons on No, actually we're going to create a button less No buttons at all Okay, well that might be a unique selling point Remote If you can afford it Well, I guess Let's put on the discussion to our next meeting Because we're running out of time For now we're having a lunch break And then there will be Half an hour for the next share of individual work I will write minutes If I can create them out of this And put them in the project document folder And here are the individual actions for the other roles And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again By your personal coach Luckily as we are Okay, well thank you very much You just want to have a nice lunch Food

0:39:59	SPEAKER_01
 Should we put this back in our room? I think so

0:40:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think so I think it's a small piece

0:40:05	None
 Yeah Yeah But look, there you go Yep, yep, yep Yeah That's right Oh, sorry s So...
