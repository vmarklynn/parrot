0:00:00	None
 Hello.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_00
 Good morning.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_00
 Again.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_02
 Again.

0:00:24	None
 Good morning.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_03
 Good morning.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_03
 Good morning.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_00
 All set? Good.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see what we can find here.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_00
 A very warm welcome again to everyone.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_00
 Here we are already in our functional design meeting.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_00
 This is what we are going to do, the opening, which we are doing now.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_00
 I'm a project manager, but on the meetings I'm also the secretary, which means I will make minutes as I did at the previous meeting.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_00
 I also put these as fast as possible in the project folder, so you can see them and review what we have discussed.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_00
 If I'm right, there are three presentations.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_00
 Each one of you is prepared.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_00
 Good.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_00
 We will also take a look at new project requirements, if you haven't heard about them yet.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_00
 Then we have to take a decision on the remote control functions, and we have some more time, 40 minutes, but I think we will need it.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know who wants to go first with this presentation.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_04
 Shall I go first?

0:02:36	SPEAKER_04
 Shall I go first with the user?

0:02:39	SPEAKER_04
 I think you are not going to go first.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_01
 Is there an order?

0:02:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, it's presentation.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_00
 You can adjust it.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_00
 One question, your name, Denny?

0:02:51	SPEAKER_00
 Is it with AEA?

0:02:53	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_03
 I wanted to explain the work and design of a remote control.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_03
 It's possible if you are handy if you want to design one of those.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_03
 Basically, it works as I wrote down in this little summary.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_03
 When you press a button, that's when you do, for example, when you want to turn up the volume, a little connection is made.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_03
 The rubber button just presses on a little pin plate, which makes a connection that gives the chips, which is mounted beneath that plastic rubber button, a sense that connection has been made, and knows what button you pressed, for example, the volume up or volume down button.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_03
 The chip makes a Morse code like signal, which then is signals to several transistors, which sends the signal to a little lat.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_03
 You know what a lat is?

0:04:10	SPEAKER_03
 That makes the infrared light signal, which is sent to the television set, which has a sensor in it to send the signal of the infrared.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_03
 That's basically how it works.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_03
 The findings that I found searching up some detail information about remote controls are that they are very easy to produce.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_03
 It's possible to make them a mass production, because this is as easy as printing a page, just a fiberglass plate.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_03
 It's covered with some coatings and chips.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_03
 The technology is already available.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have to find out how remote controls have to work, or how to make some chips that are possible to transmit those signals.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_03
 I made a little animation.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_03
 How I turned the remote control works.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_01
 There is something to it.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_00
 It's a little bug in the smartboard.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the subcomponent I suppose that you understand what subcomponent is.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_03
 In this example, it's the button.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_03
 When it is pressed down, the switch is switched on, so the wire is sent to the chip in cooperation with the battery, of course, because to make a signal possible, you have to have some electronic infrared light.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yes?

0:06:05	SPEAKER_03
 After it's being composed by the chip, the signal is transported to the infrared bulb.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_03
 From there, it signals a more-scode-like signal to the bulb in the television set.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_03
 I wrote down some personal preferences about the remote control.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, it is very handy if the remote control is handheld, so you don't have to wind it up or something, it's very light to use it.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_03
 I personally prefer that it would become available in various colors.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_03
 And easy to use buttons, but I suppose that the other team members thought of that too.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_03
 And it is possible for several designs.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_03
 Easy to use buttons.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_03
 Perhaps soft touch screen buttons, because the rubber buttons are always slightly damaged, so the numbers on the buttons are not possible to read anymore.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_03
 Before we can make several designs.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_03
 That's my contribution to this meeting.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_00
 This meeting.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, please.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_01
 Well, my name is Im Kriong, and I looked at the technical functions design of the remote.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_01
 I did this by looking at examples of other remote controls, of how they look and information from the web that I found.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_01
 What I found was that the actual use of remote control is to send messages to the television set, how you describe it.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_01
 And it can be all sorts of messages, turn it on, turn it off, change the channel, just fill in with kind of thing, play video text, but also play CD if you use your CD player.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_01
 There are some examples of remote controls.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_01
 You can see they are very different.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_01
 The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and a lot of buttons, etc.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_01
 And the other is more user friendly, little with big buttons, and not all the stuff you can do with it, but the essential stuff is there.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_01
 I guess you could better, you should look at the user centered approach because the customers have to use them.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_01
 And if they don't think it's usable, they want to buy it.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_01
 A lot of buttons they may think from, I don't meet as much as that.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_01
 Well, personal preference is a simple remote with the basic functions that you can need.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_01
 You could use.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_01
 But keep in mind the new functions of TV, what we discussed earlier, split screen, and is that a function that you should have with all the TVs you have them, or because only a few of them isn't really necessary.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 And then I would make sure that you could use it on more than one appliance.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_01
 If you have one that does the video, it could also work with the stereo, because play is play and stop, stop, and everything.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_01
 You could reuse the buttons, so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for anything.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_01
 And it should be user friendly, clear buttons, and not too much.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_01
 And that's my presentation.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, I'll hear you.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_04
 Check.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_01
 You must still have to open.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_04
 So, we're going to discuss the functional requirements of the remote.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_04
 That means that functions user want to have on the remote control, or just, yeah, the user's actually.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_04
 The medit, I prefer, is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus more, are the younger people going to buy remote control, or the elderly people, and that section we're going to focus, and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_04
 Some data.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_04
 Younger people from six and four, four, five years are more interested in features, like LCD screen speech recognition, et cetera.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_04
 And we process about two-third of the market from in that range of age.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_04
 The elderly people from 45 years to 65 years are not that much interested in features, and we process less than two-third, that's two-fifth of the market share in that area.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_04
 Finings.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_04
 50% of the users lose their remote often, so we don't have to make very small, like a mobile phone or something, but somewhat bigger than small, so you don't lose it that much anymore.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_04
 75% of the users also find it ugly, and 75% of the users have a lot.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_04
 So the buttons should be that small, or should be that complex, because you have to search for the buttons, which one you're going to use.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_04
 Important issues about the remote.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_04
 I think this would be better with the personal reference, but okay.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_04
 Remote control has to have a low power usage, because 75% of the users only set one time an hour, so the power usage is also one time an hour, so with a high power usage, we would use a lot of batteries.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_04
 The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control, so those have to be find very easily, and have to be somewhat like bigger, et cetera.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_04
 It has also to be, I have to find easily when the label is gone.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_04
 My colleague also announced that the label should be scratched off, or who is off-gust later.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_04
 So if that's the problem, you also have to find it easily on the remote.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_04
 Buttons, like what our colleague said, have to be minimalized, or should be covered, or in the LCD screen.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_04
 The LCD screen is easy, because you have the LCD screen.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_04
 You have the various options, put one option, and then you have all the buttons of that option, so the other options will be gone, and you don't see the buttons.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_04
 So LCD screen should be easy, but an LCD screen, the problem with the LCD screen is that elderly people from 65 years don't use the LCD screen a lot.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_04
 So we have to keep that in mind, that if you're going to implement the LCD screen, don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_03
 LCD screen as in touch screen.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, touch screen.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_04
 The last, but at least, younger people are more critical about the features, because they use the remote control often more often, and are more technical than all the people, and all the people spend more money, and easily on the remote control.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_04
 So we have to keep in mind to focus not that much on the younger people, but also somewhat on the elderly people.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_04
 And our personal references, I don't have any more time to come with that, but like I said, LCD screen is easily to use, because you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote, with not that much buttons, and it should be used to use, especially the following buttons, the channel buttons, and the number buttons to set through the channels.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_04
 And that is it.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, okay.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_00
 Well, thank you all, huh?

0:14:52	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_00
 Did everyone receive an email with the new project requirements?

0:14:57	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_00
 No?

0:14:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I did not.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_01
 Can you perhaps hear us?

0:15:01	SPEAKER_00
 Then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them, so you can all read them.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, well, not in this presentation.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_00
 Hmm.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_00
 Should be in there.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_00
 I can tell you them from my laptop.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_00
 Teletect has become outdated since the popularity of the internet.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_00
 So that's the first thing we, I think, we should pay less attention to the teletect.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_00
 The remote control should only be used for the television, otherwise the project becomes more complex, which, in danger, is the time to market, and of course, we'll make it more costly, I think.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_00
 Our current customers are within the age group of 40 plus.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_00
 New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than 40, and you talked about that before.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_00
 And a last point, but also very important, our corporate image should stay recognizable in our products, which means that our corporate color and slogan must be implemented in the new design.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to keep that in mind.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_00
 Well, according to our agenda, it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_00
 So who has any idea what should be on it and what shouldn't?

0:16:14	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you said that you should only...

0:16:17	SPEAKER_01
 With one appliance, or with one, did you say only the TV?

0:16:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, only the video also, or not.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, it's only for television here.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_00
 Next is a lot easier.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_04
 So yeah, then you can...

0:16:34	SPEAKER_04
 Requirements.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_04
 No, functions.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_01
 Then you should have the on-off.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, based on volume channel, one till two zero numbers on it.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_04
 And the text doesn't have to be.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_04
 Other phone.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I had...

0:16:53	SPEAKER_01
 You can say from one number to two numbers.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, no.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's easy to implement, but with what, especially do that, because some TVs, if you press this one and then the two, between five, six, you make twelve.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_04
 And that means that's relaxed.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_03
 Relax.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_03
 And there are some models that don't accommodate that function.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_03
 So the Phillips television makes possible, and that indeed to press one and then two to make a...

0:17:27	SPEAKER_03
 Easy to reach, 10, 12.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_03
 But all the television makes use of those, and when you first press that button, and then press two digits to...

0:17:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so you have that one.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, thank you.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_04
 All main targets.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_04
 HR?

0:17:42	SPEAKER_04
 We're 45 plus or...

0:17:44	SPEAKER_00
 Well, new products should reach a market with customers that are younger than 40.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_00
 And now we have...

0:17:49	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, because...

0:17:50	SPEAKER_04
 40 plus.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_04
 Because younger people...

0:17:54	SPEAKER_04
 Younger people have...

0:17:56	SPEAKER_04
 Now, 16 to 25...

0:17:58	SPEAKER_04
 H are 81% interested in LCD screen.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_04
 From 26 to 35 to 66%, and 36 to 45 to 55%.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_04
 So I think to...

0:18:12	SPEAKER_04
 Because on most remote controls, the print plate will be broken in about two years.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_04
 You have to press very hard to go to the next set with the LCD screens easier, because you only have to wipe the screen for the fingerprint.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_03
 And then you can use that.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that collides with our mission to make it fair cheap.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because the LCD screen is very expensive.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but the touchscreen...

0:18:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but the touchscreen probably even more.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_03
 True.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_03
 True.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_03
 Well...

0:18:42	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's possible to make an LCD screen.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_03
 How was the information?

0:18:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it only says that this percentage is like LCD screen, because it says that younger age between 16 and 45, highly interested features more critical.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_03
 Because perhaps we should focus on the LCD screen.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because our target is 16 to 45.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but we will not...

0:19:13	SPEAKER_03
 Exceed our...

0:19:15	SPEAKER_03
 We don't know how much it costs.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, you don't know how much it costs, LCD screen.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_04
 Is it possible to find out?

0:19:20	SPEAKER_04
 No, I don't have any costs here. I only have percentages.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_01
 What if you would do an LCD screen?

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
 Do we have...

0:19:28	SPEAKER_01
 Don't you have any buttons?

0:19:29	SPEAKER_01
 Or because it's only direct at the TV.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_01
 Then you only have...

0:19:33	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know what you want to...

0:19:34	SPEAKER_03
 No, an LCD screen is just like a drone here.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_03
 It just displays several buttons.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_03
 For example, if you want the minimal use buttons such as channel and volume, it just displays four buttons on the screen.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_03
 And it's possible to press them down just like a touchscreen.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_01
 So you can adjust which buttons you want on the screen?

0:19:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it will make a possible like that.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_04
 I'll just add your settings, press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_04
 So the other buttons are gone.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_00
 So we're going for an LCD screen.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's the most interesting thing here.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_00
 And hoping that when we produce a lot, it won't be too expensive.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 But we had 1250, I guess, for a rev limiter?

0:20:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_01
 How expensive is that?

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 Any guesses?

0:20:23	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I suppose with...

0:20:27	SPEAKER_03
 If the young people are interested in LCD screens, we shall make them.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_03
 And if that is our market share to our goal to deliver those remotely.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_01
 And we also said that we should not only focus on the younger people also on the older people.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but will they use it if it only has an LCD screen?

0:20:48	SPEAKER_04
 46 to 45, 33% and 56 to 65 to 12%.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_04
 But our project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets with customers that are younger than 40.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_01
 But you don't want to alienate the other?

0:21:05	SPEAKER_04
 No, they're not now.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_01
 So if they also buy them, that's all right.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but market share for 40 years in younger is higher than that of 60%.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think that of 65 in younger.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so LCD it is?

0:21:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_03
 It's true.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_02
 How do we...

0:21:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, if it gets too much to expensive, then we should be sticking to rubber buttons.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, can you...

0:21:34	SPEAKER_03
 I think that the day we'll send you some information about the cost of LCD screen.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_04
 We're not seeing no costs at all.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_03
 So if you receive an email about that, can you post it in the...

0:21:47	SPEAKER_03
 I should be post that in our project map, I think.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_04
 I think we all get the costs of everything.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_03
 Because you are the marketing...

0:21:58	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, okay.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_04
 I'll post it.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_01
 We should have a backup plan that we would use, but...

0:22:03	SPEAKER_01
 Sure, sure.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, but for now, LCD, yeah.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_04
 Then you have 75% of use finally to ugly.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, LCD.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_04
 And 80% of the users would spend more money with the random remote who would look fancy.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, this is...

0:22:18	SPEAKER_01
 No problem.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_04
 No, it'll look fancy with the LCD screen.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but they don't like it.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_01
 They think it's ugly.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_01
 When it has an LCD.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, they just play your remote.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_04
 Not specific LCD remote.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_01
 I told them you said that.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe you can make something fancy out of an LCD remote because it's new, as far as I know.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, of course.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_04
 And then you have another thing that's 75% separate, but that's not a question with the LCD screen.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_04
 The only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off one is in the time to get all the fingerprints off it.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, what else does our remote need?

0:22:58	SPEAKER_00
 The remote button.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_04
 The remote button.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_04
 The most important things on a remote control are channel selection, volume selection, and power usage, and the tailed text, but that is not of the question.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_01
 Other things are...

0:23:18	SPEAKER_01
 You can put a button of the tailed text on the...

0:23:21	SPEAKER_01
 For people who want to use it.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it could be.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I've got a big remote.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_00
 Which means you have to fill.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and we could make a separate menu on the LCD.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, the tailed text.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, thanks.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_04
 And also less important things are screen settings, audio settings, and channel settings.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, less important, because I think they should be there.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it should be there, but not in a separate menu.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think it's also important to make it possible to...

0:23:48	SPEAKER_03
 How do you call it in English?

0:23:52	SPEAKER_03
 To not use batteries, and use batteries to...

0:23:57	SPEAKER_03
 I have a little help.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so you can mount the...

0:24:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the brackets.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_03
 And remote control to...

0:24:06	SPEAKER_03
 Charge it.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_01
 I think of it to...

0:24:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but we don't...

0:24:10	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know why it's so easy to add.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because when you get an LCD screen, you run it on batteries.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_03
 Batteries will be...

0:24:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_01
...for each one of the most important things.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_01
 Perhaps you should be able to switch the control off.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_01
 If you have an LCD screen that burns all the time, you know.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_01
 You shouldn't...

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 That's where extra that you have first to turn the remote on, and then you can...

0:24:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think it's not that easy, because I don't think people like it...

0:24:39	SPEAKER_04
 That you have to turn it on first, and then use it.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's better when the D-fish shuts down or remote shuts down.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_03
 And it goes turn by mile when you don't use it.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, automatically.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, automatically.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_00
 And maybe a low battery indicator?

0:24:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, on the screen.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_04
 Sure.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_04
 Before an hour when it gets empty, they have plenty of time to recharge it.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_04
 Of the pudding in rechargeer.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_04
 Charger.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_00
 So we are going for a rechargeer.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's slim.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_04
 It's slim.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_04
 It's sensible.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because when you're watching TV, you're stepping, you have to put it in rechargeer.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's what you're doing.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_03
 When you're done with...

0:25:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay, but don't be...

0:25:33	SPEAKER_04
 Watch me show that you have to put batteries go six hours five, six hours.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_01
 But you also forget to put it in.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's probably...

0:25:40	SPEAKER_01
 You start on a couch and you don't...

0:25:41	SPEAKER_03
 But you also forget to buy batteries.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_03
 And then you can use it.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_04
 You have to be sure that the battery is lost a couple of days with the torch.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_01
 So I think the battery should work a lot longer than a couple of days?

0:25:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because you have a LCD screen.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's...

0:25:58	SPEAKER_04
 Hi-Power usage.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_03
 Hi-Power usage.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_03
 So it should be a standard move to put your remote control in the charger when you're done with watching television.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_03
 That's also a great advantage because you can't lose it anymore.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_03
 You are obliged to put in the charger and not to leave any a couch between some cushions.

0:26:20	None
 Yeah.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, we're at a point there.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_01
 But then you also have to have somewhere where you can put your charger near your couch because otherwise you have to...

0:26:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, otherwise.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to turn on the TV.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_01
 Just a small device.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_04
 I think everything has to be like a telephone charger or something.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_03
 And just the cable or even the charger when you can mount it on.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, something like that.

0:26:47	None
 Okay.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_04
 It's easy to use also.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_04
 Or things.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_04
 Marked share speaker speech recognition.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_03
 Partial designs for the elderly.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_03
 You could make it possible to enlarge the screen.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_03
 To make it possible to not display a button at 10 points.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_04
 I think this will be standard.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_04
 But I just want to know functions you have to specify.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:27:19	None
 Okay.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_03
 Because we can look at perhaps 40 buttons at the screen but in the elderly only look at two buttons.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_03
 And you say something about speech recognition?

0:27:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's all working.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_03
 12.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, 12.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_04
 12.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_04
 Also, 91% 16 to 25, 26 to 35 years, 76% and 36 to 45 to 35%.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_04
 That's wonderful.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_00
 Then I...

0:27:49	SPEAKER_00
 Even bigger than for LCD.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_01
 Let's do speech.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_03
 Well, let's leave out all the remote controls and just put a microphone on top of the telephone.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_03
 19.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_03
 25.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_01
 You can slap or something.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_03
 Turn volume up.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_03
 Hey, that's not it.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_03
 It's all you look.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_01
 You say the wrong thing.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that should...

0:28:12	SPEAKER_03
 It has to be remote control now.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, remote control.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_01
 Well.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_01
 But they want to talk into the remote control or something.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, why not?

0:28:20	SPEAKER_04
 It's probably much better for speech recognition in remote control.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_01
 So, the thing it says.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_01
 Do we want to implement that?

0:28:28	SPEAKER_04
 I think good LCD screen should be sufficient.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_00
 But when you look at percentages.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it says a lot.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_04
 But...

0:28:35	SPEAKER_03
 Perhaps the option should be...

0:28:36	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, even higher.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_03
 Why not?

0:28:38	SPEAKER_00
 Why not?

0:28:39	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe because of the cost.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_03
 But nobody knows how much.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's better to have LCD screen because in the area of 36 to 45, we have about 30%

0:28:52	SPEAKER_04
 of the market share in our hands. And 55 of those people want LCD screen and 35% speak resolution.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_04
 So I think it's better to keep it with LCD screen.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_00
 Would it be useful to implement both?

0:29:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, with the cost.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_01
 So allow it.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know that it can be done with the cost of 1250.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_01
 If it should be done.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_04
 If it could be done.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_04
 I would do it better.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_01
 But now would you like to implement that?

0:29:23	SPEAKER_01
 I would like to say volume up and then...

0:29:26	SPEAKER_03
 Certain systems already exist, I think.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_01
 Then you also have to have different languages.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_01
 If we go international.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_01
 It's true.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_01
 It's used to do a French and Dutch and English.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_04
 But that should be also common with some software.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_04
 It should be also with LCD screen.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_04
 Because I think it's Chinese.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_04
 It's different written volume.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_04
 It's different written than in...

0:29:46	SPEAKER_04
 So I hear you something.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_01
 You can use icons for the speaker.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_01
 And...

0:29:53	SPEAKER_01
 You have to have better than language.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_01
 For the...

0:29:58	SPEAKER_03
 So you want to...

0:30:00	SPEAKER_03
 It's international.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_04
 What else?

0:30:05	SPEAKER_00
 So no speech organization?

0:30:07	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if it could be done with...

0:30:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_03
 It should be done.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_00
 And then with different languages.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_01
 That should be...

0:30:16	SPEAKER_00
 That's not so difficult.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_03
 I already used several...

0:30:19	SPEAKER_03
 Several voice-operated systems.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_03
 And they are all possible to...

0:30:24	SPEAKER_03
 Now all that.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's difficult.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's difficult to adjust the thing.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_04
 Every language of dialects.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's very different.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_01
 I have to speak so that you can understand.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_04
 I think it can be implemented.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_04
 But maybe...

0:30:40	SPEAKER_01
 You could use that as an option.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, an option.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_04
 Money left for some.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_04
 50 euros.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_01
 That's the speed.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_03
 Speed recognition.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_00
 So we only do that when we have enough money left.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I've written down an honor off button.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_00
 Volume selection, channel selection.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_00
 Digits from 1 to 0.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_00
 Or from 0 to 9.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_00
 A digit button to switch between 1 and 2 digits.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_00
 A mute button.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_00
 A separate menu for a TED-Tex.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_00
 A battery indicator.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to use a docking station.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_00
 And probably LCD.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_00
 And if there's enough money, speed recognition.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_00
 And the possibility to enlarge buttons or to have large buttons.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_01
 With the TED-Tex, it wasn't very important.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_01
 But...

0:31:37	SPEAKER_01
 You also know of colors.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if we should implement that.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_01
 Coach?

0:31:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_01
 When you press the red button, you go to page 1 on the 2.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if we should implement that.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_01
 Because it says that TED-Tex not really important.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_01
 Short cuts.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_04
 Short cuts.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_04
 I think we could also implement audio settings, screen settings.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_04
 And channel settings, but at sub menus.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_04
 Mainly if you turn the remote control on, you have to see 1 to 0 channel a volume.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_04
 And if you want to use TED-Tex screen or audio, then you can press it.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_03
 It should be available, but not directly available.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:18	None
 Okay.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_00
 So not too much TED-Tex support, but in a separate menu.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_01
 So actually it is there, but...

0:32:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but it's not really there.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_03
 So there's a few to use.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_03
 We have to be easy to use.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_03
 I'll search.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_03
 If you want to use TED-Tex, you can press TED-Tex button.

0:32:37	SPEAKER_03
 And then the options become available.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's it.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_04
 The design of it.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but no more buttons or functions are...

0:32:47	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_00
 What else can you do with TED-Tex?

0:32:50	SPEAKER_00
 Are we forgetting something?

0:32:52	SPEAKER_01
 I have to cut real examples here, but I don't think there's anything really wrong with it.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_04
 Play POS doesn't need to be...

0:32:59	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, we don't have a video on this.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_04
 The worst is your presentation.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_04
 You could check the other remote controls.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_01
 You could get the POS features.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_04
 Which was...

0:33:11	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_01
 Technical functions.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_01
 They're a bit small, you should stretch them.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_01
 Because...

0:33:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_04
 Technical focus.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_01
 I guess we've got a little...

0:33:26	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, I got you have for even mute play.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, this is actually pretty good.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_04
 For slow...

0:33:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, the zoom buttons.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, white screen, high screen, different things.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, that's even put them on now.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, different.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_01
 But that should also be a sub menu.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it should be available then in sub screen settings or something.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_01
 So we should also implement sub screen settings.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, screen settings, audio settings, analytics settings you have, general settings.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so you can probably...

0:34:02	SPEAKER_01
 So those four end, of course, the main.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_01
 So the first you see the main and the other ones you can go to...

0:34:07	SPEAKER_04
 Like depth screens or something, or...

0:34:10	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_01
 I hope we can do this.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_03
 So it's depending on what kind of television you got.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_03
 Because if you don't have a white screen television,

0:34:20	SPEAKER_04
 you don't need to be a screen-saving thing for... You don't use it.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_03
 And if the television does not support such operations...

0:34:28	SPEAKER_01
 You don't have to use that tab.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_04
 So you leave it.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_04
 Hello.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_04
 Or it could be possible to have a standard version of the remote.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_04
 Expand its version.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_01
 And do we want them in different colors?

0:34:42	SPEAKER_01
 Or...

0:34:44	SPEAKER_01
 And the buttons to change colors?

0:34:46	SPEAKER_03
 The colors, I think, the main color of the remote control is the color of the LCD screen.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, you can use the device itself.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_04
 How many percent?

0:34:56	SPEAKER_04
 80 percent.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's up here.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_03
 We'll spend more money if it looks fancy.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_03
 Very... a lot of people...

0:35:02	SPEAKER_01
 Perhaps you can make adjustable front.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_01
 Like with it.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_01
 I just want to farm this.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_01
 You can...

0:35:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_01
 But I think that...

0:35:12	SPEAKER_03
 Well, make it a bit of a different color.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_03
 Red, white, blue, black.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_03
 A rustical...

0:35:22	SPEAKER_03
 She's blue.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_03
 Same-sensversion.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_04
 She pressed a button.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, leave.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_00
 Well.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_00
 5 minutes.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_00
 Single for our final 5 minutes.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_00
 So I have the things I just read.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_00
 Then we have separate menus for data text, screen settings, audio settings, and what else?

0:35:44	SPEAKER_04
 Channel settings?

0:35:46	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_00
 You can program this to here.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_01
 Perhaps you should...

0:35:54	SPEAKER_01
 You throw them in one pile.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_01
 And then you set them.

0:35:58	SPEAKER_01
 Otherwise you have all those text, perhaps, still text.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_01
 Not...

0:36:02	SPEAKER_04
 Or like...

0:36:04	SPEAKER_04
 Or like a menu button.

0:36:06	SPEAKER_04
 Or a separate menu.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_04
 Or a menu button.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_04
 Or a menu button.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_00
 Or a menu button.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_00
 They have main usage audio settings.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. But we can work it out later.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_00
 So we're having a general menu with the most used functions.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_00
 Data text, screen settings, audio settings, channel settings.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_00
 And maybe there are options for the remote itself.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_00
 Like large icons or small icons.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_04
 I think...

0:36:30	SPEAKER_04
 Because we don't have a lot of buttons on one screen.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_04
 We don't have any buttons.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but...

0:36:36	SPEAKER_04
 We have our left channel button, the volume button, those buttons.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_04
 And we have all the else in here.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_02
 It's also the ELCD, right?

0:36:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_04
 So we don't have any normal buttons.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_04
 No, normal buttons.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe only the...

0:36:52	SPEAKER_00
 That remote itself.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_00
 No. No.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_01
 Or well, you should be able to set which TV you have.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sure. Of course you need the settings button.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_03
 Or settings option for the remote control.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_01
 But there's an idea to use what you said.

0:37:12	SPEAKER_01
 Normal on and off button for the TV.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, no.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_04
 Because we discussed that you could charge it.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_04
 Otherwise it...

0:37:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but not for the remote, but for the TV.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, the TV of course.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_04
 I think that's the best thing is that we implement that one in the menu with the volume.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_00
 But not as normal button in here.

0:37:34	SPEAKER_00
 Well, maybe there should be a separate button apart from the LC.

0:37:36	SPEAKER_00
 Because you can't turn it on when the LCV is off.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_00
 So how do you turn the thing on?

0:37:42	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, you just tap remote.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, just tap it.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_00
 That's the screen thing.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, remote.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_04
 No, just remote.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_04
 Tell if you don't have to be on.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_04
 That's why you can press on.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it should be in standby mode.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, then by the press and remote press on and then TV should be.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_01
 Affailable.

0:38:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:04	None
 Or not.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know whether it's handy to have a normal on button.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_01
 Just remember for TV so you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_01
 Otherwise you...

0:38:10	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know whether or not it's...

0:38:12	SPEAKER_03
 A normal button on the remote control.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, or normal.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_01
 Or you should put it in the SD screen.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because when you touch the SD screen when it is in standby mode, it should pop on.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's right.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_03
 Why would it be handy to have an on button?

0:38:32	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I guess if you use the SD screen, you first have to search where the on button and then you then turn it and then the TV goes on.

0:38:40	SPEAKER_01
 But if you have a normal on button on the remote, then you do it on and then you search the channel that you want.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but I think the remote control if you press step the screen, it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button, channel button and of course also the other off button.

0:39:00	SPEAKER_03
 I think it looks a lot more fancy.

0:39:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think so too.

0:39:04	SPEAKER_00
 I don't have any buttons on.

0:39:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, no buttons.

0:39:08	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well that might be a unique setting point.

0:39:12	SPEAKER_00
 If we can afford it, I guess.

0:39:16	SPEAKER_00
 I was born for the discussion to our next meeting because we're running out of time.

0:39:22	SPEAKER_00
 For now, we're having a lunch break.

0:39:24	SPEAKER_00
 And then there will be half an hour for the next share of individual work.

0:39:30	SPEAKER_00
 I will write minutes if I can create them out of this.

0:39:35	SPEAKER_00
 And put them in the project documents folder and here are the individual actions for the other roles.

0:39:43	SPEAKER_00
 And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your personal coach.

0:39:47	SPEAKER_00
 Luckily, as we are.

0:39:49	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well, thank you very much.

0:39:51	SPEAKER_00
 Lunch.

0:39:53	SPEAKER_00
 Have a nice lunch.

0:39:55	SPEAKER_04
 Food.

0:39:59	SPEAKER_01
 Should we put this back in our room?

0:40:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think so.

0:40:05	None
 Yeah.

0:40:07	None
 Yeah.

0:40:09	None
 Yeah.

0:40:11	None
 Yeah.

0:40:13	None
 Oh yeah.

0:40:15	None
 Thanks.

0:40:17	None
 Oh, sorry.

0:40:21	None
 Yeah.

0:40:25	None
 Yeah.

0:40:35	SPEAKER_04

0:40:39	None

0:40:49	None

0:40:53	None
