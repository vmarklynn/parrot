0:00:00	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, here we go.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_05
 So I definitely have to leave it through 30 today.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_05
 We're definitely have to go to T.

0:00:09	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, they're having birthday cake and so I can't miss that.

0:00:13	SPEAKER_05
 I'm a May birthday, yeah.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_05
 So I've told me.

0:00:15	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_06
 I'm okay.

0:00:20	SPEAKER_03
 So, only a couple of agenda items since no one sent me email for agenda items.

0:00:25	SPEAKER_03
 The first is the IBM transcripts.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_03
 I'd like to mention, I spoke with several of you about this, but just brainstorm a little bit of what we can do with it.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_03
 So we got back the IBM transcript and the accuracy looks okay.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_03
 There are, I mean, there are areas which are clearly wrong and there are a lot of areas where they put question marks where the acoustics weren't very good.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_03
 And I think that's fine.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_03
 Putting question marks is better than doing it wrong.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_03
 The big problem was they had the wrong number of beeps in it.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_03
 Oops.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_03
 So it didn't align.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_03
 And that's exactly what I was afraid of.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_03
 And I went in and more or less by hand corrected it by loading it.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_03
 I wrote a script that will convert it to the multi-channel trans format.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_03
 Looked it in channel trans and found the places where it got unsynchronized.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_03
 And then either, in this case, only had to remove beeps because that was always the error.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_03
 Is that they put it in extraneous beeps.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_03
 But it's not easy to do because the whole thing gets offset and basically it's assigning the wrong speaker to the text and it all gets on the line.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_03
 So it's very difficult to do.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_03
 So it took me several hours just to do that.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_05
 Just one hour of speech.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_05
 And a few hours to do that.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_03
 It took me a couple hours to write the scripts and then it probably took me maybe 45 minutes just going through it.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_03
 Now obviously it will be a lot faster from now on because now I sort of understand how it works.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_03
 But I think if we had some way, some tool that made it easier to insert and delete beeps, it would make it a lot easier.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_03
 Because one of the problems is that it takes a very long time when you make a change to load it back up in the channel transcribe.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_01
 I've noticed that.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_04
 One of the things that I've said that I thought would be a good idea would be if we used different beeps.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_04
 So for example, if we alternated between two beeps, a high and a low.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_04
 Well, into me mail.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't just say that.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_03
 Because then.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_03
 So this is the other approach, which is what do we do in the future to try to make this less common.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_03
 But it's still going to happen.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_01
 Well, then the other possibility was that we provide them with a file that already has a beeps in it or something.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_04
 Sort of a text template, but I don't know how.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_03
 We don't know what their process is.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_03
 So I had two ideas. The first was to provide them a text template that had both the beeps in it and the speaker IDs.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_03
 You know, just mail, female, English, non-English, one, two, three, four.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_03
 And they just filled it in.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_05
 How many beeps are there and how many do it where they were off?

0:02:56	SPEAKER_03
 It was like 120 and they had 123 or something like that.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_03
 And it seems a lot more than that.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I don't remember.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_03
 It was three off.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, and it was a hundredish.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_05
 So if you get one off, everything's off because of the letter, right?

0:03:14	SPEAKER_05
 Yep.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_05
 And this is all in one file that's continuing.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_05
 So I just make it multiple files.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_05
 How would that help?

0:03:20	SPEAKER_05
 Because then if they have one off, then it would only screw up that file.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, you mean just break the one hour into a few chunks?

0:03:27	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, it seems like if you just make one mistake, then everything is off.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_04
 So the only question about that that I have is, I think Brian has to put all this stuff onto a tape.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_04
 So I don't know whether I'm sure they would send them.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_04
 I guess you could send them multiple tapes.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, just say, okay, there's 10 sentences.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, maybe there's other things to do that are more clever, but this just seems to be sort of the obvious thing.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_05
 Because again, if you make one mistake, then everything after that mistake is off.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_04
 And will the only other issue we have to worry about reassembling them in the proper order?

0:04:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, just naming schemes, we'll get, we can definitely do that.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_03
 So one question is, are there good places in the files where we can really do that?

0:04:13	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the other thing makes it so someone will have to go through and listen to them and make a place to break them.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_00
 The other thing you can do, this is on the mix signal, are these the individual?

0:04:25	SPEAKER_00
 The ones with the beeps that they're getting, that they made mistakes on is...

0:04:29	SPEAKER_03
 They are plates from the individual.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_00
 If it's individual, we can probably run a forced alignment where you include the beeps as words, and pretty much figure out where the errors are.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think we could do it on the mix signal, because it, but on the individual channels, that would probably work if they have enough words in the transcript.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we, in fact, that's pretty quick to run.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_00
 We could try it, because if a beep is treated as a...

0:05:03	SPEAKER_03
 You mean, so actually put the wave file in with beep in it, and have a beep model.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_00
 Well, the beep model, actually, you could train a beep model, that's a good idea.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_00
 It would be very good.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, it would be.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_03
 It's very, very regular.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, so...

0:05:18	SPEAKER_05
 Kind of low variance, wouldn't it?

0:05:19	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I'm very concerned.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I'm very concerned.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, that might actually work, because I guess the trick is figuring out where it doesn't align.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_00
 But if it's a problem of extra beeps, rather than missing beeps, then that's easier.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_04
 It could be some missing ones.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_03
 But it's just in this case, they were not.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_03
 So I think Chuck had a good explanation for it, which I liked, which is they're listening to it, and so they write something down.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_03
 Let's say they miss it, they rewind.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_03
 Well, they hear the beep again.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_03
 Was that beep, or was that a different beep?

0:05:54	SPEAKER_03
 So that's why Chuck was suggesting different tones.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_03
 My original thought was you could have a different tone for each speaker.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_03
 There's plenty of tone space, and that might help cue the transcriptionist, give him a little cue about where they are.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_05
 Or you could have a sending tones or something.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_04
 What do you mean?

0:06:14	SPEAKER_04
 Increasingly high frequency.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_00
 Each speaker in the meeting say beep and record it at one point.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_05
 I think I do know if you have a hundred or something, just sort of move them up a half tone or something for each one.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_03
 That's what I was saying, is that you could have each speaker.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_03
 You could have their own tone.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_03
 And since there are no more than 10 speakers or so per meeting, there's plenty of tone space.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, yeah.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_05
 So that might work, too.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I was just thinking, actually, temporarily, just an increasing tone.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_05
 So that they would really have a sense of whether they were going forward or backward or.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_01
 So just truly, chromatically up, follow through the entire meeting.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_01
 Interesting.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, it'd be impossible to miss order them.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_00
 But I guess you'd still get the mistake that you mentioned because the person, I mean, if that's some of the errors, those would probably stay the same.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_00
 Regardless.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, Chuck's suggestion of just two beeps is nice, because then you could have them actually transcribe HB for LB, pi beep or low beep.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_04
 And then when we get them back, if we see two LBs, that's probably better.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you have like scratch my other idea.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_00
 Sounded each check.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_00
 That's a good idea, alternating.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_04
 And it seems like it would help them, you know, if they just finished a long passage and they heard one beep and then they hear it again, they know it's the same beep versus if they heard it.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's a good error checking.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I do do one for each person in the meeting.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_03
 You can only hire people with perfect pitch and they're a flat.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_03
 That was great.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_05
 Great idea.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_05
 Now two is probably better than when I was suggesting, because what I was suggesting, in order to make a through a reasonable range for the whole thing, you'd have to have the tonal differences between the two kind of small and actually what the large.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_01
 You have to have the acoustics of dogs.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_01
 You're right.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_03
 So I think certainly doing two beeps is no brainer.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_03
 And then the other question is if they can, if they do something on a computer in a format we can handle, we could give them a text file that was a template with speaker ID and beeps already in it.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_03
 And then they could just fill that in.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe I should write to Brian and tell him what the problem was and what our proposed solutions are.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_04
 See what he thinks would work best with them.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, what's going wrong in the other end?

0:08:32	SPEAKER_05
 What are they doing?

0:08:33	SPEAKER_03
 Well, as I said, I think we don't actually know, but I think Chuck's hypothesis was a good one, which is you listen to something, you write down what you thought you heard, but you want to listen to it against who you rewind.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_03
 And then you hear the beep again and you say, well, is that that beep or is that a new beep?

0:08:47	SPEAKER_03
 I don't remember.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_03
 And so, you know, a couple times they got it wrong.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_04
 And there are some cases where there's very little speech before you hear a beep.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_04
 So here, a little bit of speech beep, a little bit of speech beep.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe three of those in a row was at three beeps, was at two beeps.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_04
 So they have the, Brian said the setup that they have is they've got headphones, and I guess they have a computer, and they have a foot pedal, which lets them quickly scan back and forth through the tape.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_04
 It makes the tape go real fast forward or fast backward.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_04
 And so they can hear something, then step on the pedal and quickly rewind and go back in here again.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_04
 And so they're, I think they're probably going over and over sections, and then they get confused about whether they already put that beep or if they heard, you know, three beeps in a row, was at three or two.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_01
 It's a shame we can't really give a number.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_01
 So it would be a number and a beep.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_01
 It's a shame we can't do that.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that's an interesting idea.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_03
 We could, but then that starts getting pretty long.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, no, but wait, maybe what we have instead of a beep is a synthesized number, and they put the number in when they hear it.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_04
 So placing the beep with 23, 24, and then they have to transcribe what that number is each time.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_01
 Wow, that also be shorter than time.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, just a two, three, two, four, that way.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_04
 Well, they would have to have a mark.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_04
 Be some kind of mark in front of it.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_05
 Well, because there's distinguishing between 23, that's your indicator there and 23 that somebody happens to say.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it would have to be either obviously a sounding synthesized.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_04
 They might miss that, right?

0:10:28	SPEAKER_01
 Or maybe it could be a quick and a number.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_04
 Or a beep in the number.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it's sequential.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_03
 And then you just do the number.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_03
 Right, you go sequential.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_03
 So unless you got pretty unlucky, what the person was saying and the number.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_04
 In fact, we could put it at the beginning of each other.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_04
 We could say beep one, and then they'll hear the speed.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_05
 I think having a beep too is good.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_03
 So beep number.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_03
 Or a number beep.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_03
 It's just getting pretty long.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_03
 You know, the other answers are very short.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_03
 And so you're going to be talking beep number.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, beep number.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if it saves time.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, and I think it would actually happen.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_03
 And when they transcribe this meeting, it's going to be really impossible.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_03
 We're saying beep.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, yeah, for instance.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_04
 But see, that would definitely keep.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_04
 It's not a bad idea.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, keep things from getting out of sequence.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_04
 If they heard it over again, they would know it would be obvious from their transcript, whether they did that one or not.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_03
 That would help get them synchronized.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_01
 It might be helpful to them in terms of.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_01
 I think it would be.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_03
 And we have plenty of digit data.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_03
 So yeah.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_03
 They would know their place, darn it.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_03
 It was transcriptionists need to know their place.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_05
 It sounds like a short conversation with Brian.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_05
 It might be helpful to get a sense of it.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the numbers are a good idea.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_03
 And then, I think the transcript, I think it would be very helpful.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_02
 Just instead of the sequential number, perhaps just a speaker idea or something, just say, speaker one or just one, two, three, four, four speakers or something, it could be helpful.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you don't have to, you could keep them short or just go one through ten, one through ten or one through twenty.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_01
 And then also, I mean, I don't know what their set up is, but your template idea might be a way of, we could actually build the numbers into a template.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_04
 I'll talk to Brian.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, single digit numbers that also appeals to me so that you don't have to, you know, one hundred twenty four.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_03
 Well, even one thousand, three hundred forty two.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_05
 You're saying it's about an hour meeting and there were hundred and twenty-three.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_03
 I don't remember.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_03
 It's a track we're saying there was more than that, four beeps than that.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_04
 I was thinking there was only order of fifteen hundred segments, but maybe I'm...

0:12:37	SPEAKER_00
 There must be because otherwise you're going to call.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_00
 I think it should be more than that.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_00
 That was at least forty five minutes, right?

0:12:43	SPEAKER_00
 That's right.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_00
 Was it that?

0:12:45	SPEAKER_00
 I just don't recall.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 That's the shortest meeting we have.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_00
 Most of them are double ladder.

0:12:48	None
 Yep.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I was just wondering what the average length of a segment they're hearing.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_00
 No, no.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_03
 Easy enough to figure out.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_00
 So if there are in the hundredth and that were thousands of these, there must be in the high hundreds of them at least.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_00
 That's getting a little cumbersome for them to tie it up.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_00
 I would just one five.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_00
 But yeah, if they recycled for...

0:13:12	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, if it didn't mod ten.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_05
 My point was, you know, it's a big difference to me if there's a thousand of those hundred.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_05
 If there's a thousand, then that means that this is only happening three times out of a thousand, which means even just splitting it up into a few files, we'd probably take nearly all the time there would be no.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_05
 If it's a hundred, then that's not the issue, but if it's a hundred, then the average length of each one is pretty, pretty long, and so having a little thing at the front of it is no big deal.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_05
 So you're right.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_03
 It's what's curious.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_03
 More than that.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, it was a 45 minute meeting.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_03
 And it certainly was not a minute of chunk.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_03
 It was a few seconds of chunk.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_00
 That's what I...

0:13:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so I'm just going to survive.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm just going to go overhead to type.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just missing remembering.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_01
 Well, and the other thing is maybe the numbers would help them keep their place in the transcriptions.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_03
 It might make the transcript faster.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I mean, I...

0:13:57	SPEAKER_03
 Quick conversation with Brian would be good.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_03
 Another of that.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, if it is...

0:14:12	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it's not a bad idea to try the alignment.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_00
 If there's only like three of them, then if you align, the first point at which things get messed up is sort of the location of the first problem.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_00
 And then the second... I mean, you could do it that way.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_00
 It would be able to handle any errors.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_00
 So if they make on the average that many, and it costs them more time to do something different than what they're doing, which I don't know.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_00
 But if it does, then you could try doing it as a post-process.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_00
 And have a student or a transcriber run this alignment, or we could do it.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_00
 You know, actually, what all we would...

0:14:51	SPEAKER_00
 And then we could iteratively figure out where the problems are.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_00
 You know, there's always...

0:14:56	SPEAKER_00
 It's like a little work, but not any real human.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, that's what we want to do.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_04
 In terms of the alignment, actually, all we would need is...

0:15:02	SPEAKER_04
 We wouldn't even need words.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_04
 We would need a general speech model and a beep model.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_04
 Because all we're really concerned about is missing beeps or too many beeps.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_00
 Well, of course, the forced alignment will run fat.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_00
 Otherwise, it'll take forever.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, to really run regular things.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I guess what I'm thinking of is that a lot of times, there will be... they'll put in question marks that represent some unknown amount of speech.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_04
 So we're going to have to have some kind of...

0:15:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, then we just map it to a reject model.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_00
 And in fact, that's what we do now.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_00
 Because it's even after Jane listens where we have an expert, can't even tell what they're talking about.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_00
 So that's okay.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_00
 We just map that to a reject model.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_04
 But what I was thinking is map all the speech to the reject model.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_04
 And then you have a beep model.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so talking, of course, still...

0:15:45	SPEAKER_00
 The forced alignment might not work then, although we can try it.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_00
 Well, but all the beeps...

0:15:49	SPEAKER_05
 Well, the beep model is what's really...

0:15:51	SPEAKER_05
 You'd have really good...

0:15:52	SPEAKER_05
 The beep model is really nice.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_04
 We really do match.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_05
 So it's really just doing a keyword like a spotting for beep with...

0:15:57	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to edit it all, grab the next beep in other words.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_00
 It'll be... you'll get back another offset.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, let's think of that.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_00
 And then I realize, well, recognize we'll just go along and line up all the beeps.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_00
 And then there'll be all the extra beeps at the end if there were more beeps than you want it.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_00
 So you need the word...

0:16:14	SPEAKER_00
 So you need the word to...

0:16:15	SPEAKER_04
 To tell it we're a call it wrong.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not suggesting that we don't have anything between the beeps.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_04
 Oh.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_04
 But what I'm saying is what's between the beeps we don't really care about.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_00
 I think you do care about it.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_00
 Unless you want to know if they're...

0:16:29	SPEAKER_00
 Otherwise, you just count up the total number of...

0:16:32	SPEAKER_03
 And we could do that with word count.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_03
 Right, we already know that we're three short.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_03
 And so if we just did...

0:16:38	SPEAKER_03
 Speak beep and non-beap, all you would get is that you have three mistakes, but you wouldn't tell you which ones were wrong.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_03
 You need some of the words in there so that you can say, well, this segment matches this one, this segment matches this one, and this one doesn't match at all unless we insert a beep.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_00
 And the only thing I'm worried about with that approach is that if we need to figure out the beep alignment problem before the transcribers do the corrections here, then we're in trouble.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_00
 In other words, if the transcripts aren't sort of good enough that the aligner constraints are good enough to sort of show you where the errors are, then it wouldn't work.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_00
 But it might work.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_00
 It might work to do this if their transcripts are pretty close on the words that usually get recognized correctly, which are the function words.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_03
 Well, actually, you know, there's an even easier way.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_03
 We don't really need a beep model.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_03
 Just extract the segments and do a forced alignment.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_03
 Right, you can say that the score is good if you say it matches.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_00
 Right, the individual segments between the beeps.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_00
 If beeps were like the segments that we get from the transcription tool already, that's what we have done, and it works very well.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_00
 You can see these segments align and these don't.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_00
 Then you just have to go back in and figure out where the endpoints of those segments are because some of them will be wrong.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_00
 Because the beeps were missing by definition.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_00
 So do you get a score for each alignment?

0:18:02	SPEAKER_00
 You get, definitely when they don't align at all, it fails.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, that's how we found a lot of problems before with words being on the wrong place or something.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_00
 So a fail alignment is a very good indicator that the words don't match up.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_04
 And just wondering what it means to fail.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_04
 Is it the likelihood scores below some threshold?

0:18:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's a, right.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_00
 You can't match up the, that's why you actually need the text in order to force you to try to match something that gives you a moment.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_00
 So it's just an idea if it turns out that, I mean, I also like this idea of high and low beeps or, but if, suppose we get one or two errors still per, you know, per transcript, then we might want to try some approach like that.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the numbered ones would make it a lot easier because you could then really localize where the, right.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_00
 So if that doesn't add time for them, it'd be great.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I think we'll just ask them.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_05
 Again, especially if there's 100, many hundreds or thousands, I still think it would cut the incidence of this lot if it was possible to break it into a couple of files.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_05
 Because it, you know.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_00
 I guess also even for the transcribers, it's quicker to load a smaller file.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I mean, we could certainly break the meat. We could certainly break 20-inch pieces.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_05
 And we've already broken them into chunks. So if you have a thousand chunks, then just accumulate it to get 10 things per 100 or, you know, that's true.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_05
 And then it would be, you know, every now and then it'll be a, a beep missing.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_01
 So someone's going to talk to Brian.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_03
 I think that was Chuck.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_01
 I also looked over the text and I was impressed by the accuracy. It looks really good.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it does look good. I found several errors, but they were not significant.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_03
 They were all things that I could easily listen to.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_03
 And sometimes convince myself they said one thing and sometimes the other.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_00
 I haven't looked at these because I was gone last week.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_00
 But, but Don had told me that there's a difference in some of the conventions.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yes.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_00
 But those are all easy things, right?

0:20:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_01
 And Brian actually forwarded me in advance. He worked very nicely, worked out, set a convention which is intermediate between ours and the ones that they're used to.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_00
 Which is really a good, so we can just map them.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_00
 It'll talk great.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_03
 We still haven't really sat down and talked about file reorganization and directory reorganization.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_03
 So we still have to do that.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_03
 But I don't think we need to do that in this meeting.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_03
 But it is something that needs to get done.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_03
 And I want to also coordinate it with Dave so that we do a level zero back up right after.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_03
 So we don't waste a lot of tapes.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_03
 So let's try to do that sometime.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_03
 We also still have to make a decision about my issues.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_03
 What we want to do with that.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_01
 I thought we were going to get two more of the.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_03
 And just swap them in and out.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we could certainly do that.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_02
 So one note.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_03
 So Morgan, just to.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_03
 I think you weren't at the meeting last week.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_00
 Apparently a bunch of the EDU folks really hate this style might.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_00
 Well, they didn't say hate, but they.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_03
 They come on time to their meetings in order to not be left the last person who has to sit by us.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_03
 That's that's a fairly strong indication of dislike.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_00
 Which one is the crowd?

0:21:49	SPEAKER_03
 The people you like three or four people who really like them and all the others.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_03
 And the number of the Sony ones and just unplug them and plug them in.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_03
 The only thing is that when you fill out the digit forms, you have to be sure to indicate which mic was actually used.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_03
 So that's easy to do.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_03
 It moves us away from this uniform.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_03
 All the mics are the same, which some people had said was a benefit.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_01
 The other thing too is you said that the acoustic quality of the one that you're wearing, the fancy one is actually somewhat better than.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_01
 It is.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_01
 So I don't know if it's a noticeable difference, but it is.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_01
 I personally really prefer that model.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_01
 So I think we've got this problem of people having different.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_05
 You know, there are so many things about this that are not uniform.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_05
 I think having some modicum of uniformity is a good thing, but you're just not going to.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, we've.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_05
 For instance, just the fact that people sit in different positions, different times.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_05
 Exactly where they put it with respect to their mouth is different each time.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_05
 I just don't.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, I think we're getting rid of major differences.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_05
 Like we're not using the lapel anymore and so forth, but the other stuff is just going to.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_05
 Some very ability we're going to have to accept.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_01
 I understand.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_01
 It's fun.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_01
 I would say that I find this model easier to adjust.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_01
 That's one of the reasons I don't like these because I keep bending it.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I happen to like the old one better, but yeah, what about just a different headband thing?

0:23:19	SPEAKER_00
 Or even if we can attach two headband like we have lots of choices of microphones.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_00
 So I mean, can we keep the microphones and just somehow attach a more comfortable thing over your head?

0:23:33	SPEAKER_00
 That's my problem with this one.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_00
 The ear thing comes out to here.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't even fit over my ear.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_00
 For some of the others, their ears were shaped in a way that didn't hold the...

0:23:45	SPEAKER_03
 So we can go microphone shopping and get more microphones.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure what we should do.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, here's another argument against worrying too much about uniformity.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_05
 We have something like 45 hours of data collected.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_05
 We're also going to be integrating this corpus stuff that's being done at UW with entirely different microphones.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_05
 So I think getting away from the little pal, having close mounted mics, having people adjust them as comfortable as they can...

0:24:15	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I agree with that.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_03
 So my feeling is we should get mics that people like.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_03
 And so my feeling is going out and buying a few more mics is fine.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_03
 So should I just go do that?

0:24:27	SPEAKER_03
 And then also should we go ahead and get another wireless system for whatever it's going to be?

0:24:35	SPEAKER_05
 Another wireless system.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_05
 You mean another transmitter?

0:24:39	SPEAKER_03
 No, actually we need another box because each box in the back room can only take six.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, to get rid of the wired things.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_05
 Yes, absolutely.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_05
 With the exception of forgetting the chains, the batteries from time to time, we've really had no trouble with this at all.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_05
 And the wired stuff is just going to continue to degrade.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_05
 Nobody will remember how to repair a gym box or a gym let.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, then I will just go do that and send the bill to whoever will pay.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_00
 I have a quick question about microphones.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_00
 I got this crazy idea that in the future people will just walk around with the microphones that they use for their cell phones, you know, these little boom ones, like, and really go to meetings with close talking mics if they're their own personal microphone.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_00
 And so I'm wondering if we can get a couple though.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know how good quality there are, but it would be really interesting to see if they're good enough.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_00
 Do you mean the kind of hang from the ear or something?

0:25:43	SPEAKER_00
 They kind of guys that like to look like they're really cool at airports.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I don't know that one.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_05
 It's a cell phone.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah, you do.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_00
 You cannot know that.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_00
 They're probably talking to nobody.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_00
 They have little headsets or what are they?

0:25:59	SPEAKER_00
 They wear the heads.

0:26:01	None
 Well, there you go.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, that looks sort of like that.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_03
 That one's even bigger than most of the ones I've seen.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_05
 So where does the mic go?

0:26:07	SPEAKER_01
 How do you wear that?

0:26:09	SPEAKER_05
 You put it over the corner of your ear.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_01
 I'm having a microphone, a headphone problem here.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_04
 There's another kind which goes in your ear and it hangs down.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_04
 There's a little bit of that I've seen here.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so whatever people sort of wear to use, yeah, something like with their cell phones, it'd be really great.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_00
 I think if we can argue to that.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_00
 It's interesting to see people who like that.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_01
 The acoustics on this are really better than when I talk into it directly.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the biggest issue is the stupid cable that Sony, the connector that Sony has, it's non-standard and so you can't just plug something in.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_03
 You need to get it wide.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, I'm sorry. You're talking about that as a possible thing to plug into the Sony's.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_00
 Just as an example for the future of the fact that maybe people will wear those microphones or some people might to meet.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_00
 Well, some people will, yeah.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not saying there's not a far-filed microphone application, but I always wondered how well they would work.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_04
 It is an interesting idea.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_04
 I think the building adapter that went from, because I think mine looks like this too, with this dial plug that went to that, right, then we just have adapters and people plug them in.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_03
 You could use the...

0:27:15	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if you can or not.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_03
 It's just an idea.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I mean, another is be a better idea than redoing the wiring all the time.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_05
 Another side of that is that in principle, if it all comes together, supposedly we're going to get two iran boards, a little later on in the year.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_05
 And so we're going to want to be thinking in terms of some wireless connection to it.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_05
 So we have some kind of little something.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_05
 And we have a wireless connection.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_05
 This board is doing the computation for the recognition.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_05
 And so we want to be able to show off to somebody.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_05
 We have a base station somewhere, and you're wandering around hands-free.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_04
 I don't understand. So there's a mic that plugs into the iran board?

0:28:03	SPEAKER_05
 No. No. What I'm saying is that we're going to have to put together some kind of a little superstructure, some sort of demo box that doesn't do a whole lot, but it somehow connects to remotely to this iran board, which will be doing the real computation.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, nice.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_05
 No, we're not going to attempt to build...

0:28:23	SPEAKER_05
 Do the real work of building a portable device that's little that is doing all the computation we want to do for the recognition and the far-field-like compensation and all that stuff.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_05
 So we're going to do all that on this powerful board.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_05
 And have some wireless connection to it.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_05
 And then the question is, what does it look like?

0:28:43	SPEAKER_05
 Does it look like something that you hold like this, or do we make a big deal out of it that you hold it at arms length so that you can see some display, or do we have one of these?

0:28:55	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know. So it's these are all possibilities.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_03
 What I was envisioning was a PDA with a cellular link and with one of the short-range wireless.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_03
 Just to capture the audio on the PDA and set the audio over the wireless net.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah. Bluetooth sort of thing.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_03
 Bluetooth is shorter range, but you could use Bluetooth.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_03
 Whatever the network guys already have hooked up for this floor, I don't remember what it's called.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, then another issue on file reorganization is making data available to people outside XC.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_03
 So specifically the UW folks have been wanting to get access to it.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_03
 So I think the right thing to do for that is figure out how to do CVS without compromising security.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_03
 Some SSH tunneled CVS.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I'll give them access.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_04
 I was reading through some of the CVS documentation and you can just substitute CVS for your RSH command.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, except that the command has to not take a password because it's non-interactive.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_03
 And so the only way to do that is with S-host switches and secure.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_03
 So we still have to sort of look at it a little bit.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I'm sure it's been solved and I just haven't found the solution yet.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_03
 It's going to be a problem a lot of people have.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_05
 Well, we're talking about fairly limited group.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_05
 Is it a small enough group that they could just have accounts?

0:30:29	SPEAKER_03
 Not really because then we have the coordination issue.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, so one thing they could do, I mean, I guess that's true.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_03
 They could simply log into XC.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, they're going to have to have everything locally.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_04
 If they use SSH, they have to have an account.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, except they could share one.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_03
 The SSH accounts and the user accounts don't have to be similar.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_03
 So, I mean, there are lots of ways of doing it.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_03
 But if we can't figure out a remote way of doing it, just letting them log into XC might be okay.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_03
 So the intention was to put everything except the audio files themselves under revision control.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_03
 And the audio files, it's not worth doing because they're too big.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_03
 You're never going to be copying them around and making working copies of them.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_03
 And then the other issue, Jane and I spoke of briefly, is just general permission issues.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_03
 That right now lots of people create the files and then we have group meeting recorder.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_03
 But that means anyone in the meeting recorder group can overwrite the files.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_03
 And so that's pretty coarse level of granularity.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_03
 So we might want to think about doing a meeting recorder user owner for those files.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_03
 And then doing group slightly differently.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_03
 But I think what we have now.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_00
 I think what we have now.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, if you just have one user that...

0:31:50	SPEAKER_03
 Another option is to make a non-make it owned by a not real user.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_03
 And then only root will be able to do it.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_03
 But root is pretty tightly controlled here.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_03
 So I don't think that's a good solution.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_01
 There are scripts that run and when it's finished compressing, would it be possible for the script to change the permissions on the file to be more straight?

0:32:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, but if you do that then someone who isn't the owner can't unchange it.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_01
 But after the meeting's done, would they want to?

0:32:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, as I said, it's just a question of, do you want to have to track down root if you have to make any change?

0:32:32	SPEAKER_00
 But it doesn't have to be root. It could be some other user that we all can SUX too.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, security issues with that.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_00
 I mean...

0:32:43	SPEAKER_04
 So we do with doctor speech though, right?

0:32:45	SPEAKER_03
 No, with doctor speech it's just a group.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_03
 So there are lots of different owners of the files, but the group is always doctor speech or real usually.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_04
 But there is a user doctor speech, right?

0:32:57	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I SUX to doctor speech.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, do you?

0:33:00	SPEAKER_04
 Well, that's what I meant.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_00
 A directory on that.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_00
 User like meeting root or something.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_00
 I know.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I'm not too worried because the group is pretty small.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_03
 But yeah.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_01
 It also seems like once it's been stored that night, it's possible to recover from backups.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_01
 So the main risk is avoiding it being accidentally deleted during the day that it was recorded.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you then also just have the general problem of permission on the other files.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_03
 Do you want people checking out a transcript file when they find an error and correcting it, or do you want it to go through you?

0:33:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_01
 And I prefer it to go through me.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_03
 If that means that you're going to have to be available for people all the time who say there's an error here, rather than just them just going in and correcting it.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it's CVS, though. You don't actually have to do it that way.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_03
 Well, but you have a choice.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_03
 Either you let people do it themselves or you don't.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_04
 What I'm saying is that it can be the case that people can do it themselves and it can be reviewed.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_04
 Right?

0:34:11	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, it's not like it's one or the other.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_06
 We can do both.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you can do both.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_03
 So you can get email.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_03
 Send email to Jane that someone has done a, right?

0:34:21	SPEAKER_01
 I want to also say that, you know, this is my view on this is that once it's in a file, once it's in a final version and I'm working toward all these final versions, then it can go into this next row, this next row, but it's sort of counterproductive to have changes made, which I would be making if I just got in that far on the file.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_03
 You know, it's, it's, well, so you don't have to release it to the world until you're ready to.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_03
 That's right.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_03
 So the question is, so you would keep it in a separate file structure until you were ready to put it in the repository.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_00
 Or just keep the lock on.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, just keep the lock on.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_00
 Check it out.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_00
 Check it out and don't let anyone check it out.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_00
 No, it doesn't, the CVS doesn't work that way.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, it doesn't.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_04
 There's no, there's no lock when you check something out, not like RCS.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_04
 No, there's everybody can check out anything.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, the C stands for concurrent.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_00
 Why not use RCS at that point?

0:35:10	SPEAKER_00
 Because it's not remote.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_00
 It's not remote.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_03
 The nice thing about CVS is, is you can be on a different machine.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_00
 But at that point, we only want probably Jane to be in control anyway.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_03
 I know because UW wants to have access to these files.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_03
 That's the whole point.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_00
 But not to modify them right, just to read them.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_03
 Well, if they, and if they record a meeting and they'd create a key file and they find an error in their key file, they shouldn't have to tell us about that so that they can create correct an error in one of their files.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_03
 So that's why I want to do it.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_03
 So that's why I want to do it.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, key files different.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_01
 Different than what?

0:35:48	SPEAKER_01
 Well, key file has the extra attributes that if you notice that there are lots of spikes on channel so and so it's useful as a repository for putting it there.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_01
 And also if you notice that there was an extra speaker and didn't get mentioned in the key file, but they were only there for a second, but it's useful to mention that they're there.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_01
 So I think that the key files use it for notations related to the meeting.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_03
 But the meetings are going to be the same way.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_03
 So UW records a meeting.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_03
 We transcribe it.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_03
 A few months later, they listened to it and they say, oh, they got that acronym wrong.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:18	None
 Why?

0:36:18	SPEAKER_00
 Why?

0:36:19	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it's sort of not really question about permissions, but more of procedure.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_00
 Either those all go through Jane or through someone or they all don't.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_00
 But it's sort of, and if they all do, then there isn't a problem, right?

0:36:32	SPEAKER_00
 Because once they give us the data, it's ours.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_00
 And if they want to make change it, I mean, ours to sort of transcribe and annotate.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_03
 And if they want to make change it, it would be nice to be one repository.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_03
 And if we don't let them modify their own data, they're not going to store their data in our repository, or if we make it inconvenient for them to change their data.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_03
 So then if they, you know, I'm just looking at the other way around.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_03
 So let's say we,

0:36:57	SPEAKER_00
 And they use RCS at that point, where you can really lock a file. I mean, I'm worried if you can't lock a file, this to me sounds very scary.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_00
 And if they have accounts here and they're modifying, if they're, if they're so closely linked that they're actually modifying transcripts and key files, then they could do it by, you know, secure shelling into Xe under RCS at that point.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I don't see a real difference between RCS and any other system.

0:37:27	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, it's just mechanisms.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_03
 The nice thing about CVS is that you can have multiple people modifying.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_03
 And if the changes don't overlap each other, they can just do it.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_03
 So the problem with RCS is that if two people want to modify a file at the same time they can't, because the granularity of locking is at the file level.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_05
 What does CVS do if they, if they do overlap?

0:37:50	SPEAKER_03
 There are lots of different policies for dealing with it.

0:37:53	SPEAKER_04
 But typically a person has to mediate, you know, which changes actually get you to go through.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, to go through which one is.

0:38:01	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe there is a way in CVS to effectively lock something.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_00
 If you don't want people to make any changes.

0:38:09	SPEAKER_03
 At the repository level there certainly is.

0:38:11	SPEAKER_03
 You can mark a file as you can't check this out.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, so CVS is pretty good.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_00
 And you can use CVS and, you know, just have remote access.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_00
 But then it's up to whoever is sort of responsible for that level of transcription to decide how and when to put these blocks.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_03
 But it's just like source code, right?

0:38:32	SPEAKER_03
 So that when you're developing it and it's really rough, you don't put it in the repository.

0:38:36	SPEAKER_03
 You wait to the point where you're ready to release it.

0:38:38	SPEAKER_03
 And then you put it in the repository.

0:38:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, so there were other people on there.

0:38:41	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe the model, it's a little bit different.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_04
 CVS, when you check something out, you actually create your own directory with copies of everything in it.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_04
 And that's what you work on.

0:38:50	SPEAKER_04
 So until you're ready to check it in, nobody sees anything you've done.

0:38:54	SPEAKER_04
 And then when you check it in, it puts sort of, you know, every change you've done.

0:38:57	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:38:58	SPEAKER_00
 It goes into the central.

0:38:59	SPEAKER_00
 So if that's, I guess it depends on James, you know, if that's, if that model works for the transcripts, then that's fine.

0:39:08	SPEAKER_00
 But if that allows someone to come in and modify while you're modifying, and they turn out to be changes that, you know, would have better to wait until your version came out then.

0:39:21	SPEAKER_00
 That's really up to you, not up to software.

0:39:23	SPEAKER_01
 I also think that the type of change varies.

0:39:26	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's a very good point because what if the, what if one set of changes, one person was making was with reference to some typographical convention.

0:39:35	SPEAKER_01
 And the other person, quite unknowingly, was changing it the other way around.

0:39:40	SPEAKER_01
 And you could end up with a real mess in terms of like consistency of conventions across a file.

0:39:44	SPEAKER_01
 There is an argument to be made for having a single editor editing at that level.

0:39:47	SPEAKER_01
 Well, yeah, there would have to be somebody to enforce the consistency.

0:39:50	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:39:51	SPEAKER_01
 I also like, this is a phraseology of this level of, I don't remember how you put it, but this at this level of transcription or whatever, it means like they're different layers of whatever and different types of conventions.

0:40:02	SPEAKER_01
 And if it were an acronym, then I would, I think that it would make sense for them to have input into that level of things.

0:40:10	SPEAKER_01
 But I wouldn't want to be changing.

0:40:11	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just, imagine that we reverse this, and they were keeping the repository, and we were collecting meetings and sending them to them.

0:40:17	SPEAKER_03
 If I found an error, and I sent them email and said, here's this error, and I didn't get a response for a couple of weeks, I would stop sending them to my data, and I would start collecting it here, and we would end up with two corpora.

0:40:28	SPEAKER_03
 Well.

0:40:29	SPEAKER_03
 And I don't want that to happen.

0:40:30	SPEAKER_03
 I do.

0:40:31	SPEAKER_03
 So we have to make it convenient for them to make changes that they want to make.

0:40:35	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I see now we're back into the same situation as when we're talking about allowing people to edit the transcripts to become public. This question of how easy or how hard to modify and how that impacts the amount of changing that's done.

0:40:48	SPEAKER_01
 And I think that it's, I have received some suggestions for change which I've made.

0:40:55	SPEAKER_01
 And I think with an acronym, that's a clear case where it would be easy change to incorporate.

0:41:00	SPEAKER_01
 But it would worry me to have people having free reign to change these things because of the need to have consistent conventions and people who are only just visiting the data might not have a sense of a larger system.

0:41:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's what I would be worried about.

0:41:16	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I think there are probably ways that you can say that only certain users are allowed to change things.

0:41:22	SPEAKER_04
 So we can probably restrict it to be casual users, or just browsing can just get it read-only, can't check into the archive, or as we could say other people, these people are allowed to actually submit changes.

0:41:35	SPEAKER_04
 I think one thing that's probably everybody would agree on is that there will never be a point where we can say that for sure there's no problems with any of the transcripts.

0:41:46	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, there's, you know, some things are going to get overlooked at some point, or somebody's going to want to make a change somehow.

0:41:52	SPEAKER_04
 So we need to have some mechanism for handling changes in the future.

0:41:58	SPEAKER_01
 I agree, but I have to also add one other thing which is before I forget it, which is Adam's point about when you were reviewing the IBM transcripts, this is mentioned at the beginning of the meeting, you said that there were some places where it wasn't what was written already, but you could see how they might have thought that's what it said.

0:42:13	SPEAKER_01
 So it's not just a right and wrong thing.

0:42:15	SPEAKER_01
 Sometimes they're true, there are absolutely stresses where there is no, if you were at the meeting and you could ask the person, maybe, you know, they could have told you, but five minutes later they might not have been able to tell you, even if they were listening to it.

0:42:27	SPEAKER_01
 So sometimes it isn't right and wrong, sometimes it's multiple interpretations.

0:42:31	SPEAKER_01
 Good point.

0:42:32	SPEAKER_01
 But of course this does raise the possibility of allowing an extra annotation for, you know, alternative interpretations of a stretch.

0:42:39	SPEAKER_01
 But I just wanted to say it isn't simply right or wrong, or overlooked or not overlooked.

0:42:43	SPEAKER_01
 Sometimes they're truly ambiguous and nice to have a notation for that.

0:42:48	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, I like that idea because even a casual user can always send email to whoever's in charge and say, you know, we'd like these changes and, you know, hopefully we'll give them a response.

0:43:00	SPEAKER_00
 And if they really do it a lot and they say, we're a casual user, but we want a chance to change the transcripts.

0:43:05	SPEAKER_00
 And we can face that.

0:43:07	SPEAKER_00
 You can write 100.

0:43:09	SPEAKER_00
 I don't really see the people at UW that I know of right now making huge, investing huge amounts of time and changing transcripts.

0:43:16	SPEAKER_00
 But it could be wrong.

0:43:17	SPEAKER_03
 We could not transcripts, but it would be nice to have one mechanism for all the files.

0:43:21	SPEAKER_03
 And they're certainly going to want to change tools.

0:43:24	SPEAKER_03
 And so, you know, it's the same as source code.

0:43:26	SPEAKER_03
 You release source code at some point.

0:43:28	SPEAKER_03
 And either you have to do everything or you share responsibility.

0:43:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I mean, a lot of the open source projects face the same problem.

0:43:35	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:43:36	SPEAKER_04
 You know, anybody can check out the code, but not everybody can check it in.

0:43:40	SPEAKER_00
 Right. And there's some happy medium and we don't know what that is yet until we get feedback from people.

0:43:46	SPEAKER_00
 But what if it's okay to just handle it with sort of a person in charge of the philosophy behind it?

0:43:53	SPEAKER_00
 And some people with permissions maybe buy request to make changes.

0:43:57	SPEAKER_00
 That we don't just give people permissions if they're not going to make changes.

0:44:00	SPEAKER_00
 Because I've overwritten a file by mistake not wanting to have done that because I didn't think I had permission when I did.

0:44:07	SPEAKER_00
 And then just seeing if that is enough to handle the transcript changes.

0:44:15	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just worried about letting everybody go in and make changes.

0:44:18	SPEAKER_00
 Because it's really easy when you're trying to run the linements and there's a word you want to fix to go in and do that and then mess up other things.

0:44:27	SPEAKER_00
 If you don't know the overall philosophy behind the conventions.

0:44:32	SPEAKER_04
 There is also the possibility, remember in CBS when we talk about making changes, there's sort of two types that can be made to your local or to the global.

0:44:41	SPEAKER_04
 And so people can make changes to their local and they screw those up.

0:44:44	SPEAKER_04
 Exactly.

0:44:45	SPEAKER_04
 And that's only on them. It's the checking in part that you really care about.

0:44:50	SPEAKER_04
 And that we can control with who can check things in and stuff.

0:44:54	SPEAKER_04
 So I think we can do this.

0:44:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, start by making it a really tight control and then as people really need the control, you can...

0:45:00	SPEAKER_00
 They can still check it out.

0:45:01	SPEAKER_00
 Asher chain weather.

0:45:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because they can still check out full copies and make whatever changes they want to their local copies.

0:45:06	SPEAKER_04
 And it won't affect the global official ones at all.

0:45:10	SPEAKER_03
 But what I want to avoid is ending up with two corpora.

0:45:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yes. And so if you make it too hard for them to check back in, they'll check it out once.

0:45:18	SPEAKER_03
 They'll make all the changes. They'll never tell us about the changes and we'll get two different corpora.

0:45:25	SPEAKER_00
 I think we're already going to...

0:45:27	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, there's already some chance that different annotations, different places, you know.

0:45:32	SPEAKER_00
 But you can control that by knowing you're making two corpora or knowing that you're adding annotations on one version and you don't have the latest corrections maybe at that point.

0:45:43	SPEAKER_00
 And then you finish the project and you realize that there were corrections made on your originals and then you have to merge them.

0:45:50	SPEAKER_00
 And the thing that makes it okay to do that is knowing where the sync time boundaries are.

0:45:56	SPEAKER_00
 Because you can automatically pretty much merge things if you've only got 20 words or so in an utterance.

0:46:01	SPEAKER_00
 It's when you get the whole meeting.

0:46:03	SPEAKER_00
 And the sync times have changed.

0:46:05	SPEAKER_00
 Or you can't correspond to a previous version with sync times that you get in trouble.

0:46:10	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:46:17	SPEAKER_00
 Was there anything else?

0:46:19	SPEAKER_00
 Nope.

0:46:20	SPEAKER_03
 Should we do some digits?
