0:00:00	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:00:05	SPEAKER_04
 So I wanted to mention a couple little bits of news.

0:00:15	SPEAKER_04
 Heenick is supposed to come for a couple days next week.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know which days yet.

0:00:20	SPEAKER_04
 So hopefully we'll have some intensive time to work with people.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_04
 One thing is that we're starting to talk about maybe having Sunil come here for some chunk of the summer.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_04
 So that may or may not happen.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_04
 But if he does, since actually Pradhiva is going to be off at IBM, the effort will pretty much shift here.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_04
 Because Sunil will be here and other people are working in other things, I think.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_04
 So that's my news.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_03
 I need to have this.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_04
 There you go.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_03
 It will be some time in December, July or August.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, it may not happen.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_04
 I think he wants some experience someplace else.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_04
 He's thinking of going someplace.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_04
 But Pradhiva is getting her experience going to IBM and he may come here.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_04
 But I don't know.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe June.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe earlier.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_04
 But anyway, Heenick will be here next week.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe he'll know more about it.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the news, more specifically for Aurora.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_03
 So I guess there was again a conference call, but they're on a decide on everything yet.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_03
 For the VAD, they probably they will do something like having some kind of idealized VAD that they could run on the channel zero of the speech that car and then take the same and points and apply them on channel one.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_04
 Also take a real VAD, apply it to the clean.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, to the clean.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_03
 I think they're there.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_03
 Points for the noisy.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_03
 But I'm not sure this is decided yet.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_04
 And when they're talking about it, do you have the impression that they're talking about a particular VAD which everybody would use or just that everybody would use the same procedure?

0:02:48	SPEAKER_03
 Pradhiva is the same VAD for everybody.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_05
 So they would just provide that as part of the data?

0:02:57	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_03
 But does it still?

0:03:00	SPEAKER_04
 It sounds like they're still arguing.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_03
 They're decided.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_03
 Nothing much.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_03
 Probably these weightings, they will apply the same kind of weighting scheme for the IDG sheets then for the pitch that car.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_03
 So it would be weighting of, it would be an average of improvements rather than average of whatever rates which would make the more clean parts of the IDG it's more important than they are right now.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_04
 But it sounds like none of this is really decided that this is how things are leaning.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_03
 I think they will tend to good this way.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_03
 We have the result for the tandem with MSG also.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_03
 So it was.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_03
 There is no surprise.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_03
 So there is no significant improvement.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_03
 Basically that's all.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_03
 We've started to work on some kind of report of the work.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_03
 So we've not much.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_04
 You have a lunch talk sometime.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_04
 It's next week.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_04
 Next week?

0:04:44	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_05
 How about the thing you guys were working on before?

0:04:51	SPEAKER_05
 Boyz, 10 boys.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, but this week I am beginning to write the report.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_00
 I stopped it.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_00
 You stopped working on it.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_04
 So it sounds like basically things are slowing down a bit and trying to collate results.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_03
 Something from it?

0:05:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_03
 Right now Sunil seems to be in India actually.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_03
 So there is no progress from their side.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_04
 But that's where it puts it on us to do it.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_04
 I'm sorry?

0:05:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, who was looking at the combination of spectrosatraction approaches with what we had?

0:05:50	SPEAKER_03
 Sunil was working on this.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_03
 He sent a bunch of results.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what the status of this.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_03
 I guess it was just the result that he sent.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_04
 Again.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_03
 He just used spectrosatraction and the LDA filters, I guess.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_03
 And it was not better than what we had before.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_03
 Then he tried to put the online normalization.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_03
 It did not improve further putting the online normalization.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_04
 Well.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_04
 So I guess nothing has ever happened about making the standardized place where the software sits so that people can work with it.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I sent mail to start the process.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_03
 And I guess we should have to.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_03
 What we know most what we have to put in this.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_04
 So I guess.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_04
 Well, let's come back to this later.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_04
 Did you get a chance to do any more stuff with the.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_05
 I didn't.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_05
 Are you talking about.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_05
 Is DK here?

0:07:29	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_05
 This week I have been my whole time taking up with the meeting recorder stuff.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_05
 Discrash.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_04
 Covering things.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_04
 It's maybe a very short meeting.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_04
 Anything from your side?

0:07:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_01
 There.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_01
 Well, one thing in the paper, Avandano and his collaborators wrote is that they tried doing channel normalization on the reverberant speech by subtracting the mean of the log spectral magnitude over a two-second window.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_01
 But they didn't do anything with the phase.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_01
 And they said perhaps that limited their approach that they did not try to normalize the phase anyway.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm going to start thinking about ways that the that the phase could be used.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_01
 If the channel and the reverberation is multiplicative in the frequency domain with the speech spectrum, then the phases should be additive.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_01
 So just subtracting the mean of the phase would help.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't know.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_01
 I get the impression that they tried to do some things with the phase and they were in success.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_05
 Well, you know, there is one other thing.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_05
 Stefan showed me a paper yesterday where for the Italian system they had done a series of experiments playing around with the number of iterations that I talked about last week.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_05
 And so there was a whole series of those that they had done.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_05
 They didn't think reported timing for those.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_05
 But it turns out that the processing was not the best in their series of experiments.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe it's because they wanted to use the same number of iterations across all different languages.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_05
 And this was only done on Italian.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_05
 Sure. Who's the hey?

0:09:37	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know who did it.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_05
 You know, Stefan, who is that?

0:09:40	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_03
 But it's the company who prepared the Italian database.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_03
 So it was is it Alcatel or?

0:09:50	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_05
 So, you know, there wasn't a huge difference in terms of the performance across all the different experiments that they did.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_05
 But it varied a little bit.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_05
 And so I guess the main thing that I take out of that is that I think that for our purposes here we could definitely, you know, decrease the number of iterations that we do.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_05
 And at least while we're, you know, working on all different kinds of variations and that will let us, you know, come through a lot more experiments.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_05
 So I still have to send everybody a pointer about how to run the HTK system on the Linux boxes and about changing the number of iterations of it.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_05
 So you can do that.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_05
 So the other thing that I was thinking about maybe trying out next is, oh, the other experiment that they had in that paper was playing with a number of Gaussian's per state.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_03
 So I think it was playing with a number of states per word.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_03
 They had 16, 17, 18.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_03
 It was a number of states.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because it was around between 16 and 20 or...

0:11:05	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_05
 I should look at that more carefully because I wonder what they did about.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, I was thinking it was Gaussian's.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_03
 So, and...

0:11:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_03
 Apparently they had better results when they increased the number of states from 18 to 20.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_05
 So the thing I was thinking about was, you know, the number of insertions really goes up when you start adding all the noise in.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_05
 And maybe the thing to do next would be to try to make the silence model more powerful.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_05
 And then increasing the number of Gaussian to the number of states, different things like that.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_05
 So it's probably the next little thing I'll play with when I get a chance.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_04
 Let's see.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_04
 Why don't we...

0:11:59	SPEAKER_04
 There aren't any other major things.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_04
 Why don't we do the digits and then turn the mic off?

0:12:05	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_04
 So I'll start.
