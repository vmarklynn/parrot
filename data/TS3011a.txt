0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 Good morning, Florentine.

0:00:11	SPEAKER_03
 Good morning.

0:00:15	SPEAKER_01
 Marketing experts.

0:00:23	SPEAKER_00
 All right. Are you ready?

0:00:25	SPEAKER_00
 You should put the laptop right into the square.

0:00:29	SPEAKER_00
 For the camera.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_00
 For the camera.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_00
 Good morning, Smelstein.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_02
 Good morning.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_02
 Mr. PN.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_02
 How are you today?

0:00:38	SPEAKER_00
 I'm fine.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_02
 How was your business trip to Boston?

0:00:41	SPEAKER_00
 Well, actually.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_00
 I didn't go.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_00
 I didn't feel like it.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_00
 Do you want to open it?

0:00:48	SPEAKER_00
 That's redownly.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_00
 I guess I should close it here.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_03
 You have the same message of Windows Connection.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_01
 I'm so happy to have a flight.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, stand by.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_03
 Close the window.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. The waiting is for our marketing expert.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_00
 Root.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_00
 Root.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_00
 Project.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_00
 Kick off.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_02
 Is there a schedule for this meeting?

0:01:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, there is.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_00
 Actually.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_00
 I will...

0:01:18	SPEAKER_00
 This is the agenda for today.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_00
 For this meeting.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_00
 Good morning, Root.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_00
 It's important.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_00
 Shall we close the door?

0:01:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yes. Great.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_00
 It's important that the laptops are exactly on the square.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_00
 For the cameras.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_00
 We're here to develop a new product.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_00
 And this is the first meeting to generate some ideas about it.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_00
 Root.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_00
 Root is here as the marketing expert.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_00
 Root is here as the user interface designer.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_00
 And Sebastian is here in the role of industrial designer.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_00
 Is that correct?

0:02:29	SPEAKER_00
 That's correct.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to do a little tool training for the tools we are going to use during the meetings we are going to have here.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_00
 Then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan and we will have a discussion.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_00
 This meeting should take no more than 25 minutes.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_02
 So we should keep that in mind.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_02
 Is there any room for a little presentation?

0:03:00	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe during the discussion?

0:03:02	SPEAKER_02
 There is.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, there is.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_00
 No problem.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, this new product we are going to develop.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_00
 It is remote control, a television remote control.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_00
 And first of all, it should be original, it should be trendy and user friendly.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_00
 Those are kind of easy goals.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_00
 And I am sure we can find more goals for the product we are going to develop.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_00
 We will discuss later on more ideas about how the remote should look and how it should function.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_00
 And all those kind of things.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_00
 The market.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_00
 We should have a look at the market.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_00
 We are going to use a project method during this development, which consists of three different design stages.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_00
 The functional design, the conceptual design and the detailed design.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_00
 All of these stages mean that we do some individual work, prepare, and then meet to discuss our...

0:04:17	SPEAKER_00
 The progressions?

0:04:20	SPEAKER_00
 The progressions, yes.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_00
 The first stage, the functional design, we are going to search for the user requirements.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_00
 And we will make a specification of that.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_00
 The second is the technical functional design.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_00
 What effect should the remote have?

0:04:45	SPEAKER_00
 Well, in this case, control the television, I think.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_00
 And the last one is the working design.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_00
 How exactly does it work in the technical sense?

0:04:58	SPEAKER_00
 The other design stages, we will discuss that later.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_00
 So we'll keep it with the functional design.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_00
 Before we think about remote control, we will work with some of the tools we have here.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_00
 As you see now, I can give a presentation.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_00
 It's also possible to use this one as well.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_00
 You can display two presentations as you want to.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_00
 To present it to show us a file, you'll need to place it in your project documents folder, which is on your desktop, at least it should be.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_00
 Then we have this electronic whiteboard system.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I will show that now.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_00
 You can draw on the board using this pen.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_00
 There are little sensors, so do not grab it here with a little bit more to the end.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_00
 It's on the eraser now, so we click the pen button.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so not too fast writing.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_00
 You can insert a new slide or a whiteboard file by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_00
 It's quite the same.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_00
 All our smartboard notes should be kept in the same file.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_00
 So do not make a new file, just use this one during the day.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_00
 You can use the eraser to make something go away.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_03
 We'll use the same whiteboard file.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_03
 We can work together on it while we're using it in the meetings.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_00
 In the meetings, only in the meetings.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_00
 It's really like the regular whiteboard.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_00
 You can choose the format.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_00
 Let me see.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I guess it's maybe because I'm not ben selected.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_00
 Current color.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_00
 You can choose not a color.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_00
 For example, black and you can choose the line width.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_00
 So now I have a different line width and color.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. Quite easy if you do have any questions.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_00
 I wrote down the documents should be in the project documents folder if you want to discuss it with us.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_00
 As a little training, I will ask Ruth first to draw your own animal on a new slide with a different color and a different line width.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_00
 Then the one now selected.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_01
 And then I'm all.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_03
 It's a bunny rabbit.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_00
 A rabbit.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_00
 Well, great.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_00
 Could you do the same, please?

0:09:23	SPEAKER_00
 Of course.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_00
 But a different animal with a different color and a different line width.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_00
 So, Sebastian is thinking about the animal.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_02
 Just guessing what should be my favorite animal.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_03
 I'm thinking about it too.

0:09:39	None
 Okay.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it looked more than a bunny than a cat, but it works, right?

0:10:08	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_00
 I'm guessing a horse.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_03
 With a very small legs.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not very good in drawing.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_03
 You should feed that to the animal.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I guess you get the ID.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_02
 Beautiful.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_00
 Beautiful.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_00
 So, you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_00
 Any questions?

0:11:32	SPEAKER_00
 Well, just let me know.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_00
 Back to our project.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_00
 The remote control we are going to develop.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_00
 We will have a selling price of about 25 euros.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_00
 The profit we are looking for for this product is 50 million euros.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_00
 Which is quite a number.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_00
 We will focus internationally.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_00
 So, the product will be sold if there is market interest in more than one country.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_00
 And the production costs should not be more than 12 euros 50.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_00
 So, we should keep that in mind during the development.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_00
 Because, well, those are important numbers.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_00
 Then, the discussion.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_02
 I have some technical issues, which I would like to present to you.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_02
 Before we start the discussion, because there might be some.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_02
 Influencians.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_02
 First about my role, role of the industrial designer, I would like to think about the implementation of things and the technical possibilities and impossibilities.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_02
 So, if someone of you comes up with ideas, I will try to translate them in technical functions.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_02
 But there might be some impossibilities.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_02
 So, that's one.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_02
 And I also will propose some.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_02
 Some implementations for that.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_02
 But, well, these are quite the same.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry about that.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_02
 And I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities, which are available, and which might be interesting to implement in our product.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_02
 I have some initial ideas about some things, which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming discussion.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_02
 One thing about interoperability.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_02
 I think modern remote control shoots control a device, diverse subset of equipment, for instance, DVD player, cell phones, video and audio equipment.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_02
 So, one remote control for audio equipment.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_03
 For cell phones?

0:14:35	SPEAKER_02
 Well, there should be some interoperability between them.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_02
 I think it can come in handy.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_02
 We should discuss that.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_02
 And we should think about the way how these things should communicate with each other.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_02
 We're not living in the 1980s anymore, so infrared is not really...

0:14:58	SPEAKER_02
 not really hard technical stuff anymore.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_02
 But you should think about things like Bluetooth.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but the infrared is, well, a little bit old-fashioned, if you would call it that.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_03
 But old-to-feeds are equipped with infrared.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you can not all.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_03
 So, that's the most of them.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_03
 Or you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_02
 But that's something we should discuss about everybody should think about it.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_02
 So, that's just my role.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_02
 I'll just give you everybody some technical input.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_02
 And I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what the product should be and how it should look.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_02
 But take these things into account when you start the discussion.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so the main point you are telling us are focused on the interoperability.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_02
 And one remote control should control one or more pieces of equipment.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_02
 And the way of communicating with these equipment.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, good.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_00
 That was your presentation.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_00
 That's it.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, okay.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, great.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_00
 I'll go back to my own presentation.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_00
 I do think it's time now to discuss some things.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_00
 Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implications.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_00
 There are other things like how to make it trendy, which is I think most routes roll.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_00
 The way how it should be controlled by the user, which is a rule during this part.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_00
 So, let's start with you.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_00
 How do you think the remote should function for the user?

0:17:07	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I add a few things in mind.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the interoperability, just like Sebastian said, remote should work on different TVs or even different devices.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just a new store.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_03
 I think it should be for Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_00
 So, we're going business to consumer.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_00
 It's not a...

0:17:52	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_02
 I have to fail in making this product for a specific vendor.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_02
 We're just developing this product and we want to set it to a very broad public.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_02
 So, we should fit to every device.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_00
 The routes?

0:18:05	SPEAKER_00
 Do you agree?

0:18:06	SPEAKER_00
 I think they're right.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the technical function, what you said, is just by pressing the button, you should change the state of the TV.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_03
 That's just the basic technical function.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_03
 That's really my part for this session.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_00
 So, is that ease of use or is that more like...

0:18:31	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the technical function is pure.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_03
 What should the remote control do?

0:18:37	SPEAKER_03
 What is his task?

0:18:39	SPEAKER_03
 As an device.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_03
 It just should change the TVs state.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_03
 So, that's it.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_02
 But, as far as the buttons, as a means of doing this, or other...

0:18:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, or the buttons.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_03
 Or maybe you want a touchscreen or...

0:18:58	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I've seen these remote controls with this little stick, which you can move forward, the side-words.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_02
 And it's very easy for you to switch...

0:19:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_02
 Switch between channels or between tracks on a CD, on chapters, on a DVD player.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_02
 So, maybe that's an idea, I don't know.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_03
 For other user interface, I had...

0:19:25	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's more industrial, I think.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_03
 Pointing at a TV, I think it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to a TV.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_03
 So, you must point it everywhere.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe not even pointed.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, just don't even point it.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_03
 So, in that case, infrared should maybe be restriction to that.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_02
 And it's the restriction for the range, the operating range, too.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_02
 So, when you're not able to point at the device...

0:19:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, if you go to radio...

0:19:58	SPEAKER_03
 For TV, you're always in the neighborhood of a TV.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_03
 So, I don't think the range should be a problem to that.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_03
 If you want to get it working with a radio and you're in outside your garden with just one speaker, then maybe the range should be...

0:20:16	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, gentlemen.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_00
 Just to remind you, we have five minutes left for this meeting.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_03
 Two more things.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_03
 You're able to feel the buttons without...

0:20:29	SPEAKER_03
 You have to know what you do without looking at the buttons.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_03
 So, it should be...

0:20:36	SPEAKER_03
 As user interface, for feeling, it should be good to understand.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_03
 So, you can feel the buttons for volume or whatever, I think.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_03
 And, of course, you don't always know where all buttons are.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_03
 So, it should be visible in dark, too.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_03
 Those are two really used interface.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_00
 I'll write down glow in the dark.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_00
 That's perfect.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_00
 I just want to hear Ruts' input for this meeting.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_00
 Do you have anything already...

0:21:15	SPEAKER_00
 Idea about how the market will respond to such a product, or what we should take in account when developing such a product?

0:21:23	SPEAKER_01
 I think most things have already been said, like control multiple devices.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_01
 And infrared might be an issue.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_00
 Because?

0:21:35	SPEAKER_01
 Well, he said about pointing.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_01
 But lots of devices already use infrared.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_01
 So, we probably have to implement that.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_00
 Sebastian, did you have any other ideas?

0:22:01	SPEAKER_02
 Well, yes, I had.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_02
 About three months ago.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_02
 I've seen it, I've forgotten.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yes, I remember.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_02
 You said something about visibility in dark.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_02
 Would it be nice for a user to have display on this remote control, on which you can see functions, which makes it easier to operate.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_03
 Well, maybe I...

0:22:28	SPEAKER_03
 It can be quite simple.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_03
 You can just have white buttons with a black mark on it.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_03
 The digits in black, then it's already visible in dark.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_03
 So, it don't have to be lightening or fancy.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it can be for design.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because we want to develop a trendy product.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_02
 So, there's a cost limitation too.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_02
 12 euro 50.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_02
 That's a big problem, I think.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_02
 I think the financial part of this project implicates that it's not going to be a high end product.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_02
 The cost price is very low.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_03
 Just to mention something.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_03
 The digits of the painting on the buttons should not fade.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, very good.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_03
 Always have...

0:23:14	SPEAKER_03
 The soft buttons always clear the paint on it.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_00
 I have one point which comes in mind now.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_00
 I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily, or should not consume too much power.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_00
 Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every other week.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_00
 So, maybe we could, for example, only light the buttons that are applicable at that moment.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_00
 Or, yeah, I don't know.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_00
 That's more...

0:24:01	SPEAKER_00
 Sebastian's...

0:24:02	SPEAKER_03
 But then Bluetooth might be a problem.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_03
 Because I think Bluetooth uses a lot of...

0:24:08	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that's it.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_02
 I have cell phones have integrated Bluetooth also.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it seems to work quite okay.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_03
 But you can use Bluetooth all the time, 24 hours a day.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_00
 Jenswen, it's over.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_00
 I'm afraid we do not have any more time.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_00
 So, we will go back to our own work.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_00
 Next meeting starts in 30 minutes.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_00
 And, well, you know your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about it.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_00
 So, this was...

0:24:45	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_00
 See you in 30 minutes.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_03
 Great.
