0:00:30	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, good morning everybody.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_01
 I'm glad you could all come.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_01
 I'm really excited to start this team.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just going to have a little PowerPoint presentation for us for kickoff meeting.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_01
 My name is Rose Lindgren.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_01
 I'll be the project manager.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_01
 Our agenda today is we're going to do a little opening and then I'm going to talk a little bit about the project.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_01
 Then we'll move into acquaintance, just getting to know each other a little bit, including a tool training exercise.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_01
 Then we'll move into the project plan, do a little discussion and close since we only have 25 minutes.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_01
 First of all, our project aim.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_01
 We're creating a new remote control which we have three goals about.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_01
 It needs to be original, trendy and user friendly.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_01
 I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_01
 So we're going to divide this up into three parts.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_01
 The functional design, which will be first will do individual work coming to a meeting, the conceptual design, individual work in a meeting and then the detailed design, individual work in a meeting.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_01
 So that we'll each be doing our own ideas when coming together and collaborating.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, we're going to get to know each other a little bit.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_01
 So what we're going to do is start off with Amina, Alima, sorry, Alima.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to do a little tool training.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_01
 So we're going to work with that whiteboard behind you.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_01
 Introduce yourself, say one thing about yourself and then draw your favorite animal and tell us about it.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know which one of those things I have to bring with me.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_01
 Probably both.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_02
 Right, so I'm supposed to draw my favorite animal.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_02
 I have no drawing skills whatsoever, but let's see, introduce myself.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_02
 My name is Alima, Buchintini.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_02
 I'm from the state of Maine in the US.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_02
 I'm doing nationalism studies.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_02
 Blah, blah, blah.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_02
 I have no artistic talent.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_01
 How do you spell your name?

0:02:33	SPEAKER_02
 A-L-I-M-A.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_02
 Thanks.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, and I guess I'm the industrial designer on this project.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_02
 So let's see if I can get here.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_02
 I will draw a little turtle for you all.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_02
 Not necessarily because it's my absolute favorite animal, but just that I think they're drawable.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_02
 You have the pretty little shell going on.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_02
 There you go.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_02
 It's a turtle.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_02
 So what are your favorite characteristics?

0:03:18	SPEAKER_02
 I like the whole having a shell thing.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_02
 It's quite cool.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_02
 Carry your home around where you go.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_02
 Quite decorative little animals.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_02
 They can swim.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_02
 They're very adaptable.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_02
 They carry everything they need with them.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_02
 And they're easy to draw.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_01
 Excellent.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_01
 So we just go around the table.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_00
 Well, my name's Ian.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not here.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_00
 These are in space.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to put a project.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_00
 I'm trying to own my family.

0:03:53	None
 I should leave that one on.

0:03:55	None
 No, you can raise the turtle with some.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_00
 It might be nice to see you.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not going to draw it quite this way.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_00
 You can start, do directly.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_00
 Oh my god, it's not even a nightmare.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, the reason I like my eyes is because I'm the best bulldog client in some of these.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_00
 I know, so they're kind of mistakes.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_00
 We don't really know much about them or understand how they work, and they're fun groups.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_00
 It's my name, it's Chris and Naomi.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_03
 I'm trying contraptions with me.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_03
 All right, I'm Jessie.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_03
 I'm from around DC, I just sort of in the US.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_03
 And we're going to keep the deep sea sort of theme going on with our animals.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_03
 I don't really know how to draw them.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_03
 We could do the water to help sort of give an idea.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_03
 I have no idea how one would explain this.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_03
 I need some whiskers.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_03
 Basically, it's supposed to be a feel.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_03
 You can imagine it in the water.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_03
 I like them because they're like playful and silly sort of.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_03
 Have a good time.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not going to try to pretend like it can get any better than that.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, I'm Rose, I'm project manager from California.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_02
 Let's see.

0:06:42	None
 Let's see.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_03
 It's definitely going to be harder once you're doing it.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_01
 It's actually a coyote.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_01
 Let's see.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_01
 I'll have to give it a little bit of snout.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_01
 Some teeth.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's pretty impressive.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_01
 Oh dear.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_01
 I live right across the street from an open space in California.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_01
 We have coyotes all the time.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_01
 So I really enjoy their singing and their really beautiful animals.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_01
 Moving on to slightly more serious stuff.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to talk about project finances.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_01
 We'd like to sell it for about 25 euro with a profit aim of 50 million euro for all our sales.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_01
 And because this is such, this is for television, it's a, we have a market range of internet, like it's an international market range.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_01
 We don't have to worry about specifics.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_01
 In order to make a profit of this magnitude, we need to be able to produce each one at a maximum of 1250 euro.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_01
 So we're selling it for twice, what we'd like to produce it for.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_01
 Just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project, I'd like to hear about your experiences using remote controls.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_01
 Your first idea is about creating a new remote control, what would be the best that you, what are the features that you really like, what are the features that you don't like, etc.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_01
 So.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_03
 I hate when there's like, port of the buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the TV like you have to do one for the power of the TV.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_03
 And then like, another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know, now they keep combining all different remotes together.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_03
 And I don't know if I necessarily like that because I feel like you end up like multimedia overload.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_03
 I just want to watch the TV.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 Always get to fast.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_03
 I'm sort of like, device to help you find it.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_00
 I've used a new remote controls, it's like a TV and a CD player and it's a product.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_00
 I guess that's what you need.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_00
 You don't have to get up and walk across the TV.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_00
 Especially if you're someone really lazy like me.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_00
 I find that they can be a bit annoying, especially when I watch the TV.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_00
 I have to have to accept that there's a controls, one for the TV, one for the digital box, one for the digital box as well.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_00
 And also they tend to be a bit confusing.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_00
 There's not too many buttons on them.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_00
 It's just complicated.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_00
 It's all I really want to do is switch off.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_02
 I agree with having too many remotes around.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_02
 My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know how to work half of them.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_02
 What's important for me, I guess, is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_02
 They're not too small.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_02
 I need to know what you're doing.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_02
 One thing I particularly like is if you're not moving it around to get it to work with the infrared here, I think there's a way around that.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_02
 I know in my residence right now that the television you have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_02
 It's just simpler just to turn around the TV itself.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_02
 I think that if you're going to make remote control, it should actually work for what it's doing.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_03
 Without batteries and things like that, are there some remotes that don't require batteries or do well remotes require batteries?

0:11:06	SPEAKER_01
 I would imagine all of them, but it's also we could use a lithium battery that would last a lot longer than AAAs.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_01
 Those are the batteries that are used in a lot of MP3 players now.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_01
 It seems we have a little bit of a conflict over combining all the remotes together versus having five different remotes.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_01
 You don't like having all the buttons on one remote, and yet you don't want to have five remotes.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_01
 How do we work with that?

0:11:47	SPEAKER_02
 Could we get something that just has all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or other things that I'm not very coherent about?

0:12:00	SPEAKER_02
 That just has your major buttons for that work for everything, volume control on off channel changing.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe that spatially divides it.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_03
 If you're looking at the TV on the top thing on the remote, I don't know if it would be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're going to make it.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_03
 If it's all the TV stuff is here, then all the VCR stuff is here, all the whatever else we have programmed into it.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's all just in a separate place and not all the on buttons together.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_03
 You're like, I don't even know what I'm turning on.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_02
 If you'd saved the more complicated functions, maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe have one remote that has the main functions on off channel changing volume and another remote with all the special things.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_01
 Because that is one thing that remotes tend to have buttons that the TV's no longer have as well.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_01
 You have to have them somewhere because you're going to need those special functions occasionally.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_01
 But not necessarily on the normal amount.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_00
 Can I ask a re-designing or remote control for television only?

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 Good question.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's just TV.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_03
 But I'm not protecting it just where it's at.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_03
 New product and new television or remote control.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_03
 It's not like a good thing to say.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_03
 I think it might be more advanced than that.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_00
 So we should be seeing that it's just the television that they wanted to be.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_00
 So I guess we have to define what we're aiming for.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_02
 If it's just a television movement, it's a bit simpler because there's less buttons that would even need to be on it.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_02
 It's an idea that the button is being visible and large.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_02
 If you have older people or people like me that aren't very coordinated hand-eye, it's really quite important that you're not pressing a small, 15 mobile phone size buttons if we can help it.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. Sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_01
 Mind if we move on?

0:14:47	SPEAKER_01
 Now our next meeting starts in 30 minutes.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_01
 I believe we've actually been only working on this one for about 20.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_01
 So we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_01
 But this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_01
 The Industrial Design, Alima, we'll be doing the working design.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_01
 The User Interface Designer, that's for you, technical functions, I guess, like keeping in mind the buttons, things, the size of the buttons.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_01
 User requirements.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_01
 So you'll be hearing about different trends, about different things that people need.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_01
 I guess kind of the same discussion that we've been having will get from actual consumers.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_01
 And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach. I realize in this past when we didn't have much, we just wanted to get a little brainstorming done.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_01
 So, very excited to see all your animals and how wonderful artists we all are.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_01
 Any questions?

0:16:00	None
 I haven't gotten an agenda yet. I'll put that together.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sure as we'll each get our own instructions, because what we're going to do is for sorry individual actions and then we'll come back together.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sure we'll be busy.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. I'll type up minutes and probably email those out to all of you, just including all the things that we talked about.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I think I can.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_01
 I'll just attach it to any of you. And your number two, three, four, is that correct?

0:16:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. It's lovely meeting you all.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_01
 Make sure to keep checking the company website and the emails.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_01
 Let me see if I can do that right now.
