0:00:30	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, good morning everybody.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_01
 I'm glad you could all come.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_01
 I'm really excited to start this team.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just going to have a little PowerPoint presentation for us for kick off meeting.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_01
 My name is Rose Lundgren, I'll be the project manager.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_01
 Our agenda today is we're going to do a little opening and then I'm going to talk a little bit about the project.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_01
 Then we'll move into acquaintance, just getting to know each other a little bit, including a tool training exercise.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_01
 I know we'll move into the project plan, do a little discussion and close since we only have 25 minutes.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_01
 First of all, our project aim, we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_01
 It needs to be original, trendy and user friendly.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_01
 I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_01
 So we're going to divide this up into three parts.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_01
 The functional design, which will first do individual work, come into a meeting, the conceptual design, individual work in a meeting, and then the detailed design, individual work and a meeting.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_01
 They will each be doing our own ideas when coming together and collaborating.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, we're going to get to know each other a little bit.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_01
 What we're going to do is start off with a MENA, Alima, sorry, Alima.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to do a little tool training.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to work with that white board behind you.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_01
 Introduce yourself, say one thing about yourself and then draw your favorite animal and tell us about it.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know which one of those I have to bring with me.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_01
 Probably both.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_02
 Right, so I'm supposed to draw my favorite animal.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_02
 I have no drawing skills whatsoever, but let's see, introduce myself.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_02
 My name is Alima, which is in Tini.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_02
 I'm from the state of Maine in the US.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_02
 I'm doing Nationalism Studies.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_02
 Blah, blah, blah.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_02
 I'm a have no artistic talent.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_01
 How do you spell your name?

0:02:33	SPEAKER_02
 A-L-I-M-A.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_02
 Thanks.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, and I guess I'm the industrial designer on this project.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_02
 Let's see if I can get here.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_02
 I will draw a little turtle for you all.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_02
 It's not necessarily because it's my absolute favorite animal, but just that I think there's a lot of animals.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_02
 So what are your favorite characteristics?

0:03:18	SPEAKER_02
 I like the whole heaven of shell thing.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_02
 It's quite cool.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_02
 Carry your home around where you go.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_02
 They're decorative little animals.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_02
 They can swim.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_02
 They're very adaptable.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_02
 They carry everything they need with them.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_02
 And they're easy to draw.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_01
 Excellent.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_01
 So we just go around the table.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_00
 I go for my name's Ian.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not a user in space.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not a product.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_00
 I'm trying to hold my phone up.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_00
 I should leave that one out.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_01
 No, you can erase the turtle itself.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_00
 It might be nice to have them all up there at the same time.

0:04:09	None
 I'm not going to draw it quite this time.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_00
 It's not at least an identity part of our home.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_03
 It's a whale.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_03
 It's a whale.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_00
 Oh my god.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_00
 That's not an ordinary whale.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_00
 That's not an ordinary whale.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_00
 The reason I like my house is because what's more than quite intelligent.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_00
 And that kind of mistakes.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_00
 We don't really know much about them.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_00
 We don't understand how they work.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_00
 And they're going to be just like, it's my name.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_03
 That's my name.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_03
 I'm Jeffy.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_03
 I'm from around DC, I just thought of in the US.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_03
 And we're going to keep the deep sea theme going on.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_03
 Are they animals?

0:05:28	SPEAKER_03
 Don't really know how to draw this.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_03
 I think I do the water.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_03
 Help.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_03
 Sort of give an idea.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_03
 I have no idea how one would explain this.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to make some whiskers.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_03
 Basically it's supposed to be a seal.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_03
 You can imagine it in the water.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_03
 I like them because they're like playful and silly.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_03
 Sort of have a good time.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not going to try them for time.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_03
 It can get me better than that.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, I'm Rose and I'm project manager from California.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to make some whiskers.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to make some whiskers.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to make some whiskers.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_03
 It's definitely going to be harder once you're doing it.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_01
 It's actually a coyote.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_01
 Give it a little bit of a snout.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_02
 That's pretty impressive.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_01
 I live across the street from an open space in California.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_01
 We have coyotes all the time.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_01
 I really enjoy their singing and their beautiful animals.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_01
 Moving on to more serious stuff.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to talk about project finances.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to talk about the numbers in the world.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to talk about the number of meaningful...

0:07:40	SPEAKER_01
 We'd like to sell it for about 25 euros with a profit aim of 50 million euros for all our sales.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_01
 Because this is for television, we have a market range of internet.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_01
 In international market range, we don't have to worry about specifics.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_01
 In order to make a profit of this magnitude, So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_01
 Just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project, I'd like to hear about your experiences using remote controls, your first ideas about creating a new remote control, what would be the best that you, what are the features that you really like, what are the features that you don't like, etc.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_03
 I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the TV like you have to do one for the power of the TV and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_03
 Now they keep combining all different remote's together and I don't know if I necessarily like that because I feel like you end up like multi-media overload.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_03
 I just want to watch the TV here.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 Always gets paused.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_03
 I'm sort of like devised to help you find it.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_00
 I do.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_00
 I do like because it's a TV and a CD player and it's a computer.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_00
 I guess that we're going to get up and move across the TV.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_00
 Especially if you're someone really lazy like me.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_00
 I find that they can be annoying especially my modules TV.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_00
 I have a tablet that's a computer, I have a one-pilety TV, one-pilety TV box, one-pilety TV, and it's a lot of fun.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_00
 I also like that.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_00
 I think that we've been using that for too many buttons on them.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_00
 It's just complicated.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_00
 It's all I really want to do is switch on and off.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_00
 Change the channel, change the volume.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_02
 I agree with having too many remote's around.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_02
 My dad has a whole drawer at home of remote's for various things so I don't know how to work half of them.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_02
 What's important for me, I guess, is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_02
 They're not too small.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_02
 I need to know what you're doing.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_02
 One thing I particularly like is if you're not moving it around to get it to work with the infrared, yeah.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_02
 I think there's a way around that.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_02
 But I know in my residence right now that the television you have to walk all around the room to turn on.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_02
 It's just simpler to turn around the TV itself.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_02
 If you're going to make a remote control, it should actually work for what it's doing.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_03
 There's about batteries and things like that.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_03
 Are there some remote that don't require batteries or do well or remote require batteries?

0:11:06	SPEAKER_01
 I would imagine all of them, but it's also we could use a lithium battery.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_01
 That would last a lot longer than AA's.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_01
 Those are the batteries that are used in a lot of MP3 players now.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_01
 That kind of thing.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_01
 It seems we have a little bit of a conflict over combining all the remote's together versus having five different remote's.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_01
 You said you don't like having all the buttons on one remote and yet you don't want to have five remote's.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_01
 How do we work with that?

0:11:47	SPEAKER_02
 Could we get something that just has...

0:11:51	SPEAKER_02
 doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or programs, other things that I'm not very coherent about.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_02
 But that just has your major buttons for that work for everything.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_02
 Volume control on, off, channel changing.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe that spatially divides it.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_03
 If you're trying to get the TV on, that's the top thing on the remote.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if it would be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're going to make it.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_03
 But if it's all the TV stuff is here, then all the DCR stuff is here, whatever else you have programmed into it.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's all just in a separate place and not all the on buttons together.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_03
 Because then you're like, I don't even know what I'm turning on.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_02
 If you'd save the more complicated functions, maybe for separate remotes, that you wouldn't need to use every day.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so maybe you have one remote that has the main functions on, off, channel changing volume, and another remote remote with all the special things.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_01
 Because that is one thing that, remotes tend to have buttons that the TVs no longer have as well.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 So you have to have them somewhere, because you're going to need those special functions occasionally.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_01
 But not necessarily on the normal mode.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_00
 Can I ask a read?

0:13:05	SPEAKER_00
 Is there any remote control for television?

0:13:08	SPEAKER_00
 Good question.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_00
 The first device is just to be used for the television.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_00
 Would we even technically be possible to get more defined from the...

0:13:20	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know that yet.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_00
 Is it just the...

0:13:29	SPEAKER_01
 It's a good question.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_03
 I'll look into it.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's just TV.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, if we're taking it, just write it sad.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_03
 New product, a new television remote control.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_03
 It's not like...

0:13:45	SPEAKER_03
 You know, I think it might be more advanced than that.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_03
 So we should...

0:13:53	SPEAKER_00
 No, there should be something...

0:13:55	SPEAKER_00
 It's just the television that they want to be.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_00
 But I suppose it would be nice to have...

0:14:01	SPEAKER_00
...right in the corner and stuff like that.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_00
 And if you could get a good remote, I don't know, I'm like...

0:14:07	SPEAKER_00
...telling about the camera.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_02
 So I guess we have to define what we're aiming for.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_02
 If it's just a television, then that...

0:14:15	SPEAKER_02
...subbit simpler, because there's less buttons that would even need to be on it.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_03
 It's an idea that the buttons being available and large.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_02
 If you have older people or people like me that aren't very coordinated, hand-eye, it's really quite important that you're not pressing a small...

0:14:31	SPEAKER_02
...continue mobile phone size buttons.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_02
 If we can help it.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_01
 Sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_01
 Might if we move on.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_01
 Now our next meeting starts in 30 minutes.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_01
 I believe we've actually been only working on this one for about 20.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_01
 So we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_01
 But this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_01
 The Industrial Design, Alima.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_01
 We'll be doing the working design.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_01
 Use your interface designer, that's for you.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_01
 So technical functions, I guess, like keeping in mind the buttons, the size of the buttons.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_01
 Use your requirements.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_01
 So you'll be hearing about different trends, about different things that people need.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_01
 I guess kind of the same discussion that we've been having.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_01
 We'll get from actual consumers.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_01
 And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_01
 I realized in this past when we didn't have much, we just wanted to get a little brainstorming done.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_01
 So, very excited to see all your animals and how wonderful artists we all are.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_01
 Any questions?

0:16:02	SPEAKER_00
 I haven't gotten an agenda yet.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_01
 I'll put that together.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sure as we'll each get our own instructions.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_01
 Because what we're going to do is first our individual actions, and then we'll come back together.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_01
 Sure, we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sure we'll be busy.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_01
 I'll type up the minutes and probably email those out to all of you, including all the things that we talked about.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I think I can.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_01
 I'll just attach it to you.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_01
 And your number two, I'm two, three, four, is that correct?

0:16:58	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_01
 It's lovely meeting you all.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_01
 Just make sure to keep checking the company website and the emails.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_01
 And then we'll see if I can do that right now.
