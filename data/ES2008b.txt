0:00:30	SPEAKER_04
 Good to see you all again.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_03
 Let's see if that can be done.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_04
 This is our functional design meeting.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_04
 We put the fashion in electronics.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_04
 Let's start.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, our agenda today.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_04
 Just took time.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_04
 It's 12-13.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to do an opening.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_04
 Did you all get the minutes?

0:01:28	SPEAKER_04
 I emailed them to you.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_04
 I'm also putting them in the shared folder.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_04
 We'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_04
 I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_04
 Then we have to make a decision on our route control functions.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_04
 Finally, we'll just close.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_04
 We're starting this meeting at approximately 12-13 and we have 40 minutes.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_04
 First of all, the functional design objectives.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_04
 We need to keep in mind the user requirements specification, what needs and desires are to be fulfilled.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_04
 Detectional functions design, what effect the apparatus should have, and the working design.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_04
 How the apparatus actually works to fulfill its function.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, three presentations.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_04
 You can go in any order you choose.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_01
 Should we go in the order that you just did it?

0:02:17	SPEAKER_03
 Sure.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_01
 Please do.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_01
 How do I hook my screen up?

0:02:28	SPEAKER_02
 I think you might have to dis-extros.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, do you?

0:02:31	None
 How does it work?

0:02:32	SPEAKER_00
 How does it work?

0:02:59	SPEAKER_03
 I hope it's fit.

0:03:02	None
 Boowski I think yes.

0:03:04	None
 So, this balance here will be a result after this section7.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_00
 That's a function I think yes.

0:03:10	None
 Vite speaker.

0:03:12	None
 Blue one.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_03
 Nothing.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_03
 one. That's it.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_04
 Is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and...

0:03:32	SPEAKER_01
 How weird, it's weird.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_02
 I think you just have to push it in really hard.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_02
 That's it.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, got it.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_03
 Let's take a little bit.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not attached to anything.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_01
 You do, right?

0:03:49	SPEAKER_01
 There you go.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_01
 So, I don't know if you guys are able to get access to the report that was online or if I'm the only one who is.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_01
 But, I don't even know how to play this.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_04
 Press the little presentation.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_04
 It's the... it looks like a Y kind of over there above draw.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_04
 There. That one.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_01
 There you go. Right.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_01
 So, we're just going to talk a little bit about functional requirements that people specified when they were asked.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_01
 I guess, real reaction did some market research.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_01
 They had 100 subjects into their usability lab and they watched them, watched TV, and recorded the frequency that they used, particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_01
 What they found was they analyzed people's desires and needs.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_01
 Focusing on their desires, people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_01
 75% of the 100 subjects noted that and that they... more importantly though, 80% said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know anything beyond what fancy means, but that's particularly of use to us, I think.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_01
 Also, they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 So, younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition, whereas the older people in the, like, 60 and above segment or so, did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_01
 People also had certain frustrations that I think that we could try to take into consideration with our design, that being people frustrated with losing their remotes.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_01
 I think over 50% of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_01
 People were also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_01
 And I think that ties back to what you were saying before, just that there's too many buttons, it just needs to be easy to use.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_01
 It also mentioned something called RSI, and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what RSI is.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_00
 What?

0:06:18	SPEAKER_01
 Ah, there we go.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_01
 People did not like that, so I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_01
 People did not like that.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_01
 The repetitive use, I guess, caused a strain.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_01
 Looking at the needs, people specified.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_01
 The problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behavioral.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_01
 People are only using 10% of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_01
 And what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_01
 People also zap, like change the channel, about 65% during an hour of use.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_01
 So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers, rather than things like the audio settings, the screen settings, and the channel settings, because they're used much more infrequently and probably complicate what's going on.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_01
 So I think that something that we might want to think about, the idea of an LCD screen was brought up, although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_01
 So I don't know if that's coming to me later.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_01
 I wasn't like that, but something for us to consider.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_01
 Also, just the phenomenon that lasts is more when it comes to the buttons on their remote or what we want to make easiest to use.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_01
 Make sure that something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote, as something like channel changing, that's used a lot more often.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_01
 And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer, we just need to focus on what it looks like that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly, and that it feels like the way they're going to use it.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_01
 So it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you very much. That was great.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_04
 Let's move on to the next presentation on effects.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_04
 So you, great.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_01
 Can we go up on the spare end?

0:08:28	SPEAKER_03
 The user interface, right?

0:08:36	SPEAKER_02
 Oh no.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's in the shared. If I did it right, if anyone wants to look at it, I'm going to go ahead and say thank you.

0:09:14	None
 Okay.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm going to talk about the technical functions design that we're going to make from.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_00
 We need to start by considering what our remote control actually is. It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_00
 So it's basically communication device. We tell the remote control what we want to do.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_00
 So it's an advantage to the television, saying change the channel, change the volume. Yeah, I just need to set in the just the buttons.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_00
 How do we actually go about designing any television remote control?

0:10:09	SPEAKER_00
 The first thing to do is to come up with the design specifications.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_00
 We need to know what our final product is going to be like.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_00
 So we need a clear idea of exactly what this product does, how it works, and what the end user is going to want to do this product.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_00
 So a way I'd suggest that we could go about this by designing several different prototypes to use the interfaces for this product. And then trying to get some feedback about how well these particular prototypes work.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_00
 So by now what people think of them using a remote control is quite a subjective experience. And different people. We should remember that remote controls are a fairly standard piece of equipment when it uses using a remote control.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_00
 So the future expects the buttons to be in certain places. So in some sense we're going to have to aim for the device which is very conventional in design.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_00
 So we're not completely shocking people. But I think within that there is also been just to introduce novel ideas and to make something that's perhaps a little bit different from something that stands out.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_00
 So in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities. The first of these is technological. What can we do with the current state of technology as it is.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_00
 The second is economic. We need to find the balance between features and price. So as you mentioned things like waste recognition would add to the price.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_00
 And we would also need to improve the design of the products. So I have a look on the web to see if I can find a few examples of existing television and make control in analyzing these.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_00
 We can consider what things what's good about them. What things do they get like what's bad about them. It's wrong with them.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_00
 How we can improve on the designs that are found. And what can we do to make our products stand out from the large majority of the remote controls.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_00
 Here's two examples. Probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum. On the left here we've got an engineering based design of the remote control.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_00
 So it's one that's got lots of buttons. It's fully featured. Everything you might possibly want to do is there. You know it's got forward backwards, up, down, channel numbers, volume, these things.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_00
 It's fully featured. And it might take a while to get to learn to use it. But once you've learned it, you can do whatever you want with your TV.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_00
 The one on the right is a lot more basic. It's just got the essential functions of the TV, changing the channel, place, volume. It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_00
 But again, it swings around about the disadvantages. It can't use it. Say to freeze the television picture. There's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_00
 So we've got to find our find a way of striking the balance between the two.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_00
 As I said before, the back control is also objective. Different people want different things.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_00
 Personally what I want to know about control is a device that's simple. It's easy to use. It's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often, changing the volume, changing the channel.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_00
 It does everything that I need it to. As I said before, I'm quite lazy. I don't want to walk across the beam just to adjust my television. I also want something that looks cool and that feels like this ergonomically designed.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you very much. That was very useful. It's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes. Neither of them were very pretty.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_02
 I think that could be our selling point. Fashion, fashion, the mode, rights.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_00
 There's certainly a market technology that looks cool. That's my company's app. I really can't see what I'm doing. There it is.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_02
 I'm looking at it. Showing up already? Did it let you go on the internet? That was just funny.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_04
 I was like, I'm going to be going to the link. How do I play again? It's right above draw. There are three things. It's with bottom. There are three icons. It's the one that looks like a desk.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_02
 This is our working design presentation. I had a bit of some issues with this because I wasn't able to find everything I needed.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_02
 I guess we're still in early stages. The thing about working design is that we're trying to do as a working designer to figure out how the apparatus can fulfill its function.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_02
 One of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder. It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_02
 Then put the beans through a filter. That filters out. Then you get coffee at the end. That's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then other things that are brought in to make it work.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if I'm explaining that very well, but how do I get to the next? The method as working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfill this practical function, what needs to be done, and how do we convert all elements to make that done?

0:16:25	SPEAKER_02
 The easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen. You make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted towards this practical function.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_02
 Then I think the easiest thing to do is work on each task separately.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_02
 The findings that I got very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_02
 In my opinion, infrared is the best way to do that because you don't need a sight line. That's one thing we're going to work on.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_02
 The user interface is critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that converts the electrical energy into data, which then goes through the infrared.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_02
 The chip that I think Ian is designing is going to be crucial. Really, it all comes down to the user because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_02
 The components that we find here are the energy source, the battery, or whatever that's going to make it work. Then the chip, which converts the data, the user that's controlling the chip, and the infrared bulb that's going to let us move the data to the receiver.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_02
 So you have four main components, and they are designed sort of like this. You have your energy source right there, which then brings energy or information to the chip, which is also controlled by the user.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_02
 So you have energy going to the user who is controlling the chip. It's not what I wanted to use. Use that thing down that you can go back previous.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry about that, guys.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, let's just get back to my skin out of care.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_02
 Double click on it with the right with the left hand one. Yeah, I am. I think it's frozen here. Don't show me that.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_02
 There we are. Sorry about this, guys. I'm kind of pathetic with things like this.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_02
 All right, so you have your energy source, your user interface, who's controlling the chip, the chip also uses the energy, and the chip through the use of the user interface is going to control the switch, which will work your infrared bulb, which will then bring the data to the receiver.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_02
 So hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way. This is the parts of the working design that need to be figured out.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_02
 And personal references, besides the fact that I can't spell, we need a long lasting energy source. People don't want to be changing it a lot.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_02
 We need a chip that works well with the user interface that isn't too complicated.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_02
 We have straightforward interface like Ian was saying, simple, not overwhelming it with information, and we need a reliable and clear infrared signal, so that you're not waving your remote around it, having to get frustrated and go do it by hands.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_02
 That's pretty much it for the working design.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_03
 Excellent.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_02
 Let's do you think it can give you a hint of this? Yes, absolutely.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_04
 I can never tell what to turn these things. Lefty Lucy, righty, tidy, right?

0:20:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. Lefty Lucy, righty, tidy.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yes.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_00
 I think about every time.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_04
 It's going to be a lot of fun.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_04
 It's going to be a lot of fun.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, no, Lucy. Yes. Okay. Requirements. We have a couple of new requirements that I was just emailed right before the meeting that we have to keep in mind as we're creating this.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_04
 We didn't bring it up yet, or at all in the meetings so far, but we're not going to work with teletext because that's been taken over by the internet, so we're not going to worry about that.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_04
 That's how it was passed. It's a pressure state. No.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_00
 Would you care to explain it?

0:21:42	SPEAKER_00
 We have a number of numbers in the network. We have numbers in the network control. We type in the page number once. We type 100 and we have a control. This kind of index is on the television screen.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_00
 We have numbers in the network control.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_02
 We have a lot of numbers in the network.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_04
 We're not going to work with that.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_04
 We're also going to, like your question earlier, whether this is going to be for television video or et cetera, just for television.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_04
 That's what we're focused on. Otherwise, it becomes too complex. We want to get this out very quickly. We only have a short amount of time.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_04
 Finally, this is more marketing. Our corporate image has to be recognizable. While we're going to make it look pretty, we need to use our color and our slogan in the new design.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_00
 What's our corporate image like? It's kind of yellow color.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_04
 It looks like a yellow and black. We have the emphasis on the R's. We put the fashion and electronics. We have to keep that in mind.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe some buttons could be yellow. We can play around with it a little bit. We need to talk about our functions and our target group.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_04
 We decide who our target group is. You, in your analysis of the marketing, identified that different groups wanted different things or had certain preferences.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_04
 For example, that older people didn't really care for voice recognition, but younger people did. Who are we aiming at?

0:24:15	SPEAKER_02
 If we're going to say that function of fashion, we put the fashion and electronics, then automatically I think sort of younger group, that's who's going to be attracted to this.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_04
 We have to think who's going to have the money to buy it. It's going to be 25 euro, remember. It has to be marketable to whoever it is.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_00
 This is something that's going to be something that's going to be something that's going to be something that's going to be developed in the way that we market.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_04
 What we're doing is deciding on just the remote itself. It will probably be sold separately. 25 euro by itself.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_01
 The only breakdown that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation. Basically, there's a big jump after 35. People don't really care if it has voice. It's basically 15 to 35.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if I'm going to be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later, but if that's the only quality that we have that is divided into age, then we would want to stick between the 15 to 35 range.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_02
 That's probably a population of quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway. That might be a fairly good target group for us.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_04
 Those are all specific for speech recognition. Are we going to use that as one of our functions?

0:25:43	SPEAKER_00
 I would say no, because it's going to have too many people in the press. Especially if we are marketing, it's something that we can again be doing.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_00
 But we've got a 5-limit with 12, 12, and a half euro.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_00
 To produce it?

0:26:02	SPEAKER_00
 To produce it, yes.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_00
 I want to get a voice that we mentioned in the 12, and a half euro. We've got nothing to do with another company.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_01
 But what else are we going to put? I mean, not that I'm really going to hold about it. I don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_01
 So other than just making it look good, how is it? I mean, it can look really great and still have the same up and down button than mine, then we're going to buy a new remote.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_02
 Why are we aiming for a technological advancement? Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple, and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_02
 I think it could just be mine. It could mean not. If they might be overwhelmed with remote that have too many buttons and too much technology.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_01
 If someone's looking to buy a new remote, don't they want like an upgrade? I don't know.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_04
 Upgrade? Well, we can look at upgrade or we can look at user friendly.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, simplification. It could have a crapper remote that came with our TV that's just impossible to use, or maybe it broke, or maybe they're just missing it.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_04
 And we also need to talk about if we're only going to have the very simple ones, or also have the other ones just separate somehow.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, this might be too complicated, but I wish I had some way to explain it.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_01
 Like, if it was just a simple either the swear of the swear that had the main buttons and then you could pull something out kind of and you got the rest of the button, but the rest of them went in.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_00
 Do you know what I'm saying? I can pull out of the side. Yeah, like some TVs that have a smart screen, I'm going to like control the lines of the complicated buttons.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_00
 But you want to do something complicated, so that you can tell the difference between it and you open up this little hatch, you want to slide it down and then you can just press the button.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_01
 Because then like people who don't want to ever look at them never even have to see them. And if you get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it, then you'll never even know that those things can pull out.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_01
 And you're a happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes, one that has the easy ones and one that has more complicated ones.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_03
 That's a good idea.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_04
 We have to be careful that that doesn't impede the chip transmitting information.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_04
 But that's going to be mostly technological thing.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so what are we emphasizing in this project?

0:28:31	SPEAKER_04
 Simplicity and fashion.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, those are very good goals, I think, that we have to keep in mind with everything we do. Simplicity and fashion and or usability, however you want to say that, which includes an emphasis on making the infrared very functional so that you don't have to travel around a lot.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_01
 What can you do to make the infrared more functional? Why would it not be? I think it's a lot to do with battery, but that's just my battery.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_02
 And that I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well without sort of scattering. So it's just the quality of a chip.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think so.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_02
 The quality of all the components really, we can't really do anything. Shall we work? It's going to be a physical tell in the live.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_04
 So our target group, we're saying 15 to 35?

0:29:33	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I don't know how useful that number is if we're not doing voice recognition.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_04
 Which I kind of I kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in our remote control. Like it might be necessary for a TV, but not for the remote.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and it might be too expensive.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_01
 And if the whole idea is you're using a remote, then why would you have a voice? Like you would need a remote, you would just talk to your TV.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, maybe I mean, if I get more numbers, I'll email you before the next meeting in terms of ages, but this doesn't divide up anything.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_01
 And there was only 100 subjects also, which isn't, I mean, really, it's not representative, especially if it's 100 subjects, they then can subdivide into age groups.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_04
 That means a very few in each age group. So I think regardless, we're aiming for the under 65 or something under 65. Okay, that's a good start.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_04
 I'd say where can we narrow down to maybe teenagers and families?

0:30:40	SPEAKER_02
 Because that would go up to like 50 professionals or something.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_04
 It's hard to narrow down.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think you're out right now.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_00
 I think the fact that it's not built across the board by a device, and we said simplicity is one of the features.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_00
 So it's going to appeal to people. Maybe people who have problems with technology, they don't really get that.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_00
 And that might be older people, but then we've also got passion, which is something that definitely is.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_01
 Well, maybe we don't have to define this hard group by the demographic of the age. We're defined by the demographic of how much money they have to spend or something like that.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_01
 That's a good one. Obviously, that's to be someone who owns the television.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_01
 And how recently have they bought their television? Like that sort of thing.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe it's more useful to just find objectives, like passion, simplicity, then to find specific target group as far as ages.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_04
 Because yeah, things will different will appeal to different people.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, there are a couple of functions.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_04
 Do we want something so that do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost?

0:31:56	SPEAKER_04
 Like a button on the TV, you can press in it or ring or something. I don't know. Like, or beep.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_01
 I guess I before 50% of the frustration someone could have that was the biggest one and half people said that happened. And we all mentioned it before.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_01
 We knew about it.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_01
 And if we're talking about making something easy, that sort of goes along with it. So it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_01
 It would be relevant like the overall goal.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, we have to we have about four minutes left to define our functions. So let's do that quickly.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_04
 So we want something to keep it from getting lost.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_04
 And we want.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_04
 We want large buttons for the essential things.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, large, accessible buttons for the essentials.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_04
 We want a possibility to get.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_04
 Possibility to get the extra functions.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_00
 Which kind of hidden away in some way.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_00
 We're not hidden.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_00
 They're not as prominent as the main.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and we also want it to be fashionable, which I'm not sure if that's a function so much as a.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not like an ice or.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_04
 Do any other essential functions that we need battery? Do we need a long life battery use?

0:33:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but I think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_01
 But we never have to change that.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_00
 We should.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_04
 I would imagine just because it is an electronic device.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_02
 I think it does. I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_02
 Without one.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_02
 But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_02
 Or like a little cradle for your iPod.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe do that instead.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_02
 So you don't have a rechargeable battery.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know. That might contribute to less people losing it too.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_02
 It stays one place.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_04
 I think about space in the rooms too.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_04
 Would you put it on top of the TV?

0:34:43	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, that's a good idea.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_04
 We'll keep it.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_04
 Let's just off the top of the head.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to conclude now.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_04
 As everyone said, their functions.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_04
 After the meeting, we're going to each complete questionnaire in the summer's summary.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_04
 And then we'll have our lunch break.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_04
 After that, we have 30 minutes of individual work.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_04
 I'll make sure to put the minutes in the project documentation and including this PowerPoint slides.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_04
 If everyone could do that as well, that'd be great.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_04
 You have individual actions.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_04
 ID, industrial design.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_04
 If your components concept, user interface, the user interface concept, market trend watching.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_04
 And then you can get specific instructions from your personal coach emailed to you.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_04
 Hopefully, I hope next time you'll be able to access more of the website that they seem to tell you that you could.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_04
 It's kind of frustrating, but you should note any frustrations or any issues that come up in your summary.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_02
 That sounds good.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_04
 Great to know.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_02
 That's good.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_01
 Did you, um, were you able to, like, put yours in the group folder?

0:36:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_02
 I just did that.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_02
 Hopefully it is there for people.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:36:15	None
 Yeah.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_04
 It looks like there are, um, looks like there's a second one kind of mine.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_04
 That I didn't do.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_04
 It's from like an earlier project, I think.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_04
 So, okay.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_01
 Where is that?

0:36:28	SPEAKER_04
 Under the shared folder.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_04
 It might not even be under your.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_02
 So in there, we have technical functions, presentation, working design, presentation, and the functional requirements.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_02
 At least that's right.

0:36:39	SPEAKER_01
 I have three.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_02
 I just have like R three.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_04
 That's what I have as well.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_04
 You don't have mine.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_01
 No, but that's because I think yours is in the email separately.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_01
 It's not on the server.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_01
 But if I open it and then save it, probably will be there.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_01
 I'll wait and I'll remind you can't save.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I'll figure that out in the meantime.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going.

0:37:10	None
 Okay.
