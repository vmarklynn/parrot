0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, this is our final meeting, the detailed design meeting.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_02
 And again, I'll take minutes, but what we have to get through in this meeting is, firstly, the prototype presentation for you two, so you can show us what you've been looking at diligently. There's my way call.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_02
 Then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_02
 Then I need to say since a few things about finance, because we have to check that it's within the finance criteria.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_02
 And then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria, Cat and the financial limit.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_02
 And then we will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_02
 So we've got 40 minutes.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_04
 And then we get to make it a little more comfortable.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_02
 Because we missed out.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_02
 So, it's now, I guess that was the start of 15.35.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_02
 So we've got until 4.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_01
 How much do we have?

0:01:30	SPEAKER_01
 40 minutes.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, about 4.15.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_00
 So, yeah.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, go for it.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_03
 Do you want to?

0:01:39	SPEAKER_03
 So, is it, are we starting with a, yeah.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_03
 So, will you maybe start with like the shape and things?

0:01:47	SPEAKER_03
 And then I will explain the user interface.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_03
 Things like the buttons and the screw.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so, basically going without a trend of vegetables.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_01
 And we selected the color and approximate shape of banana.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_04
 So, basically it's the flip open thing again.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_02
 So, we have the, okay.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_01
 Marika would explain user user interface here.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_01
 And it flips open on the side.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_01
 So, it opens like that.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_01
 And we have the user interface.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_01
 In here and the LCD and the screw on the inside.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_01
 Well, everything else is probably using the face.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, things made of rubber.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_03
 It is, yeah.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_04
 Is it yellow? Do you think you make it a bit smaller?

0:03:05	SPEAKER_03
 It could be made a bit smaller.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_03
 And of course it would be shiny.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but one thing we actually kind of forgot while designing it, one side was supposed to be rounder.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_03
 So, is it the backside round?

0:03:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_01
 But it's in the smith of rubber anyway.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's good.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it does look like the fence like curvy and then the whole shapes curvy.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_04
 I would say that this curvy is quite like a vegetable.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_03
 And it's spongy as well.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_03
 I would say, Keenan.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_03
 So, are they using the face as we discussed last time on the, on the cover, we just have the very basic things.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_03
 So, we have the channels here starting from one, two, three.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_03
 There would be numbers on the actual one.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's four up to four up to seven up to nine and zero here.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_03
 And zero here.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_03
 And then, well, this is on off button.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_03
 It's quite standard place for it and also the color is quite often red.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's kind of user friendly.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_03
 And then this one would be for flipping the canals back in like the previous one and the next one.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_03
 And we would also have a little thing saying here, previous and then, a preven, preven next.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_00
 So, where's the volume?

0:04:23	SPEAKER_03
 The volume is scrolling on the side.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_03
 You just did it like this.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_03
 And, and it's on the back cover or back lid because if you flip it open, you can still do the scrolling here.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, Keenan.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_03
 See.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_03
 So, the volume is, you just scroll, but then once you flip it open, okay, there you have the screen.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_03
 And you have the spinning wheel with options to choose.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_03
 You can move back and forth and then if you need to choose something on the screen, you just push the send in the middle button.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, the thing we forgot was like a mute button.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_03
 A mute button.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_01
 We would not put that in.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_03
 We'll have this on the screen, on the display.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_01
 So, on the cover, we have the bare essentials.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_04
 On the wheel, if you peel down, then it will.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_01
 On the LCD, you know, the main one you will have with this option.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_03
 But the, yeah, the scrolling is kind of, you have to scroll on the way to make it mute, right?

0:05:18	SPEAKER_03
 But if you're all the scrolling click, isn't it?

0:05:20	SPEAKER_04
 That's the scrolling click.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_03
 Cool.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_03
 So, that's why I was a whole mutitian.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_03
 And okay, so, so the voice recognition is also just part of it.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_03
 You can't really see it in the face.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's hidden in there.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_03
 And we do have the logo.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_03
 Very good.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_02
 So, I think, and it's with the black and yellow and the red and the black color.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_03
 So, yeah, I think we could do the logo in gray as it is on the website.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_01
 You can have a question.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_01
 Let's have a look.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_02
 Let's have a look.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_02
 So, it's sort of intermediate color.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_04
 Oh.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_04
 It is beautiful.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_04
 Cold and slimy.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_04
 I hate K-Day.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_04
 It's just mingled.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, that's cool.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_04
 Very good.

0:06:19	None
 Okay.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_02
 So, maybe if we go on to evaluation criteria and then we'll...

0:06:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_02
 I suspect we're going to have a couple of minor finance issues.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sure we can get around them somehow.

0:06:35	None
 Okay.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_02
 We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_02
 We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some of the places that we're in.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_04
 Wales.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_04
 Wales, for example.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:07:05	None
 Okay.

0:07:06	None
 Cool.

0:07:07	None
 Cool.

0:07:08	None
 Cool.

0:07:09	None
 Cool.

0:07:10	None
 Cool.

0:07:11	None
 Cool.

0:07:12	None
 Cool.

0:07:13	None
 Cool.

0:07:14	None
 Cool.

0:07:15	None
 Cool.

0:07:16	None
 Cool.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_04
 So, we're going to be using the seven points scale.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_04
 So, one is, you know, yes, it totally meets what that requirement.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_04
 And seven is, no, it really doesn't.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_04
 We need to go back and start again.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_04
 You know, basically what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_04
 You know, so that we can evaluate each one and like, so it's about going back to the start and saying, oh yeah, we did manage to do that or I know we really forgot that.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_04
 So, these are what they are.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_02
 So, for each of these, we need to give it a one to seven.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_04
 I did have a BC and D down here, but it seems to have turned into like just blood on.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_04
 Never mind.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_04
 But if you can imagine that they say ABC and D, that would be really good.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_01
 I guess we'll give it maximum points and everything.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's definitely attractive.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I agree.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_03
 That was a locatable thing we actually forgot.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I thought you'd kind of said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the TV.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_02
 Shall I just prepare one now?

0:08:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_03
 I would be right too.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_04
 So, be attractive to look at.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_04
 That's this one.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_04
 What do you all say?

0:09:17	SPEAKER_03
 Seven or something, the maximum, yeah?

0:09:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_03
 I go for seven.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_03
 It's terribly good.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_04
 We're also proud of the palette.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_04
 So, that'll be a seven.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, no, you can't walk.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_04
 That's up there.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_04
 What I've done on the next page is I've set it up.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_04
 So, we just put the marks in.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_02
 Excellent.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_02
 Except we can't.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_02
 But that's all right.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_02
 I can take notes.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_02
 I'll take notes.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_04
 It's fine.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_04
 So, we're all agreeing on seven.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_04
 Does it match the operating behavior of the user?

0:09:51	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, I think it does.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_01
 The only thing that we were considering was that this thing is kind of more for right hundred people than for left hundred people.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_01
 So, if you're left hundred, you kind of left.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_03
 And we might want to do like another model, another version which is like exactly the mirror image of this one.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_02
 That's going to be a problem because you don't always have all left-handed or all right-handed in a family.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's not a huge problem because it is a breakable.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_03
 But then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_04
 So, they just, yeah.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_04
 But I mean, because it's not like it's a pen, you know, left-handed people can't normally write, right-handed, but they can normally do most things, right-handed.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_04
 I would say it's not such a big issue.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because I mean, anyway, right-handed people would be able to start with it.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_03
 So, if you've got majority, right-handed it's-

0:10:41	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, you can't mean your finger to scroll other than your thumb. Yeah.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_04
 So, I mean, that does kind of negate the whole RSI issue.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_04
 So, maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_04
 I'll give it a five, I would say.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_04
 What do you, what do you think?

0:10:55	SPEAKER_03
 Or maybe six because it's just one, one, one of them.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_02
 I think, I mean, most people are right-handed.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_02
 So, in terms of our greatest target group, I think it's pretty good.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_02
 One more thing is that- The target for management might want to- Okay.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_01
 It might be a little clumsy when it opens up, right?

0:11:14	SPEAKER_01
 It opens in the side.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_03
 No, yeah, but we have it nicely with a hinge or a wood-hole.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_03
 So, it won't be a problem, it will be- And it will be- it won't be heavy.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_04
 I think the alternative is flippings in the top.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but it's a bit long.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_03
 It's a little bit long.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I mean, it can be open like this, of course.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_04
 But you were thinking about making it smaller, yeah?

0:11:38	SPEAKER_00
 This kind of makes more sense.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_01
 So, you have to keep- I have to interfere with the IR channel.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but if we flip it open only as much as that.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_04
 So, it works like a mobile phone flipping, but, you know, as long as that side is flat, then that will work.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_04
 So, see, are we admitting defeat on sea or are we saying we're going to sticky-locate on the table?

0:12:06	SPEAKER_04
 No, we have a look here.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_02
 There's a locator.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_02
 Cool.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_04
 So, that means- I just checked on TV.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_04
 That doesn't mean you need to speak on it, though.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_04
 Doesn't it?

0:12:14	SPEAKER_04
 Let's make it beep.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, but the sample speaker is included, so it has some capacity to do- Yeah.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_03
 To make some sounds.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_03
 So, yeah.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_04
 So, you see that?

0:12:24	SPEAKER_04
 Seven, yeah.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_04
 So, I'm going to go to the table.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_04
 Fabulous day.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 Intuitive, completely intuitive.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_03
 If this means intuitive, if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's- Yeah.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's-

0:12:40	SPEAKER_02
 It's six. Because the- I mean, the standard layout for numbers is three, three, three, and one, rather than the way you've got it.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_02
 I really like the way you have it.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_02
 It's not the immediate thing that you're used to.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 I mean- And even the scroll- It's a new technology, so it might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginning.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_01
 So, it is kind of not very intuitive, but it's a good technology.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_02
 But it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_04
 So, should we maybe say a five and say it is intuitive, but it's different.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_04
 So, yeah.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_04
 Do you know, I mean, it's obvious how to use it, but you might have to think about it first.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_04
 So, we give that one a five, do you think?

0:13:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_01
 I'm glad you're accepting this.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_04
 I have taken a little while, haven't it?

0:13:28	SPEAKER_04
 Intuitive.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_04
 But- Sorry, it's really hard to write on this.

0:13:33	None
 I just went a bit mad.

0:13:37	None
 Okay.

0:13:38	None
 Cool.

0:13:39	None
 E.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_04
 I guess this comes back from this whole beat.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_04
 Links in here.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_04
 So, possibly for left-handed.

0:13:58	None
 Investigate.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yep.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_02
 But otherwise it's superb.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_02
 So, she give it a six.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_04
 Six.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_04
 Six.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_03
 The agronomic design, well, I mean, I don't know.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, the repetitive stress things, but then who would be really pushing the button so much on the remote control anyway?

0:14:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_01
 Unless you are all the time sitting.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's kind of- Yeah.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_03
 I think it is a text today.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_04
 You know, and I never got prepared in Australia, and I enjoy from that.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_04
 So, I find it quite hard to believe.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_01
 And moreover, it has LCD and everything so that we minimize the pressing of the buttons.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_04
 So, we give that a six.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_04
 F.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_03
 That's awesome.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_03
 Absolutely.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know how to make showing up with the things there, but it only has bullet points there.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, that's the second one.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_02
 So, you must have changed it on this one where it's got score, but not on the previous slide.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, okay.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_04
 It has voice control.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_04
 That's a seven, man.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_01
 The most sophisticated mode that I've ever seen.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_02
 But in terms of the actual technology, none of it is actually new.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_03
 We have the sample speakers as well.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, all of the components have been used in other things before.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_03
 But at the same time, they all relatively new.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_04
 They've never been using remote control before any link.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_02
 What do you reckon?

0:15:40	SPEAKER_04
 Five, six.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_04
 What do you think?

0:15:43	SPEAKER_03
 Six.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_03
 Six.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, how far can you go with a remote control?

0:15:46	SPEAKER_03
 Really?

0:15:47	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that's it.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_03
 It still has to do with what it has to do.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_04
 But I mean, everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really, haven't it?

0:15:56	SPEAKER_04
 See?

0:15:57	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think many of you have space remote.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_02
 They can take you to put fashion in electronics.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_02
 Absolutely.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_01
 Isn't it special?

0:16:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, sure.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_01
 The Carrick banana.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_01
 It's the maximum fashion.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_03
 We give it through the vegetables with our fashionable base days.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_03
 There we go.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_04
 So I think we've done very well.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_03
 Very good.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_04
 We need the average here.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_04
 So you go...

0:16:21	SPEAKER_03
 The average is about six and something.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_03
 A little bit over six.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_03
 Seven.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_03
 There are how many?

0:16:29	SPEAKER_03
 No, wait.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_04
 A little bit under six.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_04
 Twenty-eight.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_04
 Three-sixes.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_04
 And one-five.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_04
 Eighteen.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, three-sixes.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_01
 Thirty-eight.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_01
 Thirty-eight.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_01
 Four-sevenes.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_01
 Forty-six and five.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_01
 Six point.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_03
 Twenty-one.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_02
 Twenty-one.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_02
 Five.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_02
 That's six point five.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_02
 Six point five.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_04
 Close enough.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_02
 That's pretty good, I think.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_02
 I'll wait until we get to finance the money.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_02
 If we can afford it.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_02
 That's all you've got at the moment.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_02
 Did you have anything there?

0:17:03	SPEAKER_02
 No, that's it.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_02
 So finance.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_02
 And we'll see if we can...

0:17:10	SPEAKER_02
 Unscrew this test.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_04
 Cool side.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_04
 So, I think we're going to just take...

0:17:26	SPEAKER_04
 There we go.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_04
 There we go.

0:17:34	None
 Another mark.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_02
 Beautiful.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_02
 Not anymore.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_01
 You have to wait for it.

0:18:19	None
 There we go.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_02
 And now we have to calculate the production costs.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_02
 So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_02
 Can you read that?

0:18:43	SPEAKER_02
 Almost.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, that's...

0:18:48	SPEAKER_02
 I started feeling it in.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_02
 But of course, these are provisional, so we have to go down.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_02
 No hand dynamo, right?

0:18:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_02
 One simple battery.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_02
 No kinetic energy, no solar.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_02
 The chip we're going for an advanced chip on print.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yep.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_02
 Single curved surface, so that we can unfold with this case material.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_02
 This material was said rubber.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what special colour means.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
 Anything which is not one of those.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_03
 I think this is probably special colour.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but rubber comes colour.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_02
 I would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood colour.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_03
 Or maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_04
 Let's leave it as well.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, you might end up having to take off.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_02
 So we have screw wheel with push pattern.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we have for muting.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_03
 And we have LC display and buttons, supplements.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:20:08	None
 No.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_03
 We don't know.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_01
 We don't know.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_03
 We don't know.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_03
 We don't know.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_03
 We don't know.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_03
 We don't know.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_02
 We don't know.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_02
 We don't know.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_02
 I think maybe it's integrated with the LC display.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, let's see.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, well, we want a push button.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_04
 I think the push button...

0:20:30	SPEAKER_02
 So then you have...

0:20:31	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know if that's one.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_04
 That means you can only have 25 push buttons in total, in that not counting anything.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_02
 Still be in budget.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_01
 That seems unlucky.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_02
 What is the limit?

0:20:42	SPEAKER_02
 Whether push button means that we have to count all the colours.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think so.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_01
 No, it says what is the kind of interface.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_01
 If it is push button, then you get a 0.5, it's a scroll wheel.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_01
 So we put its push button and scroll wheel and LCC display.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_01
 So that's the three kind of interfaces that we have.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_02
 So as we can see, that's way too expensive.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_02
 What's our strategy?

0:21:12	SPEAKER_02
 Some are budget, so 12.5.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_04
 The sample center will have to go because that's the most expensive thing.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_02
 So that has implications for the...

0:21:24	SPEAKER_01
 It does not have four voice recognition, but it does have for the feedback speaker.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_01
 When you press one, it says hello.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_04
 That's a bit of a gimmick anyway.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_01
 And the locator also goes away.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_03
 But it was very innovative.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_03
 So we're innovating this.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_03
 Well, this sample speaker is expensive, but we could just have some very easy device that just beeps.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_02
 Because the sample speaker was, I think, more complicated than it would be.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_03
 There you record your samples.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_01
 Also, in the case, I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface, because it's just rubber.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_01
 So it's probably a flat surface rubber.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, yeah.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_04
 So we need 150 off.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_04
 See, I was going to say the scroll wheel push button thing,

0:22:26	SPEAKER_02
 because take it down to just a scroll wheel.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_01
 So that would mean that we cannot press. Then we would be in level project.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_01
 If in the LCD we can scroll, right?

0:22:39	SPEAKER_01
 How do we make a selection if you cannot push it?

0:22:41	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no, you can push this one, but we don't have a push button.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have this muting mechanism for this scroll.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_04
 But that's where you just have to just put it down.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_02
 You can have to scroll it straight down.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_02
 So that's point three.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_01
 But hey, it's the scroll wheel.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_01
 I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and push button thing.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_03
 But I mean, we can put an additional mute button on the top as well.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I mean, that wouldn't actually cost anymore.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_04
 That's the spin wheel, though, isn't it?

0:23:11	SPEAKER_04
 That can be the LCD.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_02
 That comes with the LCD?

0:23:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_02
 We decided because it's not on our list.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_01
 So this is...

0:23:20	SPEAKER_02
 The scroll wheel is on the side.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_01
 So we are adding costs for both of them, right?

0:23:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, I mean, I think it's the good.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_02
 So we're point three over over at the moment.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_04
 And then we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have push button to the volume.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_04
 You can still put them on the side.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I mean, the scroll wheel is pretty cool, but...

0:23:48	SPEAKER_01
 Instead of scrolling here, we have two buttons here, off or up and down.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_01
 Sounds good, actually.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, rather than having three different things that people have to do.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_02
 There we go.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, look, we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll get bonuses.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_04
 And we could admit to the single curve in the circle, could we?

0:24:08	SPEAKER_02
 Or that we have to have some sort of special colour.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_02
 So that's all right.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_02
 We'll leave it at that.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'll take it back to management and say, we weren't quite sure about the colour of that cost extra, that we've still got some space for it.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_02
 We have, yeah.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_02
 Excellent.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_02
 So did we lose on our evaluation criteria?

0:24:34	SPEAKER_02
 Is that a little bit of a problem?

0:24:35	SPEAKER_02
 No, I'm not really, you know.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_01
 Because we keep all the features, we keep voice recognition, we keep LCD display.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_01
 Instead of having scrolling, we just put...

0:24:46	SPEAKER_01
 We just got rid of a gimmick that we never know anyway.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_04
 And the scroll wheel is, I mean, essentially the two buttons.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_04
 That is not very different.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_01
 But we lose the locator.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have a beep.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_03
 We are going to have a beeping thing.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_00
 So instead of speaker.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's not like sample speaker, but it will just beep.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_03
 So we still have the locator.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_04
 That's not a very exciting colour.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_04
 I think you should make it more vegetable-like.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_03
 Much colour, the colour of the phone or the colour of the...

0:25:18	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, the beeper thing.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_03
 It can be yellow as well.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_03
 It can come in the same colour as the case.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_02
 We won't have run out of our pocket later.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think General wants it to vibrate.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_04
 You know, your pen vibrates.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I know.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but I don't think it's a very short time.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_02
 So it looks like we designed a banana.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_02
 We've just got about ten minutes or so left at the meeting.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_02
 So it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_02
 So that we can feed back to the management for the next time they designed the product.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_02
 Cool.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_02
 Feedback, I do.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I'm as far as creativity is concerned.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_03
 I think that was wrong for creativity.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_03
 The only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the budget we had.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_01
 I think one thing that was lacking was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_01
 And we kept adding things randomly.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_01
 So, how do you know?

0:26:39	SPEAKER_04
 If we had the beginning, we should have been like, OK, we can have that a lot.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we can see what we can.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_01
 So all the random decisions at the end could have been entered.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_02
 But in terms of the process of going and working individually and then coming back to the meeting, that works.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_04
 I think it would mean to say regular, you know, it wasn't like we were alone for very long.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_04
 So you didn't go off and think, wouldn't it be great to have a bomb rating?

0:27:12	SPEAKER_00
 I would have a big drop.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_04
 Shape like a banana.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_04
 And then, you know, you come back three days later and you're like, look, if I've been waiting, it's like a banana.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the means were very, very good.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_03
 The means we used the whiteboard digital pen.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_04
 I like the pens.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_04
 And I think it's the only one that would just be so cool to do.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, he could take it to lecture and just write stuff down.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_02
 I wonder what one of these costs.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_04
 Do you think I've noticed if one may?

0:27:49	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe you should see that was the recording.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_02
 But that worked well having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the power point.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_02
 I find that the problem with power point often is that it's so static and you can't change it once.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_02
 It is a bit weird.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_03
 And this time also, the time limits that actually preparing the...

0:28:12	SPEAKER_04
 Nothing flew in.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_04
 You didn't have the whole swoosh-ing thing because it wasn't time for that.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_04
 That's all right.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_04
 But always it would.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_04
 Not that you can do that on the board either.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_04
 It would make some...

0:28:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I mean, already just preparing the slides before the whole day.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I mean, now it's fairly tight anyway.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, especially with that last minute alteration.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_04
 You can see any brackets.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_04
 This is just hard to be changed.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_04
 And yeah.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_04
 It's a cool thing.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_04
 We're supposed to say nice things about Jen.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_04
 I'm pushing.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_04
 You know, moving's a nasty thing.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_04
 I was satisfied with my leadership.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_04
 You won't like it addictating you, that's always good.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_02
 You have to say that because I'm taking the next clip.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_02
 And then you've got the pen.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_04
 What time do you think?

0:29:01	SPEAKER_03
 And then the teamwork, I think it works quite nicely.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_02
 Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to express them?

0:29:13	SPEAKER_01
 I guess it was a fairly small group.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_01
 So all of us got to express our opinions.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's a pretty new, pretty novel solution for most control really.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_03
 All this flipping open thing.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think you're shopping for my control.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_03
 But I've never seen anything.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_03
 And none of my examples were like this.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_04
 I'll be looking at how many people are next.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_04
 I'll be exploring.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we could have a patent on this one.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_03
 Patent patents.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_04
 I think we'd like to think the idea is we need, but we've got no way of finding it.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_02
 You can always go to Google and type in banana remote control.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_02
 I can't even worry.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_04
 I've just came up with like a thing to learn.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_02
 True.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_02
 So costs are within budget.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_02
 Within budget.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_02
 Including a little, what have we got?

0:30:32	SPEAKER_02
 One euro left over.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_02
 It fits that we didn't possibly.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_02
 We've evaluated.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_02
 A project.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_02
 And you've got the scores.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_02
 Can you put that in the project documents?

0:30:47	SPEAKER_02
 It's in the project.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_02
 And the process we all didn't really have any major problems with.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_02
 Was there anything that you found difficult or anything that didn't go as smoothly?

0:31:01	SPEAKER_03
 One way difficult was the time pressure.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_04
 Otherwise.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_04
 Sometimes it's like a little bit less.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_01
 I thought that was good though because if you're given too much time, then you've got nothing to do with your time.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_01
 Although we could have made the Rs better how we have time.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:22	None
 Okay.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_02
 I think we're still there within a...

0:31:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_02
 We've got about five minutes left.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_02
 But if we're finished, then we're finished.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_02
 Which is too efficient.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_02
 We should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_02
 So I would say that's the end of that meeting.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_02
 It's a pleasure working with you.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_02
 It was very productive day.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_04
 And four animals on the board again.

0:31:57	None
 Oh no.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think so.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_03
 It can make some animals.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_03
 Are you dead, why?

0:32:04	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_04
 It's just me and it smells so bad.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_03
 That's it?

0:32:09	SPEAKER_03
 It smells quite nice.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_03
 It smells very sweet.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_02
 So we have to complete the final question here, meeting summary when they...

0:32:20	SPEAKER_02
 Is there a question I've already sent?

0:32:21	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if it's already sent or not.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_02
 No, it was a bit.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_02
 I'm pushing over there.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_04
 Do we have to go back into the other room or put this thing in?

0:32:27	SPEAKER_02
 I don't see why we can't stay here really.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, it's moving.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if you can say this thing.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_02
 I'm glad.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_03
 I made your animal for you.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_03
 It was supposed to be pink.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but it was blue.

0:32:47	None
 It was blue.
