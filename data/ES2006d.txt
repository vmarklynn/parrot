0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 This is our final meeting, the detailed design meeting.

0:00:11	SPEAKER_02
 Again, I'll take minutes.

0:00:15	SPEAKER_02
 What we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from the presentation, so it's what you've been looking for.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_02
 There's a record that in Kat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this again.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_02
 Then I need to say since a few things about finance because we have to check that it's within the evaluation criteria and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria, Kat and financial limits and then we will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_02
 We think so, we've got 40 minutes and then we get to make it a link in the comments.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_02
 We missed out.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_02
 It's now, I guess that was the start of 1535, so we've got until 4.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_01
 How much do we have?

0:01:30	SPEAKER_01
 49.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, about 40 minutes.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_02
 Until about 4.15.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_03
 So, yeah.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_03
 So, are we starting with the shape and things?

0:01:48	SPEAKER_03
 Then I will explain the user interface and things like the buttons and the screw.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_01
 Basically, going without trend of vegetables and we selected the color and approximate shape of banana.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_04
 You think the banana is the same to you, is it a bit of a panic?

0:02:13	SPEAKER_02
 Well, but it's just an approximation.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_02
 Do you use perfect?

0:02:18	SPEAKER_02
 No, you were making fault.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_01
 Basically, it's the flip-open thing again.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_01
 We have the, okay, the Mark covered, we'll explain user interface there and it flips open on the side, so it opens like that and we have the user interface in here and the LCD and the school inside.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_01
 Well, everything else is probably user interface, so.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_02
 And it's the whole thing made of rubber.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_03
 It is.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_03
 It's made of a small and, of course, it will be shiny.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but one thing we actually kind of forgot while designing it, once I was supposed to be rounder, so it's at the backside.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_01
 Well, since it's made of rubber anywhere, I think it's here.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_04
 It does look like the front's like curvy and then the whole shape's curvy, so I would say that it's curvy.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_03
 It looks quite like a vegetable.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and it's spongey as well.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_03
 So, the user interface, as we discussed last time, on the cover, we just have the very basic things.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_03
 We have that channel, so you're starting from 1, 2, 3, there would be numbers on the actual number.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's up to 4, up to 7, up to 9 and 0.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_03
 And then, well, this is on off button.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_03
 It's quite standard place for it and also the colour is quite often read, so it's kind of user-friendly.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_03
 And then this ones would be for flipping the channels back in like the previous one and the next one.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_03
 And we would also have a little thing saying here, previous and the preven, preven next.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_00
 Where's the volume?

0:04:23	SPEAKER_03
 The volume is scrolling on the side.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_03
 You can't see it.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_03
 You just did like this.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_03
 And it's on the back, cover or back late because if you flip it open, you can still do the scrolling here.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, can I see.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_03
 So, the volume is you just scroll, but then once you flip it open, there you have the screen.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_03
 And you have the spinning wheel with options to choose, you can move back and forth and then if you need to choose something on the screen, you just push the middle button.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, the thing we forgot was like a mute button.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_03
 A mute button.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_03
 We will have this on the screen, on the display.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_01
 So, on the cover we have the barest and feels.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_04
 On the wheel, if you hold the wheel down, then it will.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_01
 On the LCD, you know, the main one, you will have the...

0:05:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the scrolling is kind of, you have to scroll all the way to make it mute, right?

0:05:18	SPEAKER_04
 But if you hold the scrolling click, isn't it?

0:05:21	SPEAKER_04
 It's a scrolling click.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's a whole mute issue.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_03
 And okay, so the voice recognition is also just part of it you can't really see it in the interface.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's hidden in there.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_03
 And we do have the logo.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_03
 Mm-hmm.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_03
 Very good.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_02
 So, I think...

0:05:40	SPEAKER_02
 And it's with the black and yellow in the right hand.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_04
 So, yeah.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_03
 I think we could do the logo in grey as it is on the website.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_01
 And you have all the resources here.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_02
 So, if you have questions, there.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_02
 I have a...

0:06:00	SPEAKER_02
 Test it out.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_02
 I can count.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_02
 I can count.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_02
 And so, it's an intermediate color logo.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, no, no.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_04
 I hope you can see it.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, that's cool.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:06:19	None
 Very cool.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_02
 So, maybe if we go on to evaluation criteria.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_02
 Again, we'll...

0:06:25	SPEAKER_02
 I suspect we're going to have a couple of minor financial issues.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_02
 We'll see.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sure we can get around them somehow.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_02
 We'll just send all of them and the factory into some nice poor country.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_02
 I'll cut some of the plastic that one.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_04
 Wales.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_04
 Wales for example.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:06:59	None
 Okay.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:07:05	None
 Okay.

0:07:08	None
 Okay.

0:07:11	None
 Okay.

0:07:14	None
 Okay.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_04
 So, what we're going to do is prepare the evaluation of the new design.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_04
 So, we're going to be using the 7.0 scale.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_04
 So, one is, you know, yes, it totally meets what that requirement.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_04
 And 7 is, no, it really doesn't.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_04
 We need to go back and start again.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_04
 You know, basically what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_04
 And we've worked on it and made a list of them.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_04
 You know, so that we can evaluate each one and like, so it's about going back to the start and saying, oh, yeah, we did manage to do that.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_04
 Or, I know we really forgot about that.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_04
 So, these are what they are.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_02
 So, for each of these, we need to give it a 1 to 7.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_04
 I did have a BC and D down here, but it seems to have turned into like just a lot of things.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_04
 Never mind.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_04
 But if you can imagine that they say A, B, C and D, that would be really good.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_01
 I guess we'll give it a maximum point in everything.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah, it's definitely attractive.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I agree.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_03
 That was a locatable thing we actually forgot.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I thought you'd kind of say that you'd have a little thing to stick on the TV.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_02
 So, I just prepared to prepare one now.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_03
 I've got the grid too.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_04
 So, be attractive to look at.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_04
 That's this one.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_04
 What do you all say?

0:09:17	SPEAKER_03
 Seven was the maximum, yeah.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_03
 I go for seven.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_04
 It's terrible.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_04
 We're also proud of the calendar.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so that will be a seven.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_04
 I know you can't watch that up there.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_04
 What I've done on the next page is I've set it up, so we just put the marks in.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_02
 Excellent.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_02
 Excellent.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_02
 We can't.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_02
 I'll take a note.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_02
 I can take a note.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I'll take a note.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so we're all agreeing on seven for eight.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_04
 Does it match the off-wasting behavior of a user?

0:09:53	SPEAKER_00
 I think it does.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_01
 The only thing that we were considering was that this thing is kind of more for right-hundred people than for left-hundred people.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_01
 So, if you're left-hundred, you kind of like a...

0:10:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_03
 So, in some way, we might want to do like another model, another version, which is like exactly the Mirai match of this one.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_02
 That's going to be a problem because you don't always have all left-hundred or all right-hundred in a family.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's not a huge problem because it's not a problem.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_03
 I think left-hundred people are already used to discrimination anyway, so they just...

0:10:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but I mean, because it's not like it's a pen, you know, left-hundred people can't normally write, but they can normally do most things, what I'm saying.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_04
 I would say it's not such a big issue.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because I mean, anyway, right-hundred people would be able to show up.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_04
 And if the majority are right-handed...

0:10:42	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, you can't have any finger to scroll rather than you thumb.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_04
 So, I mean, that does kind of negate the whole RSI issue, so maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_04
 I'll give it a five, I would say.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_04
 What do you think?

0:10:55	SPEAKER_03
 Or maybe six, because it's just one in one of our visions.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think for, I mean, most people are right-handed, so in terms of our greatest target group, I think it's pretty good.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_02
 And I think it's one of the planets for management they want to...

0:11:10	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_01
 It might be a little clumsy when it opens up, right?

0:11:14	SPEAKER_01
 Or it opens on the side.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_03
 No, yeah, but we have it nicely with a hingeship or whatever.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_03
 So, it won't be a problem, it will be...

0:11:25	SPEAKER_03
 And it won't be heavy.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_04
 I think the alternative is flipping from the top.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but it's a bit long.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_03
 It's a little bit long.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_04
 It can be opened like this, of course.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_04
 But you were thinking about making it smaller, yeah?

0:11:40	SPEAKER_01
 This kind of thing makes more fun.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_01
 So you have to keep...

0:11:43	SPEAKER_01
 So you have to keep...

0:11:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but if we flip it open only as much as that.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_04
 So it works like a mobile phone flipping, but you know, as long as that side is flat, then that will work.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so see... oh, are we admitting defeat on C or are we saying we're going to stick a locate on the T-Low?

0:12:06	SPEAKER_04
 No, we have a look at that.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_02
 There's a locate at C.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_04
 Cool, so that means...

0:12:10	SPEAKER_04
 I've just checked on TV.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_04
 That doesn't mean you need to do the speak on it, right?

0:12:14	SPEAKER_04
 You know, make it beep.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, but the speak...

0:12:17	SPEAKER_03
 Simple speakers included, so it has some capacity to do...

0:12:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_03
...to make some sounds.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_04
 So, yeah.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_04
 So, that's seven years.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yep.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_04
 Fabulous.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_04
 D.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 Intuitive, completely intuitive.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_03
 If this means intuitive, if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's...

0:12:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's six.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_02
 Because the standard layout for numbers is 3, 3, 3, and 1 rather than the way you've got it.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_02
 I really like the way you have it.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_02
 It's not the immediate thing that you used to.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 And even the scroll, it's a new technology, so it might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the...

0:13:01	SPEAKER_01
 So, it is kind of not very intuitive, but it's a good technology.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_02
 And it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_04
 So, should we maybe say a five and say it is intuitive, but it's different.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_04
 So, yeah.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_04
 Do you know, I mean, it's obvious how to use it, but you might have to think about it first.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_04
 So, we give that one a five, do you think?

0:13:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to give a seven and everything, so...

0:13:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_04
 I'm glad you were accepting this.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_04
 I have taken a little while, haven't I?

0:13:29	SPEAKER_04
 Intuitive to put...

0:13:40	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry, it's really hard to write on this.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_04
 I just went a bit mad, didn't I?

0:13:44	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, cool.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_04
 E.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_04
 I guess this comes back from this whole B thing links in here.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_04
 So, possibly for left-handed.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_04
 Investigate.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but otherwise it's superb.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_04
 So, she give it a six, six, six.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_03
 The ergonomic design, well...

0:14:13	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I don't know.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, the repetitive stress things, but then who would be really pushing the button so much on the remote control anyway?

0:14:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, unless you are all the time sitting.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so it's kind of...

0:14:29	SPEAKER_04
 I think it is an honor.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_04
 I think it is an effective text today.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_04
 And I never got the positive strain.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_04
 I can enjoy from that.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_04
 So, I find it quite hard to believe, you know?

0:14:36	SPEAKER_01
 And moreover, it has the LCD and everything, so that we minimize the pressing of the buttons.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so we give that a six, yeah.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, have a watch.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_03
 That's how it happens.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, absolutely.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_04
 I want to have a make-sharing up with the things there, but it only have bullet points there.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, that's the second one.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_02
 So, you must have changed it on this one, where it's got score, but not on the previous slide.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, okay, cool.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_04
 So, it has voice control?

0:15:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, so that's a seven, then.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_04
 Three, and a little bit more.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, and a little bit more.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_01
 It's the most sophisticated mode that I've ever seen.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_02
 But in terms of the actual technology, none of it is actually you.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we have the sample speakers, which is...

0:15:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but I mean, all of the components have been used in other things before.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_03
 But at the same time, they're all relatively new.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_04
 They've never been used in remote control before, I didn't think.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_02
 What do you reckon?

0:15:39	SPEAKER_02
 Five, six.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_04
 What do you think?

0:15:42	SPEAKER_04
 Six.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_03
 Six.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, how far can you go with a remote control, really?

0:15:46	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it still has to do with what it has to do.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but I mean, everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else, really, hasn't it?

0:15:55	SPEAKER_04
 I think many people face remote.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_04
 That is it.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_02
 They can take it with them.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_02
 Put fashion in electronics.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_01
 Absolutely.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, isn't it?

0:16:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, sure.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_01
 The carrot banana.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's a little bit of a facet.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_03
 We give it some fruits and vegetables, and our fashionable days days.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_04
 There we go.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_04
 I think that's a hundred.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think we've done very well, but...

0:16:18	SPEAKER_03
 Go.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_04
 We need the average here.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_03
 The average is about six and something.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_03
 A little bit over six.

0:16:26	None
 Seven.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_03
 There are how many six?

0:16:29	SPEAKER_03
 No way.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_04
 A little bit under six.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_04
 That's 28.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_04
 Three sixes.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_04
 And one five.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_04
 18.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, three sixes.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, yeah.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_01
 28, 38, 4, 7, 6.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_01
 26 and 5.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_01
 The C1.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_01
 61, the way it goes.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_03
 Six point something.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_02
 That's 6.5.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_02
 Six point five.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_02
 That's close enough.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_04
 That was pretty good, I think.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_02
 Now, I'll wait until we get to the final.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_02
 If we can afford it.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_02
 That's all.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_02
 You've got at the moment, or did you have anything there?

0:17:03	SPEAKER_02
 No, that's it.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:17:07	None
 So, finance.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_02
 And we'll see if we can...

0:17:15	SPEAKER_02
 Unscrew this first.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_04
 Cool, sorry.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_04
 There we go.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_04
 I'm just saying.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_04
 It's good.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to get in there in the month.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_02
 Beautiful.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_02
 Nothing to do.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:17:40	None
 Okay.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_02
 Is it nice and tall?

0:18:02	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:18:10	None
 Okay.

0:18:13	None
 Okay.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:17	None
 Okay.

0:18:18	None
 Okay.

0:18:19	None
 Okay.

0:18:20	None
 Okay.

0:18:21	None
 Okay.

0:18:22	None
 Okay.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_02
 So, we looked at the project at presentation and the evaluation criteria.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_02
 And now, we have to count.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_02
 We have to calculate the production costs.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_02
 So, I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_02
 Can you read that?

0:18:43	SPEAKER_02
 Almost.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_02
 No, less.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_02
 I started feeling at the end, but of course, these are provisionals that we have to go down.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_02
 No hand dynamo, right?

0:18:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_02
 So, we have a simple battery, no kinetic energy, no solar.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_02
 The chip we're going for an advanced chip on print.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yep.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_02
 Single curved surface.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_02
 So, that we can follow this.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_02
 Case material is said rubber.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what special colour means.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_01
 Anything, I think, which is not more than one.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_03
 At least in colour, yeah, probably.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think this is probably special colour.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but rubber comes.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_02
 Rubber comes.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_02
 I would maybe it's like if you want titanium colour, or wood.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_03
 Or maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_03
 Let's leave it as you're.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_04
 You might end up having to take off.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_02
 We definitely have to show it up.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_02
 So, it's a pushback.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_02
 And then we have scroll wheel.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_02
 That's why scroll wheel with pushback in my head.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we had from using, yeah.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_03
 And we have LC display and buttons, supplements.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_03
 We're not giving any more.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but we have LC display, but the, the, the, the, the

0:20:16	SPEAKER_02
 the spinning wheel. Spinning wheel.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_02
 I think, yeah.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it's integrated with LC display.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_02
 I feel like it's a pushback in there.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_02
 I think the push button.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_02
 Oh.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_04
 Because then you have, I don't know if that's why.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, you can only have 25 push buttons in two to do that.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_04
 Not counting anything.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_02
 So, remember that.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_02
 That seems unlikely.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_01
 What is the limit?

0:20:41	SPEAKER_02
 Whether, whether push button means that we have to count all of the fashion, not doing.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think so.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_04
 No, it says what, what is the kind of interface?

0:20:51	SPEAKER_01
 If it is push button, then you got a 0.5.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_01
 It's a scroll wheel.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_01
 So we put it's push button and scroll wheel and LC display.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_01
 So that's the three kind of interfaces that we have.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_02
 So as we can see, that's way too expensive.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_02
 What's our budget?

0:21:11	SPEAKER_02
 12.5.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_02
 The sample sensor will have to go.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_02
 Because that's my sister's sister's.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_04
 So that's the three kind of interfaces that we have.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_02
 That has implications though for the.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_01
 It does not have four ways recognition, but it does have for the feedback speaker.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_01
 Not when you say, when you press one, it says one or it says hello.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_04
 But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_01
 And the locator also goes away.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_03
 But it was very innovative.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_03
 And then it's a way innovative.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I mean, this speaker, the sample speaker is, it's expensive, but we could just have some very, very easy device that just bapes.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_02
 Because the sample speaker was, I think, more complicated.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_01
 There you record your samples.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_01
 Also, in the case, I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface because it's just rubber.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_01
 So it's probably a flat surface rubber.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_01
 I mean,

0:22:13	SPEAKER_00
 okay.

0:22:14	None
 Yeah. So we need 150 off.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_04
 See, I was going to say the scroll wheel push button thing,

0:22:25	SPEAKER_02
 because take it down to just a scroll. Yeah.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_01
 That means that we cannot press.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, then we will be in the budget in the LCD.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_01
 If in the LCD, we can scroll right.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_01
 How do we make a selection if you cannot push?

0:22:41	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, you can push this one, but we don't have a push button.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have this muting mechanism for this scroll wheel.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_04
 But that's, well, you just have to just be in it down.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_02
 You can have to scroll it straight, roll it straight down.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_01
 So it's the scroll wheel.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_01
 I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and push button thing.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_03
 But I mean, we can put an additional mute button on the top as well.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, that wouldn't actually cost anymore.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_04
 That's the spin wheel, isn't it?

0:23:11	SPEAKER_04
 That can be the LCD.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_02
 That's with the LCD.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_02
 We decided because it's not on at least.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, so this is...

0:23:20	SPEAKER_02
 The scroll wheel is on the side.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_01
 So we are adding costs for both, right?

0:23:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's the good.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_02
 So we're pointing to the other, right?

0:23:33	SPEAKER_02
 I think we are at the moment.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_04
 Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have push button to the volume.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_04
 We can still put them on the side.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, the scroll wheel is pretty cool, but...

0:23:48	SPEAKER_01
 Instead of scrolling here, we have two buttons here of wrap and down.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_01
 On the side.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_01
 Sounds good, actually.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, rather than having three different things that people have to do.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_02
 There we go.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_02
 I'll look way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll get bonusy.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_04
 And we'll be kidded met to the single curve this time for me.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_02
 Or that we have to have some sort of special colour.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_04
 So that's all right.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_02
 We'll leave it at that and then I'll take it.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_02
 I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour if that costs extra that we've still got some space for.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_02
 We have.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_02
 Excellent.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_02
 So did we lose on our evaluation criteria?

0:24:34	SPEAKER_02
 Is there a bit of a problem?

0:24:36	SPEAKER_01
 No, I'm not really.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_01
 Because we keep all the features, we keep voice recognition, we keep LCD display.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_01
 Instead of having scrolling, we just put it in the...

0:24:46	SPEAKER_01
 We just show a bit of a gimmick that there's never now anyway.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_04
 And the scroll wheel is, I mean, essentially the two buttons that is...

0:24:52	SPEAKER_04
 is no way different.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_01
 But we lose the locator.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we are going to have a beeping thing.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_00
 So instead of a speaker.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's not like sample speaker, but it will just beep.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_03
 So we still have the little key.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_03
 That's not a very exciting colour.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_04
 I think you should make it more vegetable-like.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_04
 Much colour, the colour of the phone or the colour of the...

0:25:16	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, the beeper thing.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it can be yellow as well, it can come in the same colour as the case.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_03
 We won't have run out of that.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think Jen wants it to vibrate.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_04
 You know, your pen vibrate?

0:25:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I know.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_04
 I know.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_04
 But I think it's a very short one.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I know.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_02
 So it looks like we designed a banana.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_02
 We've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_02
 So it would be good if we could just have a little talk about their project itself and how it went so that we can feedback to the management for next time the design of the product.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_02
 Cool.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_02
 Feedback, I do.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, as far as creativity is concerned, yeah, I think that was the room for creativity.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_03
 The only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the budget we had.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_01
 I think one thing that was lacking was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_01
 And we kept adding things randomly.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_01
 So how do you know?

0:26:39	SPEAKER_04
 If we don't have the sheet at the beginning, you should have been like, okay, so we can have that option.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, or not.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_01
 We can't.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_01
 So all the random decisions at the end could have been.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_02
 But in terms of the process of going and working individually and then coming back to the meeting, that works.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_04
 I think it was a regular, you know, it wasn't like we were alone for very long.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_04
 So you didn't go off and think, wouldn't it be great to have a fine meeting?

0:27:10	SPEAKER_04
 I think we could talk.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_04
 And then you know, you come back, we need to attend.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the means were very good.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_03
 The means we used.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_03
 The whiteboard digital pen.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_04
 I like the pens.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_04
 I want one.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_04
 That would just be so cool to do.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_02
 You know, you could take it to lecture and just black stuff down.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's what I wanted to do.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_01
 I wonder what one of these costs.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_02
 Do you think that node is a one name?

0:27:47	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe you should say that was the recording.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_04
 It can work at my computer.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_02
 But that worked well having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the powerpoint.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_02
 Because I find that the problem with powerpoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_02
 It is a bit too late.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and this time also the time and the way to actually preparing them.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_04
 The thing flew in, you didn't have the whole pushing thing.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_04
 There wasn't time for that.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_04
 That's the right, otherwise you would have to do that on the board either.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I mean already just preparing the slides before the meeting.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, totally.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, that was fairly tight anyway.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, especially with that last minute alteration.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, you can see the brackets.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_04
 This is just had to be changed.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_04
 And yeah.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_04
 We used to say nice things about Gen.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_04
 You know, moving so nicely.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_04
 I was satisfied with what we did.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, definitely.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_04
 You weren't like it, a dictating reader.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_04
 I was always good.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_02
 You have to say that because I'm taking the note.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_02
 I believe the Roman.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_02
 I know you've got the pen.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_04
 You want a tag here.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_03
 And then the team walker saying, I think it works for it nicely.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, to anyone feel that they were getting covered up and not being able to express them.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_03
 I guess it was a fairly small group.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_01
 So all of us got to express our opinions.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's pretty new, pretty novel solution for most control really.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_03
 All this flipping open thing.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't know I'd be shopping for my controls.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and I would never see anything.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_03
 And none of my examples was like this.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_04
 I'll be looking up next time on Instagram.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_04
 I'll be exploring.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_04
 I'll see you.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we could have a patent on this one.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_03
 Patent, patent.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_04
 I think we'd like to think the idea has been evil.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_04
 We've got nowhere to find it.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_02
 Or you can always go to Google and type in the Nana remote control.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_02
 The library.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_02
 The library.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but that would just come up with like, things with nothing.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_02
 True.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_02
 So costs are within budget.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_02
 Within budget, including one of the got one euro left over bits that we didn't foresee.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_02
 We've evaluated the project.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_02
 You've got the scores.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_02
 Can you put that in the project documents?

0:30:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, in the project.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_02
 I'm already and the process we all didn't really have any major problems.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_02
 Were there any, was there anything that you found difficult or anything that didn't go as smooth as?

0:31:01	SPEAKER_03
 My mind difficulty was the time pressure otherwise.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, sometimes it was like a little bit less.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_01
 I thought that was good though because if you're given too much time, you've got nothing to do with your time.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_01
 Although we could have made the R's better had we had playing on the internet.

0:31:22	None
 Yeah.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_02
 I think we're still low within a...

0:31:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we've got that time there.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_02
 We've got about five minutes left.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_02
 But if we finish, then we're finished.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_02
 Which is too efficient.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_02
 And we should never drag a meeting on just because we have extra time.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, so I would say that's the end of that meeting.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_02
 It was a pleasure working with you.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_02
 It was a very productive day.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_04
 We could draw animals on the board again.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_01
 Oh no.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think so.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_03
 It can make some animals.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_03
 Are you dear mate?

0:32:03	SPEAKER_04
 No, it's just me and it smells so bad.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't?

0:32:09	SPEAKER_03
 It smells very sweet.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_02
 So we have to complete the final question there, meeting summary when they...

0:32:19	SPEAKER_02
 Is there a question there already?

0:32:21	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if it's already sent or not.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_04
 Do we have to go back into the other room?

0:32:27	SPEAKER_02
 I don't see why you can't stay here.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, it's here.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_02
 I'll make your animal free.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_03
 It was supposed to be pink.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but it was blue.

0:32:47	None
 I don't know if it's pink.

0:32:57	None
 I don't know if it's pink.

0:33:04	None
 I don't know if it's pink.
