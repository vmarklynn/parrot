0:00:00	SPEAKER_04
 We have little or head, so.

0:00:05	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so the microphone adjustments we should check.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_04
 Would you check the microphone adjustments please?

0:00:09	SPEAKER_04
 Is this, is this, is this is this is close enough?

0:00:12	SPEAKER_04
 Can we look at, can we look at, can we also get the, you, what you said about it? Is it close enough?

0:00:16	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, all right.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_06
 Hello?

0:00:18	SPEAKER_06
 I can change it.

0:00:19	SPEAKER_04
 But you know, he's like the expert and I don't know exactly.

0:00:22	SPEAKER_00
 So about a thumb and a half, maybe two thumb.

0:00:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:00:25	SPEAKER_00
 It's the weight from your mouth, so that's a little far.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_00
 Oh.

0:00:28	None
 So, I'll show you the corner.

0:00:30	None
 Thumb as in this way.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_00
 Just, just, so it should be very, very, very good.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_00
 And then you can look on screen and if you see, right, right, right, right, right, in other words, when you're free, then if you see it going up and down a lot, then move it a little further away from the front of the nose.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_04
 It's interesting.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_04
 That's good.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_04
 Hello?

0:00:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_04
 Your voice is so, so it's like, you can see across all the channels when you talk.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_04
 It's great.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_04
 Thanks very much.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_04
 Thanks very much.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_04
 So, welcome back.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you for coming.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_04
 So, what I thought we'd do today is pick up where we were last time and maybe go over some ideas about, well, the return to the conventions, but I also wanted to share with you a couple of the things that I picked up in terms of checking.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_04
 And these are things that came up with the tiger fish transcus.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_04
 I'm just doing this because I think it's interesting.

0:01:27	None
 Okay.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_04
 So, an example.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, shit.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_04
 So, there are a couple of examples.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_04
 I have one in front of you, which is the one where, Leah noticed this one where I said something and the transcribe or interpreted it as two-some gruesome different sizes, different this.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_04
 And actually what I meant to say was, so you're saying groups of different sizes, different size groups.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_04
 It's really enormously far away.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_04
 Now, this could be one of those cases where the auditory was just really bad.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_01
 That's what I was just thinking.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it was really quiet or something.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe very soft.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe with the microphone noise or something from someone else or an overlap or, but they're not usually that bad, I don't think.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_04
 Then I have a couple of others.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_04
 So, there's one.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_04
 So, the person said interesting idea, but tiger fish thought it was just an idea.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_04
 Now, that changes the meaning.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_04
 It's interesting.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_04
 And then there are various ones like, Ish-Dk instead of H-Dk.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_04
 And then this one.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_03
 Ish-Dk.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_04
 Ish-Dk.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_04
 Now, Ish was in parentheses.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_04
 What's the Ish?

0:02:47	SPEAKER_04
 They were suspicious that wasn't right, but that was the closest they could come.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_04
 And you know, when you're dealing with acronyms, that shows one of the problems with acronyms.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_04
 It's clear if you know it.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_01
 I wonder if someone who had an accent, maybe.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, it's conceivable.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_04
 I don't remember offhand.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_04
 I did check the example.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_04
 And, well, and this is to be consistent.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_04
 So, it was transcribed as with H, but it was really with age.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_04
 And then there are some where actually punctuation changes the meaning.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_04
 So, these are things that Barber showed.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_04
 Spurts wouldn't be right, was what it looked like.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_04
 But actually, when he listened to it, they would be.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_04
 Spurts wouldn't be right.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_04
 Oh.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_01
 That's very subtle.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_01
 It is subtle.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_04
 And instead of, and it's, they put Annets.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_04
 And this is interesting because it's like, you know, we know that there's no Annette on any of the meanings we've ever dealt with.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_04
 But it's conceivable.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_04
 And then, let's see, there's one other here that was interesting.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_04
 Well, this was, okay, so it should have been the calls, the calls slides will be fine.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_04
 This is Jerry Feldman.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_04
 And instead it was transcribed with the, and then an uncertain syllable, the, the.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_04
 And then all the slides will be fine.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_04
 Which is interesting.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_04
 And, you know, this was a case where the time been was off.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_04
 I wanted to bring an example where the, yeah.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_04
 So all the slides, it was started too late.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_04
 It's another case of de-voicing at the initial.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_04
 So, I hope that was very interesting.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_04
 And I think that it shows, these sorts of things, I was thinking of being interesting to do an analysis of these things.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_04
 Because I think that, first of all, there's this overall point that it shows the degree to which, when you listen to speech and when you're just in general listening, probably.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_04
 It shows specifically to this task that it's very constructive.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_04
 You're not going on simply the auditory.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_04
 There's a huge contribution from the top down processing.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_04
 And, you know, at different types, you've got the contextual information.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_04
 You have syntax, you have your mastery of English and these various things.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_04
 But I think these kinds of errors, it just shows the degree which is not strictly an acoustic task.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_04
 And the other thing I think that's interesting is the types of, the types of confusions that happen, do preserve certain aspects of the stimulus.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_04
 So, the stress tends to be preserved.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_04
 The content word will be substituted for another content word.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_04
 And it's not surprising that they would hear this.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_04
 I'm often surprised by how plausible something can be without it being correct.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_04
 Because it really seems like it's, and then often, you know, there's, the parentheses are used, so the person knew it wasn't really a perfect match.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, now having said that, I'm impressed by how, how infrequent these kinds of extreme cases are.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_04
 Most of the types of things that I find in checking are much, much more mild.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_02
 So, actually, that comes back to a point.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_02
 We had talked about this last week.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_02
 You were interested in so, saying so at the end of something.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_02
 And sometimes it would get transcribed as, okay, so let me just think of an example.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, let's say I say, well, that would be hard to do so.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, right?

0:06:09	SPEAKER_02
 And the way I would transcribe it, I would put that, so that would be hard, comma, so.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_02
 And yeah, it's kind of just the end of it.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_05
 Would you put a period after so?

0:06:19	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_02
 You would or you wouldn't.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah, yeah, I was just sort of end it.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_02
 But then sometimes they transcribe it like, so that would be a problem, period, new word, like capitalized.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_01
 Like it's a whole new utterance, like it's not connected.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_02
 Right, and it just seems to sort of like totally, that's not the meaning.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_02
 And it changes the meaning, I think.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_04
 And, so, let me be sure I understand.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_04
 So, you're saying, that's boys hard to ignore that word.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_04
 So, the example is, that would be hard.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_02
 Or whatever, yeah, that would be a problem, whatever.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_04
 So.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_04
 And how does it change the meaning?

0:06:57	SPEAKER_02
 What are the two different meanings there?

0:06:59	SPEAKER_02
 It seems like, because if I was just reading that thing, I would say, so that would be a problem.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_02
 So.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_02
 You know, I mean, if it was done like period capitalized.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_02
 I'm just saying as opposed to, that would be a problem.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_02
 So, that would be a problem.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_05
 I think the second one where this so is all by itself, it's like, so that would be a problem.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_05
 So.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, the first one is like, the so is connected to the sentence.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_05
 And that would be a problem.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_05
 But the next one is like, not connected to that would be a problem.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_05
 It's like introducing.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, let's.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_02
 Right, yeah.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_01
 The first one too is more like, to me, I don't necessarily put a period after that.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_01
 So, I might actually either put a dash after it, depending on whether or not they got interrupted or something.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_01
 Or I would maybe even act as though they were just trailing off.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_01
 So, put those two dots after it.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_01
 I do that too.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_01
 Which depending on what's going on, like I'll do that.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_01
 Because to me, it sounds more like they're trailing off.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_05
 Sometimes though, it does sound like they ended a sentence.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, yeah.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_05
 Like sometimes it's just like, that'd be hard, so.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_05
 Right now.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_05
 And then often it sounds like they were trying to think of something else to say, but they couldn't really, you know.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_05
 And then they get interrupted and then I put a dash.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_05
 But I never usually put a period and then new words so unless it's like end of the sentence and then.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_01
 So.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_01
 What are we going to do now, but they don't say that.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_04
 It's interesting that there are so many cases and I agree.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_04
 I think those are very good conventions.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_04
 Also, this whole point about how the fact that you're raising this, I like this example, that we have several things that are being queued by intonation.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_04
 Right. Because if that's a nice, far-following intonational contour on, that's a problem.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_04
 And that'll be a problem.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_04
 Then I would think that this should be a period there.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_04
 And then especially if you've got a pause following it, but you don't always see these things are correlated, but they're not.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 That's another thing is if you're not a native speaker of English, you might not pick up because, you know, every language has different intonation methods.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_05
 That's always one of the hardest part about the native speakers.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_05
 As you don't know exactly how to do the punctuation because their intonation is totally different.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_05
 You mean non-native.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, non-native speakers is learning it.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_01
 Absolutely.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_01
 And also if you're a non-native speaker transcribing it, you wouldn't necessarily understand the conventions of English intonation.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_01
 You know, intimately, as a native speaker, might have native speaker transcribers.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_04
 I do. I wouldn't have to be something.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_04
 I do it would be nice to have a spaniard transcribing it.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, you mean?

0:09:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's not what I meant, but that would be cool.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_01
 What I meant was that I would hope that for meetings in English, you would have native speakers transcribing it because you would have more intuitions about what should be there.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_01
 Even if you can't fully understand the word, you can make a guess you can do.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_01
 That isn't completely off like some of these are, but they're pretty rare.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 Those things, the really bad mistakes that they make are pretty rare.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_04
 So in terms of when you're going through the tigerfish transcribers, you don't find a lot of these kinds of extreme cases.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_01
 Not this much.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_01
 Not too some gruesome.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_01
 Not too some gruesome.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_01
 Sometimes, but they tend to be pretty good about parentheses.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, sometimes they usually put them in parentheses that they cheer yourself.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_05
 You were way off, but at least you do it your way off.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_02
 I just wonder what influences something to think of to some gruesome, maybe this person just saw horror movie or something.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_02
 This is the interpretation that came to mind or something.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_02
 You know what I mean?

0:10:40	SPEAKER_02
 Where would you get the word gruesome?

0:10:42	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_01
 You just sort of pull it out of the air.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I mean, you get the GR from groups, I guess.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know where the rest of it came from.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_05
 Groups have gruesome.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_01
 If for some reason they didn't hear the F, if they didn't hear the F, it might just sound like, yeah, gruesome.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's both.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_01
 You know, and then you would kind of have to come up with some sort of consonant and maybe it's an M to you.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_01
 Well, also, because also, I mean, F is, is, um, I don't know where the P went, though.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe the P wasn't pronounced right?

0:11:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_01
 Well, like groups of.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, because it's, um, by label, too, you know, you'll, uh, or interdental, if, you know, it's close enough, I guess, to, um, you know, getting the closure of the lips.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe that's what they were getting.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_01
 It's possible.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_04
 Well, you know, it's also this problem that they didn't have context to constrain the interpretation.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, that's really hard to not be able to go and listen to the other channels and figure out the context of what's occurring in.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_04
 When I'm clearing the parentheses, I find that very useful.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_04
 Sometimes I try to just go through and pick up the parentheses, see if I can do it just by itself.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_04
 But it's remarkable how sometimes something can be so totally opaque and then you go back to, you know, the person's previous utterance, you go to the mixed channel or you, uh, check on the other things and suddenly becomes perfectly clear.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_04
 It's very, very surprising.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_04
 Very surprising.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_02
 But this other business, um, that you have at the bottom with people getting transcribed on another channel.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_02
 Is that what it's about?

0:12:33	SPEAKER_01
 It's much more common.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_01
 I wasn't, I couldn't, I don't know, for some reason that didn't make sense to me, but that's about when things are transcribed on other channels.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_02
 What's always funny to me is when it's, you know, they miss the gender completely like, you know, more going to be on Jane's channel or just something bizarre like that.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_01
 Um, so maybe it's because they don't realize that you're supposed to do, I mean, maybe they don't really realize that you're supposed to split it up or say like, maybe they think, well, I hear it just as clearly.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_01
 I hear this other person's voice just as clearly and I realize it's not Jane and I realize it's not a female even.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_01
 But, um, because it's so clear on this channel, I'm supposed to do it.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_01
 I'm supposed to transcribe it.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_01
 I imagine that that might be what that is.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_01
 And if you don't even know how many people are at the meeting or anything.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's really an odd task in a way because they have no clues at all about how dominant the speaker is on the channel of transcribing.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_04
 And the presigment doesn't give them any information either.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_04
 I'm sure that it's because of the, wow.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_01
 We're really spoiled then with that interface.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_01
 Fancy, yeah.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_01
 Fancy.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's very useful.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_02
 If I was going to make just a guess, though, my experience, it would seem like the men get missed.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_02
 The men get moved on to other channels maybe more frequently and it's just probably because they have deeper voices and they're getting picked up on more channels.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_04
 That would make that would make some sense.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_01
 That would make some sense.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_01
 Or they just tend to.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_01
 It's an acoustic thing.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_01
 That's true. That's the louder, man.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_01
 They do say that men's voices carry better.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, that's why they use, like, I think, who's talking about Ian Madison was talking about this, that they use male voices.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_01
 And male voices in airports.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_01
 Because the acoustics of it just fits into the hearers' minds.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_01
 And that's what I'm saying.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it fits into a hearers' range of perception better than a lot of female voices.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_01
 And so that's why they use male voices.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_01
 We're just talking about that.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_01
 We're just talking about that.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_01
 Because it's hard to hear.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_01
 I have those strange computerized voices.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, those are actually probably just the computer problem, not the gender problem.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_04
 So this means that people with hearing problems would hear one of these announcements better if they're male voices.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, depending on their auditory capabilities.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, if their auditory capabilities have been, you know, squished down in a certain place where it would be easier for a person with normal hearing to hear a male's voice.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_01
 Like I'm saying, if they had some sort of, you know, damage to part of their brain that processes auditory information, then if that part of the brain normally codes for, you know, male voices in a normal hearer, then they might not be able to, you know, does that make sense?

0:15:22	SPEAKER_01
 Like if that part is damaged. But yeah, I guess from most hearers, it's just easier.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_01
 And it's like a certain kind of rough male voice to kind of grass-beer, or raspian.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_01
 It's better.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_04
 It's better.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_04
 That's wider ban, then.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it might be from the...

0:15:41	SPEAKER_04
 She asked this question last time, which was whether our system here, the recording system, may have some of the same channel restrictions.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_04
 Such as they ran across when they were looking at telephone transmissions, certain point.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_04
 Because, you know, telephone transmissions, there's some filtering going on. You don't hear the full band of frequencies.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_04
 And I asked a couple of people, and the answer came back that it was interesting.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_04
 It's reminded me because of the comment about noise. Noise being...

0:16:15	SPEAKER_04
 Really spreading frequencies across... using frequencies across a broader spectrum. So in a way, bandwidth can increase with some of these cases of distortion that we have.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_04
 But it's not a useful kind of increase.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_01
 Because there are...

0:16:29	SPEAKER_01
 I was just saying it, you know, sometimes, if you remember, I was saying, like, if there's a discrepancy between fricatives, you know, like, sure, or so, we'll show up in a certain part of the spectrum.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. And oftentimes, foo is, like, knocked out of the spectrum by filtering, or something.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_01
 By filtering some of the older phones.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_01
 So what was the answer here?

0:16:51	SPEAKER_01
 It's not the case.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_04
 That they don't have a reduction in that direction.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_04
 You know, one could have if one had cheaper microphones than we have, but we've got good microphones.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_04
 Now, there is sort of an upper limit set on our bandwidth by the sampling rate. But then it becomes... so Adam says, that then it becomes a matter of, is that something that would be relevant to perceptual range?

0:17:15	SPEAKER_04
 And I didn't really have the sense that it would.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't get that from him, actually.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_01
 I felt like he was basically saying that for all intents and purposes with this, it's covering whatever sounds are necessary to be covered, like everything.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_01
 Good.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_04
 That was my impression also. So we don't have that kind of reduction, like you have in telephone.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_04
 And actually, in the work that they were doing with the telephone corpura, they did run into limitations in certain times that they...

0:17:42	SPEAKER_04
 what their speech recognition approach is because of the filtering.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, it does seem like when I hear these things, except for the distortion parts, where the volume's too high, or of course, when the volume's too low, but that's a different problem.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_04
 Except for those cases, it seems to me that it really is as if the person we're speaking in my ear, I don't feel it is being reduced in any way.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I do too.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_04
 And he was saying in the areas where you have clipping where it's recorded too high and it starts to saturate and you have trouble.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_04
 I thought that was very interesting. So bandwidth then gets actually wider instead of narrower because you have...

0:18:21	SPEAKER_04
 Oh. Yeah. These... you still have...

0:18:25	SPEAKER_04
 Inferno frequencies are represented, but the energy distributions are thrown off.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_04
 And in fact, you have also some additional frequencies. So you end up with a wider bandwidth functionally.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_01
 So like you're saying...

0:18:37	SPEAKER_01
 Not awful for speech.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_01
 In the case of something with clipping, were you saying that it increases to...

0:18:43	SPEAKER_01
 or expands to accommodate that?

0:18:45	SPEAKER_04
 No, technically the bandwidth is wider.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_04
 So it's actually paradoxical in a way, so usually think bandwidth... better bandwidth is better.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_04
 But in the case of distortion, then you can end up with...

0:18:55	SPEAKER_01
 Right, okay.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_04
 A wider bandwidth, which isn't useful in terms of understanding speech.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_04
 So...

0:19:03	SPEAKER_01
 I have a question.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_01
 In some of the earlier meetings, I guess, there was a lot of spikes or what I called spikes.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_01
 I was wondering what that is.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_01
 I don't even know if it's relevant or useful to know.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_04
 One source was there was a problem with a connection where the microphone went into a box.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_04
 I was trying to think if this is prior to... yes, it's prior to the wireless.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_04
 There was a particular connection, which wasn't wireless, which was mechanically bad in some sense.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_04
 And if it got touched, it would send an impulse.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_04
 In a relevant, non-wanted...

0:19:38	SPEAKER_01
 Sometimes where...

0:19:39	SPEAKER_01
 Artifact.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_01
 Extraordinary, bad, and painful.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, absolutely painful.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_04
 Exactly, I agree.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_04
 And that's... you know, I would watch the visual system...

0:19:47	None
...and I would say...

0:19:49	SPEAKER_01
...it's like...

0:19:50	SPEAKER_01
...coming to the volume.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I remember I had one with that, and it was just all... all the time.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_01
 Especially if they also got louder too.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_01
 And they... it was just like...

0:20:01	SPEAKER_04
...oh, fuck.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's really awful.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_04
 You've noticed that those have gotten better over the years.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_02
 Absolutely.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 Sometimes you'll see like something coming up like...

0:20:10	SPEAKER_02
...oh, someone's gonna cough really loudly.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_02
 And I... it's like... it's like...

0:20:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_02
 Or someone's about to laugh really loudly.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_01
 And so you turn it down.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and then you're just sort... you've got like...

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 You know?

0:20:21	SPEAKER_01
 Take one off or something.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_02
 So, I think...

0:20:24	SPEAKER_02
...there's gonna be some speech in there.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's really important.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's really important.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think that's really important.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_01
 Because I generally have the volume turned up...

0:20:30	SPEAKER_01
...to above normal volume, just so I can hear more clearly.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_01
 And if it's like that for someone...

0:20:35	SPEAKER_01
...screaching into the microphone...

0:20:37	SPEAKER_02
...you could really hurt your ears.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_02
 I think you could.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_04
 I think so too, yeah.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_04
 I realize...

0:20:42	SPEAKER_04
 I realize... I... I meant to tell everyone to watch that visual signal...

0:20:45	SPEAKER_04
...because that's... that saved me a bunch of times.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_01
 It's a good clues.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it means very useful and like all senses.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_02
 That's very good.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_02
 Sometimes it doesn't pick up back channeling though.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_02
 And so sometimes you have to try to listen to your visual.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_02
 To your visual, but...

0:21:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you have to... the resolution.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_04
 But it's very useful to talk about the interface for... for a bit...

0:21:08	SPEAKER_04
...terms of what it is that you like, particularly what you don't.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_04
 And kind of thing.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_05
 You know what, I would think would be a really neat feature for the interface.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_05
 Some sort of backwards tab where it could go backwards without you having to...

0:21:20	SPEAKER_05
...go up and do it manually.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_05
 And you press the button and...

0:21:25	SPEAKER_05
...because if you miss something and you want to go back to it, it's such a...

0:21:28	SPEAKER_05
...such a hassle.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_05
 It'd be so nice if there was just some sort of like, you know...

0:21:32	SPEAKER_05
...oppositive tab that you could hit that it would just sort of move backwards.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_05
 There wouldn't even have to be any...

0:21:38	SPEAKER_00
...would play it backwards.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_05
 You know, you wouldn't even have to have the audio.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_05
 That's not... I wouldn't... I mean...

0:21:42	SPEAKER_01
 But just to move back, but not necessarily a whole time been.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_04
 Interesting.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_02
 Right, because sometimes you'll hear it'll be in the middle of the time been...

0:21:50	SPEAKER_02
...and you'll listen to the whole thing again.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_00
 Because you already got in the first...

0:21:53	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_02
 So you just want it to go back.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know why you have to drag it.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_01
 You have to drag it.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_05
 Or you can drag it or like...

0:21:59	SPEAKER_05
 If you miss it, you know, you've got to go back and find it and...

0:22:02	SPEAKER_05
...dragging it and looking for it.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_05
 Or you may not be able to see it even, you know.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_01
 I think that would be useful.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_04
 Interesting idea, Al.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_04
 I'll suggest that to the...

0:22:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the less you have to click on the mouse, I think the faster you have to click.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, because I noticed I started feeling like I was getting some sort of...

0:22:16	SPEAKER_01
...couple-tone wrist problems and stuff.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_01
 Much better now that I have the keyboard tray, but it was...

0:22:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_01
 I think because I had my hand in one position using it all the time...

0:22:24	SPEAKER_01
...that I would... it would crack a lot.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_04
 It's very weird.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_04
 And it's good to be careful about the mouse.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_04
 You're gonna see it.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_01
 Oh yeah, something... maybe I just don't know how to do this.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_01
 But when I want to expand a time bin back, or even forward, I'll use the mouse.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_01
 The middle...

0:22:39	SPEAKER_04
 How do you mean expand?

0:22:41	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, in terms of...

0:22:43	SPEAKER_01
...if it's cut off like the beginning of a nut or something.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not serious.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_01
...to keep the line back.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_01
 And I usually just use the mouse.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_01
 How do you do that with the keyboard?

0:22:51	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, I do that with the keyboard.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I would press the mouse here.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_01
 Tab and listen to where I wanted it to stop.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_01
 And then press return.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_01
 And create a new time bin.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_01
 Or then shift.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_01
 And then shift.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_01
 What do you see just with that one?

0:23:02	SPEAKER_05
 I do it all on the keyboard.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_01
 To me, that takes longer than to do it with the mouse.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, really?

0:23:08	SPEAKER_01
 Because you can just drag.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_01
 You just drag the...

0:23:10	SPEAKER_01
 I never do that for some reason.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_01
 I really do.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_04
 It depends on how much I want to go back and how certain the boundary is.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_04
 If I can see this thing's coming up, and it's just so clear, is that mountain right there?

0:23:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_04
 That all dry...

0:23:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, dragging is really efficient.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_04
 But if it's like a mess in there, then it helps me to be able to locate it with the actual clicking.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_04
 And then do this, whether you were just describing.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_01
 One thing that's gotten me into problems a little bit is having the shift back space as the collapseer.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_01
 Ah, yeah.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_01
 Because I'll tend to delete things or go too far or something.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_01
 Or I'll be holding down shift because I want to type something as a capital.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_01
 And then I'll end up collapsing.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_01
 The collapseer, I just want to...

0:23:52	SPEAKER_04
 If I need to add an option, it might be to have an undo for that.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_01
 I've never used an entire utterances before.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_01
 Or just to change the keys used for that option.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_01
 I'm rather used to it now.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_01
 I'm used to it too but...

0:24:08	SPEAKER_01
 But then when you go to type on your keyboard at home...

0:24:11	SPEAKER_01
 Do do do...

0:24:13	None
...So scared!

0:24:15	SPEAKER_03
 Do you type a capital in there?

0:24:22	None
 I'm going to teach you.

0:24:27	None
 There's the camera, dude.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_05
 I'm going to do that.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_05
 I think of that.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_02
 Oh yeah, I do find that the keyboard is different here than it is even for my school computer.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_02
 And so I'll just be, if I was just at school and I come here, it's just, or vice versa.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_02
 Or vice versa, yeah.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_02
 I'll reach for one key and it'll do something completely different.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_02
 That backspace and those little...

0:24:53	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, the backspace is a little...

0:24:54	SPEAKER_05
 And the little evil apostrophe that keeps showing up.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, you're just keeping on the box locking.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, too, because caps lock is in a different spot.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_04
 So how do you get...

0:25:05	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know the evil apostrophe.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_04
 It's right above the front.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it's what the space is on the keyboards that most of us are probably used to.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_05
 So you're going to pass through your apostrophe.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, I see it.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so this is the difference between the PC keyboard and the sun keyboard.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_04
 So we're probably going to have one versus two of the others.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_04
 Right, so I'm not really used to it now too.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not really used to it now too.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_01
 I'm used to the sun one, I guess now.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_01
 But then, I think there's a different keyboard on...

0:25:32	SPEAKER_01
 I always forget...

0:25:33	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, a winged...

0:25:34	SPEAKER_01
...then on...

0:25:35	SPEAKER_01
 Best money?

0:25:37	SPEAKER_01
 No, the other one.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_01
 I'm righto.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_01
 I'm righto.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_01
 I'm righto has a different one.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_01
 Linguini is Buzz's money.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_01
 I always use a tend to use linguini the last couple times, like you've stolen linguini before I can...

0:25:47	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I'm righto.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_01
 Which is fun.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_01
 But then, like, it takes me a good 10 minutes to get reused to that keyboard.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_02
 And so I can...

0:25:56	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know, you seem very upset about it.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, you're okay.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah, I have noticed it.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_01
 I'll screw some stuff up, like, when I'm trying to use it.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_01
 So which...

0:26:07	SPEAKER_04
 I forgot which one is which.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_04
 So which one do you prefer?

0:26:10	SPEAKER_04
 So if we had a show of hands, how many people would vote for this?

0:26:12	SPEAKER_04
 How many people would vote for the Sun keyboard versus the...

0:26:15	SPEAKER_04
 So let's put it the other way.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_04
 How many people would not vote for the Sun keyboard?

0:26:18	SPEAKER_04
 Would vote for the other one.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_04
 The PC...

0:26:20	SPEAKER_01
 PC one?

0:26:21	SPEAKER_01
 I would...

0:26:22	SPEAKER_01
 PC one is Amarado one, right?

0:26:23	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not sure it's...

0:26:25	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_05
 I'm not sure which one is which.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_02
 I think it used to it.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:26:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_05
 When I first asked for one, I would have definitely wanted the PC keyboard, but now I'm...

0:26:34	SPEAKER_05
 I'm just used to it.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_01
 I prefer the one on linguini Buzz's money.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know what it's got.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, let's do it that way.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_04
 So if we have a map of the room, the one when you first walk in...

0:26:44	SPEAKER_04
 Is Buzz's money.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_02
 Well, the one on the left is the Buzz's money.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's correct.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_02
 Linguini must be the one...

0:26:50	SPEAKER_02
 Linguini is the one on the corner.

0:26:51	None
 Right, that...

0:26:52	None
 Yeah, the one on the right...

0:26:53	SPEAKER_05
 The right corner is the PC.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, that one's got the PC keyboard, and then the two on those sides have the...

0:27:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so basically right as you walk in the door, the one straight ahead of you...

0:27:04	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_01
...is Amarado.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_01
 And the one to the left of that against the far corner...

0:27:10	SPEAKER_01
 Good.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_01
...is Linguini.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_04
 And the one close to you is Buzz's money.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_04
 So now, who would...

0:27:16	SPEAKER_04
 So if you have a strong...

0:27:17	SPEAKER_04
 Now, you're by keyboard also.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_04
 Ah, you're...

0:27:20	SPEAKER_04
...but now...

0:27:22	SPEAKER_04
 Who would prefer the keyboard on Linguini?

0:27:27	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, we got two votes for Linguini.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_04
 And who would prefer Amarado?

0:27:33	SPEAKER_04
 Amarado?

0:27:34	SPEAKER_04
 So we got more multi-keyboardal people.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_02
 I just have no preference.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_02
 That's lovely.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_02
 So, you can sit here.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_02
 Next line.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so it proves me up for like maybe a minute and then I sort of get used to it.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I could get used to it too.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I could get used to it too.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, I just am very used to.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_04
 I see...

0:27:49	SPEAKER_04
 I have experienced this keyboard conflict, and with me the things that are confusing are where the control key is.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_04
 So I end up pressing shifts and control keys whenever I want the other one, whichever it is.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_04
 I can easily put a PC keyboard in there if anyone had...

0:28:03	SPEAKER_04
 We already have one.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_04
 I could add another one.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe let me know if you want it to have it shifted.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_04
 But, um...

0:28:12	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_04
 That's good.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, let me see.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_04
 So, um...

0:28:17	SPEAKER_04
 I wanted to maybe comment a little more on the interface in terms of what aspects of it are helpful in this.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_04
 And one thing that I've really been surprised by is how unique the shapes of some of these things are.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_04
 I know we had this interface for time when people were doing marking of the numbers.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_04
 And, um...

0:28:38	SPEAKER_04
 Forgotten, someone said that they could recognize a 7 when they saw it.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_04
 They could see the way of forming the 7.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_01
 I remember recognizing certain numbers.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_01
 I don't remember which ones.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_01
 I think it was maybe...

0:28:52	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I could recognize when there was a fricative at the beginning of a number.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_01
 For some reason it was like a little bit of energy or something, whatever you call it, and then it grew really big.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_01
 So like 4 and 5 and 3, I'll have the same characteristic.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_01
 And 6 and 7, I'll both have the same characteristics of the beginnings.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_01
 But 6 and 8...

0:29:12	SPEAKER_01
 8...

0:29:14	SPEAKER_01
 Um, I remember that people tended to not pronounce the last T.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_01
 And when they did it was slightly farther away from the rest of the word than you would have expected.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_01
 Same with 6.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the cast or the other.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_01
 That was really interesting to notice that.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_01
 It was a very different interface though.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_01
 It is different.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it would have had the benefit of...

0:29:43	SPEAKER_04
 So this was to handle the digits only, which is what you figure.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_04
 And did you... I thought you might have done that, Joy. Did you? So two people did that, I thought...

0:29:53	SPEAKER_04
 Did you do it?

0:29:54	SPEAKER_04
 I thought so good.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_02
 Just a little bit.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I only did a little bit.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_02
 What happened to that? You just stopped doing it?

0:29:59	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I think that we'll bring it back.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, okay.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_05
 This was a different interface entirely?

0:30:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_04
 Adam wrote this using the same computer language as Channel Trans is written in.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_04
 And what it would do is present you with the digit string that the person was supposed to have said.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_04
 And then you would listen to it.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_04
 And there were two parts of the task one of them was to see if that's what they actually said and to indicate, you know, transcribe errors of it.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_04
 And then the other aspect was to tighten the time bins.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_04
 And those data were actually used in some analyses, which showed very, very good results.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_04
 Good, wow.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_04
 And so it shows... I mean, it's useful.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_04
 This is why we do these digits.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_04
 It's a nice standard task.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_04
 And you have lots of different voices.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_04
 And it's very clear.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_04
 You know what the canonical answer is when a person says a number, at least most of the time, you know what number it was they said.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_04
 So it's ground truth as they call it, it's very clear.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_04
 But it was really rather minimal.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I like that interface very efficient.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_04
 And really, I think that we'll probably use it for getting the digits refined in terms of their time bins.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_01
 If I remember correctly, it seemed to be very efficient in the key strokes that you used to do certain things.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_01
 So I can't remember what they were now, but I just remember that it was once you learned them, it was very neat and concise and...

0:31:19	SPEAKER_01
 Excellent.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_02
 A couple of keys that you'd be finding them.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_02
 I would get the whole... I get the whole transfer meeting.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_00
 You had to find them.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_00
 You had to find them.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_02
 And they'd usually be at the end somewhere, but you had to figure out where the heck and the end to look for them.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_04
 I also think that it wasn't in this stage where some of these meetings had been transcribed.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think you could use a string search, right? I'm just trying to remember how that worked.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_04
 But it was difficult finding them for some reason.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it was also...

0:31:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the interface was different.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it was more complicated than any way than what it would be now.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_04
 Actually, you also did a different type of transcription with respect to our sister project, the SMARTCOM project, which involved listening to people who were supposed to be wandering through Germany.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_04
 And this is supposed to be something that would be useful and developing an interface to help them find their way.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_04
 So, someone else did that too.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_04
 I've forgotten who else did that.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_04
 Anybody else here do that?

0:32:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_01
 I feel like I did a little checking or something on that.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_04
 Actually, I think you might have done this also.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_01
 I don't remember actually transcribing it, but I remember listening to.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_04
 So, actually, we started with the words, and it was a matter then of trying to find the most efficient way to match the words up with the actual sounds.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_04
 Because they were reading from a script.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_04
 And then there was some conversation and addition that needed to be transcribed.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_04
 But, yeah.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_04
 One thing that you learn with this interface right away is that if you have really, really, really long utterances, it's extremely inefficient to do anything.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_04
 Because you end up, if you try to go up in the transcript, you end up with this huge, expensive time and things covering several screens and it's just horribly inefficient.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_01
 So, one thing that I still can't figure out with the interface.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_01
 It does this sometimes, but other times it doesn't.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_01
 And when you click on, you know, there's a bar above where this sound wave is that has a little bar of where the meeting is.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_01
 And it goes along as you're listening to the meeting and it ends up the end.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_01
 And if you click on that bar to the right of that little marker, then it moves forward if you click on the left and it moves back.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_01
 But sometimes it moves two frames or two screens.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yes.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_01
 Sometimes it doesn't.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_04
 I think that's totally dependent on how you have the resolution set so that it's a tiny thing.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_04
 And if I increase the resolution so it's spread out a bit more, then I seem to have more control over it.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't know.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_01
 I noticed that a few times it would do it, it would move twice.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_01
 That kind of makes sense.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_01
 And because, yeah, sometimes it wouldn't.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_01
 And maybe it maybe I had resolutions at different length.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_01
 Because yeah, if the resolution, if it's moving too slowly, then like if you were to click on some place, then it makes sense that it would get kind of confused.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_01
 But if it's moving quickly, it seems that it's covering more ground, faster.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_01
 So I don't know.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to report that to him because I know that's one of the reasons why when I suggested to visual scan the record that I suggested doing it by clicking on the right of that navigation bar you're mentioning.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_04
 Or actually clicking on the right of the sound wave and then letting it run past the boundary.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_01
 Because I had the same problem.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. That's what I tend to do is I use a sound wave.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_01
 But if I'm trying to scan through a long period of what appears to be silence.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_01
 It's a much more...

0:34:39	SPEAKER_01
 Try to scan it, but I can't because...

0:34:42	SPEAKER_04
 Because you end up missing entire frames.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_04
 So then I end up trying to make an arrow.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_01
 They have the arrow, the far right.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, okay.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_01
 So I use that sometimes.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_04
 So on that chart, on that bar you were described.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_01
 At the far right and far left, there's a little arrow that allows you to go like second by second or something.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_01
 Not second by second, but a little bit, bit by bit.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_04
 So is this the arrow on the right would be underneath that resolution bar?

0:35:03	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, it's like a little cluster up there.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_01
 It's not on the resolution part.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_01
 It's where you have...

0:35:09	SPEAKER_01
 It's where you have the marker of where you are in the meaning.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_01
 So you have this bar and you have a time marker that moves along.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_01
 Say you're halfway through the meaning.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_01
 It's going to be halfway along the line.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_04
 I have to do something visually.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_04
 So I would say you have the transcript screen.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_04
 And then you have a bar.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_04
 I think you're referring to this bar, aren't you?

0:35:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_04
 And then there's like this little resolution change.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_04
 And then you have the sound wave.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_04
 Exactly.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_04
 Something down here.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_04
 And then you got the different channels.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_01
 So right at the right and left of the...

0:35:40	SPEAKER_04
 So right in here, you have this bar that you move.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_04
 And as you go along, it...

0:35:43	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so...

0:35:45	SPEAKER_04
 You're saying that there's an arrow right here?

0:35:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_04
 And then there's an arrow right here.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:35:51	SPEAKER_05
 So we're talking there.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, that doesn't...

0:35:54	SPEAKER_05
 I usually use that.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_05
 I was just hanging about it.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_05
 If you use that.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_05
 I've never been able to use that because I feel like it's skipped such a huge...

0:36:00	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe we have resolution set totally different.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_01
 Orchans.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we do.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_01
 Jen and I have totally different resolutions because hers...

0:36:06	SPEAKER_01
 I tend to make it so fast.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_01
 We'll make it so fast.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it means it's more stretched.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_01
 I wouldn't use that much.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_01
 I was trying to get to a whole different part of it.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_01
 I usually have it set to where it has...

0:36:13	SPEAKER_01
 I don't use it too.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_01
 0.5 second intervals on the numbers.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that's interesting.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_04
 I haven't paid attention to the numbers.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_04
 I sort of like visually...

0:36:21	SPEAKER_04
 It helps me to have it be separated enough that I should find a new breaking point.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_04
 I find it even better.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's the reason I separated it out.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_01
 I do too.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_01
 But sometimes if it gets too...

0:36:30	SPEAKER_01
 For me to stretch it out, I'll tend to think that there's a break in between a pause inside of a word or something.

0:36:39	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yes.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_01
 Because the waveform becomes too stretched out.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, right.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_01
 Because it's meant to be a little bit...

0:36:44	SPEAKER_01
 It's meant to be a little bit...

0:36:45	SPEAKER_01
 I said, right.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_01
 I'll stretch it in a particular place.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_01
 Sort of like how it can be medium so you can make sure that the waveform has its shape.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_01
 No, I know you're talking about it.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_01
 It's kind of interesting.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we're coming kind of close to the end of our timing.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_04
 I did ask about dessert and they told me it was ice cream and it doesn't say well.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_04
 Well, there's any left.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_02
 It was too high again.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_02
 There were those tarts again.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_02
 I'd be like, set us some aside.

0:37:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, there's some.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_02
 That's a nice, really.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_04
 But I was thinking, you know, it is interesting to me to think about how each of us have sampled different meetings and get...

0:37:28	SPEAKER_04
 It's...

0:37:29	SPEAKER_04
 It's making to me to think that if I were to describe someone's characteristics in terms of their speech patterns, I bet you...

0:37:35	SPEAKER_04
 We would all agree on who it was.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_04
 I think that's so interesting.

0:37:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_04
 It's a statement of speaker style, of course.

0:37:42	SPEAKER_01
 And also that we can...

0:37:45	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know, that we have this shared realm of knowledge kind of and can laugh about things that other people would not understand whatsoever.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_01
 Or, you know, little intricacies and idiosyncrasies of people's...

0:37:59	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's really post-ism.

0:38:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, or even just about what we're talking about with the technical part in the interface.

0:38:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_04
 Do you have any favorite parts of these meetings?

0:38:09	SPEAKER_04
 Things that you...

0:38:10	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, we talked briefly about this last time.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_02
 When people get really loopy and start telling lots of jokes...

0:38:16	SPEAKER_02
 I enjoy always transcribing those sections.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_04
 Do you think this is usually toward the end of the meeting or does it vary?

0:38:24	SPEAKER_02
 It seems to be more at the end.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_06
 Or in the beginning, the very beginning.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, yeah.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_06
 It would be joking around.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's true.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_04
 Do you have a favorite group that you...

0:38:34	SPEAKER_04
 I don't want to cause any partisanship here, but...

0:38:37	SPEAKER_04
 Wait, a favorite one?

0:38:38	SPEAKER_04
 A favorite type of meeting that you like or...

0:38:43	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, you mean like...

0:38:45	SPEAKER_02
 Meeting recorder as opposed to EDU as opposed...

0:38:49	SPEAKER_02
 Like those groups?

0:38:50	SPEAKER_04
 Whichever, that way or a nature of a meeting or...

0:38:54	SPEAKER_01
 I prefer ones that are somewhat linguistically related.

0:38:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:58	SPEAKER_01
 It's more interesting.

0:38:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I like those.

0:39:00	SPEAKER_01
 I don't like the technical ones because I don't understand what they're talking about.

0:39:03	SPEAKER_01
 Exactly.

0:39:04	SPEAKER_01
 And so I'm just really hard.

0:39:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:39:06	SPEAKER_01
 And I'm sitting there bored because I really have no concept of what they're talking about.

0:39:09	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm going, okay.

0:39:10	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just going to listen to you.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:39:14	SPEAKER_05
 The ones that were they're talking about linguistic things that were great, I love those.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_04
 Would these be the EDU meetings?

0:39:20	SPEAKER_04
 That's what I think.

0:39:21	SPEAKER_01
 Is that true?

0:39:22	SPEAKER_01
 The ones that Liz and you...

0:39:24	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, really?

0:39:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:39:26	SPEAKER_01
 Let's do some...

0:39:27	SPEAKER_01
 And the meeting recorder ones, there's some talk of...

0:39:30	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:39:31	SPEAKER_01
 Discourse stuff.

0:39:32	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's really fun too to listen to when you give reports on transcription.

0:39:35	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I really had the questions.

0:39:37	SPEAKER_01
 I was like, you know, talking bad about the transcribers.

0:39:40	SPEAKER_01
 I was just making fun.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_01
 And stuff's really funny.

0:39:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:39:44	SPEAKER_01
 That's why I like John.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_02
 I like fun and transcriber.

0:39:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:39:48	SPEAKER_02
 That's why I like listening to him.

0:39:50	SPEAKER_01
 He's always making fun of transcribers.

0:39:52	SPEAKER_04
 It would be a kick in a good nature, I know.

0:39:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:39:56	SPEAKER_04
 It would be really fun to have a collage of all these things like, well, the transcribers...

0:39:59	SPEAKER_02
 So it was mararuru, and then it would be some horrible thing.

0:40:25	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's funny when there's little side conversations about that that happened at the

0:40:39	SPEAKER_01
 same time too. I think those are interesting.

0:40:41	SPEAKER_01
 And I think it's really cool when people start getting really excited about something or angry about something because then they tend to interrupt each other a lot and I don't know.

0:40:53	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I remember one where one person was really trying to get something out, really, really desperately, and he kept getting attracted by like three other people and he was like, I, I, I, I, I, I, and it was, I mean, it was kind of sad, but it was like also really interesting to watch.

0:41:11	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to listen to.

0:41:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:41:14	SPEAKER_04
 If you notice that sometimes you have these...

0:41:16	SPEAKER_04
 Greater Frequency of Speechairs, I think, during times of overlap, which is just...

0:41:20	SPEAKER_04
 You can just tell a person's monitoring at two levels and it's...

0:41:23	SPEAKER_01
 They're like just trying really hard to get it out before they get it untrusted or something and it just falls apart.

0:41:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:41:30	SPEAKER_01
 Ellie, transcribing you because you're very polite.

0:41:32	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, thank you.

0:41:33	SPEAKER_01
 Ellie, you're all like, well, I was just thinking about this.

0:41:39	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe this might be if, you know, it's just, it's just kind of cute because everybody's like, oh, well, okay.

0:41:45	SPEAKER_01
 And they're just listening to you.

0:41:46	SPEAKER_01
 They're just like, well, okay.

0:41:50	SPEAKER_01
 It's got a neat...

0:41:52	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:41:53	SPEAKER_04
 Let's see.

0:41:55	SPEAKER_04
 Have you noticed that one of the things that I found is surprisingly difficult these days is to get certain electronic sounds to try and describe them?

0:42:03	SPEAKER_04
 I've seen about that the other day is like, it's like, you know, someone in one of these meetings they have a laptop and they hit the thing and the, and there's an error screen that comes up and it has this kind of sound.

0:42:13	SPEAKER_04
 What was that?

0:42:16	SPEAKER_04
 It's not a beep.

0:42:17	SPEAKER_04
 It's not a bell.

0:42:18	SPEAKER_04
 It's not a bell.

0:42:19	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, you, all these words that I could imagine, it's like, it's a tiny kind of electronic sound that comes up when you make an error with your laptop.

0:42:26	SPEAKER_01
 That's not very, very helpful.

0:42:29	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just wondering how they're going to transcribe you saying that.

0:42:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:42:34	SPEAKER_04
 You mean the voice quality?

0:42:36	SPEAKER_04
 The shard.

0:42:37	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, no.

0:42:38	SPEAKER_06
 I'm trying to think things hard on ourselves.

0:42:45	SPEAKER_06
 I know.

0:42:46	SPEAKER_04
 And then, you know, there are these other things that I think are really interesting.

0:42:51	SPEAKER_04
 Like the vocal changes in character, people shifting into kind of a comic voice or sort of a mock this or mock that, you know, the sign and, oh, no.

0:43:01	SPEAKER_04
 You know, it's, it's, there are lots of nuances which we, which we use very often.

0:43:07	SPEAKER_04
 So, comic words and things like that.

0:43:10	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry.

0:43:11	SPEAKER_01
 I just remembered one thing that really was, you needed, I think it was you that pointed out the problem.

0:43:18	SPEAKER_01
 Like you needed to be at the meeting to be able to transcribe correctly the noise.

0:43:21	SPEAKER_01
 I think it was Adam was making this really strange noise.

0:43:24	SPEAKER_01
 And apparently he was pretending.

0:43:26	SPEAKER_01
 He was like pretending to screw something into his head.

0:43:30	SPEAKER_01
 Was that what it was?

0:43:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, yes.

0:43:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:43:33	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yes.

0:43:37	SPEAKER_04
 And he got to transcribe this meeting.

0:43:39	SPEAKER_04
 And the rest, all of us met up stuff about, because I was getting a report on what the comments were.

0:43:42	SPEAKER_04
 And it was one of these was this.

0:43:44	SPEAKER_04
 It was, what, he is what he said.

0:43:47	SPEAKER_01
 He was going like this at the time.

0:43:49	SPEAKER_01
 Just like, I am not amused.

0:43:51	SPEAKER_05
 I'm not like, try and repeat what he said because I don't want to put the transgrapher through it again.

0:43:56	SPEAKER_05
 I think he actually had a big list of things that people had transcribed and then they were reading one by one and being like, what's this?

0:44:04	SPEAKER_05
 This?

0:44:05	SPEAKER_05
 You know, this is the most beautiful sound.

0:44:07	SPEAKER_05
 This is the most beautiful sound.

0:44:08	SPEAKER_01
 I have one like that where they were describing the different qualities of uh-huh and uh-uh and uh-uh and like what EH is versus UH versus AH.

0:44:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that was really hard.

0:44:20	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I have one like that too.

0:44:22	SPEAKER_05
 I have one where they were just, they were just like talking about each word you know and they were saying they were just describing the word over and over again and just the quotes around the word were driving me crazy.

0:44:36	SPEAKER_05
 Knowing when to put the quotes and when and then they were talking about like the difference between uh-uh when it's A or when it's uh-uh.

0:44:43	SPEAKER_05
 At that time they were saying it so much I didn't know how to transcribe it anymore.

0:44:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I don't know if you're saying A or I anymore.

0:44:52	SPEAKER_04
 Oh.

0:44:53	SPEAKER_04
 He did an excellent job.

0:44:54	SPEAKER_04
 That was really, it was like, it's transcribed in a meta-transcribed in a meta-medicine.

0:44:58	SPEAKER_04
 It was fun.

0:45:00	SPEAKER_04
 You know, I'm really interested in this topic.

0:45:02	SPEAKER_04
 Would it be a problem if we continue to a little bit longer on this or do you need to do people need to leave?

0:45:06	SPEAKER_04
 I don't want to keep you longer than I have to get anywhere until five.

0:45:10	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, we won't be that long.

0:45:11	SPEAKER_04
 I'm really appreciate it.

0:45:13	SPEAKER_04
 This is just really, it's not interesting to me the specific experiences of having encountered these data in this way.

0:45:22	SPEAKER_04
 Does anything else want to say anything about?

0:45:26	SPEAKER_02
 I mean just weird things like before, like I had kind of a weird thing happen and we talked about it.

0:45:32	SPEAKER_02
 It was when I first started working on the project I got this discussion where this was before we had the different channels and um- Dan Ellis was one of Dan Ellis's little here so it was like kind of early on, right?

0:45:43	SPEAKER_02
 And um- he- everyone's talking and then all of a sudden you hear Dan talking to someone else and it's different people that you'd never heard before.

0:45:55	SPEAKER_02
 And what he had done is he had left the room.

0:45:58	SPEAKER_02
 He had bought the microphone with him and he was without the channelized interface.

0:46:03	SPEAKER_02
 So you have no idea.

0:46:05	SPEAKER_02
 You think everyone's just become schizophrenic or something, or like in their own world or something.

0:46:10	SPEAKER_02
 Then all of a sudden he's talking about a copy and he needs a copy machine.

0:46:13	SPEAKER_02
 I don't- I don't know.

0:46:14	SPEAKER_02
 And I'm just assuming he's still in the room and what the heck is he talking to?

0:46:17	SPEAKER_02
 And he was just weird things like that and um- yeah he had just left the room, got and made a copy and he still had his microphone on.

0:46:24	SPEAKER_02
 And I could hear the- the- the women behind the desk talking to him This is really bizarre.

0:46:30	SPEAKER_02
 So that's really funny.

0:46:32	SPEAKER_04
 Anyway, just weird things like that.

0:46:35	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it is- there's another case where I ran across like of that type when I was sitting here and we were doing- it's like one of the first meetings I ever participated in and Dan was adjusting something here and Adam was in the next room.

0:46:46	SPEAKER_04
 And um- Adam says, so I'll come in here and check the levels and- and he says something and Dan says no.

0:46:55	SPEAKER_04
 And it sounds like he's saying not to Adam.

0:46:58	SPEAKER_04
 So this would have been extremely rude. And the reason that it would be rude is because you don't have this information from hearing all these equalized volume channels.

0:47:08	SPEAKER_04
 You don't know that they're not participating in the same conversation at all.

0:47:13	SPEAKER_04
 It really is strange.

0:47:16	SPEAKER_04
 It is true that this is kind of artificial discourse aspect.

0:47:23	SPEAKER_04
 The mixed channel is artificial because we're boosting it in order to make everything audible.

0:47:27	SPEAKER_01
 It's interesting because like when I'm working late at night, I actually don't feel so lonely because there are so many voices in my head.

0:47:37	SPEAKER_04
 When you live here, when you're somewhere else.

0:47:39	SPEAKER_01
 When I'm working here, it's like 9 o'clock and nobody's here except for me.

0:47:43	SPEAKER_01
 And I'm like, you know, I don't feel so lonely because there are like eight people talking to me all at once.

0:47:50	SPEAKER_04
 Like wow.

0:47:52	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know about these meetings where there are like eight speakers in one meeting.

0:47:57	SPEAKER_04
 What are those like?

0:47:58	SPEAKER_04
 It takes a long time.

0:47:59	SPEAKER_02
 It takes a long time to do.

0:48:01	SPEAKER_02
 In a way they're more fun though.

0:48:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:48:03	SPEAKER_02
 It's just more variety.

0:48:04	SPEAKER_01
 I'm so nervous.

0:48:05	SPEAKER_01
 It tends to have still a dominant group of speakers.

0:48:08	SPEAKER_01
 And then there are two or three people generally who don't talk at all except to say they're digits or something or who- In the brain.

0:48:15	SPEAKER_01
 Or to breathe.

0:48:16	SPEAKER_01
 That's what it's like.

0:48:17	SPEAKER_01
 Lots of breathing.

0:48:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:48:19	SPEAKER_01
 But I think that still overall you're going to have probably three or four or five dominant speakers.

0:48:26	SPEAKER_01
 One thing I noticed is that like there was this one meeting I was transcribing.

0:48:30	SPEAKER_01
 There were nine speakers.

0:48:31	SPEAKER_01
 And by the end of it, I was so entirely sick of listening to the same conversation all over again.

0:48:37	SPEAKER_01
 Nine times.

0:48:38	SPEAKER_01
 Nine.

0:48:39	SPEAKER_01
 Nine.

0:48:40	SPEAKER_01
 I was in slow mode.

0:48:41	SPEAKER_01
 I was going nuts.

0:48:42	SPEAKER_01
 I was like, I cannot take this.

0:48:43	SPEAKER_01
 I cannot listen to this.

0:48:44	SPEAKER_01
 I have the same reaction.

0:48:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:48:49	SPEAKER_04
 Sometimes these are meetings I participated in.

0:48:50	SPEAKER_01
 This is like the test one.

0:48:52	SPEAKER_01
 Bad dream.

0:48:53	SPEAKER_01
 This is key.

0:48:55	SPEAKER_01
 This keeps happening to me.

0:48:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:48:57	SPEAKER_04
 And for changes.

0:48:58	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to check out.

0:48:59	SPEAKER_04
 It's sad to be sure that we're okay with the-

0:49:01	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. Did you guys ever- This happened to me when I first started transcribing because I'd never really transcribed.

0:49:06	SPEAKER_02
 So can we stay for another half hour in this room?

0:49:08	SPEAKER_02
 Good.

0:49:09	SPEAKER_02
 Thanks.

0:49:10	SPEAKER_02
 I would leave here and I would go out and do my daily business and I would hear people speaking to me.

0:49:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I would transcribe them in my- What are the types of- Yeah.

0:49:21	SPEAKER_02
 It went away.

0:49:22	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe after a couple of weeks.

0:49:24	SPEAKER_02
 I still do that.

0:49:25	SPEAKER_01
 I still do that.

0:49:26	SPEAKER_01
 Really, I'm like on the bus or something when I'm boring.

0:49:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:49:30	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't mean to be doing it.

0:49:33	SPEAKER_02
 It was just an intrusion.

0:49:36	SPEAKER_02
 It was just an intrusion.

0:49:37	SPEAKER_02
 Not a bad intrusion.

0:49:39	SPEAKER_02
 Not something I was sort of volitionally sort of.

0:49:42	SPEAKER_01
 I would also be really aware of how I was speaking.

0:49:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:49:47	SPEAKER_01
 Because I also tend to- Like we were talking about so, I do that.

0:49:50	SPEAKER_01
 I'll end utterances with so or- And- Yeah.

0:49:54	SPEAKER_01
 And it'll just be a trailing off and I'll think, man, I would be such a pain in the butt to transcribe.

0:49:58	SPEAKER_01
 I just- Yeah, I do the same thing as you do.

0:50:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:50:02	SPEAKER_01
 I'll listen to somebody and his and her speech will be particularly idiosyncratic and I'll go, wow, I just- I'm glad I'm not transcribing him or her.

0:50:10	SPEAKER_01
 I noticed a lot of my speech.

0:50:13	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know, I wouldn't call him errors.

0:50:15	SPEAKER_01
 I guess disvalancies.

0:50:16	SPEAKER_01
 A lot more once when I started transcribing.

0:50:19	SPEAKER_01
 Just notice people in general that people- Yeah.

0:50:23	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:50:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:50:25	SPEAKER_01
 Break up their speech interestingly.

0:50:26	SPEAKER_01
 And it may sometimes that we manage to communicate.

0:50:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:50:29	SPEAKER_01
 Actually.

0:50:30	SPEAKER_01
 Because people will say just like monosolabic little grunts and squeaks and things- I think that shows a lot of- You mean something?

0:50:40	SPEAKER_01
 I think that shows a lot of how it's not all acoustic.

0:50:42	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, there's other things involved eye contact body language, gesture, whatever.

0:50:46	SPEAKER_04
 That raises the question.

0:50:47	SPEAKER_04
 Do you think that you would have been considerably helped if we had had videotapes of these things?

0:50:54	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, sure.

0:50:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:50:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:50:57	SPEAKER_01
 I definitely think so.

0:50:58	SPEAKER_01
 And I think there would be a lot more interesting data to analyze later on.

0:51:01	SPEAKER_04
 Well, that's right.

0:51:03	SPEAKER_04
 Because you're involved in gesture research.

0:51:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, because then you know exactly what's going on, what the context cues are.

0:51:09	SPEAKER_01
 And you can really get a feel for the interpersonal relationships.

0:51:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:51:13	SPEAKER_01
 It kind of comes into play, maybe not for speech recognition, but for other things.

0:51:18	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe.

0:51:19	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe this is what it's like to be blind.

0:51:21	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, interesting.

0:51:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:51:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:51:24	SPEAKER_04
 No, no.

0:51:25	SPEAKER_01
 Visual input at all.

0:51:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you just have to rely on your intonation and other things like that.

0:51:33	SPEAKER_01
 And you get so much more aware of all of that.

0:51:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:51:37	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe.

0:51:38	SPEAKER_04
 I know someone who actually recognizes perfumes in the elevator.

0:51:41	SPEAKER_04
 There's a blind man in this building.

0:51:43	SPEAKER_04
 And Lila was in the elevator one day.

0:51:47	SPEAKER_04
 And they hadn't spoken yet because he just came on the elevator and he says, then she said something and he says, you've changed your perfume.

0:51:56	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, wow.

0:51:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, pretty interesting.

0:51:58	SPEAKER_04
 Did she change your perfume?

0:52:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, she had.

0:52:01	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, wow.

0:52:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:52:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:52:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:52:05	SPEAKER_01
 And so, interesting.

0:52:06	SPEAKER_01
 Enhanced other senses, I guess.

0:52:07	SPEAKER_01
 That's really cool.

0:52:08	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:52:09	SPEAKER_04
 Have you, I've learned several things about having been with the close talking mics.

0:52:14	SPEAKER_04
 This is a new experience because I've, of course, been involved in this kind of thing for quite a while.

0:52:18	SPEAKER_04
 But there are several things that didn't realize you could hear so reliably.

0:52:22	SPEAKER_04
 And some of these are other things like when the mouth opens and the in breath and stuff.

0:52:26	SPEAKER_04
 And how extremely audible.

0:52:28	SPEAKER_04
 And visual.

0:52:29	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, you can see these, the in breath and things.

0:52:31	SPEAKER_04
 That was really surprising to me that you, that's something you don't hear in normal speech too.

0:52:36	SPEAKER_01
 In normal conversations, unless it's very dramatic or very loud, that people click their lips are always making funny noises.

0:52:45	SPEAKER_06
 And you're not talking on the phone and the phone is, the levels are funny, then you hear it.

0:52:50	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:52:51	SPEAKER_04
 So it's kind of like that.

0:52:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:52:53	SPEAKER_04
 I guess it's also one of these things that you usually is not meaningful.

0:52:55	SPEAKER_04
 So we sort of screen it out.

0:52:57	SPEAKER_04
 All these different, because you know, I mean, we do that all the time with all other, lots of other aspects of the acoustics, so don't you?

0:53:03	SPEAKER_04
 It sounds like it's a nice smooth melody.

0:53:06	SPEAKER_04
 But these things are voicing and unvoicing or tripping in and out and they don't.

0:53:09	SPEAKER_04
 The contour is really not nearly that neat.

0:53:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:53:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, well, yeah, most of the time when we're listening to other people's speech, we're just trying to get the gist, not literally what people are saying.

0:53:19	SPEAKER_02
 And so, you know, all the uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, this is terms and all the stuff that we think is tuning it out.

0:53:23	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:53:24	SPEAKER_02
 And uh, it's that top down thing again.

0:53:26	SPEAKER_02
 Just, right?

0:53:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:53:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, absolutely.

0:53:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:53:30	SPEAKER_02
 What is the point of what this person is trying to communicate kind of?

0:53:33	SPEAKER_02
 Right?

0:53:34	SPEAKER_01
 So, which is a very, that's how I tended before studying linguistics anyways.

0:53:40	SPEAKER_01
 And it definitely before doing transcription, how I tended to look at all conversations and then coming here and doing this, you have to look at speech in a totally more intense way, including, I mean, every little aspect.

0:53:56	SPEAKER_01
 When I tell people what I do here and tell them, yeah, I'm transcribing, and they think I'm like a stenographer or something.

0:54:04	SPEAKER_01
 No, I don't correct the grammar.

0:54:06	SPEAKER_01
 I don't erase the umbs and uh, I record all the sides and the laughs and the breaths and there, I don't know.

0:54:12	SPEAKER_01
 It's a very different thing than most people can relate to, I guess.

0:54:17	SPEAKER_04
 But I agree.

0:54:18	SPEAKER_04
 Another thing that I think is interesting in these meetings is certain speakers have a tendency to embed utterances and other utterances.

0:54:25	SPEAKER_04
 And um, you know, it's very clear when you see it, when you hear it with the international markers, but well, just the contours.

0:54:33	SPEAKER_04
 But the words in the page is not at all clear.

0:54:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:54:37	SPEAKER_04
 And there are a couple people who do this in particular.

0:54:39	SPEAKER_04
 I would say that it's both, I would say that both Jerry and Morgan do this.

0:54:44	SPEAKER_04
 And it's amazing how fluent it is when you hear it, but how very complicated it is when you see the words.

0:54:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:54:54	SPEAKER_01
 And when you think about it, they pick up exactly where they left off.

0:54:58	SPEAKER_01
 Even though maybe it's several seconds later, there's no glitch in the syntax or anything.

0:55:03	SPEAKER_01
 We're pretty amazing.

0:55:05	SPEAKER_01
 Machines, creatures, whatever.

0:55:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:55:09	SPEAKER_01
 That's really cool.

0:55:10	SPEAKER_01
 Machines.

0:55:11	SPEAKER_04
 So, and then of course there are these things which I think are also nicely represented in the data, which are these funny sounds people make.

0:55:21	SPEAKER_04
 Which some greet us borrowing from comic talk.

0:55:24	SPEAKER_04
 So, I notice people going, you know, if they're trying to say something is done, the Germans do this, I think, in particular.

0:55:31	SPEAKER_04
 And there are others that we use like that, which are sort of semi-conventional lies, but you wouldn't think that you would write them down.

0:55:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the one I get all the time is, oh yes, because it's like, I don't know how, I just turn on the sky, but as I say, like click, and then I say it's like a vocal gesture.

0:55:48	SPEAKER_01
 Like a shrugger, some sort of like, well there it is, or that's it, or something like that.

0:55:54	SPEAKER_01
 You know, that people do that one a lot, and there was one speaker who used to do it constantly.

0:55:59	SPEAKER_01
 And after a while, I started getting confused as to whether or not he was like just going to himself, or whether he was meaning it in conversation.

0:56:12	SPEAKER_01
 Sometimes it was really obvious that he meant it as some sort of vocal cue, but then sometimes it was more ambiguous, like it was tough to tell, because he would just always be clicking.

0:56:23	SPEAKER_04
 Is this the one that, I mean, it could be the one we're thinking about.

0:56:26	SPEAKER_01
 It could be, but I noticed it more as it was obviously not, because it was always, and the one I'm thinking of always came in groups of four or something.

0:56:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, well, and so it wasn't ever like a single.

0:56:43	SPEAKER_01
 It would be as good as a lot of single ones.

0:56:46	SPEAKER_01
 How interesting.

0:56:48	SPEAKER_01
 And that's another thing, like I realize I do that too.

0:56:51	SPEAKER_04
 I'll ask you this is later, I don't want to, because I can't remember the name actually.

0:56:55	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:56:56	SPEAKER_04
 The one that I'm thinking of, it's a matter of you can tell us in context where he's looking in his agenda to see, you know, do I have time to do this and he's calculating in his mind?

0:57:04	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know, almost like a stand-in for a calculator kind of thing, but it's signaling.

0:57:08	SPEAKER_04
 I'm sure that everybody, I'm sure that other people can hear it, so it's sort of like, what am I and I'm thinking?

0:57:12	SPEAKER_04
 It's not like, it's not like, it's not a standard way.

0:57:16	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah, that's a different person.

0:57:18	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, I know how you're talking about it, but he must do this in a lot of meetings, because I think, you know, I've found a good message in a couple of times.

0:57:25	SPEAKER_02
 I've heard, yeah, which I just write as mouth. Oh, I see a mouth, because I think I had talked to you about this, about what, what do we do?

0:57:36	SPEAKER_02
 What was it that I, oh, I was lip smack.

0:57:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I was marking lip smack, and you said, yeah, that's, it's different noise, but it's what made me think of it.

0:57:49	SPEAKER_02
 And you said, don't do lip smack, just do, we don't need it, it's too specific, just do mouth for all those noises.

0:57:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, okay, what I would say, this is good to know this, what I would say is, if it's communicatives, beyond just the mouth opening and the, you know, the mechanical aspects that happen when you happen to be about to speak, then I would like to have it, if it's communicative, it'd like to have it preserved.

0:58:15	SPEAKER_04
 But if it's just this mechanical stuff mouth is fine. It seems like the computer science people use lip smack for that.

0:58:22	SPEAKER_04
 I personally, my choice, we're still deciding on how we're going to encode it in the final version, but I tend to not like lip smack because I think that that could be meaningful and still confusing.

0:58:33	SPEAKER_04
 People talk about, you know, all of a G, that was really good, and then they do, I'm not going to do it, because I don't really know how to do lip smack, but it seems like it would be a verbal gesture.

0:58:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I was thinking the one that you just did, makes me think of what people would write as Tisk Tisk.

0:58:48	SPEAKER_01
 So yeah, you know, I'm not sure, so they're trying to communicate displeasure.

0:58:53	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:58:54	SPEAKER_01
 And so that, yeah, at least two or three that I can think of that to me are very different.

0:59:01	SPEAKER_01
 You know, there's like, you know, that and there's like, you know, what the one I did before, there's like, I don't know, like, I would say time click for that.

0:59:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I would also probably put in parentheses that I thought it was a vocal gesture, because I think it's communicative of a certain thing.

0:59:18	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:59:19	None
 Yeah.

0:59:20	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know, I'm never sure whether or not to transcribe a difference with like, you know, and...

0:59:27	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, yeah, I'm not a point.

0:59:31	SPEAKER_01
 How do you transcribe?

0:59:32	SPEAKER_01
 I'll put like a good point.

0:59:33	SPEAKER_01
 I'll usually put an exclamation point.

0:59:36	SPEAKER_04
 I would too.

0:59:37	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's more infatic.

0:59:39	SPEAKER_04
 What about transcribing it?

0:59:41	SPEAKER_05
 Seignants are different.

0:59:42	SPEAKER_05
 H-M-P-H.

0:59:43	SPEAKER_05
 What about transcribing it that way?

0:59:45	SPEAKER_04
 Well, this is a good question.

0:59:47	SPEAKER_04
 I guess I would say, you know, sometimes we've seen in literature meaning, sorry.

0:59:55	SPEAKER_04
 It's a sound of indignation.

0:59:57	SPEAKER_04
 So if it's meant as a sound of indignation, then I think that would be how I would capture it with the H-M-P-H.

1:00:02	SPEAKER_01
 I usually tend to think that it's more of a...

1:00:06	SPEAKER_01
 Not indignation, something more positive.

1:00:08	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know exactly how to characterize it, but something more...

1:00:11	SPEAKER_04
 It's sort of like a sort of elevated...

1:00:14	SPEAKER_04
 It's like a sort of more surprise or...

1:00:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:00:18	SPEAKER_04
 Engagement?

1:00:19	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

1:00:20	SPEAKER_05
 I guess I could have two meanings sort of...

1:00:22	SPEAKER_02
 If it's a prize on the exclamation point, makes sense to you.

1:00:25	SPEAKER_04
 And then there's the other kind, which sounds similar, but it's really part of a laugh.

1:00:29	SPEAKER_04
 So...

1:00:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:00:31	SPEAKER_04
 Which is...

1:00:32	SPEAKER_04
 I would just say laugh for that.

1:00:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, once Adam was laughing and it was actually written out...

1:00:38	SPEAKER_02
 And I changed it.

1:00:40	SPEAKER_02
 I'm just like, it's just laughing.

1:00:42	SPEAKER_02
 Like someone had written like...

1:00:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, or...

1:00:46	SPEAKER_04
 I've had a crush that also.

1:00:49	SPEAKER_02
 And... right, change it to...

1:00:52	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's a tiger fish that's done something like they had written out of phonetic laugh.

1:00:55	SPEAKER_02
 And they didn't do it in any other place in the transcript.

1:00:58	SPEAKER_02
 I've had a crush that was a lot.

1:01:00	SPEAKER_04
 I've seen a lot of people laugh.

1:01:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's true.

1:01:03	SPEAKER_01
 And as far as problems with laughs is a lot of them were marked as breaths.

1:01:07	SPEAKER_01
 Because a lot of people...

1:01:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

1:01:10	SPEAKER_01
 I think we already talked about this last time.

1:01:12	SPEAKER_01
 But not so much as I never saw that right now, phonetically.

1:01:15	SPEAKER_02
 Well, here's a question.

1:01:17	SPEAKER_02
 And there's been some variance in transcripts that I've looked at when...

1:01:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

1:01:22	SPEAKER_02
 So when you laugh, you're exhaling all this air.

1:01:26	SPEAKER_02
 And so you need to inhale.

1:01:28	SPEAKER_02
 And so how do you transcribe the inhale?

1:01:30	SPEAKER_02
 Some people are transcribing it as a breath.

1:01:32	SPEAKER_02
 I used to, you know, back in the day, back when I was transcribing.

1:01:37	SPEAKER_02
 I would do the whole thing as a laugh.

1:01:39	SPEAKER_02
 That's amazing.

1:01:40	SPEAKER_02
 And to me, the breath is part of the laugh.

1:01:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, that's why I prefer.

1:01:43	SPEAKER_02
 So because in the ones I've been checking actually right now, that breath gets marked as a breath.

1:01:48	SPEAKER_02
 And I've been taking them out.

1:01:49	SPEAKER_02
 Because you would have a little bit of laugh.

1:01:50	SPEAKER_02
 Well done.

1:01:51	SPEAKER_01
 Well done.

1:01:52	SPEAKER_02
 Well done.

1:01:53	SPEAKER_02
 Well done.

1:01:54	SPEAKER_02
 Breath laugh.

1:01:55	SPEAKER_02
 It should be a laugh.

1:01:56	SPEAKER_02
 And then two dots, like the next bin will be empty.

1:01:57	SPEAKER_02
 And then it'll be breath.

1:01:58	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I think so.

1:01:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I see.

1:02:00	SPEAKER_02
 So it's like three sort of separate units as opposed to...

1:02:03	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's one sort of coherent thing.

1:02:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

1:02:06	SPEAKER_01
 So I put breath laugh in the brackets when I don't know whether it's a breath or a laugh.

1:02:09	SPEAKER_01
 It's good.

1:02:10	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, well, yeah.

1:02:11	SPEAKER_01
 That's a different.

1:02:12	SPEAKER_02
 Because sometimes it's not clear, like sometimes.

1:02:15	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

1:02:16	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

1:02:17	SPEAKER_02
 If other people are laughing, then I'll usually get a little bit of a different thing.

1:02:20	SPEAKER_04
 I'll get a little bit of a different thing.

1:02:21	SPEAKER_04
 And I think that's important because we're capturing the communicative level.

1:02:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, exactly.

1:02:25	SPEAKER_04
 And it's likely that it has a different contour than most breaths as well.

1:02:28	SPEAKER_04
 Because it's sort of expulsive and that kind of thing.

1:02:31	SPEAKER_04
 Exactly, exactly.

1:02:33	SPEAKER_04
 A lot of people go...

1:02:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, they do.

1:02:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, the stronger ones, sometimes we'll laugh it with the breath laugh.

1:02:38	SPEAKER_04
 And you can see it.

1:02:39	SPEAKER_04
 You can see the little...

1:02:40	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

1:02:41	SPEAKER_04
 That's interesting.

1:02:42	SPEAKER_04
 But yes, exactly.

1:02:43	SPEAKER_04
 I wouldn't talk.

1:02:44	SPEAKER_04
 That's a case where I know generally with the tigerfish things, if they put breath in, we leave it in.

1:02:49	SPEAKER_04
 But absolutely there.

1:02:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:02:51	SPEAKER_04
 Good laugh.

1:02:52	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

1:02:53	SPEAKER_04
 Change it.

1:02:54	SPEAKER_04
 And you know, there are other places where it's in the way.

1:02:55	SPEAKER_04
 I mainly said not to change their breaths simply because it would take time to move them.

1:02:58	SPEAKER_04
 And if they're not in the way, then don't talk too much.

1:03:00	SPEAKER_05
 A lot of times though, the breaths are results of bad segmentation.

1:03:04	SPEAKER_05
 And there's a segmentation of nothing.

1:03:06	SPEAKER_05
 And so they write it as a breath when it's clearly not a breath.

1:03:10	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

1:03:11	SPEAKER_05
 Now you always take those out.

1:03:12	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, usually it seems like the segment are often just sort of segments when there's really long spaces.

1:03:21	SPEAKER_05
 It's a segment's random spaces in between.

1:03:24	SPEAKER_05
 And you know, they get that and there's nothing there.

1:03:26	SPEAKER_05
 So they market as a breath when it's really actually nothing.

1:03:29	SPEAKER_05
 That's right.

1:03:30	SPEAKER_02
 So they take those out.

1:03:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

1:03:32	SPEAKER_02
 Well they give the segmenter the, because they don't have the rich interface that we do.

1:03:36	SPEAKER_02
 So they must be giving the pre-segmenter sort of the benefit of the doubt.

1:03:38	SPEAKER_02
 Well there must be something there.

1:03:39	SPEAKER_02
 Right, exactly.

1:03:40	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

1:03:41	SPEAKER_02
 Whether they're here or not.

1:03:42	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

1:03:43	SPEAKER_02
 Well it's a breath.

1:03:44	SPEAKER_01
 I wonder what they did put a missing segment.

1:03:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, there are somewhere.

1:03:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, somewhere.

1:03:48	SPEAKER_01
 Oh really?

1:03:49	SPEAKER_04
 Oh I always get the breath.

1:03:50	SPEAKER_04
 Well see, I do have previous filtering before I give the tiger fish ones out.

1:03:55	SPEAKER_04
 And I have tried to get that particular missing segment removed.

1:04:00	SPEAKER_04
 But I don't always.

1:04:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

1:04:02	SPEAKER_01
 I've seen a few of them.

1:04:03	SPEAKER_02
 So you've seen a few ways to allow you a misattribution to a voice.

1:04:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

1:04:07	SPEAKER_02
 And you'll hear part of what another person is saying.

1:04:11	SPEAKER_02
 And that's all transcribed on that one level.

1:04:13	SPEAKER_02
 But then you'll hear a little bit of it and then missing segment.

1:04:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

1:04:16	SPEAKER_02
 It's like okay, well it's in the wrong.

1:04:17	SPEAKER_02
 That person is not talking at all.

1:04:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

1:04:20	SPEAKER_02
 So just get rid of it.

1:04:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:04:22	SPEAKER_04
 Interesting.

1:04:24	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, well let's see.

1:04:26	SPEAKER_04
 So do you think that this has changed your speech in other ways in terms of myself?

1:04:32	SPEAKER_04
 I do feel that I'm, when I spend a lot of hours doing this, I've become less fluent.

1:04:36	SPEAKER_04
 Really?

1:04:37	SPEAKER_04
 More false starts and things.

1:04:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:04:39	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know if it could just be because you're so many more hours, I haven't been talking.

1:04:43	SPEAKER_01
 I guess I tried to be more careful in my speech more often.

1:04:48	SPEAKER_01
 Good.

1:04:49	SPEAKER_01
 Unless I'm really not paying any attention, like if I'm at a party or something and I'm just sort of having a good time then, doesn't really matter.

1:04:56	SPEAKER_01
 And you know, normal one-on-one speech.

1:05:00	SPEAKER_01
 I think I tend to try to enunciate more.

1:05:03	SPEAKER_01
 Because I've been told I mumbled.

1:05:06	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

1:05:09	SPEAKER_01
 And I guess I used to be worse about it.

1:05:11	SPEAKER_01
 I was told by my parents that I used to mumble a lot.

1:05:15	SPEAKER_01
 And also, I have this sort of East Coast accent that comes in sometimes that makes it hard for people on the West Coast to understand what I'm saying.

1:05:25	SPEAKER_01
 A lot of times, like if I'm not paying attention, I'll say something that will not really be heard.

1:05:33	SPEAKER_01
 I tend to leave off final consonants, for instance.

1:05:36	SPEAKER_01
 And people, I have to be conscious of that sometimes.

1:05:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

1:05:41	SPEAKER_04
 So many of the clarity sounds like, yeah, phrasing or strange things.

1:05:47	SPEAKER_01
 I think that I noticed, I don't know if it's really a question of me being more changing my speech necessarily, but I'm much more aware of interruptions and conversation.

1:05:58	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

1:05:59	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah, that's true.

1:06:00	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe I am more careful in the sense that I maybe don't interrupt as much, or I'm more aware of it when I am doing it or something like that.

1:06:09	SPEAKER_01
 But I just pay attention more to the fact that every pretty much all the time in normal conversation there are interruptions.

1:06:20	SPEAKER_01
 Unless you have really, I mean, I think if there were no interruptions, it would sound really awkward.

1:06:25	SPEAKER_01
 There would be a lot of pauses, and I would kind of imply uncomfortability or something.

1:06:31	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

1:06:32	SPEAKER_04
 I guess it depends partly on the type of interruption.

1:06:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:06:36	SPEAKER_04
 When you're just clarifying type, like, well, do you mean when they're partway through it in our utterance?

1:06:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:06:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:06:42	SPEAKER_01
 I tend to think of a conversation that has no interruptions as being something that's unnatural and forced or something like a meeting where, you know, I mean, everybody says they're a little spiel, and people are meant to be, you know, pretty quiet and attentive for the most part, and then let them finish, and then somebody else comes in and says something about it.

1:07:07	SPEAKER_01
 And then, like, a friendly conversation, I noticed that that's not really true, like what you were saying.

1:07:15	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

1:07:16	SPEAKER_01
 But even in cases like that, even when it is, say, now I'm contradicting myself, but even when it is very turn taking is very, like, people follow the turn taking rules or whatever, and don't really blatantly interrupt people.

1:07:32	SPEAKER_01
 And I remember this actually from a meeting because Liz was complaining there wasn't enough interruptions or not enough overlaps or something.

1:07:40	SPEAKER_01
 It wasn't interruptions, it's an overlap, something about that.

1:07:42	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's not an overlap.

1:07:43	SPEAKER_01
 And so she wanted there to be an argument or something so that there would be more.

1:07:46	SPEAKER_01
 And what she didn't realize was that throughout the meeting up until then, there had been, they were just very small, but they were there.

1:07:53	SPEAKER_01
 I think they're there pretty much all the time.

1:07:56	SPEAKER_04
 I agree.

1:07:57	SPEAKER_04
 I did do one analysis, more like one meeting.

1:07:59	SPEAKER_04
 Because the climate been, actually one of the people on the meeting had made the claim in the previous meeting that, well, there probably the overlaps only occurred during setup and at the end when we're leaving.

1:08:12	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah, that's totally not true.

1:08:14	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly, exactly.

1:08:15	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I think that that's sort of the feeling you would get if it was you looked at the data at this level.

1:08:20	SPEAKER_04
 And so the data analysis, in fact, it was really pretty constant rate all the way through the entire meeting and everyone was involved.

1:08:26	SPEAKER_04
 It wasn't just one or two speakers.

1:08:29	SPEAKER_01
 Everyone was kind of makes sense because if you want to speak next, it's almost like you got to get your foot in the door.

1:08:36	SPEAKER_01
 You got to be the one who, you know, make sure people recognize that you're the one who's going to speak next.

1:08:42	SPEAKER_04
 That's true.

1:08:43	SPEAKER_04
 I should say I didn't distinguish between overlaps and interruptions.

1:08:46	SPEAKER_04
 So some of these were back channels.

1:08:48	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, it's still the case.

1:08:50	SPEAKER_05
 I think silences are generally not good in conversation, too, because once you get a sil...

1:08:58	SPEAKER_05
 You know, it's to your benefit to try to get in right when you think they're done because if there's a silence, not only is it awkward, but then that sort of cues everybody to start thinking of a new topic to stop the silences.

1:09:11	SPEAKER_05
 And then you don't get to talk about what you wanted to talk about because the whole subject has changed.

1:09:16	SPEAKER_01
 You know what? Thinking about it, I think I've only noticed a couple times where there's been actual silence on all channels for a period of time.

1:09:26	SPEAKER_01
 It's true.

1:09:27	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

1:09:28	SPEAKER_04
 I agree.

1:09:29	SPEAKER_04
 Interesting observation.

1:09:30	SPEAKER_04
 Well, this has raised a couple of things for me that I wanted to mention because, you know, at this point, we're at the really fine, grain level of standardization, which I hadn't really thought of specifying in advance before.

1:09:46	SPEAKER_04
 I wanted to maybe just mention a couple of things.

1:09:48	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think that these are very common.

1:09:51	SPEAKER_04
 But what the idea that what we're trying to do is encode the communicative stuff when we have these gray areas.

1:10:00	SPEAKER_04
 I wanted to draw attention to the fact that there are sometimes these stretches where a person is trying to say something and formulating their thought, and they're coming out with a bunch of segments, which really aren't part of a word.

1:10:10	SPEAKER_04
 If you run across that word, there's some...

1:10:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:10:13	SPEAKER_04
 There's a word for it.

1:10:15	SPEAKER_04
 My feeling on that is that this isn't really a phonological transcript.

1:10:21	SPEAKER_04
 And potentially those things could probably be rendered, although some of them are not even full segments.

1:10:26	SPEAKER_04
 They're even sub-segmental, I would say.

1:10:28	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, you've got a single flap of a vocal cord sometimes.

1:10:31	SPEAKER_04
 And the apparatus is almost...

1:10:36	SPEAKER_04
 Almost going to say that it has somehow this vibration hit before the rest of it.

1:10:41	SPEAKER_04
 And that's not communicative.

1:10:43	SPEAKER_04
 So the way I do those things when I hear those is to...

1:10:48	SPEAKER_04
 I use in parentheses 1x, so it's marked.

1:10:52	SPEAKER_04
 Or if it's...

1:10:53	SPEAKER_04
 Or rural, but if it's six or seven or whatever it is, what are we putting those in?

1:10:58	SPEAKER_04
 And then what I do is I put in brackets...

1:11:02	SPEAKER_04
 Uncodable, sorry, un-codable, vocal sounds.

1:11:06	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, okay.

1:11:08	SPEAKER_04
 And of course, potentially they're codable.

1:11:10	SPEAKER_04
 But I just wanted to mark roughly how long it is, then indicate what the nature is.

1:11:17	SPEAKER_04
 So no one's going to try and go back and decode it as something that's a word that was not...

1:11:22	SPEAKER_04
 It has a different status than synthesized parts when they are words involved.

1:11:29	SPEAKER_04
 Just to set it aside, have some sort of a length indication.

1:11:32	SPEAKER_04
 And sometimes I'll be put them in a separate bin, although that's not necessary.

1:11:37	SPEAKER_04
 It's just sometimes it works out that way that they do this thing.

1:11:40	SPEAKER_04
 I should do that so often, I'm sorry about that.

1:11:43	SPEAKER_04
 They do this sound, and then there's a pause, and then they start speaking.

1:11:47	SPEAKER_04
 So then it's really obvious.

1:11:48	SPEAKER_04
 I can split it apart and it won't be any problem.

1:11:51	SPEAKER_01
 I'm glad you meant brought that up because I actually...

1:11:54	SPEAKER_01
 I'm one of the culprits that puts in all the little...

1:11:57	SPEAKER_01
 It's ebitty tiny sounds in the middle of everything.

1:11:59	SPEAKER_01
 I do that too, because I was thinking like you're just supposed to write down everything you hear as closely as possible.

1:12:06	SPEAKER_01
 And so I'm glad you said that because that actually takes a good amount of time and pretty strict concentration to do that.

1:12:14	SPEAKER_05
 I put in the exes.

1:12:16	SPEAKER_05
 I put in if it's an intelligible output.

1:12:18	SPEAKER_05
 I can't have any syllables, and then I put in six notes.

1:12:21	SPEAKER_01
 I do that if it's unintelligible, but if I can tell something, if somebody goes, I'll put an R.

1:12:27	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I see.

1:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 I see.

1:12:29	SPEAKER_01
 So if they go...

1:12:31	SPEAKER_01
 I'll go R-E-H-M-M-M.

1:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 So I've been doing that because that's what I can hear.

1:12:39	SPEAKER_01
 And I'm pretty damn sure that...

1:12:41	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

1:12:42	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

1:12:44	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

1:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

1:12:48	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

1:12:50	None
 Sorry.

1:12:52	None
 Sorry.

1:12:54	None
 Sorry.

1:12:56	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry.

1:13:00	SPEAKER_02
 You said the F1.

1:13:03	SPEAKER_01
 I'm doing a second cut.

1:13:07	SPEAKER_01
 You were what you were going to say.

1:13:10	SPEAKER_02
 She's pretty darn sure.

1:13:14	SPEAKER_02
 She's been making out probably.

1:13:16	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

1:13:17	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry.

1:13:20	SPEAKER_02
 I never sworn in any of the meetings.

1:13:22	SPEAKER_04
 If you heard shoot, I've heard a couple of times.

1:13:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:13:26	SPEAKER_02
 That's the swear word verse.

1:13:27	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no.

1:13:28	SPEAKER_02
 They just shoot.

1:13:29	SPEAKER_04
 I've heard the swear word verse in.

1:13:30	SPEAKER_01
 Remember that?

1:13:31	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:13:33	SPEAKER_01
 Back.

1:13:34	SPEAKER_01
 It was a long time.

1:13:35	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't remember that.

1:13:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

1:13:37	SPEAKER_01
 And I was like, aw.

1:13:38	SPEAKER_01
 I emailed you.

1:13:39	SPEAKER_01
 I was like, you might want to take this out.

1:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

1:13:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I do.

1:13:42	SPEAKER_01
 But it was very quiet.

1:13:43	SPEAKER_01
 It would have been sort of gone over by accident.

1:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 It was just very quiet, like, kind of under the breath.

1:13:48	SPEAKER_01
 I have faith.

1:13:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's why I was missed.

1:13:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I understand.

1:13:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:13:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:13:53	SPEAKER_04
 But you have to finish your point.

1:13:54	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, my goodness.

1:13:55	SPEAKER_01
 I was just saying that I'm pretty sure that I can tell what exactly what sounds are being produced.

1:14:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

1:14:04	SPEAKER_01
 So if it's right or I write an R, if it's right, tell it.

1:14:07	SPEAKER_05
 Then I always think that it's closer to stick with the X's because it's like how effective.

1:14:12	SPEAKER_05
 How effective is the Roman alphabet at deciphering all the sounds that a human can make?

1:14:18	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

1:14:19	SPEAKER_05
 It's not the IPA.

1:14:21	SPEAKER_05
 I just sort of think it's best to leave it with X's because I, English orthography conventions are just so uncertain anyway in the first place.

1:14:35	SPEAKER_05
 I usually only use them when I know that the person was trying to make a word.

1:14:40	SPEAKER_05
 I know that the word they were trying to say and that they were stuttering that.

1:14:43	SPEAKER_05
 Then I feel fine just writing out the letters.

1:14:46	SPEAKER_05
 But otherwise, I sort of don't feel right trying to write them out because I feel like it's...

1:14:51	SPEAKER_05
 You can't really...

1:14:53	SPEAKER_05
 It's not useful.

1:14:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, you can't really spell those things with the Roman alphabet.

1:14:57	SPEAKER_05
 It would say it was only set up for a different purpose, not necessarily so fun to launch it.

1:15:03	SPEAKER_04
 I agree.

1:15:04	SPEAKER_04
 I think there's another problem too.

1:15:05	SPEAKER_04
 And that is that we do have some short words which are communicative.

1:15:07	SPEAKER_04
 And sometimes, so if you have an ER as part of one of these fragments, we do have a lexicalized ER which is a filler item.

1:15:18	SPEAKER_03
 It does have a meaning.

1:15:19	SPEAKER_04
 So I think for both of those reasons, it's good to just leave it in this category of not really communicating in a word-like way.

1:15:26	SPEAKER_01
 So even if it's ER or...

1:15:28	SPEAKER_01
 I would keep ER.

1:15:29	SPEAKER_04
 Well, ER, you're not if it's filler.

1:15:31	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, ER, that stays.

1:15:33	SPEAKER_05
 But if it's part of these little fragments...

1:15:37	SPEAKER_05
 I have been transcribed that as OR.

1:15:39	SPEAKER_05
 I always thought that was OR sort of with a strange pronunciation.

1:15:41	SPEAKER_04
 I'm making a distinction.

1:15:42	SPEAKER_04
 So you have the comic ER where the person says something and then they pretend that they didn't want to say that, and they throw it in ER.

1:15:50	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, I don't get that one.

1:15:51	SPEAKER_04
 And that would be an ER, ER.

1:15:53	SPEAKER_04
 But if they're saying OR in a reduced way, so it comes out as OR, do it as OR.

1:15:59	SPEAKER_04
 Because that falls within the realm of pronunciation variants.

1:16:03	SPEAKER_04
 It's just like different ways of saying AND.

1:16:05	SPEAKER_04
 And I have two more things I wanted to say.

1:16:07	SPEAKER_04
 One of them is...

1:16:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, this is an interesting category to me.

1:16:11	SPEAKER_04
 And I don't...

1:16:13	SPEAKER_04
 You don't have to mark this systematically.

1:16:16	SPEAKER_04
 But when you're going through the meeting, and what I'd like people to do if you're not...

1:16:21	SPEAKER_04
 is to go through the meeting...

1:16:25	SPEAKER_04
 So if you're doing separate channels first, and then as a final pass through the mix channel, I don't think I've made that explicit, but it's really helpful to go through it a final time through the mix channel so that you hear things in context.

1:16:37	SPEAKER_04
 At that point, what I sometimes pick up is this metal level where someone finishes someone else's utterance.

1:16:42	SPEAKER_04
 So you'll suddenly have this stranded word out in the middle of nowhere.

1:16:45	SPEAKER_04
 And it's because this other speaker on this other channel was trying to formulate this thought and they paused.

1:16:51	SPEAKER_04
 And they paused, and they paused just enough that this person leaped in and gave them a word.

1:16:55	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

1:16:56	SPEAKER_04
 And I think those are interesting.

1:16:57	SPEAKER_04
 So when I find that, I noted it as finishing...

1:17:01	SPEAKER_04
 Put capital letters, capital letter, capital letter colon, post-fias utterance.

1:17:06	SPEAKER_02
 Wait, wait, how do you mark it?

1:17:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:17:09	SPEAKER_04
 So in the instance in which...

1:17:12	SPEAKER_04
 Let's say that Morgan's talking.

1:17:16	SPEAKER_04
 So he's talking.

1:17:19	SPEAKER_04
 And then somewhere, there's a bit of a pause, and let's say Adam fills in a word for him.

1:17:25	SPEAKER_04
 Then what I do is on Adam's channel, I say...

1:17:31	SPEAKER_04
 I say completing...

1:17:37	SPEAKER_04
 This isn't that common of an occurrence, completing speaker initial with a colon, post-fias utterance.

1:17:44	SPEAKER_04
 And what that means is at the time when we see we're going to go to a stage of anonymization.

1:17:48	SPEAKER_04
 So it's important to have the colon here because that'll make it possible to easily know who it was without having to do the math involved and figuring out which channel it was.

1:17:57	SPEAKER_04
 The problem with...

1:17:58	SPEAKER_04
 I originally wanted to use channel numbers as the reference index, but that's not functional because we have these two different numbering schemes.

1:18:06	SPEAKER_04
 You have the numbering and the channel trends interfaced. You have the numbering and the key file.

1:18:10	SPEAKER_04
 And this can be very different.

1:18:11	SPEAKER_04
 So you know to be able to...

1:18:13	SPEAKER_04
 This is redundant in a useful way and that you know that you're not going to make a mistake. I tried to do it with the numbers and I was making all sorts of inconsistent promises.

1:18:20	SPEAKER_01
 So that's probably why you added in that thing that automatically puts in the people's initials.

1:18:27	SPEAKER_04
 I did that partly to keep track of things.

1:18:30	SPEAKER_04
 Absolutely.

1:18:31	SPEAKER_04
 Absolutely.

1:18:32	SPEAKER_01
 So it's the fact that it was easier to deal with when there are initials.

1:18:36	SPEAKER_01
 The initials I wanted to hear that.

1:18:38	SPEAKER_04
 I didn't do that systematically until really rather recently, so I'm glad you know that it's useful.

1:18:43	SPEAKER_04
 It takes an extra step.

1:18:44	SPEAKER_04
 Glad it's useful.

1:18:45	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, and I just have one more thing to say and that is that once this is just such a...

1:18:50	SPEAKER_04
 I'm getting down to like the really easy, wincey stuff.

1:18:53	SPEAKER_04
 But once I found a comment that in curly brackets about mumbling and that's...

1:19:02	SPEAKER_04
 This is just to mention an instance that happened once is really grasping for details.

1:19:09	SPEAKER_04
 I think and it may be that it was not from anybody here.

1:19:14	SPEAKER_04
 But I think that mumble is only useful to me in the sense of whispered if it's like a manner of speaking in which case it's a call, but not in terms of replacing like this string of undesirable fragments.

1:19:27	SPEAKER_04
 This was used in place of something that was unintelligible in which case to be better to use parentheses and either explanation or the number of syllables if you know...

1:19:40	SPEAKER_02
 If you know the call with the word or something.

1:19:43	SPEAKER_04
 Exactly.

1:19:44	SPEAKER_04
 If it's a manner of speaking, then it's useful.

1:19:46	SPEAKER_04
 And otherwise the parentheses with an estimate of syllables is better.

1:19:51	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

1:19:52	SPEAKER_04
 So I guess you know I don't want to keep you. I really appreciate this.

1:19:57	None
 Yes.

1:19:57	SPEAKER_01
 So we are for...

1:19:59	SPEAKER_01
 Qual is used for things like whispered or said while laughing or...

1:20:08	None
 Yes.

1:20:08	SPEAKER_01
...with that nature.

1:20:09	SPEAKER_01
 I remember at some point we were doing the difference between vocal and non-vocal sense.

1:20:14	None
 Yes.

1:20:14	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, but good question.

1:20:15	SPEAKER_04
 And you don't have to add any of those tags.

1:20:17	SPEAKER_04
 Oh.

1:20:18	SPEAKER_04
 The only tags that you need to add is that there's like one exception that's just microscopic.

1:20:22	SPEAKER_04
 And that is sometimes...

1:20:24	SPEAKER_04
 This is again really rare.

1:20:26	SPEAKER_04
 Sometimes I've run across the word noise.

1:20:28	SPEAKER_04
 And offhand I don't know if that's a vocal noise or a non-vocal noise.

1:20:32	SPEAKER_04
 And so then I listen to it and I figured out.

1:20:34	SPEAKER_04
 But that's the only place you need to use a vocal non-vocal tag where it's potentially ambiguous between these two categories.

1:20:39	SPEAKER_04
 Because otherwise what I do when I get these is...

1:20:41	SPEAKER_04
 Of course I do my checks.

1:20:42	SPEAKER_04
 And then I have a script that I wrote which will separate everything out that has curly braces.

1:20:47	SPEAKER_04
 Do a listing of them.

1:20:49	SPEAKER_04
 And then anything...

1:20:51	SPEAKER_04
 Some of them already have tags from some previous modification.

1:20:56	SPEAKER_04
 But anything that doesn't, I just go through this list.

1:20:59	SPEAKER_04
 And I tag it right then.

1:21:01	SPEAKER_04
 And so in one change I can modify, you know, 500 instances of this.

1:21:09	SPEAKER_04
 So there's no need to add the vocal or the non-vocal.

1:21:12	SPEAKER_01
 But for noise that we know is something like mic noise or something like a noise.

1:21:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

1:21:21	SPEAKER_04
 Whatever the wink and mark it as that.

1:21:23	SPEAKER_04
 If you mark it mic noise then I'll know what kind of noise it is when I go through the thing and put the BORC or N on the NTH substitution file.

1:21:29	SPEAKER_04
 But it's very efficient for me to add those tags later.

1:21:31	SPEAKER_04
 It's really not.

1:21:32	SPEAKER_04
 Same thing with the call.

1:21:33	SPEAKER_04
 Just so long as I can tell which of those three categories it is or prawn.

1:21:37	SPEAKER_04
 But you know that's really very obvious the pronunciation of.

1:21:41	SPEAKER_04
 Just so long as it's clear to me from the comment which of those three it is that I'm following.

1:21:52	SPEAKER_04
 That's great.

1:21:53	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

1:21:54	SPEAKER_04
 So I guess...

1:21:55	SPEAKER_04
 Do you want to read digits?

1:21:56	SPEAKER_04
 Do I have time?

1:21:57	SPEAKER_04
 Do we have time?

1:21:58	SPEAKER_04
 Would you mind coming to digits?

1:21:59	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:22:00	SPEAKER_04
 So do you want to do it in unison this time?

1:22:03	SPEAKER_04
 Well we did it in unison last time.

1:22:04	SPEAKER_02
 I did.

1:22:05	SPEAKER_02
 I did.

1:22:06	SPEAKER_02
 I did.

1:22:07	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

1:22:08	SPEAKER_02
 Good deal.

1:22:09	SPEAKER_02
 Oh and do you want us to mark roughly the time we start?

1:22:12	SPEAKER_04
 That is really what that time field is.

1:22:14	SPEAKER_04
 I used to think it was the beginning of the meeting but yes.

1:22:16	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

1:22:17	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

1:22:18	SPEAKER_01
 The beginning of the meeting.

1:22:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:22:20	None
 Okay.

1:22:21	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

1:22:22	SPEAKER_04
 So who wants to start?

1:22:24	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I guess I'll start.

1:22:27	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

1:22:28	SPEAKER_04
 Trans...

1:22:29	SPEAKER_04
 And the time is.

1:22:30	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

 Okay.

1:23:07	SPEAKER_04
 I wanted to make one comment.

1:23:08	SPEAKER_04
 That is some of these are like two digits.

1:23:09	SPEAKER_04
 And just be sure you say both digits separately.

1:23:11	SPEAKER_04
 So 1.8 is to the 18.

1:23:12	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

1:23:13	SPEAKER_04
 I can go.

1:23:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

1:23:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.
