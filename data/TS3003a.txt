0:00:00	SPEAKER_00
 Good morning.

0:00:15	SPEAKER_00
 Good morning.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_00
 I see you all find your places.

0:00:19	SPEAKER_00
 Everybody sitting on the right place.

0:00:23	SPEAKER_00
 I guess so.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_00
 First I'll introduce myself.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if everybody knows me.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_00
 I'm Bart.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_00
 Hello.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_00
 Hello.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_00
 Bart.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_00
 Hello.

0:00:45	SPEAKER_00
 Hey, Bart.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_00
 Welcome.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_00
 Let's start off with a little presentation.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_00
 First I'll tell you a little bit about the setting.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_00
 You can see a few cameras here.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_00
 They'll record our actions.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_00
 And you'll have wires and microphones.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_00
 They will record your voice.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_00
 There are also some microphones there.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_00
 But you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those because it will disappear when you don't intend to do it.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_00
 So this is our project documents folder.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_00
 There are some notes in it already.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_00
 I see some documents.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_00
 I'll start with the presentation kick off.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_00
 I'm being modified by the administrator.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_00
 Let's do it redonely.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I don't know if you've noticed, but we're working for real reaction.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_00
 It's a company in electronics.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_00
 We put fashion in electronics.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_00
 We make it work.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_00
 We put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_00
 We put it in the project manager.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_00
 So I'll direct you through the project.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_00
 This is our agenda.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_00
 We have our opening of Queensland's tool training project plan discussion closing.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe I can sit down.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_00
 Then I can take some notes.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if it's not a lot of work.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_00
 If you hear something, you can write it down.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_00
 You can see it's the opening of Queensland's tools.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_00
 Queensland's is the point we've done a bit.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_00
 Have you all seen the corporate website already?

0:03:04	SPEAKER_00
 Have you seen any flaws in it?

0:03:07	SPEAKER_00
 I think I found one.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_01
 I paid much attention to it.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_00
 I see if it works.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_00
 No problem.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_00
 On the corporate information side, there was real remote instead of real reaction.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_00
 Real remote is not really the company we are, but it's just a little.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_00
 What are we going to do?

0:03:43	SPEAKER_00
 Our project aim is, as you can see, a new remote control.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_00
 It has to be original, trendy, and user-friendly.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_00
 So these are the points we also hired you.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_00
 We've got the marketing expert for the trendy and user-friendly look.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_00
 And in this real designer, there's also user-friendly and a bit original.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_00
 And we've got our user interface designer.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_00
 That's about the new remote control.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_00
 Our project method is, there are three phases we're going through.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_00
 The first is functional design, individual work meetings.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_00
 After the functional design, then the conceptual design and the detailed design, I had some role indications on here.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_00
 But I think you know it already by yourself.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_00
 The industrial designer is going to work on the working design, the components design, and a bit of the look and feel design.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_00
 The user interface designer is going to do the technical function design, user interface concept, and user interface design.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_00
 And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirements, specification, trend watching, and product evaluation.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_00
 So that's a bit what you're going to do.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_00
 That will be all worked out in other meetings.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_00
 Then we've got our first tool training.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_00
 So it's handy if we have a little bit of training first.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_00
 As you can see, we've got the smart boards here and here, and the white boards.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_00
 In the whiteboard here, there's a little toolbar on this side.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_00
 Here are some functions.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_00
 You can save these functions.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_00
 We don't have anything to do with.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_00
 Only undo.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_00
 You can undo a little piece of drawing, a blank new document for each person, select a pen, razor, capture redone, they have to do anything with.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_00
 Then we've got our pen, this pen.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_00
 It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_00
 In the thing, it is formal.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_00
 You can also select the current color and the line width.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_00
 With that first, you have to select the pen function.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_00
 But we're going to work with it in a minute.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_00
 That's very simple and it's easy to draw your findings and drawings in there.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_00
 Then a short thing about documents.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_00
 We've got our shared folder, project document, I think.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_00
 But all of you have all found it already because there are a lot of documents in it already, and these are available on the smartboards as well.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_00
 If you have a document you want to show, just open it from the folder.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_00
 Here is the simple toolbar.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_00
 It's what I just said, it's safe, print, move back or forward one page.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_00
 You can switch between the different drawings.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_00
 Then we're going to try out the whiteboard.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_00
 As you can see, we're going to draw an animal.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_00
 Just to get a bit familiar with it.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not supposed to run away.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_00
 Is anybody playing with the mouse?

0:07:55	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to draw an animal.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_00
 Just sum up a few of its favorite characteristics.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_00
 The only thing we have to look after is that we use different colors and different line with this.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_00
 I can start from there.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_00
 You can use this pen by holding it like a little child because if you hold it like this, the sensors will get blocked and the drawing won't get good.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_00
 Another thing is you have to be a bit slow because if you're going to draw it really fast, then the pen won't hold up.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_00
 We choose four month.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_00
 Current color, I think gray is appropriate.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_00
 Then the line width, I think seven will be nice.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_00
 Now you'll see my drawing capabilities.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_00
 It means another very much.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_00
 You have to do it real slow.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_00
 I'm trying to draw a dolphin.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_00
 I'm thinking about a short fish.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_00
 We've got another function.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_00
 You can do this easily.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_00
 I've got to write down a few of its characteristics.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_00
 You've got no text tool?

0:10:28	SPEAKER_00
 This is typically a new action.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe I have to hold it a bit upside down.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's it because if you want to do it like this, it will be a stripe.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_00
 This is not my work.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_00
 I think it wants to draw another animal.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_00
 It lives for the fin.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_00
 It's my characteristic about the dolphin.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_00
 Now I'm going to hand over the pen on a new blank sheet to you.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to draw a black.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not an artist, but here we go.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_00
 It's easier to draw with a smaller line.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_00
 I did.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not an artist.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, this is my, um, cheap.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_00
 It's nice with, of course.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_01
 Blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_00
 It's a real dead sheep.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, recognition.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you can also write your name somewhere.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_01
 They are.

0:14:10	None
 Come on.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_01
 Let's go really slow when you're writing.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_01
 They're brilliant animals.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_01
 And that's just a little me thing.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_01
 So, I guess I'll pass the pen to her.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, let's use her interface.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just going to add her to her head.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_01
 Let's see.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_00
 Sweet.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_01
 You know what other it is?

0:16:15	SPEAKER_01
 Garfule.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_01
 So, I'll just try something else.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_01
 Something different than Garfule.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_01
 I'm a little bit more skinny.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_00
 This is your kid.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_00
 Did you find him on the street?

0:17:37	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it's supposed to be a cat.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_01
 I like cats because they are, uh, independent.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_01
 So, okay.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_00
 That's pretty clear.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_00
 So, everybody knows how to work with the whiteboard now.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_00
 So, if you have any ideas or if you want to draw anything on the whiteboard, you can go ahead.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_00
 We're being home.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_00
 So, we've got the tool introduction.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_00
 Move along to the project finance.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_00
 As you can see, we, for a remote control, selling price is 25 euros, our selling price.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_00
 Our profit aim is 50 million euros.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_00
 That's the least we have to get from our remote controls.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_00
 So, we have to work together to reach our aims.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_00
 We can do it international.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_00
 So, we have to focus on different kind of users, different kind of cultures and different kind of trends as well.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_00
 But that's all in the later stadium.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_00
 Our production cost, um, can be maximal 12 and a half euros.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_00
 So, that's also a point we have to keep in mind that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside and stuff like that.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_00
 So, we're going to do a little bit of work.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_00
 So, just try to remember these points.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_00
 Selling price is 25 profit aims, 50 million, but more important is the international market we're trying to focus on.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_00
 And production costs maximal 12 and a half euros.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_00
 So, that leads us to our little discussion.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_00
 So, I'm going to sit down and think.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_00
 It's easier.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_00
 I've got a message.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_00
 Five minutes.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, that's a good timing.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_01
 So, just on the side now, why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen?

0:20:15	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you have to say the magic word.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_00
 Does it do anything?

0:20:22	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you have to just clap it down.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_00
 Back up again.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_01
 It's off.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_00
 It's off.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_00
 I have to put it back.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_01
 It'll be okay.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it was on.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_00
 It's those laptops.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, there we are.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_00
 Nice.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_00
 But does everybody else experience this with remote controls?

0:20:57	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, not the ordinary remote controls, but also a little bit different ones.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_00
 Like you can use for other.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_00
 No, really.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we're not here.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_01
 Kind of brought TV at home and a DVD player.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_01
 So, we've got a lot of remote controls.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_01
 One for the TV, one for the video recorder, one for the DVD player.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_01
 And I think it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate the mall.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_00
 I've got one at home.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_00
 You can program, I think, eight different devices in it.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_00
 And you can use it for your television.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_00
 Anything else.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_00
 And it also operates on infrared.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_00
 So, you've got a little device inside your room.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_00
 And then you can operate it from the third or the second floor.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, really?

0:21:49	SPEAKER_00
 So, that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or DVD player downstairs.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_00
 And you've got a link to your TV on the second floor.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_00
 So, that's a pretty handy thing.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_00
 But only the, I think, if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, it makes it a lot easier as well.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_00
 It's good to remember.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_01
 So, I think you can take minutes again.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_00
 It's nice.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_00
 So, we want different functions.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_00
 And we can maybe see if we can do something with infrared.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_00
 But I don't know if that will exceed the production costs.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_00
 So, that's something we have to find out, I think.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_01
 But that would be really good if we could do that.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_00
 And other functions for remote control.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can make it, I think it has to be shockproof.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_01
 It has shockproof.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_01
 My remote control tends to fall a lot.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_01
 So, I would, I mean, yeah.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_00
 What a proof.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_00
 So, a few things we can think of.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_00
 I will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_01
 One other little thing.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 I thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_01
 So, you can see that it stays.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_01
 How much is left in the battery?

0:23:34	SPEAKER_01
 But they'll also really drag up the production costs.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_01
 But maybe just a little led.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_00
 That's an idea as well.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_00
 Other ideas?

0:23:49	SPEAKER_00
 Quick ideas.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_01
 Nope.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_01
 They were all mentioned.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_00
 Any questions about this presentation?

0:23:57	SPEAKER_00
 Kick off presentation.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_01
 Nope.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think so.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_00
 Then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_00
 And then we can all work.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_00
 Finish meeting now.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_00
 We can all work on our own projects.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_00
 Then I'll meet you in about half an hour, I think.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_00
 So, good luck.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yep.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:25:05	None
 Okay.

0:25:13	None
 Okay.

0:25:20	None
 Okay.

0:25:24	None
 Okay.

0:25:27	None
 Okay.

0:25:29	None
 Okay.
