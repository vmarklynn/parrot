0:00:00	SPEAKER_00
 Good morning.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_00
 Good morning.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_00
 I see you all find your places.

0:00:20	SPEAKER_00
 Everybody's sitting on the right place.

0:00:24	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_00
 First I'll introduce myself.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if everybody knows me.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_00
 I'm Bart.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_00
 Hello.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_00
 Hello.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_00
 Bart.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_00
 Hello.

0:00:45	SPEAKER_00
 Hello.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_00
 Hello.

0:00:47	None
 Bart.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_00
 Welcome.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_00
 Let's start off with a little presentation.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_00
 First I'll tell you a little bit about the setting.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_00
 You can see the few cameras here.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_00
 They'll record our actions.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_00
 And you all have wires and microphones.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_00
 They will record your voice.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_00
 There are also some microphones there.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_00
 But you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those, because it will disappear when you don't intend to do it.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_00
 So this is our project documents folder.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_00
 There are some notes you need already.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_00
 I see some documents.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_00
 I'll start with the presentation kickoff.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_00
 It's a great experience.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_00
 It's been modified by the administrator.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_00
 Let's do it read only.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I don't know if you've noticed, but we are working for real reaction.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_00
 It's a company in electronics.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_00
 We put fashion in electronics.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_00
 We make it work.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_00
 in Bartbaute and Project Manager.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_00
 So I'll direct you through the project.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_00
 This is our agenda.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_00
 We have our opening acquaintance tool training project plan discussion closing.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe I can sit down.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_00
 Then I can take some notes or let's see.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_00
 It's not a lot of work.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_00
 If you hear something, you can write down.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_00
 Just write it down.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_00
 As you can see, it's the opening acquaintance tool training acquaintance.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_00
 This is a point we've done a bit.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_00
 Have you all seen the corporate website already?

0:03:04	SPEAKER_00
 Have you seen any flaws in it?

0:03:07	SPEAKER_00
 I think I found one.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_01
 Can't say I paid much attention to it, but.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_00
 I can see if it works.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_00
 This one.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_00
 No, it doesn't work here.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_00
 OK, no problem.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_00
 But on the corporate information side, there was real remote instead of real reaction.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_00
 Real remote is not really the company we are, but it's just a little.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_00
 Beautiful.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_00
 OK, what are we going to do?

0:03:43	SPEAKER_00
 Our project aim is, as you can see, a new remote control.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_00
 It has to be original, trendy, and user-friendly.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_00
 So these are the points where we also hired you.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_00
 We've got the marketing expert for the trendy and user-friendly look and industrial designer.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_00
 That's also user-friendly and a bit original.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_00
 And we've got our user interface designer.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_00
 So that's about the new remote control.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_00
 Project method is there are three phases we're going through.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_00
 First is functional design, individual work meetings.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_00
 After the functional design, then the conceptual design and the detailed design, I had some real indications on here.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_00
 But I think you know it already by yourself.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_00
 Industrial designer is going to work on the working design, components design, and a bit of the look and feel design.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_00
 The user interface designer is going to do the technical function design, user interface concept, and user interface design.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_00
 And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirements, specification, trend-watching, and project-evaluation.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_00
 So that's a bit what you're going to do.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_00
 But that will be all worked out in other meetings.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_00
 Then we've got our first tool training.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_00
 So it's handy if we have a little bit of training first.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_00
 As you can see, we've got the smart boards here and here and the white boards.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_00
 In the white board here, there's a little toolbar on this side.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_00
 Here are some functions we can save.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_00
 These functions we don't have anything to do with.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_00
 Only undo you can do a little piece of drawing.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_00
 A blank new document for each person.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_00
 Select a pen, razor, capture, redone, that's to do anything with.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_00
 Then we've got our pen, this pen.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_00
 It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_00
 In the, I think it is formal.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_00
 You can also select the current color and the line with.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_00
 With that first, you have to select the pen function.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to work with it in a minute.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_00
 So, okay.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_00
 That's very simple and it's easy to draw your findings and drawings on there.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_00
 Then, a short thing about documents.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_00
 We've got our shared folder, project, project documents, I think.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_00
 But all you all found that already because there are a lot of documents you need already, so that will be okay.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_00
 These are available on the smart boards as well.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_00
 So, if you have a document you want to show, just open it from the folder.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_00
 Here is the simple toolbar.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_00
 It's what I just said.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_00
 It's safe, print, move back or forward, one page.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_00
 You can switch between the different drawings.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_00
 And then we're going to try out the whiteboard.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_00
 So, as you can see, we go to draw an animal just to get a bit familiar with it.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_00
 I was supposed to run away.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_00
 Is everybody playing with the mouse?

0:07:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. We're going to draw an animal.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_00
 And just sum up a few of its favorite characteristics.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_00
 The only thing we have to look after is that we use different colors and different lines with this.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_00
 I can start from now.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_00
 You can use this pen by holding it like a little child because if you hold it like this, the sensors will get blocked and the drawing won't get good.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_00
 Another thing is you have to be a bit slow because if you're going to draw it really fast, then the pen won't hold up.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_00
 So, we choose Format, current color.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_00
 I think gray is appropriate.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_00
 Then the line width.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_00
 I think 7 will be nice.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_00
 Now you will see my drawing capabilities.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_00
 There's another very much.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_00
 Here I have to do it real slow.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, listen.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_01
 Shark.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_00
 I'm trying to draw a dolphin.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's not as stupid as it is.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_01
 I'm thinking about a short fish.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_00
 It's a bit of a short fish.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_00
 Now we've got another function.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_00
 We've got the eraser.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_00
 And then you can do this easily.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_00
 I've got to write down a few of his characteristics.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_00
 You've got no text tool.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_00
 This is typically a do-action, I think.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe I have to hold it a bit upside down.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's it because if you are going to do it like this, then it will be a stripe.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_00
 Just trying.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_00
 This is not my work.

0:11:04	None
 Maybe I have to use it.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's wants to draw another animal.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's going to be a little bit more difficult to draw a dolphin.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's going to be a little bit more difficult to draw a dolphin.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's going to be a little bit more difficult to draw a dolphin.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's going to be a little bit more difficult to draw a dolphin.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not much an artist, but here we go.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it's easier to draw a smaller line with, I think.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's going a lot better than I did.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's going to be a little bit more difficult to draw a dolphin.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's going to be a little bit more difficult to draw a dolphin.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's nice.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 Of course.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_01
 It's a real dead sheep.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can also write your name somewhere.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_01
 Let's go really slow when you're writing.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_01
 They're brilliant animals, and that's just a little me thing.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_01
 I guess I'll pass the pen to her.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_01
 It's using the face design.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just going to draw its head.

0:14:58	None
 Okay.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:15:37	None
 Okay.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_01
 Sweet.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_01
 You know what that is?

0:16:15	SPEAKER_00
 Garfield.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_00
 Garfield.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I was going to draw a cat too, so I'll just try something else.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_01
 Something different than Garfield.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_01
 Mine is a bit more skinny.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_01
 But what about the most interesting tool?

0:17:27	SPEAKER_00
 Is it your cat or did you find him on the street?

0:17:35	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it's supposed to be a cat.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_01
 I like cats because they are right.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_01
 They are right.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_01
 They are right.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_00
 That's pretty clear.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_00
 So everybody knows how to work with the wideboard now.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_00
 So if you have any ideas or if you want to draw anything on the wideboard, just ask and go ahead.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_00
 It's pretty easy.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_00
 We're being honed.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_00
 So we've got the tool introduction.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_00
 We move along to the project finance.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_00
 As you can see, for remote control, a selling price is 25 euros.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_00
 Our selling price.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_00
 Our profit aim is 50 million euros.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_00
 That's the least we have to get from our remote controls.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to work together to reach our aims.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_00
 We can do it international.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to focus on different kind of users, different kind of cultures, and different kind of trends as well.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_00
 But that's all in the later stadium.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_00
 Our production cost can be maximal 12.5 euros.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_00
 So that's also a point we have to keep in mind that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside and stuff like that.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_00
 Point work.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_00
 So just try to remember these points.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_00
 The selling price is 25 profit aims, 50 million, but more important is the international market we're trying to focus on.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_00
 And production cost, maximal 12.5 euros.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_00
 So that leads us to our little discussion.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_00
 We've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm going to sit down and think.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_00
 It's easier.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_00
 I've got a message.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_00
 Five minutes.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. That's a good timing.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_01
 So just on the side note, why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen?

0:20:14	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you have to say to make your grid.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_00
 Does it do anything?

0:20:22	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you have to just clap it down.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_00
 Back up again.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_01
 It's off.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_00
 It's off.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_00
 I have to put it back.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_00
 It'll be okay.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_01
 What was on?

0:20:43	SPEAKER_00
 It's those laptops.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_01
 Nice.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_00
 But, so, this everybody has experiences with remote controls.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, not the ordinary remote controls, but also a little bit different ones.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_00
 Like you can use for other.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_01
 No way.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we're on the other.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_01
 Kind of brought TV at home.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_01
 And the DVD player.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_01
 So we got like a lot of remote controls.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_01
 One for the TV, one for the video recorder, one for the DVD player.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_01
 And I think it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate the mall.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I've got one at home.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_00
 And you can program, I think, eight different devices in it.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_00
 And you can use it for your television.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_00
 Anything else.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_00
 And it also operates on infrared.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_00
 So you have to got a little device inside your room.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_00
 And then you can operate it from the third or second floor.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_00
 So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or DVD player downstairs.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_00
 And you've got a link to your TV on the second floor.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_00
 So that's a pretty handy thing.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_00
 But only the, I think, if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, the next is a lot easier as well.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_00
 It's good to remember.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_01
 So I think you can take minutes again.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_00
 It's nice.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_00
 So we want different functions.

0:22:24	None
 Yeah.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_00
 And we can maybe see if we can do something with infrared.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_00
 But I don't know if that will exceed the production cost.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_00
 So there's something we have to find out, I think.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_01
 But that would be really good if we could do that.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_00
 And other functions for remote control.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can make it the, it has to be sharp proof.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_01
 Sharp proof.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_01
 My remote control tends to follow a lot.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_01
 So should never know.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, what I prove.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_00
 So these are a few things we can think of.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_00
 I will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, one other little thing.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_01
 I thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_01
 So we can see the battery status.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_01
 How much is left in the battery?

0:23:33	SPEAKER_01
 But they'll also really drag up the production costs.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_01
 We'll have to see about that too.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_01
 But maybe just a little bit.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_00
 That's an idea as well.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_00
 Other ideas?

0:23:48	SPEAKER_00
 Quick ideas.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_01
 They were all mentioned.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_00
 Any questions about this presentation?

0:23:56	SPEAKER_00
 Click off presentation.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_01
 Nope.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_00
 Then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_00
 And then we can all work finish meeting now.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_00
 And we can all work on our own projects.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_00
 Then I'll meet you in about half an hour, I think.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_00
 So good luck.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:45	None
 Okay.
