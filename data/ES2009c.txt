0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 That's great.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. All right. Let me just PowerPoint this out.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_03
 All right. Let me just PowerPoint this out.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_03
 All right. So this meeting will be about the conceptual design. Don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is. It's just something important that we need to do.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's kind of turning the abstract into slightly more concrete and this meeting ideally will come to some final decisions on what we're going to do for the prototype.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_03
 Right. So apologies for the last meeting. It was brought to my attention that I did not make the rules clear enough. So I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_03
 Fair enough. Thanks for the input. It's always good.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_03
 So basically all we're going to do is have some presentations again much like last time. I'm going to go through you.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_03
 Whoever wants to go first is fine by me and we'll collate what we know about what we discussed in the last meeting possible directions.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_03
 And then we'll make some more decisions on basic firm up our idea how we want this remote control to look and work.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_03
 So perfect. So without further ado. Whoever wants to go first is free to go first. All right. Take it away.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_03
 It is Nathan. I'm not calling the wrong name over Nathan's fire. Good.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to go further Nathan or participant to Mr. participant to that is. Okay. Nice.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_00
 Basically what I'm going to have to talk to you about today is component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_00
 Basically what I'm going to be doing is talking to you about that components of remote control. Okay. We've already kind of gone over this but we have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions sometimes soon.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_00
 Energy source. Our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources. Your standard battery.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_00
 Solar cells. Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium. So we might have to look if we do go that route. We might have to look elsewhere.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_00
 And also there's a kinetic energy possibility. Basically it's like a idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_00
 So that's one possible. But I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touchscreen. So we'll have to look into that.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_00
 The case we have a few options. Plastic rubber or wood. And then as far as the way it's shaped we can do standard born flat which we probably don't want to do curved or very sexy double curved.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_00
 What kind of thickness are we looking at? I imagine that we could specify.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_00
 I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimeters.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_00
 The buttons. There are multiple scope buttons available for manufacturer but to use those who would have to use more chips.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_00
 And that would cost us more. And if we do go with rubber double curved case.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_00
 We'll have to use rubber push buttons. Because the other buttons aren't compatible with that.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_00
 And just a little note there. Touch screen equals many chips which equals many heroes.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_00
 One thing that I noticed is that most remotes operate on the infrared part of the spectrum.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_00
 So you notice when you push a button on your remote you can't see anything coming out of it. But in fact there is light coming out of the remote and the television conduct.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_00
 And if you were to record, if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_00
 One thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the mode just kind of as a fun gimmick.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_00
 You could actually see something coming out of the remote when you push it. Of course there have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human off.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe is there an option that we could have that offer on so a person could select like.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I'm sure that we could do that.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's a good idea.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, just as a fun gimmick. Just set us apart a little bit.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_00
 And then onto the circuit board that we're going to use also moves the chip. We really don't have any where around the TA 11835.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_00
 Findings. Okay, we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_00
 And my question to all of you is should we look to other manufacturers which is making to you with what we have available.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_02
 That's a bit of a challenge question. Like say shop around but with our time constraints is that really a feasible option.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_00
 Right, that's my concern too.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_00
 If we do go to the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside currently.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_00
 My personal preferences I'll just throw my cards on the table.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_00
 I think we should probably go to solar battery route just to kind of keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_00
 I like the idea of the visible light signaling is something to set us apart.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_00
 And I was thinking about was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote and a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_00
 So we're not so confined by one style and say so you know say I the one if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_03
 Can we do marketing piloting to try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they received.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_02
 It's an option. Actually there's I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, which actually might even come into play beforehand.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_02
 Okay perfect.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_02
 Great. Thank you very much.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_03
 It's perfect. So I guess that makes sense for you to take a perimeter.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_02
 I guess so.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_02
 Because I found some interesting things.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_02
 Fascinating.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_02
 I know. I wanted to hear.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_02
 So current market trends screen.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_02
 Basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields to see sort of what's what's trendy what's new what's happening.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_02
 Remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer fancier more exciting their sake of this boring normal functional that we need innovative design options and it needs to be an easy user interface.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_02
 The challenge is that current trends right now across the board in fashion in furniture in technology is a very organic.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_02
 A very comfortable kind of thing.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_02
 We should have you know tomato shaped remote controls or anything but I think it is possible maybe to use natural colors like if wood is an option that whole organic sleek clean.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_02
 So if you're seeing maybe something we can look into different skin options or if we can't afford this touch plate thing or touch face screen interface maybe having the images be specific like you could choose your menu bullets to be.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_02
 Okay not the example I would choose but you know what I mean to sort of and apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy not something I come up with a definitely a strand though if we can get around to getting piloting I thought maybe a casing option like

0:08:37	SPEAKER_00
 not like a skin but like a holder almost if you could do like leather options or wood options or something I should have mentioned this as far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case it has a consistency of those

0:08:53	SPEAKER_02
 stress balls might be a way to go slick yeah so something to sit on for now so overall I think we should stick with what we're finding every is looking for easy use technology innovative and this fancy new I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_00
 Oh the interface graphics for the well I but then if touch screen thing is work out for us that's really no issue I like the idea of rubber it's here because it's 10 set be associated with being durable something that you can drop and it doesn't so many you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote control.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah it's like with duct tape. You would have a phone. You could have a duct tape. I think that goes against the whole fancy something.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah that's what I know.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_03
 Great thanks for that Sarah. Run.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_01
 Here is just one moment. So interface concept by your faithful user interface.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_01
 So you don't use your interface guys is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or here or otherwise perceive commands and mechanisms that basically user uses to control the operating operating system.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_01
 Here's a series of different controls that are out on the market today.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_01
 I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look. So the following are a bunch of different interface concepts voice recognition we actually have some new information from our research design team but get to that in a moment.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_01
 So current voice recognition starts up to about 80 speech samples and basically you record your own verbal labels and connect them to the remote control.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_01
 Now our design team research team has been able to set up a system in which you can teach the remote control voice recognition system to respond to you with standard responses like you could say good morning.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_01
 In fact we already have this for a copy maker line.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_01
 A lot of single people on the other. Another concept is what Apple has come up with is spinning wheel with LC display like on the iPods which I'm sure most you know.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_01
 We have this scroll button with indicator push button like a modern boss of embaldy a bit crazy. I don't think that's what we're necessarily going for.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_01
 So ideas like blocking having the ability to block channels from your for your children and dedicated buttons for commonly used channels and even ideas like secured or hidden programming but again if we go with that screen I don't think that's a big issue.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_01
 This is kind of the big daddy. The Jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to miss places.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_01
 Again probably not what we're going for so I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod with a hard classic classic casing.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_01
 The team was possibly talking about including one extra faceplate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our bottom line touch screen interface possibly having go to buttons being stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_01
 So I think that's one of the things that I think is that you can use the same thing as the other ones like power volume and jump between channels.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_01
 And of course our voice commands is similar to what I've talked a little bit about already. And the use of recognizable colors in shape state recognition of the features that are around so red per power arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and whatnot.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_01
 So I love seeing you and adding in some super little jokes with the voice recognition idea like for instance my toasty maker that I got from my bank has jokes when it's ready.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_01
 Nice. Great and bad is about it.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_03
 Great wonderful run. Cool.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_03
 A lot of good ideas, good facts to have.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_03
 That's what they need is like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_03
 Right so good to know all that stuff. Thanks guys.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_03
 We know we can have to come to some decisions figure we can just go to the line all three of us can have a chat about it.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_03
 Based on what Nathan presented as far as the various costs and benefits. I think I don't know what do you got to think about the touchscreen at this point.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_02
 But can we really afford it because it looks like they would be that would be a really main cost source then right.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_00
 My estimate is that in order to incorporate touchscreen technology is going to cost us upwards of 1750 euro.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_01
 That's pretty much what it is. That's just an estimate.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_01
 You guys are always the dampers on these.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_01
 You're industrial design. I know.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 And our goal was to be under 1250 or we have to be under 1250.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_00
 Well I thought there was some flexibility with that.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_03
 There is it's just it is a question of how much does that mean we're going to have to increase the price to make money.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_03
 From 1250 if we want to get a 100% profit margin that would mean selling it for 25.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_03
 If you multiply 1750 by 2 that's 35.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_01
 So where do you guys come up with these numbers?

0:16:22	SPEAKER_00
 I just have to talk my head.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_00
 It is pending for their emails from the board.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_02
 Well do I think that's what people would pay for.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_02
 If you're going to pay for an expensive high class remote you're going to expect to do something.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_00
 That's true. It would be in a class of a gem.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_03
 And to be fair the percent of the market we're not going for mass sales anyway.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_03
 We're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_03
 We just couldn't not for 25 euros.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_03
 We could probably maybe shrink the profit margin rather than selling for 25, sell them for 30.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_03
 But that's something we can have finance deal with.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_03
 I say that we provisionally go with the tax screen.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_03
 What was your thought of the matter on?

0:17:18	SPEAKER_01
 I'm thinking that's definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper means to go about this kind of production might.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_01
 My team and the on the third floor suggested that.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_02
 Well we can look into this other manufacturing option.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_02
 I mean we can get them somewhere else cheaper.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_00
 We could initially go with what we have and we can find a shifter.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_03
 Starting point anyway.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_03
 We could have a simple touch screen.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_03
 I guess we can play around with it.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_03
 Let's say the touchscreen will be our main selling point here.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_01
 I think we have two main selling points.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's what our case and the voice record.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_02
 This is pretty bells and whistles.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_03
 The voice rack thing, if we're looking at bottom line, now we're looking at the cost of 17 to get the touchscreen on.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_03
 I think we might have to drop the voice rack.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_02
 I think we have to decide between them definitely.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_01
 To be honest, we have the design in-house.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_01
 We've come up with this.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_01
 We're using a perikoppy machine already.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_01
 I can pass you on that email from my guy down the hall.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_03
 Sounds good.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_03
 What do you think about the voice rack?

0:18:48	SPEAKER_00
 I think if we do both, the production costs are going to go away up.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_00
 But it does put it into, it becomes the role's rise of remote control basically.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_01
 We have to reflect back on what our market research said.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_02
 They said they wanted voice recognition.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe they hadn't thought of this little touchscreen option.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_02
 But definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_02
 To say we have the technology and we're not going to use it even though we know it'll sell.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_02
 It's a call I don't think I can give the high-ups.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_02
 I can't go ahead and say no.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_02
 We're going to stick to everything we know.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_01
 Does having both really have our costs?

0:19:33	SPEAKER_03
 I can't see how it wouldn't.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_03
 There's the old aphorism.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_03
 You can have it fast.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_03
 You can have it cheap.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_03
 You can have it quality.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_00
 You can't have all three.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_00
 You need to deal with each different function.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_03
 If we're going to pick between one and two.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_03
 Otherwise, we just become cost prohibitive.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_03
 But which do we suspect we should hold on to?

0:20:06	SPEAKER_02
 We already have research backing voice recognition as basically solvent.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_02
 But I personally would tend to the other direction.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_02
 But if that's what's going to sell, I think that's what we need to go with.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we can table this touchscreen for our next model.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_00
 I would have to side with that.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_00
 The voice recognition is simple.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_00
 We already have all the technology in the house.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_00
 It's ready to go.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_00
 It's packaged.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_03
 What does the cost look like?

0:20:40	SPEAKER_03
 Is it cheaper to do the VR to do the touchscreen?

0:20:44	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it's just off the top of my head.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_00
 Keep in mind.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_00
 I think the voice recognition would...

0:20:53	SPEAKER_00
 They're both going to push the cost up.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_00
 But since we already have the technology in the house for the voice recognition, we're not going to have to do as much design work.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_00
 And sometimes design work is what push the cost up.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_00
 If you know what I mean.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_01
 I definitely have to agree with that.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_02
 And then we don't have to deal with this battery issue really as much either.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_02
 We can stick with what we've already got in a lot of other ways too.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm getting more or less of the two of them in the voice recognition will be better.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's our lower risk option.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_02
 We can have it on the market sooner, which is all in all our best option.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_03
 Sort it.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_03
 We will omit the touchscreen in favor of voice recognition.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_02
 So when are we going to have basic prototypes coming up next?

0:21:47	SPEAKER_02
 That's you guys next step, right?

0:21:49	SPEAKER_03
 Well, sort of what else we're going to talk about for the prototype.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_03
 But yeah, that's our next step.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_00
 Are we going to talk now about the materials we're going to use for the case?

0:22:00	SPEAKER_03
 We'll just run through it.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_03
 We've discussed either a lithium or a solar power.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_03
 Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition?

0:22:11	SPEAKER_03
 Or this kinesthetic one?

0:22:12	SPEAKER_03
 Would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition removal?

0:22:15	SPEAKER_00
 The solar power definitely would be, but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed because sometimes solar power fails, there's no around that.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_00
 We should install a small backup battery just to cover those moments when whatever reason that remote has a box of it.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it looks like TV in their basement.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_00
 Like, where?

0:22:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_02
 We can't guarantee so many of it everywhere.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_02
 So having a factory source is probably what we're going to do.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it works about the same as a solar powered calculator.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_00
 And you know how those, those don't really require that much light.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_00
 Obviously, a little more light than a calculator, but we're not talking about a lot of light.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't have to be out taking a sun bath.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_00
 And everything.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_01
 What do you think, Rob?

0:22:57	SPEAKER_01
 I'm willing to do a review of everything that's been said.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_01
 I have to say, though, that another idea has come up in my head.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_01
 If we're really not handling the remote control to a great extent, you could possibly get away from the idea of having a handheld remote control and maybe kind of have around remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_01
 Kind of a sweet little, uh, anything that sits on your table or something.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_02
 Interesting.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_02
 Why?

0:23:27	SPEAKER_01
 Just a thought.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_00
 Why moving away from handheld?

0:23:30	SPEAKER_00
 Why?

0:23:31	SPEAKER_00
 It's the end.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if you don't need to pick it up, it could kind of be a selling point.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_02
 It's got voice recognition.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_02
 It can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_00
 Do you think people that are, people that buy your motor, they always want to use the voice recognition?

0:23:44	SPEAKER_00
 Is it just something that they do sometimes?

0:23:46	SPEAKER_02
 True.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_02
 And probably, I think we're bang on selling it to more than just voice recognition people.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_02
 Like, we want it to work fundamentally.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_03
 We have that button on it, too, as well.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_03
 But that's done.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_03
 That's no bother.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, if you look at the catalog from places like the Sharper Image or whatever, you know, they might have.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_03
 Or like, um, who is it?

0:24:06	SPEAKER_03
 Apple makes these really pretentious speakers.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_03
 What the subwoofers, you know, like clear and glass and, you know, they got the little pyramidal type of speakers.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, why not have a little rounded kind of thing?

0:24:18	SPEAKER_03
 It could still have the basic buttons on it.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_03
 Because we're going for basic functionality primarily as well.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_03
 It's about, yeah.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_03
 And maybe a menu button, so forth, you know, um, use the channel button to scroll through the menu if they want to record programs or whatever, you know, I think you're onto something.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_00
 We need to escape the traditional shape of remote.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe something that looks nice on a table is, would be good, even though Anne handheld the same time.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's all about following Apple's week.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I'm thinking of the airport portal, you know, like that little pod-looking thing.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's right.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I mean, I mean, although we do, um, we're calling that she mentioned, we need to get away from the surgical white kind of brush to the building and I'm thinking, get back to it.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_03
 But you could have a very tasteful, um, wood colored or earth tone kind of, um,

0:25:10	SPEAKER_02
 Terracotta bowl or something.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_03
 Still, I mean, yeah, along those lines. Yeah, I like that.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_03
 I like that idea a lot.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_03
 Let's see what we can do as far as that goes.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_03
 And the, uh, the material, like the plastics and so forth, we were discussing that being, uh, using like a rubber kind of softer feel.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_03
 Um, you know, I, if you feel a, the tip on this pen is a bit, gives just a bit.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_03
 You know, something where it's a, a more advanced form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_00
 Just kind of the squishy feel.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_02
 Which is the next big thing.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_02
 So that's not going to hurt us either.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control looking remote control.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_03
 But to be fair, yeah, I mean, you just, you could just put it literally put it on the night, the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_03
 I like it.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_03
 I like that.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_03
 That's good.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_03
 Um, and we've sort of discussed costs.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_03
 Um, I guess we'll, that's going to be, uh, I think if we run a bit over budget, it might be okay.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry about the lack of information costs.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_00
 I just haven't been provided information by manufacturers.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_00
 We'll have more ideas.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_03
 We'll have more of that later on.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we'll just go from there.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_03
 So we've revisited the touchscreen and more or less ruled that out.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_03
 I think so we're more or less can, we were more or less in agreement that we want to have a, um, a simple kind of function, you know, not too complex.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_02
 Well, when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis, although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions, they should be secondary.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_02
 At least if not functionally, then visually like those shouldn't be right.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we have many things.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_00
 If, if we're not going to touch screen root, then we can, um, just incorporate maybe something that folds out.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_00
 Like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions appear.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_00
 Something that slides down and to reveal, you know, the more complicated things.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we want to consider like an iPod screen, which isn't a touch screen, but you're still scrolling through menu options.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_01
 Then we're hitting our cost issue again.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_03
 And we've also got the thing of, we're going to have a non-remote looking remote.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_03
 How do we, yeah.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_03
 You know, I mean, we could do a slide or a compartment, you know, like if it's say it's a little vaguely avoidable type of thing, it'd be easy to have a compartment in there.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_03
 Or, you know, a series of, you know, three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side and up and down type of thing like on a DVD player.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_03
 You know, you see the modern DVD players, they'll just have a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_03
 And you can just kind of maneuver through the menu like that.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_00
 So are we going, are we talking, we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use, are we going to use scroll buttons, rubber buttons.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it seems like, no, no, it seems to me that we could just do the, um, stick with the rubber, because it's probably going to be using some kind of, um, rubber for the outside case, you might as well stick with that.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_01
 I think to a certain extent we have to stick with, uh, kind of a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then, and then make our unique future or chasing and whatnot.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_01
 And our place can that.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_02
 Well, those basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you want to do it are really versatile and.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_02
 Every's already got them to some extent, I'm a most dirty owned so it's not like we're dealing with every re learning things because that's not something anybody's going to want to buy before.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_03
 Um, we've already kind of covered this as well.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_03
 That seems to be selling.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_03
 Um, and we're more or less agree that we want to target this youth market.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_03
 Um, especially now with 18 of 35 year olds being so large quantity of the population, particularly in technological fields.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_02
 So, um, it's exactly what we're headed.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_03
 Um, yeah, all right.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_03
 Well, more or less covered what we need to cover, I think, find, even you find the thoughts before we think about doing the product, moving out of the prototype.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_01
 Well, what are we actually doing?

0:29:43	SPEAKER_03
 Right. I was just going to step on to, um, uh, oh, it wasn't in the way, but it wasn't my bad.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_03
 I was just going to assign tasks in the next year.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_03
 Any other final thoughts before we go ahead and cool.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_00
 How do we decide that we are going to go with different style cases for different people? Or are we just going to go with one?

0:30:17	SPEAKER_00
 It's very, it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases and that might open up your market.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_00
 Well, obviously, but you have just one case and it doesn't go over well.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's a situation, but obviously having more cases also costs more.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_03
 Well, then again, colors wouldn't be so hard to do. You could have a natural wood color like a stained wood.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know, olive green or something.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_03
 That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the color of the rubber.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_01
 And again, copying iMacs kind of for iPod Mac Apple's color scheme.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, totally.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think that's probably good. Okay, so let's work on multiple case colors.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_03
 But yes, it's with the same kind of kind of, yeah, the same basic non-remote kind of remote design.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_03
 Cool.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_03
 All right, so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_03
 I want the, I'd like Nathan, I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_03
 What can we accomplish given these parameters that we sort of sorted out this kind of a non-remote remote?

0:31:38	SPEAKER_03
 What are our broad constraints before we design a prototype?

0:31:42	SPEAKER_03
 And Ron, if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of the simple design with the voice recognition built in.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_03
 And also this kind of drop down or on the side kind of menu options simple.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_03
 Somehow work out how we can get this all in the same place.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_03
 And if you can check product evaluation with some pilots and stuff, I need you guys to work together making a prototype using prototype building materials.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_03
 And also specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_03
 So that's what to start with for now.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_03
 Is that all right?

0:32:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, that's so good.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_03
 All right, I guess we'll just hit the bricks.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_03
 Thanks guys.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.
