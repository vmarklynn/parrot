0:10:07	SPEAKER_04
 Tak, cesanya Ya.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_04
 5.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_04
 So the concept was interface.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_04
 Generally I developed quite a broad concept, not only for the interface but for possible instruction or user manual and all the complex things that come together with your tv and remote controls.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_04
 So let's start with this.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_04
 We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons and we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and it will take it some days to learn all these buttons and the LCD is going to be somewhere here and go back button.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know where it is, maybe one of these buttons and power on and off.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_04
 I don't remember.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_04
 So it should be, maybe this button is power on and off or no info.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_04
 I can see nothing.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_04
 So it's our concept.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_04
 It's called the Millennium Remote Control.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_05
 Let's change Millenniums.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe you can use for those in the US.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_05
 That doesn't make sense.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_05
 This is very...

0:11:30	SPEAKER_05
 Really?

0:11:32	SPEAKER_04
 I can't.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_04
 I thought you'll like it.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_03
 No, I don't know.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, just press the button and say something.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we will not use this.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_04
 We will not use this.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_04
 But instead of this ugly device,

0:11:48	SPEAKER_03
 that's our concept.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and it's got just a few buttons, quite well looking and all this stuff we already... We already discussed.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_04
 And what will people say?

0:12:05	SPEAKER_04
 They will say it's perfect.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_04
 Or what will say?

0:12:10	SPEAKER_04
 They will say it's landed.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_04
 Everyone will say, I'll buy it.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_04
 And everyone's going to be satisfied.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_05
 Do you think it can come in several colors?

0:12:25	SPEAKER_04
 Or did I would make a backlight of the LCD screen with different colors?

0:12:32	SPEAKER_04
 But not the case.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_04
 Not the case.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_05
 The case would only be in that aluminum titanium stuff.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_02
 Because apparently from your survey, people like colors.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, well, they like something which is...

0:12:48	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changes both panels.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, okay, so that would be...

0:12:54	SPEAKER_05
 Do you like it?

0:12:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_05
 I don't have a Nokia phone.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_05
 But it's...

0:12:59	SPEAKER_00
 I don't use that, but again...

0:13:01	SPEAKER_00
 That's why you don't have it.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_03
 That's why.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_03
 Because it's nasty.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_00
 But it would be expansion.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 If you use color LCD...

0:13:11	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_00
 Instead of that, maybe we can change the color of the SMB.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can just...

0:13:20	SPEAKER_00
 If you just want more colors, they can pay more money to get this...

0:13:27	SPEAKER_00
 The shapes, I mean, they can have different assembly.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_04
 Right here.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_00
 So users have different...

0:13:35	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, they have their own...

0:13:37	SPEAKER_00
 Interest, color, interest and so on.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_00
 So if they want, they can just pay another...

0:13:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so you propose something with option...

0:13:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_02
 That increase the price if we...

0:13:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_00
 If they want...

0:13:51	SPEAKER_00
 So that we can...

0:13:52	SPEAKER_00
 Of course, it's an upgradeable...

0:13:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_05
 We're both controlled.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_00
 Just they will get a few more...

0:14:00	SPEAKER_00
 Things and few more colors.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_04
 There's one more solution.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_04
 One more solution, in fact.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_04
 Because there are some...

0:14:08	SPEAKER_04
 Some paints that can change color according to where they are.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_04
 Like they can reflect different colors.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_02
 Depending on what is around.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_02
 Like what color is around.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_04
 And depending on the temperature, yeah.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_04
 Can make it in fact.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but that's maybe too much expensive.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_02
 But it can be in maybe in a...

0:14:31	SPEAKER_02
 A gradeable version.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_05
 Because I think there are two kinds of people.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_05
 Those for which the remote control is...

0:14:39	SPEAKER_05
 Is to be something useful.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_05
 I'm going to talk about this later.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_05
 But and those for which it's something that...

0:14:46	SPEAKER_05
 That is specific to them.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_05
 So it's like a signature.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_05
 My remote control is pink.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_05
 Nobody else than me has a pink remote control.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_05
 And that makes me special.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_02
 And you think that we don't have to make them pay more?

0:15:10	SPEAKER_05
 I think they would be ready for that.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_05
 Those who want it to have it big.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_02
 It's not a base service.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_04
 No, not a bad option.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_04
 It might be optional.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_00
 But those people will be really few.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_00
 So like we can cut short the...

0:15:25	SPEAKER_05
 The young people want to be different from their friends.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_05
 Although similar, but have something just slightly better.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_05
 Pink.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe that if that is a selling point, maybe it has to be the base.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but you know, if you want to be different, you just take your remote control with you all the time.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_04
 And it's very different, you know?

0:15:47	SPEAKER_03
 No, no.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, you want to pass the remote controls here?

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 You don't have to pass the remote control here.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_02
 I want to change my name.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_05
 Well, you know, for instance, take the iPod.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_05
 It's a kind of remote control.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_05
 And it's white.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_05
 And it's so white that you see it from anywhere.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_05
 It has this distinctive look and feel and look, but which people seem to like.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_05
 Just because it's a color that we don't usually see in a remote control.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_05
 White.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_05
 Uh-huh.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_04
 Uh-huh.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_04
 Could we integrate something into our remote control?

0:16:21	SPEAKER_04
 Something like a light that I can use it in darkness.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_04
 Very smart.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_00
 Can light.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_00
 The dark.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, maybe like that infrared.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_00
 Like we can put some radium chips or something.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_00
 So that like at least some radium.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_00
 I'll do a radio with this.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sorry.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_02
 So.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_04
 Well, let's go on maybe with a presentation.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sure.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_04
 And um, the remote control is going to be smart, but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_04
 And, uh, I don't know.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_04
 That's a question to you and to.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_05
 Well, so I heard that it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_05
 And so that's the smartness of the thing.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_05
 Currently, we don't have guns with speech recognition or beer cans with speech recognition, but we may have remote controls with speech recognition.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_04
 That's a nice one.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, don't touch the remote.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_05
 Thank you.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_05
 But yeah, are you saying here that the remote control should be aware of who's using it?

0:17:46	SPEAKER_05
 So for instance, the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_05
 Uh, yeah.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_04
 I just want to say it should be smart.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe fingerprint recognition.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_04
 The voice recognition is quite enough.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_04
 I say don't use it and the control just looks.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_04
 Because I ordered.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_00
 That could be feasible.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, since we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition also.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_00
 So it could be.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_00
 We can.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_00
 Smart in that way.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_05
 But for instance, I'm thinking about the other particularity that the remote control could have.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_05
 Since it knows who is using it, it might also record the kind of channels you're more often using levels of volumes that you're more often.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, sure.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_05
 Things like that and provide you ways of using them.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know somehow.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_05
 That might be expensive, but that might also be a good sales pitch again.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_05
 The remote that knows you.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_02
 So, My turn.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_02
 Marketing expert.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_05
 Sorry.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_02
 But spent four I think.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_05
 Trend.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_05
 So I'm going to talk about trends.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_05
 And then I hope this can help us to understand how we should design our remote control.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_05
 So next slide please.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_05
 So first, maybe just a small recap on how do we watch trends?

0:19:54	SPEAKER_05
 So it's not so simple.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_05
 You might think that it's easy, but it's not so simple.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_05
 Anyway, these days, the best source of information is the web, as you know.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_05
 So I have to go off and on the web and look at what the others are doing.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_05
 And ask real people who are using real remote controls every day.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_05
 Or any other tool that is similar to a remote control, which basically is a small device that people don't may have with them.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_05
 Always like a phone.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_05
 We can use the phone as a good example of where to be inspired.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_05
 Of course, those who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired, because in fact, they are not only watching the trends.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_05
 They are inventing it.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_05
 They are creating the trend.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_05
 I hope I'm going to try to help you on that.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_05
 This is more risky because you're not following the trend.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_05
 You try to invent it, which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_05
 So anyway, next slide please.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_05
 To be quick, there's a lot of words here, but basically, in the market of remote controls, there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_05
 The first one, which seems to be the most important one, is that it has to be fancy.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_05
 It has to have a fancy look and feel.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_05
 And interestingly, this is the very most important thing.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_05
 It has to be fancy.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_05
 Strangely enough, it's more important to be fancy than to be with, and now that's the second thing it has to be, it has to be technologically innovative.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_05
 It has to be new with some of the new technology inside.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_05
 And this is also more important than the last thing, which we may think that would have been the most important, which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control. So as you see, it first has to be very nice, something that people are proud of that it can be identified with.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_05
 And then, something that contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends, my mind has this and not yours.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_05
 And finally, of course, it has to be useful as a remote control, but it seems that it's not so important that it's used to this remote control.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_05
 Next slide, please.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_05
 Now, in a more general, broad way of seeing the thing, if we look back and not look at only remote controls, I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_05
 So currently, the trends that we see in big cities like Paris and Milan, well, it seems that this year things should have a fruit and vegetable way of the of lucar, fuel, so I think of course it applies to everything. That's the thing with trends.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_05
 It can travel from cloth to furniture, same idea, fruit and vegetable, think fruit and vegetable.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_05
 And if we compare to last year, now it has to be spongy.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_05
 Well, so I think when we were talking about rubber, I think the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe titanium is not a good idea.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_00
 Seems not. We need to think about, yeah.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry Mark.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_05
 Think more of something in the colors of fruits and vegetables and spongy.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_05
 Even in the shape.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_05
 Even in the shape, it has to be more round and more look natural somehow.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_05
 And not those futuristic remote controls with angles and titanium like.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_05
 So that's what people seem to do.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_05
 I know it's quite far from what you thought but that's fashion man.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, that's all I had to say.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_02
 Do you have questions?

0:24:49	SPEAKER_00
 So these updates are merely addressed by people or it's...

0:24:56	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sorry.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_00
 You got some update, fashion updates.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, we have people listening to the trends everywhere in the world of course.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_05
 Our company is quite big and so I'm just asking them whether the current trends are according to them when they go in the stores, when they ask their friends that are also...

0:25:19	SPEAKER_00
 It's more general trend, it's not particular to the more...

0:25:22	SPEAKER_05
 No, it's not this, this is very general.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_05
 But it seems that trends travel across things.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but some materials there to be...

0:25:35	SPEAKER_00
 There to be something like solid, they can't be really respond to you.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_05
 I think we have to have the look of the vegetables.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, at least that's...

0:25:44	SPEAKER_05
 We still have to put our chips inside.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_05
 So of course, this is your problem.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_05
 This is not mine.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, looking through these teams can be easily incorporated.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think in the colors or the kind of...

0:25:59	SPEAKER_05
 If it's something like rubber made or...

0:26:03	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I think it's also going to be good.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_02
 Another question?

0:26:13	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, thanks.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so we will have next meeting in 30 minutes again.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_02
 And now you have to concentrate on this individual action, which is...

0:26:40	SPEAKER_02
 Which are for Rama...

0:26:43	SPEAKER_00
 You can fill the...

0:26:44	SPEAKER_02
 Design, Mark, the user interface design, and Sami, the product evaluation.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_02
 You will work together on a new, on a prototype using Modelling Clay.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_00
 Sounds interesting.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_02
 And I, as always, your personal coach will send you a specific instruction.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_00
 Thanks.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_00
 So can we highlight the specific features of all the...

0:27:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you're right.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_00
 You have to.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_00
 So we want the speech recognition and we want some kind of buttons and we want some teams like fruits or vegetables.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_00
 We also follow the general trend, spongy.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_02
 Do we agree on that?

0:27:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_02
 We have to.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_04
 So do you think...

0:27:47	SPEAKER_04
 So we have to...

0:27:48	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, no, we don't have to.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_05
 Seems it's the trend.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_05
 Again, as I said, we can also try to make it.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_05
 Yes, so we hear the trend.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_04
 So there's no...

0:27:57	SPEAKER_04
 Are we confident enough on creating trends?

0:27:59	SPEAKER_05
 Well, that's you can try to convince us.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_04
 Wow.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_04
 We can make it smell like fruit.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, that's good idea.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_02
 So titanium smells like fruits.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_00
 So what about location and these people are really interesting on those features?

0:28:21	SPEAKER_00
 Or they really...

0:28:22	SPEAKER_00
 Like...

0:28:25	SPEAKER_00
 There are more...

0:28:26	SPEAKER_00
 One of these fancy features.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it's again in this...

0:28:31	SPEAKER_05
 In what I said, first it has to be fancy.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_05
 So I think if nobody else provides currently remote control, that kind of feature.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_05
 And if we can provide it, I think it's a good sell for us.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_05
 Because we have it on other stones.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_05
 It's fancy.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_05
 Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_02
 I agree with you.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_02
 Is this it?

0:28:56	SPEAKER_02
 Now we have to decide on what kind of fancy this.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_02
 Do we take titanium smelling like fruit?

0:29:02	SPEAKER_02
 Or do we make spongy, fruity like?

0:29:06	SPEAKER_00
 We will try to explore these two up.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can explore them too.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_04
 Could we make a titanium shape?

0:29:13	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, yeah, at least we're looking for a panel.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_02
 Don't you say that you cannot do double shaped...

0:29:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's a curved shape.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, let's say we have to look for alternatives and...

0:29:28	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, okay.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_00
 We have to see whether rubber is expensive and...

0:29:33	SPEAKER_04
 In fact, I just agree to make...

0:29:36	SPEAKER_04
 To make like, to tan your panels...

0:29:39	SPEAKER_04
 On a whole rubber body.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_04
 Well, okay.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so you explore now that you're going to work together...

0:29:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_02
 These two...

0:29:52	SPEAKER_02
 Or spongy and...

0:29:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can have two different decasembley, also like one spongy and one kind of titanium.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_00
 But instead, we have only the plastic or that...

0:30:05	SPEAKER_00
 Of course, you have some.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, fiber, chips or...

0:30:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't think...

0:30:09	SPEAKER_02
 I think we have to choose...

0:30:11	SPEAKER_02
 If we choose titanium or if we choose spongy, but it cannot be...

0:30:15	SPEAKER_04
 I really don't like this model in clay, because you know, it makes some rounds for...

0:30:20	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_04
 For creation.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, look.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you can't really...

0:30:27	SPEAKER_02
 You can't really say...

0:30:28	SPEAKER_02
 It's titanium.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_05
 You can paint it after work.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, we have a very large department of...

0:30:37	SPEAKER_02
 But don't worry, you...

0:30:39	SPEAKER_02
 You will do it.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_02
 You speak with...

0:30:41	SPEAKER_04
 All right, all right.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_02
 So, explore a shape.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_00
 So, still we want to keep LCD or...

0:30:55	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's what we say that we have a new CD with information.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_02
 How?

0:31:00	SPEAKER_05
 The thing is that if we want to have...

0:31:02	SPEAKER_05
 As he says, if we want to have a...

0:31:04	SPEAKER_05
 A small number of buttons, Yeah, then we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that user friendly.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_05
 That's the converse to having the zillions of buttons where each button does only one thing.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_00
 And we just stick with two batteries, so it's not any...

0:31:27	SPEAKER_00
 So, we stick on it.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_00
 Classic, we stick classic on it.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, we don't reinvent the wheels.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_05
 Anyway, it's very...

0:31:35	SPEAKER_05
 In general, I think people change TV more often than batteries of their remote control.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_05
 Oh.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_05
 Because the trend goes faster than the life of the...

0:31:53	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_02
 How are we?

0:31:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we're done.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_00
 We're done.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so see you in 30 minutes.

0:32:27	None
 Yeah.
