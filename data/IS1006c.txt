0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 So now we are in the conceptual design meeting.

0:00:29	SPEAKER_02
 It's been close to last.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_02
 It's the penalty meeting.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_04
 How was lunch?

0:00:37	SPEAKER_04
 Great!

0:00:38	SPEAKER_04
 Thanks!

0:00:39	SPEAKER_05
 Don't be sarcastic!

0:00:44	SPEAKER_03
 Spark!

0:00:48	SPEAKER_02
 So, I will again go to the secretary part.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_02
 We will have a presentation first.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_02
 We will have a design, then mark, and then Sami.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_02
 We have to take a decision on remote control concepts.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_02
 We have 40 minutes.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_02
 So, what we want to take on this meeting are on the first component concept.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_02
 So, what kind of energy we use, what kind of chip on print, and what kind of case, and also on user interface concept, what kind of interface we use, and if there is some supplements.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_02
 At the end, Sami will give a trend watching what is being doing.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_02
 So, let's go.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_02
 First, what is it?

0:02:00	SPEAKER_02
 Ramana.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_00
 Two.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but it's different.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_00
 Component?

0:02:15	SPEAKER_00
 So, we have to mainly design, mainly need to know which components we will use for energy and the material and the interface.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_00
 For energy, there are maybe two or three possibilities.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_00
 First, one, we can use simple battery, or we can use traditional solar cells, and then material, we can have plastic, rubber, which is good for this RSI.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_00
 And then a titanium, which can be, which have very good look.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_00
 And then interface, we have to use push buttons or liquid crystal LCD display, and we can use some jacks, moving jacks kind of thing.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_00
 So, as we discussed before, we would like to have some feature recognition chip in our remote control.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_00
 So, this can be simple kind of programmable chip, which can use microphone as well as some sound sensors.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_00
 And we also want to locate our remote control.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_00
 So, still we are looking for possible technical specifications and how easy we can do and within our range, like we have to do in our 12 euros or around that.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_00
 So, we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in house.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_00
 So, if we discussed and, excuse me, so we would like to propose better instead of solar cells and it would be problematic to have enough energy with solar cells and so we would like to just use simple battery.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_00
 And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or hand.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_00
 But the problem is with this design, we found that we can't use double curved shapes.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_00
 What is a double curved shape?

0:04:54	SPEAKER_00
 Like you can have two curves.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_00
 Aha, wow.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_00
 It's, I think in manufacturing, I guess it's problematic.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_00
 So, we want to go for simple push buttons because it needs simple chip and it's really less expensive compared to LCD, which need advanced chip technology and it's more expensive.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_00
 Since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition, we want to reduce the process.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_02
 I want to know why, just to, sorry, for the point before, why not the rubber?

0:05:38	SPEAKER_02
 It is something that it seems to be...

0:05:41	SPEAKER_00
 And also in if you put a bird, it's a bit difficult to do all the molding of buttons and these things.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_02
 And you, titanium, it's more...

0:05:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_04
 What can you use something like, you know, the whole body's titanium, but there are some rubber, you know, some rubber parts like...

0:06:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_00
 To make it feel better.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_00
 Like in cell phones recently, you can move with the rubber in four directions.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_00
 But full assembly, we will use mainly for titanium.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_00
 Rubber is expensive.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_00
 And also it's a bit difficult to do all the shit.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_00
 And this push button, we would like to use push button since LCD is in.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_00
 So we want to move...

0:06:34	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, we want to put speech recognition, so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_02
 So we have a simple button and speech recognition for the more complicated.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_00
 We have simple buttons and speech recognition technology.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_04
 And still we have...

0:06:57	SPEAKER_04
 Can we still include the LCD display?

0:07:00	SPEAKER_04
 LCD.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_04
 LCD, yeah.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_04
 It seems not.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_04
 It's either.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_04
 So it's like...

0:07:05	SPEAKER_04
 It's not going to be, you know, touchable, but still like a source of information or a source for many use.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe, maybe we can see depending on how we will come up with our full design then if you have enough money or like...

0:07:19	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_00
 So that's not enough.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_00
 Because speech recognition technology will take at least five euros or batchy or something.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_00
 So we want to reduce the cost on display or this...

0:07:30	SPEAKER_05
 The display would only be display and not...

0:07:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_04
 That's what it's going to be.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_04
 It's not going to be a touch spot.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_04
 Just display for giving you information.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. That can be we can consider because like it won't take much money.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:07:45	None
 Okay.

0:07:46	None
 Yeah.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_00
 Do you have any further questions?

0:07:54	SPEAKER_05
 I guess no.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_05
 So the batteries are going to be very light.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_00
 We have to go for...

0:08:03	SPEAKER_00
 And now I think we have many options in the market.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_00
 So we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries for really light batteries and with good price.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_05
 So this device that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for this finding it basically instead of clapping wide.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_00
 Just the...

0:08:30	SPEAKER_00
 The one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in household.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_00
 So it will be...

0:08:39	SPEAKER_00
 It may be at least five, six people want to use it.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_00
 So how to define our speech recognition whether we want to do speaker independent or speaker dependent.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_00
 If you're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_00
 It would be really more technology.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_00
 For the location.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_00
 If everybody in the house they want to look at them where to go for some speaker independent technology.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_02
 So it's now good to do.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_02
 You do have a question.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_02
 No, it's a no more question.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_05
 Thank you.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_05
 But it's less of a constraint on what we can do.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_05
 It's always like that.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_05
 We have dreams and in the end we find out that it's not feasible.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_00
 We have some limitations on this.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_04
 LST is already quite nice.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_04
 LST is something else.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_04
 It's quite nice.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_05
 I'm an artist.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_03
 So good.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_02
 That's not the impression.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_04
 No, let's talk about the interface.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_04
 This is about number three.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_04
 The...

0:09:59	SPEAKER_04
 Which one?

0:10:00	SPEAKER_04
 Hmm.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_04
 Hmm.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_04
 Hmm.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, look at this.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_04
 And five.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_04
 So the concept of the interface.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_04
 Generally I developed quite a broad concept.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_04
 Not only for the interface but for possible instruction or use of the interface.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_04
 Or use of manual and all the complex things that come together with your TV and remote controls.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_04
 So let's start with this.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_04
 We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_04
 And we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and it will take some days to learn all these buttons.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_04
 And the LCD is going to be somewhere here.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_04
 And go back button.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know really where it is.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe one of these buttons.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_04
 And power on and off.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_04
 I don't remember.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_04
 So it should be...

0:11:09	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe this button is power on and off or no info.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_04
 I can see nothing.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_04
 So that's our concept.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_04
 It's called the Millennium Remote Control.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_05
 Let's change millenials.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe you can use for those in the audience.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, that doesn't make sense.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_05
 This is very...

0:11:30	SPEAKER_04
 Really?

0:11:31	SPEAKER_04
 I'll touch your knackers.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, I don't know.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, just press the button.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, no.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_04
 We will not use this.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_04
 We will not use this.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_04
 Instead of this ugly device, that's our concept.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_04
 And it's got just few buttons quite well looking and all this stuff we already...

0:11:58	SPEAKER_04
 We already discussed.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_04
 And what will people say?

0:12:04	SPEAKER_04
 They will say it's perfect.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_04
 Or what will say?

0:12:09	SPEAKER_04
 They will say it's blended.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_04
 Everyone will say I'll buy it.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_04
 And everyone's going to be satisfied.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_05
 Do you think it can come in several colors?

0:12:24	SPEAKER_04
 Or did I would make a backlight of the LCD screen with different colors?

0:12:31	SPEAKER_04
 But not the case.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_04
 Not the case.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_05
 The case would only be in that aluminium titanium stuff.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_02
 Because apparently from your survey people like color.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, they like something which is...

0:12:48	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, okay.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_05
 So that would be the option.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_05
 I don't have a Nokia phone.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_05
 But it's...

0:12:59	SPEAKER_00
 I don't use that, but again...

0:13:00	SPEAKER_04
 That's why you don't have it.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_03
 That's why.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_00
 Of course it's nasty.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_00
 But it would be expensive.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 Now if you use color LCD...

0:13:11	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_00
 Instead of that, maybe we can change the color of the assembly.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can just...

0:13:20	SPEAKER_00
 If you just want more colors they can pay more money to get this...

0:13:25	SPEAKER_00
 Oh.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_00
 The shapes.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_00
 I mean they can have different assembly vibe here.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_00
 So users have different...

0:13:35	SPEAKER_00
 They have their own color interest and so on.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_00
 So if they want they can just pay another...

0:13:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so you propose something with option...

0:13:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_02
 That increase the price if we...

0:13:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_00
 If they want like...

0:13:51	SPEAKER_00
 Of course, kind of...

0:13:52	SPEAKER_00
 Upgradable...

0:13:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_05
 Remote control.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_00
 Just they will get a few more things and a few more colors.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_04
 But there is one more solution.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_04
 Because there are some paints that can change color according to where they are.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_04
 Like they can reflect different colors.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_02
 And depending on what is around.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_02
 Like what color is around.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_04
 And depending on the temperature.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_04
 Kind of a good effect.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but that may be too much expensive.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_02
 But it can be in maybe in an upgradeable version.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_05
 Because I think there are two kinds of people.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_05
 Those for which the remote control is to be something useful.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_05
 I am going to talk about this later.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_05
 And those for which it's something that is specific to them.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_05
 So it's like a signature.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_05
 My remote control is pink.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_05
 Nobody else than me has a pink remote control.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_05
 And that makes me special.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_02
 And you seem that we don't have to make them pay more.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_05
 I think they would be ready to pay more for that.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_05
 So those who wanted to have it be.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_02
 So it's not a base service.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_04
 Not an option.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_04
 Might be optional.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_00
 But those people will be really few.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_05
 The young people want to be different from their friends.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_05
 Although similar, but have something just slightly better.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_05
 Pink.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe that if that is a selling point.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe it has to be the base.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_04
 But you know if you want to be different.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_04
 You just take your remote control with you all the time.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_04
 And it's based on different.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_03
 You know?

0:15:48	SPEAKER_04
 And you want to pass the remote controls here.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 You don't have to say hello.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_05
 You know, for instance, take the iPod.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_05
 It's a kind of remote control.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_05
 It's white.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_05
 And it's so white that you see it from anywhere.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_05
 It has this distinctive look and feel and look video.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_05
 Which people seem to like.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_05
 Just because it's a color that we don't usually see in a remote control.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_05
 White.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_04
 Could we integrate something into our remote control?

0:16:21	SPEAKER_04
 Something like light.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_04
 That I can use it in darkness.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, the dark.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe like the infrared.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_00
 Like we can put some radium chips or something.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_00
 So that like at least some.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_00
 Enredium?

0:16:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_03
 I'll work with you, Enium.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_00
 This is radium.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_02
 So.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_04
 Well, let's go on maybe with the presentation.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_04
 Sure.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_04
 And the remote control is going to be smart.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_04
 But how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_04
 And I don't know.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_04
 That's a question to you.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_05
 Well, so I heard that it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_05
 So that's the smartness of the thing currently.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_05
 We don't have guns with speech recognition or beer cans with speech recognition.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_05
 But we may have remote controls with speech recognition.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_04
 That's a nice one.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_04
 Just take a bite.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_05
 Don't touch the room.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_05
 Thank you.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_05
 But yeah.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_05
 Are you saying here that the remote control should be aware of who's using it?

0:17:46	SPEAKER_05
 So for instance, the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_05
 I just want to say it should be a fingerprint recognition.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_04
 The worst recognition is quite enough.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_04
 I say don't use it and the control just locks.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_04
 Because I ordered.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_00
 Just that could be feasible like this.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_00
 So since we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition also.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_05
 So it could be smart in that way.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_05
 But for instance, I'm thinking about the other.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_05
 Particularity that the remote control could have since it knows who is using it.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_05
 It might also record the kind of channels you are more often using.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_05
 Levels of volumes that you're more often.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_05
 You know, some things like that and provide you ways of using them.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_05
 That might be expensive.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_05
 But that might also be a good sales speech again.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_05
 The remote that knows you.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:19:08	None
 Thanks.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 So.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_02
 My turn.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_02
 Marketing expert.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_05
 Sorry.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_02
 But spent four I think.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_05
 Trend.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_05
 So I'm going to talk about trends.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_05
 And then I hope this can help us to understand how we should design our remote control.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_05
 So next slide please.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_05
 So first maybe just a small recap on how do we watch trends.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_05
 So it's not so simple.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_05
 You might think that it's easy but it's not so simple.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_05
 Anyway, these days the best source of information is the web as you know.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_05
 So have to go often on the web and look at what the others are doing.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_05
 And ask real people who are using real remote controls every day.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_05
 Or any other tool that is similar to a remote control, which basically is a small device that people may have with them.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_05
 Always like a phone.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_05
 We can use the phone as a good example of where to be inspired.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_05
 Of course those who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact they are not only watching the trends.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_05
 They are inventing it.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_05
 They are creating the trend.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_05
 I hope I'm going to try to help you on that.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_05
 This is more risky because you are not following the trend you try to invent it.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_05
 Which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you are out of business.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_05
 So anyway, next slide please.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_05
 To be quick.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_05
 There are a lot of words here but basically they are in the market of remote controls.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_05
 There are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_05
 The first one which seems to be the most important one is that it has to be fancy.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_05
 It has to have a fancy look and feel.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_05
 Interestingly this is the very most important thing.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_05
 It has to be fancy.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_05
 Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be with and now that's the second thing it has to be.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_05
 It has to be technologically innovative.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_05
 It has to be new with some of new technology inside.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_05
 This is also more important than the last thing which we may think would have been the most important.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_05
 It should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_05
 As you see it first has to be very nice.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_05
 People are proud of.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_05
 They can be identified with and then something that contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_05
 Mine has this and not yours.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_05
 And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_05
 But it seems that it's not so important that it's used to this remote control.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_05
 Next slide please.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_05
 Now in a more general broad way of seeing the thing.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_05
 If we look back and not look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_05
 So currently the trends that we see in big cities like Paris and Milan.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_05
 Well it seems that this year things should have a fruit and vegetable way of Luca feel.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_05
 And I think of course it applies to everything that's the thing with trends.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_05
 It can travel from cloth to furniture.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_05
 Same idea fruit and vegetable.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_05
 And if we compare to last year now it has to be spongy.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_05
 So I think when we were talking about rubber I think the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is pretty more visible in terms of sponginess.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe Titanyam is not a good idea.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_00
 Seems not.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_00
 We need to think about...

0:24:00	SPEAKER_05
 I'm sorry Mark.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_05
 I think more of something in the colors of fruits and vegetables and spongy.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_05
 Even in the shape it has to be more round and more colorful.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_05
 It looks natural somehow.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_05
 And not those futuristic remote controls with angles and Titanyam like.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_05
 So that's what people seem to...

0:24:34	SPEAKER_02
 All fashion.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_05
 Quite far from what you thought but that's fashion man.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_05
 Okay that's all I have to say.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_00
 So these update is mainly addressed by people or...

0:24:56	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sorry.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_00
 You got some update, fashion updates.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah we have people listening to the trends everywhere in the world of course.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_05
 Our company is quite big.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_05
 It's not fun.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's more general trend.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_00
 It's more general trend.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_00
 It's not particular to remote controls.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_05
 No it's not.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_05
 This is very general.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_05
 But it seems that trends travel across things.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah but some materials there to be something like solid.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_00
 We can't build this conduit.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_05
 I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah at least I...

0:25:43	SPEAKER_05
 But we still have to put our chips inside.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah of course.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_05
 This is your problem.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_05
 This is not mine.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah looking fruit.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_00
 These teams can be easily incorporated.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_00
 I think in the colors or the kind of material.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_05
 If it's something like rubber made or...

0:26:03	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah I think it's also going to be good.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_02
 One more question.

0:26:14	None
 Okay.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_03
 Thanks.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_02
 So we will have the next meeting in 30 minutes again.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_02
 And now you have to concentrate on this individual action which are for...

0:26:40	SPEAKER_02
 Rama...

0:26:41	SPEAKER_02
 You can feel it.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_02
 Design...

0:26:45	SPEAKER_02
 Mark the user interface design and Sami the product evaluation.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_02
 You will work together on a prototype using modeling clay.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_02
 Sounds interesting.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_02
 And I...

0:27:08	SPEAKER_02
 As always your personal coach will send you specific instruction.

0:27:13	None
 Okay.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_05
 Thanks.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_00
 So can we highlight the specific features of our...

0:27:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah you're right.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_00
 So we want the speech recognizer and we want...

0:27:28	SPEAKER_00
 Some kind of buttons and we want some teams like fruits or vegetables.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_00
 So you say...

0:27:36	SPEAKER_00
 We also follow the general trend.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_00
 Spongy.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_02
 Do we agree on that?

0:27:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_02
 You have to.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_04
 So do you think...

0:27:47	SPEAKER_04
 So we have to...

0:27:48	SPEAKER_05
 No we don't have to.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_05
 Seems it's the trend.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_05
 Again as I said we can also try to make it.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_04
 So we get the trend.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_04
 So there's no way confident enough in creating trends.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_05
 Well that's you can try to convince us.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_04
 Wow.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_04
 We can make it smell like fruit.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_02
 That's a good idea.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_02
 So titanium smell like fruits.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_00
 So what about location and these people are really interesting on those features or they really...

0:28:23	SPEAKER_00
 Like there are more on these fancy features.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's again in this...

0:28:30	SPEAKER_05
 What I said first it has to be fancy.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_05
 So I think if nobody else provides currently remote control with that kind of feature.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_05
 And if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_05
 Because we have it and others don't.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_05
 It's fancy.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_05
 Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_02
 I agree with this.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_02
 Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_02
 Do we take titanium smelling like fruit?

0:29:01	SPEAKER_02
 Or do we make spongy fruit like fruit?

0:29:05	SPEAKER_00
 We will try to explore these two options.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can explore the two options.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_04
 Could we make a titanium shape?

0:29:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah at least we can put fruit shapes.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_02
 But you say that you cannot do double shaped...

0:29:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah it beats.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah that's a way to look for alternatives and...

0:29:28	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_00
 We have to see whether rubber is expensive and...

0:29:32	SPEAKER_04
 In fact I just agreed to make titanium panels on a whole rubber body.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_04
 Well okay.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay so you explore now that you're going to work together.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_02
 These two are spongy and...

0:29:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can have two different disassembly.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_00
 Also like one spongy and one kind of titanium.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_00
 But since they're chips we have only the plastic or that...

0:30:04	SPEAKER_00
 Oh for the size.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah fiber chips or...

0:30:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah I don't think... I think we have to choose...

0:30:10	SPEAKER_02
 If we choose titanium or if we choose spongy but it cannot be both.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_04
 I really don't like this model in clay because you know it makes some balance for...

0:30:20	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_04
 For creation.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_04
 Oh look.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah you can't do the exact tenures.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_05
 You can paint it after work.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_05
 We have a very large department of...

0:30:35	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah don't worry.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_02
 You will do it.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_02
 You will do it.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_02
 You will do it.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_04
 Alright.

0:30:42	None
 Alright.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_02
 So explore a shape.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_00
 So still we want to keep LCD or...

0:30:54	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's what we say that we have a new CD with information.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_05
 The thing is that if we want to have as he says, if we want to have a small number of buttons...

0:31:05	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_05
 Then we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_00
 User friendly.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_05
 That's the converse to having the zillions of buttons where each button does only one thing.

0:31:20	None
 Yeah.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_00
 And we just stick with two batteries so it's not any...

0:31:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_00
 So we stick less time in that.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_05
 We don't reinvent the wheel.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_05
 Anyway it's very...

0:31:34	SPEAKER_05
 In general I think people change TV more often than batteries of their remote control.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_05
 So because the trend goes faster than the life of them.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_05
 So it's too low.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_02
 Now we...

0:31:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_00
 We're done.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_02
 We're done.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_02
 So see you in 30 minutes.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:32:10	None
 Okay.

0:32:18	None
 Okay.
