0:00:30	SPEAKER_03
 Pala runda...i was one of them

0:01:01	SPEAKER_04
 ok

0:01:03	SPEAKER_03
 c'mon check, check, check why won't it wake up is it done?

0:01:20	None
 ok power that doesn't work you turn it off

0:01:31	SPEAKER_03
 but how? no, there it is

0:01:36	SPEAKER_01
 ok

0:01:38	SPEAKER_02
 i received an email with a few possibilities on the materials so i will discuss them ok, we just need to go on to the back later

0:01:50	SPEAKER_03
 yeah, i received it so we are going to talk about the conceptual model which one was mine?

0:02:12	SPEAKER_01
 so that's me ok, so ok, so i will show you the the minute what's it called?

0:02:30	SPEAKER_01
 ok, so we just talked about the you want me to show it there?

0:02:54	SPEAKER_01
 no ok, we just talked about it looks it's a nice usability people don't want to spend money on something similar to cheaper ones it has to be very basic not too many buttons light switches on if you use a button text TV still has to be a possibility and it has to be easy to learn what are the things i make and the functions are full human channel to choose channels on the off mute button and the text TV button that are the functions that's right?

0:03:38	SPEAKER_01
 yes, that's ok so i just want to give you a mic again the first presentation of your

0:03:46	SPEAKER_04
 channel i start ok, well i received an email ok i search the web and i search on this document we sent investigation of the remote control market it has been done in italy and in another country in Europe i forget it but they found out the most important respect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look and feel instead of the current functional look and feel so it's very important for us to create something new so what michael just said it must be some very different from ordinary remote controls fancy stands for an original look and feel of the case and interface this aspect is the most important one it came out of the research and as the following the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological innovative and that stands for new technical features and then this is a point of discussion because we just decided that we don't make use of LCD or speech recognition but this is the second important aspect and i think we must use some of the new technology to be innovative

0:05:38	SPEAKER_01
 we already have the flashing light on it maybe some new

0:05:42	SPEAKER_04
 we have to discuss about it

0:05:44	SPEAKER_00
 okay

0:05:46	SPEAKER_04
 tell us which that do not exist in current remote controls and that's very hard i think the third one is the aspect that the remote controls should be easy to use but that was an overall point we already discussed that i've got one picture our target group we thought about was Jo and Trendy so i took that part of the webpage and it says fashion watches of very friends in it i have detected the following trends this trend i think it's not that meaningful for us maybe but it's about close and shoes but the next aspect also in contrast to last year the field of material is expected to be spongy spongy spongy

0:06:48	SPEAKER_02
 okay so rubber

0:06:52	SPEAKER_01
 soft material it's definitely a good idea because you drop your remote control very often on the ground so it has to be

0:07:00	SPEAKER_04
 flexible it's something that it's stand there i didn't knew what it means so spongy means like a sponge it's also a stress ball it's a good idea

0:07:14	SPEAKER_01
 it's like that it's the bit like the the borders of the remote control or soft

0:07:22	SPEAKER_02
 yeah i have some material information but i will give you it later okay in my presentation

0:07:28	SPEAKER_04
 okay what do i think because a fancy look is the most important thing for remote control i think about changeable fronts maybe i see through one in a fruit front because it's it's hot and some basic color fronts so we can make five different fronts to start with or something maybe an extraordinary shape like a sponge or yeah just another shape then a normal remote control has just something rounds in it or maybe not yeah i don't know we have to discuss about that yeah main point still the technological innovative how do we do that? maybe speech we must have some kind of gadget

0:08:24	SPEAKER_03
 yeah i'll get back on that

0:08:28	SPEAKER_01
 it's very difficult to do it because it's only 12.5 euros

0:08:34	SPEAKER_03
 you have to spend yeah that's the problem also an email from

0:08:40	SPEAKER_04
 the technology department

0:08:42	SPEAKER_03
 maybe watch the first even more possibilities now with speech so they recommend it using it

0:08:52	SPEAKER_04
 okay let's check what it first watch

0:08:58	SPEAKER_02
 we have don't have an idea how much it's gone

0:09:02	SPEAKER_03
 and cost maybe cheap and they don't say how much it's gone so if we implement its mass production i think it would be better to implement LCD as well since you have to configure

0:09:18	SPEAKER_01
 speech

0:09:20	SPEAKER_03
 that's definitely more expensive than

0:09:22	SPEAKER_04
 yeah that's something i don't know we're going to make many of those so we can start a mass production and then we still will be

0:09:32	SPEAKER_01
 but the telephones also have an LCD and it's about 200 euros

0:09:38	SPEAKER_00
 we have to decide

0:09:40	SPEAKER_04
 okay that was this

0:09:44	SPEAKER_03
 no

0:09:46	SPEAKER_02
 i got an email and it says the chip can be simple, regular, or advanced and they say a display requires an advanced chip and this is more expensive than all the other chips so

0:10:12	SPEAKER_03
 the most expensive

0:10:14	SPEAKER_02
 it says an email the display requires an advanced chip

0:10:18	SPEAKER_03
 and speech or good yes probably

0:10:22	SPEAKER_02
 i haven't got anything about speech recognition

0:10:26	SPEAKER_03
 but

0:10:28	SPEAKER_02
 that's the most expensive chip we need if we do

0:10:34	SPEAKER_03
 we can make a sort of a design so i did some searching on the internet what's the old remote control and new remote control i think we should this is one of the modern remote controls of the moment i think we should go more to the iPod and

0:11:10	SPEAKER_01
 amperee players

0:11:12	SPEAKER_03
 mobafon you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller because when you're going to control it you can see it here you have to be able to reach both sides and you just have one few buttons so that's the main difference i definitely think we should go like this and then change both so that's the most important part i think a bit on the home basis something like that something simple well and then i just ordered the buttons a bit basic buttons on off mute and maybe two others so i don't think i don't think it fits in the modern stream as well and then where you saw the display in the iPod you can put the basic buttons 1,2,3,4 and above 10 and i think on the display no no there's no display there but it's on the place of the display and i think we should light this up much more than that part so the focus is on these two parts so you don't see all the buttons you

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 else but this one is very difficult to use because the volume and channel is on the bottom so you can use your thumb for it this is how it is now

0:12:46	SPEAKER_03
 here well well it's volume i think it's on on the bottom

0:12:54	SPEAKER_02
 i think it's on on the bottom but it's not the best

0:12:58	SPEAKER_03
 well the yearly FL so side scrolls i don't know if you can use that yeah i've got something on that for volume or a channel well then we can even simplify it more by just putting the volume on the side and just channel buttons here

0:13:16	SPEAKER_02
 maybe the channel buttons are often used and you can use them now with your thumb because the thing is not well easy to use

0:13:26	SPEAKER_03
 well control basically as

0:13:30	SPEAKER_02
 here maybe we should put that on top

0:13:36	SPEAKER_01
 but as we don't use on any buttons just put that on the bottom

0:13:42	SPEAKER_02
 because you can't hold it

0:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 you can't hold it and push the buttons

0:13:50	SPEAKER_03
 okay well yeah

0:13:52	SPEAKER_02
 well i think you use the switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons like one, two, three so maybe we can put that on the bottom

0:14:04	SPEAKER_03
 maybe i don't know well

0:14:08	SPEAKER_02
 like zapping is just switch

0:14:12	SPEAKER_03
 maybe it's not easy if it's below it's harder to zep so i think it should be to be easy to help i think it's pretty standard these row buttons on the top if you don't light them up you don't seem very good i think it's modern to light this area up and to light this area up so the focus gets on this part and not on there okay but the position of course can be different we have to look at what's easy to use so we can switch these to i don't know if it will look good if you put those on the bottom

0:14:56	SPEAKER_02
 no i think the top buttons are okay they should be on top

0:15:02	SPEAKER_03
 maybe we can switch those and you have to make sure it's easy to test to be big enough so you can heal well that's my findings so my personal opinions that we should go more modern look and play and well if you want to put in speak recognition or something i don't think we should put it on top then i think that if you're going to put in more technology you need to be able to switch it open to use so if you put in speech recognition you need so many more buttons which won't look good on the front side i think no so that's something we have to decide

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 yeah we have to keep it simple

0:15:52	SPEAKER_01
 yeah we have to decide this lecture or this i think we have to do it for 20 minutes

0:16:14	None
 yeah i think we're just going to look okay the component design

0:16:20	None
 i looked at some similar devices and my own common knowledge so this was on the website if you aim at a young public you should use materials in our soft with primary colors like green, blue, red so fleshy kind of colors shapes should be curved so round shapes nothing square like okay so okay

0:16:52	SPEAKER_01
 your iPod is trendy

0:16:54	SPEAKER_03
 it is no curved square yeah but it has round corners

0:17:00	SPEAKER_02
 i think so we shouldn't have two square corners in that class yeah

0:17:08	SPEAKER_03
 and

0:17:10	SPEAKER_02
 sports and gaming divine style characteristics i don't know exactly what that means it should be well yeah popular kind of

0:17:24	SPEAKER_01
 yeah we have to put our real reaction logo as well on the remote control so the colors also we have the hate make it in black black yellow

0:17:36	SPEAKER_02
 black yellow

0:17:38	SPEAKER_01
 maybe the size yellow and the top black

0:17:40	SPEAKER_02
 not that weird because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy to attract a young public

0:17:48	SPEAKER_03
 yeah but i don't think the colors black and yellow go well together no

0:17:54	SPEAKER_01
 maybe that's a yellow on the side and black on the front

0:17:58	SPEAKER_02
 that's just a matter of taste yeah okay we have to use kind of fleshy colors

0:18:04	SPEAKER_03
 we can't use different fronts with all with the logo on it yeah we do that

0:18:12	SPEAKER_02
 like front in red and yellow

0:18:14	SPEAKER_01
 blue and so it's still transparent

0:18:16	SPEAKER_03
 yeah but with all with logo on it

0:18:20	SPEAKER_02
 well this is a remote control a very old one and then the components the case just the here's black

0:18:34	SPEAKER_01
 maybe we have to make it from soft material yeah i don't know

0:18:38	SPEAKER_02
 maybe but anyways it should be transparent we decided that

0:18:46	SPEAKER_03
 well one of the options you can just like a mobile phone you can make a okay yeah we could do that

0:18:58	SPEAKER_01
 or just give five with them

0:19:02	SPEAKER_03
 just in the box

0:19:04	SPEAKER_02
 yeah you could make them like blue and transparent with the buttons normal rubber i think like normal ordinary buttons

0:19:18	SPEAKER_01
 soft it could be like a Nokia

0:19:22	SPEAKER_03
 with a hard hard button rubber really has an old look

0:19:26	SPEAKER_04
 okay the new modern remote controls the buttons are part of the style i think it's part of the remote control itself questsken en ser gyareduna onwon qué Swirl

0:19:59	SPEAKER_02
 so in one level

0:20:02	SPEAKER_03
 the topics

0:20:05	SPEAKER_02
 yeah – OK, so that should be hard plastic than the buttons?

0:20:12	SPEAKER_03
 – I think or maybe… – I may be able to kind of material with this, but…

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 – Yeah. – Maybe you can make it around platform soft material, just only the basic remote control from normal plastic and the rounds of it from softers.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_02
 – OK. – Yeah. – And then the LED, the normal infrared LED, I think, sufficient and backlight LEDs. – Cool. – But I think we have to make the case transparent, otherwise the backlight won't work.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_02
 – So if you put… – Yeah, you can use… – The number of the buttons. – Yeah, that's right.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_02
 – Or it runs the whole… – Yeah, but we can still make it transparent.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_03
 – So, hey, can you turn it on? – Half transparent or just that it comes out a bit?

0:21:04	SPEAKER_02
 – OK. And in green color, the backlight or difference? – I think also.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_03
 – Yeah. – Blue. – Blue, red, whatever you want, I think, depends on the color.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_01
 – Yeah, but you can't choose when you buy it. – Yeah, that's true.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_02
 – Now, I think there are multiple color LEDs. So… – Yeah, but can you change the filter? – I know, I know.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_03
 – I think it's more important to control it. – Yeah, OK. Maybe it's more important.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_02
 – It's more expensive. – I think it's better to say that.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_03
 – I have a blinking light on my phone and I can change the color of it.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_01
 – OK, cool. Just make it some different colors, blue, red and green.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_02
 – Yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's too expensive, but… – Well, I don't think so.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_03
 – I put in any fancy technology yet.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_02
 – Then some more technical things. I don't know what it is, but it should be there, I think.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_02
 This is normal circuit board, like chip boards in a lot of things.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_02
 – You have to hurry up a bit. – So we just need this and… – This transistors and resonators, this is all these kind of things.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_02
 They basically said that that's almost the same on any remote control.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_02
 So I guess we just need that. I don't know what they do.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_04
 – OK, you can change. – Yeah.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_02
 – Now, they just said we need it.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_02
 The battery contacts, like normal batteries.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_01
 – You can pick up a recharge, maybe. – Yeah, we still want to have a recharge, don't we?

0:22:40	SPEAKER_02
 – Yeah, but we don't want to have a… how do you call it?

0:22:45	SPEAKER_02
 – Akku. – Recharge.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_02
 – Just batteries. – Rechargeable batteries.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_03
 – Rechargeable batteries. – OK.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_02
 – Not a separate… – No, just rechargeable batteries.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_02
 – And a chip, that's this one.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_02
 – I received some possibilities for the energy source.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_02
 We can use batteries or a kinetic, like with the pulse watch.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_02
 So it operates on your wrist.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_02
 – OK. So if you want to… – Normally you put a remote control on the table or on the floor.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_02
 – Yeah, I don't think it will work. And we can also use solar cells, but you mostly use it indoors.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_02
 – This battery, that's cheaper. – Yeah, and we can use the home station kind of thing.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_02
 – In cases, flat, so uncurved. 2D curved is like front to the back.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_02
 And 3D curved is also in depth. – OK.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_02
 – So that's possible. But with 3D curved, we must control, we must use rubber buttons.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_02
 So we can use the flat. – So we need 2D.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_02
 – Yeah, I think. – Definitely. – These kind of materials can be used?

0:24:03	SPEAKER_01
 – It doesn't really matter, we just make it plastic. – Yeah.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_01
 – I think so too. – Scroll wheels, that's cool, that's for the volume.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_02
 – Yeah, scroll wheels. – Yeah.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_02
 – Yeah, that's good.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_02
 – We can use multiple scroll wheels, too, if we want to, but I think just the volume is enough.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_03
 – I think for channels, it's not handy. – OK.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_02
 – Scroll, fast. – And the LCD. So we need the most expensive chip if we use an LCD.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_01
 – I don't think that's an opportunity. Just skip it, because we don't have time for that, too.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_02
 – OK, then we use the second most expensive chips, so the regular chip, because we use scroll wheels.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_02
 – Yeah. – OK.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_02
 – And, yeah, that was it. – OK.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_02
 – Are we using a rubber case or a side? – Maybe we have to skip that one as well, please.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_03
 – I don't think it will be okay. – It should be soft.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_04
 – It should be soft. – The trend is spongy and fruit or fresh.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_04
 – Fresh. – And now we have nothing about those toes, too.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_03
 – Fruit and fresh can be just the covers. – Yeah, just soft-flying the spongy.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_03
 – Yeah, I don't know. I can't imagine. – No.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_03
 – I don't like it to the neuter. – No. I just can't imagine.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_02
 – So just hard plastic? – Yeah.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_03
 – Titanium. It's mentioned there. – Titanium, I think, is too expensive.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_01
 – Maybe the form has to be a bit different. Not the square form, just a bit.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_02
 – Yeah, you can make it curved or round. – Or round.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_02
 – But just in 2D, nothing depth. – Yeah, it's OK.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_01
 So, if I have to decide which one to choose from these, what exactly?

0:26:05	SPEAKER_01
 Because we have to know it. So the energy is 3 charge, if you already know that.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_01
 – Yeah, that's right. – It's normal, that's free.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_01
 – The chip on print is a normal one. – Yeah, the case is just a plastic one.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_02
 – Yeah, the chip is the regular one. – Yeah, it's a simple one, regular and as fun.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_02
 So it should be regular in this second.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_01
 – I think I'll just check this. – And we need a plastic case with a scroll wheel.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_01
 – I don't know, at least. – Yes.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_01
 – That's pretty much it. – Yeah.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_01
 – And the last thing. – And the last thing. – And the last thing.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_01
 So, I'm not sure, but I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_02
 – I don't know what I do. – Or should we do it in the next meeting?

0:26:57	SPEAKER_03
 – ID and UID work together on prototype drawing on smart boards.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_03
 – Yeah, so we should get it here. – So we're staying here?

0:27:05	SPEAKER_01
 – Sure, we're doing it in the next meeting. – I think that's the next meeting.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_01
 – But you definitely get a specific instruction. – Okay, so I don't work for the minutes alone again.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_01
 – But think about something that's more rounded and more... – Yeah, I didn't know, but iPod and etc.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_01
 – And body prayer is mobile phones. – I bet just on the top floor.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_03
 – This is a bit of a current man, okay. I'll see if I can see any events.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_01
 – Maybe you can be like this, if you draw it like this.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_01
 – Get it. – What the fuck is he?

0:27:43	SPEAKER_01
 – Okay. Doesn't work. – You see what I mean?

0:27:51	SPEAKER_01
 – If I draw here, what? – It draws about four centimeters over the neck.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_01
 – Maybe you can make it like this.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_01
 – And this is all the wheel for a volume, so that you just...

0:28:11	SPEAKER_01
 – Just all round it, so you can do... – Like a very big scroll wheel.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_01
 – Yeah, but just not on the top, but on the side of it. – Okay.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_01
 – Maybe. I don't know. – Hmm.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_01
 – Okay, so we just... – I have this at the moment.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_02
 – I think you'll get a lot of volume changing when it's not wanted. – Yeah.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_01
 – Okay, so we do have this. Is it okay? – Yeah.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_00
 – I think it's probably better. – Probably better.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_02
 – Yeah, but maybe we can make a plastic so that if you drop it, you won't change a volume.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_03
 – Yeah, I know if you use something. – If you use something...

0:28:48	SPEAKER_03
 – That's not square, but it's very easy.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_01
 – Like this, and what's the channel to? Where do we put that?

0:28:54	SPEAKER_01
 – I think in the middle. – The bottom, or?

0:28:56	SPEAKER_03
 – Yeah, what is the middle part? – That's the numbers.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_02
 – I think the numbers should be in the bottom, and the switch channel in the middle.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_02
 – Yeah, I agree as well.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_01
 – It doesn't make a difference if you put the switch channels on the side of each other, on the top of each other, because you already have the volume here.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_01
 So you can also put it here, one but and the other one there.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_01
 Next to each other.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_01
 – Yeah, that's right. So you can also put it all on the top and this, keep this empty, because you have to hold it as well.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_02
 – Or you could do the switch channel up button above the numbers,

0:29:32	SPEAKER_01
 and switch channel down button below. – It doesn't need you to set it very quick.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_03
 – I think it's the highest priority, and then you use those...

0:29:40	SPEAKER_01
 – Is this an opportunity, or are you doing one thing?

0:29:42	SPEAKER_02
 – Yeah, of course, sir. – I think we should put them on top of each other, so...

0:29:48	SPEAKER_02
 – Yeah, because then it's easy to know if I push the...

0:29:53	SPEAKER_01
 – But still the next one.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_02
 – Yeah, but the top button is...

0:29:58	SPEAKER_02
 is like you switch channel up, and down button is...

0:30:01	SPEAKER_01
 – Yeah, but if you put them...

0:30:02	SPEAKER_02
 – On the left, the right is exactly the same, but it doesn't make a big difference.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_02
 – Yeah, I think it's...

0:30:07	SPEAKER_02
 But I think left to right is more often associated with volume, and top down is more with channel change.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_02
 – But it's almost remote controls.

 No, it's not something...

0:31:57	SPEAKER_01
...or it's something...

0:31:58	SPEAKER_01
...so you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger...

0:32:01	SPEAKER_01
...is that a good opportunity?

0:32:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, so I put it like that.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, you let it slide in the docking station.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_02
 Do we have to design that as well?

0:32:13	SPEAKER_02
 The docking station?

0:32:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think so.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we can do that.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that can be very simple.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_04
 It could be just a recharger.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_03
 Just where?

0:32:28	SPEAKER_03
 Just a second.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_03
 You're around something.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we had one example.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_02
 But do we have to make contacts on the remote control and the recharging as well?

0:32:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but that's a round one.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we can choose then.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_03
 Here you just see one.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_03
 That's very round.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_03
 So I think that can be all kind of shapes.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_01
 But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_02
 Off the remote control?

0:33:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_03
 So you don't want this...

0:33:09	SPEAKER_03
...like the iPod and Phil's, but...

0:33:12	SPEAKER_03
...and the other one.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think it will just look like...

0:33:19	SPEAKER_03
...more like this one, since this is also rounded.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_03
 No, just the corners.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, those are already a bit corners.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but we can do all kinds of...

0:33:30	SPEAKER_02
...as long as it is in 2D, we can use all kind of round shapes.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but then we have to...

0:33:39	SPEAKER_02
...yeah, but if we want to make it kind of...

0:33:44	SPEAKER_03
...yeah, new...

0:33:46	SPEAKER_03
 I've had a lot of pictures of old ones and all curves have already been done.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_01
 It's a bit annoying, is it?

0:33:59	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_04
 What do we do round?

0:34:03	SPEAKER_04
 Just more like this and not...

0:34:06	SPEAKER_04
...that's quite...

0:34:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, well...

0:34:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but we could do a lot more curving.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_03
 Like we do with...

0:34:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I know we can do a lot more, but...

0:34:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_02
 Like in this kind of shape.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_04
 It's very annoying.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if it's handy.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and yeah, I think it will only look more like the old...

0:34:41	SPEAKER_03
...most controls.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_02
 This?

0:34:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_02
 The old ones looked like...

0:34:46	SPEAKER_02
...just a square thing.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay, but I had a lot of pictures.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, I can show you here.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_03
 What do you want to look like?

0:35:01	SPEAKER_00
 Hmm.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_03
 Curse, curves.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_03
 Even more...

0:35:08	SPEAKER_03
...bear as well.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_03
 This was a very small one.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, if you go very simple.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_01
 So we have to make a decision what kind of form it's going to have.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_03
 I think if...

0:35:32	SPEAKER_03
...my opinion,...if we just take the iPod and the same look,...or just put it in color,...but the same light colors.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_03
 And just together with the back lights,...look, we'll look very new.

0:35:51	SPEAKER_03
 No rubber buttons or something.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_03
 Just to get it with the back lights,...you'll get a totany new look,...more like the M-Pay 3 player.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_01
 You have to scroll button inside.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_01
 Why do you have to round it on the bottom then?

0:36:06	SPEAKER_01
 Just skip that one as well.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_03
 Doesn't have to be.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's cool.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's the trend before we want to make it.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah, I'm not a trend watcher, you are.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_04
 The trend is...

0:36:19	SPEAKER_01
...sponji.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_01
 Sponji?

0:36:21	SPEAKER_01
 And fruity, but yeah.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_04
 Spongebob.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_04
 It's not a lot of trends I find.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so we have still one minute left.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's okay if you just give it a bit square.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know something about ergonomic kind of fits in hand.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_01
 But I think it's still for older people.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_01
 You still have older people.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_01
 It's only annoying if it's like that form like that.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_01
 There is one.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_01
 But we're aiming at a young person.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_04
 There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_04
 And it looks original.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_04
 And I hope we can make it look not like the iPod itself.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_04
 It must have a very different...

0:37:07	SPEAKER_03
 The idea, but if you look at the way remote controls are now.

0:37:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, they're all...

0:37:13	SPEAKER_01
 But it is already fancy because it's a light on the bottom of the...

0:37:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay, so that's already a very big change.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe make the...

0:37:21	SPEAKER_01
 What's it called?

0:37:23	SPEAKER_01
 Scroll wheel, make it in yellow or something.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_01
 Just like the colors of real reaction.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah.

0:37:29	SPEAKER_04
 Now we could do that.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_04
 Could.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but if you change the front, the scroll wheel will still be yellow.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_03
 I think...

0:37:38	SPEAKER_03
 That's right.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_03
 The scroll wheel won't be very big.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_03
 Since if you put it somewhere in the chances that it will scroll out too big.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_03
 So it will just be a small... small scroll wheel.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_03
 So it won't stick out much.

0:37:55	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe the ones who are going to draw there, maybe have to ask to the...

0:38:01	SPEAKER_01
 To her if it...

0:38:04	SPEAKER_01
 It can work better than this because it doesn't work properly.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_03
 No, maybe you can just open images there and I will paint in paint.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it will be very good.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_04
 If you set it up and he will draw here.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_04
 Doesn't work.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so we just finish it.

0:38:24	SPEAKER_01
 So we make it a bit like...

0:38:26	SPEAKER_01
 Is that one probably?

0:38:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, is that okay?

0:38:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'm very more like...

0:38:31	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, only the color and the flashy light.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_01
 Just we skipped the... the... the... the... the speed recognition.

0:38:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, do we skip that?

0:38:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think.

0:38:40	SPEAKER_01
 Or keep that?

0:38:41	SPEAKER_01
 Let's see.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_01
 Definitely need that.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that one is false too.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know, yeah, I think so.

0:38:47	SPEAKER_02
 And we have to build in a microphone and...

0:38:50	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that's very easy.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_03
 We already have the beeping after...

0:38:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know anything about that.

0:38:57	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't receive any information on speed to...

0:38:59	SPEAKER_04
 I didn't receive the...

0:39:00	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, that's hard.

0:39:01	SPEAKER_03
 The information about that.

0:39:02	SPEAKER_04
 The main points I just said...

0:39:07	SPEAKER_04
 We have to be original in technological innovative.

0:39:11	SPEAKER_04
 Because, yeah.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_01
 So, just put the speed recognition in it as well, okay?

0:39:16	SPEAKER_03
 We'll pop it open then.

0:39:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_03
 So, we can put all the...

0:39:19	SPEAKER_01
 A function of that in there, yeah.

0:39:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:39:22	SPEAKER_01
 And we need... probably we need a... a false chip then.

0:39:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we probably need anything.

0:39:28	SPEAKER_02
 We probably need anything about it, doesn't it?

0:39:29	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:39:30	SPEAKER_02
 No, yeah.

0:39:31	SPEAKER_04
 Because we don't have any information about the cost.

0:39:33	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:39:34	SPEAKER_04
 We started with the information about the cost.

0:39:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I have some... I have some... some information about the cost, but...

0:39:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:39:39	SPEAKER_02
 Just about the chip.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_04
 And how much is the chip... the... the...

0:39:44	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know how much, but...

0:39:45	SPEAKER_02
 You are the vision as...

0:39:46	SPEAKER_02
 Just something new expensive...

0:39:47	SPEAKER_03
 Just something new expensive...

0:39:48	SPEAKER_03
 The future.

0:39:49	SPEAKER_03
 The integrated program...

0:39:50	SPEAKER_03
 Simple, sensor, simple speaker unit.

0:39:52	SPEAKER_03
 This is a very small electronic unit.

0:39:54	SPEAKER_03
 We'll give a standard answer after it...

0:39:56	SPEAKER_03
... recognize the question.

0:39:57	SPEAKER_04
 And how does it work?

0:39:59	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't say...

0:40:00	SPEAKER_03
 You say record, followed by your question sample, and after a few seconds...

0:40:04	SPEAKER_03
... the answer is simple.

0:40:08	SPEAKER_03
 Because...

0:40:10	SPEAKER_03
 So, it works like a good morning...

0:40:12	SPEAKER_03
... remote control, and then remote control says...

0:40:14	SPEAKER_03
... good morning.

0:40:15	SPEAKER_01
 But does that say anything?

0:40:16	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:40:17	SPEAKER_01
 It says something like...

0:40:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, we have to stop it now.

0:40:20	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that's integrated in the chip.

0:40:22	SPEAKER_03
 So, if you use the speech recognition...

0:40:24	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, that's... that's...

0:40:25	SPEAKER_03
 It's a separate chip.

0:40:27	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know, but if you use speech recognition...

0:40:30	SPEAKER_03
... that will be in it as well.

0:40:32	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:40:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know anything about this...

0:40:37	SPEAKER_01
 We just decide not to put it in, because it's too difficult.

0:40:40	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:40:42	SPEAKER_03
 It would be a good feature.

0:40:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's too.

0:40:45	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, we just put it in, because it's a good feature.

0:40:47	SPEAKER_03
 No, no worries about the cost, etc.

0:40:49	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, just a chip.

0:40:50	SPEAKER_04
 We have to stop it now.

0:40:51	SPEAKER_04

0:40:52	None
