0:00:30	None
 It won't wake up.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I was a bit early.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_00
 Why?

0:00:57	SPEAKER_03
 No, I just came in here normally.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_03
 I was one of them.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:01:02	None
 Come on.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_03
 Check, check, check.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_03
 Why won't it wake up?

0:01:05	SPEAKER_03
 Is it done?

0:01:06	SPEAKER_04
 It's probably that doesn't work.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_04
 You turn it off.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_03
 But huh?

0:01:33	SPEAKER_03
 No, I don't.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_02
 I received an email with a few possibilities on the materials.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_02
 So I will discuss them.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, we just came to the back later.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I was...

0:01:52	SPEAKER_01
 Shall we go and talk about the conceptual model?

0:01:56	SPEAKER_01
 Hello.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_03
 Which one was mine?

0:02:13	SPEAKER_01
 So that's me?

0:02:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so I'll just show you the menu.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_01
 What's it called?

0:02:33	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so we just talked about, you want me to show it there?

0:02:54	SPEAKER_01
 No, I just know.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_01
 I just talked about it, it looks nice, usability is very important, people don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_01
 It has to be very basic, not too many buttons.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_01
 Light switches, one if you use a button.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_01
 Textivity still has to be a possibility, and it has to be easy to learn.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_01
 What are the things I make minutes of?

0:03:28	SPEAKER_01
 And the functions are fully on channel to choose channels on or off a button and the textivity button that are the functions that are right.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's okay.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_01
 So I just want to give you Mike again the first presentation of your...

0:03:45	SPEAKER_04
 Shall I start?

0:03:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_00
 Nope.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, well, I received an email.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_04
 I searched the web, and I searched on this document, we sent an investigation of the remote control mark.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_04
 It has been done in Italy and in another country in Europe, I forget it.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_04
 But they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look and feel instead of the current functional look and feel.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_04
 It's very important for us to create something new.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_04
 So what Michil just said, it must be some very different from ordinary remote controls.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_04
 Fancy sense for an original look and feel of the case and interface.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_04
 This aspect is the most important one.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_04
 It came out of the research.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_04
 It is twice important as the following.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_04
 The second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological innovative.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_04
 That stands for new technical features.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_04
 And then this is a point of discussion because we just decided that we don't make use of LCD or speech recognition.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_04
 And this is the second important aspect and I think we must use some of the new technology to be innovative.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_01
 We already have the flashing light on that.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe, maybe something new.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_04
 We have to discuss about it.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not doing that.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_04
 Do not exist in current remote controls.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_04
 And that's very hard, I think.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_04
 The third one is the aspect that the remote controls should be easy to use.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_04
 But that was an overall point.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_04
 We already discussed that.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_04
 I've got one picture.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_04
 Our target group we thought about was Yo and Trendy.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_04
 So I took that part of the web page.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_04
 And it says, fashion watchers offer very friends in Italy.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_04
 I have to take that to following trends.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_04
 This trend I think is not that meaningful for us.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe, but it's about clothes and shoes.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_04
 But the next aspect also in contrast to last year, the feel of material is expected to be spongy.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_04
 Spongy.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_04
 What does spongy...

0:06:45	SPEAKER_03
 Spongy.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_04
 It's like a sponge.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_02
 So rubber, kind of.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_03
 Soft material.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe that's definitely a good idea because you've dropped your remote control very often on the ground.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_04
 So it has to be flexible.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_04
 It's something that stands there.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_04
 I didn't know what it means.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_04
 So spongy means...

0:07:07	SPEAKER_04
 Like a sponge.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_04
 Soft.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_04
 It's also a stress ball.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_01
 That's a good idea.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_01
 It's the bit like the borders of the remote control.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_01
 Or soft.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I have some material information that I'll give you later in my presentation.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_04
 What do I think?

0:07:31	SPEAKER_04
 Because a fancy look is the most important thing for remote control.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_04
 I think about changeable fronts.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe I see through one in a fruit front because it's hot.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_04
 And some basic color fronts.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_04
 So we can make five different fronts to start with or something.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe an extraordinary shape like a spongy.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_04
 Or yeah, just another shape than a normal remote control has just something round in it.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_04
 Or maybe not...

0:08:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_04
 We have to discuss about that.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, the main point still is the technological innovative.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, how do we do that?

0:08:20	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe speech?

0:08:22	SPEAKER_04
 We must have some kind of gadget.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I'll get back on that.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:08:28	SPEAKER_01
 It's very difficult to do it because it's only 12 and a half years you have to spend.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's the problem.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_03
 I got also an email from the technology department.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe watch the first...

0:08:42	SPEAKER_03
 The next research about it and even more possibilities now with speech.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_03
 So they recommend it using it.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_04
 Let's check what the...

0:08:54	SPEAKER_04
 First watch, both presentation first then.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_02
 No, actually we don't have an idea how much is going to cost.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it's cheap and...

0:09:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's easy to implement.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_03
 They don't say how much it will cost though.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_03
 But if we implement...

0:09:09	SPEAKER_03
 It's mass production, speech classification.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_03
 I think it would be better to implement LCD as well.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_03
 Since you have to configure speech.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_01
 That's definitely more expensive than...

0:09:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's something I don't know.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_04
 But we're going to make many of those so we can start a mass prediction and then...

0:09:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but it does.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_04
 So this will be...

0:09:32	SPEAKER_01
 But the telephones also have LCD and...

0:09:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so we've got it.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_01
 That's about 200 euros.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_01
 We have to decide on that.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_04
 That was this.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I got an email.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_02
 And it says the chip can be simple, regular or advanced.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_02
 And they say a display requires an advanced chip.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_02
 And this is more expensive than all the other chips.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_02
 So it smells the most expensive.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_03
 It smells the most expensive.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it says an email.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_02
 The display requires an advanced chip.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_03
 And speech recognition?

0:10:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, probably too.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_02
 I haven't got anything about speech recognition.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_02
 But that's the most expensive chip we need if we do...

0:10:33	SPEAKER_03
 For doing a display.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you can...

0:10:42	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_03
 To make a sort of a design.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_03
 So I did some searching on the internet.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_03
 And what's the old remote controls and use remote controls?

0:10:59	SPEAKER_03
 I think we should...

0:11:01	SPEAKER_03
 This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_03
 I think we should go more to the iPod and the MP3 players.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, just mobile phones.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_01
 More than more than but still a little bit.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_03
 You probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_03
 Because when you're in remote control, you can see it here.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_03
 You have to both reach both sides.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_03
 And you just have one few buttons.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_03
 So that's the main difference.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_03
 But it looks...

0:11:29	SPEAKER_03
 I definitely think we should go like this.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_03
 And then changeable funds.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:11:37	SPEAKER_03
 That's the most important part I think.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_03
 But on the home basis, something like that, something simple.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_03
 Well, and then I just ordered the buttons a bit.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_03
 The basic buttons on off mute.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_03
 And maybe two others.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, text button.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, text button, maybe there and there.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_03
 And then the color buttons, if we want it on.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_03
 I don't find it very usable.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_03
 No, I don't think it fits in the modern theme as well.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_03
 So, and then where you saw the display in the iPod, you can put the basic buttons.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_03
 One, two, three, four.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_03
 And above ten.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_03
 That's on the display.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, there was no display there.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_03
 But it's on the place of the display.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_03
 And I think we should light this up much more than that part.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_03
 So the focus is on these two parts.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_03
 So you don't see all the buttons.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_01
 But this one is very difficult to use because the volume and channel is on the bottom of it.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_01
 So you can use it down for it.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_03
 This is how it is now.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_03
 Here, well, well, it's volume.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_02
 I think it is on the bottom too.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_02
 It's not the best.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_03
 Well, here, I've also side scrolls.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if you can use that.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I've got something on the edge.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_01
 For volume or channel.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_03
 For volume.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_03
 Well, then we can even simplify it more by just putting the volume on the side.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_03
 And just channel buttons here.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think the channel buttons are often used.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_02
 And you can use them now with your thumb because the thing is not easy to use.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_02
 Well, control.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_03
 Basically, that's here.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we should put that on top.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's better.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_01
 We don't use on the above button.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, just the older buttons like text TV.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 Put that on the button.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_02
 Because you can't hold it.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_01
 You can't hold it alone.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_01
 And push the buttons.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_01
 Except from the on off button.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, okay.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_03
 Well, yeah.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_02
 I think you'll use the switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_02
 Like one, two, three.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe we can put that on the bottom.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe I don't know.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_02
 Like zapping is just switching.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it's not easy if it's below.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_03
 It's hardly to zap.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_03
 So I think it should be easy.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's pretty standard.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_03
 These row buttons on the top.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_03
 That's good.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_03
 If you don't light them up, they don't seem very good.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's modern to light this area up and to light this area up.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_03
 So the focus gets on this part and not on there.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_03
 But the position, of course, can be different.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_03
 We have to look at what's easy to use and how it's easier to use.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_03
 So we can switch these to, I don't know if it will look good if you put those on the bottom F.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_02
 No, I think the top buttons are okay.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_02
 Those should be on top.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, maybe we can switch those to.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and you have to make sure it's easy to use.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, that's to be big enough so you can heal.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that's my finding.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_03
 So my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look and play player.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_03
 And, well, if you want to put in a speak recognition or something, I don't think we should put it on top then.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_03
 I think that if you're going to put in more technology, that you need to be able to switch it open.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's cool.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_03
 So if you put in a speech recognition, you need so many more buttons, which won't look good on the front side, I think.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_03
 So that's something we have to decide on.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we have to keep it simple.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_01
 We have to decide this lecture or this.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_01
 What are we going to do?

0:15:55	SPEAKER_01
 Fifty minutes, yeah.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:15:58	None
 How is this going to look?

0:16:02	None
 Okay.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_02
 The component design.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_02
 I think that some similar devices and my own common knowledge.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_02
 So this was on the website.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_02
 If you aim at a young public, you should use materials that are soft with primary colors, like green, blue, red.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_02
 So fleshy kind of colors.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_02
 Shapes should be curved.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_02
 So round shapes, nothing square like.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_01
 So, okay.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_03
 Your iPod is trendy.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_03
 And it is.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_03
 No curved square.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_02
 It's right.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but it has round corners, I think.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_02
 So we shouldn't have two square corners.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_03
 Not the old box look.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_02
 And sports and gaming divine style characteristics.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know exactly what that means, but it should be, well, yeah.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_02
 Popular kind of.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we have to put our real reaction logo as well on the removed controls.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_01
 So the colors also, so we have made make it in black, black, yellow.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, black yellow control.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe the sides in yellow and the top black.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_02
 Not that weird because we definitely want to make it kind of fleshy to attract a young public.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I don't think the colors black and yellow go well together.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the front.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_02
 That's just a matter of taste.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_02
 We have to use kind of fleshy colors.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_03
 We can't use different fronts with all with the logo on it.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_02
 Can we do that?

0:18:11	SPEAKER_01
 Like France in red and yellow and blue and still transparent.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_03
 But with all with logo on it.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_02
 Well, this is a remote control, a very old one.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_02
 Then the components, the case, just here's black.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we have to make it from soft material.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_02
 But anyways, it should be transparent.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_03
 We decided that.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_03
 No one of the options.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_03
 You can just like a mobile phone.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_03
 You can make a perfect font on it.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_03
 So you can just replace them.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we could do that.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_01
 Or just give five with them just in the box.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but you could make them like blue and transparent.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_02
 The buttons, normal rubber, I think.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_02
 Like normal ordinary buttons.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_01
 It could be like a Nokia, like the new.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_03
 With a hard part.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_03
 Rubber really has an old look.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_04
 And then the new modern remote controls.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_04
 The buttons are part of the style.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's part of the remote control itself.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_04
 It's one out of one shape.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't, is a button.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's all on one level.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't come out of the background.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_04
 It is in the remote control.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I know what you mean.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_02
 So we have to keep it on one level.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, like mobile phones.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_02
 The top is, yeah.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_02
 So that should be hard plastic than the buttons.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_02
 I think.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_03
 Or maybe what kind of material it is.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can make it around platform soft material.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_01
 Just only the basic remote control from normal plastic and the rounds of it from software.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_02
 And then the LED.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_02
 The normal infrared LED, I think.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_02
 It's sufficient.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_02
 And backlight LEDs.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_02
 But I think we have to make the case transparent.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_02
 Otherwise the backlight won't work.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_02
 So if you put, you can just, you can just, you can just, you can just, you know, run the buttons.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's right.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_03
 Or run the whole.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but we can still make it transparent.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_03
 So, you can, you know, half transparent or just that it comes out a bit.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_02
 Good.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_02
 And green color, the backlight?

0:21:07	SPEAKER_02
 Or?

0:21:08	SPEAKER_02
 Difference, I think.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_03
 Also.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_01
 Blue.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_01
 Blue.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_03
 Red.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_03
 Whatever you want.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_03
 I think it depends on the color.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can choose it when you buy it.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_02
 Now, I think there are multiple color LEDs.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_02
 So.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_02
 Is it?

0:21:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but can you change the tool?

0:21:25	SPEAKER_02
 I know.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I know.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it's more important.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it's more expensive.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's, I think it's, I have a blinking light on my phone and I can change the color

0:21:37	SPEAKER_01
 of it. Okay, cool.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_01
 Just make it some different colors, blue, red and green.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it's too expensive, but.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I don't think so.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_03
 Put in any fancy technology yet.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_02
 Then some more technical things.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what it is, but it should be there, I think.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_02
 This is normal circuit board, like chip board in a lot of things.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_01
 You have to hurry up a bit.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_02
 So we just need this and this transistors and resonators.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_02
 This is all these kind of things.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_02
 They basically said that's almost the same on any remote control.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_02
 I guess we just need that.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what they do or.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, you can change.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_02
 Now, but they just said we needed the battery contacts like normal batteries.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_02
 You can put it.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, recharge maybe.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we just make sure.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_01
 We still want to have a recharge.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but we don't want to have a, how do you call it?

0:22:44	SPEAKER_02
 Aku.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_02
 Recharge.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_02
 Recharge.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_01
 Just batteries.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_02
 Rechargeable batteries.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_02
 Rechargeable batteries.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_02
 Not a separate.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_02
 No, just rechargeable batteries.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_02
 And a chip, that's this one.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_02
 Then I received some possibilities.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_02
 For the energy source, we can use batteries or a kinetic, like with the pulse watch.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_02
 So it operates on your wrist.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_01
 So if you have a normally good remote control on the table or on the...

0:23:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't think it will work.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_02
 And we can also use solar cells, but you must use it indoors.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 Just batteries.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_01
 That's cheaper.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and we can use the home station kind of thing.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_02
 Cases, flat.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_02
 So uncurfed.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 2D curved is like front to the back.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_02
 And 3D curved is also in depth.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_02
 So that's possible.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_02
 But with 3D curved remote controls, we must use rubber buttons.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_02
 So we can't use the flat.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_02
 So we need 2D.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_02
 Definitely.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_02
 These kind of materials can be used.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't really matter.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_01
 We just make it plastic.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_02
 I think so too.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_01
 Scroll wheels.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_01
 That's cool.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, scroll wheels.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:13	None
 That's good.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_02
 We can use multiple scroll wheels too if we want to, but I think just the volume is enough.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_02
 For channels, it's not handy.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_03
 You scroll.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_03
 And the LCD.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_02
 So we need the expensive, most expensive chip if we use an LCD.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think that's an opportunity.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_02
 Just skip it.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_01
 Because we don't have time for that to.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, done.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_01
 We must use the second most expensive chip.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_02
 So the regular chip.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_02
 Because we use scroll wheels.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_02
 And yeah, that was it.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_02
 Are we using a rubber case or?

0:24:53	SPEAKER_02
 I've decided.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we have to skip that one as well.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it will be.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_03
 It should be soft.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_04
 The trend is spongy.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_04
 And fruit or fresh.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_04
 Now we have nothing about those two.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_03
 Fruit and fresh can be just the covers.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_03
 Just on the spongy.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_03
 I can't imagine.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_03
 I don't like it.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_04
 I just got an imagine.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_03
 So just hard plastic?

0:25:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_02
 Titanium.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_02
 Titanium.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_03
 Titanium.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's too expensive.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe the form has to be a bit different.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_01
 Not the square form just a bit.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you can make it curve or round.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_02
 But just in 2D, not in depth.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_01
 So.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_01
 If we have to decide which one we're going to choose from these.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_01
 What exactly?

0:26:04	SPEAKER_01
 Because we have to know it.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_01
 So the energy is to recharge.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_01
 We already know that.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_01
 The chip on print is a normal one.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_01
 The case is just a plus.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_01
 The chip is the regular one.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_02
 You have to simple one regular and it's found.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_02
 So it should be regular in the second.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_02
 I think I'll just check in.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_01
 And we need a plastic case with a scroll wheel.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_01
 On it at least.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_01
 That's pretty much it.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_01
 And it's actually live.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm not sure.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if we're expected to roll on this one at this moment.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_02
 Or should we do it in the next meeting?

0:26:58	SPEAKER_03
 ID and you ID work together on prototype drawing on smartboard.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_03
 So we should do it here.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_03
 So we're staying here.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_01
 Or should we do it in the next meeting?

0:27:06	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's the next meeting.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_01
 But you definitely get a specific instruction.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_03
 For the means alone again.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_01
 But think about something that's more rounded.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_01
 Just and more.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_01
 I bet just on the top.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_03
 Just the bottom.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_03
 See if I can see any of these.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe the wheel can be like this.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_01
 If you draw it like this.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_01
 Get it.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_01
 What the fuck is it?

0:27:44	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_01
 Doesn't work.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_01
 See what I mean?

0:27:50	SPEAKER_01
 If I draw here.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_00
 What?

0:27:53	SPEAKER_01
 It draws about four centimeters over there.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can make it like this.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_01
 And this is all the wheel for a volume.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_01
 So the hue just is all rounded.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_01
 So you can do like a very big scroll wheel.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_01
 But just not on the top, but on the side of it.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_01
 So we just left this at the moment.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_02
 I think you'll get a lot of volume changing when it's not one.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_01
 So we do have this.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_01
 Is that okay?

0:28:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's probably better.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_02
 But maybe we can make a plastic so that if you drop it, it won't change the volume.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_03
 That's quite a lot of the way.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_01
 Like this.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_01
 And what's the channel choose?

0:28:51	SPEAKER_01
 Where do we put that?

0:28:54	SPEAKER_01
 I think in middle.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_03
 Middle or?

0:28:56	SPEAKER_03
 What is the middle part?

0:28:58	SPEAKER_01
 That's the numbers.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_02
 I think the numbers should be in the bottom.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_02
 And the switch channel in the middle.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_03
 I agree as well.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't make a difference if you put the switch channels inside of each other, on top of each other, because you already have the volume here.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_01
 So you can also put it here one bit and the other one there.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_01
 Next to each other.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_01
 So you can also put it all on the top and this.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_01
 You keep this empty because you have to hold it as well.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_02
 Or you could do the switch channel up button above the numbers and switch channel down button.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_01
 That's not the one you want to zap very quick.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_03
 I think zapping is the highest priority and then you use those.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_01
 It is the opportunity.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, of course.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should put them on top of each other.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_02
 Why?

0:29:48	SPEAKER_02
 Because then it's easy to know if I push the...

0:29:52	SPEAKER_01
 But still the next one.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but the top button is like you switch channel up and down button is...

0:30:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but if you put them...

0:30:01	SPEAKER_01
...on the left of the right is exactly the same.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's...

0:30:05	SPEAKER_02
...but I think left to right is more often associated with volume.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_02
 And top down is more with channel changing.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_02
 No, that's not...

0:30:14	SPEAKER_02
 It's like almost remote controls.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_00
 Everyone has control.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_02
 So if we use that, they will probably have a long learning time.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_01
 You already have volume on the side so you can't make it...

0:30:26	SPEAKER_01
...you can't make a mistake.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's simple.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_03
 It's just...

0:30:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_01
 So that's for you.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_03
 I'll take a look at it.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so...

0:30:36	SPEAKER_01
 What else do we have to discuss about?

0:30:39	SPEAKER_01
 I think we need to work three minutes again.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we have to get it that looks really new because we still hold on to the ordinary...

0:30:55	SPEAKER_04
...square...

0:30:56	SPEAKER_04
...re-not control.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_04
 Because what I see, the only difference in the...

0:31:01	SPEAKER_04
...in fact is that we use a scroll wheel on the outside.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_04
 And the left.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but it should be around in shape.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:31:11	SPEAKER_03
...controlless are all black and plastic.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_03
 You have to look at that image of the iPod.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_03
 More depth kind of style.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_03
 And not the old gray black.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_03
 Some kind of blingling.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_04
 Well, you can put a very...

0:31:26	SPEAKER_03
 If we do it like that, we have below every...

0:31:29	SPEAKER_03
...a lot of room to put a nice logo.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the logo has to be on there.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_04
 That's right.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_04
 And how many fonts do we put on the market then?

0:31:39	SPEAKER_04
 Five or something?

0:31:40	SPEAKER_04
 More or is your friends a custom?

0:31:43	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you can buy separate ones.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_04
 And buy the product you buy, you get one.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_04
 And you get one.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_04
 Or basic.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_04
 Or you can choose one if you buy the project.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_01
 No, there will be.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_01
 So you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharge.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_01
 Is that a good opportunity?

0:32:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so I put it like that.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, you let it slide in the docking station.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_02
 Do we have to design that as well?

0:32:13	SPEAKER_02
 The docking station?

0:32:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think so.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we can...

0:32:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that can be very simple.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_03
 It could be just a recharge.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_03
 Just a square, just a second.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, around something.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we had one example.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_02
 But we have to make contacts on the remote control and the recharging as well.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but that's a round one.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we can choose them.

0:32:49	SPEAKER_03
 Here you just see one.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_03
 That's very round.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_03
 So I think that can be all kind of shapes.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_01
 But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_02
 That's a remote control.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_03
 So you don't want to...

0:33:08	SPEAKER_03
 Just like the iPod and fills, but...

0:33:11	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_03
 More rounded.

0:33:13	None
 Yeah.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think it will just look like more like this one.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_03
 Since this is also rounded.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_03
 No, just the corners.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, those are already a bit cornered.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but we can do all kinds of...

0:33:29	SPEAKER_02
 As long as it is in 2D, we can use all kind of round shapes.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_03
 But then we have to think of something totally new.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but if we want to make it kind of new...

0:33:46	SPEAKER_03
 I've had a lot of pictures of old ones and all curves have already been done.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_01
 It's a bit annoying, is it?

0:33:59	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_04
 What do we do wrong?

0:34:03	SPEAKER_04
 Just more like this and not...

0:34:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, okay.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but we could do a lot more curving.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_03
 Like we do with...

0:34:16	SPEAKER_03
 I know we can do a lot more, but...

0:34:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_02
 Like in this kind of shape.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_04
 It's very annoying.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if it's handy.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think it will only look more like the old...

0:34:41	SPEAKER_02
 How much controls?

0:34:43	SPEAKER_02
 This?

0:34:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_02
 The old ones look like just a square thing.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay, but I had a lot of pictures.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, I can show you here.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_03
 What the old ones look like.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_00
 Mm.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_03
 Curves, curves.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_03
 I'll leave more than here as well.

0:35:11	None
 Yeah, okay.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_03
 This was a very small one.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it could go very simple.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_01
 So we have to make a decision what kind of form it's going to have.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_03
 I think, in my opinion, if we just take the iPod...

0:35:36	SPEAKER_03
 And the same look.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_03
 So, light, or just whatever color, but the same light color as.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_03
 And just together with the back lights, we'll look very new.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_03
 No rubber buttons or something.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_03
 Just together with the back lights, you'll get a totally new look.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_03
 More like the MP3 player.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_01
 You have to scroll button inside.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_01
 So why do we have to round it on the bottom then?

0:36:06	SPEAKER_01
 Skip that one as well.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_03
 Doesn't have to be?

0:36:09	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's cool.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's a trend if we want to make it.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah, I'm not a trend watcher, you are.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_04
 The trend is...

0:36:19	SPEAKER_01
 A spongy.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_01
 Spongy?

0:36:21	SPEAKER_01
 A fruity.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_04
 Spongy bar.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_04
 Spongy.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_04
 It's not a lot of friends, I find.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so we have still one minute left.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know something about ergonomic kind of fits in hand.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_01
 But I think it's still for older people.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_01
 You still have older people.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_01
 It's only annoying if it's like that form like that.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_01
 Like whatever.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_01
 There is one.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but we're aiming at a young...

0:36:54	SPEAKER_04
 There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_04
 And it looks original and I hope we can make it look not like the iPod itself.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_04
 It must have an idea.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_03
 But if you look at the way remote controls are now...

0:37:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_01
 But it is, it is already fancy because it's a light.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay, so that's already a very big change.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe make the...

0:37:21	SPEAKER_01
 What's it called?

0:37:22	SPEAKER_01
 The scroll wheel, make it in yellow or something.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_01
 Just like the colors of real reaction.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well...

0:37:29	SPEAKER_04
 Now we could do that.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_04
 Could.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_04
 If you change the front, the scroll wheel will still be yellow.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_03
 I think...

0:37:38	SPEAKER_03
 That's right.

0:37:39	SPEAKER_03
 I think the scroll wheel won't be very big.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_03
 Since if you put it somewhere and chances that it will scroll are too big.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_03
 So it will just be a small... small scroll wheel.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_03
 So it won't stick out much.

0:37:55	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe the ones who are going to draw there, maybe have to ask to her if it can work better than this.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_01
 Because it doesn't work properly.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it's awesome.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you can just open images there and I'll paint and paint.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it will do a very good job.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_04
 If you set it back, he will draw here.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't work.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so just finish it.

0:38:24	SPEAKER_01
 So we make it a bit like... that one probably.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, is that okay?

0:38:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I agree more.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, only the color and the flashy light.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, we just skipped the focal or the speech recognition.

0:38:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, do we skip that?

0:38:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think.

0:38:40	SPEAKER_01
 Or keep that?

0:38:41	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, but you definitely need a...

0:38:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't know.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think so.

0:38:47	SPEAKER_02
 And we have to build in a microphone and...

0:38:50	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that's very easy.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_03
 We already have the beeping of the...

0:38:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know anything about that.

0:38:57	SPEAKER_04
 I didn't receive any information on speech recognition.

0:39:00	SPEAKER_04
 That's hard.

0:39:01	SPEAKER_03
 The information about this.

0:39:02	SPEAKER_04
 The main points I just said...

0:39:07	SPEAKER_04
 Do you have to be original in a technological innovative?

0:39:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_01
 So just put a speech recognition in it as well, okay?

0:39:16	SPEAKER_03
 So we'll just swap it open then.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:19	SPEAKER_01
 So we can put all the...

0:39:20	SPEAKER_01
 Function of that in there.

0:39:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:39:22	SPEAKER_01
 And we need a... probably we need an advanced chip then.

0:39:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we probably do.

0:39:27	SPEAKER_02
 But it doesn't say anything about it, does it?

0:39:29	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:39:30	SPEAKER_04
 We don't have any information about the cost.

0:39:33	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:39:34	SPEAKER_04
 We started with information about the cost.

0:39:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I have some information about the cost, but just about the chip.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_04
 And how much is the chip?

0:39:44	SPEAKER_02
 You know how much...

0:39:46	SPEAKER_03
 The business is just something you'll expand your information on.

0:39:48	SPEAKER_03
 The integrated programals, sample, sensor, sample, speaker unit.

0:39:52	SPEAKER_03
 This is a very small electronic unit.

0:39:54	SPEAKER_03
 We'll give a standard answer after it's recognized the question.

0:39:57	SPEAKER_04
 How does it work?

0:39:59	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't say.

0:40:00	SPEAKER_03
 You say record, followed by your question sample, and after a few seconds, the answer is sample.

0:40:06	SPEAKER_03
 The question is...

0:40:09	SPEAKER_03
 So it works like good morning remote control, and then remote control says...

0:40:13	SPEAKER_03
 Good morning.

0:40:14	SPEAKER_01
 But does that say anything?

0:40:16	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:40:17	SPEAKER_01
 Does it say...

0:40:18	SPEAKER_01
 Does it say something bad?

0:40:19	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, we have to stop it now.

0:40:20	SPEAKER_03
 No, no.

0:40:21	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that's integrated into chips, so if you use speech recognition, it's a separate chip.

0:40:27	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know, but if you use speech recognition, that will be in it as well.

0:40:32	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:40:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know anything about this.

0:40:37	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, we just decided not to put it in, because it's too difficult.

0:40:40	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:40:43	SPEAKER_03
 It would be a good feature.

0:40:45	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, we just put it in.

0:40:47	SPEAKER_03
 No worries about the cost, etc.

0:40:50	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, just stop it, man.

0:40:53	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, fine.

0:41:07	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.
