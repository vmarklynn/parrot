0:00:00	SPEAKER_05
 a I told the controller, well, I don't know.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_05
 So, I think we organized this meeting just to discuss...

0:00:56	SPEAKER_01
 I don't have my presentation.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_05
 To discuss the project that is on the web, I shall mark proposed about capturing audio, video and slides in a synchronized way.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_05
 So, we will start with an introduction, I think we will give you a few slides about reviewing Q&A systems.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_05
 And then even if we don't have many things to talk about, just to start discussing about clearly the project and also dealing with our kind of timing constraints.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_01
 And...

0:01:54	SPEAKER_05
 The USB card doesn't work.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_05
 And you didn't put on the...

0:02:00	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe you can access through the network if it's on your H, or it's on your D machine.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_05
 So, maybe we will be able to...

0:02:17	SPEAKER_01
 Keep going.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_05
 So, we had like five slides presenting different systems.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_05
 And maybe we can do that at the whiteboard, it's a bit stupid, but I think you remember well the different parts and I am sure we can do that at the whiteboard.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_01
 I really do something like that.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_05
 It would be great to use the whiteboard.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so I would like just to review the different project regarding acquisition system.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_01
 So, basically there are five systems.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_01
 The first one is called SMACK IDECO, which is developed by Fribor and CERN.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_01
 The second one is your system, I would like to say the cheap meeting room system.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_01
 The third one, yeah maybe I can share that.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_05
 So the first one is a SMACK?

0:03:19	SPEAKER_01
 The SMACK, yeah.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_01
 Should I write?

0:03:22	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, maybe.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_05
 Just a review of the...

0:03:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, sure, that's interesting.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_01
 The first one is, yeah, I will call that a.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_01
 SMACK, which is developed by Fribor and CERN.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_01
 The second one is B, which is Arizona, I would like to say cheap meeting room or...

0:03:51	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_00
 It's okay, cheap meeting room.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_05
 Well, cheap meeting room is the, you know...

0:03:56	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_00
 But for the moment, I listen to the loved ones.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_00
 For the moment, it's just to understand each other so we know...

0:04:02	SPEAKER_00
 I thought it was called PAS.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, for PAS.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_01
 PAS, yeah, good idea.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, PAS.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_01
 The third one is...

0:04:12	SPEAKER_00
 That sounds like a rezandropa.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's not the...

0:04:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, the third one is called...

0:04:21	SPEAKER_01
 This is the SMACK meeting room developed by Fribor, which is called...

0:04:27	SPEAKER_05
 SMACK, smart minute, but...

0:04:30	SPEAKER_00
 DIVA and SMACK, yeah.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_05
 SMACK, yeah, smart minute is all the process of capturing the minutes automatically, but...

0:04:38	SPEAKER_01
 DIVA.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_01
 DIVA.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_01
 D-I-V-A, something like that.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_01
 The third one is called...

0:04:49	SPEAKER_01
 The third one is the project that I have to improve the current smart meeting room at ADAP.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_01
 For that, we will use...

0:04:58	SPEAKER_01
 DIVA.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, tape three.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, let's call that...

0:05:07	SPEAKER_02
 DIVA.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_06
 Free.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_01
 And the last one, I would like just to mention, just for the meeting, this is the firewire.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if you saw my presentation during my time.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_01
 Did you...

0:05:29	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_01
 E, which is firewire.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_01
 So, I will start just with the SMACK.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe I draw a line here.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_01
 So the SMACK...

0:05:52	SPEAKER_01
 The SMACK project is a project which aims to do the acquisition of audio, video and slide for presentation.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, this project is done with free-boor and sound, but I'm just going to make a very short graphic.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_01
 In fact, they use a card, a video card, which is called...

0:06:21	SPEAKER_01
 I-VC...

0:06:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_01
 I just write I-VC.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_01
 In fact, this is a video card with four inputs.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_01
 On these four inputs, you can have only video, but they want to make also the slide acquisition.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_01
 So on one input, they put a conversion box, a converter, which converts from slide to video.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_01
 So that means that we decrease the quality.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_01
 We have a high quality in slide, and we go to lower quality, to lower quality with video.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_01
 So this one is just for the SMACK.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_01
 Now I will just move...

0:07:12	SPEAKER_05
 The three others are the video.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, these ones are just for video and audio.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_01
 You can use them, and this board does the dVx compression on the file.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_01
 This is the box that we have on the table, the card that we have on the table.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_05
 And I'd like to add that this...

0:07:30	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's quite ambitious project because it's with the SON, and they already worked on a European project called Indico, where they have released a full kind of conference software to manage all the conference aspects we have in the conference automatically.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_05
 And I know that Alfredo already installed in a big amphitheater for students.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_05
 And I guess it's currently working.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_05
 And just in balance with this, we didn't choose that solution because they had no...

0:08:18	SPEAKER_05
 The slides were not captured in a very precise way.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_05
 That's the point.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_05
 Otherwise it's fully automatic.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_05
 Are you disgusted with them? Did you discuss that?

0:08:32	SPEAKER_05
 Is it fully automatic? You don't know?

0:08:35	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. Well, I suppose, I suppose like a capture of things, right?

0:08:42	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I don't see why you could not capture the videos.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, we can't like this.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_05
 But is it all synchronized and is it doing all what we want, but without the slide precision?

0:08:57	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_00
 Let me cover this one important point.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_00
 The technical aspect, so the way you acquire things should be driven by the kind of processing you want to have.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_00
 So in our case, we need to have a good processing of slides.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_00
 That in our case it means to transcribe with an OCR and then make indexing.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_00
 We need to have a high resolution image.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_00
 I guess that's what you mean by precision.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_00
 Right? So in a sense, that's the point.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_00
 For us, we need to have this sufficient resolution image of slides to do what we want to do.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_00
 So that's why I guess we don't follow the solution.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_05
 And we are sure that in that context of SMAC project with the free brew working on document analysis, there were not enough precision and enough resolution in the slides.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_00
 As far as I know so far, they did similar works on meetings, document center meetings.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_00
 They always worked on manual transcriptions of documents.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_00
 So they never really took into account a possibility of actually performing processing on the document they talk about during the meeting and during in this case the talk, the conference, the presentation.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_00
 As far as they published them, I know the results they published so far.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_00
 So essentially they never took into account.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_00
 So I mean, they work at the eye level, which means basically we have the information coming from here and there.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_00
 And we create the techniques that allow to start from the text there and the things that are saved and we find contacts.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, they make some kind of processing.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_00
 But as they don't work on the low level, so low level means basically, okay, I take the speech and I start the transcription.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_00
 I take the image of the document and I take the transcription.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_00
 They basically don't really care of the aspect as far as I understand.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_00
 As far as I know.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_04
 As far as I know, I mean, they do, of course, they can do slide detection, slide change detection, which of course what I understood is also they try to recover the layout somehow.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, given the slides, but in no case they are extracting the text from the slides.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_04
 So this in all the cases what I've seen, in all the cases I've seen, they assume that at least they have like a PDF version of the document.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_04
 And basically they try to match what is displayed to the document.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_04
 So first they need to extract information from the document, which does not seem to be so trivial at least for, because they're also working with maybe more complex documents with images and text and so on.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe with slides it's easier to extract the information.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_04
 I assume it's easier indeed.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_04
 But they assume basically that they have this document, which is something somehow we would like to relax because people are like in an affiliate, they're like, you may not want each time to ask the person, maybe the person has a point point, not a PDF version or maybe it's using Excel to do a demonstration or something like this.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_00
 That's it, it makes less automatic in the sense that at a point you need someone giving the file and putting the file uploaded somewhere, etc.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_00
 And it is a different kind of process.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_00
 In some ways it's always driven by what you're able to do.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_00
 They work a lot on layout analysis.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_00
 I know they match the layout into XML files, etc.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_00
 So it's a different way of approaching the problem, which means a different way of capturing different exigencies in capturing different documents.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_04
 But most of the points for us would be valid.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_04
 Slide transition, we would use slide, we need to do slide transition.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_04
 To some extent we would like to extract some elements of the layout to this thing, to have a more higher analysis.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_04
 But we would like to do this more automatically and in particular for the text recognition to be able to do retrieval of slides or points of presentation.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_04
 We would like not to have to rely yet to a first PDF version or any version of the document.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so the solution to that low quality is solved by you project, the past project.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_01
 Make a tick here and I clean up.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_01
 This is just to solve that problem regarding the slide and the slide resolution.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_01
 So we remove that part and we call that the pass.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 And in that case we use a frame grabber here and we go with the slide here.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_01
 And of course these two cards will be on the same machine and we have to develop a solution here.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_01
 The main critical point is here the synchronization between these two cards.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_01
 With that, this is the card that we use in the smart meeting room and this is the card.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_04
 So you have both these cards, right?

0:14:17	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, this one is the video card and this one, this is the card that we have already

0:14:25	SPEAKER_04
 at EDAB for the... But I mean this one is the...

0:14:29	SPEAKER_00
 It's the same list.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so what I want to say is that on this card there are four inputs, right?

0:14:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, so...

0:14:36	SPEAKER_04
 So no, well, yeah.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_04
 I was thinking to some extent nothing would prevent us from also occurring the slide but it is a slide stream from this card indeed, right?

0:14:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, yeah, yeah.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_01
 So we can have both.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_01
 We can have the slide from the slide capture and we can just use a video signal to capture that also.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_01
 Do you want to have two quality, high quality and all of that?

0:15:08	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I mean just because we cannot... something we cannot do with the high quality capture device is to have a stream, I mean the stream, right?

0:15:19	SPEAKER_04
 The full stream.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we can just take some snapshots.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_04
 So we can take snapshots.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_04
 So basically it may be interesting to have still the slide stream so that, for instance, if we detect there is any video that is displayed or so on, to some extent we could just cut these videos to keep it and to be able to replay it later on and so on.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_04
 And maybe indeed if, for instance, the slide stream on the right is automatically synchronized with the other parts of the video.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_04
 It may be easier to synchronize directly by some matching process.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_04
 The slide, the high quality images we have here.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_01
 With this one.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you won't.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_01
 So you would...

0:16:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_01
 Something like...

0:16:06	SPEAKER_02
 Is this something like that?

0:16:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, exactly.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_04
 So at least this is not at the electronic level but you would say at the content level, doing an alignment from the slide stream and from the snapshots we would have on the other side with something that might be possible.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_04
 Of course if we have some constraints given by the electronic, I mean that's better.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_04
 Because of course first the process is going to be easier and it might be just a few seconds that we have to align on the other parts but I think I could see, I could imagine that this could be a reasonable process to do especially because this would solve some of the issues regarding, I mean, the possibility of displaying videos after, from what we recall.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_04
 Definitely.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_01
 So I was just talking about the past project.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe I would like just now to talk about the DIVA project.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_01
 So I clean up.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:09	None
 Yeah.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_01
 Did you rate something regarding the DIVA project?

0:17:17	SPEAKER_04
 Well, this is more or less what we just discussed.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we just remember that here we still have only one machine to do the slide video and audio acquisition.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_01
 In the DIVA it was something different.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_01
 In fact we have a master machine.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_01
 We have a master machine here and we have some slaves machine here.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_01
 We have some connection and here we have some inputs.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_01
 We have audio usually we have audio and the same for this one.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_01
 And basically on the slave machine we have two cards, one for audio and one for video.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_01
 So they develop something to synchronize these two cards together and this is something which is more a product which is called a direct show which allows you to synchronize these two cards together.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_01
 But of course you want these two streams to be synchronized but you want also these two streams to be synchronized.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_01
 So they have a synchronization between two slaves which is done by the master.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_01
 Here we just use the ethernet network to synchronize these two devices.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_01
 I just find it's not something like that.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_01
 And they do only audio and video or they don't do any slide.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_01
 So it was for the DIVA.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_01
 I would like to talk regarding the fire free smart meeting room to have an equation.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_01
 Tape free.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_01
 Tape free.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
 Tape free.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_01
 Tape free smart meeting room.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_01
 So for that.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_04
 So like the DIVA project is a tape free smart.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_01
 It's a tape free but also video.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_01
 The acquisition is done in raw video.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_01
 So the file is huge and they really need a long processing to convert raw file to a DIVA XOR to R and files.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_04
 But this can be done automatically right.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah but it takes time.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_01
 It's just a mention.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm really right.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_05
 And that's what they use more less in TNOs.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_05
 They don't have dapes.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_05
 But with different cards.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_05
 They had something.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe first I will just describe the smart meeting room that we have at T DIVA.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_01
 In fact we have also a master slave architecture.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 I clean a little bit.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_01
 And which takes care about the audio.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 I clean that.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_01
 And we have the slave PC which takes care about the whiteboard and the slides.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_01
 Now if we look at the video.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_01
 In fact, maybe first I should mention that between the master and the slave.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_01
 We have the synchronization signal which is called MIDI time code.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_01
 I just write MIDI.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_01
 And for the video we have the video input here.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_01
 We reuse the MIDI signal with to insert the time code on each frame.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_01
 And we save that to dv recorder.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_01
 We know the problem of that.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_01
 Somebody has to take care of the dv tapes and convert them into dv eggs.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_01
 So my idea is to do something like that.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_01
 It's to develop a video slave machine.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_01
 I say something like that.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_01
 We have a video slave machine which use the MIDI time code.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_01
 I'm doing something.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_01
 We have the video here.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_01
 We just have the time code inserted.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_01
 So we take that signal here and we move to this machine here.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_01
 Which is in fact just the IBC video call.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_01
 This is just an acquisition call.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_01
 And we convert file directly to dv eggs.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_01
 And so we will have here video.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_01
 And also because we want to control that machine we use also the MIDI time code.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 The MIDI time code to start and to stop the machine.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_01
 This is just something like that.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_01
 This is just to remove the dv recordings.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_01
 But just this is just an improvement of the smart material.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_01
 Do you have any questions regarding that?

0:23:45	SPEAKER_04
 Currently because there is a time code, video time code.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_04
 You don't care about frame dropping.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_04
 I mean because anyway you need to frame in the video signal.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_04
 It is encoded time.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_01
 We don't have to care about the synchronization in that case because the time code is inserted here.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_01
 And we take after the time code insertion we take the video signal and we pass through the machine.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_01
 So this is a simple solution but where we don't have to care about the synchronization.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_05
 Because the synchronization problem comes from the grabbing from the dv tape.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_05
 The synchronization is in dvicks so it is afterwards.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_04
 Well but you don't, I mean at this point you don't really care because I mean in the signal you can extract the time.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_04
 I mean the time stamp is in the signal.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_04
 So if you drop some frame which happens sometimes when you do compression or acquisition.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_04
 You will automatically find this in the signal.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_04
 I mean it is encoded in the image so you can do it otherwise.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_04
 If there is some frame dropping you have to rely on the number of frames you are counting or else as it goes to us.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_04
 It is impossible.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_04
 So you have some problems.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_01
 So the last one is the firewire acquisition.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_01
 I just.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_04
 Which was more or less TNO.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_04
 It is a problem.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_04
 Respect to frame dropping.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_05
 They didn't have too much frame dropping.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_05
 The problem was it was not synchronized.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_05
 So the time code was wrong for the different videos.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_05
 They had at the beginning of the video you saw the time code.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_05
 It was 6 hours and 50 minutes and there were 4 hours and 32 minutes.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_05
 So it was a problem with the time code.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_04
 I think if it was not a problem of frame dropping the alignment would have been quite easy to do.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_05
 Well that is what they did manually afterwards.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_05
 But they didn't have too much frame drops.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_05
 In fact.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_04
 No really.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_04
 It was not a difficult process.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_05
 Well it is manual to synchronize.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah but if it is only to find one offset.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah that is what they did.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_04
 Some examples.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_04
 But I had the feeling that there are also some frame dropping.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_04
 That was.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_05
 No no because we did the software here and it did not.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_01
 In fact the major problem regarding acquisition system is always the synchronization and for that firewire is good.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_01
 I mean firewire was a project.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_01
 Now the project is standby.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_01
 We don't move to that project but I am just going to talk about this one.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_01
 So with acquisition systems the major problem is the synchronization and firewire gives you some way to be synchronized.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_01
 In fact this is I just want to describe here the bus.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah this is the bus where you can send some package.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_01
 Any device we which wants to send a package.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_01
 A package sorry.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_01
 Should ask there is a manager of that bus.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_01
 This is just the bus.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_01
 Any device which wants to send a package has to require some bandwidth.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_01
 So after that he will have that bandwidth and he will always have that bandwidth.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_01
 So yeah he will always have that bandwidth and so we are sure that we will have a synchronized application with firewire and so that means that.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah sorry sorry.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_05
 No problem.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_05
 This is done at the libraries etc.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_05
 To true well all you are saying about asking about bandwidth etc.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_05
 It's done by hardware.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_01
 So we don't have to code or communication.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_01
 And in fact yeah as I mentioned before we have a bus manager and the bus manager send just a flag to say now it's time to give me your data and all devices which have required some bandwidth will send the data.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_01
 So I am just drawing something like that.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_01
 This is this kind of signal that the bus manager is sending and just after that bus just after that signal all device will send the data.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_01
 So we will have the data from A from B and from C and so on.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_01
 And after the next one we will have again the data from A, B and C and so on and so on.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_01
 With firewire we are sure to have an acquisition system.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_01
 Now the major problem with firewire is that firewire is just an kind of intelligent smart pipe, a synchronized pipe.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_01
 We can put what we want inside.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_01
 So we can put raw data or we can send a devics data or we can send also what I was presenting in my time presentation was H.264.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_01
 But in that case we need something hardware here to encode raw data to a given former.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_01
 Of course the idea is to reduce the bandwidth on the bus also.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_01
 And all data are sent to the master.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_01
 Do you have any questions?

0:30:19	SPEAKER_00
 Now basically we have all this kind of general view about all the systems.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can take this opportunity to come back to our system because we have a long discussion and finally we decided for one approach and maybe take the opportunity to look just a moment at what point we are and when we plan basically to get something done working.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_00
 I can add to that list of projects something that Shamaar can meet.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_00
 And in the future we have a little bit of a background in the literature.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_00
 There is FXPAL that is doing something very similar to what we do here basically.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_00
 A capture through the projector signal of the slides and for the moment they just plan to use the slides as a way to index the presentations.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_00
 But roughly it is an idea that is very similar to our idea.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_00
 And this is up to you to tell us roughly what do you think.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_05
 We will have something working.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_05
 So we will be done together to try to divide the time.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_05
 What do we do?

0:31:32	SPEAKER_05
 We do not want today to put deadlines.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_05
 But what we have, what we can do and how we will be able to do.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_05
 I was thinking for instance in what we have because I do not know a lot about using like GLL, MFC, Microsoft software.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_05
 But I am very happy to do that.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_05
 So what we have until now is the software that Darren did for the frame grabbing.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_05
 And actually I can start playing and looking at this in detail.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_05
 So Darren software about frame grabbing.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_05
 Not MFC.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_05
 MFC.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_05
 And GLL etc.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_05
 All the windows are programming.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_05
 So this is one step.

0:32:49	SPEAKER_05
 Then the audio video card.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_05
 So first we need to look at this, to look at the demos that are with what they call the SDK software development kit.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_05
 And the demos testing the card with only one audio for instance and only one video.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_05
 And even testing with only the slides to capture all the videos stream.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_01
 In fact the slide card, sorry the slide card and the video card are both SDK.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_05
 So you mean the frame grabbing card?

0:33:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_01
 Both are SDK.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_05
 They have SDK software development kit that is based on MFC libraries.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_05
 C++ libraries.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_01
 This is for that.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_05
 I do not remember by half now.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_05
 So once you have tested individually the card we can test to synchronize the audio and the video together.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_01
 Usually audio and video should be synchronized.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_01
 Because this just an audio video channel.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_01
 So they are synchronized.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_01
 So we can play with the video, we can play with the slide.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_01
 And after that the major point is to combine both.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_05
 And now as you said, the next point will be to use that card with the other card and to merge the slide signal with the, well, the synchronization signal coming from the frame grabbing card.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_05
 It is not a synchronization signal.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_05
 It is a slide with that.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_01
 We do not have synchronization.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_01
 We have to find a solution.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_01
 And for that, maybe we can use a direct show, which is a thing.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_01
 Which is a technique to synchronize different device.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_05
 And is it external to this card?

0:35:12	SPEAKER_05
 It is external?

0:35:13	SPEAKER_01
 No, this is just an application.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_05
 So it is external.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_05
 It is not in this card.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, no.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_01
 It is not on the card, it is just an application that runs on the machine.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_01
 And we do not have to buy that.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_01
 Or at least at least the base.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_05
 I think, Rachel, you can download for free.

0:35:39	SPEAKER_05
 I am not sure.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_05
 I should check.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_05
 And that will help us to synchronize this from grabbing card and this video card.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_05
 We need to do some tests.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_05
 Reading.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_05
 And then when we have, okay.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_05
 Where do we do that?

0:36:02	SPEAKER_05
 We do not know yet with Frank if we installed this card.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe he.

0:36:06	SPEAKER_01
 I think the best thing to do is to have a machine which is only dedicated to that.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_01
 Because our...

0:36:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_01
 If you use a machine which has been already used for something else, sometimes you have plenty of libraries and so you don't know exactly.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it would be better to have just a dedicated machine just for that.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_00
 Be careful because I listen to Frank and apparently don't want to buy a new machine.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_00
 Just for which we show that this works.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to use material that is already available.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_04
 And then we need to do some machines.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe there are some free machines.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_05
 Well, my machine, his machine, no, this machine.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:36:49	SPEAKER_00
 So it is possible to use other machines?

0:36:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_04
 I mean just that, you know, if of course you don't want to have a library that might conflict with the one you are trying to use at the same time if you crash a machine, I mean, because you are doing some tests you may not want.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_04
 Do you have what's on your machine?

0:37:06	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, it's too good to be erased or what's weather.

0:37:11	SPEAKER_04
 So I think this is true.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe there is a machine, I don't know whether for this you need, you know, a very powerful machine and so on.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_04
 But maybe there is a possibility to use a current machine.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_00
 With some other machine, yeah.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_04
 Because we've drawn from the network.

0:37:27	SPEAKER_01
 Because I think the video is done.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_01
 The video compression is done on that car.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_01
 And I'm not 100% sure.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_01
 But I think the GPAC conversion for the slide capture is done also on the car.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_01
 So we don't need.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but still I mean even if it's done on the car, the basic thing you need to check is the best, right?

0:37:58	SPEAKER_01
 I mean the best way to speed up.

0:38:01	SPEAKER_01
 But I mean, I was just thinking about the speed of the computer could be lower.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_04
 CPU itself may not be so good.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_04
 Access.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_00
 So in terms of time, what we can think, what we can expect to see.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_04
 Can we expect a Christmas gift?

0:38:26	SPEAKER_00
 Christmas gift.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_00
 So early Christmas to early summer.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, Christmas gift.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, that's a good question.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe the first solution will be just to start with, because we need to start with something.

0:38:41	SPEAKER_01
 We have the slide capture from Darren.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_01
 We have, I will work on the video acquisition for the tape free smart fitting room.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_01
 So I will start with that to develop some knowledge regarding that board, that video board.

0:38:58	SPEAKER_01
 And after that we can combine both.

0:39:00	SPEAKER_00
 The way of course, I don't know exactly what the work in course is.

0:39:06	SPEAKER_00
 But it's not that I don't care, but I don't understand.

0:39:10	SPEAKER_00
 I think the real point is when.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, I said at the beginning of the meeting that we're not roughly in it.

0:39:20	SPEAKER_00
 I don't say, well no, no, I don't want to put the deadline.

0:39:23	SPEAKER_00
 But given the current material we have, even your activities, because I know that you both are involved in many other things.

0:39:32	SPEAKER_00
 So it's something that you, as Mr. Mark said, it's Christmas and so we are happy with the Christmas gift.

0:39:39	SPEAKER_00
 Or it's something that you say is Christmas 2006.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_00
 So I definitely just want to know something very rough.

0:39:47	SPEAKER_00
 And when you expect to finish this.

0:39:52	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, the test of looking at there, if we go point by point.

0:40:00	SPEAKER_04
 So looking at there and score.

0:40:03	SPEAKER_05
 So you said you would look at this, right?

0:40:06	SPEAKER_05
 We would look both at this because we are also both quite busy with other projects.

0:40:13	SPEAKER_00
 Of course, what I just feel is the base.

0:40:16	SPEAKER_00
 That's the problem.

0:40:17	SPEAKER_00
 Do you think it's something for the very next month?

0:40:20	SPEAKER_05
 Do you think it's not for?

0:40:23	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, it's not for end of next year.

0:40:25	SPEAKER_01
 It's too long.

0:40:27	SPEAKER_00
 So it's too long?

0:40:29	SPEAKER_00
 So half next year?

0:40:33	SPEAKER_01
 For my session, I would like to say that up real may we should have results.

0:40:39	SPEAKER_00
 Results, what does it mean?

0:40:41	SPEAKER_00
 The end of this?

0:40:43	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:40:44	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, the...

0:40:48	SPEAKER_01
 It's not for the ready that we use.

0:40:50	SPEAKER_01
 Almost the complete application.

0:40:53	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe some minor change will appear.

0:40:56	SPEAKER_00
 For me, what is important is when it is ready to be used, when I can say start collecting data.

0:41:02	SPEAKER_00
 I start using, I start playing with this.

0:41:04	SPEAKER_00
 Basically, the process is ready and we can start having our demo.

0:41:08	SPEAKER_00
 Also because there is a risk that we submitted a project, maybe it will be rejected with a no.

0:41:13	SPEAKER_00
 But potentially, we are going to have a student supposed to work in this.

0:41:17	SPEAKER_00
 It will be no before April 2006 anyway.

0:41:22	SPEAKER_00
 But, you know, some way we cannot tell students and make them wait one year before he has the material to work.

0:41:33	SPEAKER_00
 So my point is when, reasonably, roughly, I don't know, and it's not that it lines away.

0:41:41	SPEAKER_00
 But when do you expect to have the system ready to work working?

0:41:46	SPEAKER_04
 Because, I mean, the IVC system, I mean, my feeling is that, I mean, people have expertise in this, like in free-bours.

0:41:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, they have.

0:41:55	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think it should take a lot of time.

0:41:57	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, just to look at this, right?

0:41:59	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, at least one month seems to be...

0:42:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but we start with the IVC.

0:42:05	SPEAKER_01
 We start with the data path, the slide, Frank Grabber.

0:42:10	SPEAKER_01
 And after that, the question is, how to synchronize, how to make both car working together.

0:42:18	SPEAKER_00
 Together.

0:42:19	SPEAKER_00
 So this seems to be the main problem as far as I understand.

0:42:22	SPEAKER_05
 So, yeah, let's see.

0:42:24	SPEAKER_05
 For checking down in the code, et cetera, we can expect it until...

0:42:31	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, for one month or so, then the IVC...

0:42:38	SPEAKER_01
 The people at free will have...

0:42:40	SPEAKER_05
 IVC should go faster.

0:42:42	SPEAKER_05
 So, because anyway, we see what you are working on, right?

0:42:46	SPEAKER_04
 We have the IVC, but using the signals that are coming...

0:42:50	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, basically it's...

0:42:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I'm not currently working on it.

0:42:53	SPEAKER_01
 I will start to work on January on that point.

0:42:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, and then...

0:42:58	SPEAKER_01
 But I think...

0:42:59	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so currently you are not working on this.

0:43:01	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, I'm not working.

0:43:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, then...

0:43:04	SPEAKER_01
 I scheduled to work on that.

0:43:07	SPEAKER_05
 So we can say we try to make something for April.

0:43:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:43:11	SPEAKER_01
 But I have...

0:43:12	SPEAKER_00
 You think something you are using, very vague expression or result...

0:43:15	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I want this to work for the time.

0:43:18	SPEAKER_00
 Just tell me when it is ready.

0:43:21	SPEAKER_00
 And if you think it's not before...

0:43:23	SPEAKER_00
 But must be reasonable, I mean...

0:43:26	SPEAKER_00
 If you think it will be not before December 2006, say December 2006, so don't try to tell me March or April...

0:43:35	SPEAKER_00
 If you already know that it is unrealistic to say that, it must be realistic, if you say June 2006, we know it is June 2006...

0:43:42	SPEAKER_01
 But I would like to say there is many unknown in that project.

0:43:46	SPEAKER_01
 I know.

0:43:47	SPEAKER_01
 I would like to say we can make a schedule for that project...

0:43:50	SPEAKER_01
 Of course.

0:43:51	SPEAKER_01
 To just to see if we track the timetable.

0:43:54	SPEAKER_01
 If we don't, we ask for more people, maybe HEVS people, to be slightly involved in that project...

0:44:01	SPEAKER_01
 Once you don't...

0:44:02	SPEAKER_00
 To respect the date.

0:44:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:44:04	SPEAKER_00
 There is no date to respect this.

0:44:06	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know. I mean, if you can have early warnings in the Senate, if you see that there is a major problem somewhere.

0:44:14	SPEAKER_00
 But it's just to know, in the sense that really...

0:44:18	SPEAKER_00
 This thing has been stopped now for quite a long time.

0:44:22	SPEAKER_00
 It took a long time to decide what kind of material.

0:44:26	SPEAKER_00
 Now we have it.

0:44:27	SPEAKER_00
 It's something that is a pretty good idea.

0:44:31	SPEAKER_00
 We see that other people are working, etc.

0:44:33	SPEAKER_00
 We are going to lose it some way.

0:44:36	SPEAKER_04
 That's one of the issues.

0:44:39	SPEAKER_04
 And very honestly...

0:44:41	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know whether you realize this.

0:44:45	SPEAKER_04
 But of course, if we have this in two years, maybe okay, it's good, we have it.

0:44:49	SPEAKER_04
 But of course, it's on a different level of research.

0:44:52	SPEAKER_04
 In terms of research, maybe even in terms of innovation.

0:44:56	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, if you think about this, which is what they said, I mean, speaking about innovation, this is probably one innovation.

0:45:04	SPEAKER_04
 We see quite well why FxPAL is working on this, right?

0:45:09	SPEAKER_04
 But in two years, if we want to build a CTI or transfer technology and something like this, maybe of course, okay, people will say, yeah, but there is already something that people have started to put on the market and so on.

0:45:24	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe it's too late to do it.

0:45:28	SPEAKER_04
 So I think this is really one of the points with respect to research.

0:45:33	SPEAKER_04
 Of course, I think it's going to appear more and more and more.

0:45:38	SPEAKER_00
 In a sense, I never tried, for example, eventually to ask for one person dedicated to this, because I always said the feeling that you are very interested, you wanted to do it.

0:45:47	SPEAKER_00
 It's something new, something that is interesting to you.

0:45:53	SPEAKER_00
 But if you have no time and the possibility that you are both involved in many other things, we can eventually try to ask to have one person, to involve one person that will be dedicated strictly to this.

0:46:06	SPEAKER_00
 We can try, I mean, we can ask in the sense that if it is a priority for idiots, so far we will get very good signals from that point of view.

0:46:14	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:46:15	SPEAKER_00
 But please, if you think you don't have the time or the energy to do it, it involves too many things that you cannot keep under control, given the other things you have to do.

0:46:27	SPEAKER_00
 Don't think that, okay, something nice, we can wait, or sooner or later it's going to happen.

0:46:32	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, we just can't wait.

0:46:33	SPEAKER_05
 We were here one year ago, I don't know, also when it was...

0:46:38	SPEAKER_00
 So I think it's the moment for you to really realize, try to have a realistic date.

0:46:44	SPEAKER_00
 And if you think there are too many things that you risk to lose control, tell it now, and we can try to say, well, we want to do it, but basically in my head, and all of you...

0:46:57	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, that's not only I want to be involved in that project.

0:47:00	SPEAKER_00
 But you can be involved in a different way.

0:47:02	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, you can eventually have a supervision role, and the sad that you think, I know how to do it, I like to do it, but I have no time, because at a certain point is a matter of time, we can try to ask.

0:47:15	SPEAKER_00
 But please just don't keep this as a kind of thing, I like to do it, I like it, it's nice, etc.

0:47:21	SPEAKER_04
 Because when you say here now, okay, no, I'm not going to start working on this before January, for me it surprises me to some extent, you know.

0:47:28	SPEAKER_04
 I thought, I mean, you would be working on this, so if you say...

0:47:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but at the same time I have some other project, I want to finish those projects first.

0:47:38	SPEAKER_00
 But here you have to take responsibility, you can say I like to do it, but then I will do it when I can...

0:47:44	SPEAKER_04
 But the point is that Olivier, you have, I mean, since one year, you have always been saying that you want to be involved in this and so on, so it seems that it has never been a priority, so that's the point.

0:47:54	SPEAKER_04
 So if you have no time to put priority at some point, and this seems to have been the case during one year on this project, I mean, you need to say now.

0:48:04	SPEAKER_01
 But for example, I received some new project, I said that I have no time yet, I say I have no time, now currently, I say for some project you say that you don't have time, but people will continue to say, no, no, you will find time, just to do with that project.

0:48:24	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so now is your responsibility to say I cannot find time.

0:48:28	SPEAKER_00
 If you can't find time, you have to say it now, this is possible.

0:48:32	SPEAKER_03
 At least it's obvious to us, and we see it's not an accusation, we are all in the same condition.

0:48:36	SPEAKER_04
 Again, and this is a question.

0:48:37	SPEAKER_04
 How are you saying you have no time? So now you say it to us, so now we understand, and maybe after, if we discuss with Frank, Frank, from us, and we'll see, okay, and go, and try to see, okay, apparently he has no time to work on this, so we think it's important and we'd like to do something.

0:48:58	SPEAKER_04
 So what kind of solution has that essential momentum?

0:49:00	SPEAKER_04
 Do we need to take somebody, do we want to take some intern to work on this, and so on and so on?

0:49:07	SPEAKER_04
 Do we take to have somebody contract, even if it's not an intern, but take somebody for six months to work on this?

0:49:14	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, but so this is a point, I mean, I don't know about the other projects you have to do, I don't know if you are discussing about the time you can spend on each of the projects, but if, because now you are just telling us you have no time, indeed, to work on this, right?

0:49:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, okay.

0:49:33	SPEAKER_04
 So, so...

0:49:34	SPEAKER_01
 Currently, but...

0:49:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but I mean...

0:49:36	SPEAKER_01
 Up to December, I don't have time to work on it, but I plan already, I...

0:49:41	SPEAKER_01
 With IM2, I...

0:49:42	SPEAKER_01
 With IM2, I did, I mentioned that I will have from January 2006, I will have time for that.

0:49:50	SPEAKER_01
 I have a...

0:49:51	SPEAKER_05
 It was on IM2, I see.

0:49:54	SPEAKER_01
 Now, I will work fully on that, on this point, from January 2006.

0:49:59	SPEAKER_01
 I wish...

0:50:00	SPEAKER_05
 It was 50%, no, on IM2, IP1, okay, maybe an 50% on that.

0:50:05	SPEAKER_00
 So, let me post a question very brutally.

0:50:07	SPEAKER_00
 Do you think that to have a person that does this will help you?

0:50:14	SPEAKER_00
 We can ask, we can try to ask, maybe have some person for six months, so that your role is simply to help and advise.

0:50:23	SPEAKER_05
 Well, this was...

0:50:25	SPEAKER_05
 I don't want to talk too much, maybe, with Sebastian, so this was maybe his concern.

0:50:34	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, Sebastian is busy with annotations, all kind of things.

0:50:40	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe we can...

0:50:43	SPEAKER_05
 I think...

0:50:44	SPEAKER_05
 In the process, we can ask for...

0:50:47	SPEAKER_05
 Someone more?

0:50:51	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe a good thing will be to make a plan, to say.

0:50:56	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's what I...

0:50:57	SPEAKER_01
 We answer the deadline here, we are here, we split that part in different seconds.

0:51:03	SPEAKER_05
 That's what I was trying to do, and I, before coming here, I just tried to make a...

0:51:08	SPEAKER_05
 I'm sorry, but you still don't answer to my question.

0:51:11	SPEAKER_00
 But I don't answer, yeah.

0:51:12	SPEAKER_00
 You are not answering my question.

0:51:14	SPEAKER_05
 Let's say April, 06, and we do our best with trying to keep you informed about the advancements.

0:51:23	SPEAKER_05
 And if we see early, that clearly...

0:51:27	SPEAKER_00
 Let me pause again the question very clearly.

0:51:29	SPEAKER_00
 If I go to Erve, I can try and say, we are in this situation, apparently.

0:51:34	SPEAKER_00
 Why don't we take one person, three months, six months, four months, that directly advise by earlier, and we can speak up.

0:51:44	SPEAKER_05
 And we can speak with experience in C++ MFC.

0:51:48	SPEAKER_00
 Consider that it can be difficult, of course, to find an acceptor.

0:51:52	SPEAKER_00
 Do you think it's an option?

0:51:54	SPEAKER_04
 You have people that are aware of MFC, I mean, people that suppose that it's UV, or something else.

0:52:01	SPEAKER_03
 A teacher, you think there are people?

0:52:02	SPEAKER_04
 Why wasn't it a mind, the UV?

0:52:04	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, there would be, obviously, some students that would be aware of, and that could be able to handle this.

0:52:12	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, you're working with software and both of us, software and our way.

0:52:15	SPEAKER_00
 Do you think it's a reasonable option?

0:52:17	SPEAKER_00
 Do you think it's something that can help you?

0:52:20	SPEAKER_00
 Because that's just a matter of responsibility for you guys to...

0:52:24	SPEAKER_00
 There is nothing bad if you say have other things to do, because we are all full of work.

0:52:28	SPEAKER_00
 This is something that is added on the top.

0:52:31	SPEAKER_00
 If you don't have time, you don't have time, guys.

0:52:34	SPEAKER_00
 But please, just tell me, we will find the time, however, so April 6, you will have your system.

0:52:43	SPEAKER_00
 Or, no, we are not sure.

0:52:45	SPEAKER_00
 We don't really know.

0:52:47	SPEAKER_00
 It can happen that we don't.

0:52:49	SPEAKER_00
 We don't know what we are going to find on the way.

0:52:51	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we think it takes one week and then it takes one month, we don't know.

0:52:55	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we will not able to be continuous, because one of the longest thing is to work one week, then one month, no, etc. It's something that breaks, it's difficult.

0:53:05	SPEAKER_00
 That's a point.

0:53:07	SPEAKER_00
 So, which doesn't mean you are excluded from the thing.

0:53:10	SPEAKER_00
 In the sense that in the case someone will have to advise the person eventually.

0:53:15	SPEAKER_00
 It can't be him, it can't be me, it can be you that basically follow, advise, help, but at least the mass of the work will be done by someone else that can spend 100% of time on that.

0:53:29	SPEAKER_00
 Now, it's not even guaranteed in the sense that I can ask this.

0:53:33	SPEAKER_00
 I can say that this is the situation and you are.

0:53:39	SPEAKER_00
 Or eventually, yes, someone can say, okay, now this become your priority, forget about everything else and go with that.

0:53:45	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:53:46	SPEAKER_00
 Or we'll tell you, okay, January 2006, but from January 2006 you do not understand this.

0:53:53	SPEAKER_00
 We can find the time, whether it is your time, whether it is the time of someone else.

0:53:58	SPEAKER_00
 But I really would like to stop with this because this has been for several months that you say we like, we want, and I'm sure, I believe you.

0:54:07	SPEAKER_00
 But then it is always something that must be done outside the normal activity.

0:54:14	SPEAKER_00
 Which is really bad.

0:54:15	SPEAKER_00
 I understand exactly.

0:54:17	SPEAKER_00
 Otherwise, I mean, as I say, to do it in two years.

0:54:23	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:54:25	SPEAKER_00
 So what do you think? You like to try to solve this problem and try to say that there is a time problem and you don't have the time to do it?

0:54:35	SPEAKER_04
 Because so Olivier says it's not before January on his side, so I'm not sure about it on your side.

0:54:42	SPEAKER_05
 What I would like to work on part-time one day a week.

0:54:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:54:49	SPEAKER_05
 And one full day a week.

0:54:55	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, maybe you want my own server, but I would say that we start, but we really have to start working, reading all the code from Davin.

0:55:08	SPEAKER_05
 And then we try this card with the code, IVC card to try this.

0:55:21	SPEAKER_05
 Then we try a little bit direct show to see to have an idea of how long that could be.

0:55:26	SPEAKER_05
 And then at the moment we can say, okay, we need someone to help us.

0:55:30	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:55:31	SPEAKER_00
 That's going to be.

0:55:32	SPEAKER_01
 I think that would be good just to have a plan and to have some deadline in that plan.

0:55:38	SPEAKER_01
 As soon as we are not in time, we will have several issues.

0:55:44	SPEAKER_04
 I would say like if there would be a machine like this with the two cards separated as I mentioned.

0:55:48	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, if we record the flow of the video, for instance, and the snapshots from the slides to some extent, there is some possibility of doing some automatic alignment without having a special synchronous.

0:55:59	SPEAKER_04
 So this means that to some extent we could have a device which would not yet be fully synchronized.

0:56:05	SPEAKER_04
 And I don't know if we've very well done code in terms of signing signals and so on.

0:56:11	SPEAKER_04
 But that might be sufficient because it's synchronized up to five seconds.

0:56:18	SPEAKER_04
 And you would say five seconds, my sim a lot for you and video, but maybe with respect to slides and the rest is something that might be terrible.

0:56:27	SPEAKER_04
 So still we would be able to start doing some recordings and maybe doing even the automatic alignment or at least we would have an idea about what are the problems in terms of alignments.

0:56:38	SPEAKER_04
 Because it's not like with microphone arrays where you need microsecond alignments, of course.

0:56:44	SPEAKER_04
 Or even maybe we will have video where it might be one or two frames.

0:56:48	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:56:49	SPEAKER_04
 So this is really somehow, I mean, the issue.

0:56:53	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I'm sure that there are plenty of possibilities to do things.

0:56:57	SPEAKER_04
 And the goal would be that indeed we could start doing some of the recordings of the time.

0:57:04	SPEAKER_04
 So that we would have something where we could start getting the data.

0:57:12	SPEAKER_04
 Because after, I mean, even if it's there, we cannot put all the times in one week.

0:57:16	SPEAKER_04
 So I mean, this is one of the issues as well, which is to have it so that we can play and we can make a nice demo and so on with the full thing and something.

0:57:29	SPEAKER_04
 So the other part is to have a system from which we can already record data and with some approximations.

0:57:36	SPEAKER_04
 And I have the feeling, given the descriptions that you made, that to have such a system wouldn't require six months of work.

0:57:43	SPEAKER_04
 Because basically, there are not codes in there to some extent.

0:57:47	SPEAKER_04
 And the IVC is something quite standard from which we could ask, I mean, even we could even pay maybe pro.

0:57:53	SPEAKER_04
 Some people from Fribbo, I don't know, I have to come here and to help us with installation on a computer.

0:58:00	SPEAKER_04
 And to get the, so I have more of the feelings that we see, something that could be done almost in one month.

0:58:08	SPEAKER_04
 Again, I'm not speaking about the synchronization, I mean, without the actual, you mean, the functional and time alignment?

0:58:16	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, yeah.

0:58:17	SPEAKER_05
 That would be done in like in common software that we have.

0:58:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, for instance, after all, a simple question, maybe can, are we sure that it can work on a single computer?

0:58:29	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:58:31	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, I mean, this is about testing and services.

0:58:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, okay.

0:58:40	SPEAKER_04
 So it doesn't require, it's more testing, it does not require so for this, I mean, if you put the two cards on the computer, you put the two, then you, basically, you say play on both sides, and you look whether at the end, you have a record of signals, which is a time that it should not be.

0:58:56	SPEAKER_04
 And, or whether I mean the fact that whenever I mean the slides is doing some processing, it is some burden, there is some frame drops.

0:59:05	SPEAKER_05
 So you could say, okay, let's for Christmas, let's try this, without the, all the synchronization with the actual issue.

0:59:14	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, oh yeah, you cannot, oh, by doing one day a week, you know, just testing the cards.

0:59:24	SPEAKER_01
 It seems to me clear, until January, if I, if I say, in January, this is just to finish, I want to have the deadline at, and of December to finish all my projects, I want to finish all this project when everything is finished.

0:59:39	SPEAKER_01
 So, just to conclude, I can move to another one.

0:59:42	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't want to.

0:59:44	SPEAKER_00
 So you can't work.

0:59:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's not really, can't work until January.

0:59:48	SPEAKER_00
 So I try my best.

0:59:50	SPEAKER_00
 It's up to you.

0:59:51	SPEAKER_00
 Until January.

0:59:52	SPEAKER_05
 And, and I try to do what Jamak described, to give you a first feedback on the different cards.

1:00:02	SPEAKER_05
 And, and from there, yeah.

1:00:09	SPEAKER_00
 And then we make a decision in a sense, whether you continue working or we try to find a time in a different way, or we try to eliminate your other priorities.

1:00:20	SPEAKER_04
 So we're under.

1:00:22	SPEAKER_04
 I'm wondering whether or still we could ask for to get an intern for this.

1:00:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:00:26	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know regarding HEVS.

1:00:29	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if this is still in time, but you can have, you can ask for students.

1:00:36	SPEAKER_01
 Deeplma work.

1:00:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, this is still even, even the non-diploma work.

1:00:43	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I think that's different.

1:00:46	SPEAKER_00
 That's different, but it's really up to you guys, whether you think it's good to have one person try to have it, because I can say we have tried to have.

1:00:57	SPEAKER_05
 I would say, yeah, let's try to have one student to help us on that.

1:01:03	SPEAKER_05
 That is very, well, we have to choose whether the students, it's a bit, but the student should have knowledge about MFC.

1:01:11	SPEAKER_00
 Better not person, then a bad person anyway.

1:01:16	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

1:01:18	SPEAKER_05
 It doesn't mean that we have to.

1:01:21	SPEAKER_05
 The recording is finished.

1:01:24	SPEAKER_01
 That's your idea, as a result.
