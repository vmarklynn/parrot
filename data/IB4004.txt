0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 Hello, these are sixest microphones. They are made for women's shirts.

0:00:08	SPEAKER_03
 No, mine's the opposite.

0:00:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so let's start.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_03
 Thanks for coming again to this meeting. I hope it won't be too long, and especially that we'll make some progress on this small task that is putting people in our new rooms. I hope you had fun in designing something or asking the people about their preferences and things like this.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_03
 So, yeah, that's what I was talking about. It's for women's shirts.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_03
 So, well, I think you remember all the constraints and the new settings.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_03
 I think you'll be more and more used to it as soon as we move.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_03
 So, we have these one person, two person, and three person rooms.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_03
 And so, that makes, I think, 18 places.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_03
 And we had about 15 people and some spare working places to put.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_03
 May I first provide the answers to the questions from the last time?

0:01:15	SPEAKER_05
 And I also checked with Maggie and Peric.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, great. So, that will be part of your solution or suggestions to solution.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_03
 But regarding the constraints, there is no immediate plan to make separations between the rooms. So, that means basically what we have to do with this setting. It's quite difficult to make new doors and new walls.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think we should count on them in the next four years, maybe.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_03
 And they don't want us to, I mean, they don't want to provide an extra working space for Gisela with the other Etihad means, which we could understand because it's sort of full of it there.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_03
 But at least that's what they saw. It's not full over there.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_03
 So, it seems we, yeah, there, well, we cannot change the habits of the whole school just for us.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_03
 Though it wouldn't be a bad thing, maybe. But we'll see.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_03
 So, regarding the possibilities of the four people in one of the two or three-person rooms, well, it's not very easy. We'll have to play quite wisely with the furnishing.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_03
 It looks like it's not impossible, at least on the one that is a bit longer on the right.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_03
 So, on the one here, it should be possible to put four persons.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_03
 If we could avoid it, it would much simplify things.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_04
 The question is, is it against the regulation, security regulation of the school?

0:02:46	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, no.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_05
 And I went over and I looked at that room too. There's plenty of space for four people.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think it's more a matter of how to arrange the furniture, but since we're experts at this task.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so maybe we could count on four places.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_03
 But the final decision is not really ours, so we'll see actually.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_01
 It would be fine if one of the persons is 50% for me, for example.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_03
 Exactly, or one of the intern positions, the people who might come.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_03
 Exactly.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_03
 Something like that.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so these were the answers.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_03
 So, actually, I did my proposal as a slide. Would you like me to start or would you like me to end?

0:03:29	SPEAKER_05
 Just to complete, I talked both with Maggie and Pat and both of them were happy to share offices.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_05
 They have no problem with something.

0:03:39	None
 They're easy, but it could be, as Pierre- has right now, that she's happy to continue to share with the Marianne.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_05
 And Maggie, for example, could be with Bruno because they work on the Swiss thread together and they like to gossip together.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_05
 Beautiful.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, then let me explain very briefly the rationale for this.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_03
 So it's the same schema that you know.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_03
 In red you have the, oh, excuse me, that's quite annoying.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_03
 Excuse me.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_03
 Hello.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_03
 Can I call you a bit later in about half an hour?

0:04:20	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just in the middle of a meeting and I'm talking.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_05
 Fantastic.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, okay.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you. Bye-bye.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_00
 Check that thing.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry for this.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_03
 Fortunately, we're just the four of us.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so let me get back to the proposal after a brief interruption.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_03
 So the names are in red.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_03
 Now, well, one of the reasons, at least for me, for doing this was to more or less group people within projects because I think that sometimes they just discuss together and it's easier if they're in the same office.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_03
 And, which is quite happy actually, I also thought that some professors might enjoy or at least don't say anything about being with their assistants.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_03
 So I was happy to hear Susan saying that Maggie and Bruno could go on well together and Pierre-Ette and Marianne in the same office.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_03
 So what I can say is that I also understood that Susan would be rather in favor of having her own office, so it's working like this.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_03
 I put the lounge in the middle.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_03
 It's also one of the rooms with the fewest windows.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_03
 So I think that's not a problem because you're not going to just stay there and stare outside, but it's nicer to have a nicer view from your office, I guess.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_04
 Putting the printer in the lounge is just killing the lounge.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know, yeah, maybe I thought in an angle, but that's obviously not a very question of you are printing all the time.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, why not put the printer out in the hallway?

0:06:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so next to the photocopy, maybe it wouldn't be a bad place here.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_05
 Is there any space there for photocopy and printer?

0:06:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we'll have to check.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_03
 The photocopy is a bit big.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but the printer is quite small if we find just a small table for it.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe one day we'll have a photocopy that is also a printer.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, but I wouldn't, well, insist on this.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_03
 I think, okay, so the printer will remove it if we work from this solution.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_03
 So IM2 is more or less in the upper left side.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_03
 I said more or less.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_03
 Upper lower left side, you have Swiss tran and Parmenides, so the two projects from the list.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_03
 And then Metas L.T. on the right side.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe not a very good solution for GZL.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_03
 If you can suggest something better because she's with two people who, well, two PhD students, and it's true that she has a lot of phone calls to make.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_03
 But it's some way to solve some constraints.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_03
 I think this is a very open thing.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_03
 If you want, we can use this document or we could just, say, first listen to your suggestions and see if we erase everything or just do some modifications using this one.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_05
 I have a question.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_05
 What's the justification for giving Nancy her own office?

0:07:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, maybe not a very strong one, and maybe you have better suggestions.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_03
 It was, I think, sort of one of the places that remain. I think, yeah, there is no strong constraint.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_03
 Well, she's a smoker, but the policy is that we don't smoke, so it's even better if she's with a second person.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_04
 I would have a provocative suggestion to put GZL to switch Nancy and GZL.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_02
 Uh-huh.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_04
 GZL had the facts on the printing machine, the printer, in the one person.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_05
 Well, GZL, we'll not be very happy about that.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_05
 We tried that, and GZL really didn't like to have the printer in people in and out all the time.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_04
 The printer, that's not the hard constraint.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_03
 I remember Andrei, that was it.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that was the case, and Ash was a bit...

0:08:15	SPEAKER_04
 Because I really do think it's important to have an admin room, really identified as an admin room, and only an admin room.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we could store files there.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_04
 Or anything like that.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_04
 If you want, I can already do this change here against the fact that my personal files are in a room that is not specifically dedicated for that.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_01
 You're a professional printer, or there's only one printer.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_01
 Because if not the printer can go in a room of three people.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_01
 That's typical of the case where there's a lab and the printer is there.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_04
 The printer can be in the printer.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the printer is, yeah, it's the main one.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_03
 We have a secondary one, which we could try to accommodate in another room, but it's basically the printer where everybody prints.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_03
 So I changed this.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe I would suggest... can I hear also... let us hear from you?

0:09:21	SPEAKER_03
 And then if we can work out a common solution from this one, then we go back to this slide.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_03
 And if not, we'll just start from scratch.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_04
 Perfect, all right, to share the room with you is a view on the old town.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_04
 I could be aware of what I was saying last time, that you have to suffer some calls.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_04
 So if I'm from phone calls.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I'll try, I'll bring my walk in.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's...

0:09:52	SPEAKER_05
 Your plugs, whatever.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_03
 David, you had also...

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay, for me, as a... I don't know the people a lot.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_01
 I just suggested that there's a lack of men. So I would certainly put not two men in the same office.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_01
 I would try to share them with the women.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_01
 So for example, in your slide, I would switch either you or Martin with the other room, this one.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_03
 Uh-huh.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, let me put the plan. Sorry, I will display... Yeah, this is the MT1.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_03
 I don't want to influence here.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_03
 So you would put...

0:10:36	SPEAKER_05
 So we have to show us which one you were talking about, David. We didn't know.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I was wanting to change this...

0:10:42	SPEAKER_01
 The center room.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_03
 You can even stand and just show us that.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but I need your... your slide because I was talking about your slide.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so you would prefer the names.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, I didn't want to influence you too much, but I'm perfectly happy to start with this as a basis and then change things.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because there are plenty of things at times.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, so here you can see the many...

0:11:06	SPEAKER_01
 The many, I mean, there are always sharing the room with...

0:11:10	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, just Bruno, me, Viet, and Nico's is a guy also.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_04
 But for Perit and Maggie, it's a will.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_04
 It's a wish or it's...

0:11:22	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, actually, because...

0:11:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I had this woman too.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry, but...

0:11:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's the feminine of Pierre.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_01
 So, I mean, this is perfectly fine. We just changed Martin and Andre for Mario, or Yolena, or Nancy.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_04
 So...

0:11:37	SPEAKER_04
 He didn't get your solution?

0:11:38	SPEAKER_04
 What was it again?

0:11:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, here there are two men.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_01
 So, I mean...

0:11:42	SPEAKER_05
 What's the mixed sexist?

0:11:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's nice. I don't think so.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, there's a lack of men here in this... in this lab.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_01
 So, I would change one.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_01
 Switch one.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_04
 But it's not so much a question of men or women. It's more the question of, as I said, that's...

0:12:02	SPEAKER_04
 Here you have only... you have PhD students that are regroup.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_04
 There you have senior researchers that are regroup, which is to me more...

0:12:11	SPEAKER_04
 Unless it corresponds to some specific demand, like if there's in the case in Maggie's case and Pierre's case, I think that's a very efficient way of doing things.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and for me, it's also... I would prefer maybe not to be in a three-person office, just to be...

0:12:27	SPEAKER_03
 I'm perfectly happy with you.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_03
 I'm very happy with you.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_00
 I'm very happy with you.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_03
 I'll propose this.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_03
 But I could also be happy with most of the other people.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_03
 So, even in a three-person room, it's fine.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so let's keep in mind maybe this constraint of balancing the genders.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_03
 We'll see if we can do something for it.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_05
 Andre, did you ask these people if this was okay with them?

0:12:53	SPEAKER_03
 I've asked some of them, and I've also used a little bit what I've...

0:12:58	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I mean, the present arrangement, just not to shock people too much.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_03
 And it's also people that I know get on well, quite well together, and also work on the same project, like, for instance, Marianne, the Finnish Marianne, and Nikos, who interact quite a lot on...

0:13:18	SPEAKER_03
 on Met SLT.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, Maria and Yalina seem to go on one quite well.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_03
 Nancy had no strong preference, especially since she's no longer allowed to smoke in her office.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so I think, well, at least as far as I asked, there was no major objection.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_04
 But isn't there just a question of proximity you put David with, Anes?

0:13:48	SPEAKER_04
 Isn't Anes working in a more substantial way with people like either Maria or Yalina?

0:14:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's true.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_03
 That's true.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_03
 So we could put Nancy with David and put...

0:14:13	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but Agnes is also working with David, so...

0:14:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but we read that it's not important to share the room with someone that has the same project.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_04
 No, that's true.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_04
 Here, the other constraints are satisfied somehow.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:14:27	SPEAKER_01
 And Marova and I will be quite happy to have the full room, some 50% of the time.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's a small advantage, and it's a bit more comfortable, actually.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_04
 So what I mean is with the two, three person rooms, I think that they can mix them the way they want.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, if they prefer to be Maria, Yalina, Nikos and Nancy and Maria on the other side, well, no, that's not completely equivalent, because Nancy, all our PhD students or Master's students, but Nancy, correct?

0:14:58	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but that doesn't matter.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_05
 That's not important.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_05
 One question I was wondering about though, because three is always a...

0:15:09	SPEAKER_05
 Well, the more people in an office, the less ideal, that when it may be better to put David in since he's only half-time.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_05
 So that way, then there's not three people all the time.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_04
 So I would switch David and Nancy, typically.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, probably.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_04
 Which is the way that David should be in this room, could be in the other one.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_04
 For me, the two, three people rooms are really, they have to be reshuffled according to people's personal preferences.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_04
 So I definitely would have answered...

0:15:37	SPEAKER_04
 What does Nancy need with Agnes in the two-person room?

0:15:41	SPEAKER_03
 They have worked together on Permany, so this makes some sense.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_03
 But again, it's also a question of personal preference.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, you can't be a room or a person you don't want to be with.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, as far as I know, I think it's probably quite a good path.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_01
 Is there anyone that you're going to finish?

0:15:59	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_05
 First one should be Maria, but it's still one and a half.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, let's switch.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_04
 If you do this way, in the two, three people room, there will be one that is not so overloaded because of David.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_04
 Because David will be part-time, and the other one is not so overloaded because there is one free position.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_04
 Knowing that this one free position will not stay free very long.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_05
 No, because don't forget, we already have somebody coming in January.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_05
 At least one person.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_04
 This is still a worry for me because we don't still don't have enough space for the visitors.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_04
 At least we put them in the lounge.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I don't have enough space for them.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, yeah.

0:16:49	None
 Yeah.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_04
 We need to have at least three visitors' positions.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so since we're supposed to do a final proposal, sorry, let me move the printer next to the photocopier.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, and we'll find some way to attach it to a wall or something like this.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_03
 So that we keep it.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think so.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so that's the...

0:17:22	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think we can put visitors in the lounge.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_04
 It depends on how we think about the lounge.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_04
 If it's thought as being a reading group.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_04
 No, if it's thought as...

0:17:33	SPEAKER_04
 That's really a very important question to me.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_04
 Do we put priority on the fact of being able to read newspapers in our offices or in our workplace?

0:17:44	SPEAKER_04
 We can read newspapers elsewhere.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_04
 And I really do think it's more important for a lab to be able to decently welcome visitors that come to the lab than to have a place for reading newspapers.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_04
 Newspapers, you can read them home.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_04
 You can go to the cafeteria or you can sit somewhere else.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_04
 You can go on the balcony if it's in the summer.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_04
 So I don't understand why we should put priority on lounges if we don't have enough space for accommodating visitors.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_04
 That's just not according to my priorities.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_03
 How would it be to put the lounge in one of the smaller offices in one of the one person offices?

0:18:23	SPEAKER_03
 I know they are actually quite demanded.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_03
 I think Susan, you're very happy with this solution.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_04
 Let's put the lounge in Susan's lounge with three visitors.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_04
 That's an extraordinary...

0:18:38	SPEAKER_01
 The large in one person room is really too small.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's probably too small.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't work.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_04
 I would advocate to just remove the lounge.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_04
 It's a luxury for us.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_04
 We don't have space for a lounge.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_04
 Let's be...

0:18:50	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, let's be innovative.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_04
 In front of your colleagues in saying, if I have to choose between reading my newspaper and having a decently welcomed research visitor, I prefer to read my newspapers.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_04
 That's just not realistic.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_04
 But we are researchers.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_03
 The problem is it has been decided by everyone and approved by the school that we need the lounge.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's simply not...

0:19:16	SPEAKER_01
 No, I don't think we can choose about it.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_03
 No, actually, I'm sorry.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_04
 Then we have the three people room that were in three positions, split it in two parts as Susan was proposing.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_04
 Last time was a wall and you have a lounge there.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_04
 We can read your newspapers and we have a full two-person room where we can certainly accommodate three visitors.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_04
 At least we have some free margin for the next two years.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so how do we split the room?

0:19:46	SPEAKER_05
 We put in three people.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_05
 The furniture that we got for our reading room, we put it into the other half of the three-person room.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_05
 Would that fit?

0:19:57	SPEAKER_05
 A little divider of some kind.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_03
 But what about if people want to have a small discussion in the lounge?

0:20:02	SPEAKER_04
 They are not supposed to have a discussion in the lounge.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_04
 They are supposed to read their newspapers.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_04
 Well, not the newspapers because...

0:20:08	SPEAKER_03
 No, scientific articles.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_03
 No, that's not the goal.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_04
 The goal of the lounge was a place where you can relax.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_04
 They also have to read articles.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_04
 At least you can do it in your office.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_03
 So you would like to put it with...

0:20:25	SPEAKER_03
 And then who...

0:20:27	SPEAKER_04
 You have good chairs to read newspapers that you don't want to break your heart, your backways in your office.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay, but then that means that we'll put the lounge on the right side here.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_03
 And here we'll put two places for visitors.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_03
 Three.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_03
 Three, but that means the office will be, at least for the moment, empty.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_03
 That looks very bad.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_04
 No, I have a visitor that is arriving.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_04
 What did you say to us?

0:20:51	SPEAKER_04
 It's not a visitor.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_05
 It's a new full-time person arriving in January.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so that could take the free place over there.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_03
 No, I'm going to put the lounge.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_04
 That could take one position in the...

0:21:05	SPEAKER_01
 Let's put Maria or Yelena in this place.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think...

0:21:11	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so we need two free positions and one new person arriving, X or something like that.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_04
 That's an idea.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, if you forget about the lounge, what you could do is to move either Maria or Yelena in the...

0:21:27	SPEAKER_04
...what is currently the lounge.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_04
 That means that we have one person there with one free position.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_04
 We have one free position in the room that Maria or Yelena is coming from, and one free position over there.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_04
 So we have three positions distributed over the rooms.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_03
 Then where's the lounge?

0:21:48	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no, we can't...

0:21:50	SPEAKER_03
 I'll have my head cut off if we don't have a lounge.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_04
 So, of the lounge and you put it in the corridor.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_03
 Let's do the lounge corner.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_03
 The lounge is in the free space.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_03
 At least.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_03
 Otherwise, I cannot really defend it because it was agreed and we cannot just come back on every...

0:22:08	SPEAKER_05
 After all that we went through to get the budget for it.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I think so.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_04
 I think we have to explain to your visitors that unfortunately they have a position in the toilet because there is a reading room where people have to read.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_03
 Let's have the visitors first.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so what we need is a new and two frees.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think we can put what, Maria or Yelena.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_03
 I don't want to separate them really, but...

0:22:36	SPEAKER_03
 Or myself.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_03
 I don't like that office actually.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_03
 So I was thinking to put here...

0:22:43	SPEAKER_04
 It could be Nico's place.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_04
 You could switch.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_05
 No, we're not going to keep Maria in a three person place.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_05
 Just having Maria in the lounge.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, no, yeah.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_03
 So it's either...

0:22:57	SPEAKER_03
 We could put a visitor with you, Martin, but it's probably...

0:23:00	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, let's try this.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_03
 Let's try Maria here.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, Andre.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, you don't mind?

0:23:07	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_04
 Because I will be there half time.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_04
 Perfect.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_04
 And the visitors probably will not so much complain about the lounge.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_05
 Wait a minute.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_05
 Andre has a two person office all for himself.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, we'll put a visitor place in there.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_03
 If you don't mind.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_04
 Well, there is this full time person arriving.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's really important to plan with that.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_05
 What's her name again, Andre?

0:23:28	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's Paola.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_03
 Paola.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_04
 Would it be possible to have Paola in your office?

0:23:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it could be.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_04
 Because that's something that we should be deciding.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_04
 Either you want to keep me in your office, which is all right.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_04
 And then I would prefer you, I think.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_04
 It's not really...

0:23:45	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_04
 Let me keep you.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_05
 Martin goes back to Andre.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, we'll put Paola in the visitor here.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_03
 So, Paola is the new person.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_03
 And the visitor.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_03
 That's the one.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_03
 Is that this one?

0:24:04	SPEAKER_03
 And then we'll still have probably some way to put a second visitor here, a visitor here, a visitor here.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_03
 Oops.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_03
 It's not very nice, but does this display better?

0:24:20	SPEAKER_05
 I think I...

0:24:27	SPEAKER_05
 Well, no, but Paola being new, I think you can try to put your loan.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, not with her.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_00
 Somebody else.

0:24:32	None
 Uh-huh.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the lunch cannot be shared with two people.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_01
 You cannot go there and discuss and two people working there in the room.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_01
 No, but we said that we won't discuss.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_03
 Or maybe if we organize some kind of coffee at the end of the day or drink, then the two people will stop working.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know, maybe they won't be happy.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, then Martin, let me put you in that office and I'll put Paola with me.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_05
 No, no, no, no.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_05
 Why not Maria or Yelena?

0:25:02	SPEAKER_03
 So, Martin goes where?

0:25:04	SPEAKER_05
 Martin stays.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because you don't want to separate Maria and Yelena.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, okay.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_04
 It's not even sure she stays.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's true.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so let's put Maria in the separate office.

0:25:16	None
 Yeah.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_04
 And we have, yeah, and we have two visitors and a master student and a...

0:25:21	SPEAKER_04
 And we have...

0:25:23	SPEAKER_04
 Paola.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_04
 I was thinking the other way around.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, sorry.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_03
 What very thing?

0:25:28	SPEAKER_04
 Paola with Maria in the two people room and to have this one, this two, Yelena and David in the three people room.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_03
 So, who is with Maria here?

0:25:39	SPEAKER_03
 Paola.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and no visitor?

0:25:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_04
 That's the two people room.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but that means that this room, the middle one, would be quite empty.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_03
 All the time.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, two visitors and a 50% person.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think it's very reasonable.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_03
 What do you need to have to visit us somewhere?

0:25:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but let's split them a little bit so that when there are no visitors, at least people are.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_05
 No, the rooms have to look like they're sort of occupied.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I think so.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_05
 And then we might lose room or two.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_03
 So, this goes, here goes visitor two.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_03
 This is always the...

0:26:15	SPEAKER_03
 Paola is there, here goes visitor one.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_03
 And is this better?

0:26:21	SPEAKER_03
 Except that we cannot read it, but apart from this.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_04
 It's a little bit crowded in the...

0:26:32	SPEAKER_04
 Because you have...

0:26:33	SPEAKER_04
 Well, not yet, of course, because Paola has not arrived, but starting from January, you will have two full-time persons.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, okay.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_03
 Let me call this visitor one, which implies that it will be the first one occupied by a visitor when they come.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_03
 And this visitor two, which means it's like, well, you know, second chance.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_04
 That why couldn't we basically move you, David, in this two people room with Maria?

0:27:10	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, we could.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_04
 What would this change?

0:27:13	SPEAKER_04
 This is one half-time person.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_04
 And you have Paola Iarina, one visitor position, and I still keep hope that Maria Nikos, the lounge, will on the long-term disappear, because anyhow, I don't believe they can be a lounge where in a place where there are already two people working.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_04
 So the lounge will just die after some point.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_05
 No, but look, it's quite a long room.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_05
 It has two doors.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, yeah.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_05
 It has two doors.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_04
 Very good.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe in the long run, we'll get the wall.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, okay.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_03
 That's true.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_03
 Then there will be a wall, although there are three windows.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_03
 So why would we move David to Maria?

0:27:57	SPEAKER_03
 Do you have any preferences, David?

0:27:59	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, she wants mixing men and women.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_03
 Well, he already is.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_01
 And two visitors will be in one room, but that's fine, because maybe there are not two visitors at the same time.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I wouldn't put the two visitors in the same room, because when there is no one, it makes a big hole and when there are two people.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_03
 So it makes too many variations.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_04
 But then you can move, for instance, if you move David to with Maria, then...

0:28:31	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, the occupancy is better that way.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's more stable.

0:28:39	None
 Okay.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_04
 Stay and go.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_03
 Oops.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_03
 Oops.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_03
 What did we say here?

0:28:54	SPEAKER_03
 This one.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe that's the best we can do.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_04
 If you...

0:29:02	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_04
 If we realistically can plan to have a lounge.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I think that was really decided.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_03
 No, because actually if we do a proposal without a lounge and the other group will...

0:29:16	SPEAKER_03
 I got the message.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_03
 Exactly, and that means that all the constraints that we set and all the other things just...

0:29:24	SPEAKER_03
 Well, just basically disappear.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, sure.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_03
 Which means we've worked for nothing.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_03
 What's wrong with this?

0:29:36	SPEAKER_04
 So who has strong opposition to that?

0:29:41	SPEAKER_03
 I don't.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_03
 You have to go, Susan?

0:29:45	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_03
 We're almost done, Susan.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_03
 But we'll just check the items.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, please.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_04
 No problem.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_04
 No, you just have to...

0:29:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_03
 We'll just review the items to see if we look at all the constraints and then you'll be able to say the final yes or no.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_04
 I think we accommodate most of the constraints.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_04
 Because we're sure that Maggie and Bruno... Maggie is happy with having Bruno in her office, and Pierre is happy to have Maria.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think that's okay.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, yeah, we checked.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_04
 And yes and Nancy, no reason to think that they should be...

0:30:21	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think so.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_03
 It's a possible situation.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_04
 Same thing for Maria and Marian F and Nikos.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_04
 Paula, we don't know yet because she didn't arrive yet.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_04
 And well, Yalina...

0:30:35	SPEAKER_04
 Aha, that means that for a short time, Yalina will be just alone in a three-person room.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's a bit...

0:30:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that was the point and I think David there and...

0:30:45	SPEAKER_03
 But okay, maybe we'll just leave it as an option.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_03
 David or visitor one or two.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_04
 But then we could just for the shake of having a defendable solution as long as Paula has not arrived is to switch for the proposal, Paula and David.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_04
 But we really plan that as soon as Paula is here or even earlier...

0:31:12	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so we'll know that the region actually around here is probably a move-up, Paula.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we can switch to Maria or Paula, our date.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_04
 This is dangerous to propose.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, you have a three-person room with one master student in it.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, no, exactly.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_03
 I wouldn't propose that.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_03
 That's why I always try to separate the visitors just to balance a little bit.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_03
 But okay, we'll be open on that.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_04
 As soon as Paula is here, it starts to be better and we will have visitors.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it depends also on if Yalina stays longer or not, which is not yet very clear.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_03
 But that's a point.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, we'll see.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_04
 Anyway, we'll be open.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_04
 When is she supposed to finish?

0:32:00	SPEAKER_03
 I don't really know, I think her master thesis is probably due...

0:32:05	SPEAKER_03
 No, I would say, yeah, maybe June next year at the latest, yeah.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, I don't know.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_04
 When are we supposed to submit the proposal?

0:32:18	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we won't have any extra meeting for the four of us, so yeah, this one has to be the final one.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_03
 So we'll have actually...

0:32:30	SPEAKER_03
 I'll present this to...

0:32:32	SPEAKER_03
 Well, with the other, I'll compare it with the other one and try to make a decision.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, I think it's even a bit later or two days.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_04
 So as soon as we have Susan, we can switch.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_04
 Again.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_03
 Again.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_04
 But as I say, it's just for the shake of the proposition.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_04
 So I'm even ready to internally say that David will actually be in this room.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we can leave it like this and then...

0:33:00	SPEAKER_04
 What if we change it?

0:33:01	SPEAKER_04
 There are names on the doors?

0:33:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, there will be names on the doors.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, so if we...

0:33:06	SPEAKER_04
 Consume that the problem...

0:33:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_04
 Let's say the technical...

0:33:10	SPEAKER_04
 The psychological problem we have is...

0:33:13	SPEAKER_04
 I'm extremely happy with that solution.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_04
 It will be a working solution starting from January when Paula will be here.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_04
 But currently, if we present it as it is, we have a three-person room that is only occupied by a master student.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_05
 No, because there's another person right now, a student that I just hired.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_05
 And she's just working right now for...

0:33:35	SPEAKER_04
 Ah, so you have a special member of December.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_04
 That's a real...

0:33:40	SPEAKER_04
 She's a real visitor.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_04
 She's a real visitor that is just...

0:33:42	SPEAKER_04
 Ah, so there's one investigator that is just...

0:33:43	SPEAKER_04
 To make a contract for her for two months.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_04
 So then we would have people there.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, we'll keep it like this.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, I...

0:33:53	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I'll try to express all these constraints and say in particular that the two rooms over here are actually sort of...

0:34:02	SPEAKER_03
 Well, things could be changed over there, but on some other side.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_04
 You may have also to say that the unit has to have some...

0:34:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, the visitor space.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's extremely important in the research domain that we can have people coming to visit us.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's true.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_04
 The second point I would suggest is that before you go to defend it, you should circulate it over mail to all the...

0:34:29	SPEAKER_04
 All the involved people.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_04
 Well...

0:34:32	SPEAKER_03
 To double check.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_03
 I think this...

0:34:34	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not very sure, but I think this will be done after the meeting...

0:34:37	SPEAKER_03
 I would win before.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, if you spend time defending a thing and then...

0:34:43	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know, I guess it comes to you or a period, it comes to you saying, no, I don't want to be with Marianne.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_03
 As far as I know, I think Agnes is also taking care of a proposal.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_03
 So, okay, yeah, I'll circulate this.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_03
 Because anything, it's just...

0:34:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, look at it.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_04
 Exactly.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_04
 I have a view on the mountain and I'm with the person I like, so I'm happy.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so maybe we'll learn some more constraints.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_05
 What's the timeline on this now?

0:35:09	SPEAKER_05
 So, you have a meeting...

0:35:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, actually, as I told Martin, well, this is the last time we meet, so this is, well, more or less, our proposal.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_03
 And we'll have a meeting, I think, it's in two days or something like that, to discuss and compare with the other proposal.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_03
 And, well, make a final decision, actually, probably a pre-final one, since we'll have to check again with everyone.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_04
 It's not completely... it's an important issue because I need to know when I will have the office decided, the phone number decided, because these are information that I have to provide to the EPFL administration.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_04
 I'm reachable when I'm at... well, they can phone me on the mobile, but I would definitely prefer to have a clean, filled administrative form that I can give back.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_03
 Well, so, actually, I think, I'm not very sure, but the most important thing is, well, finding out when we will move, and this happens in probably, I think, next month or... depends also on how, well, the furnishing and...

0:36:16	SPEAKER_04
 And then, of course, you have these practical issues, how about internet connections?

0:36:20	SPEAKER_04
 Well, network connections, I mean...

0:36:22	SPEAKER_04
 No, how many connections are there, probably?

0:36:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because that's also something we had all check, you know, if you're in a room with three people and one network...

0:36:29	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, no, no, no, no, the building is very... no, actually, I've seen it, the building is very modern, and you can have actually...

0:36:37	SPEAKER_03
 I think I've activated... we'll get them activated, yeah.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_03
 And I think you get at least three per room...

0:36:43	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so...

0:36:44	SPEAKER_05
 No, I'll get the... for the bigger rooms, you get double for every workplace you get two months.

0:36:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, okay, because sometimes you need the last of one.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_03
 Sometimes you need two computers.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_05
 No, because lots of people have a son and they have a PC, so...

0:36:58	SPEAKER_04
 If you go back to the other slide where you have furniture, so this...

0:37:03	SPEAKER_04
 Do we have any word to say, and so that I would like to have a red chair or a blue desk?

0:37:09	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, no, unfortunately, that's decided by the school, so the chairs are blue, the desk is brown, light brown.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_04
 Do we have to order something, or is it done automatically, so it will be in the office when we move in?

0:37:24	SPEAKER_03
 Normally, it's done automatically, except that we'll have to think...

0:37:29	SPEAKER_05
 Well, we have to say how many places that we want to have.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, these are dictated by the names.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_03
 It's probably more difficult for the lounge.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_03
 What we'll have is have a bit less furniture in the lounge and then bring all the old...

0:37:44	SPEAKER_03
 It's not all because we just bought it, but all the furniture from the previous lounge will bring it here.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_04
 How about the boxes? Because at EPFL, you have to say when you will be moving the boxes so that you have people for moving them.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_04
 Or here you're supposed to move them yourself.

0:38:01	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's the faculty that will take care of...

0:38:04	SPEAKER_04
 Do we receive some information about that?

0:38:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think...

0:38:07	SPEAKER_05
 That just gives us a date when...

0:38:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I mean, it's a completely different issue from arranging people. It's just how they're moving will take place.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_03
 And there are all the things to take care of, but it's quite unrelated with these things.

0:38:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we'll get all the information.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_03
 Thinking about internet connections, I think it's quite okay for the printer to be there.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's feasible. We'll check.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_03
 So the violet box here is... are male boxes also.

0:38:37	SPEAKER_04
 By the way, is there any wireless connection antennas for getting...

0:38:42	SPEAKER_04
 Not at the sixth floor, yeah.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_03
 Not in the building for the moment.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_05
 Well, there is downstairs in the building, and pretty soon the whole building will be covered.

0:38:52	SPEAKER_04
 That's important, I mean, typically for the laptops it's...

0:38:55	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but right now in downstairs it's fine. Some people can pick it up on the sixth floor, but pretty soon the whole building will be covered.

0:39:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, well, I think it's a bit of topic already.

0:39:06	SPEAKER_03
 So let's say that it's a proposal. I'll try to express the constraints and your opinions.

0:39:15	SPEAKER_03
 And, well, I think finally everyone can veto something if there is a huge problem.

0:39:21	SPEAKER_03
 But I think with this we don't run into huge problems.

0:39:24	SPEAKER_04
 The four of us will not veto.

0:39:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, obviously.

0:39:28	SPEAKER_03
 So let me save this.

0:39:30	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you for spending all this time.

0:39:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, you're all happy.
