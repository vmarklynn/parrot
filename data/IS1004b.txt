0:00:30	SPEAKER_02
 Okay everybody is ready. Good morning again. So today we're going to have a second meeting.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_02
 Oh Michael. Hi you're late. You have a good reason for that. Yes. Very good.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_02
 Okay let's have a look to the agenda today. So we're going to have a meeting about the functional design.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_02
 So first before starting I'm just going to go quickly through the minutes of previous meeting.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_02
 So basically we were not decided if we should go for universal or specific remote control but I have new inputs for about that topics.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to go into share with you. And basically we decided to go to individual actions for each of you.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_02
 So industrial designer should work. We're supposed to work on the working design. You should be prepared. Something for us.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_02
 The UE guy also worked on that. And for our marketing expert should deliver some specs.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_02
 Alright so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations. But first we'd like quickly to decide to give a name to the project.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_02
 So I just put it quickly or remote. But if you have any other names that we could decide for just to keep something fun for our project we could discuss quickly.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_02
 Any ideas? What are the power stick? Power stick. Yeah. What else?

0:02:45	SPEAKER_03
 What else? Maybe a Spanish name.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_00
 We're supposed to select into the US market because there's a lot of Spanish speakers there. Maybe something that sounds cool in English but sounds funny and Spanish.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_03
 And then A. M-A. D-O. D-O. It doesn't sound cool for me. But maybe for Spanish for I for... What does it mean in Spanish? Control.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_03
 Because it also sounds like the man's tool. Because men like to have control of the remote.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_00
 So let's go for Mando. Yeah. Objection. Great. Maybe we could have the fonts, you know, especially so you have man in one font and then the O is like...

0:03:55	SPEAKER_02
 I think you don't want to cut women out of the potential buyers. They're the most TV watcher so we should be careful.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_02
 Something that should be addressed later. We should go to... Is it the product of the... It will be international. That's the thing we need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on that.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_02
 So we want to start. Maybe as to the... Maybe as to the market here. Okay. So you have your slides somewhere? Yeah. Should be in participant 4.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, one? Yeah.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. That's coming. Okay. Great. Okay. So yeah, I will give a brief outline about what I prepare for this meeting.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_03
 For the functional requirements and especially for the... For the user requirements. I prepare a marketing report and just to find the weaknesses and the improvements we could do to the current remote controls.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_03
 And also I did a study with... For the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last 5-10 years. There is no significant difference between the first new controls.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. Next slide. Okay. Well, most of the people think that remote controls are ugly, directly. So they admit that they should spend more money in a fancier remote control, which is good. It's interesting point.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_03
 Also, the people are worried about the RSI disease, which is if you repeat the same movement, which is not very appropriate device, you will have problems when you will get all.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_03
 So, people are worried about the shape of the remote control. They are also... They get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think it would be a good point to find a solution to any beep, any alarm or something incorporated with the remote control every time it gets lost.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_03
 And also, I found that the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the remote control.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. So, in my opinion, the mando should be very small because the smaller it is, the more like the... the lauglier is to get lost, lauglier or more lauglier.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_03
 People are so complain because they all have the same size of the buttons, which are not very used, like memorizing channels or all these kind of actions which are not very often.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_03
 But they shouldn't have the same importance in the remote control. Also, the design should fit the hand shape.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_03
 So, it may be interesting to think in both prototypes for right and left-handed people.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_00
 The thing is, most mercantiles are used by more than one person. Unless you are targeting single people, you can cut out a lot of your market.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_03
 Anyway, I think it could be interesting to release a small fraction of... this could be a remote control design.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_01
 A universal design, which is good for both the hands.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, still straight for your hand, but not for a particular hand.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, whether it's left-handed or right-handed, but don't you think that the two points are clashing when you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small?

0:09:23	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry?

0:09:24	SPEAKER_01
 The first and the third point they are clashing.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it can still be a bit. It can still extend past the hand.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_01
 So, fitting the hand doesn't mean much.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_00
 Well, this room right here is very thin and long, so instead of having... you might have it bigger or maybe with some finger mould or something.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_01
 So, design should be similar to that traditional ones.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_01
 Little sleek, longer.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_03
 No, I was thinking of something like... something like the shape of the panel.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, something like a grip, maybe. You could even have some buttons on the side or something.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_03
 It shouldn't be symmetrical, not any more.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_03
 That's good.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_02
 And then finally...

0:10:09	SPEAKER_03
 And finally, the incorporation of LCD or a species recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting, but I don't know if the budget could be large enough.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, first I'm just wondering about the LCD stuff.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_03
 Most of the young people to 30 years old were really interested in this kind of technology.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so maybe it's a good time for me to bring you to some new information.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_02
 We had new requirements from the head of thesis of the company.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_02
 And so they wanted to... they would like to be restricted to TV.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if you had this information already.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_02
 So they want... has to restrict the remote control to TV only because of time limitations.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, this marketing report is restricted to TV remote control.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_02
 Excellent.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_02
 So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because... well, well, tilletext is how data now.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_02
 And finally, it should be clear that the corporate image, that means colorless and logos of the car our company, should be clearly identified in the product.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_00
 So we're still working on this 25 euro price point because I think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there, this is quite a low price.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_00
 If we're... maybe I can get to this in my presentation though.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah. So maybe you can jump to your presentations right now.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so let's keep in mind about this last point about LCD and speech.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. I think even if it was within budget to speech record system, it might be a bit difficult because if you think...

0:12:05	SPEAKER_00
 if you're watching TV, you're going to have a lot of this background noise from the TV which might interfere with...

0:12:10	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry, what is your following?

0:12:12	SPEAKER_00
 Put it in three.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_00
 You might have some background noise from the TV which will make the speech recognition much better.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but you should be able to activate or disactivate.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah. Press a button to talk and the TV. 10 and 50 seconds off.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 No, it could be command control kind of thing. It recognizes particular sequence and then it gets activated.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_01
 Means you should say like there's that remote control being on or beyond kind of thing.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_01
 And then remote control comes into the picture for the speech recognition.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_01
 Because this kind of thing means speeches there from the TV also. So there should be something command control.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_01
 You start and then you stop.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_01
 It's like VIA editor you are having two modes, similarly. Otherwise it's just like idle.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, okay.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so could I describe the mouse maybe a bit easier to...

0:13:04	None
 Sorry.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_00
 Could I use the mouse or...

0:13:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. Thanks.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_02
 The wheel doesn't work.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_00
 Great.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so well researching this topic.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_00
 First of all, just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote and just look to see if they're actually available in any current remote.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_00
 And then also search for which of the top rated remote controls on opinions.com which is a, you know, a customer written basically review site.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_00
 So there's a pretty wide range of remote controls this day.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_00
 And this remote control on the right here is one of the more extravagant, but it's not really...

0:13:54	SPEAKER_00
 It's by no means on its own in being so expensive.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_00
 There are a lot of expensive remote control about that.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_00
 It looks like a PDE.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it does.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_00
 Well, basically all the functions are controlled through the LCD screen except for the really, really kind of main functions which have a couple of their own buttons.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_00
 And if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out on the market, I know we're working on television remotes, but a lot of the universal remotes out there have LCD screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple devices, I suppose, you can have multiple kind of functions, different functions on the screen at different times.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_00
 But the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control, and it's kind of difficult to see in this light, but it has a scroll wheel on it, which is kind of like a mouse scroll wheel, which I think is really kind of important design aspect.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_00
 Because the thing is, what we, this presentation about is what we want the remote control to actually do. And obviously the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just changes the channel.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_00
 Now, I think that a scroll wheel is actually a pretty handy way of changing the channel because I know when I use the remote to change the channel, I very rarely use the numbers on the pad.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_00
 I rarely use the up and down because most channels are, you know, two digit numbers and you have to press, you know, a special button to enter a two digit number and then the number so it's just, it's annoying.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_00
 So I think a scroll wheel is quite handy. Now, the scroll wheel is much more useful if you have an LCD screen and it springs us to the point you were mentioning before about the internet capability.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_00
 One possibility, if we, now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for 25 euro, but one possibility is to download program information into the LCD screen.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_00
 So then instead of actually saying, I want to, I want to go to channel 37 because I know this program's on, you know, often you don't know what channel it's on or you don't know what's on.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_00
 If you have a list of programs on your LCD screen, you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_00
 So if you think about it's kind of like, you know, mobile phones now you don't use, you don't remember people's phone number, you remember the name and you go find that name and ring it.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_00
 So this would be pretty kind of anything to have, but we really need to discuss the price.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_00
 So I mean there are, there are a, this is another multi-purpose remote control where it's, it's, it's very simple. There's only a few buttons, but what each of those buttons does, something different in a different context.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_00
 So this is something else we might want to get to is really kind of limiting the number of buttons because this is the top rating universal remote control on, on the opinions.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_00
 It's really maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as possible because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control and give them all the same before about having different size buttons for different, you know, frequently used tasks.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_00
 I think also, you know, the location and shape of the buttons is important, but also the number of buttons. So if you have too many buttons it increases the difficulty of finding.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_01
 But what is one problem means then the user has to understand each of that functionality.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well, because the same button is doing to anything.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we will have a bit of a simpler task in that we're only doing a television remote control. I think maybe one option is to have, you know, a little flip open door that, that you have hidden most of the time, but contains the extra buttons like say the number buttons, for instance.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_00
 I would, if I had my perfect remote control, I would probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way they don't really do anything. Maybe, you know, although I do also find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or whatever.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_00
 But maybe a door that you can permanently remove or permanently have on would be good.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_00
 But I think definitely you need to keep the buttons down to a minimum, but not not like that kind of interfere with the functionality of the device.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_03
 I think I think that the transition to this to this new remote control should then be very very abrupt, very hard because if people see a remote, see a remote control without numbers, they will think it's very difficult to learn, very difficult to.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_03
 Very different to.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_00
 Traditions on how you market it. If you have the right advertisements showing how easy it is and how you can, you know, navigate to a program without the numbers and people might say, that looks pretty easy.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. Can you continue? Please, mate.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. So I think one of the really kind of useful things you can do with internet connectivity would be to have this a program driven interface rather than the channel number.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_00
 So if we can have a high priced remote control, I think that would really be worth something that would be worth implementing.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_00
 There's the LCD screen, which maybe is too expensive.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_00
 But I think also the scroll wheel I haven't mentioned in here, the scroll wheel could be used without an LCD screen just for changing channel numbers easily.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think even that, I mean, that would be a fairly cheap thing compared to an LCD screen to implement.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_00
 I'm both in it would be quite useful as well.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_00
 And the other thing, you said we need to keep it just television, but I think one, maybe one option, since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device, is, you know, there's a certain kind of cool or well factor that you can kind of, you know, you can have with technology and maybe we want to make it something that's extensible to do other tasks. Say you have like, another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can say, change the lighting in the room.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_00
 You know, that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_00
 You can, you know, you're also selling the potential of the device and you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like, change the lights, I'm not close the windows, whatever turn the heating on.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_00
 And I think that's something we may need to have as as at least as an optional extra to kind of make our product cool since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. Okay, thanks.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, man, you want to go. Yeah. Give me.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_01
 So most of the things that you are discussing about a speech recognition, I mean, this is my own. Yeah, it should be great.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_02
 Nope, but that one.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_01
 You are too. Okay, so the working design is user interface could be of two times.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_01
 One is the usual press buttons, which are there so that the user feels that he's knowing doing some he's knowing about the technology.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_01
 So he's pretty comfortable if he wants to get this and on top of that there, there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_01
 So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes, it can.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_01
 It can be useful for them and the new users as our marketing expert was saying they can use the new guest mode, which is speech recognition kind of thing.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, sorry to interrupt you, but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use will.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_01
 That's right. So anyway, that didn't come into my mind.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_01
 So that is a possibility. These could be other kind of interfaces means we can have depending on the cost, how much we can afford.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_01
 We can have different kind of interfaces. So speed buttons are something which is very everybody's familiar with.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_01
 So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there, the people know what it is.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_01
 And on top of that, if we are having extra functionality, they are willing to shell the 25 euros money, which we are thinking.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_01
 Otherwise, we are just like others in the market. So anyway, that is the first user interface could be of more than one type.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_01
 And yeah, that means we can do the online changes, which cannot be done now actually.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_01
 So apart from a speech, we can have this crawl kind of thing with the buttons.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_01
 Now for buttons, normal requirements like bitcoding and all those things are required.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_01
 And for voice, limited vocabulary, automatic speech recognition system is required.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_01
 And we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that increases the cost also.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_01
 That's right. But we have to see how much, what kind of microphones and stuff like that.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_02
 Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to target?

0:23:13	SPEAKER_02
 Well, of such technologies is enough.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, if it is limited vocabulary, usually it is enough.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. We can target, means we can target 95% accuracy or somewhere 90%.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_02
 I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambient microphone.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_02
 Because you are not going to speak into any of these different modes.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_01
 No, it could be a little bit.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_02
 So it could be a few centimeters.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_00
 But one other thing that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is when you want to sell into other markets.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_00
 So because I'm not sure exactly where we're going to sell this but I presume it's not just going to be English-speaking countries.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_00
 So then you have to train models for.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_01
 It's more like, means there are different speech technologies which are existing.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_01
 So a DTW could be kind of, which is the easiest.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_01
 So you have to store some templates on the chip itself.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_01
 And it's just dynamic time-wapping where you try to find out what it is.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_01
 So you start having a model which is to be trained and being a microcontroller.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, we should discuss that later after this slide.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_02
 This is a very important issue.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_02
 Discussion.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, next.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_02
 It's finished.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_02
 No, no.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_01
 Components.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_01
 Components.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll go to the next slide.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, sure.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so this is the design which we are thinking.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_01
 So we are having the power button and the switch which is not much and then we are having the bulb with us which is to indicate whether the power is on or not.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_01
 And then there are two kind of things which can be.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_01
 So one is the button interface which has not been shown because of lack of time.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_01
 So we could not put that.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_01
 So now where the ASR decoder is sitting.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_01
 Similarly, there are different kind of interfaces which could be there.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_01
 So there is ASR decoder which could be there and then there could be another scroll button, scroll, scroller and then there could be buttons.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_01
 And all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the map.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_01
 Put it in the proper message format and then there is the chip which is sitting.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_01
 The green one and it converts it into bitcodes and that bitcodes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_01
 So this is the easiest design that they could be.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_01
 So in ASR decoder we can have things in parallel to have different technologies.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_01
 So this was the, my personal preference was that we can have ASR sitting there on the remote control.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I guess you could actually train the remote control as you are using it by saying you know, turn volume up and you press the first button like people teach sound language the kids well.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but as soon as you try to put a microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_01
 So these are the slight problems.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_01
 So your opinion is that we should go for because the reason is that if we go into the market means though I don't have much idea,

0:26:14	SPEAKER_03
 but as he the marketing expert presentation was if you can sell a specific condition remote control for 25 euros every one will buy it.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_00
 So if you go to just because I'm the, you know, well if I was using remote control to say turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well. I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm instead of pressing up on the remote control.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_00
 You know if there's some, there's some dialogue all of a sudden that I can't hear.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_00
 I'm trying to actually find out what's being said.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe speak track dish and get in the way more than I tell.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. So yeah, but you know the average frequency of passion bottoms.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_03
 It's about, well, depends if it's a remote control.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_03
 It's about 80, 80, 80 passes per hour or something like that.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe if the remote control is something that you don't actually have to pick up anymore that would be a useful feature of the speech recognition.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_00
 If you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it then.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, gentlemen, we have to take some decisions right now.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_02
 So if I kind of summarize everything we say.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_02
 We're targeting TV.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_02
 We need to have remote control which is fancy, which is easy to handle to spoil not too big.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_02
 We have a good shape for that.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_02
 A good shape. Yes.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_02
 We should bring new technologies for young people.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_02
 And as we have also requirements to use to push through to all the internet.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe this is something we can stick to it.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_02
 And also very interesting things I have seen on one of our competitors.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_02
 Is this wheel that we can use to navigate.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_02
 So my feeling is that regarding costs, budgets we have and target price.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_02
 It's not possible to go to LCD.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_02
 And also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_02
 First, why not to go to LCD?

0:28:29	SPEAKER_02
 Because in fact, as we are targeting a TV, in fact we can use TV screen as a screen to feedback, to give some feedback information about what we could have.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it depends if we don't, unless we have some input, some video input to the TV, or we have control over the TV, then we can't actually display that.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_00
 If we produce the TV is then, then, you know, we can put menus up there.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_00
 But otherwise we need to actually have some kind of something sitting in between the video signal and the TV to superimpose those menus.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_00
 So that's an extra.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's right. Don't contact with people in TV or systems that exist.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_00
 Well, this is another question.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_00
 We still haven't really defined the remote.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_00
 You said we're focusing on TV, but is it still kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control?

0:29:24	SPEAKER_00
 Or is there something for our own line of televisions?

0:29:28	SPEAKER_00
 Because that really makes a big difference.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_00
 Even if we have contacts, we can't really produce remote control that can bring up menus on other companies TVs.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_00
 It's just there are too many TVs out there.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's a good point.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_02
 What could be the cost of...

0:29:46	SPEAKER_02
 Well, could we feed the targets in terms of cost if we go to LCD and remote control?

0:29:56	SPEAKER_00
 For 25 euros?

0:29:58	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's impossible.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_00
 But I think it will be good to know if there is any leverage in a leeway in that 25 euros.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_00
 Because for 25 euros I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_00
 And that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company, which is putting the fashion into electronics.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_00
 So I'd like to know if there's any chance of increasing the unit price.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_02
 So you mean we should target something maybe which is which would be more expensive, but really fancy in terms to have really netted value?

0:30:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because...

0:30:41	SPEAKER_02
 So regarding the automatic speech recognition, I think this is...

0:30:45	SPEAKER_03
 What would be the goal of putting an LCD in a remote control?

0:30:50	SPEAKER_03
 What kind of information?

0:30:53	SPEAKER_00
 Because you can have things like the program name instead of the channel numbers.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_03
 But most of the TVs, no where they show the...

0:31:00	SPEAKER_03
 They actually tell it text.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_02
 Well, because they have to let this on it.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_02
 You have a teletext signal that you can...

0:31:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, most of the TVs have teletext, no where they...

0:31:15	SPEAKER_02
 They have to... most of them have teletext, but we want to get to it well.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_02
 One of our requirements is to move to teletext through the user of the internet.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_02
 So to...

0:31:28	SPEAKER_00
 You get a lot more information.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_02
 It draws more easily the teletext, for instance, through your remote control.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_03
 So what would appear in the LCD?

0:31:41	SPEAKER_00
 So you could have the name of the program, you could have...

0:31:45	SPEAKER_00
 Start time, you know where it's up to.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_00
 All the programs you could have...

0:31:49	SPEAKER_00
 You could have even a little image of, you know, the main actors or something.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_00
 So you can quickly just kind of...

0:31:56	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if this information is available from teletext also.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_00
 Well, no, but there are other electronic program guides.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_00
 They may not have pictures, but maybe they do.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_02
 It also depends on the country.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_02
 The same reason that we cannot overlay information on the TV.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_02
 We couldn't grab information with Giznads there.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_00
 No, but I mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from, so it may be possible that there are people out there providing that.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_02
 So that means we need an extra internet connection to use the remote control, if you want to browse.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_02
 In addition to the TV.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_02
 Or it should be a special TV connection.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I think if we're gonna... I think we would definitely need the internet connection.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_00
 Because even with... I don't think you could even get teletext information from the TV on to the remote control.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_00
 Especially if we don't control the TV. I don't know, we need to find that out.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, we need to close the meeting.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_02
 So just a small thing.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_01
 What kind of market we are targeting?

0:32:54	SPEAKER_01
 Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market?

0:32:57	SPEAKER_01
 Or what?

0:32:58	SPEAKER_01
 So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost of LCD thing could be as high as the TV itself.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_01
 That is very important.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_00
 No, no.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_00
 If it's a really small TV, you know.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_02
 People go through buying another remote control when they broke.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_02
 They broke the whole and they want to go for universal one.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_02
 And they take the fanciest they can have.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_02
 So this is... that we should target.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_02
 So the... the... the... the commitment is following.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_02
 We don't go for speech recognition technology.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_02
 The LCD is still on this... is still open to discussion.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_02
 Is this up to you to go through this... this way and to report...

0:33:43	SPEAKER_02
 report me back next meeting?

0:33:46	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:33:47	SPEAKER_03
 I think that the Space Organization technology...

0:33:49	SPEAKER_03
 It's a bit cheaper. It's cheaper than the LCD.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but not sure.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it's cheaper, but we have no...

0:33:56	SPEAKER_03
 Because with the LCD you need more requirements.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_03
 You need internet connection.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_03
 You need more things, but...

0:34:03	SPEAKER_03
 For the Space Organization you don't need anything.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_00
 You have to say...

0:34:07	SPEAKER_03
 Channel 50.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_00
 And that's it.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_00
 I think the top of people that are going to want to buy a very stylish remote control...

0:34:13	SPEAKER_00
 with lots of new technologies.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_00
 The kind of people that are going to have, you know, a wireless internet connection maybe or...

0:34:18	SPEAKER_03
 But then we should move to another target.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_03
 Because I have $25.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_00
 I need to find out... Can we increase the price point of this remote control?

0:34:27	SPEAKER_00
 Because otherwise we need...

0:34:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, this is an open question for you.

0:34:31	None
 Yeah.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_02
 This is up to you to tell us.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_02
 But I'm definitely not keen on...

0:34:37	SPEAKER_02
 To move to another target?

0:34:39	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_02
 I'm definitely not keen on going to speed-roaching technologies.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not keen enough.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure that we have a product... really that work.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_02
 It's kind of hard to guarantee that you're going to...

0:34:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_02
 How to guarantee such preferences is very hard.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_03
 The expert said 95%.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_00
 95% is not good enough.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_02
 It's very bad.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_02
 So, this is the end of this discussion.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_02
 Next meeting...

0:35:11	SPEAKER_02
 You're on the task you have to work on.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_02
 So, you have to work on the component concepts.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_02
 You have to work on user interface.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_02
 And you have to go through a trend-watching.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_02
 So, the question is still open about the LCD thing.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_02
 I hope that next meeting we will...

0:35:37	SPEAKER_02
 We take some decisions that are there.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_02
 Thanks.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, bye.

0:36:11	None
 Okay.
