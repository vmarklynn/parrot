0:00:53	None

0:00:54	None
 Ja, ik wist niet op een filmmeltjes.

0:00:56	None
 Ja, oké.

0:01:02	None

0:01:03	None
 Goed moeiting.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, goedmorgen, alles goedmogen.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_00
 Goed moeiting.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_00
 Ik wil je de eerste meeting welkom te willen.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_00
 Ik heb een beetje een presentatie.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_00
 Mijn neem is Marijn Plomf.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_00
 En ik hoop dat je het een paar minuten in hetzelfde is.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_00
 Ik ben de projectmanager van deze project.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_00
 En, well, ik wil je vertellen wat het is.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_00
 Dit is de agenda voor de eerste meeting.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_00
 Dit is de opening.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_00
 Dan we hopen, we hopen, we get acquainted to each other.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_00
 We'll do a little tooltraining with these two things.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_00
 We'll take a look at the project plan.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_00
 There will be time for discussion.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, we have to discuss, because we have to create a product.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_00
 And then we will close this session.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_00
 Maar, first of all, we'd like to introduce you to this room.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_00
 As you probably have noticed, there are a little black fields on the table.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_00
 You have to put your laptop exactly in that field.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_00
 So the little cameras can see your face.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_00
 There are cameras everywhere around the room, especially here, for your face coordinates.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_00
 And this isn't a pie.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_00
 It's a set of microphones.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_00
 And there are microphones here also.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_00
 Please don't be afraid of them.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_00
 They won't hurt you.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_00
 Well, as said, I'm the project manager, and I'm hoping for a good project.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_00
 And I'd like to hear who you are and what your functions are on this project.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_00
 Let's start with the ladies.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_01
 I'm Imkudio.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_01
 And my function is user interface design, I think.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_01
 So that's me.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, I'm Vaseline Nemare.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_03
 I'm the industrial designer.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_03
 And I hope to look forward to a very pleasing end of this project.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so my name is Danny Mangrel.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_02
 I'm a marketing expert.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_02
 My job is in the company to promote the company, to promote products to the customers.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_02
 So I also hope we have a pleasant working with each other.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well, we have some expertise from different pieces of the company.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_00
 That's good.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_00
 Well, as said, we're working on a project.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_00
 And the aim for the project is to create a new remote control, which has to be original, trendy, and of course, user-friendly.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_00
 And I hope we have the expertise to create such a project.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_00
 The way we hope to achieve that is through the following methods.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_00
 It consists of three phases, namely the functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_00
 As you can see, all of these phases consist of two parts, namely individual work parts and a meeting where we will discuss our work so far.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but first, I will tell you something about the tools we have here.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_00
 I already talked about the cameras and microphones, but they are not of much use to us.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_00
 We will have to take advantage of these two things.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_00
 They are smart boards.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_00
 As you can see, you can give a presentation on them.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_00
 And this one here is a white board.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_00
 And I will instruct you about that soon.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_00
 As you also noticed, this presentation document is in our project folder and every document you put in this folder is possible to show that here in our meeting room.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_00
 And there are available on both smart boards, but I think we will mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_00
 As you can see, this is the same toolbar as it's located here.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_00
 The most functions we will use will be to add a new page.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_00
 To go back and forward between pages and of course to save it every now and then.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_00
 And this is the pen with which you can draw on the board.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_00
 For instance, like this, everything is okay, but first I put it on the pen.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_00
 You see, I'm new to it too.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_00
 And then you can write things like test or whatever you want.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_00
 As you can see, you have to move it a little bit slow.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_00
 It's not such a fast board.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_00
 It's a smart board, but also a slow board.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_00
 But you can write things and of course you can also, when you click here, erase things.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_00
 So we have a test left.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_00
 And you can also delete an entire page, but we ask you not to do that.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_00
 Just simply create a new one and start all over because we want to save all the results.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_00
 Does everyone understand this?

0:06:07	SPEAKER_00
 So you can't erase anything.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_00
 Well, you can erase it with the eraser, but you shouldn't delete an entire page.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_00
 Just create a new blank one.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_00
 I will delete this one out because we don't use it yet.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_00
 But you can of course erase when you make a mistake, but don't delete entire pages.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_00
 And you can also, let's see, I think it's here, change the color of your pen.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_00
 For instance, take a blue one and change the line with five.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_00
 And that's what you will need for our first exercise because I'm going to ask you to draw your favorite animal.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_00
 It's also to get to know each other because I'm asking three things for that drawing.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_00
 To do it on a blank sheet with different colors.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_00
 And I just showed you how to pick a color and also with different pen widths, which I also showed you.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_00
 And favorite characteristic can be just one word.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I'm not very good at drawing, but I will go first and try to draw.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_00
 Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_01
 It's a sheep.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_03
 That's a seal.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_03
 Beaver.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it could be everything.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe when I put on this thing, it could be a turtle snail or a snail.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_00
 Or the snail doesn't have legs.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_00
 Or the turtle has. And those are slow.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_00
 And I hope our project group will not be slow, but we will work to a good result and do it as fast as we can.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_00
 Time for another animal. Would you like to go next?

0:08:15	SPEAKER_02
 No problem.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_02
 That was forward.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_01
 That's good.

0:08:42	None
 That help.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_03
 To make it a little bit easier.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_02
 It should gear up.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_02
 Like that cute.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_03
 Or dinosaur.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's easy to recognize.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the favorite character is that the long neck can reach everything.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_02
 And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_02
 So that's my favorite animal.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_00
 Anything else you need to write?

0:09:47	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, another more.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_03
 Toll.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_01
 Toll.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_01
 Good.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_01
 So I can draw with this.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_02
 Wow.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_03
 That's a must.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_03
 Bunny-rather.

0:10:28	None
 Okay.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_01
 One more.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_01
 You can guess what it is.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_01
 I hope.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_01
 It's a rabbit.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_01
 And well, it's a quick, I guess.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_01
 That's my favorite animal.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_00
 And a final drawing.

0:11:29	None
 Okay.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_03
 I draw a drawing.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_03
 A dolphin because of this intelligence.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_03
 One of the most intelligent animals in our world.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_03
 Dally-hub.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_03
 Dally-hub.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_03
 I'm sorry.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_03
 Eerator.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 You can try it.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_01
 The eraser now.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_03
 Then.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_03
 Perfect.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_00
 Well, thank you very much.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_00
 I can see we have some drawing talents.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_00
 What did you draw?

0:12:45	SPEAKER_00
 A drawing.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_00
 Well, nice animals, nice words.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_00
 Sounds good.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_00
 Back to business, back to the money part.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_00
 From the finance department, I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of 25 euros.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_00
 And we're hoping for a aim of 50 million euros.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 And we're hoping to achieve that by aiming for an international market.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it's time for some discussion.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_00
 I've wrote down some examples here of what we can speak about.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_00
 What's your experience with remote controls?

0:13:24	SPEAKER_00
 What kind of ideas do you have to design and you remote control, maybe, for which market segments should be aimed?

0:13:30	SPEAKER_00
 Or should we aim for all segments?

0:13:32	SPEAKER_00
 Well, actually, I'd like to hand the word back to you.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_00
 What's your experience with remote control?

0:13:40	SPEAKER_03
 A lot of buttons.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_03
 A lot of buttons, which you don't use.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_03
 Complex.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_03
 Not user friendly.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_01
 You need to search for the buttons which you want to reach in the...

0:13:57	SPEAKER_02
 Boring.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_00
 Boring.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_00
 Not fun to use in remote.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_00
 Black or black.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_03
 So, black colors.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, maybe we should try to make it fun.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_03
 We use batteries and last batteries and poor signal.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_01
 But we have a lot of remote controls.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_01
 Different remote control.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_01
 Different remote control.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_01
 Different devices.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_01
 But we can integrate them or something.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_03
 For the use of different devices.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 Your stereo and your TV, you know.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, but then again, you still have a lot of buttons.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, but it's a possibility to put those buttons behind some kind of perfection.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_03
 So, if you only get the freedom when you need them.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_02
 It's possible.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_02
 So, did you get the...

0:14:53	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no, no.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_01
 Did you just give it to me?

0:14:56	SPEAKER_03
 For example, you get the same size remote control you use every day.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_03
 The usual buttons such as a zapping, let's go to the Dutch.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_03
 And the following control are only the possible buttons to use directly.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_03
 Or the numbers.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_03
 The numbers, of course.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_03
 But not the buttons used to search on the channels on your television.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_03
 Young used those first time or play balls.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_00
 So, maybe a minimalist design.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think so.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_00
 It was one of buttons.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_01
 So, you should make sure that you have every button they need on it.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_01
 That's a...

0:15:37	SPEAKER_01
 Things for a daily text.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know that.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_03
 A daily text?

0:15:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, that's it.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_00
 So, you don't want to bother people with loads of buttons.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_00
 But on the other hand, they need many buttons so they don't have to get out of their seat.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_02
 Because I think markets will be all kind of people, all the elderly, young people.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_01
 If it's international, you should look in...

0:16:03	SPEAKER_01
...think in Britain, they have different things they can do with TV.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_01
 Or so that you can choose what you want to see.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if you should take that in consideration.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_01
 It's just for the normal TV.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think that's better because...

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 I think if you're going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only Britain, then...

0:16:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, because we'll rise higher than 1250, I think.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know if the TV is better to use the whole world and Britain.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_03
 No, I think the main idea of this remote control is...

0:16:42	SPEAKER_03
...to make it user friendly.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_03
 So I think when the customers will buy this remote control, they already have a remote control which companies...

0:16:55	SPEAKER_03
...with the standard remote control which comes with a television.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_03
 So it only has to have the most used buttons.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_03
 You don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_01
 Then you have to find your other remote control buttons to search.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_03
 But it's impossible to accommodate all the buttons on the different televisions sets on one remote control.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's impossible.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_03
 For example, Sony Television has the opportunity to make it possible for one side of the screen teletext on the other side.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_03
 Just regular television.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_02
 I think the most television nowadays do this.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_03
 They don't use the same signal on remote control because you can't use a Panasonic remote control on a Phillips television.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_02
 Then you have to choose the...

0:17:52	SPEAKER_02
...always with a universal remote.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_02
 You have to choose a code.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_02
 Which type of television you have.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_02
 There's no problem.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_02
 I think the two pages on the same screen, like teletext and normal television, that's nowadays standard.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_03
 I think the most people will buy the remote control because they lost the first one.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_03
 The first one is broken.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_03
 Perhaps they have a better television.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_03
 So that option is not...

0:18:28	SPEAKER_03
...optional for those people.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_01
 If you look into the future, then they want to...

0:18:36	SPEAKER_03
...experience the phone.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_03
 So we should take that in consideration.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well, any more ideas?

0:18:45	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_00
 Think I'll come up.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, yeah, well, we have some time.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see, what more I have to tell you.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think there's much left.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_00
 We're starting to close.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_00
 Our next meeting will start with a little bit early, but our next meeting will start in 30 minutes.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_00
 In the meantime, there's time for some individual actions.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_00
 As you can see, the different roles have different tasks.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_00
 And there's a ping.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_00
 Is it my laptop?

0:19:22	SPEAKER_03
 Stop the meeting.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_00
 We'll close it in five minutes and the meeting.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_00
 The marketing expert will take a look at the user requirements specification.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_00
 The user interface designer will work out the technical functions design.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_00
 And this was the interface designer or the interaction designer.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_00
 No, the interaction designer.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, first this was right.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_03
 We'll take a look at the working design.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_00
 Is it built the interaction?

0:19:54	SPEAKER_00
 Industrial design.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, let's just use the acronyms.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_00
 And of course, specific instructions will be sent to you for your personal coach.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_01
 So I should look at what you should be able to do with your mouse or how?

0:20:09	SPEAKER_00
 Well, those instructions will be in the email you will receive shortly.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_01
 I hope.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_00
 And of course, you have your own expertise.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_00
 That was what I had to say.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_00
 Are there any more questions?

0:20:22	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_00
 No? Okay, well, I think then we have had back to our offices.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_00
 And start working.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_02
 I have one question.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_02
 One question.
