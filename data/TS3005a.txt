0:00:00	None
 On the road turn on We're getting by now I can unexplainable This place seems to be different If we Laf Quadretta happened Good morning

0:00:17	SPEAKER_03
 Good morning.

0:00:47	None
 Thank you, I have you a chip over there man. Cotto?

0:00:52	SPEAKER_02
 I have some sushi.

0:00:54	None
 Yeah, its 1977.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_00
 Sh Good morning. I'd like to welcome you to our first meeting. I've prepared a little presentation.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_00
 My name is Marim Plonf and I hope you will introduce yourself in a few minutes as well.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_00
 I'm the project manager of this project and well I will tell you fur on what actually is the project.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_00
 This is the agenda for our first meeting. This is the opening. Then we will get, I will hope we will get acquainted with each other.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_00
 We'll do a little tool training with these two things. We'll take a look at the project plan.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_00
 There will be time for discussion. Actually we have to discuss because we have to create a product and then we will close this session.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_00
 First of all, I'd like to introduce you to this room. As you probably have noticed there are little black fields on the table.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_00
 You have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_00
 There are cameras everywhere around the room especially here for your face.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_00
 This isn't a pie. It's a set of microphones and there are microphones here also. Please don't be afraid of them. They won't hurt you.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_00
 I'm the project manager and I'm hoping for a good project. I'd like to hear who you are and what your functions are on this project.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_03
 Let's start with the ladies. I'm Imkriel and my function is user interface design. I'm a industrial designer and I hope to look forward to a very pleasing end of this project.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_02
 My name is Danny Magrale. I'm a marketing expert. My job is in the company to promote products to the customers.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_02
 I also hope we have a pleasant work with each other.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_00
 We have some expertise from different pieces of the company. That's good.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_00
 As said, we're working on a project and the aim for that project is to create a new remote control which has to be original, trendy and user friendly.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_00
 I hope we have the expertise to create such a project.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_00
 The way we hope to achieve that is through the following methods. It consists of three phases, namely the functional design, conceptual design and detailed design.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_00
 As you can see, all of these phases consist of two parts, namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss our work so far.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_00
 But first, I will tell you something about the tools we have here. I already talked about the cameras and microphones, but they are not much use to us.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_00
 We will have to take advantage of these two things. They are smart boards. As you can see, you can give a presentation on them.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_00
 This one here is a white board. I will instruct you about that soon.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_00
 As you also noticed, this presentation document is in our project folder. Every document you put in this folder is possible to show that here in our meeting room.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_00
 There are available on both smart boards, but I think we will use this one for the document in the shared folder.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_00
 As you can see, this is the same toolbar as is located here. The most functions we will use will be to add a new page to go back and forward between pages and, of course, to save it every now and then.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_00
 This is the pen with which you can draw on the board. For instance, like this, everything is OK, but I have to put it on the pen.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_00
 You can write things like test or whatever you want. As you can see, you have to move it a little bit slow. It is not such a fast board. It is a smart board, but also a slow board.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_00
 You can write things, and, of course, you can also, when you click here, erase things, so we have asked left.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_00
 You can also delete an entire page, but we ask you not to do that. Just simply create a new one and start all over because we want to save all the results.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_00
 Does everyone understand this?

0:06:07	SPEAKER_00
 You can erase anything. You can erase it with the eraser, but you shouldn't delete an entire page.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_00
 You can delete a blank one, and I will delete this one now because we don't use it yet.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_00
 You can, of course, erase when you make a mistake, but don't delete entire pages.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_00
 Also, let's see, I think it's here, change the color of your pen. For instance, take a blue one and change the line with 5.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_00
 And that's what you will need for our first exercise because I'm going to ask you to draw your favorite animal.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_00
 It's also to guess to know each other because I'm asking three things for that drawing. To do it on a blank sheet with different colors, and I just showed you how to pick a color, and also with different pen widths, which I also showed you.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_00
 And favorite characteristic can be just one word.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I'm not very good at drawing, but I will go first and try to draw.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_00
 Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_01
 It's a sheep.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_03
 It's a silver.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_03
 A silver.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_03
 A beaver.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it's weird.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_00
 It could be everything.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe when I put on this thing, it could be a turtle snail.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_00
 Or a snail.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_00
 But the snail doesn't have legs.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_01
 The turtle has.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_00
 And those are slow.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_00
 And I hope our project group will not be slow, but we will work to a good result and do it as fast as we can.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_00
 Time for another animal. Would you like to go next?

0:08:15	SPEAKER_02
 It was forward.

0:08:23	None
 That is so good.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_03
 That helps.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_02
 To make it a little bit easier.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_01
 It's not that cute.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_01
 Or a dinosaur.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's easy to recognize.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_02
 The favorite characteristic is the long neck.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_02
 It can reach everything.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_02
 I can also reach a lot with this project.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_00
 That's my favorite animal.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_00
 Anything else you need to know?

0:09:52	SPEAKER_01
 I can draw with this.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_03
 Wow.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_03
 It's a mouse.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_01
 You can guess what it is, I hope.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_01
 It's a rabbit.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it's a quick, I guess.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_01
 That's my favorite animal.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_03
 I've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence, one of the most intelligent animals in our world.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_03
 I can see we have some drawing sounds.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 Well, nice animals, nice words.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_00
 Sounds good.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_00
 Back to business, back to the money part.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_00
 From the finance department, I've learned that we are aiming for a selling price of 25 euros and we're hoping for a aim of 50 million euros and we're hoping to achieve that by aiming for an international market.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 And the production costs will be 12 euro 50 max.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well, it's time for some discussion.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_00
 I've wrote down some examples here of what we can speak about, what's your experience with remote controls, what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control, maybe, for which market segments should be aimed or should be aimed for all segments.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_00
 Well, actually, I'd like to hand the word back to you.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_00
 What's your experience with remote control?

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 A lot of buttons.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_03
 Which you don't use.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_03
 Complex.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_03
 Complex.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_03
 Not user friendly.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_01
 You search for the buttons, which ones which.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_02
 Boring.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_02
 Boring.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_00
 It's not fun to use in remote.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_00
 Black or black.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_03
 So, black colors.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_00
 Or maybe we should try to make it fun.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_03
 We use batteries and last batteries and poor signal.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_03
 The angle is to use.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_01
 Different remote control.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_01
 Different remote control.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_01
 Different remote control.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_01
 We can integrate them or something.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_03
 For the use of different devices.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 Your stereo and your TV and the...

0:14:30	SPEAKER_01
 That's nice.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but then again, you still have a lot of buttons.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's right.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I think there's a possibility to put those buttons behind some kind of protection.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_03
 So, if you only get serum when you need them.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_02
 It's possible.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_02
 So, do you only get...

0:14:53	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no, no.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_01
 You just keep it tomorrow.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_03
 For example, you get the same size remote control you use every day.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_03
 And the usual buttons such as zapping, which is called a Dutch.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_03
 And the following is the only possible buttons to use directly.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_02
 Or the numbers.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_03
 And the numbers, of course.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_03
 But not the buttons used to search on the channels on your television.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_03
 You're going to use those the first time.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_03
 Play-balls.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_00
 So, maybe a minimalist design.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think so.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_01
 Of buttons.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_01
 But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_01
 That's a...

0:15:37	SPEAKER_01
 Thanks for a...

0:15:38	SPEAKER_01
 Tailor text.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know that.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_01
 That's a name.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_03
 Tailor text.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_03
 Thanks.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_00
 So, you don't want to bother people with loads of buttons, but on the other hand, they need many buttons, so they don't have to get out of their seat.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_02
 I think the market will be all kinds of people.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_02
 All of the young people.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_01
 But if it's international, you should look in Britain, they have different things they can do with TV.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_01
 Or so that you can choose what you want to see.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if you should take that into consideration.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_01
 It just should aim for the normal TV.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think that's better.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_02
 I think if you're going to target a lot of people in the whole world and only Britain, then I think the cost will rise higher than 1250, I think.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I don't know if the...

0:16:32	SPEAKER_02
 It was better to use the whole world in Britain.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_01
 No, it could be...

0:16:37	SPEAKER_03
 I think the main idea of this remote control is to make it user-friendly.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_03
 So I think when the customers will buy this remote control, they already have the remote control, which companies...

0:16:55	SPEAKER_03
 With the standard remote control, which comes with the television.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_03
 So it only has to have the most used buttons.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_03
 You don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television in those...

0:17:09	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, but then you have to find your other remote control...

0:17:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but it's impossible to accommodate all the buttons on the different televisions set on one remote control.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's impossible.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_03
 For example, Sony Television has the opportunity to make possible for it to see on one side of the screen, teletext, on the other side, just a regular television.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_02
 I think most television nowadays do this.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but they don't use the same signal on remote control, because you can use a Panasonic remote control on a phillips television.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but then you have to choose the...

0:17:52	SPEAKER_02
 It's always a universal control mode.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_02
 You have to choose the code.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_02
 I'm choosing the code.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_02
 I guess which type of television you have.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_02
 There's no problem.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_02
 I think the two pages on the same screen, like teletext and normal television, that's nowadays standard.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_03
 I think most people...

0:18:11	SPEAKER_03
 People will buy their remote control because they lost the first one.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_03
 The first one is broken, so...

0:18:21	SPEAKER_03
 Perhaps they haven't got an older television, so that option is not...

0:18:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, definitely optional for those people.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_01
 Then people have a new television, and if you look into the future, then they want to...

0:18:34	SPEAKER_01
 It's very beautiful.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_03
 So we should take that in consideration.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_03
 Mm-hmm.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well, any more ideas?

0:18:44	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_00
 No, I think they'll come up.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well, we have some time.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_00
 One more I have to tell.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think there's much left.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_00
 Nope, we're starting to close.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_00
 Our next meeting will start a little bit early, but our next meeting will start in 30 minutes.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_00
 In the meantime, there's time for some individual actions.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_00
 As you can see, the different roles have different tasks.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_00
 And there's a ping.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_00
 Is it my laptop?

0:19:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_03
 Stop the meeting.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, the meeting will come up in five minutes.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_00
 Five minutes in the meeting, so we're right on schedule.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_00
 The marketing expert will take a look at the user requirements specification.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_00
 The user interface designer will work out the technical functions design.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_00
 And this was the interface designer or the interaction designer?

0:19:41	SPEAKER_00
 No, interface designer.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, first guess was right.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_00
 We'll take a look at the working design.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_03
 No, the industrial designer will take a look at the working design.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_03
 Any usability interaction?

0:19:51	SPEAKER_03
 Industrial design.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_00
 Let's just use the acronyms.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_00
 And of course, specific restrictions will be sent to you for your personal coach.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_01
 So I should look at what you should be able to do with your mouse or how?

0:20:08	SPEAKER_00
 Well, those instructions will be in the email you will receive shortly, I hope.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_01
 Me too.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_00
 And of course, you have your own expertise.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that was what I had to say.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_00
 Are there any more questions?

0:20:21	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_03
 No?

0:20:23	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I think then we have to head back to our offices and start working.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_00
 I have a more question.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_02
 One question?

0:20:32	SPEAKER_02
 Where does it says we have to make a remote because I pursued.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, go.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't know who.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, no problem.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_00
 I'll expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive shortly.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I'll see you all in about 30 minutes then.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_02
 Good.

0:21:07	None
 That's very bad.

0:21:09	None
 Yeah.

0:21:40	None
 I can't do this, but I should do it.

0:21:53	None
 I need to.

0:21:55	None
 Okay.
