 Good morning.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, good morning, everyone.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_00
 Good morning.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_00
 I'd like to welcome you to our first meeting.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_00
 I've prepared a little presentation.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_00
 My name is Marim Plonf, and I hope you will introduce yourself in a few minutes as well.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_00
 I'm the project manager of this project, and well, I will tell you, Ferron, what actually is the project.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_00
 This is the agenda for our first meeting.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_00
 This is the opening.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_00
 Then we will get, I will hope we will get acquainted with each other.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_00
 We'll do a little tool training with these two things.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_00
 We'll take a look at the project plan.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_00
 There will be time for discussion.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, we have to discuss because we have to create a product, and then we will close this session.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_00
 But first of all, I'd like to introduce you to this room.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_00
 As you probably have noticed, there are little black fields on the table.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_00
 You have to put your laptop exactly in that field, so the little cameras can see you.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_00
 See your face.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_00
 There are cameras everywhere around the room, especially here for your faceboard.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_00
 This isn't a pie.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_00
 It's a set of microphones, and there are microphones here also.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_00
 Please, don't be afraid of them.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_00
 They won't hurt you.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_00
 As said, I'm the project manager, and I'm hoping for a good project.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_00
 I'd like to hear who you are and what your functions are on this project.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_00
 Let's start with the ladies.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_01
 I'm Imkriel, and my function is user interface design.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_01
 I think.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_01
 That's me.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_03
 I'm Esteine Maurer.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_03
 I'm the industrial designer, and I hope to look forward to a very pleasing end of this project.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_02
 My name is Danny Magr√≥w.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_02
 I'm a marketing expert.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_02
 I'm my job as a company to promote products to the customers.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_02
 I also hope we have a pleasant work with each other.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_00
 We have some expertise from different pieces of the company.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_00
 As said, we're working on a project, and the aim for that project is to create a new remote control, which has to be original, trendy, and of course user-friendly.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_00
 I hope we have the expertise to create such a project, such a product.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_00
 The way we hope to achieve that is through the following methods.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_00
 It consists of three phases, namely the functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_00
 As you can see, all of these phases consist of two parts, namely individual work parts, and a meeting where we will discuss our work so far.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_00
 First, I will tell you something about the tools we have here.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_00
 I already told about the cameras and microphones, but they are not much use to us.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_00
 We will have to take advantage of these two things.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_00
 They are smart boards.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_00
 As you can see, you can give a presentation on them.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_00
 This one here is a white board.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_00
 I will instruct you about that soon.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_00
 As you also noticed, this presentation document is in our project folder, and every document you put in this folder is possible to show that here in our meeting room.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_00
 And yet, they are available on both smart boards, but I think we'll mainly use this one for the document in the shared folder.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_00
 As you can see, this is the same toolbar as is located here.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_00
 The most functions we will use will be to add a new page to go back and forward between pages, and of course, to save it every now and then.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_00
 This is the pen with which you can draw on the board.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_00
 For instance, like this, everything is okay, but I first put it on the pen.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_00
 You see, I'm new to it too.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_00
 And then you can write things like test or whatever you want.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_00
 As you can see, you have to move it a little bit slow.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_00
 It's not such a fast board.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_00
 It's a smart board, but also a slow board, which you can write things.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_00
 And of course, you can also, when you click here, erase things.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_00
 So we have asked left.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_00
 And you can also delete an entire page, but we ask you not to do that.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_00
 Just simply create a new one and start all over because we want to save all the results.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_00
 Does everyone understand this?

0:06:06	SPEAKER_00
 So you can erase anything.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_00
 Well, you can erase it with the eraser, but you shouldn't delete an entire page.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_00
 You can just create a new blank one.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_00
 I will delete this one now because we don't use it yet.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_00
 But you can, of course, erase when you make a mistake, but don't delete entire pages.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_00
 And you can also, let's see, I think it's here, change the color of your pen.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_00
 For instance, take a blue one and change the line width.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_00
 Five.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_00
 And that's what you will need for our first exercise because I'm going to ask you to draw your favorite animal.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_00
 It's also to guess to know each other because I'm asking three things for that drawing.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_00
 To do it on a blank sheet with different colors, and I just showed you how to pick a color, and also with different pen widths, which I also showed you.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_00
 And favorite characteristic can be just one word.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I'm not very good at drawing, but I will go first and try to draw.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_00
 Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_01
 It's a sheep.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_03
 It's a beaver.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it's weird.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_00
 It could be everything.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe when I put on this thing, it could be a turtle snail.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_00
 Or a snail.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_00
 But the snail doesn't have legs.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_00
 But a turtle has.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_00
 And those are slow.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_00
 And I hope our project group will not be slow, but we will work to a good result and do it as fast as we can.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_00
 Time for another animal.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_00
 Would you like to go next?

0:08:15	SPEAKER_02
 It was forward.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_01
 That is so good.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_02
 Well, to make it a little bit easier.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_01
 It's a giraffe.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_01
 Or a dinosaur.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's easy to recognize.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_02
 This is giraffe.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_02
 The favorite characteristic is the long neck.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_02
 It can reach everything.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_02
 And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_02
 So that's my favorite animal.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_00
 Anything else you need to write?

0:09:50	SPEAKER_01
 I can't draw.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_01
 I can't draw.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_03
 It's a mouse.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_01
 I can't draw.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_01
 You can guess what it is.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_01
 It's a rabbit.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_01
 It's a quick.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_01
 I guess.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_01
 This is my favorite animal.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_00
 I can't draw.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_03
 I can't draw.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_03
 I can't draw.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_03
 I can't draw.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_03
 I can't draw.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_03
 I can't draw.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_03
 I can't draw.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_00
 Perfect.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you very much.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_00
 I can see we have some drawing sounds.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_00
 I have a drawing from the finance department.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_00
 We are hoping to achieve that by aiming for an international market.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 The production costs will be $12.50 max.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_00
 It's time for some discussion.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_00
 What kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control?

0:13:33	SPEAKER_03
 A lot of buttons.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_03
 Complex.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_01
 Not user friendly.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_00
 It's not fun to use in black or black.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_03
 We should try to make it fun.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_03
 We use batteries.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_01
