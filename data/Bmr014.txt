0:00:00	None
 All right.

0:00:01	SPEAKER_04
 Are we going?

0:00:10	SPEAKER_04
 It must be February 15th.

0:00:12	SPEAKER_07
 I think the date's written in there.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_07
 And actually if everyone could cross out the R9 next session and write MR11.

0:00:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we didn't have a front-end meeting today.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_07
 And let's remember also to make sure that once you get smart as unread, unused.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_07
 MR11.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_07
 Lots of clicking on sure as I'm trying to get this to work.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_04
 Agenda.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_04
 Agenda items today.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_07
 I want to talk a little bit about getting how we're going to get people to edit bleeps parts of the meeting that they don't want to include.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_07
 What I've done so far and I want to get some opinions on how to finish it up.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_02
 I'm just going to ask about you monitoring some of the particular topics.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_02
 In listening to some of these meetings for our recorded, there are sometimes big spikes

0:01:32	SPEAKER_06
 on particular things. I don't know what the electronics is.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, well I think it could be a number of things.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_07
 It could be touching and fiddling and the other thing is that it could, the fact that it's on a wired mic is suspicious, it might be a connector.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_02
 Well maybe then we don't really have to talk about that.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_06
 You could try and experiment and say, okay, I'm about to test for spikes and then wiggle the thing there.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_06
 Right, and when they go to transcribe it, it could ask them to come get you.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_06
 Come get me when you transcribe this and see if there's any.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_04
 I'm just...

0:02:08	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, were this a professional audio recording?

0:02:13	SPEAKER_04
 Well what you would do is, in testing it is you would actually do all this wood letting them make sure that things are not giving that kind of performance that they are than to campus use.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_04
 Right, so let's see, I guess I would like to have a discussion about where we are on recording transcription, you know, basically where we are on the corpus.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_04
 And then the other thing which I would like to talk about, which is a real matter question, is maybe I'll start with that actually, Andreas brought up the fact that he would kind of like to know if possible what we're going to be talking about because he's sort of peripherally involved at this point and if there's going to be a topic about, a discussion about something that he strongly cares about then he would come.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_04
 And I think part of his motivation of this is he's trying to help us out because of the fact that the meetings are tending to become reasonably large now and days when everybody shows up and so he figures he could help that out by not showing up if it's a meeting that he's...

0:03:33	SPEAKER_04
 So in order, I think that this is a wish on his part, it's actually going to be hard because it seems like a lot of times things come up that are unanticipated.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_04
 But we could try anyway, do another try at coming up with the agenda at some point before the meeting.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_07
 Well, maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to, like on Wednesday or Tuesday, send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, you want to alter it to that? Sure.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so we'll send out agenda requests.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_07
 That'll be... but that'll help air-brainer or will not help a lot.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I have to tell you for the admin meeting that we have, Lyle, does that every time before the admin meeting and she ends up getting the agenda requests 10 minutes before the meeting.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_04
 But we can try. Maybe it'll work.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, maybe. Where are things have happened?

0:04:42	SPEAKER_02
 I'm wondering if he were to specify particular topics that we'd be able to meet that requested business.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_06
 I would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that, there'll be more things of interest to him.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, actually, this maybe brings up another topic which is...

0:05:04	SPEAKER_04
 So we're talking about that topic. The other topic I was thinking of was the status on microphones and channels.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, actually, I was going to say we need to talk about that too.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_07
 What line do we do that?

0:05:16	SPEAKER_07
 Okay, the new microphones, the two new ones are in.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_07
 And they are being assembled as we speak, I hope.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_07
 And I didn't bring my card today, so I'm going to pick them up tomorrow.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_07
 And then the other question I was thinking about is, well, a couple of things.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_07
 First of all, if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable, we should probably just go ahead and get them.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_07
 So we'll have to evaluate that when they come in and get people's opinions on what they think of them.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_07
 Then the other question I had is maybe we should get another wireless setup.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_07
 It's expensive, but it does seem to be better than the wired.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_04
 So how many channels do you get to have?

0:05:57	SPEAKER_04
 You know, wireless setup?

0:05:59	SPEAKER_07
 Well, I'm pretty sure that you can daisy chain them together.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_07
 So what we would do is replace the wired mics with wireless.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_07
 So we currently have one base station with six wireless mic, possibility of six wireless receivers.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_07
 And apparently you can chain those together.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_07
 And so we could replace our wired mics with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mics.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_07
 So it's still at 15 minus 6.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_07
 So we could have up to 9.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_04
 And right now we can know at the 6.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_07
 And we have 5, we're getting one more.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_07
 And it's about $900 for the base station and then 800 per channel.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, so yeah, so the only, beyond the mic cost of the mics, the only thing is the base station is $900.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, we should do it.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_07
 So I'll look into how you daisy chain them and then just go ahead and understand how that works.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_07
 So we're not increasing the number of channels. We're just replacing the wired, the two wired that are still working, along with a couple of the wired that aren't working, one of the wired that's not working with a wireless.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, basically three wired's work, right?

0:07:13	SPEAKER_06
 I guess three wired's work.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_04
 But we've had more problems with that.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_04
 And this sort of bypasses the whole gym box thing.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_04
 And so we seemed to have a reliable way of getting the data in which is through the Sony Radio Max, as long as we're conscious about the batteries.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_05
 Everyone's battery, okay?

0:07:33	SPEAKER_06
 I'm sure.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_06
 I checked them this morning.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_06
 I should be.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_04
 That's the only thing with them.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_04
 But the quality seems really good.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_04
 I heard from UW that they're very close to getting their set up purchased.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_04
 They're buying something that you just sort of buy off the shelf.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_07
 Well, we should talk to them about because I know that SRI is also in the process of looking at stuff.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_07
 And so, you know, we should try to keep everyone on the same page with that.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_07
 So, are I really?

0:08:05	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_07
 They got a parent.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_07
 No.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_07
 Maybe this needs to be bleeped out.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know how much of it's probably working.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know how much of it's probably working.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_04
 I'm talking about funding stuff.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_04
 But anyway, there's other activities that are going on there.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_04
 And NIST and UW.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_04
 But I think that at least the message we can tell other people that our experience is quite positive with the Sony Radio Max.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_04
 Now, the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you're talking about changing headsets, changing the connector, which means some hands-out or something.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_07
 No, we're having them do it.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_07
 So, it's hand-sortering it, but I'm not doing it.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_07
 So, they charge.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_04
 No, I guess you're doing your hands-out.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_07
 You've never seen my hands-out or anything.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_07
 But, as I've said, they're coming in.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, yeah.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_07
 As professionally as I guess you can get it done.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, if they do it...

0:09:07	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, it's just their repair shop.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_04
 They're maintenance people.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_04
 We'll see what it's like.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_04
 That can be quite good.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_04
 Good.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_07
 Yes, let's go with that.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_07
 And then you will see tomorrow.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_04
 It looks like.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_04
 So, Dave isn't here, but he was going to start working on some things with the digits.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_04
 So, he'll be interested in what's going on with that.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_04
 I guess the decision last time was that the transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_04
 Is that Starters?

0:09:44	SPEAKER_02
 It would be to use his interface now as going to meet with him today about that.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_07
 Right.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_07
 So, the decision was that Jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_07
 So, I did all that last week.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_07
 So, all the forms are now on the computer.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_07
 And then I have a bunch of scripts that will read those and let the transcribers use different tools.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_07
 And I just wanted to talk to Jane about how we transition to using those.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_03
 So, he hasn't set up that they could be efficient than I just did.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_07
 So, I don't think it'll take too long.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_07
 So, you know, just a matter of a few days, I suspect.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_04
 So, anyway, I think we have at least one user for the digits once they get done, which will be Dave.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_07
 Right.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_07
 I've already done five or six sets.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_07
 So, if you wanted to, you know, just have a few to start with, he could.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_07
 And I also have a bunch of scripts that will generate key files and run recognition on them also.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:10:41	None
 Okay.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_04
 It's Dave.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know if Dave is on the list.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_04
 He's invited to these meetings.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_02
 I don't tend to get an invitation myself.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_07
 We don't have an active one, but I'll make sure he's on the list.

0:10:57	None
 Should we call him?

0:11:00	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, you see, you see, he definitely not available today.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_07
 I don't know.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_07
 Should I call him?

0:11:05	SPEAKER_07
 He's still taking classes.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_02
 So, he may well have classes.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_04
 He wasn't there at college.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, so this might be a conflict.

0:11:14	None
 Okay.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_05
 So, did Indy say his signal processing class was like, I think he has Tuesdays and Thursdays?

0:11:21	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_05
 He might have.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_00
 Talking about David Gilbert.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_00
 I think he's taking 225A, which is now.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_04
 So, that's why we're doing team.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_04
 Transcription is beyond the digits where we are.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_04
 And the recording is also just where we are.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_02
 So, should we do a little recording?

0:11:45	SPEAKER_07
 It's the first turn.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, we have about 32 hours.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_07
 I guess a week and a half ago.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_07
 So, you probably now have about 35 hours.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_04
 And that's how much of those digits?

0:12:02	SPEAKER_04
 That's including digits.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_04
 That's including digits.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_07
 So, I haven't separated out, so I've no clue how much of that is digits.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_04
 So, anyway, there's at least probably 30 hours.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_04
 Got to be more than 30 hours.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_04
 Of non-digits?

0:12:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, absolutely.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, the digits don't take up that much time.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:12:18	None
 And the transcribers, I don't have the exact numbers.

0:12:21	None
 I think it would come to about 11 hours that are finished transcribing from them right now.

0:12:26	None
 The next step is to do the recording.

0:12:29	None
 And then to ensure that the data are clean first.

0:12:32	None
 And then to channelize.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_03
 The only clean is that there's a check.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_02
 And the markup is not only throughout, but also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that, uh, Liz requested in terms of, uh, in terms of having us, uh, systematic handling of numbers and acronyms, which I hadn't been specific about.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_02
 Uh, for example, they'll say 92.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_02
 And, you know, so how you could...

0:12:58	SPEAKER_02
 92.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_02
 So, if you just say 92, then there are many ways that could have been expressed.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_02
 And I just had them.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, a certain number of them did put the words down.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_02
 But now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by a gloss.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_02
 You know, Jay?

0:13:12	SPEAKER_06
 Um, one suggestion that you may already be doing this.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_06
 But I've noticed in the past that when I've gone through transcriptions and, you know, in order to build lexiconcant things, if you, um, just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them, a lot of times just scanning down that list you'll find a lot of misspelled inconsistency.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_02
 Just talking about the tech token frequency listings.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_02
 And I use those two.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_02
 You mean, just a, on each line, there's one word, right?

0:13:36	SPEAKER_02
 It's one token from the corpus.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, those are extremely efficient.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_02
 And I agree that's a good decision.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_02
 So you already have that, okay.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that's a way, you know, the spell check basically does that.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_02
 But, but in addition, yes, that's exactly the strategy.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_02
 I want to do in terms of locating these things, which are, you know, locally spoken forms, which aren't the likes of them.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_06
 So a lot of times they'll appear next to each other and, uh, in alphabetize list, they'll appear next to each other.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_06
 Exactly.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_02
 I agree.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_02
 That's a very good suggestion.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_02
 And that was, that's my strategy, praneling a lot of these things in terms of things that need to be glossed.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't get to that point.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_02
 But so there are numbers, then there are acronyms.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_02
 And then, um, there's a, she wants to be, uh, actually, an explicit marker of what type of comment this is.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_02
 So it curly inside the curly brackets, I kind of put either vote for vocalize, like cough or laugh or whatever, non-vogue for door slam and gloss for things that have to do with, if they set us, uh, spoken form with this, maybe this pronunciation, or I already had that convention that I've been asking these people to do this,

0:14:39	None
 because I think it can be most efficiently handled by, by, uh, a filter, and that's what I was always planning on. So, you know, you get a whole long list, exactly what you're saying.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_02
 You get a whole list of things that say curly bracket, laugh curly bracket.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_02
 Then, you know, it's, it's, you risk less error if you handle it by a filter.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_02
 Then if you have the transcribed, laboriously typing in, it's going to be a voc space.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_02
 So many ways that can be error.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_02
 So, um, I'm, I'm going to convert that via a filter into these tagged, uh, subcategorized comments.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_02
 And same thing with, you know, you see, you get a subset, when you do what you're saying, you end up with, with, uh, your claps can cross the frequency, you just have to open, so you can, uh, have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_02
 But the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand, because, you know,

0:15:25	SPEAKER_07
 you don't know what they could be.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, no timents clear, um, and PLP is clear. But, uh, there are things that are not so well known, or, or have variant, you use like the numbers, you could say 9 to, you could say 92.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_07
 So, how are you doing the, I handle the numbers individually.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_07
 How are you doing the, uh, acronyms?

0:15:46	SPEAKER_07
 So if I say PZM, what would it be here on the transcript?

0:15:49	SPEAKER_02
 The letters would be separated.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_02
 Space.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 And potentially they'll have, uh, curly bracket thing afterwards.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_02
 But I'm not sure if that's necessarily clarifying what it is, so gloss up, whatever.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if that's really necessary to do that.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_02
 It's a nice thing to do because of, it then indicating this is, uh, a step away from, indicating that it really is intentional, those spaces are there, indicating why they're there, indicating that it's, uh, the, uh, enumerated, or, I mean, that's not a good way of saying it.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_02
 But it's, it's the, it's a thick, uh, way of stating these, these letters.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_02
 So it sounds good.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_02
 And so anyway, the clean, those are those things, and then, channelized is to then, uh, get it into this multi-channel format.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_02
 And at that point, then it's ready for use by Liz and Dawn.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_02
 But that's been my top priority.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_02
 Beyond getting a channel channelized, the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_02
 And, uh, Tila had a, uh, I've right through this, this last week in terms of getting the channel based, uh, speech-non-speech segmentation, uh, up and running, and I haven't, I haven't been able to use that yet, because I'm working through it. This is my top priority. Get the data clean.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_07
 Have you also been doing spot checks, Jane?

0:17:00	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yes. Well, you see, that's part of the cleaning process.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_02
 I spent, um, actually, um, I have a segment of 10 minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. Good.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_02
 And I went through it last night. It's, it's almost spooky how similar these are.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_02
 Word for word. And there are some differences in commas, because commas, I left in discretion at commas.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_02
 And so, because it's not part of our, our, our needed conventions, and, um, and, um, and it still will be different from commas, but it's, it's word by word the same, in, in huge patches of the data.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_02
 And I have 10 minutes stretch where I can, where I can show that.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_02
 And, and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon, and the other one has a better ear for co-ocleal speech.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_02
 So, um, the one, the, the co-ocleal speech person picked up gobble-dee book, and the other one did, and on this side, this one's picking up things like neural nets, and the one that's good on this vocabulary.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, co-ocleal speech.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_06
 For the person who missed gobble-dee book, what did they put?

0:18:01	SPEAKER_02
 It was, uh, interesting approximation put in parentheses, because I had this convention that if they're not sure what it was, they put it in parentheses, so I tried to approximate it, but it was spelled GA, BB, L.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_02
 Sort of how it sounds.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, more of an attempt to, I mean, apparently it was very clear to her, these, these, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, It was a technical term that she didn't recognize.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but she knew she didn't know it, maybe it was a technical term exactly, but she even know her technical perception is just really, you know, I'm tempted to ask her, is she's taking any courses in this area, or is she's taking cognitive science, or is that right?

0:18:32	SPEAKER_02
 Because neural nets, and oh, she has some things that are, oh, down sample, she got that right, and some of these are rather, uh, I'm excited.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_02
 That's obscure, yeah.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_02
 But ten solid, she's trying to have ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data, and, uh,

0:18:45	SPEAKER_04
 and again, the main track that you're working with is 11 hours, is that right?

0:18:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, exactly.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_02
 And that's probably, uh, 11 hours.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_04
 Is that, is that, that including digits?

0:18:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yes it is.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_04
 So let's say roughly 10 hours or so.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_04
 I mean it's probably more than that.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_02
 It ain't been more than that because my recollection is a minute, and that's not, that, that, that, that just don't take more than half a minute for a person.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_02
 But, uh, the, uh, the total set that I gave them is 12 hours of tape, But they haven't gotten to the end of that yet, so there's still working on some of them.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_02
 Two of them are still working on completing that.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_06
 Quite him, moving right along.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, they are.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_02
 There's some that have more hours that they devote to it than others.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_04
 So what's the deal with your talent thing?

0:19:36	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, it's just I ran the Rekinaza, other speech and speech detector on different channels.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_01
 It's just in this new multi-channel format and output.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_01
 I just gave one meaning to Liz who wanted to try it for the Rekinaza.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_01
 As apparently the Rekinaza had problems with those long channels of speech, which took too much memory or whatever.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_01
 And so she will try that.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_01
 I'm raking on it.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_07
 Is there anything different than the HMM system you were using before?

0:20:13	SPEAKER_01
 I used some different features, but not the basic thing is this.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_07
 So there's still no knowledge using different channels at the same time?

0:20:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's as the energy is normalized across all of them.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_01
 That's one of the main changes.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_04
 First of the other features, besides the energy.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_04
 You said you're trying some different features.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I just used our loudness based things.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 I used to stay before the area where some in the locked domain.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_01
 I changed just to the cube root.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 No, I changed just to the loudness thing you had.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_01
 What do you call it?

0:21:06	SPEAKER_04
 The Trim.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure about the Trim.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_01
 I'll look it up.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_01
 That's basically the thing.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_01
 I tried to normalize the features, loudness and modified loudness within one channel.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_01
 Because they're to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_01
 And it works quite well, but not always.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_04
 I think the re-basic redone with the transcription.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_04
 So I guess the next thing is this.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_04
 We better.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_07
 Right, so the idea is that we need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_07
 To give them an opportunity to leave out sections they don't want.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_07
 So I've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and listen to pieces and they can scroll through and read them.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_07
 And then they can check on each one if they wanted excluded.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_07
 And then it's a form, a single form so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_07
 And so some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue?

0:22:31	SPEAKER_07
 And so I thought about this a little bit and I think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password, a single password.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_07
 Each person will have a single password, username and password.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_07
 And then each meeting will only allow the participants who are at that meeting to look at it.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_07
 And that way each person only has to remember one password.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_04
 I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that have a transcription and sort of flip through it.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_04
 And then if I thought it was okay, I'd say it's okay.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_04
 And I mean, it depends how this really ends up working out. But I guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was okay or not, the meeting to listen to it was going to be extremely rare.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_07
 Right. I mean, so the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that I already had done for other reasons.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_07
 And so that's a minor part of it. I just wanted some web interface so that people, you didn't actually have to send everyone the text.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_07
 So what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready, I would take them and generate the web pages and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_07
 And just tell them, here's the web page. You need a password. So question number one is how do we distribute the passwords.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_07
 And question number two is how else do we want to provide this information if they want it?

0:24:08	SPEAKER_04
 Let's think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say here is it, here is, maybe it sounds peveolithic, but I thought if you handed them some sheets of paper that said, here's what was said in this transcription, is it okay with you?

0:24:25	SPEAKER_04
 And if it is, here's the other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it's okay.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_07
 I think that there are a subset of people who want printouts that we can certainly provide, but certainly I wouldn't want to print out. These are big. And I would much rather be able to just sit and read through it.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, how do you read books?

0:24:43	SPEAKER_07
 Well, I certainly read books by hand, but for something like this, I think it's easier to do it on the web.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_07
 Does your going to get, you know, I mean a bunch of meetings and I don't want to get a stack of these, I want to just be able to go to the website and visit it as I want.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_04
 Going to a website is easy, but flipping through 100 pages of stuff is not easy on the web.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_07
 Well, I don't think it's that much harder than paper.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_02
 So, I have a question. So, are you thinking that the person would have a transcription go strictly through the transcript? Because I do think that there's a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_04
 So, here's where I was imagining it, maybe I'm wrong, but the way I mentioned it was that the largest set of people is going to go, oh yeah, I didn't say any funny that meaning just go ahead, where's the release?

0:25:30	SPEAKER_04
 There will be a subset of people, right? Because think of who it is we've been recording. There will be a subset of people who will say, well yeah, I really would like to see that.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_04
 And for them, the easiest way to flip through, if it's a really large document, I mean unless you're searching, searching, of course, should be electronic.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_04
 But if you're not, so if you provide some search mechanism, go to every place they said something or something like that, see them or get more elaborate with this thing.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_04
 If you don't have search mechanisms, you just sort of have this really, really long document. I mean whenever I've had a really, really long document that is sitting on the web, I've always ended up printing it out.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, so it's, I mean, you're not necessarily going to be sitting at the desk all the time, you want to figure you have a train ride, there's all these situations where, I mean, this how it's imagining it anyway.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_04
 And then I figured that out of that group, there would be a subset who would go, you know, I'm really not sure about this section here. And then that group would need it.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_04
 It seems like, if I'm right in that, it seems like you're setting it up for the most infrequent case rather than for the most frequent case.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_04
 So that now we have to worry about, we'll see if we're going to talk about all these passwords for different people.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_07
 For the most frequent case, they just say, it's okay. And then they're done. And I think almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_02
 The other thing too is, it seems like.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_07
 Because you don't have to visit the web page if you don't want to.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_04
 I guess, yeah, I guess we don't need their signature. I guess an email.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, that was another thing. I had assumed that we didn't need their signature, that an email approval was sufficient.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_06
 Are people going to be allowed to leap out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking?

0:27:22	SPEAKER_06
 Yes.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_07
 If someone feels strongly enough about it, then I think they should be allowed to do that.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_06
 So that means other people are editing what you say.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_06
 I don't know about that.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_06
 I don't know if I like that.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_07
 Well, the only other choice is that the person would say, no, don't distribute this meeting at all. And I would rather they were able to edit out other people than just said, don't distribute it at all.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_04
 But what they signed in the consent form was something that said, you can use my voice.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_07
 Well, but if someone is having a conversation and you only bleep out one side of it, that's not sufficient.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but that's our decision, right?

0:28:04	SPEAKER_07
 I don't think so. Because if I object to the conversation, if I say we were having a conversation, and I consider that conversation private, and I consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_07
 I want to be able to bleep out your side.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_02
 I agree that the consent forms were, I agree with what Adam's saying, that the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_02
 And the other thing is from the standpoint of the lawyer, but it strikes me that we wouldn't want someone to say, oh yes, I was a little concerned about it, but it was too hard to access.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_02
 So I think it's kind of nice to have this facility to listen to it, not in terms of like editing it by hand.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's, some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part by having a document they edited, but it seems to me that sometimes, you know, if the person had a bad day and they had a tone in their voice that they didn't really like, you know, it's nice to be able to listen to it, be sure that that was okay.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I can certainly provide a printable version if people want it.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_04
 And it's also a mixture of people. I mean, some people are, do their work primarily by sitting at the computer and flipping around the web and others do not.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_04
 Others would consider it a set of skills that they would have to gain.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_07
 Well, I think most of the people in the meetings are the former so far.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, the meeting so far. Yeah, but we're trying to expand this, right?

0:29:36	SPEAKER_04
 So I absolutely think that papers, the more universal thing. Well, but if they want to print it out, that's all right. I think everyone in the meeting can access the web.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_04
 No, I think we have to be able to print it out. It's not just if they want to print it out.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_07
 Okay, so does that mean that I can't use email? Or what?

0:29:53	SPEAKER_02
 Because you can send a through email, I think.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_07
 Well, I don't think I, well, I don't think we can send the text through email because of the privacy issues.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_07
 So giving them, you think a website to say if you want to print it out here, it is not sufficient.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_04
 Certainly for everybody who's been in the meeting so far would be sufficient.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I'm just thinking for people that that's not sufficient for what the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and hand it to them.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_02
 It may not be. It's equivalent.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's easier to put the box back.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_01
 Just put the button on the web page, which say please send me the scripts.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_01
 That's interesting.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_06
 When you display it on the web page, what are you showing them utterances?

0:30:38	SPEAKER_06
 And so can they bleep within an utterance?

0:30:41	SPEAKER_07
 No, whole utterances.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_07
 And that was just convenience for my sake that it's, it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we want to do it at the sub-eitorance level.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_07
 Because this way I can just delete an entire line out of a transcript file rather than have to do it by hand.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_04
 There's other aspect to this, which maybe is part of why it's bothering me.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_04
 I think you're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_07
 I mean that's why I did the web form because for me that would be my most convenient.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_07
 I know where you go.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_04
 See, because you're going to end up with all these little patchy things, where really what we want to do is have the bias towards letting it go.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_04
 Because there was one or twice in the meetings we've heard where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_04
 But overall, people are talking about technical topics.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_04
 Nobody's going to get hurt. Nobody's being liable.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_04
 We're playing the lawyers game and we're looking for the extreme case.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_04
 If we really orient it towards that extreme case, make it really easy.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to end up encouraging the headache.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_04
 I think that's sort of psyching myself out here.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_07
 I guess I don't see having a few phrases here and there in a meeting being that much of a headache.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_07
 Well, so.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_06
 I think what Morgan's saying is that easier it is the more it's going to be bleeped.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_04
 And it really depends on what kind of research you're doing.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_04
 I think some researchers who are going to be working with this group as years from now are really going to be cursing the fact that there's a bunch of stuff in there that's missing from the dialogue.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_04
 It depends on the kind of research they're doing, but it might be really a pain.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_04
 And where it's really going to hurt somebody in some way, the one who said it or someone who's being spoken about, we definitely want to allow the option of being bleeped out.

0:32:37	SPEAKER_04
 But I really think we want to make it the rare incidence.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_04
 And I'm just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do and so much fun.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_04
 But they're going to go through and bleep that stuff.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_04
 I think I'm bleeped out stuff they don't like too, right?

0:32:52	SPEAKER_04
 Somebody else, as you say, you know?

0:32:54	SPEAKER_07
 Well, I don't see any way of avoiding that.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_07
 We have promised that we will try them to transcript them that they can remove parts that they don't like.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, so that the...

0:33:04	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, no. The only question is...

0:33:07	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't mean to that, but I just think that we should make it harder to do.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_07
 The problem is if it's harder for them, it's also harder for me.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_07
 Whereas this web interface, I just get email, it's all formatted, it's all ready to go.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe you don't get the access to the web interface unless they really need it.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, I can...

0:33:22	SPEAKER_04
 So, I'm sorry. So maybe this is a way out of it.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_04
 You've provided something that's useful for you to handle and useful for someone else if they need it.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_04
 But I think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that they get access to this if they really need it.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_06
 So you're saying the sequence would be more like...

0:33:42	SPEAKER_06
 First Adam goes to the contact lists, contacts them, whatever their preferred method is, to see if they want to review the meeting.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_06
 And then if they don't, you're done.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_06
 If they do, then he provides them access to the website.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_07
 Well, to some extent, I have to do it anyway because as I said, we have to distribute passwords.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_04
 But you don't necessarily have to distribute passwords, that's what I'm saying.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_07
 Well, but only if they...

0:34:06	SPEAKER_07
 What I'm saying is that I can't just email them the password because that's not secure.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, no, but you have to call me and ask.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_04
 But we don't even necessarily need to end up distributing passwords at all.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_07
 Well, we do because of privacy. We can't just make it openly available.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, you're missing the point.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_04
 We're trying to make it less of an obvious, just fall off a log to do this.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_02
 Not everyone gets a password.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_04
 So what I would see is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it, or to check for it, not just for fun.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_04
 But to check this for things that they're worried about having said, or if they're willing to just send approval from their memory.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_04
 And we should think carefully, actually, we should review, go through how that's worded.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_04
 Then if someone wants to review it, and I know you don't like this, but I'm offering this as a suggestion, is that we then give them a printout.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_04
 And then if they say that I have a potential problem with these things, then you say, okay, well, you might want to hear this in context.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_04
 I think if you need that, you issue them a password.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_07
 The problem with what you're suggesting is it's not just inconvenient for them.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_07
 It's inconvenient for me, because that means multiple contacts every time, for every single meeting, every time anyone wants anything.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_07
 I would much prefer to have it all be automatic.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_07
 They visit the website if they want to.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_07
 Obviously they don't have to.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_04
 I know you prefer it, but the problem is there's a problem.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_07
 So I think you're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping, and I just don't think that's going to happen.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_02
 I'm also concerned about the spirit of the event.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's important to want something, because I think if they feel that it's...

0:35:49	SPEAKER_02
 If it turns out that something gets published in this corpus, that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect, then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_02
 But they might be able to argue, oh well, it was cumbersome, and I was busy, and it was going to take me too much time to trace it down, so it could be that the burden would come back on to a song a little bit worried about making it harder.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_04
 Where you can go to far in that direction, you need to find somewhere between, I think.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_07
 It seems to me that sending the email, saying, if you have an okay, reply to this email and say, okay, if you have a problem with it, contact me, and I'll give you a password.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_07
 It seems like it's a perfectly reasonable compromise, and if they want to print out, they can print it out themselves.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_07
 Well, we can print it up for them, let me give you off of that.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_02
 But there's another aspect of that, and that is that in the informed consent form, my impression is that we offered them, at the very least, that they definitely would have access to the transcript.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_02
 And I know that there's a chance of really skipping that stage.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_02
 I thought that maybe I'm a sort of turpid, and what you said about this.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_04
 Having access to it doesn't necessarily mean having it.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_04
 Having it.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_04
 Having the correct answer.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_07
 Well, the consent form is right in there, if anyone wants to look at it.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_07
 You want me to grab it?

0:37:05	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, but you're wired.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_04
 I asked you.

0:37:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I mean, I don't want to fool them.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_04
 I just meant that every, anytime you say anything to anyone, there is, in fact, a bias that is presented.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_07
 If you agree to participate, you'll have the opportunity to have anything x-anything excised, which you would prefer not to have included in the data set.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_07
 Once the transcript is available, we will ask your permission to include the data in the corpus for the larger research community.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_07
 There, again, you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you'd prefer to have x-ays from the database, and they will remove both from the transcript and the recording.

0:37:41	None
 Well, that's more open than I realized.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_07
 Well, I mean, the one question is definitely clear, anything, as opposed to just what you said.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I know that.

0:37:49	SPEAKER_02
 That's more severe, but the next one says the transcript will be around, and it's really, say, we'll send it to you, or it'll be available to you on the web.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_06
 Thank you.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_06
 I hope it leaves it open.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_02
 How do we get it to that?

0:37:59	SPEAKER_02
 It leaves it open.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_02
 It means also we don't have to give it to him.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_07
 They just have to make sure that it is available to them.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_02
 Is it able to, if they ask?

0:38:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:38:09	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so I think I have an idea that maybe you satisfy both you and me in this, which is, we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded.

0:38:19	SPEAKER_04
 So I just wanted to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impression, gives very, I mean, nothing hidden, very strongly, the bias, that we would really like to use all of these data.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_04
 Right. That we really would rather it wasn't a patchwork of things tossed out, that it would be better for our field if that is the case.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_04
 But if you really think something is going to, and I don't think there's anything in legal aspects that is hurt by our expressing that bias.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_04
 Great, great.

0:38:52	SPEAKER_04
 And then my concern about, which, you know, you might be right, it maybe was just paranoia in my part, but people just, it's, I'm not worried about you making this interface so much fun, and people start bleeping stuff out just because they can't.

0:39:05	SPEAKER_07
 It's just a checkbox, that's to the text, it's not any fun at all.

0:39:10	SPEAKER_04
 Why do I kind of had fun when you played me something was bleeped out, you know?

0:39:15	SPEAKER_07
 Well, but they won't get that feedback.

0:39:17	SPEAKER_07
 No, because it does not automatically bleep it at the time.

0:39:20	SPEAKER_07
 It just sends me, right?

0:39:22	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, good.

0:39:23	SPEAKER_07
 It just sends me the time intervals, and then at some point, I'm going to break them all and put bleeps.

0:39:28	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, I don't want to do that yet until we actually release the data because then we have to have two copies of every meeting, and we're already short on disk space.

0:39:36	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:39:37	SPEAKER_07
 So I want to, I just keep the times until we actually want to release the data, and then we bleep it.

0:39:43	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:39:44	SPEAKER_04
 Alright, so I think, yeah, so if we have, again, let's, you know, sort of circulate the wording on each of these things and get it right.

0:39:51	SPEAKER_07
 Well, since you seem to feel strong as to about it, would you like to do the first pass?

0:39:56	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:39:58	SPEAKER_04
 Fair enough.

0:40:00	SPEAKER_04
 Fair enough.

0:40:01	SPEAKER_04
 Fair enough.

0:40:02	SPEAKER_02
 There's this other question, a legal question that I answered about whether we need a concrete signature or, you know, it suffices or whatever.

0:40:10	None
 I don't know how that works.

0:40:11	SPEAKER_02
 And there's something down there about if you...

0:40:13	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think so.

0:40:15	SPEAKER_04
 I thought about it with one of my background processes, and it's fine to do the email.

0:40:22	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:40:24	SPEAKER_07
 Because they're signing here that they're agreeing to the paragraph, which says, you'll be given an opportunity.

0:40:29	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:40:30	SPEAKER_07
 And so I don't think they need another signature.

0:40:32	SPEAKER_04
 Well, and furthermore, I, it's now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that I do with people on contracts and so forth, that, that, if it's, if it's that sort of thing where you're, you're saying, okay, I agree, we want 80 hours of this person that's such a mouth, and I agree that's okay.

0:40:48	SPEAKER_04
 If it's a follow-up to some other agreement where there's a signature, it's often done in email now.

0:40:53	SPEAKER_04
 So it's okay.

0:40:59	SPEAKER_07
 So I guess I probably should at the minimum think about how to present it in a printed form.

0:41:07	SPEAKER_07
 I'm not really sure what's best with that.

0:41:09	SPEAKER_07
 The problem is a lot of them are really short, and so I don't necessarily want to do one per line, but I don't know how else to do it.

0:41:16	SPEAKER_02
 I also have this.

0:41:17	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's nice you have a view of her here on the web for those who might wonder about non-briple sign.

0:41:25	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, I agree that our bias should be, as I expressed here.

0:41:29	SPEAKER_02
 But I think it's nice to a person could check, because sometimes, you know, the words on the page come out sounding different terms of social dynamics at the end of the year.

0:41:38	SPEAKER_02
 And I realize we shouldn't emphasize that people shouldn't borrow travel.

0:41:42	SPEAKER_07
 I think actually, my opinion probably is that the only time someone who will need to listen to it is if the transcript is not good, you know, if there are lots of mumbles in parentheses and things like that.

0:41:54	SPEAKER_02
 Or what if there was an error in the transcript?

0:41:56	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:41:57	SPEAKER_02
 Didn't get detected, and there was a whole segment against some personal.

0:42:03	SPEAKER_07
 That was all mumbled.

0:42:04	SPEAKER_07
 I think Microsoft is really.

0:42:06	SPEAKER_07
 Exactly.

0:42:07	None
 Sorry, transcripters.

0:42:08	SPEAKER_02
 Or even there was a line, you know, about how Bill Gates and I know.

0:42:12	SPEAKER_02
 But it was all, the words were all visible, but they didn't end up.

0:42:16	SPEAKER_07
 They're going to hate this meeting.

0:42:18	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:42:19	SPEAKER_07
 Actually, Liz will like it, you know.

0:42:20	SPEAKER_07
 But this will like it.

0:42:21	SPEAKER_04
 We had pretty strong agreement going on.

0:42:22	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, that's right.

0:42:23	SPEAKER_02
 So I don't know.

0:42:26	SPEAKER_02
 I guess we're assuming that the transcript is close to an approximation and that my double checking will be so close to absolutely perfect that nothing will slip behind.

0:42:37	SPEAKER_04
 But something might sometime.

0:42:40	SPEAKER_04
 If it's something that they said, they might, I mean, you might be very accurate in putting down what they actually said.

0:42:48	SPEAKER_04
 But when they hear it themselves, they may hear something different because they know what they're meant.

0:42:54	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know how to note it.

0:43:01	None
 Sarcasm.

0:43:03	SPEAKER_06
 How do you indicate Sarcasm?

0:43:05	SPEAKER_06
 No, I'm serious.

0:43:07	SPEAKER_04
 So we might get some feedback from people that such and such was, not really what I said.

0:43:16	SPEAKER_07
 Well, that would be good to get that.

0:43:18	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, sure.

0:43:19	SPEAKER_07
 Just for corrections.

0:43:20	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:43:21	SPEAKER_07
 So in terms of password distribution, I think phone is really the only way to do it, phone an in person.

0:43:26	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:43:27	SPEAKER_07
 Or mail, physical mail.

0:43:28	SPEAKER_07
 We can have their voice mail.

0:43:29	SPEAKER_07
 Any sub word level.

0:43:30	SPEAKER_07
 Any sub word?

0:43:31	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:43:32	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:43:34	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, you could do it with PGP or things like that, but it's too complex.

0:43:38	SPEAKER_02
 I just realized something, which is this question about the possible mismatch of, I mean, well, and actually also the lawyer is saying that we shouldn't really have them, have the people believing that they will be cleared by our checks.

0:43:56	SPEAKER_02
 So it's like, in a way, it's nice to have the responsibility still on them to listen to the tape and hear the transcript to have that be.

0:44:06	SPEAKER_04
 Well, yeah, but you can't, I mean, most people will not want to take the time to do that.

0:44:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:44:13	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, sure.

0:44:14	SPEAKER_02
 And they're observing the responsibility.

0:44:15	SPEAKER_02
 And they have to.

0:44:16	SPEAKER_02
 So it's not, yeah, good.

0:44:17	SPEAKER_04
 But I mean, if you write a meeting and you don't think at least that you said anything funny and the meeting was about, you know, some funny thing about semantics or something, or you probably won't listen to it.

0:44:33	SPEAKER_02
 It is true that the content is technical, and so we're not having these discussions, which I mean, when I listen to these things, I don't find things that are questionable.

0:44:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:44:43	SPEAKER_02
 People's speech are in my own way.

0:44:44	SPEAKER_04
 You think of Bebe Rare?

0:44:45	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, we're not talking about the energy crisis or something.

0:44:48	SPEAKER_04
 Man.

0:44:49	SPEAKER_07
 How about them energy crises?

0:44:52	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:44:57	SPEAKER_04
 I think we're done.

0:44:59	SPEAKER_04
 Kind of done.

0:45:00	SPEAKER_04
 Actually, I was kind of, did you have anything going on?

0:45:03	SPEAKER_00
 Not really.

0:45:04	SPEAKER_00
 No, my project is going along, but I really just shared to follow the project, the overall progress.

0:45:11	SPEAKER_00
 I don't really have anything specific to talk about.

0:45:15	SPEAKER_04
 Is there more to talk about?

0:45:17	SPEAKER_04
 No, okay.

0:45:18	SPEAKER_04
 You know, I've made things.

0:45:20	SPEAKER_04
 Transcribers, he was rattling in the barbells in his brain.

0:45:27	SPEAKER_07
 So we did digits?

0:45:29	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, yeah.

0:45:30	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, by the way, I did find a bunch.

0:45:32	SPEAKER_07
 We should count out how many more digits to forms do we have back there?

0:45:35	SPEAKER_07
 Quite a few.

0:45:36	SPEAKER_07
 That's what I thought.

0:45:37	SPEAKER_07
 I was going through them all, and I found actually a lot filed in with them that were blanks that no one had actually read.

0:45:43	SPEAKER_07
 And so we still have more than I thought we did.

0:45:45	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:45:46	SPEAKER_07
 So we have a few more digits before we're done.
