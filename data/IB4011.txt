0:00:00	None
 I am gonna fix this for quick.

0:00:03	None
 Let's go crippled.

0:00:14	None
 Hmm, okay, I have noERE tablet.

0:00:18	None
 I have a Alright, you okay for someMB Here is my I'm gonna use my very template.

0:00:23	None
 Okay, well, how long is it because we've got a minute?

0:00:30	SPEAKER_04
 That's just the dining room.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_01
 Are you going to take minutes? Yes.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_03
 So, hello everybody. Hello.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_03
 Hello. Hello everybody at the agenda for today.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_01
 Do you have an extra copy?

0:00:51	SPEAKER_03
 Thanks.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_03
 So, the goal for today is to decide for a movie to project at the end of the month.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_03
 So, for this month of April and also discuss the content for advertising posters.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_03
 And I will present you three different design. We'll discuss it.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_03
 So, first we have to decide for a movie.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think we all prepared documents.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, I did.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_03
 So, I propose that we start with the presentation at NIST, the ascent.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so the previous movies that we've done this year were Learn of Arabia, Apocalypse Now, and Emma Deus, which were all historical serious, dramatic, and somewhat action-y movies.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_01
 So, for this month I'd propose doing something different, preferably something set in the present.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_01
 Something maybe dramatic, but slightly less serious.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_01
 So, what I'd propose is actually a thriller or a mystery.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_01
 And while these days people are so jaded by general movies that they tend not to be surprised by the endings and mysteries, some movies in the 90s did actually have twists that people came out saying, I never saw that coming. I didn't know that that was going to happen.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_01
 And so, what I'm going to do is present you two of those movies.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_01
 And before anyone says that, well, if you know how the movie ends, you're not going to want to see it again.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_01
 That's not necessarily the case, because a lot of people like to re-watch movies to see where the clues were, what they missed, things they didn't pay attention to the first time around.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_01
 So, if you can go to the next slide.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_01
 What I'd propose is either the usual suspects or the sixth sense.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_01
 The usual suspects is slightly less mainstream.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_01
 It has a fairly large cast, notably Kevin Spacey, Gabriel Byrne.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_01
 And it was directed by Brian Singer. It's one of his earlier movies, I think.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_01
 It was written by Christopher McQuarrie.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_01
 And according to Rolling Stone, it's the freshest, funniest, and scariest crime thriller to come along since Pulp Fiction.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_01
 This sixth sense, on the other hand, is a more commercial movie with its famous line, I See Dead People.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_01
 It was written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and stars Bruce Willis, Hayley Jule Osmond, and Tony Collette.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_01
 And it's about a little boy who sees dead people, and he sees a child psychologist try to get him to understand why he sees dead people, what it means.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_03
 And actually, he's a psychologist, he's dead.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_01
 Now that you've given away the twist, yes.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_01
 Now, where are the clippers?

0:03:36	SPEAKER_04
 Agnes, I was just wondering, I see, I have here Denise Table, and when they say that it's the freshest, whatever, since Pulp Fiction, well, that's probably not a very long time, because Pulp Fiction is 94, and usual suspects is 95.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_01
 Send your complaints to Rolling Stone.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_01
 So on the next couple of slides, I'll just go through some of the more detailed stuff that we might need for administrative purposes.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_01
 The length for the usual suspects is 105 minutes.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_01
 As Andre already said, it's 1995.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_01
 It has an R rating, which means that, at least in North America, it was not recommended for people under 18, because it's fairly violent, but not so violent as other movies.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_01
 Plot outline, five villains in New York, around it up by the police in an unconventional manner that worries them.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_01
 After release, they get together for a spot of revenge, but someone else is controlling events, and the big mystery of the movie is who's controlling the events.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_01
 It got an 8.7 out of 10 user rating on the Internet movie database.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_01
 It's 16th in the top 250 movies of all time.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_01
 Fourth, in Denise's list of the top movies of the 1990s, which I think was also taken from IMDB.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_01
 It won several Academy Awards, including Best Supporting Actor and Best Writing, Best Film for the British equivalent of the Academy Awards.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_01
 It was nominated for a CIZAC for Best Foreign Film.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_01
 I've got a fair bit of recognition, despite not being a very mainstream high-budget movie, or maybe because it wasn't a mainstream high-budget movie.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_03
 What will be your argument for projecting this movie?

0:05:23	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think a lot of people have seen it. In fact, other than...

0:05:27	SPEAKER_02
 I haven't seen it.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_02
 You haven't seen it.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_01
 You haven't seen it.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_01
 You've seen it.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think a lot of people have seen it.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_01
 It's not a very, very well-known movie.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_01
 It's very well-known.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_03
 It's a really?

0:05:42	SPEAKER_02
 Really?

0:05:43	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's one of the most well-known thriller.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_03
 Really?

0:05:47	SPEAKER_01
 That surprised me. I always got the impression that it was...

0:05:50	SPEAKER_04
 It's hard to tell. So that's your impression.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_04
 That's my impression.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_03
 It's rated for the least.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_03
 How many people have seen it?

0:06:00	SPEAKER_02
 100,000.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_02
 voted for it.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_03
 Only three other movies have more votes.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it seems to be quite popular.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_01
 But I think the main thing is it's got a good twist at the end.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_01
 It's an interesting movie to watch.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_01
 If you go to the next slide, more or less the same thing for the Sixth Sense.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_01
 It's slightly newer in 1999.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_01
 More or less the same amount of time.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_01
 It has a lower rating because it's less violent.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_01
 But it depends what audience we are going to have.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_04
 Is it violent at all, in fact?

0:06:41	SPEAKER_04
 Or it's more like scary or...

0:06:43	SPEAKER_01
 It's scary and I think it has some sort of slight violence.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_03
 But the kid is seeing dead people.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but they're not violently dead.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_03
 No, but it's quite...

0:06:56	SPEAKER_03
 It's more of it and it's creepy.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_01
 It's not violent as in people being sliced in half or anything like that.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_01
 It's 19th in the top movies of the 90s, 100 first in the top, 250.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_01
 It was nominated for a lot of awards.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_01
 It didn't win as many.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_01
 It might have won more minor awards, but at least the Academy Awards.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_01
 It was nominated for five of them.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_01
 But it didn't win. Nevertheless, still a good movie, still a good twist at the end, which didn't he already give away?

0:07:30	SPEAKER_01
 They don't remember.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_01
 Good.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_01
 So those would be my two choices.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_03
 So what was your criteria for selecting this movie?

0:07:43	SPEAKER_01
 It's a sort of different style from the other movies we've seen and they have a twist.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_01
 So it's not your general movie where you just kind of sit through it and go, okay, get up and leave.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_01
 At least out of those two movies I came out thinking, okay.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_03
 But then it becomes a good movie.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_01
 But I mean, that's a good thing right?

0:08:02	SPEAKER_03
 Only because of the end.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_03
 I've heard some people in the theater saying, oh, now I have to see it again.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_01
 Which is a good marketing flaw, if you think about it.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_03
 But then if you ask me to try it twice.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. So is Bruce Willis the child psychologist?

0:08:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, Bruce Willis's child.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_01
 And the kid is really good.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_01
 Who plays the main character?

0:08:27	SPEAKER_04
 It's the guy who then played in artificial intelligence or something like this.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_01
 Same guy.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_03
 So I think, maybe you prepared a presentation or so.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_02
 We can have a look.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_02
 So my presentation is not that detailed.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_02
 I just put their seven highly ranked movies and we can just try to go very quickly through all of them just to remind you them.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_02
 And then we can perhaps consider them as potential candidates.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_03
 It's control.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_02
 So the movies that I have selected as very good, good ranked movies are on the screen.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_02
 So the Shawshank Redemption, Schindler's List, usual suspects, and fiction, good fellas, signs of the lamps and the American beauty.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_02
 So perhaps we can go to the first movie.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_02
 The Shawshank Redemption.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, I didn't see that movie.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_02
 So is there someone else who has seen this movie?

0:09:31	SPEAKER_04
 We know either.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_01
 I've heard a lot of really good things about it.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_03
 I've seen it, but I don't remember it.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_04
 I was told that in French it was called Lise-Vadé.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_02
 The plot outline says that the life of Andy's friend, okay, of Andy changes when he's convinced and jailed for the murder of his wife.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_02
 And the user command says it's simply amazing the best film of the 90s.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_02
 So that's what it says.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_02
 We cannot tell much more because basically none of us should believe this.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_02
 The regime is very good then.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_02
 So the second one is a Schindler's List.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_02
 It's a serious movie.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_02
 It's from the Stevens-Pilberg and it's about the second world war.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_02
 The plot outline is that the Oscar Schindler uses Jews to start a factory in Poland during the war and he witnesses the horrors endured by the Jews and starts to save them.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_02
 User command says a film for all to see and learn.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_02
 And I think it's really something what is very serious team and, yeah.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_02
 So that's a Schindler's List.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_02
 Do you have some comments?

0:10:43	SPEAKER_02
 I have seen it.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's a really good movie.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_02
 It's quite long actually.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_02
 Here I didn't put the minutes but I think it's at least about three hours.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_01
 And it's a heavy movie.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_01
 It's emotional.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_03
 You know if it received some award?

0:10:59	SPEAKER_03
 No, I don't know.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_03
 I think it did.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think it's on that.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_01
 Either for director, if not for best picture.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_01
 But I would expect it.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_02
 I would expect it.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so if you can go to the...

0:11:12	SPEAKER_04
 But yeah, indeed it's maybe too sad and too...

0:11:16	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's a true story also.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_02
 It's a true story, yeah.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_02
 I would say that the user commands everything, a film to see and to learn.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_03
 And to remember maybe as well, yeah.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so the third one is the usual suspect.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_02
 So I think I wouldn't...

0:11:32	SPEAKER_02
 I don't want to comment it again so we can just skip that because this is the one already by Anya's.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_02
 So let's go to the other one.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_02
 Paul Fiction.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_02
 I would say that's like a classical movies of 90s.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_02
 It's directed by Quentin Tarantino.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_02
 It's a crime and drama.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_02
 There are several stories that are just mixed up during the movie.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_02
 And yeah, it's a very classical movie I would say almost nowadays.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_03
 So who has seen it?

0:12:05	SPEAKER_03
 Anya?

0:12:06	SPEAKER_03
 I've seen it.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I've seen it too.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_03
 It's all of us.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_04
 It's very good.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_04
 It's a bit violent but it's also quite funny I think.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_02
 Sure, you can see it several times because I mean the first time you cannot catch all the details.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_02
 And then when you see second times and third times...

0:12:20	SPEAKER_03
 It's the comeback from John Trevaldano.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that was his comeback movie.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_02
 The comeback of John Trevaldano, yes.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_03
 This release is there also.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, yeah.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_03
 Is that...

0:12:32	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, the boxer.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry?

0:12:36	SPEAKER_03
 Fine.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah, Bruce will be the boxer.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_03
 And what's the name of the girl on the poster?

0:12:42	SPEAKER_03
 And Umar Serumad.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so that's power fiction.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_02
 Definitely should be considered.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_03
 So on the list I brought on my document.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_03
 The two movies, power fiction and usual suspects are just swapped.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_03
 Power fiction is actually something before.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, usual suspects.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_01
 And maybe because IMBD is updated daily.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_01
 That maybe.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_01
 So if it happens that people had voted for it.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, because I have did this review on Wednesday.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, me to choose that it's quite surprising though.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's strange with so many votes that they can shift.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, statistically speaking it's strange.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_02
 Good fellas, I haven't seen that movie.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_02
 The plot outline says that the Henry Hill and his friends work their way up through the map hierarchy.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_02
 And the user command says it's simply a masterpiece.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_02
 And if you go to the votes there is quite a lot of people who has voted for the good fellas, 66,000.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, it's still modern the average.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_02
 So it's perhaps not a bad movie.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_03
 Actually I have seen it.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_03
 I really?

0:13:57	SPEAKER_03
 Now I realize.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, now because I thought it was like another movie.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_03
 But it is the movie.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_02
 It was this movie actually.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_02
 And how was it called?

0:14:06	SPEAKER_02
 Mafia.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_03
 Leza Froschie in French.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's that one but it's very violent.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_03
 Very.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't say here but it's probably rated R.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_02
 So it talks about the 1920s or something like of 20s.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's very nice.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_03
 It speaks about a guy who is not Italian who is going up in the hierarchy of Mafia.

0:14:34	None
 Okay.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_03
 So not really in favor of this.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_03
 The mob.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_03
 So the mob is the Mafia actually.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:14:43	None
 Okay.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_02
 Silence of the lamps.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_02
 That's a good father of all Trillars I would say.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_02
 Fully in line with the user comments.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_02
 Basically it's a trill, horror and crime altogether.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_02
 The plot outline says that the Clarice Starling, the young FBI agent is assigned to help find a missing woman and save her from the psychopathic killer with the help of another killer.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_02
 This another killer is actually in a jail and it's Antonio Hopkins and he replaced it very good I would say.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure whether he received some awards for that but it's really.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_01
 Very good performance.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_02
 Very good performance.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_03
 And Judy Foster is very good as well.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_02
 And we can see her actually on the picture on the projector.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_03
 She was pretty young, no?

0:15:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_04
 I think yeah.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_04
 I saw this movie some time ago and yeah she looked quite young.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_03
 From when did it come?

0:15:41	SPEAKER_02
 91.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_02
 91.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_02
 So nowadays she's already 14 years older.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yep.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_01
 That's our we all.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_02
 And I saw this movie when I was like 12 or 13 and it was really a bad experience.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_02
 So I can't remember all the details of that movie but I would like to see it again.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think I've seen it since then.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_02
 I recently I saw the Honeyball, it was a third part actually.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_02
 It was called Honeyball.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_02
 No, it was a second one.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_02
 It was a second one.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_02
 So that's why.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_03
 But not that good, no?

0:16:18	SPEAKER_01
 It wasn't that good but I think it was almost more disgusting.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_01
 It was a disgusting guy.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_01
 There were some scenes in it where normally I don't get queasy watching movies but that was just too much.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_03
 What's your opinion?

0:16:32	SPEAKER_03
 Your seed?

0:16:33	SPEAKER_04
 Oh yeah, I've seen it.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_04
 It's a good movie.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe too well known but since it's 15 years old many people have died.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_01
 A little bit too violent.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_01
 For, I don't know.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_03
 Violent and scary as well.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_03
 Psychopathy, I mean it's okay.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_03
 And last choice.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_02
 And the last choice that I think it's not a bad movie.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_02
 It's American Beauty.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_02
 It's a good movie.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_03
 That's a good one.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_02
 It's basically about the people in America.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_02
 Each of them is, I would say, psychotic in his own way but normally they appear to be normal people as we can see them every day.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_02
 So, and it's really, it's the user command site.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_02
 It's a deep, wonderful penetrating film extraordinary irony in a psychological drama about American life and I can fully agree with this user command.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_03
 And Kevin Spacey.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_03
 It's no Kevin Spacey.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, Kevin Spacey.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_01
 You received something, no?

0:17:37	SPEAKER_01
 Quite possibly, yeah.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_03
 He's actually quitting his job at the beginning but he's simulating a fight with his boss in order to push you.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_02
 He's simulating.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_02
 I've seen this movie but I think.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_03
 To show him afterward.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_02
 And then he fell in love with the friend of his daughter, if I remember well.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_04
 That's really...

0:18:04	SPEAKER_04
 That's the girl who is represented on the picture.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_04
 Theoretically.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_04
 You recognize her belly.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_03
 No, there is this rose because she's imagining her taking bathies with roses all around.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, so you recognize the rose?

0:18:23	SPEAKER_04
 Exactly.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_03
 And I think that's the last.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_03
 What would be your favorite one on this list?

0:18:37	SPEAKER_02
 If you would like to go for something what is really serious, I would definitely go for Schindler's list.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_02
 And if not, then...

0:18:47	SPEAKER_02
 I would like to see this Shawshank Redemption because it received...

0:18:52	SPEAKER_02
 Probably, yeah.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_02
 None of us seen this movie unfortunately but as you can see from your table, there is plenty of votes.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_02
 It's actually, I think it's a movie with the highest number of the votes.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's true.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_03
 And it's Timor-Bins and with the Morgan Freeman.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_03
 Morgan Freeman.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_03
 Morgan Freeman, yeah.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_03
 Great actors.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I see this name of the director on the slide but I don't really know him.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_02
 Frank.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_04
 There are more.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_04
 Many there.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_04
 Never heard of this guy.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but theoretically, I would like to highlight that it's a movie with the highest number of the votes and the highest ranking at the same time.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_03
 Mm-hmm.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_03
 I think we have something.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_03
 It's just, do we want to display the most popular movie or...

0:19:40	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I'm not sure.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I'm not sure.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's that popular in Europe at least because I only...

0:19:47	SPEAKER_02
 You see, none of us have seen it.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_04
 That's right.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, maybe.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_04
 But it's true, yeah.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_04
 We shouldn't stick to only very highly rated movies on this table.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_04
 Though it's a very useful table but...

0:19:59	None
 Okay.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_03
 Do you want me to...

0:20:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_03
 Do you comment your...

0:20:04	SPEAKER_04
 So, yeah, I wrote some notes on saving private try and which is my candidate.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_04
 If you can display them, it's perfect.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_04
 Do you all have a copy of them?

0:20:13	SPEAKER_04
 I do.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_03
 I have some paper copies.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:20:18	None
 You're welcome.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_04
 So, actually given that more or less our theme since the beginning of the year was history, drama, action and given also that, well, we decided to present it.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_04
 To present this month a movie from the 90s.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_04
 I thought that among these movies who look quite popular, saving private Ryan would be a very good candidate.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_04
 Actually, it's a movie I've seen.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_04
 Have you seen it before?

0:20:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_04
 So, you've all seen it.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_04
 So, maybe everyone has seen it.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not very sure.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_04
 But I think it's a very novel treatment of war.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_04
 It's no longer the glorification of whatever, combat and victory.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_04
 But the plot is quite different.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_04
 It's about saving one person who has a special value in the movie, if only because his brothers actually were all killed.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_04
 So, the government believes that they should save at least one person from the family.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_04
 And saving means actually removing from the front, if you remember the plot.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_04
 So in fact, this guy, the private Ryan is not at all the main actor.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_04
 The main character is played by Tom Hanks.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_04
 And it's actually you can see his picture on the second page of my notes, Captain John Miller.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_04
 So, he is sent with this rather strange mission, which is not a combat mission, but they want just to get this guy back.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_04
 Which is, in fact, this guy is, I think, behind enemy lines or something like this.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_04
 So, it happens in Europe, just after the Normandy landing.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_04
 And it's very, very striking the way they filmed all the combat scenes.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_04
 And it's very dramatic.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_04
 It's not like in a movies from the 50s or the 60s, where people will just fall and die anonymously.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_04
 But here, they, well, you see everything and you see how many people die on the day.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_03
 And you enjoyed that?

0:22:19	SPEAKER_04
 The fact that you see...

0:22:20	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it's very strange, you could ask this for any sad movie, did you enjoy it?

0:22:26	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I didn't really enjoy it to see bad things.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_04
 But I think it was satisfying to see that...

0:22:31	SPEAKER_04
 It's very realistic.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_04
 It's very moving.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_04
 It's true.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_04
 It's not very...

0:22:38	SPEAKER_04
 It's not very...

0:22:39	SPEAKER_04
 Well, happy.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know how it would compare with Apocalypse Now if it's darker or...

0:22:45	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it's very different.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think you can compare them.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_04
 So I think this would continue a bit our theme.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_04
 So the movie is ranked quite high.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_04
 If I refer back to your table, it's number...

0:23:01	SPEAKER_04
 What actually?

0:23:02	SPEAKER_04
 14?

0:23:03	SPEAKER_04
 Quite a lot of votes.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_04
 So also one of the mainstream movies.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_04
 On the second page of my notes, I...

0:23:13	SPEAKER_04
 Well I quoted some facts about the movie that I found interesting.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_04
 You could use them for either a poster or a presentation.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_04
 Especially I enjoyed the story about the color saturation.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_04
 It's true that the movie is not really black and white, but the colors are greyish, darkish.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_04
 It makes a very moving effect.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_03
 To make it like an historical movie.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think also to show the...

0:23:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah I think it's the reference to history and also this dark...

0:23:44	SPEAKER_00
 This is the mood a little bit.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, the mood and...

0:23:46	SPEAKER_04
 Darker and...

0:23:47	SPEAKER_04
 Actually, most of the things are quite grey, you know, the uniforms, weapons.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but you get a different impression of you.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_01
 Bright blue sky and bright sunshine behind it.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_02
 But if I read your first point in this trivia...

0:24:02	SPEAKER_02
 I'm just surprised because it says that all the principal actors underwent several days of cruel army training except for the madammon.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_02
 And the reason was that they wanted...

0:24:13	SPEAKER_02
 The director wanted that the other actors would resent him.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_02
 Why this was wanted actually.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_04
 Well I think madammon is the guy who must be saved.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, he's a member of the world.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_02
 And in fact the dying...

0:24:25	SPEAKER_04
 They didn't like the mission.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_04
 Well, yeah, the people didn't understand why they should save one person.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_01
 They're being sent to the front behind enemy lines to retrieve one soldier only because all of his other brothers died.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_04
 So and they are quite resentful because they...

0:24:39	SPEAKER_04
 I mean they feel they should fight, they shouldn't just go there and just get someone and get back.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_04
 And in fact some of them get killed for this guy.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_02
 Most of them get killed.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_02
 Actually most of them.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_02
 There's actually several people dying because of one single.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_04
 It's a very...

0:24:54	SPEAKER_04
 I think some people are comparing it with a Christian message or...

0:24:58	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_04
 But I think it's quite universal and it's a...

0:25:02	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's a modern, very modern...

0:25:03	SPEAKER_04
 What kind of message?

0:25:04	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry I'm not getting you.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_04
 Well this value of one individual looks like a Christian message.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_04
 You know the value of one's soul is compared to others.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_04
 I think I heard this at that point but maybe I'm just wrong.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_04
 So yeah I think it would make a coherent choice.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_04
 It's probably a bit long and we might want something that is lighter and funnier.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_04
 But if we want to keep this idea of history and conflict and also to show some kind of modern treatment of it, it would make for a good choice.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_04
 But if you see in my notes at the bottom of the first page I put some other candidate movies.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_04
 La Vita Ibela is an Italian one but it's also about history and it happens at the same period as Chindel's list.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_04
 And I also quoted Pulp Fiction and Silence of the Lambs.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_04
 A bit more remote from the themes but quite well known movies and enjoyable I would say.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_04
 So do you have any questions about this or should we just move to the next candidate maybe?

0:26:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_03
 Or we have your...

0:26:11	SPEAKER_03
 I have no comments now.

0:26:15	None
 Okay.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_03
 So actually I don't know if any of you have read the document I prepared on the big Lebowski.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_04
 It's just below the table.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_03
 It's below the table.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_02
 I appreciate your table because I found this table really useful.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I wanted to say that it's quite open.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_03
 There are many choices possible.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_03
 But then my proposal is the big Lebowski from the two brothers, Kuan, Kuan brothers.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_03
 And it's actually Joel Kuan who directed the movie.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_03
 The plot is quite up to make but maybe you read it or you understood something from the plot.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_01
 I tried to.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think the summary is quite good and especially I think it's...

0:27:10	SPEAKER_04
 Well, when you read it you just want to go to see the movie.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_04
 I think it looks funny for me.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_03
 I haven't seen the movie but it's a bit like in my opinion like American Beauty because it's a funny movie but it critiques a lot the American society.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_03
 And the Euro, the dude, the big Lebowski, it's actually his name, is a kind of non-hero but is representative of a normal LA guy and he has a friend from Vietnam and another friend who is never speaking.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_03
 They all are together in a bowling club where they meet and they discuss about everything.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_03
 They seem to have no job, I don't know, we never see them working.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_02
 So they're working just to take it easy in the line.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_03
 And actually he's taking part to a kind of...

0:28:13	SPEAKER_03
 Some killers come to his apartment because they think he's someone else.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_03
 And the whole story is about he wants to get some money out of this story and he's going to see the other Lebowski to ask him money because the killers actually damaged some stuff in his apartment.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_04
 Actually, who are the two characters on the poster?

0:28:38	SPEAKER_03
 It's Jeff Bridges and John Goodman.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_03
 John Goodman you have probably seen him in a series now.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_03
 And which one is the big Lebowski on the picture?

0:28:48	SPEAKER_04
 On the right.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so the guy was the guy on the left.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_02
 And the one on the left is his friend?

0:28:54	SPEAKER_03
 Or is that the other?

0:28:55	SPEAKER_03
 He's the one coming from Vietnam.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_00
 From Vietnam.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_03
 And he's coming from Vietnam.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_03
 He's still a kid for war.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay so this movie is supposed to happen in what time?

0:29:07	SPEAKER_02
 I mean it's...

0:29:08	SPEAKER_03
 To movie from the 90s actually.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_02
 The 90s and he's still prepared or still worked as he would come from the Vietnam.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yep, yeah, yeah.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, that's the problem.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to actually...

0:29:21	SPEAKER_03
 I want to show you some posters I prepared for this movie so we can actually discuss at the same time the poster design.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_03
 So on the left you see the main characters of the movie.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_03
 So the hero at the top left, then it's the guy coming back from Vietnam.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_03
 Afterward it's a guy, John Torturo, they are competing with him on bullying contest.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_03
 And Julian Moore and the last one is Buchini or something like Buchini.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_03
 He's never speaking in the movie.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_03
 Each time he's trying to speak the other one are stopping him.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_02
 And this one is supposed to be the second Labofsky?

0:30:07	SPEAKER_03
 No, he's not on the picture, the second Labofsky.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_03
 So my proposition was to add the title of course, some information about the pricing on the right.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you cannot read it very well because...

0:30:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but when it will be printed it will be okay I think.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_02
 But actually I'm a little bit missing some information about our movie club.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_02
 I think it should be some more information.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_03
 We saw it prepared a second one where there is some information at the bottom.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_03
 We can see that do you know about this Montreu English movie club?

0:30:42	SPEAKER_03
 And I said that people can contact us to get part to the committee and select movies.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the text on this one is very good.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, because it's square.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_01
 I like the layout of the first one, the content of this one.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_03
 So perhaps we can some high points.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_03
 But there is a third one.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, I prefer it because it's more colorful.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I don't like the black one.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_04
 The first poster is I think much too dark.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_02
 I think there's too many colors.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_02
 Too many colors.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_02
 Nowadays, you know if you see some advertisement.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_02
 But it can catch the eyes actually.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_02
 But nowadays if you see some advertisement on the street this is typical.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_02
 It's hard to read.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_02
 It's hard to read.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_03
 But then the program I prefer the first one.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_03
 Because I think it's important to have the plot of the movie.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_03
 Especially for a movie people don't never know about it.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, maybe two or three sentences because I guess they weren't stopping for a moment.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_01
 I was wrong.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so what do you propose?

0:31:45	SPEAKER_03
 What should I do for these posters?

0:31:48	SPEAKER_03
 In terms of content?

0:31:49	SPEAKER_01
 So layout of the first one and content of the second one.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_04
 And colors of the third one?

0:31:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, I'll try to do something.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_03
 But first anyway we have to select a movie.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_03
 So I put all the information and you want me to put at the bottom all the information about the committee.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, like what you have there.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_01
 And then maybe replace the paragraph that you had on the first poster.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_01
 With either shorter sort of descriptions.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_01
 Not even of the whole plot but just descriptions of the movie.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_01
 I think the paragraph is too long.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_01
 People don't generally just stand there and read the whole thing.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so just to finish with the big label of skates.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_03
 I think those two images are pretty representative.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_03
 So on the top you see the hero with the cowboy that introduces the movie.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_03
 And on the bottom it keeps dreaming in this movie because the killers put it in the damn or is drinking too much or so.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_03
 Each time he's drinking he's having some dreams very very weird but interesting.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_04
 So the woman on the second picture that's Julian Moore?

0:33:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_03
 Actually she wants him to, she wants to make kids and she's using the big label of skates to have kids with him but he doesn't know.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe he's looking strange.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_04
 So it's not really violent or I mean the movie is quite for general audiences.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah, it's very very sweet and it's like a dream actually.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_02
 How is it actually ranked because I cannot see it here in your game?

0:33:30	SPEAKER_03
 No it isn't in the table actually.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_03
 It's coming at the end.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_02
 It's here 48.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_03
 48.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_03
 But quite a lot of people have seen it actually.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, well at least voted for it.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, vote.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_01
 Hope more people have seen it.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah but generally vote when you have seen the movie, you know.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_03
 Hmm.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_03
 Okay so I think we should decide for a movie now.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe each of us can select two movies or?

0:34:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, let's nominate.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_04
 Let's nominate, okay.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_04
 And then we vote which is from the list.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_02
 So I will take basically two extremes.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_02
 I will take Schindler's list and I will take the big label of skis.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_02
 One of the, one of the mysteries is just funny and from the 90s.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_02
 I mean even the story is from the 90s while the second one is about the second war and the second one is serious.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_04
 Well I'll nominate the one I propose saving private Ryan.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_04
 So history, war, drama and I haven't seen it but I would like to see it and I think American beauty.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_04
 If you think that our series, okay it's not about America but still apocalypse, well yeah, it's about countries.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_04
 So Agnes.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_01
 I'd go for sixth sense just because it's different from all the other ones and maybe Shashank Redemption just because we haven't seen it.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_04
 So Denny are you happy with our choices or would you like to add something?

0:35:07	SPEAKER_03
 No actually I'm happy with the choices because I really, I would really push American beauty because I think it's an easy movie to watch and still there are a lot of things to think afterward and it's representative of the 90s I think.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, yeah.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_04
 So what if we voted say like for a first and second choice and then we count, you can give two points to one and one point to another one.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_04
 Would you like this?

0:35:37	SPEAKER_02
 You enjoy to vote?

0:35:38	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, let's.

0:35:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, start on the.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so I don't want to finish.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_04
 Oh yeah.

0:35:51	SPEAKER_04
 Well it's, well if I nominated two and I was the only one I'll give two points to saving private Ryan and one to American beauty.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, you don't want to finish.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah but then each of us will vote for our nominees.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_02
 So I would propose to vote for us to give the points to the movies that were not nominated by you.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah maybe we can make some.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_03
 That makes us more complicated.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, okay let's.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_04
 Okay so I'll give, okay two to the sixth sense and one to the big Lebowski.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, me I put two to American beauty and one to saving private Ryan.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_04
 I know that you didn't nominate a film so you are sort of freer than us.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_01
 So I'll pick Lebowski and I'll give two to American beauty and.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_01
 One to the big Lebowski.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_02
 One to the big Lebowski.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_02
 Okay and I will give one to the big Lebowski and two to the Shawshank Redemption.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay so it's pretty clear.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_02
 So now try to sum it up.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_02
 American beauty.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_02
 So do we have some American beauty?

0:37:20	SPEAKER_04
 I'm a beauty.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_04
 I'm a beauty for the three.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_04
 Big Lebowski three.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_04
 So you have to reduce the posters.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah that's the only thing that's worrying me but it should be okay.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_01
 Well you can keep it format.

0:37:29	SPEAKER_01
 I mean you didn't have that many graphics in the first one.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_03
 So you select, you wanted actually me to select this design.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_03
 That text on the first poster.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:39	SPEAKER_03
 If all of you can send me one image I can make something on the left.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_03
 Select one image from the movie.

0:37:45	SPEAKER_02
 These images are very nice and they are really representative perhaps.

0:37:49	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe you can leave those.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_03
 With a different title.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_03
 That's the real question.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_02
 I'm, yeah sure.

0:37:55	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_03
 Make something.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_04
 Oh leave Julian Moore.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_04
 I was sleeping for a while.

0:38:01	SPEAKER_03
 No actually.

0:38:02	SPEAKER_03
 She's playing in the...

0:38:03	SPEAKER_03
 No she's not.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_01
 No?

0:38:05	SPEAKER_03
 American beauty?

0:38:06	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_01
 It's...

0:38:08	SPEAKER_01
 Who is it?

0:38:09	SPEAKER_01
 Annette Benning.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:11	SPEAKER_01
 Who's the main character?

0:38:12	SPEAKER_01
 The main female character?

0:38:14	SPEAKER_01
 The mother.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_03
 Looking forward to seeing it.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_03
 We still have to decide for next meeting and we'll also...

0:38:20	SPEAKER_01
 When do you want these images by?

0:38:22	SPEAKER_01
 Just quickly.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_03
 By...

0:38:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah tomorrow.

0:38:25	SPEAKER_03
 Uh...

0:38:26	SPEAKER_03
 Monday, next Monday.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_04
 Um...

0:38:34	SPEAKER_04
 So we have to select a movie for May.

0:38:37	SPEAKER_02
 It should be from this period because 90s I think we can meet at the same period.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_03
 2000s.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_04
 So we'll try a movie from the 2000s.

0:38:47	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:38:49	SPEAKER_04
 And we can meet at the beginning of May.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:38:52	SPEAKER_04
 So I think Monday is second.

0:38:55	None
 No.

0:38:56	SPEAKER_04
 No, Monday is third already.

0:38:58	SPEAKER_04
 Third already.

0:38:59	None
 Whatever.

0:39:00	SPEAKER_04
 Monday, May 3rd?

0:39:02	SPEAKER_03
 First Monday of May.

0:39:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:39:05	SPEAKER_02
 First Monday of May, yeah.

0:39:06	SPEAKER_02
 So it's after the projection and we will see what are the reactions of the people and so it makes sense.

0:39:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:39:11	SPEAKER_01
 How many people we got to...

0:39:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_01
 We can ask people casually sort of what genre of movie they want.

0:39:16	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:39:17	SPEAKER_03
 But then June, what are we going to do in June because we cannot make movies from 10 to 10?

0:39:22	SPEAKER_00
 Uh...

0:39:23	SPEAKER_00
 To start again.

0:39:24	SPEAKER_04
 Some kind of movies that spans across periods.

0:39:27	SPEAKER_04
 I think that is a good day with a lot of quotations from other movies.

0:39:33	SPEAKER_04
 Well, other, let's see when we...

0:39:35	SPEAKER_04
 Kowotofu, yeah, maybe.

0:39:36	SPEAKER_04
 Let's cross the bridge when we get to it.

0:39:38	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:39:39	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:39:40	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_04
 Thanks.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_04
 See you for what's the movie again.

0:39:43	SPEAKER_02
 Twenty-nine.

0:39:44	SPEAKER_02
 American Beauty.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, American Beauty.

0:39:46	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:39:47	None
 Okay.

0:39:48	None
 Okay.

0:39:49	None
 Correct settings, be?
