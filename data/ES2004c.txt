0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 I'll wait till you're all in.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_03
 Welcome back everybody.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_03
 I love you.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_03
 I had fun.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_03
 This is our conceptual design meeting.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_03
 I think we're starting to head over now from the last meeting.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_01
 I was getting the question.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_03
 I think, yeah.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_03
 This is where we talk about properties, materials, user interface and trend watching.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we've touched on a few things to that already, but we'll just go over it.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_03
 The minute from last time, we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_03
 It wasn't going to be a control for everything.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_03
 And that we had to incorporate the image of a company into it from here.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_03
 We have decided on leaving out the voice recognition.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_03
 We've decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what's normal.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_03
 We were thinking a shell, but something along the sides, just a different shape from what's normal.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_03
 We were going to look into the rechargeable batteries.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_03
 And we were going to think about the ports and the alarm for getting it long.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_03
 Things like that.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_03
 And our market was going to be young, business kind of range.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_03
 So she was starting with the first presentation.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_04
 Just connect up.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_04
 So we decided on our market, and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_04
 The methods we use to decide on current trends and so on, market trends, we did our traditional, our usual market research study with our hundred subjects.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_04
 The general feedback from them is that the most, I'm sorry, I'm slightly tongue tied after lunch, sorry.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_04
 We decided on the most important aspect required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_04
 So that was one of the first things we did.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_04
 Also with our company being full runners and putting fashion into technology, we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_04
 So the general findings from that was in market trends, the most important aspects for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel rather than the current functional look and feel of remote controls.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_04
 They also want a remote control to be technologically innovative and of course as you predicted that it should be easy to use.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_04
 Now I should point out that the first of those findings, fancy look and feel is the most important, it's twice as important as the second technologically innovative which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_04
 So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third, it's still important but it's third in order of preference for the subject that we looked at.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_04
 Now the function update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group, we found from our consultants in Paris and Milan who attended all the design and fashion fears then, but fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes, shoes and furniture.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_04
 So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too?

0:05:40	SPEAKER_04
 There also seems to be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials again in contrast to last year.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_04
 So a lot of interesting feedback, they are both in our market research departments and from the people in Paris and Milan.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_04
 You're interested to see what our design people make of that.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, thank you very much.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_03
 Let's start from the inside and work our way out.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, okay.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_04
 Unless anyone has any questions about that?

0:06:07	SPEAKER_04
 Not yet.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_03
 I hate this bit of things.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_03
 I wish if you do them on too tight and you can't get the damage on them to it on the end.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_01
 This is all about the design of the edge components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_01
 First, the into the method, the main idea of the whole thing is just so you just press buttons and it should activate things on the TV and we discussed last meeting.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_01
 It should be easy to find.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_01
 Also in this study, I've looked into the availability of some of the materials because some of the things that we looked at last time, unfortunately aren't available.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_01
 Findings.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_01
 I've got my nice little picture there.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_01
 This is the chip called the TA-1-835, which is what's used in pretty much every remote control because it sends out standard signals based on your input.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_01
 It's pretty much used for all TV remotes at the moment.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_01
 Then we're looking into battery options.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_01
 There's actually no rechargeable option available.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_01
 I saw the standard AA and AAA, which we thought were a bit too bulky at the moment.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_01
 I thought that might be silly to be honest.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_01
 It's basically like wind up radio.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_01
 So you wind up your remote control before you use it.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_03
 How long can you get out of that?

0:08:28	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night?

0:08:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I presume you wouldn't have to wind it very long, but I don't think it's really necessary when you think of the next two options like the solar charging because most people have the light on in the room anyway, so they could get when you've got TV.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_04
 Does light charges us somewhat?

0:08:55	SPEAKER_03
 Is it?

0:08:56	SPEAKER_01
 Is it?

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 Alright.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_04
 It has to be silly.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_02
 Any?

0:09:01	SPEAKER_02
 Regarding the sizes, which one you think will be like because we have to take into consideration size also, so maybe standard AAA might take less space and the dynamo might take more space.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it would.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_01
 The dynamo would take more space because you'd actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_03
 I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think it's parents' perspective.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_03
 But I mean, you don't want to limit your market.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, people who live in base with that.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_03
 There's not that many people.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_03
 I know a different part of the world too.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_04
 If we're at the marketing internationally.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, and most people also watch TV in the night anyway.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_03
 But then it would be charging for the day.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_03
 I think the point is they charge us through the day and then you've got it charged.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_01
 But I think the next one's the best anyway.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_01
 The kinetic charging, which is like you get it in wrist watches and you don't even notice it.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_01
 The amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would charge it up.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_02
 And are this like a, what is the life of the kinetic battery?

0:10:12	SPEAKER_02
 Like it's a transfer long time?

0:10:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it charges into some form of, it's a smaller cell which it charges into.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_01
 And the size of a watch battery because they use them quite frequently in watches.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_01
 And that would last for, well I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_03
 But then if you think about watch, it's on your whole body, it's on your body the whole time.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_03
 So you're walking around you're doing things.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_03
 It is moving a lot of the time.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and you switch the TV on the inside then you pick it up to change it.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_03
 And you put it on the side.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but then again.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_01
 I think it is because if you think about it, the watch, although it's only a tiny amount, it's always moving for the whole day.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_01
 And they don't run out overnight when you leave them on the side.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_01
 And for the same reason you're only using it for an incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you've finished with it.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_01
 It's not withdrawn.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, I don't think the...

0:11:26	SPEAKER_04
 Could I just start?

0:11:27	SPEAKER_04
 Referring back to solar charging, is that compatible with standard batteries?

0:11:31	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, could people put standard batteries in but they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging?

0:11:36	SPEAKER_04
 No, the two things are not compatible.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think you could have a dual power thing.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_01
 But the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_01
 And the other thing that's happening is that they're not only on a calculator, they're quite big and they all look at identical.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_04
 That effect, the idea of design.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_03
 They're expensive.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_03
 The price they were looking at through, I presume, the normal batteries were the cheapest.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the normal batteries would be the cheapest.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_01
 I presume then it would actually be the solar charging ones.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_01
 But I think they're not very resistant to dropping.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_01
 Because if you drop stuff, yeah, if you have the size you'd need to charge a remote, it wouldn't be that big.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_01
 But I mean, if remotes always get thrown around and stuff.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 So I think practically, I mean, calculators you don't really throw around a lot.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 Whereas remotes do.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_01
 They can't.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_03
 Don't care if they just have a battery in the world.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, they do.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_01
 They've got dual things.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_01
 But the batteries are smaller.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_02
 Look at it.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_02
 So which one would last the longest?

0:12:52	SPEAKER_02
 Because we don't want customers to be charging a mobile phone every day.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_02
 A remote phone for like, so.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so look at the life also.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, if you had something using the standard batteries and the solar charging.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think you'd.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_01
 I think the it would well, you know how long the standard double A's would last in order to replace.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_04
 It would just detract from the attractiveness of the whole feature.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think it would.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, can we add in attachment to clothing feature?

0:13:27	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_03
 Can we think about that?

0:13:29	SPEAKER_03
 Because if we're doing the kinetic thing.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_04
 Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in?

0:13:35	SPEAKER_04
 Because I.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_04
 I'd add it in to think about.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_03
 Right, okay.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_03
 Because.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_03
 If it is the kinetic thing.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_03
 And it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_03
 And the kinetic is something people don't do.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_03
 Kind of.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_03
 We're doing something original and different.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_03
 But if you wore it, if it's something you could just click on your pocket.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_03
 Then you would have that less.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_03
 You wouldn't lose it.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_03
 So much.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_03
 But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of it.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_04
 It's not something that's come up in any of our focus groups and market research.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_04
 It's not a thing that people are looking for.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_04
 Let me throw it open to the field here.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_04
 But it's something to put on the side to think about then.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, right.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, well I'll move on.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_01
 My second part of my findings.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_01
 The most current remote used this silicon PCB board which printed circuit board.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_01
 Which basically has these contacts that are really close together.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_01
 And then when you press down on the rubber button, it will connect the circuit.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_01
 And each switch is connected to different legs on the chip and so sends a different message.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_01
 And that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this LED in a sequence of on and off bursts.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_03
 What kind of things do we have to consider there?

0:15:20	SPEAKER_03
 Can we, what kind of size does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size?

0:15:25	SPEAKER_01
 Well, well, the thing about it is that they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can print circuit board like that.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_01
 It's simply spaced like that so you can fit the size of the nine buttons in.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_01
 If you see how thin the tracks are, you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one if you wanted to.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_01
 But there is an option to do it like that or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_01
 So that.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_01
 And then to, yeah, so to conserve battery life, remote should be in a standby mode while not being used.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_01
 And what I was thinking about that was because sometimes when you have these things that got little lights on behind the buttons so you can see what all the buttons are like on a mobile phone.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_01
 They do it more often than on a TV remote, but you could have lights behind the buttons and after like five or ten seconds and not being used, I'd have that turned off if we decided to go for buttons that could light up.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_01
 The case material I've been sent what the factory can actually give us.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_01
 The there's the plastic which I think we were going to go for anyway as the main case case housing and the main problems with the way you could go for wood but I think of it impractical.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_01
 Titanium.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_01
 Very expensive.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_01
 Just the process which to make it is expensive.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_01
 And rubber where you're saying that people like this spongy feel this year so perhaps something made of rubber but I was thinking more of the buttons because the buttons which they've said.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_01
 So they've put across.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_01
 Are what is used in some stressful manufacture and it's meant to be anti RSI.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_01
 The problem with the casing is that there's quite there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_01
 Whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes but whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_02
 So for the flip phone.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah and second question is like mobile you can change the cover.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_02
 So in this case you'll be looking at like the custom making change of color like from green parrot green to chilli red or something like that.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah in titanium I don't think it would be available at all really.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_01
 Well you could make it available in the titanium it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it because of the expense of how much titanium is it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_04
 It does work quite easily too if you let it fall I've got a mobile from myself which is titanium and it doesn't mark very easily.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah I was just wondering if we make the basic mold out of plastic but have like a rubber cover rubber yeah that you give the sponge you feel that also allows us to kind of have different.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_03
 And you can peel them off yeah instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic the fascia that comes from a rubber sleeve almost yeah.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_03
 Like those pens that you get with the grip yeah right that you can that could be a good.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_02
 Okay it would be comfortable to hold on.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_04
 Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_01
 Also the just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_01
 We were planning to do some sort of touch screen.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_01
 Now what I was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare PCB circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colors and say just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_01
 Over if you had them close enough that would be one option.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_01
 The second option they offer rubber buttons but I thought that an LCD type of screen because one they're incredibly thin.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_01
 And don't take on much space to they you can have them in a sort of a rain you could arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_01
 You could have them like a touch.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_02
 So I just read the last part.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_02
 Oh what what just what do you say to adding the meaning of it completely.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 Oh on the on the LCD screen you could you could fit it the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curve things with it.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_01
 But you can you wouldn't have with the LCD you'd have the wires coming off.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_01
 You wouldn't have that with the with the LCD you'd only have that with the printed circuit board with.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_04
 Also it's I don't see why the curve thing is a problem if we for example had a shell.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah you can have a flat screen inside.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just wondering whether we want an LCD screen inside it wouldn't be like full color it would just be black and white.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_01
 But there'd be touch touch buttons so you wouldn't be pressing down on them.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_01
 Or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-IS on.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_03
 I think it would be good to have a contrast between if the whole thing is going to be rubber saying it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy with it inside.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_03
 Now how would you distinguish if you had it bare how do you distinguish where you had to press.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought so.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know if it helps with that but just to do with the RSI is it possible just as an option when we open it up people can use their fingers to press the button.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_04
 Or we have inside like a small pointer thing.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah you could you could have some sort of stylist that you could pull out but I think they could get a bit easily lost.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah it's a little bit easy to replace as well.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to show this very often.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_02
 A person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_02
 He'll find it very irritating to use earlier.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_02
 And he might spoil the touchpad very fast compared to button like yeah we keep punching with and point over.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah just a thought they wouldn't actually need one in the case anything they've got couldn't they have pencil or pen so they wouldn't really need a.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay we'll talk about that so if you finish here.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah that's yeah that's the end of the.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_02
 I haven't forgotten before like you're listening.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_02
 Regarding the circuit since we have having a flip top.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah customize the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_02
 Oh yeah.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_02
 We'll complex button in the distance so we can divide the circuit like that.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah yeah that would be fairly simple.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_01
 I mean you'd actually have two separate.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_01
 You'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_01
 Because in the in the actual flip that you'd have some linking.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_04
 I just raised another point well it occurs to me it kind of applies to both our designers here.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not sure how it would fit in.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_04
 If we flip open now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_04
 And you turn away and it gives like an advertising display.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_04
 You see those?

0:23:48	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_04
 And they kind of respond to the turn of your body.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_04
 Is it possible that when we open our flip top shell it's a little compact mirror.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_04
 And when you press a button it then goes on to the phone display.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_04
 The art there, the remote control display thing.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_03
 We are marketing to guys as much as we are to women.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_04
 They don't look at themselves.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_04
 Just a thought.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_03
 Well it's a remote controller you were sitting watching TV.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_03
 Are you going to want to sort of open it and say.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_03
 I know what you mean.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_03
 So they are using the ideas to mobile.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_04
 So they are using the ideas to mobile phones.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_04
 We kind of got fact tracked onto that I think.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_04
 I'm just trying to think of other features we can build in that we don't cost too much.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_04
 But one would be that one on the side.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_01
 I mean you can't.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_01
 You could do it.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_01
 You could have a.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_01
 Because if you just put the full charge through an LCD display or completely blank it out.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't know if you can get any mirror effect on it.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_01
 I think we forget about the mirror.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_04
 That was just a very quick passing.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_02
 I would like to show something which I did here.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_02
 First thing is basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_02
 Especially from the marketing and industrial design to check on the customer needs and feasibility.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_02
 Second is we check into competitors.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_02
 The picture he shows what are the standard models offered by competitors here.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_02
 So you generally see there is not much of variety and like marketing team said people need trendy they are bored of black and white.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_02
 So you generally see rectangular shape very monotonous kind of designs here.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_02
 And second thing is there is too much of confusion here.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_02
 No particular remote is standard.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_02
 Like some people have here.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_02
 You see this.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_02
 This is on I found that the only common feature is the channel control and the volume control.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_02
 Rest other buttons they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent with other models.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_02
 And second as I already discussed with William we are going to have maybe a GUI interface in the middle of the flip top.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry what does that sound like?

0:25:59	SPEAKER_02
 Graphic user interface.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_02
 Basically which is what we do in computer.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_02
 Have icons or touch pad or whatever.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_01
 If you have buttons that appear on the screen then this LCD screen.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_02
 Like you have an icon or something you have is a good example of GUI and graphic user interface.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_02
 So basically a person you not point or click or press any particular device he just has to click on that particular icon.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_02
 That is simplified.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_02
 And on the top repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device that means user button.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_02
 And he not user pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent circle.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_02
 So we are having a combination of both.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_02
 So on the simpler board on the top we have this button, rubber buttons to keep frequently changing the channels.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_03
 Can you swap that round?

0:26:51	SPEAKER_03
 The ones that we use all the time on the bottom part.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_03
 And what did you think about holding it?

0:26:58	SPEAKER_03
 You would be using your thumbs to press.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_03
 Just like a mobile phone.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_04
 You would flip it open and you would be, wouldn't you?

0:27:07	SPEAKER_04
 Isn't that the idea?

0:27:08	SPEAKER_04
 If we just use the shell as an example again you open that.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_04
 You have your LCD display there and you have the buttons there.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_04
 That is what I was saying.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_03
 But you can't do it with your thumb.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_03
 And then have the LCD at the top and then be able to touch that for the other person.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_03
 And you would have the volume and the program and things like that.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_02
 And the lower the side.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_02
 So the findings are too many cluttered buttons.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_02
 Repetition of certain patterns which I already explained.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_02
 Example the volume and channel control buttons.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_02
 All are confusing and inconsistent.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_02
 There was a mail which mentioned that our division has developed a new speech recognition feature.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_02
 We have to check into the financial feasibility whether we can incorporate this at low cost.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_02
 But for like we had response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_02
 So it could be like where is the remote and the remote answers I am here.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_02
 Some kind of thing or it gives a blip sound or some kind of sound.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_02
 And if this can be incorporated this would be more, you can say trendy also.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_02
 And technologically innovative also.

0:28:27	None
 Yeah.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_02
 So we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_02
 My personal preferences would be like as already highlighted by the marketing department they want something to do with fruit.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_02
 So I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colors.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_02
 Like the vibrant colors.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_02
 Red chili.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_02
 Two mitre red or whatever.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_02
 And second thing is certain standard buttons we should have.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_02
 Like for example if you see the previous slide.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_02
 Wow.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_02
 I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this central pattern.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_02
 Here.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_02
 So we would not change that particular pattern because this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_03
 I can't see that.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_03
 That play in the store.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_03
 This is the central one.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_02
 The one you have volume and channel.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_02
 So keep that standard x because that's the most common feature across all models.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_02
 If you look at all the models it's here.

0:29:32	None
 This.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_02
 And.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_02
 Voice recognition.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure how long we've got left.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_03
 But we need to make a decision about.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_03
 Things we've discussed.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_03
 We agree on.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_03
 Do we agree on the battery?

0:30:09	SPEAKER_04
 Kind of.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_04
 Kind of.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_03
 That means that there's no function for the port.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_03
 You know that it sits in the impression button then having.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_03
 So we could incorporate voice recognition.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_03
 I think.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_03
 I mean if it's like a gadget.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_01
 It is.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_01
 It is quite a cool feature to have.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_01
 And also if they've got it.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_01
 If they've got these parts already in stock.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_01
 Then it won't be cheap to remanufacture them.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_01
 It will be cheap though to remanufacture them.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_01
 So do you recommend a good idea that.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_01
 Where's the remote.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_01
 I'm here thing.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_01
 I think that would be quite fun.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_03
 I think the only.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_03
 I think the only.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_03
 Pitfall that we would have would be.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_03
 How much you've been.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_03
 That means we have to cut down somewhere else.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_03
 But I think pretty much.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_03
 We.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_03
 Is.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_03
 Better to be cheap than simple things.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_01
 LCD is not cheap.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_01
 Well it's.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_01
 Not as expensive as it would be if it was full color.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_01
 Because if it just got black and white one.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_01
 I mean they used them in calculators.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we could start with the black and white.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_00
 That would be good.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_02
 Upgrade later on up.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_04
 We talked about kinetic charging.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_04
 We seem to have decided on that.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_04
 Did we decide on double A or triple A batteries.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_01
 What?

0:31:31	SPEAKER_03
 You went like a backup.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_04
 One of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A or triple A batteries.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_04
 Because they've still got to be charged this way haven't they?

0:31:39	SPEAKER_04
 No the kinetic one.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_01
 Oh I see.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_01
 Come with the sort of watch.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_01
 A battery that goes in the watch.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_01
 So it's a lot smaller.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_01
 So we.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_04
 You're on that okay.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:31:51	None
 Okay.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_03
 Got battery.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_03
 The inside components is pretty standardized across the board isn't it?

0:32:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_03
 So there's not really a decision to be made there.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_03
 The buttons.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_03
 What did you give us as a.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_03
 The bare board LCD.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_01
 I think we were going for the LCD on that one.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_01
 On the buttons.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_01
 On the.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_01
 On the top one.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_01
 On the top one.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_03
 You've got the touch.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_03
 And then.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_01
 On the bottom we were going to have to rub.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_01
 The one that we were going to have to do is just to put the buttons on the bottom.

0:32:37	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry could you repeat that last part?

0:32:42	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_01
 On the flip screen.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_01
 The flip screen.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_01
 The top one is going to be the LCD and the bottom one is going to be the rubberized.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_02
 And for the.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_03
 So the body design I think plastic.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_02
 Plastic.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_01
 For the inside.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_02
 Rubberized padding or for the crypt something like to add to the design.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_04
 So we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell and variety of designs.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_04
 And it is just a little bit rubberized and spongy.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_04
 Apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colors.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_04
 We're not going to try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_04
 I shall be discussed.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_03
 We don't want to be tacky if we've got a different shape anyway.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_03
 The fact that the material that we would be using would be cheap.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_03
 So we could make it red.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_03
 We could make it psychedelic.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_03
 You know we could make it black and white.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_03
 They're prescribed.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_03
 But that's not really what we're focusing on.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_03
 What we're focusing on is the feel.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_03
 So just pick anything.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_04
 Is that going to be the image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe about that size.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_04
 Made of plastic.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_04
 Fits into the power of the hand.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_04
 Rubberized cover that's spongy.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_04
 Is that really going to fit fancy looking feel which was the major thing that people wanted market research.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_04
 Is that something different?

0:34:16	SPEAKER_03
 It's just different.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_03
 It's just different from everything else.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_03
 I mean I'm trying to imagine clean looking houses sort of beige and black.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_03
 Do you either want something that goes with that which is what's on the market anyway or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_04
 Because they're so interesting.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_04
 I'm just kind of pushing it that to see if you came out with anything else.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_04
 But I mean I totally agree.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_04
 We looked at those remotes.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_04
 I mean they are kind of anonymous very similar looking things.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_04
 This would definitely be different enough.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_04
 I just wanted if anybody could come up with something even more.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_03
 And you would just have a cross that you would have so many different options.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_03
 You could do.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_03
 You could have a plain black one.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_03
 You could have sparkly pink glittery ones.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_04
 The things that are upperized covers are going to be so relatively cheap to produce.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_04
 If in a years time we get feedback from the design fears that show something else is coming.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_04
 It's so easy for us to produce that that can be slipped on.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_04
 And what is the beauty of it?

0:35:17	SPEAKER_03
 The ones that have rubbery spikes.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_03
 You know you just go so far from there.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_03
 You could just take it wherever.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_03
 So I think that's quite a flexible.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_02
 And finally the body should be reducible.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe you can change the body of the case kissing.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_02
 The case outside.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_02
 It should be molded with the design in such a way you can change it every time.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_01
 With these rubberized cakes.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_01
 Not the actual plastic outside case.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_01
 Just the rubber.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, we've got five minutes.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_03
 That might have been up for a while.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_04
 So can I just recap, Sarah?

0:35:59	SPEAKER_04
 The decisions that we've made.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_04
 Kinetic charging.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_04
 The watch type batteries.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_04
 LCD display.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_04
 The top side of the flip top.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_04
 Rubberized buttons on the bottom side.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to use fruit and vegetable colors for the rubber.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_04
 Cover the case itself as plastic.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_04
 That's how far we've got.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_04
 We have to add to our decisions here.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_02
 Fine.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_02
 We're talking of voice recognition also.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_02
 Because we have not addressed the issue of how to locate a remote control if it's lost.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_04
 It was just a cost issue with that.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_04
 But it's a good idea.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_04
 We just need to check on the cost.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_02
 Or maybe like the limit we're suggesting in the last thing.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_02
 Some devices you put on keychains.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_02
 Oh yeah, yeah.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_01
 There were so ones.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_02
 The whistle.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_02
 So we can, financially voice recognition is not feasible.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_02
 We could go for a whistle.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_04
 And incorporating the company logo.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yep.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_02
 Have you?

0:37:02	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sorry.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_02
 But we'll be incorporating on the design.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_04
 Because I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from your report.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_04
 It's not just a case of having a little RR hidden somewhere.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_04
 They do want it to be obvious that it's our product.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_03
 Well they do.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_03
 But I think we can.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_03
 Since it's the only one of its kind on the market.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_03
 Well it is.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_03
 I think you just addressed that with advertising.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_03
 You associate the name with the individual product that it is.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:37:29	SPEAKER_03
 And that does the work for you.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_03
 Obviously you'll have a logo on it just like everything.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_03
 But everything else has a logo on it.

0:37:34	SPEAKER_03
 The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_03
 I think it does.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_04
 I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_04
 I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_04
 We just rejected that and people voiced recognition.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_03
 Depending on how.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah depending on the expense.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_03
 I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company is looking into.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_03
 I've got in stocks.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_03
 That seems to make sense.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_03
 But if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_03
 Then it's worth thinking about.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_03
 I think we'll find out more about that afterwards.

0:38:11	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to wrap this up today.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_03
 I got our end meeting now.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_03
 Did it?

0:38:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_02
 So I think we've probably got...

0:38:25	SPEAKER_03
 Instead of closing we have 40 minutes.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we've probably got about that time before we come back.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_03
 See that our family had 40 minutes to discuss what we've discussed.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know how long that took.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_02
 I think we're pretty going in a clear direction.

0:38:46	SPEAKER_03
 Is everyone happy?

0:38:49	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.
