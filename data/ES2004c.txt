0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 I'll wait until you're all in.

0:00:30	None
 I'll wait until you're all in.

0:01:00	None
 Welcome back everybody.

0:01:07	None
 You had fun.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_03
 You had fun.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_03
 This is our conceptual development team.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_03
 I think we're starting to head over ourselves from the last meeting.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_01
 I was getting the question as well.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_03
 I think, yeah.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_03
 This is where we talk about Prov2's materials, user interface, and trend watching.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think we've touched on a few things already, but we'll just go over it.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_03
 The minutes from last time, we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_03
 It wasn't going to be a control for everything.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_03
 We had to incorporate the image of the company into it.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_03
 We have decided on leaving out the voice recognition.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_03
 We've decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what's normal.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_03
 We were thinking a shell, but something along the sides, just different shape from what normal.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_03
 We were thinking, you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries, and we were going to think about the port and alarm for getting it off, things like that.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_03
 Our market was going to be young business, kind of, range.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_03
 So, she was starting with the presentation.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, maybe.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_04
 Just connect up.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so we decided on our market, and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_04
 The methods we used to decide on current trends and so on, market trends, were that we did our traditional, our usual market research study with our 100 subjects.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_04
 The general feedback from them is that the most, I'm sorry, I'm slightly tongue tied after lunch, sorry, I'm sorry.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_04
 We decided on the most important aspect required in an remote control device and we'll come to that later.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_04
 That was one of the first things we did.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_04
 Also with our company being full-runners in putting fashion into technology, we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_04
 So the general findings from that was that in the market trends, the most important aspects for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel rather than the current functional look and feel of remote controls.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_04
 They also want a remote control to be technologically innovative and of course as you predicted that it should be easy to use.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_04
 Now I should point out that the first of those findings, fancy look and feel, is the most important, as twice as important as the second, technologically innovative, which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_04
 So possibly the feature that we put first is actually third.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_04
 It's still important but it's third in order of preference for the subject that we looked at.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_04
 We found from our consultants in Paris and Milan who attended all the designing fashion fears then, but fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes, shoes and furniture.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_04
 So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too?

0:05:40	SPEAKER_04
 There also seems to be a trend towards a spongy field to materials again in contrast to last year.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_04
 So a lot of interesting feedback, they're both from a market research department and from our people in Paris and Milan.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_04
 We're interesting to see what our design people make of that.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, thank you very much.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_03
 Let's start from inside and work our way out.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yep, okay.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_04
 Unless anyone has any questions about that?

0:06:07	SPEAKER_04
 Not yet.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_03
 I hope you did the one too tight and you can't get the new page on it.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_01
 This is all about the design of the edge components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_01
 Just into the method, the main idea of the whole thing is just so you just press buttons and it should activate things on the TV and we discussed last meeting it should be easy to find.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_01
 Also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials because some of the things that we looked at last time unfortunately aren't available.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_01
 Findings, I've got my nice little picture there.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_01
 This is the chip called the TA-W1A35 which is what's used in pretty much every remote control because it sends out standard signals based on your input and it's pretty much used for all TV remotes at the moment.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_01
 And then we're looking into battery options.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_01
 There's actually no rechargeable option available.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_01
 So I saw the standard AA and AAA which we thought were a bit too bulky and then dynamo charging.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_01
 I thought that might be the silly to be honest, it's basically like wind up radio.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_01
 So you wind up your remote control before you use it.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_03
 What kind of long can you get out of that?

0:08:28	SPEAKER_03
 Can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night?

0:08:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I presume you wouldn't have to wind it for very long but I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you think of the next two options like the solar charging because most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when you got to

0:08:52	SPEAKER_04
 the room. So the light charges as sunlight does?

0:08:54	SPEAKER_03
 Is that right?

0:08:55	SPEAKER_01
 Is that right?

0:08:56	SPEAKER_04
 It has to be so many.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_02
 Regarding the sizes, which one you think will be like because we have to take into the solar charging size also so maybe standard triple in might take less space or dynamo might take more space?

0:09:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it would.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the dynamo would take more space because you actually need a physical, so it would handle to wind up.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_03
 I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I don't think it can.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_00
 Artificial light.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_03
 But I mean, that's not many.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_03
 You don't want to limit your market.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, people who live in basement like there's not that many people.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_03
 I know, different parts of the world.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_04
 People are at the marketing internationally.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, most people, most people also watch TV in the night anyway.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_03
 But then it would be charging to the day.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_03
 I think the point is they charge us through the day and then you've got it charged.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_01
 But I think the next one's the best anyway.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_01
 The kinetic charging, which is like you get it in wristwatches and you don't even notice it.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_01
 And the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would charge it up.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_02
 And are this like a, what is the life of the kinetic battery?

0:10:11	SPEAKER_02
 It's like it runs for a long time.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it charges into some form of, it's a smaller cell, which it charges into and the size of a watch battery because they use them quite frequently and watch it.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_01
 And that would last for, well, I don't, I'm not entirely sure how long it would last, but I've never seen one run out.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_03
 But then if you think about watch, it's on your wrist, but it's on your body the whole time.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_03
 So you're walking around you doing things.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_03
 It is moving a lot of the time.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_03
 And you switch the TV on and put it on the side, then you pick it up to change it and put it on the side.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but then again, I think it is because if you think about it, watch, although it's only a tiny amount, it's, it's always moving for the whole day.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_01
 And they don't run out overnight when you leave them on the side.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_01
 And for the same reason, you're only using it for an incredibly short amount of time, so you send the signal and then you finish with it.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_01
 And you put it on it.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, I don't think the drone will see.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_04
 Referring back to solar charging, is that compatible with standard batteries?

0:11:31	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, could people put standard batteries in, but with us, you know, they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging?

0:11:35	SPEAKER_04
 Or the two things not compatible?

0:11:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think you could have a dual power thing, but the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case, and they, because if you, like, on a calculator, they're quite big and they all look identical.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_03
 No, I expect that they were looking at through a presumed, normal battery for the cheapest.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the normal batteries would be the cheapest.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_01
 I presume that then it would actually be the solar charging ones, but the, I think they're not very resistant to dropping, because if you drop stuff, yeah, if you have the size you'd need to charge a remote, wouldn't be that big, but I mean, if, remote always get thrown around and stuff, so I think, yeah, practically, I mean, calculators, you don't really throw around a lot, whereas, remote's do, they can't.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, they do, they've got dual things, but the battery is smaller, I think.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's, which one would last the longest, because we don't want customers to be like charging like a mobile phone every day, or remote control, so.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so this, look at the life, also.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the, if you had something, using the standard battery's anticylic charging, I don't think you'd, I think the, it would, well, you know how long the standard double A's would last in, or it could last a long time.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_04
 It would just discharge from the attractiveness of the whole feature.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think it would.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_03
 It would, yeah.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, can we add in an attachment to clothing feature?

0:13:26	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_03
 Can we think about that?

0:13:28	SPEAKER_03
 Because if we're doing the kinetic thing, shouldn't we do some market research on that

0:13:34	SPEAKER_04
 first before we add it in, because I, I've got to say.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't think about it, right? Okay.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_03
 Because, if it is the kinetic thing, and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape, now the kinetic is something people don't do, kind of, we're doing something original and different, but if you wore it, if it's something you could just click on the pocket, then you would have that less, you wouldn't lose it so much.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_03
 But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of it.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_04
 It's not something that's come up in any of our focus groups and market research, it's not a thing that people are looking for.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_04
 Let me throw it open to the field.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to put on the side to think about it.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, well I'll move on.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_01
 My second part of my findings, the most current remates use this silicon PCB board, which printed circuit board, which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button, it'll connect the circuit and each switch is connected to different legs on the chip and so sends a different message.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_01
 And that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this LED and the sequence of on and off bursts.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_03
 What kind of things do we have to consider there?

0:15:22	SPEAKER_03
 What kind of slides does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size?

0:15:25	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the thing about it is that they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can print a circuit board like that.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_01
 It's simply space-like that so you can fit the size of the nine buttons in.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_01
 If you see how thin the tracks are, you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one if you wanted to.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_01
 But there is an option to do it like that or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_01
 And then to conserve battery life, we're making a stand by mode, while not being used.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_01
 What I was thinking about that was because sometimes when you have these things, they've got little lights on behind the buttons so you can see what all the buttons are.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_01
 Like on a mobile phone, they do it more often than on a TV remote.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_01
 But you could have lights behind the buttons and after like five or ten seconds and not being used, I'd have that turned off if we decided to go for buttons that could light up.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_01
 The case material I've been sent, what the factory can actually give us.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_01
 There's the plastic which I think we were going to go for anyway as the main case housing.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_01
 The main problems with the, well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_01
 Titanium, very expensive, just the process which to make it is expensive.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_01
 And rubber, well you're saying that people like this spongy feel this year so perhaps something made of rubber but I was thinking more of the buttons because the buttons which they've said that they've put across are what is used in some stressful manufacture and it's meant to be anti-RSI.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_01
 And the problem with the casing is that there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_01
 If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape whereas if you come to plastic they can be a little more, they can do curved shapes but whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_02
 For the flip phone.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_02
 And second question is mobile you can change the cover, call it a skin or whatever.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_02
 So in this case you'll be looking at a custom-made change of color from green, parrot, green to chili red or something like that.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_02
 Is that feature available in titanium or it's only specific to plastic?

0:18:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, in titanium I don't think it would be available at all really.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you could make it available in the titanium.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_01
 It would be so expensive to buy a new case for it because of the expensive, how much titanium is light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for it.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_01
 It does not quite easily do.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_04
 If you let it fall I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_04
 I'm just wondering if we make the basic mold out of plastic but have a rubber cover.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_04
 So that you give the spongy feel that also allows us to kind of have different parts

0:19:28	SPEAKER_03
 of it. And you can peel them off.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_03
 So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic the fascia that comes with the rubber sleeve that we've removed.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_03
 Like those pens that you get with the grip.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_03
 That could be good.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_02
 That could be good.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_02
 It could be comfortable to hold on.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_04
 Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_03
 Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't think why not.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_01
 Also just going back to the interface size with the buttons.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_01
 We were planning to do some sort of touch screen.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_01
 Now what I was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare PCB circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and say just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 Over if you had them close enough that would be one option.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_01
 The second option they offer rubber buttons but I thought that an LCD type of screen because one they're incredibly thin and don't take on much space.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_01
 Two they you can have them in a sort of a rain you could arrange the buttons on the screen and it's all sat thing you could have them like a touch.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_02
 Just what you said I didn't get the meaning of it completely.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 Oh on the LCD screen you could fit it the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curved things with it.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_01
 But you wouldn't have with the LCD you'd have the wires coming off.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_01
 You wouldn't have that with the LCD you'd only have that with the printed circuit board.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_01
 Also it's a problem.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry to interrupt I don't see why the curved thing is a problem if we for example had a shell.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_01
 Once we open that.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_01
 You can have a flat screen inside.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just wondering whether we want an LCD screen inside it wouldn't be like full color.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_01
 It would just be black and white but they'd be touch buttons so you wouldn't be pressing down on them.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_01
 Or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-ISON.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_03
 I think it would be good to have a contrast between if the whole thing is rubber saying it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_03
 Now how would you distinguish if you had it bare.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_03
 How would you distinguish where you had to press me?

0:22:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah I hadn't really thought that.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_01
 It's just another idea.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know if it helps with that but just to do with the RSI.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_04
 Is it possible just as an option when we open it up people can use their fingers to press the button or we have inside like a small pointer thing.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out but I think they could get a bit easily lost.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_02
 It's easy to replace as well.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_02
 It's a person who switches channels very often and does use a particular function very often.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_02
 You'll find it very irritating to use earlier.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_02
 And he might spoil the touchpad very fast compared to a button like.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_02
 It'd be keep punching with an point over it.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_04
 Just stuff though.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_04
 They wouldn't actually need one in the key.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_04
 Anything they've got.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_04
 Couldn't they have pancilled a pan.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_03
 So they wouldn't really need a.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_03
 We'll talk about that.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_01
 So if you finish here.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah that's fine.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah that's the end.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_02
 I've never seen before like you're listening regarding the circuit since we have having a flip top.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_02
 We can customize the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_02
 Oh yeah.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_02
 It's a complex button in the distance so we can divide the circuit like that.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah that would be fairly simple.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_01
 I mean you'd actually have two separate.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_01
 You'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them because in the actual flip that you'd have some linking.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_04
 I'll just raise another point.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_04
 Well it occurs to me.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_04
 It kind of applies to both our designers here.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not sure how it would fit in.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_04
 If we flip open.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_04
 Now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_04
 There are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_04
 You see those?

0:23:48	SPEAKER_04
 And they kind of respond to the turn of your body.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_04
 Is it possible that when we open our flip top shell.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_04
 It's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes on to the phone display.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_04
 They're remote control display thing.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_03
 We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_04
 They don't look at themselves.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_04
 Just a thought.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_03
 Well it's remote control you were sitting watching TV.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_03
 Are you going to want to sort of open it in the evening?

0:24:13	SPEAKER_03
 I know what you mean.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_03
 It's like I'm just using the idea of mobile.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_04
 So they're using the idea of mobile phones and kind of got slightly on to that I think.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_04
 I'm trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much but one of the things that we'll understand.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_01
 I mean you can't.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_01
 You could do it.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_01
 You could have a, because if you, if you just put the full charge through an LCD display or completely blank it out.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if you can get any mirror effect on that.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_01
 I think I'll be forget about the mirror.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_04
 That was just a very quick passing thought.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_02
 I'd like to share something which I did here.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_02
 First thing is basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting, especially from the marketing and industrial design to check on the customer needs and feasibility.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_02
 Second is we checked into competitors.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_02
 The picture here shows what are the standard models offered by competitors here.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_02
 So you generally see there is not much of variety and like marketing teams said people need 20.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_02
 They are both of black and white.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_02
 So you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_02
 And second thing is there is too much of confusion here.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_02
 No particular remote is standard.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_02
 Like some, some people have here you see this.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_02
 This is all I found out that only common feature is the channel control and the volume control.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_02
 There's other buttons there in a very disorganized and they are not consistent with other models.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_02
 And second, as already discussed with William, we are going to have maybe a GUI interface in the middle of the flip top.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry, what is that?

0:25:58	SPEAKER_02
 Graphic user interface.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_02
 Basically, which is what we do in computer.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_02
 Have icons or touchpad over to.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_01
 If you have like buttons appear on the screen and the cell CD screen.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_02
 Like you have an all icons or something you have is a good example of GUI, graphic user interface.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_02
 So basically a person need not point or click or press any particular device.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_02
 He just has to click on that particular icon to simplify.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_02
 And on the top repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_02
 That means user button.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_02
 So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_02
 So we are having a combination of both.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_02
 So on this simpler board on the top, we have this button, rubber buttons to keep frequently changing the channels.

0:26:47	None
 Can we swap that round?

0:26:48	SPEAKER_03
 So the one that we use all the time on the bottom part.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_03
 In fact, if you think about holding it, you would be using your thumbs to press.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_03
 Just like a mobile phone.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_04
 And you could flip it open and you would be, wouldn't you?

0:27:11	SPEAKER_04
 If we just use the shell as an example again, you open that, you have your LCD display there and you have the buttons there.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_04
 She holds it on the bottom.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_03
 That is what I was saying.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_03
 But you can do it with the thumb.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_03
 And then have the LCD at the top.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_03
 And then be able to touch that for the other.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_03
 And you will have the volume and the program, things like that.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_03
 And the lower.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_02
 So the findings are too many clouded buttons.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_02
 Repetition of certain buttons which I already explained.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_02
 Example the volume and channel control buttons.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_02
 All are confusing and inconsistent.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, we had a latest finding of voice recognition.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_02
 There was a mail which mentioned that our division has developed a new speech recognition feature.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_02
 We have to check into the financial feasibility whether we can incorporate this at a low cost.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_02
 But for like we had response from the customer that they would like to have the feature of finding it.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_02
 So it could be like, where is the remote and the remote answers, I am here.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_02
 Some kind of thing or it gives a blip sound or some kind of sound.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_02
 And if this can be incorporated, this would be more, you can say trendy also and technologically innovative also.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_02
 So we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_02
 My personal preferences would be like, I already highlighted my marketing department.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_02
 They want something to do with fruit.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_02
 So I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we can take inspiration from fruit colors like the vibrant colors are red chili.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_02
 Two might have read over and second thing is certain certain standard buttons we should have.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_02
 Like for example, if you see the previous slide.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_02
 Wow.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_02
 I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this certain central pattern.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_02
 Here.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_02
 So we will not change that particular pattern because this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_03
 I can't see that.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_03
 That play and stop.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_03
 This is central one.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_02
 The one you have volume and channel.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_02
 So keep that standardize because that's the most common feature across all models.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_02
 If you look at all the models, it's here.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_02
 This.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_02
 Voice recognition.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure how long we've got left, but we need to make a decision about things we've discussed.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_03
 So we agree on.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_03
 Do we agree on the battery?

0:30:09	SPEAKER_04
 Kind of.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_04
 Kind of.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_03
 That means that there's no function for the port.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_03
 You know that it sits in the impression button and having.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_03
 So we could incorporate voice recognition.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think it's like a gadget.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's a.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it is.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_01
 It is quite a cool feature tab.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_01
 And also if they've got it, if they've got these parts already in stock, then it won't be cheap to remanufacturing.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_01
 It will be cheap, so to remanufacturing.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_01
 So do you recommend to get idea that where's the remote I'm here thing?

0:30:46	SPEAKER_01
 I think that would be quite fun.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_03
 I think the only.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_03
 I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it can cost.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_03
 That means we have to cut down somewhere else.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_03
 But I think pretty much we use cheap.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_03
 Well, to be cheap and simple thing.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_01
 The LCD is not cheap.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full color because if we just got black and white one, I mean they use them in calculators.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we could start with the black and white.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_02
 That would be good.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_02
 Upgrade later on.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_04
 We talked about kinetic charging.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_04
 Did we decide on doubly or triple e batteries?

0:31:30	SPEAKER_01
 Wait.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_03
 Do you want a backup?

0:31:33	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_04
 One of the decisions we had to make was whether we had doubly or triple e batteries because they still got to be charged this way, haven't they?

0:31:39	SPEAKER_01
 No, the kinetic ones come with the sort of battery that goes in the watch.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_01
 So it's a lot smaller than that.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_01
 So it would.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_04
 Got you on that, OK.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_03
 Got battery.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_03
 The inside component is pretty standardised across the board, isn't it?

0:32:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_03
 So there's not really a decision to be made there.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_03
 The buttons.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_03
 What did you give us as a zone?

0:32:14	SPEAKER_03
 The bareboard LCD.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the, I think we were going to the LCD on that one.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_01
 On the buttons.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_01
 On the, on the, on the top one.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_03
 On the top one, OK.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_03
 You've got the touch.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_01
 And then on the bottom, we were going to have to rub a rub once the anti-ISI ones.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:32:37	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:32:38	None
 Sorry.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_04
 Could you repeat that last part?

0:32:41	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_01
 On the flip screen.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_01
 The flip screen.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_01
 The top one is going to be the LCD.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_01
 And the bottom one is going to be the rubberized plastic.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_02
 And for the, you know it's for the body design, I think, plastic.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_02
 Plastic.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_01
 If it's inside, for the inside end.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_02
 Rubber as a padding or for the crypt something like to add to the design.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_04
 So we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell and the right two designs.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_04
 And it is just a, although it's rubberized and spongy, apart from that, we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colors.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_04
 We're not going to try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else

0:33:26	SPEAKER_03
 in the shell. No, I think it kind of is.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_03
 We don't want to be tacky if we've got a different shape anyway.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_03
 The fact, the material that we would be using would be cheap.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_03
 So we could make it red, we could make it psychedelic.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_03
 You know, we could make it black and white, there for stripes.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_03
 But that's not really what we're focusing on, what we're focusing on.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_03
 The feel.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_03
 So you can just pick anything.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_04
 Is that going to be the image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that, maybe about that size, made of plastic fits into the palm of the hand, rubberized cover that's spongy.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_04
 Is that really going to fit fancy looking feel, which was the major thing that people wanted to market research?

0:34:15	SPEAKER_03
 Is that slightly different?

0:34:16	SPEAKER_03
 It's just different.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_03
 It's just different from everything else.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_03
 And I mean, I'm trying to imagine clean looking houses sort of beige and black.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_03
 Do you either want something that goes with that, which is what's on the market anyway, or you want something that contrasts as you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_03
 Because they're so in there.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_04
 I'm just kind of pushing it like to see if you came out with anything else.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_04
 But I totally agree.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_04
 We looked at those emotes.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, there are kind of anonymous, very similar looking things.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_04
 This would definitely be different enough.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_04
 I just wanted if anybody could come up with something.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_03
 And you would just have a cross that you would have so many different options you could do.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_03
 You could have a plain black one.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_03
 You could have sparkly pink.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_03
 Literally.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_04
 The things that the rubberized covers are going to be serratively cheap to produce.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_04
 If in a year's time we get feedback from the design fears that show something else is coming out, it's so easy to produce that that can be slipped on.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_03
 And what is another beauty of it?

0:35:17	SPEAKER_03
 The ones that have rubbery spikes.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_03
 You know, you just go so far with it.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_00
 Like a puffer face.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_03
 You could just, you could take it wherever.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_03
 So I think that's quite a flexible.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_02
 And finally, the body should be detachable.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe you can change the body of the case casing, the case outside.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_02
 It should be more loaded with the design in such a way you can change it every time.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah, with these rubberized, not the actual plastic outside case, just the rubber.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, we've got five minutes.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_03
 Or that might have been up for a while.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_04
 So can I just recap Sarah, the decisions that we've made, kinetic charging, the watch type batteries, LCD display, the top side of the flip top, rubberized buttons on the bottom side.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to use fruit and vegetable colors for the rubber, cover the case itself as plastic.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_04
 That's how far we've got.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_04
 What else do we have to add to our decisions here?

0:36:20	SPEAKER_02
 Fine, we're talking of a voice recognition also.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_02
 Because we have not addressed the issue of how to locate remote control if it's lost.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we're just a cost issue with that, but it's a good idea.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_04
 We just need to check on the cost.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe like William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah, yeah, the whistle once.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_02
 The whistle.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_02
 So we can financially voice recognition is not feasible.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_02
 We could go for a whistle.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_04
 And incorporating the company logo.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yep.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_02
 Have you been incorporating in the design?

0:37:05	SPEAKER_04
 Because I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from your report.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_04
 It's not just a case of having a little RR hidden somewhere.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_04
 They do want it to be obvious that it's our product.

0:37:15	SPEAKER_03
 Well, they do, but I think we can.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_03
 It's the only one of its kind on the market.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_03
 I think you just addressed that with advertising.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_03
 You associate the name with the individual product that it is.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:37:29	SPEAKER_03
 And that doesn't work for you.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_03
 Obviously you'll have a logo on it, just like everything.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_03
 But everything else has a logo on it.

0:37:34	SPEAKER_03
 The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_03
 I think it does.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_03
 And that's why I find that.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_04
 Did we, I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_04
 I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_04
 Have we just rejected that beeper voice recognition?

0:37:49	SPEAKER_03
 Depending on how...

0:37:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, depending on the expense of it.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company is looking into.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_03
 I've got in stocks.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_03
 That seems to make sense.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_03
 But if it turns out that it's hugely expensive, we'd have to cut down somewhere else.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_03
 Then it's worth thinking about.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_03
 But I think we'll find out more about the market afterwards.

0:38:11	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to wrap it up saying.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_03
 I've got an end meeting now.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_02
 Did it?

0:38:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_02
 I've been a bushing here, huh?

0:38:24	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we've probably got...

0:38:26	SPEAKER_03
 Instead of going to the same thing, we have 40 minutes.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we've probably got about that time before we come back.

0:38:33	SPEAKER_03
 See that that, or we only had 40 minutes to discuss what we've discussed.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know how long that took.

0:38:41	SPEAKER_02
 I think we're pretty going in a clear direction now.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_03
 Is everyone happy?

0:38:46	SPEAKER_03
 Left is good.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_03
 Left is good.

0:38:50	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_03
 OK.
