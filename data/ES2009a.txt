0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 I think I should probably try to sit up straight.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_00
 Like that?

0:00:19	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, cool.

0:00:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay?

0:00:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:00:31	None
 Okay.

0:00:32	None
 Okay.

0:00:33	None
 Okay.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm just going to start this PowerPoint real quick.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_03
 Powerpoint.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_03
 Very official.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_04
 Wow.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_00
 I kind of like this.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_00
 Kind of getting into it.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_00
 So just to kick off the meeting basically.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_00
 So we're working now for a real reaction.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_00
 This is.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_00
 It's got an agenda to set out.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_00
 What we're going to try to accomplish in this particular first meeting.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_00
 Then we're going to start to talk a little bit about tool training.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_00
 Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_00
 The whiteboard.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_00
 We've got a general plan for the project.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_00
 How we're going to go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion and close up.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_00
 IRL.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_00
 You guys, you know, gamers lying in real life.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_00
 So yeah, basically, I want to.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just going to.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_00
 You got, of course, we can discuss that.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_00
 I'm thinking about proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask, don't tell.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_00
 So if you say something about marketing, right, sort of.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just going to believe in you.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_00
 I'll go from there.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, if you guys at the same time, if you like logically, if something doesn't, like I'm like, we're going to sell remote control that's the size of this paper book, you know.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_00
 You said like, well, that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_00
 Obviously go with it.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_00
 I'm and we'll discuss it.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_00
 But I'm not going to ask, do you know that?

0:02:39	SPEAKER_00
 Or it seems like.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_00
 So because we're sort of roleplanes, you're going to tap into your own knowledge as well.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_00
 And that's the same for you when we do introductions.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, and you talk about your background, you know, have fun.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_00
 You know, maybe you went to, you know, maybe you're like me and you went to UCSB, but you want to say you went to Harvard or something like that.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_00
 Why not?

0:03:02	SPEAKER_00
 You know, you can, this is, you know, I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_00
 So are you guys okay with that?

0:03:06	SPEAKER_00
 Does that seem logical?

0:03:07	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah, that's fine.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_02
 It's going to work for me.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_03
 It's sweet.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_02
 Cool.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_00
 So I guess the, we're totally, we're making a remote control, which is thrilling.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_00
 But the idea is that we can make something based on the whole covert motto.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if you guys had time to check the, in real life, I don't know if you guys would have checked the, the corporate website.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_00
 We've got to make something as fashionable as possible.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_00
 That's kind of the corporate strategies.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_00
 You know, like John Lewis nicer, you know, if you go to Devon M's or something.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_00
 So basically we are reinventing the wheel, but we want to try to do it in a user friendly slick, sleek kind of way.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_00
 What we're going to go about doing that is basically at first we're going to start on the basics.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_00
 And that's where I'm going to need you guys to use your interface designers and the, the other designer that I can't remember the, the idea and the you idea, right?

0:04:18	SPEAKER_00
 The industrial designer, hey, I'm getting into it to guide me and guide us on this project.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_00
 Because you're going to be, you're, you got, you guys at the bottom, you know, you're like, no, you can't do that.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_00
 You can't have, you know, X and Y at the same time.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_00
 And then we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_00
 You know, like, I think you guys probably got the same email as I did, but the idea of, yes, a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_00
 But it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_00
 So that if you touch it, you hurt your hand or something like that.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_00
 And so we'll work up from there and then we'll meet on and talk about it.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_00
 And then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage in a way you guys build or tell me to tell us what's possible in the new tell.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_00
 And you tell us what we can hope for and what way to go take the, take the basics and make it nicer.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_00
 And then obviously the UID and the ID, you know, you can keep on, you know, cutting edge of how to get about maximizing what is possible to try to sink it all up.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_00
 So that's the detailed design. So it's a three stage kind of thing.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_00
 Right. So for now, just for the whiteboard, basically, just to get used to it, I haven't tried it yet either.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just going to start and carry like five remote around.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_00
 And just write down, I'm just going to write down one of the names of my desert disks.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_00
 You know, if you were trapped on a desert island and you can only bring five CDs along with you, name one of them that you could not all five.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_00
 If you want to write all five, go for it. But name one of them that you could, oh, we skipped introductions.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_00
 Nice. I'm an excellent project manager. I'm Marty.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_00
 I went to uni at UC Santa Barbara and I'm here working on a PhD in psychology.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. So.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_03
 I'm Sarah. I went to Michigan and I'm here to cultural studies.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_03
 And I'm marketing manager or something marketing expert.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_00
 Don't play yourself down. I'm Ron.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_01
 I once upon a time studied in Victoria and I am the user interface designer.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_02
 I'm Nathan. I'm from California and I'm here doing a master screen social college.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_02
 Where'd you go to get any news? You see.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to bring my little brother goes there.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_00
 Right. So desert island disks.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_03
 So we have to wait for you to write it down. Are you going to tell us?

0:06:59	SPEAKER_00
 Well, no, no, I'm just going to write a couple of them down. See, I'm a big music fan.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if you guys are. I'm assuming everybody likes music.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_00
 It's some lesser, greater extent. But there's some other options.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_00
 If you're a TV slut like I am like small, though terrible television show, but I happen to love it.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_03
 It's rubbish, but I love it. I went to high school with Tom willing, actually.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_00
 The main thing. The guy. Wow. Yeah.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_03
 He's a wanker. Yeah. Very much so. I love a soccer player, but a total bastard.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_00
 He looks really tall. Like he's got to be like six six. He's a big guy.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. Okay. So I really like Jeff Buckley.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_00
 You guys are Jeff Buckley.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_00
 That's cool because like not very many people have.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_00
 And oh, well, I'm at his will throw a British person in there.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_00
 You can't go wrong with radio.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_03
 It's a good call.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. So it really works just like a panel.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_00
 It makes noises, I think. It's kind of weird.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway, yeah. Yeah. You like pressing those.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_00
 You'll see. All right. So whoever wants to get up next, you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_00
 I guess I'll go next. Right on.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. We lose all my mics plugged in here.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. This is basically just pen practice.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. Oh, you're much taller than me.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm going to write down here.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_03
 Right now I'm listening to a lot of somebody knows ever heard of Chris Bathgate, local Michigan folk singer.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_03
 Nice. Really lame. And what else can I bring with me?

0:08:41	SPEAKER_03
 Probably classical to Tony Leake.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. Yeah. I think.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_03
 And my family guide DVDs.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_03
 Well, yeah. We don't need to write that one down.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, family guy.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_00
 Do you watch the new season?

0:08:54	SPEAKER_03
 No. Are you getting it online or is it?

0:08:57	SPEAKER_03
 I think I'm going to start downloading it.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. That'd be nice.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just going to put down one.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_01
 One CD.

0:09:12	None
 Okay.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_01
 Anybody?

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 Afrobeat orchestra.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_01
 Afrobeat orchestra.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_01
 Very cool.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_01
 Like 15 members from Brooklyn.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_01
 And I'm hoping to go to the concert in Belgium.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_01
 Wow.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_01
 I think I love about.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't read those.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_03
 It's what a PowerPoint.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_00
 They're designed specifically to ignore.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_03
 It's the five by five.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_00
 I can't read that much.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_04
 Street pizza.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_03
 Love.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_03
 It's so horrible.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_00
 I've seen more urine in this city than ever before.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_01
 I'm really happy to see that.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_01
 I'm really happy to see that.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_01
 I just came from Glasgow.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_00
 I'm happy to say that there's a same quantity of approximately.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_01
 It's so mean.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_01
 It really is.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_04
 Does.

0:10:23	None
 Yeah.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_00
 Mingen.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_00
 Nice.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_00
 I have to be here for three years.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to look at the terminology.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_03
 I've already got more than I can keep track of.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to be like, oh my god.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_03
 You're turning into one of those people.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_00
 Have you been home yet?

0:10:38	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_00
 They'll be like, say something British and you're like, oh, shut up.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, it should be interesting.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_03
 We can tell I tell them not to come back.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_00
 You're going to say here.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_03
 Probably.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_03
 Or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_02
 Is that religion?

0:10:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_02
 Some music I grew up listening to.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_03
 Now I can think of somebody other one.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_02
 Well, yeah, that's why.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_02
 Something I miss about my hometown.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_00
 I miss coffee.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_00
 Burritos.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_00
 Burritos.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_02
 Oh.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_02
 The cost less than two bucks.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_02
 Two bucks.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_02
 Two bucks.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_02
 I think things that are like.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_02
 Where are you from in California, by the way?

0:11:18	SPEAKER_02
 I grew up in San Diego.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_00
 I'm from San Diego as well.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_02
 I'm from San Diego.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_02
 I was really.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_02
 I last lived in San Francisco.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_02
 I haven't lived in California since I was 18.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_00
 I was 18.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_00
 You know, I think I'm sorry.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_00
 You just can't get a bit of burrito than what's available in San Diego.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_02
 It's different because in San Diego the tortillas are cooked on the grill.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_02
 You know the California they steam them.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_03
 It must make all the difference.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, really does.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it's, there's other things to this.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_00
 You just can't place it like I went into school in Santa Barbara, which is Central California.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_00
 The Mexican food is okay.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_00
 It's just not good.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_00
 Like.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_00
 And yeah, it's like two bucks.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_00
 Like literally two bucks.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_00
 for this mask.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_00
 I miss.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_00
 Good call on that.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_00
 Where are you from in San Diego?

0:12:06	SPEAKER_00
 Just literally just metropolitan San Diego.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_00
 I live like five minutes from the zoo.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_00
 So North Park, actually, if you want to get your wristband.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, my grandparents lived on a 30 second.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yep.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_02
 Close to, you know, we're a Clare de Linde coffee shop.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_00
 Un University.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's actually like literally half a mile from my house.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 Cool.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, pretty cool.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_00
 Small world.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_00
 You know, we're all from the same general region.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_00
 So, okay.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_00
 Success on the whiteboard.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_00
 You can harness the awesome power.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_00
 A little bit of interactions.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_00
 We talked about some of our CDs and things we like about the city.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_00
 I think we'll.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_00
 So moving on to not fun stuff.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 Project finance.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_00
 Basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for 25 euros.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_00
 This is what the finance department has told me the CFO.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_00
 But I don't know.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sold on this.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_00
 It's pretty dear.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, 20.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_00
 That's like, you know, 40 bucks for a remote.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_00
 It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_00
 So we can maybe work on that later.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_00
 But we're going to make a lot on it.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_00
 The profit aims to make 50 million euros on it.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_00
 You're internationally.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_00
 So one of the things I was going to mention to you, you guys, the designers is that we probably need a room.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_00
 It needs to be a universal remote control probably.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_00
 So something that could do NTSC as well as PAL as well as various other formats.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's going to control DVDs.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_00
 But, you know, I'll leave that to you guys.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_00
 But that's something that is going to be an international sold thing.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_00
 But we want to try to make it for 1250.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_00
 So we want to try to make 100% profit on it if we can.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_00
 So just to close up, I'm not sure how much time I've used it next time.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_00
 Project manager sort of is.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_00
 Because I will meet another half an hour or so.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_00
 And I'd like the industrial designer to get, think about what needs to be done, like what the basic function of it.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_00
 UID, well, yeah, your assignments are up there.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_00
 And you'll also get assignments from in your email as well, more specific on what to do.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_00
 Basically, I need you to tell us what we, what the user is going to want.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_00
 So actually, in a way, you guys, maybe in our next meeting, chat a bit about what the user is going to want and what the user can have.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_00
 You know, like, you go and shape that.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, well, it is.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_00
 And we'll discuss the trade-offs in between.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_00
 And so, yeah, specific instructions will be sent in your email.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_00
 But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_00
 And there's more things come up.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_00
 We'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_00
 Any questions before we get started?

0:14:50	SPEAKER_01
 I assume that we're building a standalone remote control.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_01
 We can't kind of build it into other products.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_01
 You mean to like, for instance, like a mobile phone?

0:15:05	SPEAKER_02
 It's interesting.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think there's any rules about it yet.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe our personal coach will.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_01
 Or, you know, can we produce, can we sell a remote control phone for just a few months?

0:15:19	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, we can't sell a remote control phone for 25 pounds.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I have a think about it.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, I'm certainly open.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_00
 It seems like, yeah, it seems like it's certainly doable, isn't it?

0:15:28	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, or if we can't have a full mobile phone, maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_00
 The clap.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_00
 No, I mean.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_00
 No, good idea.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_00
 Good idea.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_02
 Let's see.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_02
 Every remote will changeable faces like face-leaf by face.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_00
 I like that.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_00
 I like that.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_00
 I guess we probably have some time.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we want to do.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_00
 Go back to where they have it.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_00
 Let me bring up something about our basic goals here, what we want to accomplish.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_00
 Project announcements.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_04
 Not so much.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_00
 All right, we'll find that we're on our own.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_01
 Now, are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all?

0:16:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, let's do it.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_01
 Let's do it.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_01
 Same way, have any initial ideas.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to go ahead and take notes on this too, because.

0:16:39	None
 Good idea.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_03
 Start two minutes.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_00
 I'm saying initial ideas.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it's pretty much given it's going to be universal.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_03
 We decided that already.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_03
 And it may be functioning for other things.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_03
 As soon as you said that, it was going to be like all the other things you get in the most too, like your microwave or your front door, or like to have everything on one thing.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_03
 But then never going to fangirl those huge remotes that have like a million buttons you can't do.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_03
 Smaller is better.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_01
 Simple.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_01
 I'm thinking.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_01
 I'm thinking kind of pda design, so touchscreen design rather than button.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_01
 I hope so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that slick, isn't it?

0:17:23	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, like, stylus.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_00
 All right, so we got five minutes more to chat about.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_00
 That's perfect.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_00
 So we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between size and functionality.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_00
 And we also.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_03
 We want multi-functional, but at the same time, if you do too much, you're not going to be able to count them apart.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_02
 It's going to be too complicated.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_02
 It's a crowded button and some things.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_00
 I'm also going to note for future reference, this idea of...

0:17:55	SPEAKER_00
 I can remember I can help like a touchscreen type of remote.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_00
 Possibly.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think one of these is a good idea.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_02
 It needs one outstanding feature instead of apart from all the other units.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, all the other universal amounts.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if there's such thing out there.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_00
 I guess we'll do some research on it or one of us can do some research on it about whether or not there are multi-format, like, you know, PAL and PSC Region 1.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_01
 I'm pretty sure there is.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I have a friend who has a PDA.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_01
 That he just points at any television he wants.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_01
 I'll figure out the specifications of it and we'll control it.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_01
 Interesting.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_01
 I assume that that can be done with the around the world.

0:18:44	None
 Okay.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm liking that idea.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_00
 This idea of a touchscreen remote with multi-format features.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_02
 I think making out of a nice material would be very important because so many of those remotes that you see, these universal remotes, it's like so cheap and low quality.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, even nice and slick would be important.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_03
 And I don't know, like, there's such a problem with losing them.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_03
 That adding this whole like PDA pen business is only one more thing to lose.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_03
 So we're going to be careful of what, like, just something to, like, keep in mind that we start actually dealing with this stuff.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_03
 But I hope you really feel all.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
 Let's see.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_01
 I like the idea of the multi-plate.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_02
 What do they call those faceplate paint?

0:19:38	SPEAKER_02
 They're named face plates.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_02
 Are they?

0:19:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_01
 I like it.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_01
 We'll have to come up with a fuzzy one as well.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_04
 We'll call the winter day.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_02
 I think it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a, a locator device.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your mode.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_02
 Sure.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_02
 But if we're bundling it,

0:20:05	SPEAKER_00
 unless we're selling their tele with the remote. Right.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if we bundle it as a phone, then you can always call it.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_01
 If you are not doing that, then we can have something that just kind of rings from either, well, there used to be those whistling devices, but that's a little bit annoying.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_00
 Could we not do something where like just a little, like literally, just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you can place somewhere else that you press, and it makes the remote page kind of like how on a lot of cordless regular phones, you have a page button, it goes, can we do something like that?

0:20:46	SPEAKER_01
 That's cool.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_01
 I think so.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_01
 I think we could design that.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:51	None
 Good.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think this material quality as well, like I guess what we can think about what kind of, you know, Apple has been really successful with this surgical white kind of business of a sleek kind of.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_03
 Titanium, the new silver sleek ones with lots of players.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_03
 Very much so.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_03
 Curves.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we do have the minimum amount.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, we were talking finances that are now selling a 40-pound remote.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_00
 Our $40 remote, 25-year-old remote would be pretty expensive.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe we might want to trade off some of the features for a lower price without without getting into that whole like, you know, go down to bargain store remote, you know, bargains for universal remote that's black and, you know, massive.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_00
 Some kind of, I don't know, a balance there in somewhere.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_00
 Definitely.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_00
 But have a think about what we can do, have a think about what we want to do, how we're going to sell it.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_03
 And if we are users of mine, like these, grandlays are not going to be into this whole new, let's design the notes that used to the buttons.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_03
 So I'll have to be careful of exactly what marketing is to, and who we're going to be able to get it out of.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_02
 That's true.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_01
 We're talking 25 pounds or 25 years.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_01
 So we're going to have your own.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_01
 It's late, I don't know, yes?

0:22:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_00
 They're all weaker than, they're all stronger than the dollar.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_00
 Although, computer parts, if you're going to upgrade your computer by it in the States, like, do you guys know fries, huge computer electronics store, these serve, or they say yes, they will sell things overseas.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_00
 So you can buy stuff in America and have it shipped over for like 23 pounds or that.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_00
 Right, so let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to put these initial ideas that we've got in the project documents.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_00
 So if you guys need a reminder about what we've talked about on the different, you know, kind of trade-offs that we've got in the other ideas, you can consult them at your leisure.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_00
 Right, so thanks for that.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_00
 Let's just head back to work on what we were talking about before.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_00
 Go ahead, get going, too.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_03
 You have an hour?

0:23:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, perfect.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_00
 Thanks, guys.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_00
 Cool.

0:23:18	None
 Thank you.
