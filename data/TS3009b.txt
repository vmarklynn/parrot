0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 You know minutes.

0:00:16	None
 Your screen was also...

0:00:23	None
 I have great.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, I forgot my pen.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, I don't need it.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_05
 My screen is small again.

0:00:53	None
 I don't know what to do.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_02
 My screen is big.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_02
 Who starts?

0:01:05	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I'll start just with another presentation.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_02
 So then we can look at the agenda for this meeting.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_02
 I'll put some new things in the map.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_02
 This is it.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know the shortcut.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_02
 Well, our functional design meeting, the states were in.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_02
 Also, all three of you have prepared something about it.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_02
 We'll just have a look at the notes from the previous meeting.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_02
 What we thought we had decided.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_02
 Then we'll look at the three presentations from you.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_02
 I think you've prepared for all of that.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_02
 We'll look at the new project requirements.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_02
 You also have received the new project requirements from our bosses.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_02
 I've received them with some additional requirements.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should show them before your presentations because it's not really smart to include some things we can because of the new requirements.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_02
 Then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_02
 We have to decide in this meeting what our function will be.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_02
 Then we can discuss some more closing.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_01
 We have 40 minutes for this discussion.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think so.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_02
 Well, Vaka, the closing.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_02
 We'll not look at that yet.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_02
 I'll show that to this board.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_02
 Well, notes for this meeting.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_02
 I gave a presentation.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_02
 We familiarized ourselves with the boards.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_02
 Then we discussed some first ideas.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_02
 We have to merge the strong points from our competitors and look at their remote controls.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_02
 We should make it compatible with our new DVD and other releases we have, our technical releases.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_02
 Not too many buttons.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_02
 We'll recognize a move button in the middle.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_02
 Why do you do the most important functions with?

0:03:46	SPEAKER_02
 They can have two functions because you have a DVD and a television.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_02
 The design has to fit the hands, the original, but also be familiar.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_02
 It's one of our ideas.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_02
 It's just 30 minutes ago, so it's not quite a...

0:04:04	SPEAKER_02
 Now it's right.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_02
 But I have to do it.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_02
 The materials should be hard plastic with rubber from the ties and the labeling of the buttons should be indestructible.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_02
 It should be very nice.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_02
 Well, fronts for the remote, just like one more telephone.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_02
 And the technical aspect and also the labeling of the buttons, the functions should be universal standards.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_02
 That's just some ideas from the first meeting.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_02
 It's quite logical.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_02
 All of it.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_02
 Now the new project requirements, I'll just show them.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_02
 I got this mill from our bosses.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_02
 Well, data text goes out.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_02
 We will not use data text.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe I just ignored a thing.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_02
 But not data text.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's not my place to disagree against.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_02
 The second is a bit...

0:04:58	SPEAKER_02
 Shh, pity.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_02
 Because we just said we wanted to include DVD and data wanted because of our time we have for this project.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_02
 So that's a shame because especially for the third requirement, we want to reach people under the 30 years because we don't have those customers a lot at this point.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it's a bit pity because those people want to have one remote control for all those technical devices they can...

0:05:28	SPEAKER_02
 We forget about it.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_05
 It's just time consuming.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_02
 Well, and our corporate image should stay recognizable in our products.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_02
 So we have to use maybe a slogan, maybe a color, and on our remote controls, the design has to be...

0:05:47	SPEAKER_02
 As we already said, I'm actually familiar.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_02
 Not only this shape, but also our company.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we are a real fashion more company.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_01
 I read it all the...

0:06:03	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't know what company we were, but we designed it.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_01
 Especially trendy stuff.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_01
 So it has to be a modern design. It's important to know when you design it.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, I noted our slogan that we have, our company, that's... we put the fashion in electronics.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe that's a slogan that we can put somewhere on a remote control or something.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_02
 Alright, then we're going to have three presentations.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_02
 You want the start?

0:06:34	SPEAKER_02
 I think I have to start.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't see anything about that.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_05
 I just have to think which follows mine, because I was a bit in a hurry.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, well...

0:06:47	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's this one, but I'm not sure.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_05
 Gwynne?

0:06:59	SPEAKER_02
 Hi, if you want to open to PowerPoint.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_05
 Yes, this one.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_05
 To start with these points.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_05
 Next sheet.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_05
 At first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current controls, because it's a smart thing to exclude those things.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_05
 Furthermore, it's very important what they do like and what they do use.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_05
 Then I tell something about the most important issues.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_05
 So we have to focus on those three things.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_05
 And in the end I'll show you our target audience or our target product users, customers.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_05
 Well, the first findings are that people think most controls are very kind of ugly.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_05
 So that's 75% of the current users.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_05
 They don't like it, so we might think about fronts in that section.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_05
 They also say that's about, I thought it was 50%, that more money will be spent on better looking controls.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_05
 So it's very important that you design a nice looking control.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_05
 The current user uses his machine just about, well, all the time for a few functions.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_05
 Almost every user uses the control for just 10% of his capacity.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_05
 So it's really important to make the buttons for the common tasks kind of big or kind of flashy.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_05
 Furthermore, it's 75% of the users' Zepsilop.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_05
 This might be smart to make a big zapping button or something in the middle.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_05
 So you can reach the system.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_05
 You can zap away.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, right.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_05
 A lot of users' users lose their controls in the living room.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_05
 So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television that your control beeps or something that you can find very easily.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know, maybe that's an idea.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_05
 Because it's a big, I think, 50% of the users' loses its control within the same room.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_02
 It's actually loose from the television because it can also be used for other televisions.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_02
 So if you deliver a small click on device that you can put on your television that leaps to your remote control, everyone can use it.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but if you lose your click on the device.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_02
 No, you can click it on your television.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but if somebody else uses it in another room or something.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_05
 In another room.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_05
 The control is lost in the same room.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_05
 So, well, it'll be revised.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_05
 Furthermore, the learning time is a problem.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_05
 34% thinks it's too difficult to learn.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_05
 So the learning curve should be very short for the dumps people should be able to use it.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_01
 I think our user expert should also consider manual for the remote, of course.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but people don't read manuals.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_01
 No, they don't read it.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_01
 They use it to add one, do you think?

0:10:44	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_05
 I think you should put more time in the design of pick up and use.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_04
 That's manual.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, right.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_04
 Big cost of the user.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_04
 I know how it's supposed to work.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_02
 You should always be a manual, but it can be very short ahead.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_04
 And it should be consistent with all the remote control, I think.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_01
 Now, maybe for the, if you don't recognize a button, who do they call?

0:11:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, right.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_04
 It should be there, the manual, but not to explain how the remote works.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_05
 We don't have much time, so it's better to put our attention to the design so you can pick up and use it.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_02
 We are a design team.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_02
 We can say to some writer, make a manual.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_01
 It's not part of the, no.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_01
 Well, have a look.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_05
 Next point.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_05
 Yes?

0:11:33	SPEAKER_05
 Well, that's about 20% I thought, but the designer should take the, should consider there.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, consider the consequences of using your remote.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_05
 It should be a good in your hand.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_05
 This is the most important part.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_05
 We're, like the requirements that we're going to specify, we're going to target a younger audience.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_05
 That's about 60% of the market, so it's quite important.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_05
 Research shows that they like to have a little LCD screen on their, on their zapping device.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_05
 I thought it was the age between 16 and 20, 99% of the people like that.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_05
 So it's very important.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_05
 We should definitely have that in our designs.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_02
 Well, with 12 euro 50 as production cost we can afford to be in LZB.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but they think it's really important.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_05
 So if we want to, if we have a big, if we make lots of, of the stuff, maybe we can buy it very cheap.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_05
 We have to.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we'll consider it here.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_02
 Sure, your chance to look into the costs of those.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_05
 I don't have any information on it.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_03
 I know.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_03
 We'll look into that later.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_05
 And another thing is speech recognition.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_05
 They also like that, but research is very costly.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_04
 So that's difficult to realize also.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_05
 But it might be important.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_02
 We have very demanding clients.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_02
 It's not yet standard development.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_04
 We have customers in the world.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_05
 LCD is more, I think, reachable than speech recognition.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, absolutely.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_05
 So we might consider LCD screens.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_01
 I will consider both and see what we can find.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_01
 We don't rule them out immediately.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_05
 I think that's it.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_05
 I think it is sensible to take these points in the future.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_05
 So you can write.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I can still see your presentation.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_02
 Well, next, I don't know who is next.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_02
 You got a.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_02
 Can I give a technical talk?

0:14:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_01
 Go ahead.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it's my tech to explain what to point out of working design.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_01
 We have that here.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_01
 How do you enlarge it?

0:14:21	SPEAKER_01
 So that you have the F5.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_03
 F5.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, the one in the same?

0:14:28	SPEAKER_01
 That's my next button.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_01
 Well, right.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_01
 You know who I am and what I do.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_01
 So we have this.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_01
 It's a bit unclear because I want to copy paste something.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_01
 It was originally in black and white, but it became black and purple.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_01
 But I think you can read it.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think it's important for you to realize the basic function of a remote control.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you can see maybe you can select it.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, yes.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_05
 In first.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_01
 And I don't can select.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_01
 I can select on the.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_01
 Go to the next page.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, not for my.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you can read it.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_01
 It's not.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_01
 It's a schematic view of how a basic remote control works.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_01
 You have basically the energy, the power of the remote control and the center, which is the lead, the bulb that sends the infrared beam to the set.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_01
 And the source is, of course, the user.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_01
 And the user interface is the buttons, of course.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_01
 And the user interface sends the different signals of the different buttons to the chip.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_01
 The chip sends it to the left and the left sends it to the receiver.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_01
 That's the basic idea.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_01
 Very basic.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I have put it in a couple of basic steps.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_01
 The remote is basically just waiting for a user to press a key, does nothing until, of course, the key is pressed.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_01
 The key press is the signal to a chip.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_01
 The chip sends it to connection and recognize the key.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_01
 So, well, you understand.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_01
 The chip produces Morse code, a specific code to indicate that specific button, that is pressed, of course, and it uses transistors in the remote control to amplify and to send that signal again to the lead, which is the bulb, of course.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_01
 And the lead produces an infrared beam, signals the, well, it's very simple, and signals the, signals to the center on the TV set and the TV set also recognize the signal and performs the assigned task.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_02
 So, this is also why we have to have a button that says, I'm now busy with a DVD if we've had done that.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_01
 But we don't.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, exactly.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_01
 Well, this is the basic function of a remote.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_01
 I've done a couple of pictures here.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_01
 It's a very basic one.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_01
 And the score is if we're going to add an LCD screen to it, it won't look anything like this, but this is very basic, basically the shape of a remote control that has very little buttons.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_01
 But it's quite, you can easily recognize the buttons.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_01
 They're far enough apart and anything.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_01
 It's not very, not very high tech indeed, and not very user friendly.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_01
 If you look at shape, it's just a simple long box shape.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_01
 So we have to change a little bit to that.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_01
 So that comes more user friendly and that problems like Air Z and those kinds of things don't occur.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_05
 I have a table here about the relevance of the buttons.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_05
 The power button is used very much.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_05
 Channel selection, volume, and tail attacks.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_05
 Well, tail attacks is not an option.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_05
 But I think it's very important to make the power channel and volume buttons near to the thumb so you can't have Air Z consequences.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, because they are the most important buttons and you can immediately make them easy to

0:18:14	SPEAKER_05
 press.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_03
 You don't have to look and search for them.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_02
 If you have the most used buttons all in one place and you keep making the same moves. Well, if you would put it at a different place then you have to move your hands and that's

0:18:30	SPEAKER_05
 one of the things about Air Z. That's right.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_01
 You can't have any, every button under the thumb.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_02
 No, but the most important buttons, maybe you can just put them a bit apart.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_02
 So you would reject Air Z.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe you can make for channel changing two little buttons on the side of the remote so you can just do it like this.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_02
 I saw that on mobile telephones they also have those things that are usable.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_05
 Do people, when they pick up remote, know that they have to do that.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_05
 It's a new feature.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_05
 You can make a double feature like a button on the top.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 Also, if someone picks up the remote, I think it's a good thing.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_02
 If someone picks up his remote and he touches the side and he's already on the next channel.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_00
 That's very irritating.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_02
 I think.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_01
 In any case, the basic function should be, indeed, as you say, at the thumb, I think that's a good idea.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_01
 The less important buttons, like the different channels, the numbers, 1, 3, 4, 5, should be not in reach because they don't use it all the time.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it's pretty, basically, as you said, some pictures of the inside workings, but I don't want to get too technical because that's not very useful for your part of the job.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_01
 So, yeah, you said, this is how it looks from the inside.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_01
 I still like this.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_01
 I had to delete this button.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_03
 I had to make a schematic of the...

0:20:14	SPEAKER_02
 I had to do a little time, but don't look at this, please.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's clear.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_02
 It's the most important thing.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_02
 Probably the latest that we started this presentation.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_05
 I think about 20 minutes ago.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_02
 Then we have still the time.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_02
 But we do have to come to a decision.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, right.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:20:42	SPEAKER_04
 That's cool, ever.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_04
 I thought everybody on the website would see the same thing, but that's not the case.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, there are different...

0:20:56	SPEAKER_01
 We have all different home pages.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_04
 Different links, yeah.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_04
 For instance, you couldn't see this.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, well...

0:21:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I'm my younger.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_04
 Usually, in faces, I have the method.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I use my own experience with remote to look at the remote on the corporate website, which are these two.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_04
 These are already used.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, these are from another manufacturer.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_04
 This one is engineering-centered, so this one has the most functions and things.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_04
 This one is user-centered.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I like users-centered.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_04
 Also the best.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_04
 We also have...

0:21:46	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I thought that we would use the option to control the DVD also and tailor text and that kind of stuff.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_04
 So I thought we would use more or need more buttons than this one, but we have to reject that because it requires...

0:22:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_04
 That's why this is not relevant anymore.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_04
 I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we'll need.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, right.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_04
 I kind of like the shape.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_04
 I think this is what we talked about.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think you can't really see it from different sides, but I think...

0:22:29	SPEAKER_04
 No, I'll show this.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_04
 You can draw it a few...

0:22:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think we should go further with the idea of removable fronts.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_04
 So we can customize...

0:22:41	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, absolutely.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_02
 But they all have to have something about the recognition from our company.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_02
 So we cannot just make someone want...

0:22:50	SPEAKER_04
 If it's not the whole remote that changes.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_02
 No, but the side they look at is the front.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_02
 So if you make a front with just a tiger on it, then our recognition is totally gone.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's right.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_04
 You can put the same symbol on every remote.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_03
 That's the most...

0:23:10	SPEAKER_03
 Like everything...

0:23:11	SPEAKER_03
 We can put it on the backside.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_04
 Well, and...

0:23:14	SPEAKER_04
 Something like this...

0:23:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_04
 It's recognizable.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_05
 We can make a symbol of the company right here and a few with the front on it.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_05
 There's a hole in the front.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so don't replace the symbol.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_02
 Or the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_02
 That's not focused on the front.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_04
 Well, so like I said, I thought we'd use more functions.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_04
 We had to include more functions, but we don't.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_04
 So...

0:23:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_04
 I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe some less.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_04
 Like eject we don't need.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_04
 Some other buttons we don't need.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_01
 Mike, can you put that picture for me in the work document file?

0:23:57	SPEAKER_04
 I will.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_04
 I think for the remote less is more.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_04
 Less buttons, the better the design.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_04
 We should go with that concept, I think.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_05
 All right.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_05
 I've got another point.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_05
 There are two target audiences.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_05
 And we've chose for the younger one.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_05
 Research has shown that it's high-interested in features.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_05
 They are high-interested in feature.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_05
 But they are more critical for, yeah, critical.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_05
 The younger audience.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_05
 So we must design and control.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_05
 That really speaks to people.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_02
 Well, what if we at home have a remote that has the most familiar buttons on the top?

0:24:48	SPEAKER_02
 And the bottom side of the front has a little clap.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_02
 You can click away.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_02
 And then you have much more functions that most people don't use, but some don't do.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_01
 But I think the most functions underneath that aren't as much.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_02
 They are, especially if their features are important.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_02
 They want a lot.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_04
 But not.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_04
 What kind of features?

0:25:15	SPEAKER_04
 I think most of these screens have a false recognition.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_04
 But most look at the numbers.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_05
 The newest features are, like I said, our LCD and speech control.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_05
 Our audience, these people, are very like these features.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_05
 You see?

0:25:33	SPEAKER_05
 So we must build in something, or they will go to the concurrent.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_05
 Our competitors.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_05
 Our competitors, right.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_05
 So I do think we have to have some features.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_02
 Even though they cost a little more.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_02
 From some calculators, you have those little LCD that you can click on or something.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_02
 You can click out of the remote.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_02
 And if that gives you a little bit of set of information.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_05
 Which program you are watching or something.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_02
 Those kind of things.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_02
 Because you also have those program recognition for your PCRs.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_02
 And if your remote picks that up also, they can display which program you are currently watching.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_01
 So it just signals the different symbols on the screen.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_01
 Because if you change to channel 2, you have 2 on the screen and 2 on your...

0:26:33	SPEAKER_01
 For example.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_01
 On your LCD screen.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_02
 It could be such a little that you can click in and out and you have it.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we should keep that simple too.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_01
 But should it really be clickable?

0:26:45	SPEAKER_01
 No, maybe.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's really integrated.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_01
 Just integrate in the right to make it more trendy.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_04
 You said like this, you can watch something like on some radios in the car.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_04
 You're walking...

0:26:59	SPEAKER_05
 Are the answers to something?

0:27:02	SPEAKER_01
 That's of course a bit more expensive than the basic calculator design.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_01
 But there's a scrolling text and that kind of thing.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's just a script that keeps it rolling.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_02
 It's five minutes of implementing time.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_02
 Five minutes, yeah.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, for programming.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_05
 So I don't think that's the issue.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_05
 Alright.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_05
 Alright.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_02
 We go with LCD.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I think so, yes.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_04
 We still need to know how much that will cost.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know if I can find that.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_04
 No, maybe you'll get that information.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_02
 We can use this board again, I think.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_02
 We can put some decisions about the controls we want, the issue with it.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_02
 Where's my presentation?

0:27:51	SPEAKER_05
 I understand which.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_05
 We should have a general idea of how it's going to look.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we are here now, I think.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_02
 These I've already given you, so we have to decide on the different remote control functions.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_02
 So we want to have a small LCD screen.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_02
 That's special.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_01
 Shouldn't we start with the most important part?

0:28:22	SPEAKER_01
 LCD screen.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_01
 Alright, we should start with the power button.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_05
 How do you zap?

0:28:29	SPEAKER_05
 You just sit in your chair.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_00
 Huh?

0:28:32	SPEAKER_04
 With the LCD screen on top, it gets a bit terrible.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_04
 It's terrible.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_04
 Because most remote have some space left at the bottom.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but that's where your hand form might be.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_01
 And then...

0:28:47	SPEAKER_05
 We'll try to...

0:28:49	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we should centralize the discussion here.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know what you're talking about.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_05
 We're basically with something.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, right.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_05
 He thinks it's better to put LCD at the bottom.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_01
 Why do you think it's better at the bottom?

0:29:03	SPEAKER_04
 Well, because most remotes have some space left at the bottom.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_04
 That way you can keep the shape recognizable.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_04
 Sure.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_01
 But you just can put the whole interface a bit down to the test.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_01
 Really?

0:29:18	SPEAKER_05
 I think that the LCD is like small.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_05
 It's white.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_05
 It's not high.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I think Mike has a point.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_02
 When I use a remote, I hate the buttons at the bottom.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_02
 Bottom.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_02
 Bottom.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_02
 And I like to use them once.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_00
 On the top.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_02
 When I have to...

0:29:38	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I agree with you.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_02
 It's also more recognizable.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_01
 It looks more like a calculator to people.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_01
 If you have the...

0:29:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, but we don't want that.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_01
 So, I think that's a good thing.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's a good thing.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_01
 You have the...

0:29:56	SPEAKER_02
 We don't want that.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_02
 We don't want them to look like a calculator.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_02
 It must be a remote.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_02
 Like our original.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you don't have to throw an important aspect, like familiarity completely away.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's a bit lighter.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's still important to have it at the top.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_05
 It's more familiar that way.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_05
 When I draw here, it's a bit off.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_02
 A little bit.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_02
 It needs to be calibrated.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_02
 Let's talk about that later.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you should not append.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe that's better.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_01
 It's special now.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_05
 We have to make a decision now.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_05
 We don't have much time.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_05
 I think we have a few functions.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_05
 We can put the LCD above it.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_05
 We still have lots of room at the bottom.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_02
 I think it should be at the bottom.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_02
 I'm the designer.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_05
 I just agree.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_05
 We're too fierce too.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_02
 What if we first decide the different functions

0:31:04	SPEAKER_03
 and then look at the design?

0:31:06	SPEAKER_01
 We were busy with that. We should summon the different aspects of the thing.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_01
 We have the power button.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_05
 I think that you two should come to consensus about the LCD.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_05
 It's your job.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, of course.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_03
 We have a power button, guys.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_01
 Are you have to agree?

0:31:24	SPEAKER_01
 I can say it's like this.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_01
 I agree.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_01
 We have a power button,

0:31:27	SPEAKER_02
 a setting button, LCD window, the number buttons.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. Yeah.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_01
 Volume.

0:31:33	None
 Volume control.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:31:35	None
 Let's look at the data.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_01
 Let's look at your design.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_02
 The mute button.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_02
 I love that one.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_04
 I think we should use something like this.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_04
 To the general up and general down button.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_04
 Well, that's the exposure design.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_04
 The design's role also.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_01
 On this remote, these controls are for something else.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, they are for some video drops on these buttons.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_05
 You should put that power button channel and volume should have the most importance.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_04
 I think this should be in one big circle in the middle.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but what he said about RZ was kind of true.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_05
 When you put them all in the same place, the most used buttons, you're doing the same thing all the time.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_05
 That's just what RZ is all about.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_05
 So it might be smarter to put them a little more apart away from each other.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_02
 So people have to move their hand and they get less complaints of RZ.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly when one ends.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_01
 That's what I always do because all my important buttons are in the same place.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_01
 Good to move from time to time.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_04
 People don't like it when their buttons are all over the place.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, it would be sent.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_01
 We have to choose a frequency for button use.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_05
 Channels are most used within the hour.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_05
 You can see the channel buttons should be far apart.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_05
 I think.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_05
 Open down.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_05
 I've been down far apart from each other.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_05
 You're thinking about RZ.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_05
 Well, not too much.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_00
 Look at that.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_04
 Not too much, but the other two frustrations are far more important.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_01
 I think you can have the two buttons up and down close together, but you don't have to have volume control.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_02
 Well, for example, the power button.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_04
 You can, well, they're used for time to go away.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_02
 If someone is constantly zapping, it's not going to miss that the power button is not right beside because someone...

0:34:06	SPEAKER_02
 I don't need to be...

0:34:07	SPEAKER_02
 So that one can be put away.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, right.

0:34:10	None
 Yeah.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_02
 The power button can be...

0:34:14	SPEAKER_04
 Power button should be left at the top.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, man, five minutes.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_05
 Well, five minutes left.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_05
 Just make some decisions.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_05
 Yep.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_05
 The most important things we have to...

0:34:28	SPEAKER_02
 How are we going to do it with the game makers?

0:34:30	SPEAKER_01
 We can use the drawing board now.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_01
 I think it doesn't work well, but...

0:34:34	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think it's pretty nice if we could just draw a simple...

0:34:38	SPEAKER_01
 I do think we have to take two seconds.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_01
 You have to take two seconds.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_05
 You have to take two seconds.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_05
 You decide that, you decide that.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_05
 All right.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_02
 Well, the LCD...

0:34:49	SPEAKER_02
 You are industrial.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_02
 You are user interface.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_02
 So I think it's going to go to Mike.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_02
 But you will have to make consensus with...

0:34:59	SPEAKER_02
 Well...

0:35:00	SPEAKER_04
 Well, consensus.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it's a bit hard because we're going to be individually.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_02
 That's a bit...

0:35:05	SPEAKER_02
 We're deciding now.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_05
 Top of the bottom.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_01
 Well, yeah, I still think it's quite important.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, it is.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_01
 We have it at top, so...

0:35:16	SPEAKER_03
 You say familiarity is important, but...

0:35:18	SPEAKER_02
 Well, what if we're going to now decide about the functions and the design comes into the next round?

0:35:23	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_02
 But the design round is still to come, eh?

0:35:27	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_02
 These functions...

0:35:31	SPEAKER_02
 We agree we do have LCD, so...

0:35:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_02
 That's all right.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_02
 That's...

0:35:36	SPEAKER_02
 The number function.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_02
 That's enough.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_02
 Are we going to do it like on Mike's screen with one button that says I'm going to do two numbers.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_02
 Two number of digital?

0:35:44	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_02
 How do you want it to do then?

0:35:47	SPEAKER_02
 There's one to three, four, five, six.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_02
 It has to recognize one as...

0:35:51	SPEAKER_02
 There can still come more.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_04
 No, if you...

0:35:54	SPEAKER_04
 Almost...

0:35:55	SPEAKER_04
 If you press two numbers shortly after each other.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_03
 It recognizes it.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_03
 So no button for that.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_02
 That's very easy.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_02
 Anyone, any other functionalities of our...

0:36:09	SPEAKER_01
 Remote, I think these are the most important things you'll have to picture over there.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:15	None
 Show.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, that's right.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_05
 You do need the...

0:36:27	SPEAKER_05
 Milk or...

0:36:28	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_05
 Like this one.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_05
 You doing it?

0:36:31	SPEAKER_05
 No, we didn't.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_02
 No, we didn't.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_05
 No, we didn't.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_05
 Are we?

0:36:35	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_02
 No, OK.

0:36:39	SPEAKER_02
 Well, because we can integrate it with any other...

0:36:42	SPEAKER_02
 Remotes all those buttons on those pictures are irrelevant.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_02
 So just for a television, is that all we need?

0:36:50	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it's most useful this way.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_01
 It is heavy-breathing function.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_02
 The A-text is gone.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_02
 So all those buttons that are to do with A-text...

0:37:00	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, screen placing.

0:37:02	SPEAKER_02
 You have those buttons about...

0:37:06	SPEAKER_02
 And there's two important buttons we're forgetting.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_02
 There's a screen.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_02
 You can make it wider and less wide.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_02
 And the button that you can go to for your video.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_05
 I do think we have to put that underneath the clip.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_03
 Those two, but it's just two.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_03
 And we make a...

0:37:23	SPEAKER_01
 Just two under a...

0:37:24	SPEAKER_01
 That's a bit...

0:37:25	SPEAKER_04
 We can make a little row of like four buttons down here.

0:37:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_03
 Or...

0:37:31	SPEAKER_02
 At the top.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_02
 Your LCD scan is going to go.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_01
 You can put two or three buttons under another section.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_01
 That's too complicated.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_01
 You can just put it somewhere.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_01
 They aren't used much.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_01
 Not as much as those other.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_01
 You can put it somewhere...

0:37:44	SPEAKER_01
 They can be smaller around.

0:37:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, a bit smaller.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_01
 And I think more at the bottom.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_01
 Or at the top.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_01
 What do you think?

0:37:55	SPEAKER_01
 Those buttons.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_01
 About four.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_01
 I think they should.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_02
 In an isolated part of the remote.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_01
 And where?

0:38:03	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we have it.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_01
 And we design later where everything goes.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_02
 Well, any other...

0:38:09	SPEAKER_05
 Well, if you...

0:38:11	SPEAKER_02
 Why don't you video?

0:38:12	SPEAKER_02
 If you...

0:38:13	SPEAKER_02
 Go to video.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_02
 That's always on your remote control.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but you have the...

0:38:16	SPEAKER_02
 You have the...

0:38:17	SPEAKER_02
 The video channel.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_05
 The 80.

0:38:19	SPEAKER_00
 That's just zero.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_00
 Zero.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_04
 No, not always.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_01
 Not a...

0:38:23	SPEAKER_01
 Not a...

0:38:24	SPEAKER_01
 Zero is a different channel than the video channel.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but you can...

0:38:27	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but when you step down zero, you get to AFI.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_05
 Yes, I think that...

0:38:30	SPEAKER_02
 I don't.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_02
 I go to 99.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_02
 Then you press 99.

0:38:33	SPEAKER_04
 But I think go to video with...

0:38:35	SPEAKER_04
 That's the button.

0:38:37	SPEAKER_01
 But it's easy to go...

0:38:39	SPEAKER_01
 If you are at a channel 55 and you want to go immediately to the video channel, you have to push A to...

0:38:47	SPEAKER_01
 Now you can go to zero.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_01
 Zero.

0:38:49	SPEAKER_01
 More easy to get to...

0:38:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_02
 But the specific...

0:38:52	SPEAKER_02
 A video channel.

0:38:53	SPEAKER_02
 I use it.

0:38:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but if we're choosing to incorporate these buttons, you have to have a channel setting.

0:39:00	SPEAKER_05
 If you have a new TV, you have to set the channels.

0:39:03	SPEAKER_05
 All these different buttons.

0:39:05	SPEAKER_02
 Even though I don't have buttons for channels, especially on my remote.

0:39:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, well, it's different.

0:39:10	SPEAKER_02
 More great settings.

0:39:11	SPEAKER_02
 Plus and down.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_02
 Now you...

0:39:14	SPEAKER_04
 You have one button from...

0:39:16	SPEAKER_04
 Set frequency or something.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_04
 And with plus and minus, you can adjust the...

0:39:22	SPEAKER_05
 That's the only one we put in there.

0:39:25	SPEAKER_02
 So we should have one for...

0:39:28	SPEAKER_02
 For screen...

0:39:29	SPEAKER_05
 Channel setting.

0:39:31	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, to...

0:39:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, of course, to configure the...

0:39:35	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, okay button.

0:39:37	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, you're always in the center, an okay button.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_02
 For your menu.

0:39:43	SPEAKER_02
 Menu button.

0:39:44	SPEAKER_02
 You should...

0:39:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:39:46	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's important.

0:39:47	SPEAKER_01
 Channel setting...

0:39:48	SPEAKER_01
 Blue.

0:39:49	SPEAKER_01
 And settings to change the brightness.

0:39:50	SPEAKER_01
 The settings to change the brightness and the contrast.

0:39:53	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:39:54	SPEAKER_01
 Channel.

0:39:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:56	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:39:57	SPEAKER_02
 G.

0:39:58	SPEAKER_03
 Safe.

0:39:59	None
 G.

0:40:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, say.

0:40:01	SPEAKER_01
 The menu button is also important.

0:40:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I have to put it in.

0:40:05	SPEAKER_01
 Well...

0:40:06	SPEAKER_01
 I don't see it.

0:40:08	SPEAKER_01
 Here.

0:40:09	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, menu.

0:40:10	SPEAKER_04
 I think things like contrast and brightness should be...

0:40:13	SPEAKER_04
 In the menu.

0:40:14	SPEAKER_04
 In the menu, yeah.

0:40:15	SPEAKER_01
 And you can adjust it with the second buttons or something.

0:40:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the...

0:40:19	SPEAKER_01
 Because the second buttons are used then, if you are in the menu.

0:40:21	SPEAKER_02
 Guys, we're going to...

0:40:23	SPEAKER_02
 We're going to go to our rooms and we'll have to decide our things on our own, I think.

0:40:29	SPEAKER_02
 Great.

0:40:30	SPEAKER_02
 So, Chief.

0:40:31	None
 All right.

0:40:32	SPEAKER_05
 Well, see you.

0:40:33	SPEAKER_05
 We have lunch time, by the way.

0:40:36	SPEAKER_02
 Now...

0:40:37	SPEAKER_05
 I'm hungry.

0:40:38	SPEAKER_01
 Lunch.

0:40:39	SPEAKER_05
 Gotten to my belly.

0:40:41	SPEAKER_02
 We didn't exactly do everything, man.

0:40:45	SPEAKER_02
 And how many pows is sticking to?

0:40:47	SPEAKER_04
 See you later, right?

0:40:49	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:40:50	SPEAKER_02
 We don't have any clothes in there.

0:40:53	SPEAKER_02
 We have clothes in here.

0:40:55	SPEAKER_02
 Hey?

0:40:56	None
 Mm-hmm.

0:40:57	SPEAKER_02
 We have clothes in here.

0:40:59	SPEAKER_02
 We have a presentation in here.

0:41:00	None
 We have a presentation in here.
