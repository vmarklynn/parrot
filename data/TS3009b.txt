0:00:00	None
 Hey.

0:00:07	None
 Hey.

0:00:12	SPEAKER_02
 Hey.

0:00:15	SPEAKER_02
 Hey.

0:00:21	None
 Your screen was also wet.

0:00:28	None
 Okay.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:00:40	None
 Oh, I forgot my pen.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, I get the needle.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, no.

0:00:49	None
 My screen is small again.

0:00:51	None
 I don't know.

0:00:52	None
 I love to hear what to do.

0:00:54	None
 So, what I can read it like.

0:00:59	None
 Hey.

0:01:00	None
 My screen is big.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_02
 Great man.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_02
 Who starts?

0:01:04	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I'll start just with another presentation.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_02
 So, then we can look at the agenda for this meeting.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_02
 I put some new things in the map.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, boy.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_02
 This is it.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_02
 I know that shortcut.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_02
 Well, our functional design meeting, that's the states we're in.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_02
 And you're also all three of you have prepared something about it.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we'll just have a look at the notes from the previous meeting.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_02
 What we thought we had decided, but then we'll look at the three presentations from you.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_02
 I think you prepared for all of that.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_02
 We'll look at the new project requirements.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_02
 You also have received the meal.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_02
 The new project requirements from our bosses.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I've received a meal with some additional requirements.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_02
 And I'll have a look of, well, I think we should show them before your presentations, because it's not really a smart to include some things we can't because of the new requirements.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_02
 Well, then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_02
 We have to decide it in this meeting.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_02
 What our functions will be.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_02
 And then we can discuss some more closing.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_01
 We have 40 minutes for this.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think so.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_02
 Well, the closing, I will not look at that yet.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_02
 Now, look at the show that this board.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_02
 Well, a notes first meeting.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_02
 Now, I gave a presentation.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_02
 We've familiarized us with the boards.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_02
 And then we discussed some first ideas.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_02
 So we said that we have to merge the strong points from our competitors.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_02
 And look at their remote controls.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_02
 We should make it compatible with our new DVD and other releases we have, our technical releases.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_02
 Not too many buttons.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_02
 Well, recognizable button in the middle.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_02
 Where you do the most important functions with.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_02
 And well, they can have two functions because you have a DVD and a television.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_02
 The design has to fit the hands, the original, but also be familiar.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_02
 It's one of ideas.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_02
 It's just 30 minutes ago.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_02
 Now it's right.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_02
 But I have to do it.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_02
 The materials should be hard plastic with rubber from the ties.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_02
 And the labeling of the buttons should be indestructible.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_02
 It should be easily wiped out.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_02
 Well, fronts were the remote just like almost telephones.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_02
 And the technical aspect.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_02
 And also labeling of the buttons to functions should be universal standards.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that's just some ideas from the first meeting.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_02
 And the logical all of it.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_02
 Now, the new project requirements, I'll just show them.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_02
 I got this mill from our bosses.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_02
 Well, teletext goes out.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_02
 We will not use teletext.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe I need to sort of fit it.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_02
 But not teletext.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's not my place to disagree, I guess.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_02
 The second is a bit sh-pitty.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_02
 Because we just said we wanted to include DVD.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_02
 And they don't want it.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_02
 Because of our time, we have for this project.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, all right.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_02
 So that's a shame.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_02
 Because especially for the third requirement, we want to reach people under the 30 years.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_02
 Because we don't have those customers at this point.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it's a bit pitty.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_02
 Because those people want to have one remote control for all those technical devices they can-

0:05:29	SPEAKER_05
 Let's not forget about it. It's just time-consuming.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_02
 Well, and our corporate image shoots state-run recognizable in our products.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_02
 So we have to use maybe a slogan, maybe a color.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_02
 And, yeah, well, on our remote controls, the design has to be, well, as we're all already said, actually, familiar.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_02
 Not only does the shape, but also our company.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we are a real fashion-more company.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_01
 I read it already told that- I didn't know what company we were, but we designed a- Especially trendy stuff.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_01
 So it has to be a modern design.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_01
 It's important to know when you design things.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_02
 I noted our slogan that we have, our company, that's- We put the fashion in electronics.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_02
 No. So maybe that's a slogan we can put somewhere on our remote control or something.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_02
 All right, then we're going to have three presentations.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_02
 You want the start?

0:06:34	SPEAKER_02
 I think I have to start.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't see anything about it.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, no, it's the order now.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_05
 Well, then- I do stuff to think which follows mine, because I was a bit in hurry.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, well, where?

0:06:47	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's this one, but I'm not sure.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_05
 I'm going to start with these points.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_02
 I have to- You already opened the PowerPoint.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_05
 Yes, this is- Yeah.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I'm going to tell you something about the functional requirements.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_05
 To start with these points.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_05
 Next, you- At first, I tell you something about what people dislike about the current controls, because it's a smart thing to exclude those things.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_05
 Furthermore, it's very important what they do like and what they do use.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_05
 Then I tell something about the most important issues.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_05
 So we have to focus on those three things.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_05
 And in the end, I'll show you our target audience or our target product users, customers.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_05
 Well, the first findings are that people think most controls are very kind of ugly.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_05
 That's 75% of the current users.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_05
 They don't like it, so we might think about fronts in that section.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_05
 They also say that's about, I thought it was 50%, that more money will be spent on better looking controls.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_05
 So it's very important that you design a nice looking control.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_05
 The current user uses his machine just about, well, all the time for a few functions.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_05
 Almost every user uses the control for just 10% of his capacity.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_05
 So it's really important to make the buttons for the common tasks kind of big or kind of flashy.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_05
 Furthermore, it's 75% of the user's zeppes a lot.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_05
 It might be smart to make a big zapping button or something in the middle, so you can reach it with your thumb.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_05
 That's a good way.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_05
 A lot of users lose their controls in the living room.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_05
 So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television that your control beeps or something that you can find very easily.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know, maybe that's an idea.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_05
 The big, I think, 50% of the users lose his control.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_05
 It's in the same room.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_02
 It's actually loose from the television because it can also be used for other televisions.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_02
 So if you deliver a small click on device that you can put on your television that beeps to your remote control and you lose your click on the television.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but if someone else uses it in another room or something.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_05
 It's not a room.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_05
 The control is lost in the same room.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_05
 So, well, it would be five-seater.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_05
 Furthermore, the learning time is a problem.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_05
 34% thinks it's too difficult to learn.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_05
 So the learning curve should be very short for the dumb people should be able to use it.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_01
 I think our user expert should also consider manual for the remote.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but people don't read manuals.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_01
 Now, they don't read it?

0:10:41	SPEAKER_01
 So it is users to add one.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_01
 Do you think?

0:10:45	SPEAKER_05
 I think you should put more time in the design of pick-up and use.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_04
 It's a manual.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, right.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_04
 Because they don't use it.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_04
 And know how it's supposed to work.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_02
 You should always be a manual, but can be very careful.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_04
 Nobody reads all the remote control.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe if you don't recognize a button, who do they call?

0:11:09	SPEAKER_04
 It should be there, the manual, but not to explain how the remote works.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_05
 We don't have much time, so it's better to put our attention to the design so you can pick up and use it.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_02
 We are a design team. We can say to some writer, make a manual.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_02
 It's part of the...

0:11:28	SPEAKER_01
 No, no.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we'll have a look.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_05
 Next point.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_05
 Yes?

0:11:32	SPEAKER_05
 Ericie?

0:11:33	SPEAKER_05
 Well, that's about 20% I thought, but the designer should take it to...

0:11:42	SPEAKER_05
 Consider the consequences of using your remote.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_05
 It should be a good thing in your hand.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_05
 Right. This is the most important part.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_05
 We're...

0:11:59	SPEAKER_05
 Like the requirements said, we're going to specify...

0:12:02	SPEAKER_05
 We're going to target a younger audience.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_05
 That's about 60% of the market, so it's quite important.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_05
 Research shows that they like to have a little LCD screen on their...

0:12:15	SPEAKER_05
...Zapping device.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_05
 I thought it was the age between 16 and 20, 99% of the people like that.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_05
 So it's very important. We should definitely have that in our designs.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_02
 Well, with 12 Euro 50, as production cost, we can't afford to spend the...

0:12:37	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but they think it's really important.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_05
 So if we want to... If we make lots of stuff, maybe we can buy it very cheap.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know. We have to...

0:12:53	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we'll consider it here.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_02
 You're tossing to look into the costs of that...

0:12:58	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if any information on that...

0:13:00	SPEAKER_05
 Well, we'll look into that later.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_05
 And another thing is speed recognition.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_05
 They also like that, but research is very costly.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_04
 So that's difficult to realize also.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah. But it might be important for you to...

0:13:17	SPEAKER_02
 We have very demanding clients.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_02
 It's not yet a standard development, though, and we have customers...

0:13:22	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I do think LCD is more...

0:13:24	SPEAKER_05
...richable than a standard.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, absolutely.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_05
 So we might consider LCD screens.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah, all right.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_01
 We'll consider both and see what we can find, I think.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_01
 We don't rule them out immediately.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_05
 I think that's it.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_05
 I think it is sensible to take these points into the notes...

0:13:51	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_05
...so you can...

0:13:53	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I can still see your presentation.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, right.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_02
...since...

0:13:59	SPEAKER_02
 Well, next...

0:14:00	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know who is next.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_02
 You've got a...

0:14:03	SPEAKER_02
 Can I give you a technical talk?

0:14:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_02
 I'll give you a little bit of a technical talk.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I just might take to explain...

0:14:12	SPEAKER_01
...of the point out of working design.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_01
 We have that here.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, how do you large it so that you can have the...

0:14:22	SPEAKER_01
 F5.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_03
 F5.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the working design...

0:14:27	SPEAKER_01
 That's my...

0:14:29	SPEAKER_01
...like button.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_01
 Well, all right. You know what I am, and what I do.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_01
 We have this. It's a bit unclear because I wanted to copy paste something.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_01
 It was originally in black and white, but it became black and...

0:14:41	SPEAKER_01
...per-purple, but...

0:14:43	SPEAKER_01
 I think you can read it.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think it's important for you to realize the basic function of a remote control.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you can see...

0:14:53	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe you can select it.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, yes, really?

0:14:55	SPEAKER_05
 In first.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_01
 And I don't...

0:14:58	SPEAKER_01
 I can select on the...

0:14:59	SPEAKER_01
 The next picture.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, no, no, no.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you can read it. It's not the difficult.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_01
 This is a schematic view of how a basic remote control works.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_01
 You have the energy, the power of the...

0:15:16	SPEAKER_01
...mode control and the sender, which is the LED.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_01
 The bulb that sends the infrared beam to the...

0:15:26	SPEAKER_01
...now, to the sender.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_01
 And the source is, of course, the user.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_01
 The user interface is...

0:15:33	SPEAKER_01
...the buttons, of course.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_01
 And the user interface sends...

0:15:38	SPEAKER_01
...the different signals of the different buttons to the chip.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_01
 The chip sends it to the LED.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_01
 And the LED sends it to receive it.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_01
 That's the basic idea. Very basic.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I have...

0:15:54	SPEAKER_01
...put it in a couple of basic steps.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_01
 The remote is basically just waiting for a user to press a key.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_01
 It does nothing until, of course, the key is pressed.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_01
 The key press is the signal to a chip.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_01
 The chip sends it to the connection and recognizes the key.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_01
 So, well, you understand.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_01
 The chip produces more code, a specific code, to indicate that specific button, that is pressed, of course.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_01
 And it uses transistors in the remote control...

0:16:22	SPEAKER_01
...to amplify and to send that signal, again, to the LED, which is the bulb, of course.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_01
 And the LED produces an infrared beam, and signals the...

0:16:33	SPEAKER_01
...well, it's very simple.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_01
 And signals to the sensor on the TV set, and the TV set also recognizes the signal...

0:16:42	SPEAKER_01
...and performs the assigned task.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_02
 So, this is also why we have to have a button that says, I'm now busy with a DVD if we had done that.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_02
 And the button...

0:16:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but we don't have any.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, exactly.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_01
 Well, this is the basic function of a remote.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_01
 I have some couple of pictures here.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_01
 It's a very basic one.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_01
 And this corp is, if you're going to add an LCD screen to it, it won't look anything like this.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_01
 But this is very basic, basically, the shape of a remote control...

0:17:14	SPEAKER_01
...it has very little buttons.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_01
 But it's quite...

0:17:20	SPEAKER_01
 You can easily recognize the buttons.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_01
 They are far enough apart and anything.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_01
 It's not very high-tech indeed, and it's not very user-friendly, if you look at the shape.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_01
 It's just a simple long box shape.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_01
 So, we have to change a little bit to that.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_01
 So, that comes more user-friendly, and that problems like air-Z.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_01
 Don't talk to me.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_05
 I have a table here about the relevance of the buttons.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_05
 The power button is used very much.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_05
 Channel selection, volume, and tail-tech.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_05
 Well, tail-tech is not an option.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_05
 But I think it's very important to make the power channel and volume buttons near to the thumb, so you can't have air-Z consequences.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, because they are the most important buttons.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_05
 And you can immediately make them easy to press.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you don't have to look and search for them.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_02
 If you have the most used buttons all in one place, and you keep making the same...

0:18:23	SPEAKER_02
 Well, move right.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_02
 But if you would put it at a different place, then you have to move your hands.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_02
 And that's one of the things about RZ.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_05
 That's right.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_05
 You can't have any...

0:18:33	SPEAKER_01
 Every button under the thumb, of course.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_02
 The most important buttons, maybe you can just put them a bit apart, so you would...

0:18:41	SPEAKER_02
 That's very important.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_02
 And reject RZ.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe you can make for channel changing too little buttons on the side of the remote, so you can just do like this.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_02
 I saw that on mobile phones, they also have the other things.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_05
 They are the most usable.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_05
 Do people, when they pick up a remote, know that they have to do that?

0:19:03	SPEAKER_05
 It's a new feature.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_05
 You can make a double feature like a button on the top and...

0:19:09	SPEAKER_05
 Well, also, if someone puts a...

0:19:11	SPEAKER_02
 I'm down there, the remote...

0:19:13	SPEAKER_04
 It's missing.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_04
 I think it is sent with.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_02
 If someone puts up his remote and he touches the side, and he's over there on the next channel, that's very irritating.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_02
 I think...

0:19:25	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but...

0:19:26	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
 In any case, the basic function should be indeed, and as you say, at the thumb, I think that's a good idea.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_01
 And the less important buttons, like the different channels, the numbers, one to three, four, five, and so it should be...

0:19:39	SPEAKER_01
 Well, not in reach, because they don't use it all this time.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it's pretty, pretty...

0:19:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, basically, as you said, and as from pictures of the inside, working, but I don't want to get too technical, because that's not very useful for you or part of the job.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_01
 So, yeah, you know, this is how it looked from the inside.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_01
 And, well, that's about it, I think.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah, I still like this.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_01
 I had to delete this, but I had to make a schematic of...

0:20:08	SPEAKER_01
 I had to do a little time, but don't...

0:20:11	SPEAKER_01
 Don't look at this, please.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's clear.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_02
 We understand how it works.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_02
 That's the most important thing.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_02
 Nice.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_02
 Then, Mike can give the third presentation.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_02
 Right, latest, did we start this presentation?

0:20:28	SPEAKER_05
 I think about 20 minutes ago.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_00
 You do time, you do.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_02
 Then we have still the time.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_02
 But we do have to come to a decision.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, right.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:20:41	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:20:42	SPEAKER_02
 That's great, ever.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I thought everybody on the website would see the same thing, but...

0:20:51	SPEAKER_04
 Obviously, that's not the case.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, there are different...

0:20:56	SPEAKER_01
 We all have different home pages.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_04
 Different links, yeah.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_04
 For instance, you couldn't see this.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, yeah, well...

0:21:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I am my younger, usually in phases, aren't it?

0:21:11	SPEAKER_04
 The method, well...

0:21:14	SPEAKER_04
 I use my own experience with remotes to the good look...

0:21:18	SPEAKER_04
 The remotes on the corporate website, which are these two.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_04
 These are already used.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, these are from another manufacturer.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_04
 This one is engineering centered, so this one has the most functions on things.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_04
 This one is user centered.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I like user centered.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_04
 I like user centered centered.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_04
 Also the best.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_04
 We also.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I thought that we used the option to control the DVD also, and tailor text and that kind of stuff.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_04
 So I thought we would use more or need more buttons than this one.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_04
 But we have to re-check that because it's required.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_04
 That's why this is not relevant anymore.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_04
 I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we'll need.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, right.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_04
 I kind of like the shape.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_04
 I think this is what we talked about.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think you can't really see it from different sides, but I think...

0:22:28	SPEAKER_01
 No, I...

0:22:29	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, I see.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_04
 You can draw it a few...

0:22:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_04
 I think we should go further with the idea of removable fronts.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_04
 So you can...

0:22:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, customize the...

0:22:41	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, excuse me, but they all have to have something about the recognition from our company.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_02
 So we cannot just...

0:22:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, make someone...

0:22:51	SPEAKER_04
 No, that's not the whole remote that changes.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_04
 No, but...

0:22:54	SPEAKER_02
 The side they look at is the front.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_02
 So if you make a front with just a tie you're on it, then our recognition is totally gone.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's right.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_04
 Now you can put same symbol on every remote.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_03
 That's the most...

0:23:10	SPEAKER_03
 Like everything that comes to the back side.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_04
 Well, and...

0:23:14	SPEAKER_04
 Something like this.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_04
 It's recognizable.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_05
 We can make a symbol of the company right here and a few with the front on it, there's a hole in the front.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so that...

0:23:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, don't replace the symbol, yeah.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_02
 Or the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_02
 But there's no focus on the front.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_04
 Well, so like I said, I thought we'd use more functions.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_04
 We had to include more functions, but we don't.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_04
 I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need, maybe some less.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_04
 Like eject, we don't need some other buttons we don't need.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_01
 Mike, can you put that picture for me in the work document file?

0:23:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I will.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_04
 I think for the remote, less is more.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_04
 Less buttons, the better the design.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_04
 We should grow with that concept, I think.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_05
 I've got another point.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_05
 There are two target audience, and we've chose for the younger one.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_05
 Research has shown that it's a high interested in features.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_05
 They are high interested in features, but they are more critical.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_05
 For a critical.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_05
 The younger audience.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_05
 So we must design a control that really speaks to people.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_02
 Well, what if we, I at home have a remote that has the most familiar buttons on the top, and the bottom side of the front has a little clap.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_02
 You can click away, and then you have much more functions that most people don't use, but some do.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_01
 But I think the most functions underneath that.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_01
 Clip, aren't as much.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_02
 Well, but they usually, their features are important.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_02
 They want to.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_04
 But not.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_04
 But what kind of features?

0:25:15	SPEAKER_04
 I think these screens are more traditional.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_04
 But most look at the numbers.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_05
 The new features are, like I said, LCD and speech control.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_05
 Our audience, these people, are very like these features.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_05
 So we must build in something, or they will go to the concurrent.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_05
 Our competitors.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_05
 So I do think we have to have some features.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_05
 Even though they cost a little more.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we could.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_02
 For some calculators, you have those little LCD, that you can click on or something, or you can click out of the remote.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_02
 And if that gives you a little bit of set of information.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_02
 Like a group of.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_05
 Which program you are watching or something.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_02
 Those kind of things.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_02
 Because you also have those program recognition for your PCRs.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_02
 And, yeah, right.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_02
 Well, if your remote picks that up also, they can display which program you're currently watching.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_01
 So it just signals the different.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, different symbols on the screen, because if you change to channel two, you have two on the screen and two on your.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_01
 For example, on your LCD screen.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_02
 It could be such a little that you can click in and out.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_02
 And you have it.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we should keep that simple too.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_01
 But should it really be clickable?

0:26:45	SPEAKER_01
 No, maybe.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's going to be integrated.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_01
 Just integrate in design to make it more.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_05
 More 20.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_05
 You said like this, you can watch.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, something like some radios in car.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_04
 Where it's walking.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_04
 Are they here?

0:27:00	SPEAKER_05
 They're coming by there.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's of course a bit more expensive than the basic calculated design.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_01
 But the scrolling text and that kind of thing.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I think it's just scripted.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_02
 It keeps it rolling.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_02
 And it's not that it's five minutes of implementing time.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_02
 Five minutes.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, yeah, for programming.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, so I don't think that's the issue.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_05
 All right.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_05
 All right.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_02
 We go with the LCD screen.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I think so, yes.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, well, we still need to know how much that will cost.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_04
 Right?

0:27:32	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know if I can find that.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_04
 No, but maybe you'll get that information.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, right.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_02
 We can use this board again, I think.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_02
 We can put some decisions about the controls we want, the issue.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_02
 Where's my presentation?

0:27:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, understand.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_05
 We should have a general idea of how it's going to look.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we're here now, I think.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_02
 I've already given you.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_02
 So we have to decide on the different remote control functions.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_02
 So we want to have a small LCD screen.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_01
 Should we start with the most important part?

0:28:23	SPEAKER_01
 LCD screen at the bottom.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_01
 All right, but we should start with the power button.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_05
 How do you set?

0:28:30	SPEAKER_05
 You just sit in your chair.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_00
 Huh?

0:28:33	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to be able to do the LCD screen on top of it.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_04
 It's a little bit terrible.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_04
 The natural, because most of the remote has some space left at the bottom.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_05
 But that's where your handphone might be.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_01
 And then we should centralize the discussion here.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know what to do.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_01
 No, I'm not.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_05
 We're busy with something.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, right.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_05
 Do you think it's better to put the LCD at the bottom?

0:29:00	SPEAKER_05
 And I think it's better at the top.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_01
 Why do you think it's better at the bottom?

0:29:04	SPEAKER_04
 Well, because most remote have some space left at the bottom.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_04
 And that way you can keep the shape recognizable for it.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_04
 It's really.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_01
 But you just can put the whole interface a bit down.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_05
 And for the integration, that's actually like small.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_05
 It's wide.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_05
 It's not high.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_05
 Well, Mike has a point.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_02
 Because when I use a remote, I hate the buttons at the bottom.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_02
 Bottom.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_02
 So, and I like to use the ones.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_02
 On the top.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_02
 So when I have to.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I agree with you.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_01
 With few functions, you know, it's also more recognizable.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_01
 It looks more like a calculator to people if you have the.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, but we don't want that.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_02
 You don't want them to look like a calculator.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_02
 You want to look at.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_02
 Like hour.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_02
 Original.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you don't have to throw an important aspect.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_01
 Like familiarity.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_01
 Completely away.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_01
 Because I think it's a.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's still important to have it at the top.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_02
 Because it's more familiar.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_05
 That's more familiar.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_01
 That's the problem.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_05
 When I draw here.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_05
 It's a bit off.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's a little bit.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_02
 It needs to be calibration.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_02
 No, let's talk about that later.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_02
 You shoot another pen.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe that's better.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_01
 Where?

0:30:33	SPEAKER_01
 Now, now, now, now, you only have one.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_05
 Especially that screen.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_05
 Right, we have to make a decision now.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:30:40	None
 We don't have much time.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_05
 I think we have a few functions and we can put the LSD above it.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_05
 I still have lots of room at the bottom.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you can put it right.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_02
 I think it should be at the bottom.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I'm the.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_02
 I'm the.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_04
 The last.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_05
 I thought we were.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_05
 We're two with VS 2.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_02
 Well, but what if we.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_02
 We first decide the different functions.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_03
 And then look at the design.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_01
 We were busy with that.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we shoot some on the.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_01
 The different aspects of the thing.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_01
 So we have the power button.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_05
 More of, I think that you two should be.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_05
 Come to consensus about the LSD.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_05
 Your.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_05
 Your job.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, of course, yeah, it's.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we have a power button.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_01
 Guys, you have to agree.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_01
 I can say, von, it's like this.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_01
 I agree.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_01
 We have a power button.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_02
 Seven buttons.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_02
 LSD window.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_02
 The number buttons.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_01
 Channel.

0:31:33	None
 Yeah.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_01
 Volume.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_01
 Volume control.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, let's look at your.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_02
 The mute button.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_02
 I love that one.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_04
 Uh-huh.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_04
 I think we should use something like this.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_04
 To.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_04
 The channel up and channel down button.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, in circle, you know.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_04
 Well, that's also designed.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_01
 Next.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_01
 Well, on this remote, these controls are for something else.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_04
 Or do you think they were something else?

0:32:14	SPEAKER_04
 They are for some.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_04
 Drop some of these buttons.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_05
 You should.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_05
 Put that power button channel.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_05
 And volume should have the most.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_05
 Importance.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_04
 I think this should be in one big circle in the middle.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but what he said about the RZ was kind of true.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_05
 When you put them all in the same place, the most used buttons, you're doing the same thing all the time.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_05
 And that's just what RZ is all about.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_05
 So it might be smarter to put them a little more parts away from each other.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_02
 So people have to move their hands.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_02
 And they get less complaints of RZ.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one end.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_01
 That's what I always do because all my important buttons are going to stay in place from time to time.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_04
 But people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_01
 No, but they have to be sent.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_01
 Would we have to choose frequency with button use?

0:33:16	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_05
 The most used channels are most used within the hour.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_05
 So the channel buttons should be far apart.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_05
 I think open down.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_05
 Open down.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_05
 Far apart from each other.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_05
 You're thinking about RZ.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_05
 Well, not too much.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_04
 But the other two frustrations are far more important.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_01
 I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_01
 But you don't have to have volume control.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_01
 For example, the power button.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_04
 You can use four times.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_02
 If someone is constantly zapping, it's not going to miss that the power button is not right beside.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_02
 Because I have another one.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_02
 That one can be put away.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_04
 The power button should be left at the top.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_02
 It should be left.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, man, five minutes.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_05
 Well, five minutes left.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_05
 Just make some decisions.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_05
 The most important things we have to...

0:34:28	SPEAKER_02
 How are we going to do it with those buttons?

0:34:30	SPEAKER_01
 We can use the drawing board now.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_01
 I think it doesn't work well.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_01
 It's pretty nice if we could draw a simple thing.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well, it's going to take too much time.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_05
 You decide that.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_05
 You decide that.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_05
 All right.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_02
 Well, the LCD.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_02
 You are industrial.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_02
 You are user interface.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_02
 So I think it's going to go to Mike.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_02
 But you will have to make consensus with Tyson.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_04
 Well, consensus.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_02
 It's a bit hard because we are going to be individually.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_02
 We are deciding now.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_05
 Top of the problem.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I still think it's quite important.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, it is.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_01
 At the top, so you say familiarity is important.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_02
 Well, what if we are going to now decide about the functions and the design comes into the next round?

0:35:25	SPEAKER_02
 The design round is still to come.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_02
 So, we agreed we do have LCDs.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_02
 That's all right.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_02
 The number thing.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_02
 That's enough.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_02
 Are we going to do it like on Mike's screen with one button that says I'm going to do a two-number digital?

0:35:44	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_02
 How do you want it to do then?

0:35:47	SPEAKER_02
 There's one to three or five of you.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_02
 It has to recognize one as it can still come more.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_04
 No, if you almost TVs, if you press two numbers, shortly after each other.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, it recognizes that.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_03
 So, no button for that.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_03
 That's very easy.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_02
 Anyone, anyone, on other functionalities of our remote?

0:36:10	SPEAKER_01
 I think these are the most important things.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_05
 You still have the pictures over there?

0:36:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:36:15	None
 So.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, that's right.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_05
 You do need a milk or a different, no.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_05
 Like this one.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_05
 You do that.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_05
 No, we did just chat.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_02
 We didn't do.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_05
 Are we?

0:36:34	SPEAKER_05
 All right.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_02
 No, okay.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_02
 Well, because we can integrate with any other remotes, all those buttons on those pictures are irrelevant.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_02
 So, just for a television, is the door we need?

0:36:50	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_05
 It's most usable this way.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_01
 So, it's very, very, very, very function.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_02
 Data text is gone.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_02
 So, all those buttons that are to do with data text, oh, screen placing.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_02
 You have those buttons about, and there's two important ones we're forgetting.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_02
 There's a screen.

0:37:11	SPEAKER_02
 You can make it wider and less wide.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_02
 And the button that you can go to, ah, for your video.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_05
 I don't think we have to put that underneath the clip.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_03
 Those two, or just two?

0:37:22	SPEAKER_01
 Just two under under it.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_01
 That's a bit waste.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_04
 We can make a little row of like four buttons down here.

0:37:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_03
 Or, I think, at the top.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_03
 Your LSDscar is going to go.

0:37:34	SPEAKER_01
 You can put two or three buttons under another section.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_01
 That's too complicated.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_01
 You can just put it somewhere.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, they aren't used much, not as much as those others.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_01
 So, you can put it somewhere.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_01
 They're smaller.

0:37:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's a bit smaller.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_01
 And, well, and I think more at the bottom.

0:37:51	None
 Yeah, or at the top.

0:37:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_01
 What do you think, ah, those buttons?

0:37:57	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I think that should, in an isolated part, the remote.

0:38:01	SPEAKER_01
 And where?

0:38:02	SPEAKER_01
 Or, ah, we designed it later.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_01
 We have it.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_01
 And we designed later where everything goes.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_02
 Well, and the other, ah, well, if you, why don't those video, if you, go to video, let's always on your remote control.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but to have the, ah, the video channel.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, you can set to the video channel from zero.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, not always.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_01
 Not a zero remote.

0:38:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, zero is a different channel than, ah, the video channel.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but when you set down zero, you get too happy.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, I don't.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_02
 I go to 99.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_02
 Then you press 99.

0:38:33	SPEAKER_04
 I think go to video is.

0:38:36	SPEAKER_04
 That's the button.

0:38:37	SPEAKER_01
 But it's easy to go.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_01
 If you are at a channel 55 and you want to, ah, go immediately to the video channel, you do, you have to push to get to zero.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_01
 Now, you can be low zero.

0:38:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:50	SPEAKER_03
 More easy to get to, ah, with the specific, ah,

0:38:52	SPEAKER_02
 the video channel. I use it.

0:38:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but if you're choosing to incorporate these buttons, you have to have a channel setting.

0:39:00	SPEAKER_05
 If you want, if you have a new TV, you have to set the channels.

0:39:03	SPEAKER_05
 All these different buttons, you have to.

0:39:05	SPEAKER_02
 Even if I don't have buttons for channels, I think, especially on my remote.

0:39:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, well, it's different screen settings.

0:39:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, plus and down.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_04
 You have one button from set frequency or something.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_04
 And then with plus and minus, you can adjust the, ah,

0:39:22	SPEAKER_05
 that's the only one we put in there. Shall we show, ah, one for, for a screen, ah, for, ah, channel setting?

0:39:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, to, ah, yeah, of course, to configure the program.

0:39:36	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, no, K button.

0:39:37	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, you always have in the center, an okay button.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, for your menu.

0:39:43	SPEAKER_02
 Menu button.

0:39:44	SPEAKER_01
 You should, yeah, I think that's important.

0:39:47	SPEAKER_01
 Uh, channel setting menu.

0:39:49	SPEAKER_01
 And then the settings to change the brightness.

0:39:51	SPEAKER_01
 The settings to change the brightness and the contrast.

0:39:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:39:55	SPEAKER_03
 Channel, yeah.

0:39:56	SPEAKER_02
 So, ah, chief.

0:39:58	SPEAKER_03
 Chief.

0:40:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, say, the menu button is also important.

0:40:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I have to put it in.

0:40:05	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I don't see it.

0:40:08	SPEAKER_01
 Here.

0:40:09	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, menu, all right.

0:40:11	SPEAKER_04
 It's like a contrast and brightness should be in the menu.

0:40:15	SPEAKER_01
 In the menu, yeah.

0:40:16	SPEAKER_01
 And you can then adjust it with the Japanese buttons or something.

0:40:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the settings buttons are juxtaposed.

0:40:22	SPEAKER_02
 If you are in the menu, guys, we're going to, ah, rooms and, ah, we'll have to decide things on our own, I think.

0:40:29	SPEAKER_02
 Great.

0:40:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, chief.

0:40:32	SPEAKER_05
 All right.

0:40:33	SPEAKER_05
 Well, see you.

0:40:34	SPEAKER_02
 We have lunchtime, by the way.

0:40:36	SPEAKER_02
 Now, ah, so, ah, I'm hungry.

0:40:38	SPEAKER_01
 Lunch.

0:40:39	SPEAKER_05
 You had to do my belly.

0:40:41	SPEAKER_02
 Ah, we didn't exactly do everything, man.

0:40:44	SPEAKER_02
 And we're going to pause and stick, in to it, right?

0:40:47	SPEAKER_04
 See you later, right?

0:40:48	SPEAKER_02
 So, I must have done something close and close.

0:40:53	SPEAKER_02
 I've done the closing, eh?

0:40:54	SPEAKER_02
 I must have done something close and close.

0:40:56	None
 I've done something close.

0:40:57	SPEAKER_02
 I've done something close and close and close.

0:40:58	SPEAKER_02

0:41:04	None
