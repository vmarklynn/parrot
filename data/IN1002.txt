0:00:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so should I start?

0:00:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_00
 So I think it's better to first have a presentation of my work and then we can discuss with this crash in temp in temp what we can do for my future to continue my research because apparently I will have serious problems.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_00
 So we'll start with the presentation of my work.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_04
 You can be sitting here, let's open, do the presentation.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, I will start.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so my work is generally about using posterior in speech recognition systems and somehow enhancing the estimation of posterior getting new posterior which are more informative by somehow integrating some extra knowledge like prior knowledge and contextual information related to the problem.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_00
 And then use this posterior estimation method for designing hierarchical speech recognition systems.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_00
 So in this hierarchical architecture I will be able to integrate extra knowledge at the proper level of hierarchy and I will be also able to combine different kind of knowledge or sources of knowledge I have.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_00
 Well, as you know, generally, posteriors are estimated using neural networks and more specifically MLPs in a speech recognition system.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_00
 So time limited window of speech signal is represented by some capsule features which are then processed by an MLP and it gives us some evidence in the form of phone posteriors.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_00
 When we use this phone posteriors as features or as scores for either just decoding or training and inference training and decoding.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_00
 But we know that in this case we are not able to integrate contextual information, long contextual information and we are not able to integrate the prior knowledge we can have about phone use or about words in the posteriors estimation.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_00
 So the main motivation is to see if we can integrate this kind of extra knowledge in the posteriors estimation.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_00
 So what is proposed to solve this problem is to use what we formally use in HMM formally which is called gamma state posterior as a posterior for training or decoding.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_00
 So as you know, it is a state posterior probability in HMM which is defined as the probability of being in a specific HMM state at a specific time having the whole observation sequence and the model.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_00
 So whole observation sequence means having complete contextual information and the model can encode some kind of prior knowledge for us by means of topological constraints.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_00
 Well you know this gamma posterior is written in terms of forward and backward HMM recursions and actually one way to use this gamma posterior is using this posterior as some kind of new scores for decoding.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_00
 So in this case it will be similar to hybrid method.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_00
 The difference is that we do one more step.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe I can explain it better there.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_00
 So we do one more step here and we here by means of another HMM we introduce some kind of prior knowledge and contextual information.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_00
 We get better evidences than what we initially had here and then we do the decoding and more informative posterior instead of this one.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_00
 So we are expecting the system to perform better and more robust to noisy cases.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_00
 Here you see some results and how what is the effect of introducing reasonable prior knowledge.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_00
 So different rows in this table are showing different level of noise and also clean speech and different columns are showing different kind of posterior or gamma posterior.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_00
 So the first column is showing our baseline system which is getting estimated of posterior out of MLP and then using these posterior for decoding and the other columns are showing the performance of different kind of gamma.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_00
 So gamma which is estimated using information about minimum duration of phonemes about possible transition between phonemes and some more prior knowledge like which word is composed of which phonemes and grammatical knowledge about transition between words and things like this.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_00
 So as you see introducing more reasonable prior knowledge will help to have better performance in almost all the cases.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_00
 And here I compare the performance of the gamma based system with the standard HMM-GMM system which is based on doing decoding using likelihoods at the scores and the difference is that our system is using posterior for decoding.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_00
 So as you see it's working better than the standard HMM-GMM system.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_00
 And finally the conclusion is here we saw how we can get some more informative posterior by introducing extra knowledge like prior and contextual information and then using this posterior estimation method to design hierarchical speech recognition system which the goal is to have better, more efficient and more robust system.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_00
 So if you want now we can discuss about the crash and the loss of data.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_00
 So well I lost all the posteriors.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_00
 I was, I used as input for my system.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_00
 So the gamma are somehow estimated or computed on top of posteriors.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_00
 Now I don't have any posterior and probably the script generating that posterior.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_00
 So what I can do.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_03
 You go to the table you have there like the big table with all that then we can discuss.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_03
 So which I think I have all the gamma, especially gamma full models I have.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_00
 Gamma full model but what about other ones and what about the posteriors?

0:08:25	SPEAKER_00
 The posteriors because I cannot stop my research.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_00
 I may do something else in future with this and well I need posteriors.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_04
 Now you need the different methods from how from gamma you can tell.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_03
 Posteriors.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_03
 Even you have those three state performance gamma.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_03
 You have all these.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_00
 No, no I don't have them.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_00
 They are all under 10.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_00
 We have that because you have stored them.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_00
 You know you can write another paper if you can.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe some other PhD students should be hired to work on gamma.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_00
 Gamma is supposed to be generating gamma.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_04
 I was just, let's talk a little about this presentation itself.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_04
 The slide number 6.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_04
 How you feel it is important that you are taking the context of the whole utterance.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_04
 How important it could be.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_04
 Is it not a possibility that you are having less context?

0:09:30	SPEAKER_04
 Less context.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_04
 We mean.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_04
 Instead of having context from one to capital T which is for the whole utterance.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_04
 Which doesn't make much sense.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_04
 In general.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_04
 So what is the possibility that you can cut the context?

0:09:42	SPEAKER_04
 Instead of having a context from.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_00
 You mean a smaller context instead of this.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_04
 It might be left to write everything there but not the whole context.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_04
 Because it's a fact that when you are having one utterance.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_04
 So one utterance is like a full sentence or something and there might not be much breaks in it.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_04
 So in that sense it doesn't make sense that you are going too much in the past and then you are trying to cut something which is not related.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_00
 Well, even they can have some information which are not so meaningful or which are not related.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_00
 Well, but then I will have the problem to find the optimum amount of context.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_00
 How much context should I take?

0:10:24	SPEAKER_04
 Kind of.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_04
 Two hundred.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_04
 That's a Phoenix idea is usually 100 milliseconds.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_03
 Two hundred milliseconds.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_04
 One second.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_03
 So but for numbers I think it may be okay.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_03
 Numbers hardly.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_03
 Numbers it might be okay because most of the sentences might be three seconds or something.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_03
 Even less than that.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_03
 Just few words.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_03
 It is or something like if it is really long sentence of ten seconds or something you may not really need.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_04
 So that's that much of context to computer governments.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_03
 And it's really computationally very intensive also like if you.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_00
 That's a good idea.

0:10:58	None
 That's reasonable.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_04
 So when we are talking about them then my stories are the worst I think.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_03
 So because yeah, all the post videos are from you only.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_04
 I cannot generate post videos.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_04
 And so there is.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_00
 And you don't have a script for.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_00
 I don't have the C files also.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_00
 You don't you have just your thesis.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_00
 God has stopped my my work.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_00
 He has said that enough is enough.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_00
 And what could happen if you don't even have your thesis?

0:11:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_04
 Then I would have taken two years extension.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, you know.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_04
 It was it was pretty scary.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_04
 And let's see what happens.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_03
 But for your case, you don't need really complicated post.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_03
 You just need some PLPs and then.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you can then read and read it.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_02
 No, because it's more did it on what?

0:11:55	SPEAKER_02
 Um, and one of couple of.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_00
 On C experiments, right?

0:11:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_00
 For CTS Peter still I think has both there.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_00
 He didn't lose anything.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_03
 No, but he's he may be linking to Matthew.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_03
 I guess because Matthew got the way.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_02
 Probably might.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_03
 But you got the all the way file.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_02
 So yeah, but the way file is the same, the temple.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_02
 So that's what I'm saying.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_02
 That I can recover it back from.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_03
 So if he got features, then it took otherwise if he has to generate again, he can't generate.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_04
 Because when, uh, path has lost a lot.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_04
 He's having only the results with him.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_04
 So he doesn't have the files.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_02
 The real.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_02
 Everything, see, if they say that we cannot recover it, then I can quickly get it back from it.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_02
 See a couple of days I can put all the system back.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_03
 But everybody has features in temple and most of the time all the CTS features or CTS we find.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_03
 So forget about CTS at least now.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_03
 I think we will see it again.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_03
 But he's going to download that much of data.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_03
 It takes at least one or two weeks.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, I can now see downloading is another thing.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_02
 One thing you have to do.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_02
 That they have data in one particular structure.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_02
 So I have to first of all, you know, organize, create our files and then I can get it back here.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_03
 But you said you need to do some segmentation also not to put that.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_04
 And then you have to get their PLP features and.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_02
 That I can get all those things.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_04
 Because those files are also very big.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_02
 They are not single files.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_02
 But they should not be any big.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_02
 They should not be any big.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_02
 The only thing is that now if they have to say that we cannot recover it.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the we can wait at least one or two weeks for this.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_02
 One day, one, one, two days like this week I can wait and see if they cannot recover it, then I can just get all the data from XC and put back the CTS.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_03
 But still I think we can't really do these things before I guess.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_03
 No, we can.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_03
 So that's like maybe we can concentrate what especially on numbers now and then we can go to CTS.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_03
 So in numbers case what you really need.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_00
 Just put your estimated using PLP features for number.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we can.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_03
 We need to generate again PLP.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_03
 But we files are there.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, PLP numbers 95 databases.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, PLP's are also last.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, PLP's.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_02
 Everything is last.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_02
 Everything is last.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_02
 Everything is last.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_04
 And if you really asked me even the structure which was there real every point by point how PLP's were generated, that information is also not there.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_03
 But you're generating PLP's from FICO.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but the parameters which are exact.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_04
 But at least hopefully 95% I know but that 5% that you can't do.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_04
 And then we need to train the new weights because MLP training needs to be done and then only the next step will happen.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_04
 So it's pretty whole thing is stupid whether we can replicate the results, whatever results you are showing whether we can replicate them or not.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_04
 Presently it's not known.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_03
 But at least you have something to verify there.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_03
 So PLP's these are all 13 just only PLP's not Delta's in Delta.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_00
 No, there is not Delta.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_00
 And there is another problem for verifying this results because well for this results you know the configuration should not be well.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_00
 I also saved the configuration somewhere in the temp.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_00
 So exactly how many states for decoding and which kind of language model and things like this.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_00
 I think I can remember almost all of them but it's a bit.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_03
 But if you got something from Hammond or Maitre then I have those number of states like we have there it's only for only close DCL, KCL they have.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no, no.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_04
 He's using different setup I think.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_04
 No, he got from you.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_04
 Do you use our setup for the number of states?

0:16:00	SPEAKER_04
 For the confirmation?

0:16:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_03
 I think so then I have those number of states.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_04
 No, those things I'm also having because they were done two years back.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_04
 Anything which is done in the last two years is the one which is.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_03
 So you didn't have any PLP files.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_03
 So what about these noise levels?

0:16:24	SPEAKER_03
 We have noise wave files in the COM database.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_03
 So we have directly with wave files with particular noise added.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_04
 No, those things are not disturbed.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_02
 They are all in the database section.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_04
 Nothing related to the database has been disturbed.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_03
 No, but I think the switchboard.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but also we have it but one thing is that we don't have all the data within it.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_03
 But the problem is like all these SNRs I think it may not be there in databases.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, they're there.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_03
 You added already called the noise.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, it was pre-written there.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_03
 It's in the database itself.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_03
 Even with SNRs.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_03
 That's right.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_03
 Then it's okay.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_03
 Even an EVFOM we have it.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so that is not a problem.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_03
 So it's not that you're added all the...

0:17:12	SPEAKER_03
 No, I didn't do it myself.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_03
 With SNR, different SNRs.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_04
 That part is less scary.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_03
 So at least we have wave files.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_03
 So now we can generate anything in a PLP or so at least.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_04
 So the things which are related to your PLP can be done I think.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_04
 It's not such a major problem.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_00
 So as a conclusion there is no major problem except...

0:17:36	SPEAKER_00
 No, I think that's like a problem.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_00
 So how much time does it want to spend again?

0:17:41	SPEAKER_04
 MLP needs to be trained and the PLP features so it's kind of one and a half days work.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_04
 Kind of to generate the new points.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_03
 But for all these SNRs, so that's also...

0:17:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that means it'll add up, that's it.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_04
 But all of it is doable in three, four days time.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_00
 I also had stored a set of generated posterior or gamma or CX like this which I should regenerate.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_00
 I have the scripts but it takes time.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_00
 It's CPU and regenerating all these things.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so there is no major problem except time.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_00
 Deadline of two weeks for ICAS.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_04
 I don't have to generate any new results.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_04
 I'm also on the other side then.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_04
 But if I need to generate new results then...

0:18:34	SPEAKER_04
 Anyway, there is emotional loss, so much of scripts and codes.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_03
 No, the thing is like you can't really write this script.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_03
 Especially the code is real problem.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_03
 Script is okay.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_03
 Even scripts also the configurations or if you forget something, some even preemphasis factor or something it's really...

0:18:53	SPEAKER_04
 Means losses are emotional as well as whatever it is there.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_04
 Manar and blah blah.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_04
 But...

0:19:00	SPEAKER_04
 Stretchity.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_04
 So, rate five you have told to the...

0:19:08	SPEAKER_02
 It looks like if you get three disks gone then it's very difficult to get it.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_02
 Which disk?

0:19:14	SPEAKER_02
 If it's one disk it's fine.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_02
 Three disks.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_02
 Because at least one is having the...

0:19:19	SPEAKER_02
 No, one does there is no problem.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_02
 Meadows will be causing the mirror.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_02
 But if the three disks are gone it's very difficult.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_02
 So, I don't know how it went.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_02
 Usually as soon as one disk fails it should be replaced.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_02
 Actually...

0:19:39	SPEAKER_03
 It should be replaced by...

0:19:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, otherwise it will go on destroying other disks.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_02
 So the one...

0:19:46	SPEAKER_02
 So I don't know how it happened.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_02
 You know?

0:19:50	SPEAKER_02
 Such a thing.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_02
 Like usually as soon as one fails it actually notifies the system administrator or...

0:19:56	SPEAKER_02
 It makes certain kind of noise.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_03
 You know, mirror is into the sky.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_02
 To make sure that it has to be replaced.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_02
 So if the disk is not replaced then it will fail.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_02
 That's an internal recovery.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_02
 If you just replace the disk then it can internally it can quickly recover everything into that disk.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_02
 So it's like, you know, if you have...

0:20:29	SPEAKER_02
 If you have...

0:20:30	SPEAKER_02
 It's kind of like essentially if it is like 120, 100, 100 GB there are data space then it essentially will have 200 GB only visible data to you.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_02
 But then it can...

0:20:42	SPEAKER_02
 As soon as you replace one of those hard disks it can...

0:20:45	SPEAKER_02
 It can from the other one it can recover everything on that.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_02
 Ah, it will have mirror also.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_02
 Inter internally it can do that kind of thing.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_02
 But if the three disks fail then it's...

0:20:54	SPEAKER_02
 It's a really difficult job.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know how it can be recovered.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_02
 Probably the one way that they extend the hard disks to the people who are experts and they do like sector, basic or block by block with either the cover.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_02
 But that's very expensive.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_02
 But the two LEDs.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, a simple thing might cost you minimum 10,000 euros.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_03
 But even this may be really huge data also.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_04
 Was it insured?

0:21:24	SPEAKER_04
 Any idea?

0:21:25	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if it was insured.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think insured is coming in here.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_02
 No, no.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_04
 Insurance can take care of means.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_04
 Anything can be insured in this word-lown is.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_03
 I think maybe some companies differently they will insure obviously.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_03
 You can't really have so many backups.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_04
 But this term means one thing which is mistreat to me.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_04
 Why 10.1 and 10.2 are residing on the same hard disk.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_02
 No, it was because it was not 10.1 and 10.2.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_02
 But they have the same...

0:21:59	SPEAKER_02
 It has three GPs.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_02
 Three disks hard disks category.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_02
 So you can go up to 14 or something like that.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_02
 But it can be on the same thing.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so it means...

0:22:09	SPEAKER_03
 It's just partitioning.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_03
 But so that...

0:22:11	SPEAKER_02
 So it tries to put...

0:22:13	SPEAKER_02
 It tries to quickly put things in this way.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_02
 But only thing is that only one swipe has backup.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_02
 Keep taking up the backup.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_02
 So it puts everything quickly.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_02
 It can decide wherever it wants to put.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_02
 So it's faster to do that way.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, no.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_04
 What I'm saying means...

0:22:33	SPEAKER_04
 10.1 and 10.2 could have been different systems.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_02
 No, I think that is a soft name they have given the...

0:22:39	SPEAKER_04
 I'm saying they could have kept differently.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but then what is the use of RAID then?

0:22:45	SPEAKER_04
 No, RAID on both the systems.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_04
 What's the problem?

0:22:47	SPEAKER_02
 No, but that is what the RAID can allow you to keep up to 14 hard disks.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_04
 Hard disks?

0:22:54	SPEAKER_04
 There are already five hard disks growing.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so they have five.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_02
 And you can go up to 14 if you want to keep there.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_02
 And it can still work.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_02
 And it has...

0:23:03	SPEAKER_02
 And the way it looked like is still for Talva and you know...

0:23:07	SPEAKER_02
 The way it is.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_02
 Usually it is just that if you want these crashes before...

0:23:12	SPEAKER_02
 If it is replaced quickly, then no problems.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_02
 Otherwise, unsafe data will start.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_02
 The first thing is get lost.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_02
 That's the thing.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, now everybody is going to be scared of temps.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, no temps.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 The amperes, no, it's anyway.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_02
 I think they can do because some of these people are experts.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_02
 There are a couple of experts in Switzerland itself.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_02
 So if they can easily recover it, probably, do this kind of thing.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_03
 But is it really costly?

0:23:56	SPEAKER_03
 This system is...

0:23:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it depends on the job.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_02
 You know, sometimes it's a small hardware thing.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_02
 They might do it within, you know, 5000 euros and all.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_02
 But if it's very much detailed work, they will just...

0:24:10	SPEAKER_02
 The whole thing starts like this, that you have to give your credit card number and sign a form.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_02
 And then only they will start taking your hard disk.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, no, no.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_04
 I checked over the net, it's not the way.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_04
 You send the things to them.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_04
 They will see if they can recover, then only they'll ask you that this is the quotation.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, no.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_04
 But if there is no...

0:24:32	SPEAKER_04
 If they cannot recover, they will send it back.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no, that's what they say.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_02
 Like, you do it, then send it the hard disk.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_02
 Then they will say, okay, we can do it.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_02
 And then if you do it, we can do it.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, no.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_04
 First they'll give you a quotation.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_04
 They won't go without that.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_04
 It's not...

0:24:47	SPEAKER_04
 It means it's a wrong information.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe at least they will give you some number, otherwise they'll...

0:24:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_04
 Because in the beginning, what they say that send us the thing, we look at the things.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_04
 If it is recoverable, we will tell you what is the quotation.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_04
 What is the estimate of that?

0:24:59	SPEAKER_04
 And if it is not recoverable, we will send it back to you.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_04
 That means... and if they cannot recover it, then what they won't charge anything from you for the inspection.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_02
 No, I think that's it.

0:25:14	None
 Yeah.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_03
 At least they will know beforehand.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_03
 That's right.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, for they can go...

0:25:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_04
 It means looking at how much failure has happened.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_04
 Accordingly, they will tell you whether they can recover or not.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_02
 And in fact, if they can go a lot, but they can go block by block and look into it and try to recover.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_02
 But that much you will want to go or not is a question.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_03
 But even how much important data...

0:25:39	SPEAKER_03
 Sometimes it's just MP3 or something, so you don't really need to...

0:25:43	SPEAKER_02
 And it's like 40 tera-al.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_02
 For 4 tera, you know?

0:25:46	SPEAKER_02
 4 tera, I guess.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_02
 There was somewhere else to like...

0:25:50	SPEAKER_04
 So how much is 4 tera?

0:25:52	SPEAKER_04
 4000 gigabytes?

0:25:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, 4000 gigabytes.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, 4000 gigabytes.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_02
 4000 gigabytes?

0:25:57	SPEAKER_02
 Not much.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_02
 That's a big...

0:26:03	SPEAKER_03
 But now we got something like...

0:26:05	SPEAKER_04
 Isn't it?

0:26:06	SPEAKER_04
 8.1 is more fault-out-length as compared to 8.5.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_03
 No, 8.5 is better.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_04
 Exactly.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_04
 8.1 is having exactly 50% capacity is utilized.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_04
 It's copy.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_04
 Two copies of the same thing will be existing.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_04
 That is the 8.1.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_03
 But 8.5 is 10, 20% copy only.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_03
 That's right.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_03
 8.5 is 20%.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's not the other way.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_04
 So, 8.1 is exactly...

0:26:30	SPEAKER_04
 It means that's a lot of wastage of resources, but it's more fault-out-length.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_04
 And there is no parity kind of or anything.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_04
 Nothing exists there.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_04
 So, the disk which has crashed, that cannot be recovered.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_04
 The disk which has not crashed, it can be recovered completely.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_04
 It means if both the disk have crashed for the same data, you cannot recover anything.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_04
 If one disk has crashed, then you can recover everything.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_04
 It will be the other disk.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_04
 It will be in the other disk.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_04
 So, that is the 8.1.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_02
 Anyway, Hamid, how do you want to go about it?

0:27:00	SPEAKER_04
 If you are given a choice, you want to take red one or red five or a simple laptop.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_02
 I would say how would you like to go about with ICASP?

0:27:09	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I think after this meeting, we can try together to regenerate this.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_00
 Well, PLPs, I think they should be first regenerated and posterior, then if by the end of week we could have posterior, it's not that difficult.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_00
 I can easily regenerate the commas and do all the experiments again.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_00
 So, what are the experiments you need to do?

0:27:33	SPEAKER_04
 What are the new experiments you are having in your mind?

0:27:36	SPEAKER_00
 Mainly, there will be some experiment to check how the system is robust against this tuning factors like language modeling.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_00
 It's a language- It's a language-based technology.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_00
 This will be the main new issue.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_04
 And do you feel that there's paper material?

0:28:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, the new thing in the paper.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_03
 And also maybe like this noise is noisy case.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_04
 It was...

0:28:07	SPEAKER_04
 But the one which you have reported means you want to report something more than that?

0:28:11	SPEAKER_03
 Well, this is not in the paper.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, this was not in the paper.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_00
 I put it in the presentation, but it's not in the paper.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_00
 The paper was just for clean speech.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_00
 But since I had the results before, and I cannot copy these things, because I talked with Helvet and he said, okay, actually, the numbers are not very reasonable because they are just 13 PLP features and we have to have at least something which is known for people.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, they are expecting something around 1987 or something like this.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_00
 So anyway, I had to renew all the experiments, but now it's a little bit more difficult because before I had posteriors, and now we have two more steps, PLP's and then posteriors.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_03
 At least now he can know full system setup from him.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_04
 Why be what I can do? I can give you the setup.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, I can generate from bottom.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, train the MLP test.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you very much.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_03
 So now mainly like 39 PLP, you are always using 39.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_03
 I was using 39.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_03
 But then why these features, you gave me like they are 13?

0:29:26	SPEAKER_00
 I wanted to extend this.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_00
 Well, actually the paper we wanted to write was, for ICAST, was something related to multi-stream gamma.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no, no.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_00
 These ones like that, I will explain.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_00
 So my plan was to have two streams.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_00
 And I think that only one stream.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_00
 So I thought that one stream will be PLP and the other will be delta PLP.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_00
 So this was one part of experiment, so single stream, and then I wanted to combine delta with this and have another table.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_00
 So that was why.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_00
 But actually because the numbers and studies, it's not showing strong results.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_00
 Anyways, results are not very important, but they should be within a range of acceptable numbers.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_00
 So then for now I think it's better to instead of doing PLP and delta PLP, I can have single stream of 39 PLPs and then combine them with traps.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, those results only, you reported an interest speech, like 39 PLP results.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, 39.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's why they were less than 10% more or less.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_03
 No, even like clean speech.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_04
 What is this result?

0:30:42	SPEAKER_04
 This was related to your MLMI?

0:30:45	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, it's interest speech.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, this is just...

0:30:50	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, these numbers are full PLP 39.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_00
 Wow, okay.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_00
 But just to make things clear in the presentation to show more steps.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_04
 What is the tri-phone numbers?

0:31:01	SPEAKER_02
 Here is the tri-phone MLP.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, okay.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_04
 Your MLP.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_03
 No, he gave scale likelihoods to me than I generated gammas.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_04
 Even those gammas will be same as normalized scale likelihoods.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_03
 They are passing through the data from that.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because I have tri-phone, GMMs and HMMMs.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_03
 So he gave me scale likelihoods of tri-phones.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_04
 Not scale likelihoods.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_03
 Scale likelihoods.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_03
 Scale likelihoods.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_03
 Scale likelihoods.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_02
 From?

0:31:31	SPEAKER_02
 From tri-phone number.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, they gave me a chip.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, MLP scale likelihoods.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_04
 Well, you are having post-tators there, right?

0:31:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so I divided by the pliers.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_02
 Pliers, yeah.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_04
 That's how you do it.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so it's the next place.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_03
 Then again, I will pass through full network.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_03
 Then I can generate tri-phone gammas.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_04
 And full network, what was the architecture?

0:31:48	SPEAKER_03
 It's like Word.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's just GMM Word models.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_03
 You have all the connections to between all the words.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:31:57	SPEAKER_04
 What are the other things we need to discuss?

0:32:05	SPEAKER_03
 So then first thing is like we need to generate PLPs.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_03
 And then all this SNR's PLPs.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's amazing that everything was under there.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_02
 No, but I think what I think there is still some data which is the cover of, well, at least they could give us time to, I think that the most of those things should be there.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_02
 I can copy it already.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_03
 No, it was there on like, yesterday morning, also even.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_03
 So I was running some experiments and then it was okay, but it's readable only, so I can't write anything.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_02
 No, you don't have to write, but it can be.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so but we don't know, like, we thought like, I thought it's recovering, so maybe by tomorrow I'll get everything.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_03
 So, because if you want to copy again, you will have...

0:32:50	SPEAKER_04
 That's all because of you.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_04
 You came on wrong day from Iran.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_04
 You should have come on, Jumah. It would have been okay.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_03
 Anyway.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_03
 But yeah, still some people are in vacation, so they will really...

0:33:04	SPEAKER_00
 They'll get a shock of their life.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_00
 See, they will be back and...

0:33:08	SPEAKER_00
 With you?

0:33:09	SPEAKER_00
 But he's in it.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_00
 With you, I'll be there once you come back and you'll have to write their rights.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_00
 He flies to Senegal directly.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_02
 Sir, in Daniel's wife in Italy?

0:33:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_03
 But even all over the recent iteration, iterative training set up is intense.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_03
 We was like, how much we can copy because it's really so many iterations and...

0:33:30	SPEAKER_03
 Even without really completing many more experiments also.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but it's a major loss, no doubt.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_03
 But at least, yeah, scripts are there.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_03
 We're like, like, scripts are there, but...

0:33:45	SPEAKER_03
 So if...

0:33:46	SPEAKER_01
 The guy told me, he wanted to run the scripts, he's not there.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, if they can record at least Hammond's P-Files then...

0:33:53	SPEAKER_03
 They can...

0:33:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, if they can give me my C-Files then also, it's okay.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_03
 But C-Files, yeah.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_03
 Even if they give you P-Files, it's really bad, even you don't really need to run all the...

0:34:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because I don't need to generate features also.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's amazing.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_04
 And I don't need all my P-Files.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_04
 Just a few of them.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_03
 Hey, just only like, recent P-Files at least.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_00
 And what if we have someday a fire in India?

0:34:21	SPEAKER_00
 We will lose all the data.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_02
 And that is...

0:34:24	SPEAKER_02
 Anywhere fire will lose all the data.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, but they have...

0:34:28	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I think...

0:34:29	SPEAKER_00
 Not in...

0:34:30	SPEAKER_00
 That's not the case.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_00
 No, they physically also separate the...

0:34:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, they can, you know, the story somewhere.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, physically it is up with this.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_00
 But, you know, here we can easily have a fire because everything is made of food, I think, and it's small and...

0:34:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_02
 It's sprinkler something around here, I hope so.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_03
 Still I think I...

0:34:48	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, it's sprinklers.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_03
 I needn't worry, they had that big fire and then...

0:34:52	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, what if they're in sprinklers?

0:34:53	SPEAKER_03
 Don't worry.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_03
 Even even so, several of that buildings, I'm not all the computers in that building, they're all burnt, but...

0:34:59	SPEAKER_03
 They have like three backups in the university, so...

0:35:03	SPEAKER_03
 At least people, they didn't really affect much.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_03
 Whereas universities, maybe it's really big.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_02
 So they can afford...

0:35:10	SPEAKER_02
 And they can't...

0:35:11	SPEAKER_02
 They're shifted the whole thing around.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, they...

0:35:13	SPEAKER_02
 They won't keep it at one point.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_03
 They'll have backup at different...

0:35:16	SPEAKER_03
 Physically at different places.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_03
 And also in some underground, so that like...

0:35:20	SPEAKER_03
 Five proof or something.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, then you'll kill farmers out, you know.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, maybe.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, anyway.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_00
 The good conclusion is to have a backup and on CD at home.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_00
 No, CDs are not enough like...

0:35:36	SPEAKER_03
 CDs are not enough.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_03
 They're home.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_04
 Because one CD is home, which is not even one GB.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_04
 So then CDs are not enough.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_02
 Phone book, I can take care of everything on phone book, because I have it as a CD.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_02
 I wrote it once upon time to copy it to my home, and so I have all the data of my CD.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if I copied all the numbers that are on that.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_02
 You're talking about data, so you're talking about...

0:35:59	SPEAKER_02
 Data itself.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_02
 The whole feature to everything.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_02
 Feature, segmentation, every label file, everything is there.

0:36:06	SPEAKER_02
 I can recover it back from there actually.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_03
 But whatever it's a make-bulse, home directory, so...

0:36:11	SPEAKER_03
 He also kept everything in...

0:36:13	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, he was having a lot of many things in the proper places.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_04
 But in temp he was having a lot of important things.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_04
 All the experiments which he was running.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_03
 But he did mostly on numbers.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_03
 No, so at least if we can recover, we can read some of his stuff or something.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_03
 Did you look at it?

0:36:29	SPEAKER_03
 Is home, big ball, home speech, big ball or something?

0:36:33	SPEAKER_04
 Look what?

0:36:34	SPEAKER_03
 Look for any features or anything out there.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_04
 What we do with the switches?

0:36:38	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, he might be using the same PLP features or something.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no, no.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_04
 That way.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_04
 Might be but the situation is that he was generating his own PLP features from his own scripts.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_04
 He was not using doctor speech.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, he got his own.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_04
 So he was like...

0:36:57	SPEAKER_04
 So I borrowed few of the things from him.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_04
 The FFT routine.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_04
 And reading the signal waveform.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_04
 These things have borrowed from him and I changed.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_04
 And then I put it in my all programs.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_04
 So...

0:37:15	SPEAKER_04
 I kept the backups but those backups are themselves on them.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_04
 I didn't know that this way it can crash because I thought it might be...

0:37:25	SPEAKER_04
 I can do a mistake and wipe out the things.

0:37:27	SPEAKER_04
 And then there is no backup.

0:37:29	SPEAKER_04
 So I cannot blame anybody but I didn't know that.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_04
 The whole backup can itself crash.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_04
 So now in my life I will never believe anything which is temperature.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_04
 Whether it is temperature or whether it is temporary.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:37:49	SPEAKER_04
 Hey.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_04
 Because just few days back I took a backup of my laptop feeling the same thing.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_04
 But then I didn't realize that I should take a backup off.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_02
 Only good thing is that the numbers I think I pretty much can recover all the even the iPhone X-Men's.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_02
 Because I think I have kept those labels all the things that are pretty directly.

0:38:11	SPEAKER_02
 A P-Pile of it.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_02
 Then it's good that we don't really need it.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_02
 You don't need to back all those labels and everything.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_03
 So but your PLP is also there.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_02
 PLP should be there.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_02
 Should I have kept the PLP also somewhere there?

0:38:25	SPEAKER_03
 Then we just need to run neural not only.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah but PLP is hardly a few minutes.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_04
 PLP is hardly anything.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_02
 The extra work is like you know converting the segmentation from monophone to triphon.

0:38:41	SPEAKER_02
 This kind of thing.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_02
 Then all the scripts are there in the temp for that kind of thing.

0:38:46	SPEAKER_02
 Which scripts?

0:38:48	SPEAKER_04
 From Post-T-R-S to Post-A-L-M-N.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_02
 What you do is like you have the segmentation to train that for monophone right?

0:38:56	SPEAKER_02
 You can convert the same thing into triphon segmentation because there is monophone and tribal there are no different except that you're just going to give a different label to them depending on the context.

0:39:07	SPEAKER_02
 So it's easier to convert that segmentation directly here.

0:39:10	SPEAKER_02
 Rather than now you see the point that if you lose one.

0:39:15	SPEAKER_02
 So the thing is that I have to recover means I have to recover through the monophone segmentation the whole thing.

0:39:26	SPEAKER_03
 But you still need to run all the nets.

0:39:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah it's okay.

0:39:31	SPEAKER_02
 That's your number that's very fast.

0:39:33	SPEAKER_03
 No but it's not.

0:39:35	SPEAKER_03
 I think at least it takes two hours or three hours.

0:39:38	SPEAKER_02
 Three hours I think I end.

0:39:39	SPEAKER_02
 You can't parallelize also.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_02
 The thing is that right now you know almost what is the burn which will give you the best results.

0:39:47	SPEAKER_02
 You can convert.

0:39:48	SPEAKER_02
 Not in all cases.

0:39:49	SPEAKER_04
 That's the problem which people are facing.

0:39:52	SPEAKER_04
 Because everything was written then and there itself.

0:39:55	SPEAKER_04
 It means the optimization has been done.

0:39:57	SPEAKER_04
 They did the optimization there and they they worked on that started working on that.

0:40:01	SPEAKER_04
 They didn't write it with pen or something on a paper or saying that okay this is the best optimization.

0:40:07	SPEAKER_03
 So for example if you want to replicate all these results then he needs to use all my hammers.

0:40:14	SPEAKER_03
 PLP configuration then.

0:40:16	SPEAKER_04
 Because if I change my configuration and your results will be.

0:40:20	SPEAKER_04
 The results are somewhere else.

0:40:23	SPEAKER_03
 Then you don't know.

0:40:25	SPEAKER_03
 Anyway.

0:40:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay let's recover it.

0:40:29	SPEAKER_02
 Let's hope the best.

0:40:30	SPEAKER_02
 So how much time we have spent?

0:40:32	SPEAKER_03
 I think we have spent 35, 40 minutes.

0:40:36	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:40:37	SPEAKER_03
 So this is good enough.

0:40:38	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:40:39	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:40:40	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:40:41	SPEAKER_02
 Fine.

0:40:42	SPEAKER_04
 Have a good day.

0:40:43	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:40:44	SPEAKER_04
 Good.

0:40:50	SPEAKER_02
 Good.

0:40:52	SPEAKER_02
 So we had to leave first.

0:40:55	None
 Okay.
