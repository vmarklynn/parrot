0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 It's from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on rules for each of you.

0:00:12	SPEAKER_03
 However, there are some changes that I've got from on high that are a bit there.

0:00:21	SPEAKER_03
 What I didn't actually realize was that this is for a specific television.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_03
 So they're all in one idea because I don't know.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_03
 And they require that they...

0:00:36	SPEAKER_03
 I'll get to that as you see it's point number four.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_03
 And we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we're going to do from it.

0:00:45	SPEAKER_03
 So presentations, were you...

0:00:49	SPEAKER_03
 Anybody got?

0:00:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_03
 Wearing to go?

0:00:53	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_03
 I need to plug you in.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not just a...

0:01:11	SPEAKER_03
 It's a...

0:01:19	SPEAKER_02
 A inspired design.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_03
 Do you want me to move?

0:01:29	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just going to screw it in.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to swap it in.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_03
 With function F8.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_03
 Let's see, we blew one of the hearts out of the F8.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:01:53	None
 Yeah.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_00
 Me again, Raj as a marketing expert.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_00
 As we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_03
 Someone's fine.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sorry.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_00
 I have to look at the market potential for this product.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_00
 Consumer likings and everything.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_00
 What is the potential for this product?

0:02:33	SPEAKER_00
 Are we able to achieve this our net profit or our aim?

0:02:38	SPEAKER_03
 Then...

0:02:45	SPEAKER_00
 Press F5 to start.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_00
 Then the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_00
 A detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_00
 But they prefer, but they not prefer, but what problems they do encounter in all these types of things.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_00
 And what we got first, we found that...

0:03:15	SPEAKER_00
 But they...

0:03:16	SPEAKER_00
 What problems they are having with the grant remote controls available in the market?

0:03:22	SPEAKER_00
 75% of users, they find that the remote controls available in the market are ugly.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_00
 They are not so good looking.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to put stress on this.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_00
 We have to take care of this factor also like our design should be appropriate, should be good looking for the consumers.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_00
 And yes, this will definitely...

0:03:44	SPEAKER_00
 This can definitely put in house our sales.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_00
 And even the good thing about this is that 80% of users, they are willing to pay more for this good looking remote controls also.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_00
 So even if the available market cost for the available remote control is less, even then we can sell it at 25 euros, which may seem quite high.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_00
 But if our looks are...

0:04:14	SPEAKER_00
 If the remote control we design have a better look, better designs, then we can hope that consumers will prefer these remote controls.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_00
 And the second thing, some companies think that they should have more and more functions of the users in their remote controls.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_00
 But rather than those having more functions in the remote controls, we should emphasize what actually consumers want, what they operate, rather than making it too complicated.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_00
 Because mostly it has been found that 50% of the users, they use only 10% of the buttons.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_00
 So there is no fund of having 90% buttons making the remote controls too bulky, too complicated, too expensive.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_00
 And because I think I believe that technologies use will only if the consumers they want to use it.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_00
 Otherwise there is no fund of having all this type of thing.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_00
 So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls, but it will increase our profit also.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to take care of this factor also.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_00
 It was function I want to go.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, you are going to go back just to escape.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_00
 Then if we look at this slide, these are your shared documents.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_00
 You can see.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_01
 I was just going to say what was the question for us.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_01
 Are you coming onto that?

0:05:49	SPEAKER_00
 Look at the market potential.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_00
 But how we should design our remote controls, what it should be there.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_00
 So as to enhance our profit.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_00
 So these are different age group persons.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_00
 Like sorry, I can open it in another way.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_03
 Speechwork here.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_00
 If we look at the cost, whether the consumers they are willing to pay more for speech recognition in their remote control or not, we can find that the up to a 35 year age group, we have a very good disliking for this point like for speech recognition in their remote control.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_00
 So we can emphasize on this point also.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_00
 Because it will definitely enhance our sales in this particular age group from 15 to 35.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_00
 And I think that most of the users of the TV are belong to this age group.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_00
 So we should look at who buys it as well.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we can look at that factor also.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_03
 Which other 25 to 35 is usually.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_00
 And...

0:07:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_00
 If we look at this data, how what are the problems because the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market?

0:07:25	SPEAKER_00
 They find that 35% of the consumers find too difficult to operate in remote control.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_00
 So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_00
 And we should provide proper manuals, files, use also.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_00
 So as that consumers could easily learn and need not to have any much technical knowledge to see to know how to operate these remote controls.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_00
 So this is also a very major factor to take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_00
 So this is all about market potential by me.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, thank you.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, that's cool.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, so we do.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if the cable's going to be long.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_01
 I just can't get over whatever runs or underneath.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, and then what do I press F8?

0:08:46	SPEAKER_00
 F8.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_01
 Function F8.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, cool.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_00
 It's not coming up.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_00
 Function F8, again.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, no signal.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_00
 There you go.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_00
 Computer.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, and then how do I press the big one to get it off to the F5?

0:09:18	SPEAKER_01
 F5, and I press that again to get it all.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_03
 F5, and the cable bring it back and just the left button for advancing.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so I'm the interface designer user interface designer.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_01
 I'm concerned with what effect the operator should have on the user.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_01
 I'm also, I want to point out that our motto put the fashion in electronics.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_01
 And then we're going to make a product that's trendy and fashionable.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 And how do I press the next button?

0:10:01	SPEAKER_01
 Just a left there.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_01
 So I looked at existing designs and also the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like, what people dislike.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_01
 What people fashionable because we said people between 25 and 35 were the main buyers of our TV, I think.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_01
 So what they like and what they find fashionable and ergonomics research.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know, I haven't actually been able to do any of this myself, but maybe that comes up, I don't know.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_01
 And the findings, well, that was a basic function, send messages to the television set.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_01
 That's what people want to do.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_01
 So they need to be included.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_01
 But I've got some pictures here of some leading ones.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know how to get some.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_03
 If you're a scape, then you can see your bar.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, okay, cool.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_01
 I've got the glasses.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_01
 I hope it fits.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_01
 These are two leading remote controls at the moment.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_01
 You know, they're gray.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, this one's got loads of buttons.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_01
 It's hard to tell from here what they actually do.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_01
 And they're doing very exciting at all.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_01
 Personally, I prefer this one just because it's no easier to use.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_01
 It's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_01
 But there you go.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_01
 I think we can do much better than that.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_01
 I hope so.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_01
 Hang on.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_01
 F5.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, sorry.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_01
 Personal preferences.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think we need to, I think the ergonomics is quite important.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_03
 Particularly, yeah.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_03
 There was a bit in the RSI and things as well.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_01
 And I thought not too edgy and like a box, more kind of handheld, more.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_01
 Not as a computer and organic.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_01
 Organic, yeah, more organic shape, I think.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_01
 Simple designs.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_01
 Like the last one we just saw, not too many buttons.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_01
 And as a Raj point out, only 10%, 50% of people only use 10% of the buttons.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_01
 So I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and how nice it is.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_01
 Handheld and portable, I think, is important.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_01
 Because TFT have just released, I think, is it a remote control for presentations or a big screen?

0:12:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, not so many, anyway.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_01
 So handheld and portable.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_01
 I thought about other functions for TV, but as you pointed out, people don't actually want that.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_03
 And also the company wants to keep it stuck to the TV for, to keep them stuck to the TV.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 It's the one TV.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_01
 And so the last thing I thought, which I quickly mentioned in the other one, was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people, like blowing the dark.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_01
 Which does already exist, but it's not very widely used.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think easy finder with a whistle function or something or rechargeable station because it's pain when you run out of batteries.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_01
 And I think that, yeah, that's it.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_02
 So I noticed we talked about speech recognition and whistling.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_02
 And I just curious now, have we done any research on how many people can whistle?

0:13:57	SPEAKER_02
 Or is that a function we want in the remote?

0:14:01	SPEAKER_02
 Do you have trouble whistling?

0:14:03	SPEAKER_02
 I don't, but I know a lot of people do, really?

0:14:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it just, I mean, it has to be a certain kind of whistling, too.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's whistling, too.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_03
 So you could have the, you could have the basically instead of a whistle, if it's got the voice recognition, you could have it just, you know, where are you?

0:14:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's costly though.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_02
 Much easier thing is just any loud noise, like clapping, shouting, you know, that's good.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_02
 And then would the response be a beep's back, or something?

0:14:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, something.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I said this up, so plug it in, press F5, function F5, function F8 for the function F8.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_01
 I need to twit on the thing, you got to think?

0:14:53	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's just lacking in.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_02
 It's good.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:15:00	None
 Yeah.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_02
 So as the industrial designer, my job is to take an input from you guys.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_02
 So it's good you went first.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_02
 And I shot it down some notes as to what are the needs.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_02
 And what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_02
 So Raj told us that consumers are going to spend more for fancy products.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_02
 And we also mentioned that the current products don't always match users operating behavior.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_02
 A lot of the buttons aren't used.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_02
 And mention that they're not fun to use.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_02
 And a novel feature, which you just brought up with this automatic speech recognition feature, or noise detection feature for when you lose your remote, there could be a little microphone on it.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_02
 And any noise over a certain threshold, it'll pick up as a distress signal from you.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_02
 And I'll beep back and say, no, here I am.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_03
 Sure, surely that would have to be sort of specific, rather, above a threshold.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_03
 Because if you had a live movie on you, likely you could get it back at you.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_02
 Well, maybe you could have a...

0:16:27	SPEAKER_02
 That would be a consideration to take into account this.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry, didn't mean to do really either.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, well, that's for later down the road.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_02
 And then as for the user interface, it should be trendy.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_02
 I am not computer-y.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_02
 So more low tech.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_02
 And not too many buttons.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_02
 So I took these onto consideration.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_02
 And also I have some limitations from the boss.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_02
 And practical limitations, which I kind of threw out the window.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_02
 And so I did a little research.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_02
 And unfortunately, all I had to work on was our corporate archives of the great products we've made before, which include spacecraft, coffee makers, and boat trains.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, is that what they're...

0:17:21	SPEAKER_02
 Or high speed trains.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_02
 Right, and having personally worked with all these products, I have a great deal of experience with the industrial design.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_03
 If you can build spacecraft, you'll have no problem with our control.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_02
 So I figured, just put them all together.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_02
 We had a caffeine-powered space shuttle train transport to your TV.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_02
 And as for the user interface problem, too many buttons.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_02
 Give it one button.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_02
 And it's for the cowboy and all of us.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not quite sure what the function is there.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I like that design.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, you could have a...

0:18:08	SPEAKER_03
 Is that just switches on the speed recognition that it's entirely speech-operated?

0:18:12	SPEAKER_02
 So I think I missed the budget thing.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_02
 It was 15 million euros.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_02
 And we got a sold 25 of them.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_01
 Not a problem.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_03
 OK, no, it's after 9 euros.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_03
 We've got a...

0:18:24	SPEAKER_03
 We've got a profit.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_03
 We've got a profit.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_03
 So we're making that at 12.5 euros a time.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I guess more realistically than.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_02
 We need a product that's got some kind of nifty outer casing, cheap plastic.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_02
 That should be just like a 10 to the price maybe or less.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_02
 An energy source, which would probably just be your regular batteries.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_03
 Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea?

0:18:51	SPEAKER_02
 It's like a little bit stationary.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we could do that too.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_02
 I hadn't thought of that.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_01
 That might cost more though, because obviously with batteries, we don't need to provide...

0:19:02	SPEAKER_01
 Or we provide the first batteries, but...

0:19:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_01
 It's more...

0:19:06	SPEAKER_01
 It does cheaper.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, if you think about these base stations though, it's essentially just a lead with a...

0:19:11	SPEAKER_03
 Self-connecting brake.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:19:14	SPEAKER_03
 Right, I don't think I'd be able to...

0:19:16	SPEAKER_02
 I'll price that one.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_02
 The user interface, the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_02
 But since we're a cutting-edge company, we of course will have alternatives.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_02
 Like speech recognition, whistling recognition, then rocket power.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_02
 And lastly, the transmission interface is just some engineering thing.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_02
 You don't have to worry about that.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_02
 So here's a great schematic that my apprentice designer gave me.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_02
 As you can see, the remote control have parts and those parts, like that.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_02
 And, you know, it's got a...

0:19:59	SPEAKER_02
 Well, operating procedure.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_02
 It looks something like that.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_02
 And I suppose you all know how it works, because we've all used it.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_02
 And we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_02
 Personal preferences, I think, programmable options, which just require a small amount of memory, non-volatile memory, just...

0:20:25	SPEAKER_02
 So the user can put in their favorite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings that would turn it on.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_02
 It's not blasting.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_01
 That's a good idea, actually.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_01
 I like the performance of the options.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you do.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_02
 And the bells and whistles that we mentioned, you know, take more budgeting, more technical expenditure of effort.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_02
 And it's also much more likely to not work if we add these bells and whistles.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_03
 So I got...

0:20:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, thank you so much.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_03
 I'll take that back.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_03
 Right, also, so, you know what I said, got not very long before we think so.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_03
 Didn't manage to forward it onto you, is...

0:21:12	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just going to say I'll find it for some...

0:21:22	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I think it needs to go in there.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_02
 Just...

0:21:32	SPEAKER_03
 We had that to disinclute telltext because it's become outdated, nobody uses it in any way.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_03
 Oracle would have to say with that, but no, but...

0:21:47	SPEAKER_03
 It's only for the television, which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_03
 And instead of colors and...

0:21:56	SPEAKER_03
 sort of color options, they want corporate color and slogan somehow implemented a new design.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_01
 Corporate color.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yellow.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_03
 I presume.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_03
 Everything, all this sort of, you know, the corporate website and everything's yellow.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_03
 And the local...

0:22:21	SPEAKER_03
 So it's Logan, we put the fashion and electronics.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know exactly how to incorporate...

0:22:31	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape, you could kind of have it working as way around it or something.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_03
 Where are my...

0:22:43	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_03
 So we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_03
 Now, we had, as listed options, we had speech recognition, potentially, flat screen interface, LCD interface.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_03
 We also want to limit their number of buttons.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_03
 So we'll pretty much take that one as red.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_03
 We'll use the basic functions for our television.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_03
 No teletext.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_01
 Although the danger with that is it could look a bit cheap.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_03
 Not enough buttons, you mean the hair.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_03
 Well...

0:23:30	SPEAKER_03
 So it's a striker balance between a few and a...

0:23:32	SPEAKER_03
 Or it looks like we're just cutting on the...

0:23:35	SPEAKER_01
 On number of buttons, can I...

0:23:37	SPEAKER_03
 I do, however, have this from over my head.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_03
 They don't want teletext on it.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, cool.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe, Raj, you could find out what people would think about that on the little thing.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_03
 About the...

0:23:52	SPEAKER_03
 What people...

0:23:53	SPEAKER_03
 Other people would require teletext.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_03
 In the teletext option, in the remote control.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_03
 Attached.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_03
 So I take it your position now, always, that...

0:24:10	SPEAKER_03
 The bells and whistles we've got to come up with a gimmick, but not too complicated to gimmick it.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:24:19	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, the sort of inkling I'm getting from a little bit of web chanel I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a TFT display, interactive display.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_03
 However, that does say in a bit like the...

0:24:34	SPEAKER_03
 More complicated design that Raj...

0:24:37	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry, Raj.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_03
 I said people didn't like it.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_03
 Although, I guess, if there's a sort of thing about standard interfaces that people use already, sort of windows style, drop down menus, or whatever, I think maybe that's a bit...

0:24:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_03
 Going a bit far, but, you know, like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons, and if you hit that sort of menu at the top, you have...

0:25:06	SPEAKER_03
 It goes to a different selection of buttons, so it keeps it simple.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_03
 Going the dark, is that sort of with a light inside it, or is it...

0:25:16	SPEAKER_03
 Going the dark material.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_01
 Going the dark material, and I was thinking.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:25:21	SPEAKER_01
 I guess that would be cheap kind of.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_00
 I'll be able to see something about this.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's really, really very important point, is if we look at the market, because people, 50% people, they find that the mode controls are often lost somewhere in the room.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_00
 In the room.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_00
 But from last.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, are lost.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_00
 And means they forget where they have kept the mode control last time.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_00
 But if we add speech recognition, as well as glowing the dark, and both these factors will help them locating their mode control.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_00
 Like, if they come and speak something, and the mode control replies to something, something, and it glows in the dark.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_00
 Both these factors, both these points will help them to locate where they have kept this remote control.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_00
 And this will definitely enhance our market sales.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_00
 So we should take it into consideration also.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:26:16	SPEAKER_03
 Speech recognition.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_03
 Take it.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_03
 I don't have no products.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_03
 There was a much...

0:26:24	SPEAKER_02
 There was a much...

0:26:25	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that cannot two years ago, they had some basic speech recognition on it.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_02
 You could program it with your channels, and then say, you know, the BBC One, and it goes to that channel.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it didn't work very well though, because of this noise and interference problem.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_02
 They mentioned, you know, if the television says you are listening to the BBC One.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_03
 Or, yeah, an advert for BBC Two or the BBC One will switch the channel for you, kind of.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_02
 Right, right.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_02
 And so there's a lot of this.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_02
 You'd be watching the TV and then all of a sudden it pick up a noise and turn it off, or turn the volume off or something.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_02
 But if you can work around that noise problem.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_01
 Well, what about this might get a big too expensive actually, but what about something was built into the TV that you can press and it'll send out a little signal.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_01
 You know, like the ones that we can't hear.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_01
 Or something.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know, you can do that, yeah.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_01
 That will activate the remote control start to beat.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_03
 So like I kind of backwards remote control.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_02
 And then I do just, you know, subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_02
 Well, you could do then would be you have a remote control by the TV speaker.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_02
 Or not remote, I'm sorry, a microphone by the TV speaker and the transmitter there.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_02
 It sends back to your mode because you can't expect the television manufacturers to put that feature into the device.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's the only thing.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, then you have like a little separate module by the TV stick.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_01
 That comes with our remote control.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_02
 And then the remote control will know what's being produced by the TV.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_03
 And then the speaker will be the speaker.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's certainly possible.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_02
 And another thing is about this losing your mode and trying to find it again.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_02
 If you do have this sort of speech interface to it, you don't even need to find it.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_02
 You just say, you know, whatever you want the remote for, you know, to change a channel.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_02
 Or to turn the TV on and off.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_02
 You just shout your command to it and do it for you.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_02
 If it's within, you know, within hearing range.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_02
 And I, you know, could be somewhere in the room, you know, if no idea where it is.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_02
 And it still does jump.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_02
 That could also be built into the TV.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_01
 There is might make our network a bit obsolete.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_03
 Hopefully we'll do it as a joke or head up the earth.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_03
 I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_03
 So I think rather than, and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference and not working very well and things are there.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_03
 And the expense of the time.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_03
 So I think if we're going to go well, I mean, like to think about the problem with the TFT or the LCD kind of thing is if you're also wanting the kind of.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_03
 Organic globbies are feeling to it.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_03
 Then you might have trouble incorporating screen.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_03
 But I guess not.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_03
 I just pretend that's not the problem.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_03
 And how are you about the blue and the dark and the old?

0:29:41	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe not even all of it because we said colors and fashion were important. So maybe just like a little line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_02
 The materials cheap, but it's just the the ground and the dark material needs some light to charge it.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_03
 If you're sitting in the dark for too long or if it's done under the coach cushions.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_03
 We're using the same mind.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, well, we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because what I thought maybe we're going to have to we're going to have a logo on as well.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_03
 Bright yellow logo in a.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_03
 It's looking.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_03
 Then, you know, they're going to be fairly bright and colored anyway.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_03
 And you can have sort of a trimming as well.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_01
 And then you can have a dark and the dark and the dark.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that more than finding it that was more like you know, if you're watching a film in the dark.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_01
 You can still see the red.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_03
 That was more of a.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_03
 If we're going to go with the idea of a feedback.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_03
 The more finder then that kind of stuff.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_03
 It makes it fairly unnecessary.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so we've got do we want to go with the TFT idea.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_03
 Is there a getting.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I think I think they're sort of find the finder things.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, it's a good pull.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_02
 We're right.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_02
 I think a consideration to is that these are remote get abused a lot.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_02
 You know, you get thrown around.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_02
 There's a good chance that the TFT screen would break or get damaged.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_02
 They're pretty fragile.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_01
 So is that one of our definite requirements that they were.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_03
 And no, I mean, we were not was going on rough.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_03
 I just sort of.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_03
 Marking research, I guess.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_03
 And.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_03
 So stick with sort of programmability.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_03
 For the buttons that we do have.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_03
 And.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_03
 So that's sort of included in your sub module kind of stuff.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_03
 You're finding out by tell text.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_03
 If you could find that.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_00
 Speed to go.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_03
 I think we're going to scratch the speech recognition is a bit of a.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_03
 Expensive.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, it's much cheaper than TFT.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_02
 It's just a mic.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_02
 Some integrated circuits.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_02
 It'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that kind of takes back the RF.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_03
 The RF remote sort of ideas.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_03
 Um.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_03
 Five minutes.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_03
 Decisions.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_03
 Folks.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_03
 It's vote.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_03
 Who wants TFT?

0:33:11	SPEAKER_03
 No one does.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_03
 Excellent.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_03
 So we've got with speech recognition.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_03
 The speech recognition limited buttons, organic design.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_03
 And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down enough.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_03
 I've fallen at my head.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_03
 Program ability.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_00
 Glow in dark.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_01
 If it's not a text message, I think it's good to get it.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_03
 And also integrating the member to integrate the logo and the slogan.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_03
 So, um, can you put all these reports in the project documents folder?

0:33:50	SPEAKER_03
 If not already in there as well.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_03
 So it just helps me.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_03
 Some where I say here.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_03
 And, um, I'll put anything I'm putting anything I do in there anyway.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_03
 So, uh.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_01
 And where is it?

0:34:03	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_03
 Project documents.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_03
 On.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_02
 So it should be when you say my scenario controller.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_02
 I had desktop.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_02
 So I'm going to say that.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_00
 Oh.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_00
 Is it in shared document?

0:34:16	SPEAKER_02
 And then, uh, with that little folder up thing.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_03
 Um, I'll put your project documents here.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_03
 It's on your desktop.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_04
 So I'll put that.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_02
 That's desktop.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_02
 That's the project documents.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_02
 I can't.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_02
 Hmm.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_00
 It just won't give me anything.

0:34:35	None
 Just that.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_03
 And I'm getting strings of, uh, information.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_03
 I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular, as soon as I get them out of them.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_03
 I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_03
 And then meeting turned up.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_02
 Did you get my email?

0:34:57	SPEAKER_02
 I did.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_01
 What I thought was about the material is, um, maybe not this kind of material, maybe more like, um, this kind of rubbering materials, a bit more bouncy.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_01
 Like he said, they get chucked around a lot.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_01
 Um, a bit more durable.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_01
 And that can also be ergonomic.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_01
 And it kind of feels a bit different from all other American trials.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_01
 The REPA.

0:35:39	SPEAKER_03
 More surf.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_03
 Um, flash like the plastic.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_04
 Mm hmm.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_04
 Wow.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_00
 But we have to take care of it.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_00
 But we have to take care about children also.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_00
 And that means if children catch out of here, if they choose, it shouldn't be too harmful.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_00
 So whatever material we use.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, no.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_00
 It's funny.

0:36:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_00
 We have to safety point of view also.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_00
 We have to take care.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_01
 I think with, with the more organic shape, it won't be as, what is it, how many sharp corners is that?

0:36:18	SPEAKER_01
 So that's something good.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_01
 Um, I don't know.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_01
 Oh my god, it smells good for children.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_02
 We have to fleece out of the box and make the thing, a big red ball, foam ball.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_02
 So I think they need some.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_02
 There's no buttons at all.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_02
 It's always on and just yell at it.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_01
 That's a good idea.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:39	SPEAKER_03
 Chosen up.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_03
 It's going to be a big yellow.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yellow.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_01
 With the color, does it have to be all yellow?

0:36:47	SPEAKER_03
 Please God, no.

0:36:49	SPEAKER_03
 Um, well, I wouldn't, I mean, the reaction to an all yellow and what control wouldn't be anything other than horror.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_03
 So I think just having it.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_00
 Small yellow.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_00
 It's a red in a logo.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_00
 It's small yellow strip or yellow square.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_00
 Is it a logo in it?

0:37:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:06	None
 Okay.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, I'll see if I can argue with the boss about putting the, what is it?

0:37:12	SPEAKER_03
 We put, we put the fashion into, oops, I'm not working.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_03
 I can't believe I forgot the wrong, you put the fashion into electronics.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah, it's a good one though.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_03
 I bet that'll catch on a while.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, any last.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_03
 Where are you speedy?

0:37:33	SPEAKER_03
 Top 30.

0:37:34	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_02
 It's the last one.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry.

0:37:39	SPEAKER_03
 I know what you're thinking.

0:37:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, that's lunchtime.

0:37:45	SPEAKER_00
 That's great.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, that felt a bit more like something that you're the older and the reason to it than the last one.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_03
 It's quite fun actually.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_01
 Wow.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_01
 Does anybody press the K?

0:38:01	SPEAKER_01
 It's my break.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_01
 Pretty cool.

0:38:05	SPEAKER_03
 Why are you for the very first page?

0:38:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I was just writing on the page.

0:38:09	SPEAKER_02
 I've got more, I think.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I've been using up pages.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_01
 I don't want to wait for it.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_03
 Finish the meeting now.
