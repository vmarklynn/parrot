0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 So, yeah, we put this stuff on so that we have some record of the whole thing, but this is the VIA I'm going to say.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_01
 The whole idea here is, let's also put the lap alone.

0:00:21	SPEAKER_01
 So, the whole idea of this meeting is that it's not me who will be talking about it.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_01
 So, what if it would be a boring meeting?

0:00:31	SPEAKER_01
 So, Joao is going to talk.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to listen.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_01
 So, actually, the reason why we got together is that it's about the time to make sure that when that leaves us, I'm afraid it may happen right.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, although it didn't change our mind yet.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_01
 I couldn't.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_01
 All your girlfriend didn't mind.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_01
 I would like to change, but I can.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_01
 So that whatever he's been doing is not forgotten and then people can stay on the shoulders and hope that he won't get out entirely out of this problem, but still we need to continue on this.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_01
 So I think the Joao will be my main hope that he's going to pick up the keyword spotting and some of these ideas.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_01
 And also, the reason why Thicha Motli check is here is that Joao is also getting interested in open models of the temple and the wall.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_01
 And of course, better for signals.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_01
 So, there's about it.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_01
 I think you should do more.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_01
 I'm more than you know.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_01
 But you will be here.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_01
 And from a different point of view, Thicha is working mainly on speech coding.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_01
 So, I guess that really you should be talking more than anybody else because you should be asking questions.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, right.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_01
 So, what do you need to know?

0:01:51	SPEAKER_04
 Let me just tell us what you know already about how far you are with this.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it's features.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_02
 So, basically I started reading about the features that's taking the long temporal and time frame, that's traps and tandem approach.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_04
 So, you know, yeah.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_02
 So, then also started with there was a paper on fitting an air model to the DCT of Sigma model.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_02
 Started with that and slowly getting used to those stuff.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_03
 To the DCT?

0:02:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_03
 But, I think it's really good to know.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's a paper by Danielis and Co.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, this is how it started.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_01
 Because that was Mario Satineos.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_01
 And then Alice.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_01
 They had a paper, I believe it was not.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_01
 ASRU was a sign.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_01
 2003.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_01
 But that was the time when they were using very long segments.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_01
 It was like 50 minutes ago or something when they were playing with the time.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_01
 So then, the story was that then Mario's presented that itself some meeting and we realized, oh, that might be cute, sing for estimating spectral energies because that's what we want.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_01
 And the way we are doing it is, I think it works, but it's a little bit elegant.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_01
 Somehow stupid to first do the frame based estimate and then you get stick to 100 hertz sampling, 10 millisecond sampling or something.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_01
 And then you just pick up the trajectory.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_01
 So Mario's was here for half a year or maybe or even more and started working better.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_01
 So just kind so they were working a little bit together, and Mario was programming in MATLAB and he was putting it in the process.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I just rewrote it in the C++, I didn't do too much on that.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_01
 And then we were hoping to pick up on that a little bit more and we did, right?

0:03:56	SPEAKER_01
 You did a little bit of work.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we tried many noobstitune on that because you can decide what compression factor and everything, so I tried a little bit like maybe three noobs and tried to go through the 3D cage to see what happens in which kind of settings.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_03
 So this we did.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_03
 And we never published that anyway, right?

0:04:20	SPEAKER_03
 We didn't because there was still the question that I don't remember right now because there was some essential question.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_03
 I don't remember.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_03
 I would have to look at it.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_03
 And because before we could write anything, I would have to be sure that something is right there.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_03
 I couldn't be sure about it at the time.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_03
 And anyway, it takes time.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_03
 This computation is very inefficient.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_03
 It takes like 100 times more than computing some MFCC is computing these features because it's a huge DCT, huge FFT everywhere.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_01
 If you're also doing a silly thing that we were stepping it by 10 milliseconds, right?

0:05:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, there is no optimization.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_03
 We just stick to the trap.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_03
 We wanted to make as close to trap as possible, which is silly, but that you have to start

0:05:10	SPEAKER_02
 somewhere. Yeah.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_02
 So then I continued with another paper that you're mentioning in a free trap.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_02
 So just moving around with that idea.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_02
 And also the main idea today why I told me is like if you can list down what all things are there to be taken care of, then one by one, because finally if I find that you have something else, maybe to list down the things other than what I've already taken from you.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_02
 And also to discuss generally.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_03
 So, well, last time we were talking about the Gaussians, you have the Gaussians running somehow, like feature extraction.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, feature extraction.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_03
 The random training.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_03
 And also.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_03
 So you're able to train the net now.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_01
 You may be the only one in the whole world now, because Chiffang is gone and Barry is gone.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_01
 So Morgan was joined.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_01
 They're gone from Xe.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_01
 No, they are gone from Xe.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, Chiffang went to TI and Barry is at Lawrence River Mall app.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_01
 He basically got a job.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_01
 He graduated.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_01
 He'll be working on things which he cannot talk about.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_01
 You can't even say you're on a microphone here.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, it's classified.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_01
 Work quickly.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_01
 And so Morgan was only half joking.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_01
 Somebody was asking him something.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, there was a, there was a Matthew.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_01
 And he said, well, probably we'll be coming to ask you because nobody really knows.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_01
 So please take.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_03
 Who is the one who is now developing the quick net in these things?

0:06:44	SPEAKER_03
 The MLP4 and these things.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_01
 Nobody.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_01
 That was Barry.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_01
 It was Barry?

0:06:50	SPEAKER_01
 Actually, Berno is doing a lot of that.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_01
 Now they picked up the software and they play with this full layer of nets.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_01
 So they might be that Berno will be a soon, ultimate expert on it.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_03
 Well, still we have the experts who made the software run here.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_03
 You know, Olivier, which software?

0:07:08	SPEAKER_01
 No, quick net training.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the internet itself was done actually long time ago.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, but Olivier, make it run on these machines and make the, across the, across the, across the 2G barrier here at the DIA because we couldn't, we couldn't do something.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know what, but he is, he is now good in quick net.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so I guess that's to treat him well.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah, I, so I have the feature extraction part where I can get the phoneme posterior to generate through the neural net.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_03
 So then I think you just missed the backend, which is easy because it's HDK.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_03
 It's everyone knows.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah, it's taken through for some other task I've run it's taken.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_02
 So, okay.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_02
 I have the general field, but maybe I can take the entire setup from you and run it once on my, this thing to have.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_03
 And you, you just need from us to hear what are the other front ends and other features to choose something.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, basically.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_02
 So then I think I can share what I have read down.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the whole idea then is that you start playing with it, right?

0:08:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_03
 So how do we do it?

0:08:21	SPEAKER_01
 Should I list it or?

0:08:23	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe that might be the, but still the feature extraction that we have already taken then the backend for that.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_03
 Then, well, yeah.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_03
 Like I, I, I distinguish between feature extraction and then the MLP because you feed something to the MLP, which are not the waves.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_03
 So, so well, that's, that's what I call it.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_03
 And then the backend.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_03
 But okay.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_03
 Also, what I have here, what I've been working on since I was here was MFCCPLP, which is always needed for comparison purposes and traps with warriors lands.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_03
 And also, you know, traps.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_03
 Traps, I know, but with various, various lands.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_03
 So, we were trying to start from, from the ultimate lands of one, one frame, up to one second or even more, but it was, so this also, then we applied the DCT on the trap itself, which is some, something like the goshions, applying some, filtering basically the trap.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_03
 So this, but this is mainly a franta who was doing this.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_03
 So, this is related traps.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_03
 I was also trying the warping.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_03
 Means if you have a second, which is 101 samples, I was just keeping the central 10 samples and then I was throwing away some, some of them, you know, like resampling this, this one second of the trap to something which I, which I preserved all the points in the center and just picked every 10 points at the boundaries, which means the trap, 101 trap trajectory shrink to say 15 points with still preserving the maximum resolution at the center and throwing away most of the points near the boundary.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_03
 So this I was trying to, this I have some results on.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_03
 So these are traps, then the gosh traps.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_03
 So, um, Tandem system, the Tandem you plus minus half because that's, that's just a PLPS and then there is a training with MLP, which taking some context of these PLP coefficients.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_03
 So it's like feeding PL, PLP or MSC, whatever to MLP and taking some context.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_03
 This is the Tandem.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_03
 So this setup we also have here.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't experiment with this, but maybe some more results.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_03
 It's Hammond who has the results on Tandem I guess.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_01
 You still have before you lost all of this.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I think the most important results are already in the TCC's writing.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_03
 So is there somewhere?

0:11:21	SPEAKER_03
 So this is Tandem.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_03
 Uh, then, then what, and then there is the FTLP, then we can talk more about it.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_03
 Which is, which I have more experiments on.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_03
 Also this warping and compression and all these things.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_02
 So compression basically you are looking at.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but I'm using that for different, different reason, right?

0:11:49	SPEAKER_04
 So it's a speech coning.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_04
 So what is the task is you should just take the speech, of course, somehow to encode it into as small number of bits as possible and with the reason of the quality of course.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_04
 And again, to decode it.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_04
 And I'm using FDLP for that.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_04
 Still playing with more as one second long segment.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_04
 So just dividing the speech into one second frames, doing DCT.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_04
 It's just the standard work and then doing some compression and computation.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_04
 So subbands, no.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_04
 But you are doing the same, no?

0:12:30	SPEAKER_04
 Well, yeah.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_03
 But you just didn't talk about it.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_04
 You take the DCT and you just divide it into several subbands, frequency bands with the different.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_03
 And by the way, you don't do the overlap on the subbands, no?

0:12:43	SPEAKER_03
 You do?

0:12:44	SPEAKER_03
 I do.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but you don't do the overlap on the time domain?

0:12:48	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no, no, I don't do.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_02
 So that's the difference.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_02
 For compression, you're basically doing it.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, just one second without overlapping.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_04
 But in frequency domain, there is overlap because you can choose which filters you want or just trajectories of those bands.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_04
 So there is overlapping.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_04
 I'm using those Gaussian filters or classical, those trapezoidal, like in MSCCs, right?

0:13:15	SPEAKER_00
 And then processing each.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, PIL.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, PIL.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, trangolors.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, trangolors, that one.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_04
 Then I'm doing independent processing of each frequency band.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_04
 So I'm computing that Hilbert envelope, which is just the envelope of some temporal trajectory.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_04
 And more or less, you can divide this into a Hilbert envelope.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_04
 Hilbert carrier, which is something like LP, linear prediction envelope, out-to-risk model, and excitation signal.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, so those are two parts or items you need somehow to encode.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_04
 If you want, again, to get original speech or reasonable quality.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_04
 And there is some compression factor, which is, again, when you're computing that after aggressive model from FDLP, you can compress the spectrum somehow in such a way that you rather preserve those, even also those dips, not only peaks in the spectrum.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_04
 And it sounds better for some kind of...

0:14:22	SPEAKER_03
 You know about this compression, how easy it is, why it's...

0:14:25	SPEAKER_01
 I just don't know.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 It's more than I do.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_03
 But he's new, he's doing more so the same.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_04
 So it's kind of a logarithm when you use logarithm for MSCCs, right?

0:14:37	SPEAKER_04
 So it's, again, a compression factor, something like that.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_04
 But then you have to uncompress it, again, of course, to get back the speech.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_04
 And there are other other things which I'm doing, but it's not related to speech recognition so much.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_01
 And certainly when it comes to the op-on modeling of temporal trajectories, even if a phone tag is not here, you probably know a lot about it by now.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_01
 Well, what?

0:15:05	SPEAKER_01
 Now, approximating the data by op-on model.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_03
 FDLP.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if you are not here, the best of what you take.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_01
 Sure, I know.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it's more or less the same approach, right?

0:15:19	SPEAKER_01
 There is a different application.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, right.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_01
 Different software or something.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_03
 So, just in the speech, recenters is coding what you're doing.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_03
 Did you try to play with the knob somewhere?

0:15:35	SPEAKER_03
 With what?

0:15:36	SPEAKER_03
 With, I don't know, the compression number of bands and...

0:15:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sure.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_03
 Number of bands and...

0:15:44	SPEAKER_03
 What you were playing with and what are the results?

0:15:47	SPEAKER_03
 Like what to use?

0:15:48	SPEAKER_03
 You know, there's the problem for speech-learning.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_04
 Because I don't have results like in speech recognition.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, of course, you listen to it yourself.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_03
 I'm fine with that.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_04
 Well, so now what I'm using are 15 bands, which seems to me...

0:16:02	SPEAKER_04
 15 frequency bands, which seems to me quite reasonable.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_04
 We can go down till like 12 and still okay, I would say.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_04
 But then you start hearing different...

0:16:11	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_04
 Or also, that's another problem.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_04
 Once you can go down with frequency bands, then you will have much more complicated that, let's say, oxidation signal or that carrier which...

0:16:22	SPEAKER_04
 If you go down?

0:16:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because...

0:16:24	SPEAKER_01
 If you make a broader band.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_01
 A broader band, right.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_01
 Because when the band is narrow, the excitation is close, the carrier is close to sinusoid.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_01
 Basically, it also means...

0:16:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it might be like that.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_04
 So there is more and more frequency components, let's say, in one process.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_03
 So you want to say that the LPC is not able to fit it so that the residual was...

0:16:43	SPEAKER_04
 No, LPC will maybe.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_04
 But then you have still an airport, something like a source and a filter.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_04
 So when you are doing speech-cooling...

0:16:54	SPEAKER_01
 You may almost want to...

0:16:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_01
 It's a wide board.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_01
 For this here, right?

0:16:59	SPEAKER_01
 What?

0:17:00	SPEAKER_02
 So can we remove this when you are going to this place?

0:17:06	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think so.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think so.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_03
 No, you are not supposed to.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_04
 No, yeah.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, it's the same like when you are doing LPC in tases, right?

0:17:14	SPEAKER_04
 So you've got source signal.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know, source.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_03
 I think you have to push it as much as possible because it reacts to the...

0:17:23	SPEAKER_04
 And then there is some filter which is that one divided by az.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_04
 And that's it.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_04
 And the source can be a noise signal or it can be some sequence of...

0:17:36	SPEAKER_04
 What is that?

0:17:37	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, see, this is a standard time domain.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_04
 So it's more or less the same what I'm doing.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_04
 So this is some envelope which is in our case related to Hilbert envelope.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_04
 And this is a source signal which is Hilbert carrier.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_01
 But since you are in the different domain, this is here you are in time domain, right?

0:17:58	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_01
 But where you are, you are really in a frequency domain.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_01
 So the line stands into science, right?

0:18:05	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_01
 And you can see exactly.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_01
 So this is now going to be progressing.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_01
 Because this spectrum is also line spectrum, right?

0:18:14	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, all components.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_01
 So if you are in a frequency, your source looks like this.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_04
 So more or less, we can plot it.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_04
 So what we can see is some Hilbert envelope like this.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_04
 And then there is that Hilbert carrier.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_04
 Or this is not Hilbert carrier, but this is the signal which we get from one frequency band.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_04
 So you compute dCT, right?

0:18:37	SPEAKER_03
 This is the sub band.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah, exactly.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_04
 Time signal.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_04
 And what we get from that is this Hilbert envelope, right?

0:18:43	SPEAKER_04
 So you know that.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_04
 And the second which should be that carrier should be something like this.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_04
 So it's really close to cosine.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_04
 We might see.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_04
 Do it properly, right?

0:18:53	SPEAKER_04
 And this is what you also have to somewhat transmit or at this try to transmit in order to get it.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_03
 And this is why.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_03
 I was thinking the residual in LPC fit of the Hilbert envelope.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_03
 Not this.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_03
 I was not thinking of this at all before.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_03
 Because there are three things.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_03
 First you have to encode this, then the LPC coefficients and the residual after LPC.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_03
 No, I don't need LPC.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_02
 I don't have to do it for him.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_02
 This is a residual for me.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_02
 For the residual.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I just want to transmit this signal, right?

0:19:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_04
 And what you need is this envelope and this one carrier.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_04
 And you again get the same signal, this shape.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_04
 Do it.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_01
 IDCT.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_01
 And the biggest problem currently is that the carrier is actually not cosine but the same little bit more.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_04
 Take a look.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_04
 If you have a very good music signal which is very periodic, you can really see something like there is one peak.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_01
 If the frequency doesn't change over the...

0:19:54	SPEAKER_04
 And frequency more or doesn't change.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_04
 It's related to that frequency of the broadband.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_04
 It's good.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_04
 If you have those filters which are wider and wider, this is that center frequency which is somehow related to this one.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_03
 And so...

0:20:12	SPEAKER_03
 So the broader bands do what on this picture?

0:20:16	SPEAKER_03
 It's worse and worse.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_04
 Then you don't see anything like cosine.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_01
 Fortunately because of properties of hearing more or less.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_01
 For the higher bands, if you put in just some garbage, some noise, it doesn't really matter all that much.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_01
 It sounds a bit worse but it's not a big tragedy.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_01
 If you want to do a good voice speech, you want to get a lower band.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_01
 If you put in a noise altogether, it sounds like a whisper speech.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_04
 It sounds like LPC when you excite it by noise.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_04
 By noise.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_04
 It's better.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_04
 I would say.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_04
 Better quality.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_04
 Definitely better quality.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_04
 It's a lower bit right but that's a problem.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_01
 So now we have to kill them both because I mean we gave all the secrets away.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_01
 It's going to.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_02
 Any objective measures you use for...

0:21:06	SPEAKER_02
 Objective measures?

0:21:07	SPEAKER_02
 Objective measures?

0:21:08	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it was some distances, spectral distances.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it didn't work so well.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_01
 If Motor Aronokia gets hold of this tape, then we are in trouble.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_01
 Hopefully by then it will be protected and everything right.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, the help I just said that we shouldn't talk about confidential things.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_01
 It's a problem.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_01
 But listen, this is a science.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_01
 It's a confidential to extend that we are not publishing it yet.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_01
 But we offer it well.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_01
 But we have to make sure that if Qualcomm has an interest who's funding the work, they have to have a chance to patent it or something.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_01
 That's about all.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_01
 This is not a public presentation.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_01
 So this is not even a problem.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, sure.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_01
 The problem would be if...

0:22:00	SPEAKER_01
 But you know, nobody can beat better Motley check anymore.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, if Nokhi knows everything, if you sell it tomorrow, did you work for it?

0:22:10	SPEAKER_01
 No, HP.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_01
 HP.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_01
 They will take half a year before they will even realize what it is.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_01
 And why then?

0:22:19	SPEAKER_01
 So it's not from.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so that's where...

0:22:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so there is a compromise between the lower bands, the worse stuff you just said, and the more bands, the more coefficients they transmit.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_03
 So 15 is about okay.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_04
 Also, there are papers about that if you have like 12 frequency bands, it's somehow optimal.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_03
 So this, and then there is a compression, what about that?

0:22:45	SPEAKER_04
 Compression is only to relate to somehow fit that he'll burn and develop to.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_04
 So that you get...

0:22:50	SPEAKER_03
 So that you can't modulate, actually.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah, you can't modulate better.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_04
 There is no A-horse, something ever brands in the signal.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_04
 If you really go down with that compression factor to like 0.1, something...

0:23:03	SPEAKER_04
 What?

0:23:04	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, compression.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_02
 So what is the compression factor we are getting here?

0:23:09	SPEAKER_01
 When you compress the effectively, what the signal is, the other ring.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_01
 And so then you get the fitted, the compression signal.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_01
 Essentially, if you were in a spec problem and you would compress the power spectrum.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 Here, you compress the...

0:23:27	SPEAKER_01
 The power spectrum.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the city of the signal.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_01
 And...

0:23:33	SPEAKER_01
 And so, any of the products are fitting actually this compressed signal, but you know how much it was compressed, so you can always expand it back so that you get a fit to the original thing, except that the fit is different.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_01
 Because it basically is open modeling has a different properties.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, you just preserve something different a little bit.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you can tell you a little bit more about that.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_01
 This is an old technique which...

0:24:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think Hinek has good math, many papers or some papers or that.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_01
 It was my thesis, even PhD thesis actually.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_01
 It's not a piece.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_01
 I think I read it.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_01
 The STLP was called Spectral Transforming in the Upper Action.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_01
 It was my first ICAS paper ever.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_01
 It was in 1983 Boston.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_01
 You guys were still in kindergarten, right?

0:24:19	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_01
 More or less.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that's terrible.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_01
 But nobody was using it for anything except it was cute, but it was about it.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_01
 And now it seems like that is...

0:24:35	SPEAKER_01
 Since what we are doing here, we are...

0:24:38	SPEAKER_01
 No, LPC is fitting peaks, right?

0:24:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_01
 But when you are modeling here, but envelope, you don't necessarily want to fit only peaks.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_01
 You sometimes want to get a basically good estimate of the envelope.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_01
 So that helps you because this Spectral Transforming allows you to find the right balance between how well is it peaks, how well is it dips and...

0:25:01	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_01
 So, the end of this.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_01
 So, this is...

0:25:06	SPEAKER_01
 So, I think that basically, I don't know what else...

0:25:09	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, you should be asking questions, right?

0:25:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_01
 One thing I wanted to know is...

0:25:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_02
 A good literature on this.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I think you can really take those papers from Marios.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_03
 About three papers.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_02
 That's really tough.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_03
 I have to...

0:25:31	SPEAKER_03
 This is a SAPA or how it's called.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_01
 SAPA and then, yeah, this is...

0:25:35	SPEAKER_01
 Then two papers.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_01
 One is in SAPA, one is in the U-inter speech.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_01
 And one is in the...

0:25:41	SPEAKER_01
 Emery Jju.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_01
 And one was in ASRU.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_01
 It was from Virgin Islands.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_01
 What is SAPA?

0:25:47	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_01
 I tell you what it stands for.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_01
 Statistic and something...

0:25:53	SPEAKER_01
 And conceptual approaches.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_01
 I was an organizing committee.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_01
 I just know.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_01
 You do.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_01
 Every vision.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_01
 And the third structure.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_01
 The third structure.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_01
 And statistics and perceptual approaches.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_01
 That was...

0:26:13	SPEAKER_04
 But there are also reports from IDIAP, I think.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_04
 At least two reports from Marios seem to me.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_01
 But they are the same, right?

0:26:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, they are more...

0:26:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_01
 And then also is there is some more work actually can be traced down.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_01
 I think they're reading less atlases papers.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_00
 Very good.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_01
 Because less atlases is doing a lot of work on coding in this domain.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_01
 He doesn't use all-part model, but he uses DCT and then he...

0:26:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:26:40	SPEAKER_01
 And unless he's an excellent guy, he's a very good mathematician.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_01
 And he's a Stanford guy.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_01
 And really he likes to write things to them.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_00
 So he's very rigorous.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_01
 It's supposed to me, for instance.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, definitely.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_01
 So if you read that, then you know that they are nowhere.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_04
 Sometimes it's unreadable.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_04
 I would say.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_04
 Quite difficult.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_01
 So whatever you get hands-on from less atlas for over past five years, we got this...

0:27:09	SPEAKER_01
 Two years ago, last year, on one of the ICAS, we had like five papers, right?

0:27:14	SPEAKER_01
 All various aspects of this because...

0:27:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_04
 I think this year, I don't know, interspit over one paper, but it was regarded to speech recognition somehow.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_01
 Is that so?

0:27:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_04
 It was not something like speech coding or that DCT, or something like that.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:27:35	SPEAKER_03
 Also, I can...

0:27:36	SPEAKER_03
 Before Mario's left, he has...

0:27:39	SPEAKER_03
 He had actually left himself, but all the files are here.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_03
 And also, all the math-top implementations of these are here, and there is also one big table that he used to...

0:27:51	SPEAKER_03
 To fit in with all kinds of parameters.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_03
 He was also playing with all these compression factors and lands of the...

0:27:58	SPEAKER_03
 Of that, and there is a big table in Excel, which you can look at.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_01
 There's all kinds of speech recognition results, right?

0:28:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah. This was the first time you started using the cluster.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_01
 I remember all the time.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, because it was a big thing here.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_03
 It took a huge amount of time.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_03
 And basically, he was the first one to realize that these guys are pretty slow to do these things.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_01
 Everybody hated him.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_01
 So he...

0:28:24	SPEAKER_01
 That's already...

0:28:25	SPEAKER_01
 I remember.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_03
 He just put here the PMake environment, and he didn't stick to any cluster, or anything. He just put PMake and write it on all the machines here.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_03
 So, at some point, he was using all the available memory by any mistake.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_03
 Also, in the morning, all the machines were just stuck.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_03
 No one could ever...

0:28:47	SPEAKER_01
 I remember Frank came to us.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_01
 Everybody was computing like Mario's.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_01
 We would be all dead.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_01
 That's a frame.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_01
 But I want everybody to come here like for years.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_03
 So these three...

0:29:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because he was doing everything in Madlop, so it was again ten times more demanding than he plus passed.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe, yes.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_04
 It's hard to say.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_04
 No, it's not so bad with that.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_04
 If you really write it well.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_03
 But he did.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_03
 He wrote it well.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_03
 Anyway, because in the code that I wrote, I was like playing also with...

0:29:24	SPEAKER_03
 If the matrix is sparse, I really don't use it all.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_03
 I just multiply from here to here, from here to here.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_03
 Not the matrix, but my matrix.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_03
 I just optimized it a bit.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_03
 And also, blast libraries and all these things.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_03
 But...

0:29:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_03
 Whatever.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_01
 That's not important.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_01
 It is important.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_01
 You know, why?

0:29:44	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, this is something which we never talk about, right?

0:29:47	SPEAKER_01
 How much work?

0:29:48	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah, sure.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_01
 It is important for this.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_01
 It's true that things sped up tremendously since I came.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, of course, partially because they started to buy some more hardware.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_01
 But also, at least some people know how to...

0:30:04	SPEAKER_03
 But there is a backend recognizer which I will give you, which is turned around of 18 minutes.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_03
 From 11 to 15 minutes, normally it would take an hour and an half.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, no, no, today it was over one hour.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_03
 It's just like 10 times less, maybe you're 5 to 10 times less.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_03
 But still, you can... you can... five times more?

0:30:26	SPEAKER_01
 So do you already know what is the situation with you?

0:30:29	SPEAKER_01
 You go back to Prague for a while and then did you get anything in France?

0:30:33	SPEAKER_01
 I got some ideas, by the way.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_03
 Great.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_03
 I have to talk to you about these.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't try to anything.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't even mail to... to a lot of people.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_03
 I was like...

0:30:45	SPEAKER_03
 I just talked to one girl there, which told me that he would be possibly able to find me a job there.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_03
 Any job, like related, maybe to feel, but job, not anything, any research.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_03
 So if nothing, then I could be able to get the job somewhere.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_01
 You don't die of hunger.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, probably.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but...

0:31:06	SPEAKER_01
 That's not the idea.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_01
 We'll try something.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_01
 So, Joel, the old man basically singes as I told you when we were walking.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_01
 That whatever path is there, that it doesn't die.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_01
 But it carries, and obviously, you very much hope that you get into that and you get excited and you do more or maybe even different things.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_03
 We hope that you find out that everything was wrong and that the potential is much bigger.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it actually works that way.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_03
 It's not that it doesn't work.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_03
 No, but after you find out the bug, then it will be... that will be the...

0:31:54	SPEAKER_03
 So, we will send you the papers related, and I will point you to all the code, which I have.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we're regarding this FBLP.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_01
 And this is all on the record, so if we...

0:32:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, he can't play with his work.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_03
 So, actually, I can just now tell the locations of all the files and you can rewind.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_01
 But I was through the meeting.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah, I said it.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:32:27	SPEAKER_01
 How are we doing time-wise?

0:32:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think half hour, it's fine, right?

0:32:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_03
 Any more things?

0:32:36	SPEAKER_01
 You will be here almost until end of...

0:32:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, until 24.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_03
 Is the Friday, November?

0:32:45	SPEAKER_01
 November, yeah.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_01
 It's just like I will just start teaching and then I will need an assistant.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_03
 There's no better response, but better.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_03
 Better is good.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_01
 Hopefully it makes a pay-pay some extra.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_04
 What are you going to talk or to teach?

0:33:03	SPEAKER_04
 It's just that perceptual stuff.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it's actually a combination of...

0:33:07	SPEAKER_01
 Really, a combination of two classes I was giving at OGI, which is like speech processing and perception.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_01
 And so I try to put it together so that it makes some sense.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_04
 Do you already know how many students you have?

0:33:20	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_01
 I should have at least four because this is a...

0:33:25	SPEAKER_01
 Graduates.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_00
 I have one, right?

0:33:27	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, it's guaranteed.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_01
 I have one guarantee that I don't know if anybody else is...

0:33:31	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I think Guillermo was...

0:33:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, four credits or...

0:33:35	SPEAKER_02
 Total four.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if it needs to be for credit or not.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know how much I like people without not taking it for credit because then they just sit there and have it in time.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_01
 But it's okay.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, it's okay.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_02
 Because in ICE it's for credits.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_02
 Guillermo is taking, I think, here.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_01
 Guillermo is taking it.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_01
 Very good.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_01
 And so I already have at least two.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_01
 I probably get four.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_04
 I would like to go there, but not just for credits.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_04
 Just maybe to hear something new.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_01
 And it's possible.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_01
 That's for sure.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, that's...

0:34:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_03
 Last time it was... for me it was good.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_03
 The course from one special reason because when there were the flats in Turkey, I lost all my papers from my school, all the exercise books.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_03
 How to say this?

0:34:40	SPEAKER_03
 The notes, notes.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, all the notes, parents and everything.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_03
 All notes from any courses.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_03
 So I was remembering what I was learned.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_03
 And there was thought at the time, so I had it now back, at least partially.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_03
 Because all the algorithms you were speaking about...

0:35:00	SPEAKER_01
 I couldn't get into too many things, actually.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_01
 The reason was that at the time we thought I was teaching with Erwe.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_01
 And we thought we had much more time.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_01
 And suddenly we ran out of time, basically.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_01
 What happened was that it was supposed to be three hours, actually, it was only two hours, actually.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_01
 And Erwe assumed that it's going to run longer, or I don't know what he assumed.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_01
 But suddenly we said, it was all... so where are you?

0:35:26	SPEAKER_01
 I said, well, I'm slowly getting into LPC.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_01
 I said, why would I... we have all the three more lectures.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_01
 I have to teach H and M and everything.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_01
 So I... Erwe's part was like I had to do it in one hour.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_01
 And everybody was totally confused, I guess.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_03
 And also in the... in the lab labs, the people didn't know anything about it, and they just followed the papers.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_01
 It was... it was a D.P.F.L.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_01
 Let's see.

0:35:58	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, guys, I think that unless somebody has still anything, it will be important not to this topic.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but I can come to...

0:36:11	SPEAKER_01
 Right, it's a little bit up to you.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_01
 You have to... you have to back this, especially, that's because, just to make sure that...

0:36:20	SPEAKER_03
 Anyway, after I'm back, I'll be still on Skype and all these things.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_03
 So no problem to contact me until, I don't know, May next year.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_01
 So, you've seen that it will be done by May? Is it done?

0:36:32	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I would like to.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_01
 I think so.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we made a mistake, I tell you.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_01
 I think if I had to do it again, if you made a mistake, you should have registered here at E.P.F.L.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_01
 You would have had a degree by now from E.P.F.L.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I was a mistake.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_03
 But I would have to study here for the... the long time, no?

0:36:50	SPEAKER_01
 Three years.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_01
 You were already... you were here.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_01
 You were here. How long you were here?

0:36:55	SPEAKER_03
 Two years, yeah.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_03
 I would have to stay one more.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_03
 Well...

0:37:01	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it would be good reason for that, but I have to stay here.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_01
 So, is she getting another position there already?

0:37:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, because she has a good position because she has a friend who is starting a lab there.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, I see.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_03
 It's a great opportunity for her, at least.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_03
 But the problem is, then she will go back and there's a family, she's amazing.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_03
 For a girl, it's always the pain because she has to break for some time, at least a little, but has to break and in the science it's not that easy to break.

0:37:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_02
 So, in case I need something on this E.P. I'll come to you.

0:37:49	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, sure.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_01
 Otherwise, I'm also much more available than I was.

0:37:53	SPEAKER_01
 When you came, it was just like one of the craziest times of the year.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:02	SPEAKER_01
 It's not that I was very perfect if it was doing anything useful, but it was like...

0:38:07	SPEAKER_01
 It's a little bit like writing thesis all the time, writing and make little changes.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_03
 But I think definitely you are the best person in here, too, with a reality, to availability of you.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_03
 Because if I want to go to her, I probably call Secretary, he's there, and when I can...

0:38:27	SPEAKER_03
 Many more people to take care of you.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_03
 There was no...

0:38:32	SPEAKER_03
 Every time I came to you, you were available.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_01
 I think we are trying to be because this is also my livelihood, right, students?

0:38:42	SPEAKER_01
 It's hard to be sure that they need to know something, that...

0:38:49	SPEAKER_01
 So, feel free, basically, to stop by anytime.

0:38:54	SPEAKER_01
 It's not that I know everything, but...

0:38:58	SPEAKER_01
 If I know...

0:39:00	SPEAKER_01
 I think I sort of know a little bit like what you guys were doing.

0:39:05	SPEAKER_01
 But not every detail.

0:39:09	SPEAKER_03
 You know, the core, which we don't remember anymore, while programming.

0:39:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you don't know why you are doing it.

0:39:16	SPEAKER_03
 We know the details, and you know what is...

0:39:19	SPEAKER_04
 What is the global stuff?

0:39:21	SPEAKER_04
 Why are you doing this?

0:39:23	SPEAKER_04
 It's good.

0:39:25	SPEAKER_03
 Ask my boobs.

0:39:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, my mic is falling, so I think we go, huh?

0:39:32	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you very much.

0:39:34	SPEAKER_03
 Thanks a lot.

0:39:35	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:39:40	None
 Oops, I have to take this off, I think.

0:39:42	None
 I'm going to take this off.

0:39:44	None
 I'm going to take this off, and I'm going to take this off.

0:39:47	None
 I'm going to take this off, and I'm going to take this off.

0:39:51	None
 Okay, well, I hope that it was working out.

0:39:58	None
 Definitely a little bit, I mean, it seems like...

0:40:01	None
 It's kind of a start.

0:40:03	None
 So, you know, you're never going to...

0:40:05	None
 It's a little bit tricky.

0:40:06	None
 I think we should have a little bit of a bit of a...

0:40:09	None
 No, I'm not.
