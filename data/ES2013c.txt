0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 I put that back there.

0:00:07	None
 Oh no, get this thing.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_03
 No, it was up there and not here.

0:00:24	SPEAKER_03
 Now it's here and not there.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_03
 And then one more time it should come up the right way around.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_00
 Ah.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_00
 Hi Kate.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, carry on.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_03
 This is the beginning of the third meeting, the conceptual design meeting.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_03
 Our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_03
 I have the minutes from the previous meeting on the shared drive at this point.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_03
 And we should each have a presentation to make.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_03
 We have certain decisions to make and we have 40 minutes total.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's 25 after two at the moment.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_03
 So 40 minutes is 5 after three.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_03
 Which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_03
 They're the decisions we have to turn to but we'll come back to them in a minute after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_03
 As we remember, I opened the meeting before us for present.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_03
 The meeting, the first meetings minutes were reviewed and approved.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_03
 Sarah, you presented a marketing research report.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_03
 Which pretty much represented that 15, 35 year olds has to be handheld.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_03
 Power channel volume number keys, possibly your speech recognition.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_03
 And then Steph did the second presentation.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_03
 That those functions plus streamlining them with big user friendly keys that were easy to use.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_03
 I think all of us agreed with those things.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_03
 Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_03
 That it should be a simple mass produced device because of the 12.5 pence cost.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_03
 But we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place is a selling point.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_03
 And the new requirements that it could be for TV only.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_03
 And that it include the so slogan and color of the corporate design being included.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_03
 The corporate image. So we agreed that the target market would be 15 to 35 with more money than cents that were decision makers alternatively would be a manufacturer to enclose with TV, but it still should meet those parameters.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_03
 And the function we agreed was volume power numbers enter channels away to move between channels easy to use and handheld.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_03
 At that point, we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_03
 What what are the current ones sell for?

0:04:03	SPEAKER_03
 And Steph was going to look at economics. Kate was going to look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_03
 And I was to type up these minutes and work on the final report.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_03
 Is this a fair presentation?

0:04:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_03
 What our last meeting was.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_03
 So we're ready to close that and go back to our.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_03
 That one.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_03
 We're up to the point of the.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_03
 Go back.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_03
 The three presentations.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_03
 So we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to Sarah.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_03
 Is that okay?

0:04:54	SPEAKER_03
 Is that right with everybody else?

0:04:56	SPEAKER_03
 Especially since Kate asked to be last.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_03
 Sarah, I'm sorry if I misspelled your name.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't know what this essay or a or a.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_03
 You respond to whatever you get.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_03
 Did you do your.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_03
 There it is.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_00
 Ta-da.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_02
 I'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's a good idea.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's a good idea.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_00
 Are we talking about the device itself or a cover for the device that be an interchangeable cover as a separate product?

0:12:45	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's a good idea.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:13:27	None
 I think it might be more useful if Kate went next.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_01
 I think it might be more useful if she went next.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_02
 I think it might be more useful if she went next.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_02
 I think it might be more useful if she went next.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_02
 I think it might be more useful if she went next.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_02
 I think it might be more useful if she went next.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_02
 I think it might be more useful if she went next.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_02
 This is a remote that's been opened up.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_02
 This is a push button.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_02
 This is a basic construction that we've got to accommodate.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_02
 We've got to accommodate.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_02
 I want to go through not just addressing the points that you made to the area but doing my presentation in the order I wrote it.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_02
 First of all, I want to talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_02
 We can have your bogs found at double AA batteries, replaceable little compartment.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_02
 We can have a hand.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_02
 A wind up.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_02
 A wind up.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_02
 A wind up.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's quite interesting.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_02
 You actually get the energy by moving the device.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_02
 We had talked about solar power but I think we agreed that that's not so good in the dark.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_02
 I'm afraid this is the options we've got on the case.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_02
 The nearest we've got to sponge you there.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to come back to the advantage of titanium.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_02
 The interface looks like push button.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_02
 You can have multiple scroll buttons.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_02
 We can also incorporate LCD display in the mode.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_02
 The electronics makes the device work.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_02
 We can have three simple regular advanced and the price goes up.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_02
 If we want the nice cheap one, we can only have push buttons.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_02
 If you want the advanced chip, you can obviously cost small but you need a real LCD display.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_02
 The manufacturing division tell me they have recently developed sample sensor, speaker devices.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_02
 The real expertise is in push buttons.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_02
 We have two options.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_02
 We can either go for a cheap model.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_02
 We can have something that looks a bit nicer.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 It could have an LCD screen and multiple scroll buttons.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_02
 It could have the company's new development of the sample sensor and speaker.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_00
 I'm afraid I don't have that information available.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_00
 I'm afraid I don't have that information.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_00
 The company has the colors and styles of the company.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_01
 I've been thinking of something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colors of the real reaction company.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_01
 I've been interested in how to use the real reaction company.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_02
 I've been interested in how to use the real reaction company.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_01
 I've showed you my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you Kate.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_01
 You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_01
 FN and F8.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_02
 If you do what you can, F8 to get it.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_03
 Keep doing it until you get it in both.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_03
 Just do it again.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_01
 I don't have a huge amount of information.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_01
 My method was to look at my inspiration.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_01
 I've been interested in the iPod style scroll wheel.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_01
 I couldn't find the picture of the iPod on the link to the web.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_01
 I was thinking that I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_01
 I was thinking that I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_01
 I was thinking that I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_01
 I was thinking that I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_01
 I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_01
 I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_01
 I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_01
 I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_01
 I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_01
 I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_01
 I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_01
 I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_01
 I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_02
 I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_01
 I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_02
 I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_01
 I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_01
 I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_01
 I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_01
 I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_01
 I quite like it because it's just smooth and handheld and it's got these easily reachable buttons that are quite nicely spaced out.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_01
 Something a bit like that where buttons are arranged in a circle up there and left right.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_01
 You want scroll buttons in that as well.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_01
 I can't write it.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_01
 I think right.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_01
 On the right, down at the bottom, you see where the mouse is.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_01
 This style thing where you have up, down, left and right.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_01
 Enter in the middle, so you pick your menu and then your different options.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_01
 When you click on each one, you can go into a new menu for that.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_01
 I'm getting a bit specific here.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_01
 Really with that.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_02
 You use something to show you the nice design.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_02
 It's playing towards strengths, which are in push-button technology.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think I can get up on this screen.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_01
 Here we go.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the iPod spinning wheel is really complicated.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_01
 It does scroll but it is hugely complicated.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_01
 I'll ask if it does.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_01
 Then that's terrible.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_01
 But they all have this feature of this...

0:29:06	SPEAKER_01
 It's not quite a scroll wheel, but it's a selection.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_01
 It's a kind of selection in this circle, which I think is a really good idea.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_02
 But we can implement it in simple push buttons.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_01
 Which is much cheaper, like, up down, left and right.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_01
 Which is good.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_01
 And then...

0:29:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so either a channel up and down, volume up and down.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_01
 The next appearing programs up and down.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_01
 And then also, when you get to the different menus on the screen, it's got different settings and contrasts.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_01
 So all you really need is these four buttons with the end-turned-the-middle.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_01
 And that's it.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_02
 Look at this one.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, that's really nice.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_01
 Almost impossible to misplace all these.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_00
 You might take up your whole living room.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_00
 Possibly?

0:30:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_02
 We could actually do it in rubber instead of plaster, if you'd rather.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_03
 Or cold or banana.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_00
 Have it in your room.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_01
 There's just something else I need to bring to your attention.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_01
 Have you seen these on a remote?

0:30:47	SPEAKER_01
 This is actually the volume up and down.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_01
 But they both say V on them.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_01
 Which, when you first look at it, you expect that to be the down.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_01
 Because it looks like a downward pointing arrow, but it's actually the V to indicate that it's the volume.

0:31:03	SPEAKER_01
 So we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_01
 But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_01
 If we're having this scroll wheel, then it's going to double up as all the other up and down functions.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think we're going to have a little bit more complicated.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_03
 I want to thank you all for all your presentations.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_03
 We have about 10 minutes left in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_03
 And I think you all have been self-stimulating of working together.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_03
 We need to come up with some specifics of the components, the materials, things like making the decision on the energy.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_03
 And the case and the interface type things.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_03
 So, let's...

0:32:04	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_03
 They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use?

0:32:19	SPEAKER_03
 Which the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery, kinetic, or solar.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_03
 This is where Kate's expertise comes in.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_03
 And our decision-making will be a little bit guided by Kate at this point.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_03
 You were saying that the kinetic would be useful.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_03
 That is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it as opposed to battery that you have to either put it in the rechargeer or keep replacing batteries.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_03
 Or solar that you'd have difficulty with it.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_03
 If it's a dark day that it will die on you in no way to do it.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_03
 That's the day you want to use the TV.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_03
 So, what's our pleasure here? What would be the cost consequences of each of the three?

0:33:15	SPEAKER_02
 Well, unfortunately I don't have cost of information.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_02
 In terms of workability, I think the two front ones are the standard battery or the kinetic.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to say I don't have to pick it up because I'm a different person cost.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_00
 What's the feelings of a group form kinetic?

0:33:35	SPEAKER_01
 Sounds great. I've never come across it before but it sounds fantastic.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_01
 Sounds like it could be really good economical.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_01
 It would make the whole thing a lot lighter.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_01
 It's really quite attractive thought, isn't it?

0:33:57	SPEAKER_01
 It's like, yeah.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_03
 So the consent seems to be used to kinetic if it's at all possible.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_01
 But it does depend how much it costs.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_01
 How much more development and research it leads.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_02
 And how much you do have to keep it moving.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_02
 It's conscious that what you do can be quite a set of productivity.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_01
 So your exercise is where you're watching the TV.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, more environmentally friendly.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so I think it is a thanks for a month or five minutes to finish.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_03
 Thanks.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_03
 The next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, right. Okay. That's something I maybe should have covered.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_02
 Chip on print is just a manufacturing technique.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, and I would certainly recommend it.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_02
 I think because I'm not sure I have an alternative.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_02
 What about way to be the way we progress?

0:35:14	SPEAKER_02
 It's actually built to be print onto the circuit board.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_02
 Like you might print on the paper.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, okay.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_03
 What about the case?

0:35:26	SPEAKER_03
 I think they're talking there about do we want wood plastic titanium or rubber?

0:35:31	SPEAKER_03
 And I think we've discussed not having titanium wanted to expensive.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_03
 And second, it won't do this double curves.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_03
 We sort of eliminated wood who said plastic or rubber.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_03
 What's the pleasure?

0:35:47	SPEAKER_02
 Well, if Sir is keen on spongy field, the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those stress points.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_02
 What about you?

0:36:00	SPEAKER_01
 I think it might need a kind of hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_01
 And then I kind of spongy cover.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, spongy cover.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_01
 So it feels like all things spongy, but actually you're not damaging anything by plastic inside.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_02
 Because I mean, I can't do it in many ways.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_02
 I can't do it in many ways, but I agree it.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_01
 It sounds like an ice-hiding tradition.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_01
 You need to get that carried away with things that are packed, then you just want to stroke them a little.

0:36:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_03
 The thing I want is the user interface concept.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sorry to push you, but we only have a couple minutes to finish.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. And it says, interface.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_03
 What type and what supplements?

0:37:01	SPEAKER_01
 I just copy the one on the left.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_01
 Well, like four buttons up down left and right with enter in the middle.

0:37:12	SPEAKER_01
 But we'll correspond to many on the screen.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_02
 Which I think technically is just push button.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'd like to push button quite a lot.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_02
 And it's something we're in it.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_02
 We're completing it.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_01
 So push buttons.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_03
 So, what's that?

0:37:35	SPEAKER_03
 This is going to sound weird, but the next meeting starts 30 minutes.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_03
 And they actually want a look and feel design user interface design.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_03
 You can look and see this as well as I can.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_03
 Marketing, they want product evaluation.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's still plugged in online.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_03
 Oh my, I'm sorry.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, okay.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry about that.

0:38:02	None
 Missed that one.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_03
 I'm sorry to be fun trying to get this thing to work.

0:38:11	SPEAKER_01
 Tada.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_02
 I think the company's next project should design a better overhead device.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, because I can't even see mine.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_03
 Next meeting starts in 30 minutes.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_03
 These are the individual actions.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, right.

0:38:37	SPEAKER_03
 The look and feel design is for Kate.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_03
 Steph gets the user interface design.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_03
 You get product evaluation.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_03
 The two of you get to play with a plat modeling play.

0:38:53	SPEAKER_03
 And to do a prototype.

0:38:56	SPEAKER_03
 And everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way.

0:39:01	SPEAKER_03
 Anything else we need to do?

0:39:04	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:39:05	SPEAKER_03
 Go to it.

0:39:09	SPEAKER_03
 And that's the end of this meeting.

0:39:12	SPEAKER_03
 That's for her benefit.

0:39:16	SPEAKER_02
 And that's for her benefit.
