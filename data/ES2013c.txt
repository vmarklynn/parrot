0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 No, get this thing.

0:00:22	None
 No it was up there and not here.

0:00:24	SPEAKER_03
 Now it's here and not there.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_03
 One more time, it should come up the right way around.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_03
 I'll just carry on.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_03
 This is the beginning of the third meeting, the conceptual design meeting.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_03
 Our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_03
 I have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point and we should each have a presentation to make.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_03
 We have certain decisions to make and we have 40 minutes total.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's 25 after 2 at the moment.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_03
 So 40 minutes is 5 after 3, which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_03
 They're the decisions we have to turn to, but we'll come back to them in a minute after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting.

0:01:57	None
 Right.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_03
 As we remember, I opened the meeting before us were present.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_03
 The first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_03
 You presented a marketing research report which pretty much represented that 15 to 35 year olds has to be hand held power channel volume number keys, possibly your speech recognition.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_03
 Then Steph did the second presentation that those functions plus streamlining them with big user friendly keys that were easy to use.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_03
 I think all of us agreed with those things.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_03
 Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard that it should be a simple mass produced device because of the 12 and a half pence cost.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_03
 But we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point and the new requirements that it would be for TV only and that it includes the slogan and color of the corporate design being included.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_03
 The corporate image.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_03
 So we agreed that the target market would be 15 to 35 with more money than cents that were decision makers alternatively would be a manufacturer to enclose it with TV but it still should meet those parameters.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_03
 And the function we agreed was volume power numbers, enter channels, a way to move between channels, easy to use and hand held.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_03
 At that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_03
 The current one is self-worth and Steph was going to look at ergonomics.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_03
 Kate was going to look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed and I was to type up these minutes and work on the final report.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_03
 Is this a fair presentation?

0:04:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_03
 Our last meeting was.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_03
 So we're ready to close that and go back to our that one.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_03
 We're up to the point of the go back.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_03
 The three presentations.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_03
 So we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to Sarah.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_03
 Is that okay?

0:04:56	SPEAKER_03
 Is that right with everybody else?

0:04:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_03
 Especially since Kate asked to be last.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_03
 Sarah, I'm sorry if I misspelled your name.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't know what this S.A.R.A. or S.A.R.H.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_03
 You respond to whatever you get.

0:05:12	None
 Okay.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_03
 Did you do your yes to it?

0:05:29	SPEAKER_03
 Ah, there it is.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_00
 Ta-da.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_00
 I'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_00
 I think I appreciate the time to figure out Joyce has to go in.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's close.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's close.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's close.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's close.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's close.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's close.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's close.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's a good idea.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_03
 Don't you?

0:08:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_03
 It sounds like the covers that they use for the remote,

0:09:02	SPEAKER_00
 you know, your cell phone. Exactly.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's something that's not a good idea.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_00
 It's something that's not a good idea.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_00
 Hmm.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_00
 They actually make the use of spongy.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_00
 They can be in the midst of a fact.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_00
 They can start it.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_00
 And breathe.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_00
 Breathe.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_00
 Breathe.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_00
 Breathe.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_00
 Breathe.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's an active thing for me.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_00
 It's a lot easier to get in and the remote can go.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_00
 It's a little bit easier to get in the window.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_00
 It's spongy, it's a little bit further in mind.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_00
 And the answer is, while the function has been with everyone from outside.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_00
 What we're talking about is changing the concept of everyone's happy to be the lead.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_00
 But then we are in the fact that we need a lead.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_00
 We are in the fact that we need a lead.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_00
 That's the common concept of the concept of a lead.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_03
 Hmm.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_03
 Hmm.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_03
 Um.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_03
 In most families don't, isn't the remote use a remote?

0:10:26	SPEAKER_00
 But I think that this is a lot of things that have to be written in the past.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_00
 Hmm.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_00
 So when your dad's sitting there overriding your decision going, no, we're going to watch this.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_00
 You can bring out your own remote and be like,

0:10:48	SPEAKER_01
 is that? No, we're going to watch this.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_01
 Well, actually some households do have three and four

0:11:02	SPEAKER_03
 TVs and they would have a remote for each one.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_00
 So this is a good idea. I think that's the reason that the open sound is being a little bit spongy.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_02
 I think we're going to have some trouble when we get down to the component design.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_02
 Spongy is going to be difficult, I'm afraid.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_01
 Hmm. And as for, as for, um, well, budgeting as well. If we're going to have lots of different interchangeable components.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_02
 Is this ear to the market? Yeah. I mean, basically we can make these things out of wood, titanium, plastic or rubber. I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_02
 I was thinking titanium.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_01
 I was thinking, it's just, I have been influenced by pictures of

0:12:02	SPEAKER_00
 the slides and they're also minimalistic, shiny.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_03
 Are we talking about the device itself or the, or a cover for the device that be an interchangeable cover as a separate product?

0:12:38	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it would be a very simple product.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_03
 Perhaps that's, that particular suggestion, you need to go back to management and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_03
 Let's delegate.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_03
 Would that be agreeable? Yeah.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_02
 Would it be helpful if I describe the components a bit because I think it would give you, um, maybe bring this discussion back to earth of what we can actually physically do.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, maybe. Do you want it if you next or you want Kate to go next?

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 I think possibly I might be more useful. Kate went next.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_01
 You can even have them in different flavors as well.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 So if you just want to sit there and chew on the remote, it could be like

0:13:44	SPEAKER_00
 a pair of flavors. Yeah. Scratch and sniff.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_02
 Right. Well, I think some of this, um, you're going to be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you, but I'm afraid this is the real world.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_02
 So, um, I've been looking at the, the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_02
 I've had some discussions with the manufacturing division who have told me what's actually available, what the current state of the art in components is and some of the exciting new things they've got, but I'm not sure of it.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_02
 It's quite, um, this isn't a very good overhead, but this is just to show you.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_02
 This is the earrings of a remote control.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_02
 I really need a pen or something, but I don't know how that works now.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_02
 Um, oh yeah. Can you see my little mouse pointer?

0:14:46	SPEAKER_02
 This is, this is a remote that's been opened up.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_02
 And that's the, the back of the interface.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_02
 And this is a push-button one. So you see these little, little buttons here, little rubber, rubber buttons that go through onto the board of the back. And they push these buttons here.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_02
 Um, and we, that's the basic construction that we've got to, got to accommodate. We've got to have something that pushes the little buttons that, um, talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the message to the receiver.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_02
 So, um, I want, I want to go through not, not just addressing the, um, the points that you made, Sarah, but, um, doing my presentation in the order I wrote it.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_02
 So, first of all, um, I want to talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source. Um, we can have your bog standard double A batteries, you know, replaceable little compartment. We can have a hand that's a wind up, a wind up, yeah. Which I think is quite an interesting concept for a, a remote control, but it maybe doesn't quite go with the, um, the fruit and veg.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_02
 Alright.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_02
 One, one that I think is quite interesting is the connection in the energy source where, um, you, you actually get the energy by moving the device, which is kind of like a nice neat one. You have to, it means that if it's sitting there for a long time, it probably won't work, but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then. Or we, we had talked about solar power, but I think we agreed that that's not so good in the dark.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_02
 Now, I'm afraid this is the options we've got on, on the case. It can be made of plastic rubber, would if you like.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_02
 Or titanium. Um, and the nearest we've got to sponge you there, I guess is rubber, but, um, I'm going to come back to the advantage of titanium. And basically it can have a flat surface, a curved surface, or a double curved surface, but I think if we want to use standard components, we're going to have difficulty with anything much beyond that.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, what does the interface look like? Um, well, push button, that's, that's the one we're all familiar with. Um, we can have scroll buttons and the scroll button can incorporate a push, so you can have it like on a mouse, where you can use it to go up and down, change volume or channel or something like that, and push to select something. Um, you can have multiple scroll buttons. Um, this is maybe getting a little bit complicated, but um, it's, if the technology is there. And we can also incorporate an LCD display in the remote, but this will increase the cost.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_02
 Um, the electronics actually makes the device work. We basically got three simple regular advanced and the price goes up, as we choose each of this. If we want the nice cheap one, the simple, then we can only have push buttons. All the other fancy interface designs go out the window, right? Um, pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons. If you want the advanced chip, it obviously costs more, but that's what you need if you want the LCD display. And the manufacturing division tell me that they have recently developed um, sample sensor, sample speaker devices. Now, I don't know what that is, but I think they think it's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere. Um, our real expertise is in push buttons, I have to say, but maybe you think that's old technology. And well, I think we've got two options. We can either go for a really cheap model, people if we cost down, um, which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons, or we can have something that looks a bit nicer, I think. Um, it might look like a pineapple, but um, they all may not have.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_02
 Um, but it could have an LCD screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons and it could have the company's new development of the sample sensor and speaker.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_00
 So, thank you.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I'm

0:19:43	SPEAKER_02
 afraid I don't have that information available. Um, manufacturing can't actually give attention to any prices to any of this in the front.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_00
 Bare in mind it has to be the colors and styles of the company. So,

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it. But, um, I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colors of the new reaction company.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_01
 It's just what I had understood. We've been going, that's before I heard about all this hot, hot, tips for the future fruit rice. We could, we could do a double curved

0:20:49	SPEAKER_02
 rubber one which would allow, um, say, a banana. But, um, unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that we have to have a push pull as the interface. We can't do anything else here.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_01
 Shall we wait till I, so I've showed you what, well, my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you, Kate.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_01
 You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_01
 So, it's a bit pointless.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_01
 And, uh, yes.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_00
 I don't have a minor.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_02
 Do it again.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_03
 Keep doing it until you get it in both.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_03
 You get it there, you get it yours.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_03
 And then you get it for both.

0:22:19	None
 Just do it again.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_03
 This time I should come up with this.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_01
 Right then.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_01
 I don't actually have a huge amount of different information.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_01
 Can I say just that my method was to look at the, well, my, my inspirations, which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing, including MP3 players.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_01
 Like, you know, high-five robots, not just television, these things.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I think about the feature of each one is what functions we actually need and then how to group and arrange these on the actual, the actual plastic or rubber handheld piece.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_01
 I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel, which, right, I couldn't find the picture of the iPod on the link to web browser, I couldn't copy and paste it.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_01
 But it had a similar thing to this thing on the right.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_01
 It has scroll wheels without a display, but they scroll like a computer in the house.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_01
 I was thinking that a really simple interface was just a couple of scroll things on it.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_01
 And then instead of a display, the display could appear on the television screen.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_01
 Like, I guess, an existing sky or cable one does.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_01
 Like, you know, you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_01
 And you can do, you can scroll along and it will show you what's on the next half hour.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_01
 And you scroll up and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_01
 The same channel on the screen.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_01
 But I'm also eagerly taken with this chunky plastic kitty remote, which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice big, easy buttons to press, but still quite simple and quite cost effective.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_01
 So what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple, not fancy, but not totally minimalist.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, just pretty simple plastic.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_01
 Probably I was thinking yellow and black just because that's the company's colours with very, very few buttons, but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_01
 Like, you know, just small along the bottom.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_01
 Instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remote, which is quite expensive.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_01
 And when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you, you might as well have it appearing on the screen in front of you.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_01
 And so on that you can just match in the same way as an existing sky remote.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_01
 Scroll along, scroll up and down.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_01
 And I definitely support these plastic and all rubber.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, titanium would be great, but I think it might be a bit too expensive.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_01
 And too, kind of spacey. If we're trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic, then titanium is too futuristic.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_02
 It's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_02
 We can't pretty much have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_01
 Whereas the plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_02
 Then the having the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea because otherwise we're putting up the price, not only for putting building the LCD in, but for the electronics as well.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_01
 And it's a little bit pointless as well I think.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_01
 When you've got the screen there, it doesn't have to be anything fancy, just a little menu showing.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, a menu, going to a menu, it can have different options whether you want to change the settings, or the information about programme that's on at the moment.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think that's too taxing to engineer.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_01
 But as for actually arranging them, let me go back to the picture of the kitty one.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_01
 And I quite like it because it's just smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely spaced out, so something a bit like that where buttons arranged in a circle up down left right.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_01
 Do you want to scroll buttons in there as well?

0:27:56	SPEAKER_01
 I was thinking not actually scroll like a mouse scroll, but you know, I can't quite describe it.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_01
 I think right, you see on the one on the right down at the bottom, the mouse, yeah, see where the mouse is, like this style thing where you have up down left and right.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_01
 And enter in the middle, so you pick your menu and then your different options and when you click on each one, you can go into a new menu for that and get a bit specific here.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_01
 Really would have to use something to show you in nice part of design.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_02
 It's playing towards strengths which are in push-backing technology.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_02
 Here we are.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_01
 I think I can get up on the screen.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_01
 Here we go.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the iPod spinning wheel is really complicated.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_01
 It does scroll, but it is hugely complicated.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_01
 But that's a good answer.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_01
 But they all have this feature of this.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_01
 It's not quite a scroll wheel, but it's a selection.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_01
 It's a kind of selection in this circle which I think is a really good idea, but we can implement it with simple push-backing.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_01
 It's just much cheaper, like up down left and right.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_01
 Which is good.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_01
 And then, yeah, so I mean either channel up and down, volume up and down, next up here in programs up and down.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_01
 And then also when you get to the different menus on the screen, it's got things like settings and contrast.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_01
 So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_01
 That's it.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_02
 In fact, look at this one.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, that's really nice.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_01
 Almost impossible to miss place or lose.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_00
 Might take up your whole living room.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_00
 Possibly.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_02
 We could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you rather.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_00
 Or call it a banana.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_01
 Is there something else I need to bring to your attention?

0:30:44	SPEAKER_01
 Have you seen these on a remote?

0:30:46	SPEAKER_01
 This is actually the volume up and down, but they both say V on them.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_01
 Which, when you first look at it, you expect that to be the down because it looks like a downward pointing arrow.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_01
 But it's actually the V to indicate that it's the volume.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_01
 So we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_01
 But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_01
 If we're having this scroll, then it's going to double up as all the other up and down functions.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_01
 That's complicated.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_03
 I want to thank you all for all your presentations.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_03
 We have about 10 minutes left in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_03
 And I think you all have been self stimulating of working together.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_03
 We need to come up with some specifics of the components, the materials, things like making the decision on the energy and the case and the interface type things.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_03
 So let's.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_03
 They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use, which the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery, kinetic or solar.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_03
 This is where Kate's expertise comes in.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_03
 And our decision making will be a little bit guided by Kate at this point.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_03
 The you were saying that the kinetic would be useful.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_03
 That is you just have to move it so many you'd be able to use it as opposed to battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or keep replacing batteries.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_03
 Or solar that you have difficulty with it.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_03
 If it's a dark day that will die on you and no way to do it.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_03
 That's the day you want to use the TV.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_03
 So what's our pleasure here? What would be the cost consequences of each of the three?

0:33:14	SPEAKER_02
 Well, unfortunately I don't have constant information.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_02
 In terms of workability, I think the two front runners are the standard battery or the kinetic.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to show you. I don't have to figure out how to put some cost.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_00
 What's the feeling for the group on the kinetic?

0:33:40	SPEAKER_01
 It sounds great. I've never come across it before, but it sounds fantastic.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_01
 It sounds like it could be really good, economical.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_01
 It would make the whole thing a lot lighter.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_00
 Hmm.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_01
 It's really quite attractive thought, isn't it?

0:33:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_03
 So the consensus seems to be used to kinetic, gifted to all possible.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_03
 But it does depend how much it costs.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_02
 And how much you do have to keep it moving.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_02
 I'm conscious that watching TV can be called as a disability.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_01
 Do you exercise as well? You're watching the TV.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:24	None
 More environmentally friendly.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_03
 So I just think it is a thanks for the monger for five minutes to finish.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_03
 The next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, right. Okay.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_02
 That's something I maybe should have covered.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_02
 Chip on print is just a manufacturing technique.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_02
 Oh.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_02
 And I would certainly recommend it, I think, because I'm not sure I have an alternative.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_02
 What about the way we progress?

0:35:13	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, the way we progress.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, okay.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_03
 What about the case?

0:35:26	SPEAKER_03
 I think they're talking there about do we want wood plastic titanium or rubber?

0:35:30	SPEAKER_03
 And I think we've discussed not having titanium one is too expensive.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_03
 And second, it won't do this double curves.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_03
 So we've got a lot of aluminum with sort of eliminated wood.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_03
 You said plastic or rubber.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_02
 What's the pleasure?

0:35:48	SPEAKER_02
 Well, if there's key spongy feel, the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress bones.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_01
 So what about you?

0:36:02	SPEAKER_01
 Do you not think it might need a kind of hard plastic in our shell with the actual delicate workings inside?

0:36:11	SPEAKER_01
 And then a kind of spongy cover.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's thick, spongy cover.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_01
 So it feels like the whole thing is spongy, but actually you're not damaging anything by plastic in size.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_02
 Because I mean, I carried away with the texture to get about whether that's actually possible, but I agree it sounds like a nice idea to produce.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_01
 You didn't get that carried away with things that attack tile.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_01
 Hmm, it's still good.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_03
 The next part they want is the user interface concept.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_03
 I'm sorry to push you, but we only have a couple minutes to finish with.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, and it says interface.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_03
 What type and what supplements?

0:37:00	SPEAKER_01
 I'll just copy the one on the left.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_01
 Well, like four buttons up, down, left and right, with enter in the middle,

0:37:13	SPEAKER_02
 that will correspond to a menu on the screen. Which I think technically is just push button.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I'd like to push button.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_02
 It's something we're going to accompany the next one.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_03
 So push bones.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_03
 This is going to sound weird, but the next meeting starts 30 minutes.

0:37:39	SPEAKER_03
 And they actually want a look and feel design user interface design.

0:37:45	SPEAKER_03
 You can look and see this as well as I can marketing.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_03
 They want product evaluation.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, oh my, I'm sorry.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, okay.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry about that.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_03
 Missed that one.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_03
 This ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_01
 Ah, ta-da.

0:38:15	None
 Ah.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think the company is the next project should design a better overhead device.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_03
 Because I can't even see mine.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_03
 Next meeting starts in 30 minutes.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_03
 These are the individual actions.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, right.

0:38:37	SPEAKER_03
 The look and feel design is for Kate.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_03
 Steph gets the user interface design.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_03
 You give product evaluation.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_03
 The two of you get to play with the plot modeling play to do a prototype.

0:38:54	SPEAKER_03
 And everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way.

0:39:01	SPEAKER_03
 Anything else we need to do?

0:39:04	SPEAKER_03
 Go to it.

0:39:09	SPEAKER_03
 And that's the end of this meeting.

0:39:12	SPEAKER_03
 That's for her benefit.

0:39:17	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:39:20	None
 No.

0:39:23	None
 No.

0:39:26	None
 No.

0:39:30	None
 No.

0:39:35	None
 No.

0:39:38	None
 No.
