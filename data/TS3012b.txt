0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 for the marketing director.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_01
 Anyways.

0:00:08	None
 I knew this new memory.

0:00:12	SPEAKER_01
 See, shall we wait? I'm not sure if he is later or later, whatever. So I'm going to start there.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_01
 A little problem with the computer.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_01
 Welcome again to today, functional design phase.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to take you over the minutes of the lesson. That's meaning okay, that was just to get to know each other, have a little thoughts on what your vision is on this project. I'll put the minutes on the, I made on the project chair. So if you want to review them there, I will do this so after every meeting. So if you have some information, I want to take back to confining there. Anyways, today for presentations for every one of you, after I got some new project requirements from Project Board, so we're going to go off, go off, go over those later. But I want to start with the stuff you did first so we can see what everybody came up with.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_01
 After that, we can have the new requirements and shares and thoughts.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_01
 We would like, want to go first?

0:01:30	SPEAKER_03
 There was a little problem with my computer, so not the wool press station. Anyway, let's see what you have.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, and I still have it open. I want to

0:01:52	SPEAKER_03
 open my, I should close it on your own notebook, I guess. There. Yes.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_03
 The functional requirements, it's very important for the user who wants to, the method we used, it's not a slide because it went wrong, but the method we used, we tested it with a hundred men and we asked them to what the remote feel like and what's

0:02:34	SPEAKER_01
 important. Is it people or men? People, sorry, people, okay, both women were the only men.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_03
 The findings, 75% of the use is find most remote controls ugly.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_03
 That's pretty shastling, so we have to do something about that.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_03
 They want to spend money for a better system, for better remote control, so we can do a little nice things with it.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_03
 And the use, yeah, the use a lot.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_03
 A 50% say they.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_03
 So that's the most important thing.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_03
 Not all, is it on my PowerPoint press station? The relevant buttons are the power, the channel selection and the volume selection.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_03
 The most basic buttons the user wants to use, less important teletext.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_03
 They use it, but it's not very important on the scale of 0 to 10, they 6 and a half, okay, it's okay.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_03
 But not important is the channel selection.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_03
 That's what we have.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_03
 Which channel selection?

0:03:57	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no, no, that's very important.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_03
 But not important is audio settings, display settings, and we can hide those in our menu or something.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_03
 New preferences, preferences, and beep to find your control.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_03
 That was also in the test.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_03
 The most people find it irritating when they cannot find their remote control.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_03
 So I think it's beep to sound it and you can find it.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_03
 And another thing they want was speech recognition.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_03
 So they can say what they want to, let's go to channel one and that's the kind of things.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_03
 And they want maybe an LCD screen to look at what's on every channel and what they want.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_01
 Preview on the remote control.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_02
 Preview on the channel.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_02
 Is that manageable?

0:05:03	SPEAKER_02
 Because it sounds pretty expensive too.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_01
 It sounds too, it's possible, I think it's best, but to continue.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_03
 My personal preference is a better for my favorite channel.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_03
 So I can set to my quick to my favorite channel.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_03
 So the remote must see or must see what my preferences are for which channel.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_01
 So I can set to the channel that you're on most.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_01
 What?

0:05:43	SPEAKER_01
 You want it to be program, for example, or you want it to recognize your favorite channel.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_01
 You see you spend 20 minutes each day on that channel.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_01
 So it recognizes your favorite channel.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_03
 That's what my personal preference is.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_01
 It does recognize itself.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_03
 You don't have to set it.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it's easier to set it.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know it's managed to move.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_03
 I see.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_03
 It's a little bit the end of it.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_03
 I lost the computer address.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_01
 So it's okay.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_01
 Shall I go?

0:06:23	None
 Go ahead.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_02
 So some technical functions.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_02
 Basically I have some issues which you discussed earlier.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_02
 Let's just start with the method.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_02
 It sounds really easy.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_02
 What does the user do?

0:06:47	SPEAKER_02
 What does the remote control do?

0:06:49	SPEAKER_02
 But there are quite some issues.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_02
 So the things I'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_02
 Because the technical aspect, that's pretty much covered.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_02
 We can do that.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_02
 What goes wrong with the user?

0:07:03	SPEAKER_02
 Gets the remote control.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_02
 Where is the remote control?

0:07:07	SPEAKER_02
 I want to watch on television.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_02
 Where is the remote control?

0:07:11	SPEAKER_02
 That was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_02
 Really good idea.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_02
 These are just the issues.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_02
 I come to some personal experience, findings, possible solutions later.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_02
 Searches for the button.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_02
 There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_02
 So either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_02
 Also, symbols tend to fade after a while.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_02
 There's nothing more annoying than faded symbols.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_02
 Because you don't know which channel is this button.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_02
 Possibly we could find the...

0:07:49	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to make it more durable.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_02
 Covered that.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, the user presses the button.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_02
 Usually when you have a lot of buttons, buttons are small.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_02
 Once the remote control goes...

0:08:05	SPEAKER_02
 To blew or something like that.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_02
 We have to pay attention not to put too many buttons on the remote control.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_02
 Possibly also the size.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_02
 More important buttons.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_01
 Bigger buttons.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_02
 This is basically what I had in mind in the fade proof symbols.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_02
 Locator, a sound.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_02
 Clear.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_02
 We should stick to existing symbols.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we could do a little investigation to see whether some symbols are needed to be replaced by others.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_02
 This is pretty much covered.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_02
 So what we want to go to is not this one.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_02
 But more.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_02
 Less buttons.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_02
 Easy.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_02
 Bigger buttons.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_02
 So that's basically where I had in mind.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_02
 This is not the final design.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_02
 I have a great idea of how I'd like to see a general idea.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_02
 So that was it.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_01
 That was it.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, that was good.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_01
 So we agree on the part that we need to get something on the remote to find it somewhere.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's a really good idea.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_01
 The durability of the thing.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_01
 Other aspects we'll just see when you came up with.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_01
 What's possible for that budget?

0:09:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_04
 Now, work a little with me.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_04
 The method.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_04
 There are a few questions that need to be answered.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_04
 You already talked about it a little bit.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_04
 Which buttons are wanted?

0:09:53	SPEAKER_04
 Is our remote control universal or should it be programmable?

0:09:57	SPEAKER_04
 If it should be programmable, then we need something like a mode that you can switch it.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_04
 Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal than they would normally do.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_04
 And how big is the remote control going to be?

0:10:09	SPEAKER_04
 I'll tell you why that's important to me.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_04
 There are a lot of technical parts in remote control.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_04
 So that's why I also would like to say.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_04
 I'll go a little bit easy on the designs.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_04
 I heard you talking about beeps and about video screens.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_04
 But the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_04
 So keep in mind that everything that you keep think of, it has to be built.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_04
 So that's not as easy as it might look like.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_04
 Material study, I'm working on that.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_04
 For the costs, I have to check out how far I can go with that.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_04
 The circuit board is made of fiberglass and wires are made of copper.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_04
 That is how it is done and all remote controls work that way.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_04
 I think we can just go on with that.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_04
 Then I've read more integration of materials.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_04
 It means less cost for the production.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_04
 The more we can make at once in one piece, that is cheaper.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_01
 We may integrate them all into the circuit board.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_01
 Exactly.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_04
 So if we make a circuit board with the connections already on it, then that's cheaper.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_04
 So we have to make something that's not too difficult in design again.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_04
 This is what it looks like if you press one button.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_04
 So this is not the entire thing.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_04
 You have the power coming in.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_04
 Then you have like a switch.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_04
 If you press it, then some electrical charge goes into the processor.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_04
 That thinks of a MOS code.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_04
 That's how you should see it.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_04
 The MOS code goes to the amplifier.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_04
 Then the signal assumes two light bulbs.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_04
 You have infrared and an inter...

0:11:43	SPEAKER_04
 I already said a light and indication light, that you know that it's functioning.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_04
 Here again, that's my story about the different modes.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_04
 If you want to make remote universal, then the processor has to make up a different MOS code when some button is pressed.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_04
 That makes it much more complex.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_04
 So we really need to have a look.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_04
 Do we want that?

0:12:05	SPEAKER_04
 Or not.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_04
 I don't have any personal preferences so far except for the materials to be used light.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. That was it.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_01
 I'll get back to my thing then.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, back to this screen.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_01
 So I got some new information on the project specification or changing a little.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_01
 Like you said, TEDx is not very popular anymore.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_01
 The internet, people don't use TEDx anymore or hardly.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think we should remove the button because there are always people who are using it.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_01
 But I don't think it should be one of the big buttons, for example.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_01
 Just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_01
 It's not important anymore.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_01
 We're targeting young people now because this is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people, which we define under 40.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_01
 It's also good with the fashion and everything.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_03
 They want to pay for it.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_01
 People are willing to spend money to buy a remote that they like.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_01
 It looks the way it functions so they're actually going to spend money on it.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_03
 We're with more technical specifications.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, of course.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_01
 We can go with that anyway.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_01
 One thing that should be important is that the corporate color and slogan are recognizable, which is apparently black and yellow.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if we should keep the logo in mind because with colors you can have a lot of fashionable colors and everything on it, which suits everybody's taste.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_01
 With that concept, I started thinking why not just steal Nokia's idea and just make changeable covers for your, I mean, those cost hardly anything, I think, and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_01
 So I have an entire new remote control that they like to see.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_01
 For example, we could make a different basic design and sell the cover separately.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_01
 For example, that's just a little marketing idea that could be applied so we can appeal to really everyone.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_01
 So you don't have to, I think you don't have to make entire remote controls and make a basic one and manufacture the cover separately.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_01
 So that was my idea and what we could do to appeal this product to everyone.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_01
 So just not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime after making a presentation.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_01
 You like to share?

0:14:45	SPEAKER_04
 No, I think this is a good idea.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_00
 But is it manageable?

0:14:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_03
 With an LCD screen?

0:14:53	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should lose the LCD screen.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_01
 Why?

0:14:56	SPEAKER_01
 For example, it's huge.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_01
 I think the LCD screen is huge.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_01
 It consumes batteries like hell.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_01
 I think it takes over a lot of power.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_01
 It costs too much to pass a lot.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_01
 What we could do could be possible is maybe not an LCD screen with a preview, but I'm not sure if it's even possible.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_01
 For example, a little TV guide.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_01
 Like you have just a text only, not a color, just a little text thing so you can use remote as a TV guide.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure it's even possible.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_01
 I have to check that out.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe I can find a little compromise in that.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_01
 But when it's done, I think the beep is a very simple thing to implement.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_01
 Just make a button on your TV and just hit the button and beep somewhere.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's easy to implement.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_04
 You want to button on the television?

0:15:41	SPEAKER_04
 I think.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I mean, where else should you put it?

0:15:44	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, but that's rules out universal remote control.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but how are you going to use that if your remote control is lost?

0:15:53	SPEAKER_01
 Why are you going to press the button?

0:15:57	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe just a slap on sticker with a button which sends out a...

0:16:01	SPEAKER_01
 A slap on sticker.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, you mean like a separate thing you can attach to your TV?

0:16:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that could be possible.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_01
 A little box.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, that's good.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_04
 I'd like to know now if we want the universal remote control, not because that's...

0:16:15	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's done with everything I'm going to do.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should go for universal because apparently we're a separate company making separate remote controls.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_01
 To sell to a lot of diverse people.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_01
 I think universal remote control is to be possible.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_03
 Every one wants to buy it.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think we're targeting everyone.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_04
 It's fine with me, but then I know what to look at.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_01
 Universal is good.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_01
 Speech recognition, I think it's very hard because we're selling across multiple countries.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_01
 So I think implementing speech recognition is such a small...

0:16:44	SPEAKER_01
 Appritus is very hard to do.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_03
 Or when you say one, two, it's...

0:16:52	SPEAKER_01
 You know, to see Arabian people speaking one, two, whatever.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_02
 Besides that, the technology isn't really super yet.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_02
 It's a problem in the amount of energy.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_01
 I think it takes a lot of memory and everything in the remote control.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_02
 It's a good idea, but it's just not...

0:17:05	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think the market's right for that yet.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_01
 You should look into the materials that are a little durable.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_01
 So the symbols won't fade, maybe a little harder plastic or...

0:17:21	SPEAKER_01
 Especially the ones that have to do all the buttons, especially the ones that are the popular buttons.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_01
 So those always fade first.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_01
 The thing that's the most important things that we have now.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_01
 Let's see.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_04
 If we make remote control with changeable covers, then we can also make a cover for every language area.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_04
 Especially for older people that they can read it in the old language.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_01
 We're not targeting older people.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_01
 Remember that?

0:17:48	SPEAKER_01
 Everything we target is under 40.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_01
 You assume that they read correctly.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_01
 I think the most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to trends that are passing through the world.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_02
 But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves?

0:18:04	SPEAKER_01
 No, I think it's just something you put over them.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_01
 That's not even a bad idea.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_01
 For example, if you're into durability issue, you could, for example, if your buttons are faded, if you make a durable remote, they're faded.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_01
 You can just buy a new cover.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure it's hard to make.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_01
 But I know a bad idea.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_04
 The buttons are like an Oket telephone on a one sleeve.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_04
 So you don't have to change your whole cover.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_04
 If you can make something that you can only remove the sleeve.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_04
 I know what you mean.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_04
 It works the same as an Oket telephone.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_01
 It's in my mind.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_01
 It's just one piece of rubber.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_01
 Exactly.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's what I mean.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm going to have to look into either change both the buttons and the cover or just the cover.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure which is easiest.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway, yeah.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_01
 This is what we're going to do after.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_01
 Just a lunch break and have more individual work after that.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll just see where we can see the...

0:19:04	SPEAKER_01
 So you have to come up with the components concepts.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_01
 You shouldn't trend watching because...

0:19:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_01
 Even if we're going to do those covers and everything, what people really want, that's what we need to know in this phase.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_01
 Because that's going to be the essential final design we're going to come up with.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think usually in a phrase is pretty obvious.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it should be very intuitive.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it should speak for itself.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_01
 For example, I bought a remote control last week with any TV.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_01
 It's like old buttons and you have no idea what it does at first.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_01
 And I'm not a total TV nuke, anyway.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_01
 So I think it should be less or very little buttons and maybe a second level menu for the advanced things.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_01
 Or maybe just stick them under a menu.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_01
 Like you said, the sound options and this around or whatever.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_01
 The more complicated, just stick them under one menu and I give it that.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_01
 Just put it in a software piece, you can menu and you can select everything you want to set on your TV.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_02
 Is it technically possible to send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu because we're working with different types of television.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_02
 So we're going to work on that.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_04
 That is true.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think so.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_04
 Not that's true.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think so.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_04
 Because the television needs to respond to the signal.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't know how.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_04
 It's not.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_04
 That's not possible.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_02
 So basically we...

0:20:28	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if it's impossible, but there's a chance it's not.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_02
 Or we could use a double-sided for less used functions.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_01
 A double-sided remote control?

0:20:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think that's useful.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_02
 With a cover.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_02
 It's basically an idea to overcome these issues.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but then you're going to have a lot of wasted buttons.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_01
 For example, you have a Sony TV.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 The half of the buttons won't function if you have a Sony.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_02
 Basically, functions which are not frequently used.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think we should.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_02
 Universal remote control.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_02
 We're going to have to have most buttons on it.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_02
 A notch.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, for example, you have to make a little decision between the part...

0:21:07	SPEAKER_01
 If you want a universal remote control that it should do, what people usually do with their TVs.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_01
 Not the very complicated settings.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_01
 They can usually do that with either the old remote control if they really hate that thing.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_01
 But you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of TVs.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_01
 I think there is a standard, for example, between...

0:21:30	SPEAKER_01
 Usually, the menu button is usable between different brands.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_01
 Especially the big ones, the big brands.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_01
 I have a universal remote control on it.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_01
 You can use the menu button.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_01
 I think I'm not sure if you can put some research into that if it's possible.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_01
 I think just the navigation is very basic.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_04
 I think there must be a way to invoke the more complicated functions of the television.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_04
 For instance, if your old remote control is broken and you buy hours, then you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's true.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_01
 I think you know if the function is by-products.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_01
 We need to buy it into that if we can open the menu.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's possible.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_01
 I think you can do everything.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_01
 I suppose because usually the TVs have that inside, inside their little pieces of software.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_04
 I think that our remote control should not look like any other.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_04
 For instance, Sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all the devices.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_04
 And you always grab the wrong one because the formatting of the buttons is exactly the same.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_04
 Only the labels are different.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_01
 I think it should be a little distinct from everything else.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_01
 It's either both different.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe the shape can be a little different.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_03
 It's a little more curved to whatever.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_02
 We have different colors.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_02
 I'll put someone paper and present them next time.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_01
 It's time on.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure what.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_01
 We had 40 minutes.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_01
 I heard a beep.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but it wasn't me.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_01
 It was him closing something.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway, we could do some work now under design.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_01
 What do you want?

0:23:11	SPEAKER_02
 Not a trial and everything.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_01
 We'd like some curves or maybe something like this.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_01
 With a little smooth inside.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_01
 So you have the transmitter here, for example.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_01
 Let's see that you.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 What would be handy?

0:23:25	SPEAKER_01
 I think that the button should be the channel button should be on the run.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_01
 Let's see.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_01
 Got it.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_01
 Damn it.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 I'll get the general idea.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_01
 Another one here.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_01
 Let's see what I think this is always on top of the control.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_01
 So this should be here.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_02
 And since you're holding it like this, I suggest you put the channel up, channel down.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_01
 With it.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, just take it.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_02
 So you have the up channel.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the channel.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_02
 The volume.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_02
 Do we want that horizontal or vertical?

0:24:01	SPEAKER_01
 You take triangles or what?

0:24:03	SPEAKER_03
 It's fine.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_01
 I think it should be what people are accustomed to.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we should make them bigger or whatever.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, no, it's just a general idea.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe the menu button can go in the middle.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, in the middle.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_01
 Usually out there.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_04
 Perhaps you should also make something like a flash on it if it's lost for people that are deaf.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_04
 They won't hear the beep.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but for example, if it's lost in your armchair.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_01
 You'll be able to find it.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_01
 And flash takes up a lot of batteries again.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's true, but it's only has to do so when you press it both and that it's lost.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we could make a combination that it goes beep and that you.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_01
 That's what you might use as people.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I thought for deaf people, for example.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_01
 We could do that.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_01
 Just to lie down a little bit.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_02
 So we have the basic channels we've got here.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_02
 The power button.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's true.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_02
 Somewhere over here.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_01
 It should be central.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_01
 You shouldn't be, you shouldn't press it by accident, but it shouldn't be stacked away.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_02
 I usually press it on top.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's what I'm accustomed to.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I guess going to work.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_04
 Not sure if it's possible.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_04
 What would you like to raise?

0:25:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I thought maybe you'd move the button.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_03
 And you're already reading from where to.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_03
 You always read from the top to the bottom of the bottom.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think the power button should be on top.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, first thing you do.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_01
 Turn it on.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_01
 So power button on top.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, mute button.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_02
 Is that somewhere here?

0:25:40	SPEAKER_01
 I think it should be at the bottom.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_02
 Is that what you're talking?

0:25:44	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_02
 The mute button.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_02
 The people who turn it on off.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_02
 I'm pretty much accustomed to it right over here.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_02
 At least in general.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it's important.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_01
 I think it should be here.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_03
 Or if the volume selection.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_01
 No, because people are accustomed to it.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_03
 Around the volume selection.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know where exactly, but take this out.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_01
 I see.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_01
 Are we going to take triangles anyway?

0:26:17	SPEAKER_02
 I'm drawing triangles, but that's pretty much what people are accustomed to.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's maybe a bigger, less than thing.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway, I think this should be the channels.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_01
 What?

0:26:32	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I'm accustomed to the channels being here.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's better.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, should we channel this to channel up and down?

0:26:42	SPEAKER_04
 So we also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_04
 That you don't have to buy no matter if it's...

0:26:49	SPEAKER_01
 It's one part, it's a good thing to recharge it.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe should...

0:26:54	SPEAKER_01
 What could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries, for example.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, just put pet light batteries that are rechargeable.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_01
 But that's possible.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_01
 It's that expensive and very annoying.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if it's expensive, but just take a look at it.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_01
 Because it might be a very good idea.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_01
 Because it's useful to have it rechargeable.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_01
 But at the same time, if you don't want to recharge...

0:27:17	SPEAKER_01
 If you forgot to recharge it and you want to watch TV now, if you want to be able to put different batteries in it, use it now and not in half an hour.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, but you could make it a price, but I'm not sure how that's...

0:27:27	SPEAKER_04
 It's possible with the cost that you can put in...

0:27:30	SPEAKER_04
 No matter.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_04
 It's rechargeable, but I think I have a nice idea.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_04
 The remote also can act as a rechargeable.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_04
 So then you can choose. You have every decision.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_04
 Know what I mean?

0:27:40	SPEAKER_04
 Not exactly.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_04
 You can put in normal pet lights, rechargeable pet lights, but they can also be recharged with the remote.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's a pretty good idea to have...

0:27:49	SPEAKER_01
 Like sort of a, maybe a base station that you put on the TV, it'll be flat. You could insert your remote into it.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_04
 But I think that will cost a lot.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_04
 Normal wire would be better.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_04
 Like a PDA, a handheld.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_04
 You can just put it in the electricity and it charges itself.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, we have a thing with a little separate signaler.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_01
 So you could add this with that on the TV, for example.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_01
 It could be very flat.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_01
 It would be very small.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_01
 It's a very small...

0:28:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'm drawing it big now, but...

0:28:21	SPEAKER_01
 So you can put your remote on flat, for example.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_01
 And at the back side of your remote, just a little hole.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_01
 For example, you just put it on and recharge it.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_01
 For example, I think it's very...

0:28:32	SPEAKER_02
 But again, isn't that too expensive?

0:28:35	SPEAKER_02
 Because that means that we have to implement...

0:28:37	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if it costs a lot of money.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_02
 That's what we chargeable batteries, a docking station.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_04
 That's what you buy yourself.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_04
 I want to try to find out about it.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not sure if there's information in there or an idea.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_02
 If it's possible.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_02
 And do people actually want that?

0:28:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, they want to pay for it.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_01
 They want to pay for it.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_01
 They want to pay for it.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_01
 They want to pay for it.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_01
 They want to be chargeable.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_03
 You should find out if it's rechargeable.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_03
 Of course.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_03
 There was no...

0:28:56	SPEAKER_04
 I'll ask.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_04
 These are comfort issues.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_04
 So I think people will pay...

0:29:00	SPEAKER_04
 They wanted to pay for comfort.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_04
 Well, this one...

0:29:02	SPEAKER_01
 The ones to pay for comfort, which is...

0:29:03	SPEAKER_01
 We could either make a separate station, which just sends the signal to the remote control to either beep or flash.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_01
 We could find it.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_01
 And...

0:29:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we have to either that or make it integrated with a docking station.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_04
 I think this is a brilliant product.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_04
 I would buy it myself.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_01
 I think it would be good, actually.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_01
 I like to be part of it anyway.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:29:29	SPEAKER_01
 I like the covers.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_01
 That's brilliant idea.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_01
 Can we save this?

0:29:32	SPEAKER_01
 Or is this good?

0:29:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's...

0:29:34	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, we can save this.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_01
 We can save the end.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_01
 Everything, sir.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_01
 So what do we have here?

0:29:46	SPEAKER_01
 You have...

0:29:47	SPEAKER_01
 I think you have to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_04
 I hope if I have information about that.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe...

0:29:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, or...

0:29:54	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you could find out what people are willing to pay.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_01
 We are going between...

0:29:57	SPEAKER_01
 For your sales price.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_01
 But just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_01
 Because if they're willing to pay more, we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_01
 That's the merger we just have to see what that looks like.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_04
 I would like to make a decision model.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_04
 What it costs and what kind of material is that we can choose what we want to get.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and you have some financial information that I need.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_01
 That'd be nice.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_02
 Could you post some other essentials of what people want so that I can work with some buttons where to put it?

0:30:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_02
 You seem to have information on that.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_02
 I'd like to...

0:30:32	SPEAKER_04
 See some of it.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_04
 Was it not possible to send emails around the office?

0:30:36	SPEAKER_04
 No, it wasn't.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_01
 It was possible, not allowed.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_01
 So that's not my nature.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_00
 I doubt you would have pressed it.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:30:44	SPEAKER_01
 I don't care.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_01
 I also have an information.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_03
 But...

0:30:48	SPEAKER_03
 I have to...

0:30:50	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I have your PowerPoint presentation.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_02
 I can get some information out of that.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I have to...

0:30:57	SPEAKER_03
 The homepage of our...

0:30:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's my...

0:31:01	SPEAKER_01
 I'd include the new one.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, just...

0:31:03	SPEAKER_01
 Where would we...

0:31:04	SPEAKER_03
 Here's my marketing report.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you can look at that.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_03
 And that.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_02
 Where would we want the...

0:31:12	SPEAKER_02
 Tele-Tech button.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_00
 And...

0:31:14	SPEAKER_00
 And...

0:31:15	SPEAKER_00
 What does that...

0:31:16	SPEAKER_02
 Not that important?

0:31:17	SPEAKER_01
 Do we create somewhere over any word?

0:31:19	SPEAKER_01
 And...

0:31:20	SPEAKER_01
 Let her say it.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I just increased it a little because...

0:31:23	SPEAKER_03
 And what people want...

0:31:25	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, maybe this is something for the next meeting.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_02
 I've...

0:31:28	SPEAKER_01
 I've brought some designs...

0:31:30	SPEAKER_01
 I have to not have figured out...

0:31:32	SPEAKER_01
 Just keep in mind that the important button should be on top.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_01
 And it'll be...

0:31:35	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we have less important.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_02
 Decided more or less the basic structure.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_01
 I can put the other buttons in.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_01
 Just play a little with this.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_01
 Put a little up or down.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_01
 And we'll see what looks best.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_04
 What did you want to say?

0:31:45	SPEAKER_01
 Or just post your designs from time to time on the product share.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_03
 What I already said is...

0:31:50	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe another.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_03
 The remote controls are always lost.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_03
 But it's also for people...

0:31:57	SPEAKER_03
 They want to learn it fast.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_03
 They want to...

0:32:00	SPEAKER_01
 We don't want to...

0:32:01	SPEAKER_01
 We want very little buttons.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_01
 Just to put this, you use a lot.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_03
 It's easy to learn.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_02
 It should cover all the functions.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_02
 So, possibly just an idea that...

0:32:09	SPEAKER_01
 We had functioned what people do.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_01
 So, people change channels.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_01
 They change the volume.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_01
 And they change channels.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_01
 They turn TV off and on.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_01
 For example, that's the basic...

0:32:19	SPEAKER_01
 That's what you do.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure who presented that again.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_01
 But those are the basic functions that people use it for.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_01
 So, those should be very well represented.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_02
 So, we could go a step further because some TVs have the possibility to just brightness.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_02
 That kind of menus.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_01
 But that's what we stick under the menu button.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_01
 Everything is usually in every TV that's configured under the menu.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_01
 But that's what we make.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_04
 Because it needs to be configured in a television.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but if it isn't, then we cannot reach it.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_04
 We need to adjust to the...

0:32:45	SPEAKER_04
 I think most modern TVs have it in their menu.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_04
 True.

0:32:49	SPEAKER_04
 Isn't that possible to do research in that?

0:32:52	SPEAKER_04
 Let me know that for sure.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_04
 If you rule out functions, then that gets known, then people are not going to buy it.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_04
 Then the consumer bond or something says, you cannot do this and that with it.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_04
 If...

0:33:04	SPEAKER_04
 That's commercial.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_04
 Let's see what we can come up with.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_03
 Another thing I want to say is that we are looking at the market for the age younger than 40.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, true.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_03
 On my report, I didn't show it in my press stage because my computer press.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_03
 They want to pay for an LCD screen and speech recognition.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_04
 Did I really say that like that?

0:33:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_03
 Those two things.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_04
 Did I realize how much that costs?

0:33:37	SPEAKER_02
 That's almost unbelievable.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_02
 We're not going to be able to sell it for 25 then.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_04
 But now you're in your screen.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_04
 That's even...

0:33:46	SPEAKER_01
 If they've noticed that, then we cannot do it for that price.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so we're not focusing on this.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_01
 All the interesting features, not really the LCD screen.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_01
 What do you pay for a speech recognition?

0:34:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_04
 That's true.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_03
 So we can...

0:34:09	SPEAKER_03
 Speech recognition is...

0:34:10	SPEAKER_03
 We can look at the possibilities for an LCD and...

0:34:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, just looking at the possibilities.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, apparently it's what people want.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_01
 How much it would cost?

0:34:19	SPEAKER_01
 What do you call the serious remote?

0:34:20	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it's not even that expensive.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_01
 Or find a compromise, maybe just a black and white.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_01
 I...

0:34:25	SPEAKER_01
 For some extra information on it.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_04
 I doubt it.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_04
 I really need finance information.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_01
 Me too.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_01
 We all do.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_01
 Welcome.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's something we should put into consideration apparently.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_01
 It's what people want.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_01
 We should see what it costs if it's possible.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:41	None
 Yeah.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_01
 We should do a little thing about the design because it looks boring, really, to me.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_01
 Even if you put a different cover on it, it looks...

0:34:52	SPEAKER_04
 It looks color.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_04
 And the design.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_04
 That's what it's different.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_01
 This is like...

0:34:57	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, it's Phillips, huh?

0:34:58	SPEAKER_01
 Phillips has this.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_01
 No clue.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_01
 I have back to you.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_01
 I just drew something where we would fit into your hand easily.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_02
 Something like this.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_02
 To make it kind of futuristic.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, I realize if we make it small, then it needs to be a little thicker.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_04
 Because I need to put all the electronics in it.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry?

0:35:16	SPEAKER_04
 If we make it smaller, that's why it.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_04
 Then we need to make it a little thicker because I have to put all the electronics in it.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we have to keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, we can stick it in there, I think.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_01
 Even if in the worst case, you can even...

0:35:33	SPEAKER_01
 You get me the pen back?

0:35:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, sure.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_01
 So, let's say people would want an LCD thing.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_01
 Let's take the basic design again about the crap.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_01
 I came up with...

0:35:46	SPEAKER_01
 I'll just make it a little bigger now.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_01
 So, it tries to make it here.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_01
 Let's say we have an LCD screen.

0:35:58	SPEAKER_01
 People want an LCD screen.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_01
 So then we should probably put it here.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't have to be really big, but it just has to be there.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_01
 Things to good place, people don't.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_03
 If you're reading from top to bottom, I think it's better to put it at the top.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_01
 It's not the most important function.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_01
 It's just an extra thing.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_01
 You press the buttons on top because your finger is on top.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_03
 If you are going to put an LCD on it, I think it's very important to use it.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_03
 Because it uses it...

0:36:29	SPEAKER_01
 How can you use an LCD screen?

0:36:31	SPEAKER_03
 But the function of it...

0:36:34	SPEAKER_03
 So, you can use it in maximum because it's caused a lot.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_02
 So, it now looks pretty much tucked away in your hand.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_01
 If you press a button, you can see it right.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_01
 I'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_04
 I personally would prefer it on the top.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_04
 You would prefer it on the top.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_01
 So, we have three people saying it's beyond top.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_01
 But the Daniel would have to stack away your button somewhere else.

0:37:02	SPEAKER_03
 Anyway, expensive to build it.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_03
 I'm still not used to it.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_01
 I'm still not used to it.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_01
 Well, they also use things.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_01
 If it's possible, if it's not too expensive, we should include it.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_04
 It's cool.

0:37:15	SPEAKER_04
 We should just try to make out if it's possible.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_04
 If it is possible, we should really do it.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_04
 We need that information.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_04
 Also, keep in mind again, the LCD screen is very flat.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_04
 But it needs transistors, resistors.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know what more.

0:37:29	SPEAKER_04
 And that needs space.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_04
 So, I'll have to look if that's possible.

0:37:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, no.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_02
 So, basically, what we have to decide now is what goes on top.

0:37:42	SPEAKER_02
 Do we put the volume control and the channel control here?

0:37:46	SPEAKER_02
 Or do we put it on here?

0:37:47	SPEAKER_02
 Would we like to press it in the middle?

0:37:49	SPEAKER_01
 In the middle?

0:37:50	SPEAKER_01
 That has it on the bottom.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe in a circle, for example.

0:37:53	SPEAKER_01
 Like in this example, I think this is not good, but we could make circular buttons, for example.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_01
 For up and down, make it a certain point.

0:38:02	SPEAKER_02
 Do you agree that we keep this at the center?

0:38:04	SPEAKER_02
 Because it's basically the most important.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_01
 I think the channel button should be in the center?

0:38:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:09	SPEAKER_01
 The channel button should be stick together, for example, here in this section.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that would make them quite small.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_02
 We're not sure about the size anyway.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_01
 Just the general design.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_01
 And make it as big as you want.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_02
 For example, you can take a big remote control.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_02
 Probably not something with people with hearts.

0:38:24	SPEAKER_04
 Let's see.

0:38:25	SPEAKER_04
 For example, if we have a space issue, we can also lose one battery.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_04
 It is rechargeable, so we can stick with one instead of two.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think if we even use an LCD screen, we need two.

0:38:38	SPEAKER_01
 Definitely.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but if we need two batteries and an LCD screen, that means another space.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we have to see what the size is.

0:38:47	SPEAKER_01
 LCD doesn't have to need to be very big.

0:38:50	SPEAKER_04
 No, but the things behind it, they need space.

0:38:53	None
 Let's see.

0:38:54	SPEAKER_01
 I can finish.

0:38:55	SPEAKER_01
 I'm meeting now.

0:38:56	SPEAKER_03
 Finish meeting now.

0:38:57	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, well, so would you like this or would we like the?

0:39:03	SPEAKER_01
 I have to decide what people want.

0:39:05	SPEAKER_01
 Either this one.

0:39:06	SPEAKER_01
 This could be the luxurious one.

0:39:09	SPEAKER_01
 So we have channel buttons here.

0:39:11	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just drawing something.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_01
 I think this would look cool.

0:39:19	SPEAKER_01
 You could have it, for example, small buttons here for some extra functions.

0:39:26	SPEAKER_01
 So if you're basic functions here, what should we like we decided before?

0:39:30	SPEAKER_01
 Programs up and down.

0:39:35	SPEAKER_01
 And a volume here.

0:39:36	SPEAKER_03
 And then what about the speech recognition?

0:39:39	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if we could do that, but you could put a microphone in here.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_03
 Or an LCD or an LCD.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_03
 I think LCD is better now.

0:39:47	SPEAKER_01
 We took due research into both what it costs and what it takes for space.

0:39:51	SPEAKER_01
 But let's cut the menu for now.

0:39:53	SPEAKER_04
 One more thing I'd like to say.

0:39:55	SPEAKER_04
 Let's give this a name and not like some vagu-serial number that no one understands.

0:40:01	SPEAKER_04
 Like with God.

0:40:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay.

0:40:03	SPEAKER_01
 Shall we try to think about a name?

0:40:04	SPEAKER_01
 I think so.

0:40:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, let's think of a name.

0:40:06	None
 Okay.

0:40:07	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:40:11	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:40:14	SPEAKER_01
 Anyways, the minutes will be on the web shortly.

0:40:18	SPEAKER_01
 There we go.

0:40:19	SPEAKER_02
 Go and finish up.

0:40:21	SPEAKER_02
 And I'll steal that lunch.

0:40:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:40:29	SPEAKER_04
 Good luck.

0:40:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, for all.

0:40:31	SPEAKER_03
 Same.

0:40:36	None
 You need to lunch break, okay?

0:40:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I do.

0:40:39	SPEAKER_04
 Do we have any questions?

0:40:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I have a question here.

0:40:50	SPEAKER_00
 I think we can do a weird thing.
