0:00:00	SPEAKER_04
 So we're on.

0:00:02	SPEAKER_04
 And somewhere is my agenda.

0:00:05	SPEAKER_04
 I think the most important thing is Morgan wanted to talk about the ARPA demo.

0:00:10	SPEAKER_09
 Well, so here's the thing.

0:00:13	SPEAKER_09
 Why don't we start off with, again, I'll get it.

0:00:19	SPEAKER_09
 I think we want to start off with the agenda.

0:00:22	SPEAKER_09
 And then given that, listen, Andreas, we're going to be 10, 15 minutes late.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_09
 We can try to figure out what we can do most effectively without them here.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_09
 So one thing is, yeah, talk about demo.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_04
 IBM transcription status.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_09
 IBM transcription.

0:00:45	SPEAKER_09
 What else?

0:00:46	SPEAKER_09
 SmartCom.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_09
 SmartCom.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_04
 What's SmartCom?

0:00:51	SPEAKER_04
 We want to talk about, we want to add the data to the meeting recorder corpus.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_05
 The data which we are collecting here.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_09
 What are we collecting here?

0:01:03	SPEAKER_04
 So why don't we have that on the agenda and we'll get to it and talk about it.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah, right.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_09
 Right.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_04
 Reorganization status.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_09
 Reorganization status.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_09
 Files and directories.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_04
 Absent, which is the multi-processor Unix Linux.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_04
 I think it was, Andreas wanted to talk about segmentation and recognition.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_04
 And update on SRI recognition experiments.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_04
 And then if there's time I want to talk about digits, but it looked like we were pretty full, so I can wait till next week.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_09
 Right.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_09
 Well, let's see.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_09
 I think the segmentation recognition we want to maybe focus on when Andreas is here, since that was particularly his.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_09
 And also the small, smartCom also.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_09
 Andreas.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_09
 Absent, I think also he has sort of been involved in a lot of things.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_09
 At least he'll probably be interested.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_09
 So I mean, I think they'll be interested in all this, but probably if we had to pick something that we would talk on for 10 minutes or so while they're coming here, I guess it would be your organization status.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I mean, I think Chuck was the one who added up the agenda item.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_04
 I don't really have anything to say of them, and we still haven't done it.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_10
 Well, I mean, just basically that maybe I said, maybe we said this before, just that we met and we talked about it and we sort of have a plan for getting things organized.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_01
 And I think crucial for that is that he's not wanting to do it until right before the next level zero back up,

0:02:56	SPEAKER_10
 so that there won't be any change. Right.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_10
 That was basically it.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_04
 Although Dave basically said that if we want to do it, just tell him and he'll do it level zero then.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_10
 So maybe we should just go ahead and get everything ready.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_04
 So I think we do need to talk a little bit about, well, we don't need to do it during this meeting.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_04
 We have a little more to discuss, but we're basically ready to do it.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_04
 And I have some web pages on more of the background.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_04
 So naming conventions and things like that, I've been trying to keep actually up to date.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_04
 And I've been sharing them with you, UW folks also.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_04
 Sharing them with the UW folks.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_09
 Okay. Well, maybe, since I was pretty sure when maybe we should talk about the IBM transcription status, I'm feeling there's an address later.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. So we did another version of the beeps where we separated each beeps with spoken digit.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_04
 Chuck came up here and recorded some, himself speaking some digits.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_04
 And so it just goes beep, one beep, and then the phrase, and then beep, two beep, and then the phrase.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_04
 And that seems pretty good. I think they'll have an easier time keeping track of where they are in the file.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_06
 Maybe we have to on the automatic segmentation.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_04
 And we did it with the automatic segmentation. And I don't think we didn't look at it in detail.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_04
 We just sent it to IBM. We sort of spot checked it.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_10
 I listened to probably five or ten minutes of it from the beginning.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, really? Okay. And I sort of spot checked here and there, and it sounded pretty good.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_04
 So I think it will work. And we'll just have to see what we get back from them.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_10
 The main thing will be if we can align what they give us with what we sent them.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_10
 I mean, that's the crucial part. Right? And I think we'll be able to do that with this new beep format.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yep. Well, I think it's also there much less likely to have errors.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_04
 So the problem with last time is that there were errors in the transcripts where they put beeps where there weren't any.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_04
 And they put in extraneous beeps.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. And with the numbers there, it's much less likely.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_10
 Yeah, one interesting note is a problem. I don't know if this was just because of how I play it back.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_10
 I say, uh, SND play in in the file. Every once in a while, like a beep sounds like it's cut into two beats.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_10
 Yeah, I don't know if that's a hard effect of playback.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_10
 I don't think it's probably in that original file. I recommend that too.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_04
 That's interesting. I didn't hear that. Yeah.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_10
 But with this new format that hopefully they're not hearing that.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_10
 And if they are, it shouldn't throw them.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_04
 So well, maybe Vera was to it again. Make sure. But I mean, certainly the software shouldn't do that.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_10
 Yeah, that's what I thought. It's probably just, you know, somehow the audio device gets pickups in 30 seconds.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_06
 So they have one number and they know that there's only one beat next one.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. Yeah. The only part that might be confusing is when Chuck is reading digits.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_04
 Seven, four, eight, beep, seven, beep, eight, three, two.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yes. Because we don't cut those out.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_04
 In order to cut them out, we'd have to listen to it. And we wanted to avoid doing that.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_04
 So they are transcribing the digits.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_04
 Although we can tell them or it.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_04
 We could tell them if you hear someone reading a digit string, just say bracket digit bracket and don't bother actually computing the did writing down the digits.

0:06:29	None
 That'd be what I'm having the transcript.

0:06:31	None
 It's here to visit.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. And then I wanted to talk about, but as I said, we may not have time.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_04
 What we should do about digits. We have a whole pile of digits that haven't been transcribed.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_09
 Let's talk about it because that's that's something that I know Andreas is less interested in.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. Do we have anything else to say about transcription about IBM stuff?

0:06:50	SPEAKER_10
 Brian, I sent, I sent Brian a message about the meeting and I haven't heard back yet.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_10
 So I hope he got it and hopefully he's maybe he's gone. I don't know.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_10
 He didn't even reply to my message. So I should probably ping him just to make sure that he got it.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_04
 So we have a whole bunch of digits. I pretty want to move on to digits.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_09
 Actually, I want to relate more related thing in transcription. So that's the IBM stuff. We got that sorted out.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_09
 How are we doing on the on the rest of it?

0:07:20	SPEAKER_01
 I'm doing well. I hire two extra people already expected to hire two more.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_01
 I've prepared a set of five, which I'm calling set to, which are now being edited by my head transcribed in terms of spelling here as well.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_01
 She's also checking through and monitoring the transcription of another transcribed.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_01
 She's going through out of these kinds of checks.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_01
 And I've moved on now to one of the calling sets. I sort of thought if I do it and set through supply, then I can have like sort of a terrible processing through the current.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_01
 And I knew indicated to me that we have a goal now for the dark but demo of 20 hours.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm going to go up to 20 hours. Be sure that everything that's processed and released.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_01
 And that's what level is. Package of 20 hours right now.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_01
 And once that's done, we'll have to do that.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah. So 20 hours, but I guess the other thing is that that's kind of 20 hours ASAP because the longer before the demo, we actually have 20 hours. The more time it'll be for people to actually do cool things with it.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it's possible.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you for accuracy.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah. I mean, I guess the difference if the IBM stuff works out, the difference in the job would be that they primarily would be checking through things that were already done by someone else.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_04
 Incorrected. Correcting. We'll expect that they'll have to move some time bins and do some corrections.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_01
 And I've also discovered so with a new transcriber.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_01
 So let me say that like.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_01
 So at present, people have been doing these transcriptions at the channel all the time.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_01
 And that sort of is useful.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_01
 And once in a while they'll have to refer to the other channels to create something.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I realized that we're using the pre-segmented version.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_01
 And the pre-segmented version is extremely useful.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_01
 And wouldn't it be useful also to have the visual representation of those segments?

0:09:38	SPEAKER_01
 And so I trained the new one, the newest one, to use the visual from the channel that is going to be transcribed at any given time.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_01
 And that's just amazing, we helpful. Because what happens then is you scan across the signal.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_01
 And once in a while you'll find a blip that didn't show up in the pre-segmentation.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, right. I see what you mean.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_01
 And it's something like a back channeler.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_01
 Sometimes it seems to be similar to the ones that are being picked up.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_01
 And they're rare events, but you can really go through a meeting very quickly.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_01
 You just scroll from screen to screen looking for blips.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_01
 I think that we're going to end up with better coverage of the back channels, but at the same time we're benefiting tremendously for the pre-segmentation.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_01
 Because there are huge places where it's just absolutely no activity at all.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_10
 And the audio quality is...

0:10:30	SPEAKER_10
 So they can scroll through that pretty quick.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_10
 Yeah.

0:10:34	None
 That's great.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_01
 So I think that that's going to also see the efficiency of this process.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_09
 Okay. Yeah.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_09
 So, yeah, so let's talk about the digits in the interior.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_04
 So we have a whole bunch of digits that we've read and we have the forms and so on.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_04
 But only a small number of that...well, not a small number.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_04
 Only a subset of that has been transcribed.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_04
 And so we need to decide what we want to do.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_04
 And Liz and Andreas, actually, they're not here, but they did say at one point that they thought they could do a pretty good job of just doing a forced alignment.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_04
 And again, I don't think we'll be able to do with that alone because sometimes people correct themselves and things like that.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_04
 But so I was just wondering what people thought about how automated can we make the process of finding where the people read the digits, doing a forced alignment and doing the timing.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_09
 Well, forced alignment would be one thing. What about just actually doing recognition?

0:11:35	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we know what they read because we have the forms.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_04
 No, they make mistakes.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_04
 Right. But the point is that we want to get a set of clean digits.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_10
 You're talking about it's a pre-processing step, right, Morgan?

0:11:50	SPEAKER_09
 Is that what you're hearing?

0:11:51	SPEAKER_09
 I'm not quite sure what I'm talking about.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_09
 I mean, we're talking about digits now.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_09
 And so there's a bunch of stuff that hasn't been marked yet.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_09
 And it's the one option.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_09
 I was just asking you to start a curiosity.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_09
 If with the SRI recognized that we're getting 1% word error, would we do better?

0:12:22	SPEAKER_09
 So if you do a forced alignment, but the transcription you have is wrong because they actually made mistakes.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_09
 But that's pretty uncommon.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_09
 It's much less common than 1%.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_04
 If we could really get 1% on, well, I guess if we segmented it, we could get 1% on digits.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah. So that's just my question.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_09
 I'm not saying it should be one way or the other, but it's...

0:12:47	SPEAKER_04
 Well, there are a couple different ways of doing it.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_04
 We could use the tools I've already developed and transcribe it.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_04
 Hire some people or use the transcribers to do it.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_04
 We could let IBM transcribe it.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_04
 They're doing it anyway, and unless we tell them different, they're going to transcribe it.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_04
 Or we could try some automated methods.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_04
 Well, my tendency right now is, well, if IBM comes back with this meeting and the transcript is good, just let them do it.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah, you raised a point kind of...

0:13:15	SPEAKER_09
 You've missed it, but maybe it is a serious problem.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_09
 What will they do when they go?

0:13:19	SPEAKER_09
 Here beep, 7, beep, 7, 3, 5, 2...

0:13:22	SPEAKER_09
 I mean, you think though...

0:13:26	SPEAKER_12
 It's pretty distinct. The beeps are pre-ordered from mine.

0:13:30	None
 I'll let me proceed by reading transcripts.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_04
 So also...

0:13:33	None
 Yes.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, it will be in the midst of a digit string.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_04
 Sure, there might be a place where it's beep, 7, beep, 8, beep, 8, beep.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_04
 But they're going to have macros for inserting the beep marks.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_04
 And so I don't think it will be a problem. We'll have to see it, but I don't think it's going to be a problem.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_09
 Okay. Well, I don't know. I think that if they are, in fact, going to transcribe these things, certainly any process that we'd have to correct them or whatever needs to be much less elaborate for digits.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_09
 Right.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_09
 For other stuff, so why not?

0:14:12	SPEAKER_09
 That was it?

0:14:13	SPEAKER_04
 That was it. Just what do we do with digits? We have so many of them.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_04
 That would be nice to actually do something with them.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_05
 Your mic is a little lower.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_09
 And Berkeley, yeah.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_09
 So...

0:14:26	SPEAKER_09
 You have to go early, right?

0:14:29	SPEAKER_07
 Well, I think about...

0:14:32	SPEAKER_07
 Speak 40.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_09
 All right. So let's make sure we do the ones that...

0:14:36	SPEAKER_09
 So there are some...

0:14:38	SPEAKER_09
 In...

0:14:39	SPEAKER_09
 In Adams's agenda list, he had something from you about segmentation in the last record.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_07
 Well, yeah. So this is just...

0:14:48	SPEAKER_07
 Partly to form everybody and help us to get input.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_07
 So we had a discussion...

0:14:56	SPEAKER_07
 And I had a discussion actually about how to proceed with...

0:15:00	SPEAKER_07
 With Don's work and...

0:15:03	SPEAKER_07
 And one of the obvious things that occurred to us was that...

0:15:08	SPEAKER_07
 We were, since we now have feelings, segmentation, and it works, you know, amazingly well.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_07
 We should actually basically re-evaluate the recognition...

0:15:17	SPEAKER_07
 And results using, you know, without cheating on segmentation.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_06
 And so...

0:15:25	SPEAKER_06
 And how do we find the transcripts for those?

0:15:27	SPEAKER_06
 So the...

0:15:29	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah. The reference is for the segment.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_06
 That's not that...

0:15:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, again.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_07
 And once.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_07
 It's a very sophisticated scoring program.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_07
 That you can give a...

0:15:43	SPEAKER_07
 A time...

0:15:45	SPEAKER_07
 You know, you basically just give two time mark sequences of words.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_07
 And it computes...

0:15:53	SPEAKER_10
 You know, it does all the work for you.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_07
 So we just...

0:15:59	SPEAKER_07
 And we use that actually in half-five to do a scoring.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_07
 So what we've been using so far was sort of a simplified version of the scoring.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_07
 And we can handle the type of problem we have here.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_06
 So basically you give some time constraints for references and for the hypothesis.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, maybe the start of your speech in the end of it or something like that.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_07
 It does time constraint where you line up.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_07
 So that should be possible.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, that should be...

0:16:28	SPEAKER_07
 So that was the one thing and the other was that...

0:16:32	SPEAKER_07
 Of course, you got a problem. Oh, that Taylor wanted to use the recognize or linements to train up his speech detector.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_07
 So that you could use...

0:16:43	SPEAKER_07
 You know, there would be so much hand labeling that to generate training data.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I'm just in progress of doing that.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_06
 And I think you're in the positive way that...

0:16:53	SPEAKER_10
 I'll give you a lot more data, too, I want it.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_06
 So it's basically, I think, eight meetings or something which I'm using.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_06
 Before it was 20 minutes of one meeting, so...

0:17:04	SPEAKER_06
 It should be a little bit more.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_07
 The alignment's already perfect.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, but it's probably still better than all this extra data.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_06
 We'll see that.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_08
 Actually, I had a question about that.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_08
 If you find that you can lower the false alarms that you get where there's no speech, that would be useful for us to know.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_08
 There were the false alarms.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_08
 Right now you get false speech regions when it's just like a breath or something like that.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_08
 And I'm interested to know that if you retrain, do those actually go down or not?

0:17:43	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I can make it comparison of the old system to the new...

0:17:48	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah, just to see if by doing nothing in the modeling of just having that training data, what happens?

0:17:53	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah, another one that we had on the Adams agenda that definitely involved you with something about SmartCom.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_04
 Right, so Rob Porzel and the...

0:18:06	SPEAKER_04
 Porzel and the SmartCom group are collecting some dialogues.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_04
 Basically, they have one person sitting in here looking at a picture and a wizard sitting in another room somewhere.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_04
 And they're doing a travel task.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_04
 And it involves starting. I believe starting with a...

0:18:24	SPEAKER_04
 It's always the wizard, but it starts where the wizard is pretending to be a computer and it goes through a speech generation system.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, actually it's changed to a synthesis system.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_04
 A synthesis system.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_04
 And then it goes to a real wizard and they're evaluating that.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_04
 And they wanted to use this equipment.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_04
 And so what the question came up is, well, here's some more data.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_04
 Should this be part of the corpus or not?

0:18:46	SPEAKER_04
 And my attitude was yes, because there might be people who are using this corpus for acoustics as opposed to just for language.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_04
 Or also for dialogue of various sorts.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_04
 So it's not a meeting, right, because it's two people and they're not face to face.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_09
 So I just wanted to understand, because I haven't quite followed this process.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_09
 So it's wizard in the usual sense that the person who is asking questions doesn't know that it's a machine.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_09
 At the beginning.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_07
 I don't know who came up with the flip, but I think it's a little out of the end.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_07
 We simulate a computer breakdown and go through the session.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_07
 So after that, the person's told that they're now talking to a...

0:19:28	SPEAKER_05
 To a human operator.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_04
 Of course they don't know that it's the same person both times.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_07
 Computer and computer data are the same.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_09
 You might want to try collecting it the other way around sometimes saying that the computer isn't up yet.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_09
 So then separate out whether it's the beginning or end.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_04
 I have to go now. You can talk to the computer.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_10
 So if you tell them that the computer part is running on a Windows machine, a breakdown thing kind of makes sense.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_11
 A birthday try fail.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_08
 So do they actually save the far field data?

0:20:04	SPEAKER_04
 That's the question. So they were saying they were not going to.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_04
 Well, let's silly if we're going to try to do it for a corpus.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_04
 There might be people who are interested in acoustics.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_06
 We were not saying we're not doing it.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_07
 We just wanted to do it.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_04
 I see no reason not to do all of them.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_04
 That if we have someone who is doing acoustic studies, it's nice to have the same for every recording.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_09
 So what is the purpose of this recording?

0:20:30	SPEAKER_09
 The acoustic and language model.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_09
 Training data for smart time.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_08
 We can have him vary the microphones.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_04
 For their usage, they don't need anything.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_05
 But I'm going to try about the legal aspect of that.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_05
 Is there some contract with smart come or something about the data?

0:20:51	SPEAKER_05
 Is that our data?

0:20:53	SPEAKER_09
 We've never signed anything that said that we couldn't use it.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_05
 That's the question.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_09
 That's not a problem.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_09
 It seems to me that if we're doing it anyway and we're doing it for the purposes that we have, and we have these distant mics, we should save it all as long as we've got this space.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_09
 This is pretty cheap.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_09
 We save it because it's potentially useful.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_09
 Now what do we do with it?

0:21:23	SPEAKER_09
 Anybody who's training something up could choose to include this or not.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_09
 I would not say it was part of the meetings corpus.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_09
 But it's some other data we have.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_09
 If somebody doing an experiment wants to train up including that, then they can.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_04
 I guess it begs the question of what is the meeting corpus.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_04
 If at UW, they start recording two person, how many conversations is that part of the meeting corpus?

0:21:52	SPEAKER_09
 I think the idea of two or more people conversing with one another is key.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_04
 Well this has two or more people conversing with each other.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_08
 We just give it a name.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_08
 That was my intention.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_08
 Later on some people will consider it a meeting.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_04
 That was my intention.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_04
 Part of the reason that I wanted to bring this up is do we want to handle it as a special case?

0:22:12	SPEAKER_04
 Or do we want to fold it in?

0:22:14	SPEAKER_04
 Would give everyone who's involved as their own user ID, give it session IDs, and all the tools that handle meeting record or handle it, or do we want a special case?

0:22:23	SPEAKER_04
 If we're going to special case it, who's going to do that?

0:22:26	SPEAKER_07
 It's the next answer to the handler with the same infrastructure since we don't want to do the meetings necessarily.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_07
 But as far as distributing it, we shouldn't label it as part of this meeting corpus.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_04
 I don't see why not.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_04
 It's just a different topic.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_01
 It's a scenario based.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_09
 It's human computer interface.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_09
 It's really pretty different.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_09
 But I have no problem with somebody folding it in for some experiment they're going to do.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_09
 But I don't think it doesn't match anything that we've described about meetings.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_09
 Whereas everything that we talked about them doing at UW and so forth really does.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_04
 So what does that mean for how we're going to organize things?

0:23:11	SPEAKER_09
 Again, as I think Andres was saying, if you want to use the same tools and the same conventions, there's no problem with that.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_09
 It's just that it's a different directory.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_09
 It's called something different.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_09
 It is different.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_09
 You can't just fold it in as if it's, I mean, digits are different too, right?

0:23:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but those are folded in and you just mark the transcripts differently.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_04
 So one option is you fold it in and just simply in the file, you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction rather than another type of interaction.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_09
 Well, I wouldn't call reading digits meetings, right?

0:23:43	SPEAKER_09
 I mean, we have to do it.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_04
 But I put it under the same directory tree.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_04
 It's in user doctors, speech data, and more.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_08
 You just have to have it called like other stuff and other.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_08
 Well, I don't know.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_08
 I mean, I don't care what the directory is.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_09
 I mean, that's just.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_04
 My preference is to have a single procedure so that I don't have to think too much about things and just have a marking.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_04
 If we do it any other way, that means that we need a separate procedure.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_04
 If you're someone who has to do that.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_09
 And so whatever procedure you want that's convenient for you, all I'm saying is that there's no way that we're going to tell people that reading digits is meetings.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_09
 Right.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_09
 And similarly, we're not going to tell them that someone talking to a computer to get travel information is meetings.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_09
 Those aren't meetings.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_09
 But if it makes it easier for you to put fold them in the same procedures and have them on the same directory tree and act yourself out.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_10
 There's a couple other questions that I have too.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_10
 And one of them is what about consent issues?

0:24:31	SPEAKER_10
 And the other one is what about transcription?

0:24:33	SPEAKER_10
 Transcription is not a Munich.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_10
 Okay, so we don't have to worry about transcription.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_04
 So we will have to worry about format.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_07
 So that's an argument to keep it separate because it's going to follow the smart contrast description.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, okay.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_07
 Okay, well, I didn't realize that.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_04
 That's a good point.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_09
 But I'm sure no one would have a problem with our folding it in for some acoustic modeling or something.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_09
 Do we have American-born folk reading German, German place names and so forth?

0:25:04	SPEAKER_09
 Yep, yep, yep.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_04
 Great.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_04
 They even have a reading bus.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_05
 That sounds good, right?

0:25:09	SPEAKER_05
 You can do that if you want.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_09
 I don't know if you want that.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_09
 So...

0:25:14	SPEAKER_09
 High-dollberg.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_04
 Disk might eventually be an issue.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_04
 So we might...

0:25:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I'd be pretty good.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_04
 We might need to get some more disk pretty soon.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_04
 We're about half way through our disk right now.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_04
 Are we only half?

0:25:32	SPEAKER_04
 I thought we were more than that.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_04
 We're probably a little more than that because we're using up some space that we shouldn't be on.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_04
 So once everything gets converted over to the disks we're supposed to be using, we'll be probably 75%.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_10
 Well, when I was looking for space for Tilo, I found one disk that had...

0:25:48	SPEAKER_10
 I think it was nine gigs and another one had 17.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_10
 And everything else was sort of committed.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_04
 Were those backed up or non-backed up?

0:25:57	SPEAKER_04
 Those were non-backed.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_04
 Right, so that's different.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_04
 So you're talking about backed up?

0:26:02	SPEAKER_04
 I'm much more concerned about the backed up than non-backed up.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_04
 I haven't looked to see how much of that is.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_04
 It's cheap.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, if we need to, we can buy a disk, hang it off a workstation.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_04
 If it's not backed up, the citizens don't care too much.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah, so I mean, pretty much anytime we need a disk we can get it at the right thing we're...

0:26:17	SPEAKER_07
 I'm sure we're saying this, but you can just...

0:26:21	SPEAKER_07
 You know, since the backed up so every night you can recycle the backed up.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but that's risky.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you really should say that.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_00
 I didn't say that.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's right.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_09
 Detail out.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_09
 We can't allow Dave to listen to these recordings.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah, and there's been this conversation going on about getting another file server.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_09
 And we do that, we'll take the opportunity and get another big raft of disk, I guess.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it's really the backup issue rather than the file server issue.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_07
 You can use our old file server for this to have data that is very fairly accessed.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_07
 And then have the fast new file server for data that is heavily...

0:27:04	SPEAKER_04
 My understanding is the issue isn't really the file server.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_04
 We could always put more disks on...

0:27:09	SPEAKER_04
 It's the backup system, which is near saturation, apparently.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_10
 So, I think the file server could become an issue as we get a whole bunch more new compute machines and we've got, you know, 50 machines trying to access data off of that.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_04
 But we're all right for now because the network's so slow.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_07
 I think we've tried more, and someone said this is not reliable.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_07
 We were going to do it back to the...

0:27:36	SPEAKER_07
 What about putting the stuff on me?

0:27:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that was me.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_04
 I was the one who said it was not reliable. They were out.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, the...

0:27:45	SPEAKER_04
 But they're out just from sitting on the shelf?

0:27:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yep, absolutely.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_04
 Reading right don't hurt them too much unless you scratch them.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_04
 But the right ones and the read rights don't last.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_04
 So you don't want to put your un reproducible data on them.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_10
 We're out after what amount of time you're at two.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_09
 You're at two?

0:28:07	SPEAKER_07
 Wow.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_07
 But if that venue would...

0:28:10	SPEAKER_07
 Thank you, here much more, I'm planning about...

0:28:13	None
 Yeah.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_07
 They're awesome.

0:28:15	None
 I mean, yeah.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know many people who do it on CD.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, they're with the most...

0:28:20	SPEAKER_09
 All the LDC distributions are on CD, right?

0:28:22	SPEAKER_09
 They're on CD, but they're not...

0:28:24	SPEAKER_04
 That's not the only source. They have them on disk.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_04
 And they burn new ones every once in a while.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_04
 But if you go...

0:28:30	SPEAKER_08
 Or we have like 30, you know, from 10 years old?

0:28:32	SPEAKER_08
 No.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, 10 years old, 91.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_00
 And they're still all fine.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_08
 They're under where they press.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_08
 I both. I've burned them and they're still okay.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, you...

0:28:39	SPEAKER_04
 The last ones last for...

0:28:40	SPEAKER_04
 Well, not forever. They've been finding even those degrade.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, see.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_04
 But the burned ones...

0:28:44	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, when I say two or three years what I'm saying is that I have had disks which are gone in a year.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_04
 On the average, it'll probably be three or four years.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_04
 But you don't want to have your only copy on a media that fails.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_04
 And they do.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_04
 If you haven't professionally pressed, you know, they're good for decades.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_07
 So how about putting them on that plus, like, on that or some other media?

0:29:10	SPEAKER_04
 I think we can already put them on tape.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_04
 And the tape is very reliable.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_04
 So the only issue is then if we need access to them.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_04
 So that's fine if we don't need access to them.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_07
 Well, if they last say they actually last like five years.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_07
 And occasionally you might need to regrade one.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_07
 And then you get your tape on the other way or two.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_07
 And you just put them on.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_00
 So just archive it on the tape and then play them CDs one.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, so you're just saying put them on CDs for normal access.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, you can do that, but that's pretty annoying because the CDs are so slow.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_10
 Yeah.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_10
 It would be nice as a system that re-burned the CDs every year.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_10
 Every time it would.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_10
 The CDs are an obstacle.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_08
 Just before it goes bad.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_04
 The CD is an alternative to tape.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_04
 XC already has a perfectly good tape system and it's more reliable.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_04
 So for archiving, we'll just use tape.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_07
 I would think you're saying this.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_07
 If you have the data, if the meeting data is put on this exactly once.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_07
 And it's back that once and the backup system should never have to work with it.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_04
 Regardless, well, first of all, there was a problem with the archive in that I was every once in a while doing a Chimaud on all the directories, a recursive Chimaud and Chone because they weren't getting set correctly every once in a while.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_04
 And I was just doing a minus R star, not realizing that that caused it to be re-backed up.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_04
 But normally you're correct, but even without that, the backup system is becoming saturated.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_07
 But the backup system is smart enough to figure out that something hasn't changed.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_04
 Sure, but we still have enough changed that the nightly backups are starting to take too long.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_09
 I think at least the ones that you put it on.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_09
 It has nothing to do with the meeting.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_04
 It's just the general XC backup system is becoming saturated.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_07
 So what if we buy, what do they call this?

0:31:11	SPEAKER_04
 Why don't you have this conversation with Dave Johnson rather than with me?

0:31:15	SPEAKER_07
 Maybe something that we can do without involved in Dave and putting more work on that.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_07
 How about we buy one of these high density tape drives.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_07
 And we put the data actually on non-backed up disks.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_07
 And we do our own backup once and for all.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_04
 And then we don't have to embark on that.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_04
 Actually, you know, we could do that just with the tape, with the current tape.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_07
 I don't know what these tapes, at some point, I don't know what kind of tape I'm going to do.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know, but it's an automatic robot, so it's very convenient.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_04
 You just run a program to restore them.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_04
 The one that we have.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_09
 Am I going to fit with their backups?

0:31:47	SPEAKER_09
 No, we have something that isn't used by the backup gang.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_09
 Don't we have something downstairs?

0:31:54	SPEAKER_09
 Kind of tapes drive.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_04
 But Andreas' point is a good one.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_04
 And we don't have to do anything ourselves to do that.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_04
 They're already right now on tape.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_04
 So your point is, and I think it's a good one, that we could just get more disk and put it there.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_04
 That's not a bad idea.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah, that's basically what I was going to say is that disk is so cheap.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_09
 It's essentially close to free.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_09
 So one thing that costs is the backup issue into first order.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_09
 And we can take care of that by putting it on non-backed up drives and just backing it up once onto this thing.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_09
 I think that's a good idea.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah, good.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_08
 So who's going to do these backups?

0:32:32	SPEAKER_08
 The people that collect it?

0:32:33	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I'll talk to Dave and see what the best way of doing that is.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_04
 It's a little utility that will manually burn a tape for you.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_04
 And that's probably the right way to do it.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_10
 Yeah, and we should probably make that part of the procedure for reporting the meetings.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we're going to automate that.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_04
 My intention is to do a script that will do everything.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to have to take in the drive.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_04
 No, it's all tape or a lot.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_04
 So you just sit down at your computer and you type a command.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, but then you're effectively using the resources when the backup system was at a different time.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_08
 But not at the same time.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_10
 But you would be anyway.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_10
 Right?

0:33:08	SPEAKER_10
 No, he's saying get a whole different drive.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_04
 But there's no reason to do that.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we already have it there and it's.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_07
 And asking, can I use your tape for about, you will say, well, that's going to screw up our backup.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_07
 No, he won't.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_04
 He'll say, if that means that it's not going to be backed up standardly, great.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_09
 Dave has promoted this in the past.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah, it's definitely no problem.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_08
 What about if the times overlap with the normal backup time?

0:33:40	SPEAKER_04
 It's just a utility which queues up.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_04
 It just queues it up and when it's available, it will copy it.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_04
 And then you can tell it to then remove it from the disk or you can do it a few days later or whatever you want to do.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_04
 After you confirm that it's really backed up.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_04
 NW.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_04
 You're saying NW, okay?

0:33:59	SPEAKER_04
 NW archive, that's what it is.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_02
 And if you did that during the day, it would never make it to the library.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_07
 Well, you have to put the data on the non-life disk to the game, right?

0:34:13	SPEAKER_07
 Right.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_01
 So that otherwise you don't have to...

0:34:17	SPEAKER_01
 You can have a non-backed disk NWRI.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_04
 And then it never...

0:34:22	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_04
 Which I'm sure would make it.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_04
 The assessment's very happy.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_04
 So I think that's a good idea.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_04
 That's what we should do.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_04
 So that means we'll probably want to convert all those files, file systems to non-backed up media.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_10
 That sounds good.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_10
 Yeah.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_09
 Another thing on the agenda that says SRI recognition experience.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_09
 What was that?

0:34:43	SPEAKER_09
 Oh.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_09
 That wasn't me.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we have lots of them.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_07
 I didn't know you talked to you having the updates.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_10
 I'm successfully increasing the error rate.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_10
 That's good.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_10
 That's the hair value approach.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_08
 Yeah.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_10
 So I mean, I'm just playing with the number of Gaussian's that we use in the recognizer.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_07
 You have to set...

0:35:08	SPEAKER_07
 You have to type people that you're trying the tenant features.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_07
 Yes, I'm using tenant features.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_10
 Oh, you are?

0:35:13	SPEAKER_07
 Cool.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_07
 And I still take my work to the PLP features.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah, I got confused by the results because the meaning before you said, okay, we got it now and the way there...

0:35:22	SPEAKER_09
 That was on mail.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_09
 That was before I tried it on the females.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_09
 Oh.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_09
 It's the women of the problem.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_09
 Okay.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_08
 Well, let's just say that men are simple.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_08
 Hello.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_08
 Hello.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_08
 I had...

0:35:34	SPEAKER_02
 It was a quick response.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_02
 I'm well-rehearsed.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_07
 We had reached the point where the mail portion of the development set, one of the development sets, I think, that the mail error rate with the XCPRP features was pretty much identical with the SRI, which are the XCPRP.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_07
 So then I thought, oh, great.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_07
 I'll just let's make sure I think it works on the females and the error rate.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, there was a fee percent difference.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_08
 Is there less training data?

0:36:14	SPEAKER_08
 I mean, we don't...

0:36:15	SPEAKER_08
 This is more training data.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_08
 This is on just digits?

0:36:17	SPEAKER_08
 No, it's in a five.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, okay.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_07
 I'll probably be able to...

0:36:21	SPEAKER_07
 I'll be tested as a moment, sort of.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_07
 So then...

0:36:28	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, and plus the vocal track length organization didn't actually make things worse.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_07
 So it's happening to me seriously.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_07
 So...

0:36:37	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_07
 So...

0:36:39	SPEAKER_09
 But see, now between the males and the females, there's certainly a much bigger difference in the scaling range than there is, say, just within the males.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_09
 And what you're using before was scaling factors that were just from the SRI front end.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_09
 And that worked fine.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah.

0:37:02	SPEAKER_09
 But now you're looking over a larger range and it may not be so fine.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_07
 Well, so the one thing that I then tried was to put in the low pass filter, which we have in the...

0:37:17	SPEAKER_07
 So most...

0:37:18	SPEAKER_07
 Most have five systems actually band-limit at about 3700 hertz, although, you know, normally the channel goes to 4000, right?

0:37:29	SPEAKER_07
 So...

0:37:30	SPEAKER_07
 And that actually helped a little bit.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_07
 And it didn't hurt on the males, you know.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_07
 So... and I now try the...

0:37:44	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, and suddenly also the vocal track length organization only in the tests on the test data.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_07
 So you can do a vocal track length organization on the test data only or ongoing training in the test.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_07
 And you expect it to help a little bit if you do it only on the test and more if you do it on both training and...

0:38:00	SPEAKER_07
 Yes.

0:38:01	SPEAKER_07
 So it now helps you do it only on the test and I'm trying to retrain another set of models where it's both in the training and the test.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_07
 And then we will probably have hopefully a better one.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_07
 But it looks like there will still be some difference, maybe between one and two percent of the females.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_07
 And so, you know, I'm often doing suggestions.

0:38:24	SPEAKER_07
 And it is true that the...

0:38:26	SPEAKER_07
 You know, we are using the... but it can't be just the VTL because...

0:38:32	SPEAKER_07
 No, no, I'm not.

0:38:33	SPEAKER_07
 It's much worse, you know.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_07
 You know, the females are concerned with the reverse and the...

0:38:39	SPEAKER_07
 So that must be something else.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_08
 Well, what's the standard...

0:38:43	SPEAKER_08
 I thought the performance was actually a little better on females than males.

0:38:47	SPEAKER_08
 That's what I thought too.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_07
 That overall, yes, but on this particular development test, they're actually a little worse.

0:38:55	SPEAKER_07
 But that's beside the point we're looking at the discrepancy between the SRI system and the SRI system when training with each feature.

0:39:03	SPEAKER_08
 Right, I'm just wondering if that...

0:39:06	SPEAKER_08
 If you have any indication of your standard features, you know, if that's also different in the same direction or not.

0:39:12	SPEAKER_09
 Let me ask a more basic...

0:39:14	SPEAKER_09
 I mean, is this a iterative bound-multchtraining or is it a terribly training?

0:39:19	SPEAKER_07
 It's a lot of training.

0:39:21	SPEAKER_09
 And how do you determine when to stop iterating?

0:39:25	SPEAKER_07
 Well, actually, we just basically do a fixed number of iterations.

0:39:33	SPEAKER_07
 In this case, four.

0:39:36	SPEAKER_07
 Which we used to do only three and then we found out we can squeeze.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_07
 And it was basically...

0:39:43	SPEAKER_07
 We're keeping down the same side.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_07
 But you're right, it might be that one more iteration would help, but it's...

0:39:50	SPEAKER_09
 Or maybe you're doing one too many.

0:39:53	SPEAKER_07
 No, but this bound-multchtraining shouldn't be over there.

0:39:58	SPEAKER_09
 Well, there can be sure.

0:40:00	SPEAKER_09
 Well, you can try each one on a cross-order.

0:40:02	SPEAKER_09
 Some years ago, Bill Burndyla thing where he was looking at that and he showed that he could get it.

0:40:07	SPEAKER_09
 But...

0:40:10	SPEAKER_07
 Well, that's the easy one.

0:40:12	SPEAKER_07
 Because you've got all these immediate models.

0:40:15	SPEAKER_09
 In each case, how do you determine the usual fudge factors, the language scaling, acoustic scaling?

0:40:27	SPEAKER_07
 I'm actually re-optimizing them.

0:40:32	SPEAKER_07
 Although that hasn't shown to you.

0:40:35	SPEAKER_09
 Okay, and the question he was asking at one point about perning...

0:40:43	SPEAKER_09
 Remember that one?

0:40:46	SPEAKER_09
 It looked like the probability was getting out of PLP versus milk upstream.

0:40:51	SPEAKER_09
 They looked pretty different.

0:40:53	SPEAKER_10
 Yeah, the likelihood were lower.

0:40:55	SPEAKER_09
 And so there's the question.

0:40:57	SPEAKER_07
 For the PLP.

0:40:59	SPEAKER_07
 Did you see this in the SRI system?

0:41:01	SPEAKER_07
 Did this look into the log files?

0:41:03	SPEAKER_07
 Well, the likelihoods are...

0:41:05	SPEAKER_07
 You can't recognize them.

0:41:07	SPEAKER_07
 Because for every set of models, you compute a new normalization.

0:41:11	SPEAKER_07
 And so these log probabilities, they aren't directly...

0:41:15	SPEAKER_07
...you have the normalization cost of the average model in the trial.

0:41:19	SPEAKER_09
 But still, there's a question.

0:41:21	SPEAKER_09
 If you have some thresholds somewhere in terms of beam search or something?

0:41:24	SPEAKER_09
 Well, yeah, that's what I was wondering.

0:41:27	SPEAKER_10
 I mean, if you have one threshold that works well because the range of your likelihoods is in this area.

0:41:32	SPEAKER_07
 Very conservatively.

0:41:34	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, as we saw with the meeting that we could probably tighten the pruning without really...

0:41:40	SPEAKER_07
 So we basically have a very open view.

0:41:43	SPEAKER_09
 But you're only talking about a percent or two, right?

0:41:45	SPEAKER_09
 Here, we're saying that with this G, there's this difference here.

0:41:49	SPEAKER_09
 And see, because there could be lots of things, right?

0:41:52	SPEAKER_09
 But let's suppose just for a second that we've sort of taken out a lot of the major differences between the two.

0:42:03	SPEAKER_09
 I mean, we're already sort of using the male scale and using the same style filter integration.

0:42:08	SPEAKER_09
 And we're making sure that the low and high...

0:42:11	SPEAKER_07
 So for the PLP features, we used the triangular filter shapes and for the NDSRI front, we used the triple-modal ones.

0:42:18	SPEAKER_04
 And what's the top frequency of each?

0:42:21	SPEAKER_07
 Well, now it's the same. It's 30, 700...

0:42:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, one's triangular, one's trapezoidal.

0:42:26	SPEAKER_09
 So...

0:42:27	SPEAKER_09
 No, no, but...

0:42:28	SPEAKER_09
 Before, with straight PLP, it's trapezoidal, also, but then we had a slight difference in the scale.

0:42:35	SPEAKER_07
 So it's currently that the FICAD program doesn't allow me to change the filter shape independently of this.

0:42:41	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:42:42	SPEAKER_07
 I did the experiment on the NDSRI front, where I tried the...

0:42:45	SPEAKER_07
...with the standards to be the as trapezoidal purpose.

0:42:48	SPEAKER_07
 You can actually continuously vary between the two.

0:42:51	SPEAKER_07
 And so I...

0:42:52	SPEAKER_07
 That's what I'm trying to...

0:42:54	SPEAKER_07
 Trying to do what's...

0:42:55	SPEAKER_07
 And it did slightly worse, but it's really a small difference.

0:42:58	SPEAKER_09
 So...

0:42:59	SPEAKER_09
 A couple of tensor representations.

0:43:00	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so it's not just losing some frequency range.

0:43:03	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah. Right, so the other thing that...

0:43:07	SPEAKER_09
 So we've always viewed it anyway, is the major difference between the two is actually in the smoothing.

0:43:14	SPEAKER_09
 That the PLP and the reason PLP has been advantageous in slightly noisy situations is because PLP does the smoothing at the end by an aggressive model.

0:43:27	SPEAKER_09
 And Melcafstrom does it by just computing the lower test row coefficients.

0:43:32	SPEAKER_07
 Okay, so one thing I haven't done yet is to actually do all of this with a much larger with our full train set.

0:43:41	SPEAKER_07
 So right now we're using a...

0:43:44	SPEAKER_07
...40E.

0:43:48	SPEAKER_07
 It's a train set that's about...

0:43:53	SPEAKER_07
...my effective force model that we want to use when we train the fault system.

0:43:59	SPEAKER_07
 So some of these moving issues are overfitting for that matter.

0:44:02	SPEAKER_07
 And the long route should be much less of a factor if you go full-hog.

0:44:08	SPEAKER_07
 Good to be, yeah.

0:44:10	SPEAKER_07
 So the strategy is to first treat things with fast train around on the smoothing set.

0:44:17	SPEAKER_07
 And then when you've narrowed down, you've tried on a larger train set.

0:44:22	SPEAKER_07
 So we haven't done that yet.

0:44:23	SPEAKER_09
 Now the other great related question though is, is what's the boot models for these things?

0:44:29	SPEAKER_07
 The boot models are trained from scratch.

0:44:32	SPEAKER_07
 So we compute...

0:44:34	SPEAKER_07
 So we start with a...

0:44:38	SPEAKER_07
...alignment that we computed with sort of the best system we have.

0:44:44	SPEAKER_07
 And then we train from scratch.

0:44:47	SPEAKER_07
 We do...you know... we collect the...

0:44:53	SPEAKER_07
...observations from those linings under each of the future sets that we train.

0:44:59	SPEAKER_07
 And then from there we do...

0:45:02	SPEAKER_07
 There's a lot of actually the way it works.

0:45:04	SPEAKER_07
 The first train, the phonetically tight mixture model.

0:45:08	SPEAKER_07
 You do a total of...

0:45:10	SPEAKER_07
 First you do a context independence PTN model.

0:45:13	SPEAKER_07
 Then you switch to context...

0:45:15	SPEAKER_07
...and then you do two iterations of that.

0:45:18	SPEAKER_07
 Then you do two iterations of the context dependent, but actually the packet mixtures.

0:45:22	SPEAKER_07
 And then from that you go to a state custom model.

0:45:26	SPEAKER_07
 And you do four iterations of that.

0:45:28	SPEAKER_07
 So there's a lot of iterations overall between your original boot models and the final models.

0:45:33	SPEAKER_07
 I don't think that we have never seen big differences.

0:45:37	SPEAKER_07
 Once I thought, oh, I can...

0:45:39	SPEAKER_07
 Now I have these much better models.

0:45:41	SPEAKER_07
 I'll regenerate my initial alignments and I'll get much better models at the end.

0:45:44	SPEAKER_07
 That's what's right.

0:45:45	SPEAKER_07
 Right.

0:45:46	SPEAKER_09
 Well, making things better, yeah, but this...

0:45:49	SPEAKER_09
...for making things worse, that is possible.

0:45:53	SPEAKER_09
 Another possible partial cause is if the boot models use a different feature set.

0:46:00	SPEAKER_07
 But there are some boot models in fact.

0:46:02	SPEAKER_07
 You're not booting from initial models, you're booting from initial alignments.

0:46:05	SPEAKER_09
 What you got from a different feature set.

0:46:08	SPEAKER_07
 That's correct.

0:46:09	SPEAKER_09
 So those features look at the data differently actually.

0:46:12	SPEAKER_09
 I mean, you know, they will find boundaries a little differently.

0:46:15	SPEAKER_09
 You know, all that sort of thing is actually slightly different.

0:46:18	SPEAKER_09
 I'd expect it to be a minor effect.

0:46:21	SPEAKER_07
 So for a long time we had used boot alignments that had been trained with a same front end.

0:46:32	SPEAKER_07
 But with acoustic models that were like 15% worse than what we used now.

0:46:38	SPEAKER_07
 And with a different dictionary, with a considerably different dictionary, which was much less detailed and much less suited.

0:46:45	SPEAKER_07
 And so then we switched to new boot alignments, which now had the benefit of all these improvements that we've made over two years in the system.

0:46:53	SPEAKER_07
 Right.

0:46:54	SPEAKER_07
 And the result at the end was no different.

0:46:57	SPEAKER_07
 What I'm saying is the exact nature of these boot alignments is probably not a big factor in the quality of the final model.

0:47:05	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah, maybe not. But it's still see it as, I mean, there's a history of this too.

0:47:11	SPEAKER_09
 But I don't want to go into it.

0:47:13	SPEAKER_09
 But I think it could be the things that the data is being viewed in a certain way.

0:47:19	SPEAKER_09
 That a beginning is here rather than there and so forth because the actual signal processing is doing a slightly different.

0:47:26	SPEAKER_09
 But it's probably not it.

0:47:28	SPEAKER_07
 I should really reserve any conclusions until we've met it on the live trains and until we've seen results with the BTO training.

0:47:39	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah, at some point you also might want to take the same thing and try it on some broadcast news data or something else that actually has some noisy, noisy components.

0:47:48	SPEAKER_09
 So we can see if any conclusions would come to a halt across different data.

0:47:54	SPEAKER_09
 So something quick about absent.

0:47:59	SPEAKER_04
 Just what we were talking about before, which is that I hoarded a blast library to absent and then got it working with fast forward and got a speed up roughly proportional to the number of processors times the clock cycle.

0:48:11	SPEAKER_04
 So that's pretty good.

0:48:13	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, the process of doing it for quick net, but there's something going wrong and it's about half the speed that I was estimating it should be.

0:48:19	SPEAKER_04
 And I'm not sure why, but I'll keep working on it. But what it means is it's likely that for net training and forward passes will absent will be a good machine, especially if we get a few more processors and upgrade the processors.

0:48:33	SPEAKER_04
 There are five now. It can hold eight.

0:48:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we'll just go by and it's also 550 megahertz and you can get a gigahertz.

0:48:42	SPEAKER_07
 Can you fix the processors with different?

0:48:44	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think so. I think we'd have to do all.

0:48:46	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah, thank you for the box.

0:48:51	SPEAKER_07
 We can press.

0:48:54	SPEAKER_04
 We'd have to get a almost certainly have to get a netfinity server.

0:48:58	SPEAKER_04
 They're pretty, pretty specialized.

0:49:02	SPEAKER_09
 Okay. Is this going back?

0:49:05	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah. How are you doing?

0:49:08	SPEAKER_09
 All right.

0:49:12	SPEAKER_09
 All right. See you.

0:49:19	SPEAKER_09
 All right. So they're having T out there.

0:49:22	SPEAKER_09
 So I guess the other thing that we were going to talk about is demo.

0:49:26	SPEAKER_09
 And so these are the demos for the July meeting and July what?

0:49:37	SPEAKER_09
 Early July, late July? Oh, I think it's July 15.

0:49:42	SPEAKER_09
 16, 13. Yeah. So we talked about getting something together for that.

0:49:46	SPEAKER_09
 But maybe we'll just put that off for now given that.

0:49:51	SPEAKER_09
 But I think we should have a sub meeting.

0:49:54	SPEAKER_09
 I think probably Adam and Chuck and me should talk about.

0:50:00	SPEAKER_09
 Should get together and talk about that sometimes.

0:50:02	SPEAKER_09
 Over at Captain Chinatumar.

0:50:03	SPEAKER_09
 Yeah, something like that. Maybe we'll involve Daniel and some of us as well.

0:50:12	SPEAKER_09
 Okay. The T is going.

0:50:15	SPEAKER_09
 So I see just we do a unison.
