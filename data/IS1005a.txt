0:00:30	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, I'll go for the body.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_00
 I guess you all know what is it about? You all received the email, I guess. We are actually doing this meeting to start a new project, which is about designing remote control. So I'm going to be the project manager of this project and so I'm present myself. I'm Fabian Cardino and I guess you can present yourself.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know you can start. Okay, so my name is Petre Fossik, you can call me Petre here or Peter if you like. My name is Bob Marseille.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_02
 In the project, I'm supposed to be the technique. So my name is Bob Marseille.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_03
 I'm the marketing expert for this project. Bob.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, my name is Hamid Ketabdar and I'm going to be an interface designer in this project.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. So today we are doing a short meeting to present the project. So we are going to present the tool we are going to use during all this project. We are talking about the project plan and we are going to discuss about our first ideas and so on. So we have around 25 minutes to do this meeting. So what is the goal of this project is to design a new remote control. So it should be of course new and original and it should be 20 and user friendly.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_00
 That means it's a very challenging project and so we will try to do our best and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy. So what are we going to do during this project? So it's small like we are going to do individual work or in our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah and everything will be like this. So now we are going to get used to the tools. We are going to use all during all this project. So we can try to use the whiteboard here. So for example we can try to write what is our favorite animal and writes of our favorite characteristics about it.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_00
 So So I will ask you all to do the same, just to get used to the white box.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_02
 So I'm probably trying to draw the animal.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_02
 Well, you should have drawn the picture of the animal.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, go ahead.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so...

0:05:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, American.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_02
 How would you use the bird?

0:05:54	SPEAKER_02
 So I tried to sketch it out.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_02
 I had to first write it down because I'm not absolutely sure if I can draw it but...

0:06:08	SPEAKER_02
 Oh.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_02
 Can you recognize it?

0:06:16	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, go turn.

0:06:19	None
 So I think my favorite animal would be a cat.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_03
 Oh.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_03
 That's it's head.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_03
 I probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and playful.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_01
 The noise probably should go in the upstairs.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_04
 I'm sorry.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_03
 I'm sorry.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe put it on the desk or something.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_02
 I should get used to the tools.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_02
 Just wait a little bit.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_02
 Could we put it here?

0:07:35	SPEAKER_01
 I probably need to find a way to explain this.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_03
 You're a pale marker, thanks for a laugh.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_02
 Are you left handed?

0:07:48	SPEAKER_01
 Nope.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_01
 Should I clean?

0:07:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, I think like horses because they are strung and beautiful.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_01
 So if I want to write it here...

0:08:12	SPEAKER_04
 I think I can...

0:08:17	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it's better if you leave it.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, maybe we should just continue.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I don't worry about it.

0:08:27	None
 Oh, no.

0:08:34	None
 Okay.

0:08:41	None
 You can draw it.

0:08:48	None
 I don't know if I can.

0:08:55	None
 Okay.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_02
 You can draw it.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if I can.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_01
 Just try it.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_01
 It may be like a color.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not good, very good in drawing.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_01
 So this is very...

0:09:22	SPEAKER_01
 It's a bird, I think.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know what is it.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's clean.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_01
 It's good.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_01
 I'm shameful.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_01
 It's okay.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_02
 It's good.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_02
 It's in the beautiful.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_03
 I'm strong.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not strong enough.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_00
 So good.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_00
 So let's talk about Monet.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_00
 We are going to sell...

0:10:18	SPEAKER_00
 We want to sell this remote control for 25 euros.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_00
 And our expected profit will be around 50 million euros.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_00
 And we are trying to have a market all around the world.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_00
 So notice not only for Switzerland, but for the world.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_00
 So we expect a production cost of maximum 12.50 euros.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_02
 Per unit, I guess.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, of course.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_00
 So we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do, what are our experiments with remote control and any idea.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_00
 So if you have some experience good or bad with remote control, you can share it and say what is your idea or anything.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_03
 Well, from experience, I've had remote controls in the past that I've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_03
 And it's been very hard to use because there's so many buttons.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_03
 And it's very hard to see which buttons do what.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_03
 And the buttons are very small and very hard to press.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_03
 And normally you only ever use...

0:11:59	SPEAKER_03
 On a TV remote, you only ever use mostly four or six buttons.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_03
 So it's frustrated me in the past.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, I have also some points, maybe two points.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_02
 First would be that in current remote control, there's no big light.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_02
 So if you're playing with this in the dark room, it's probably worse to have something like a big light.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_02
 And maybe it could be also dependent on the amount of light in the room.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_02
 So that if it's in the day, it doesn't need to be big light.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_02
 It's because it works on the battery.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_02
 So something like this.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_02
 And the second thing, the second point for me, would be that in normal remote controls, there are two buttons for volume control.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_02
 But I prefer like a potentiometer or something like...

0:13:03	SPEAKER_03
 Ah, okay.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_02
 You know, some slider.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_02
 Not just two discrete buttons for volume, but something which...

0:13:11	SPEAKER_03
 Is that because of the discrete volume levels?

0:13:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but I can reach in a one second, I can mute it down.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not afraid that if you take your remote control, you can move the slide and the volume can grow very quickly.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_02
 If it drops to the floor, then it passes through.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, when you take the remote control, for example, on the table, you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_02
 You have a loud sound.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_02
 It depends what you feel about that.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we can think of these things afterwards, but if matter, you have some loud sound.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, just a simple experience.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_01
 I prefer remote control working with radio waves because remote control working with infrared wave, you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it...

0:14:16	SPEAKER_01
 Without a few corners.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_00
 Let's continue.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_00
 I have a meeting in five minutes, so...

0:14:29	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, you should hurry.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_00
 So, we will close this meeting.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_00
 So, we will have a next meeting in 30 minutes.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_00
 So, I will ask you to do some work.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_00
 The interface developer will work on the design of the remote control and start to have new ID.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_02
 Which is how met with the bug case?

0:15:06	SPEAKER_03
 Is the industrial designer?

0:15:08	SPEAKER_02
 No, you are the industrial designer.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_03
 I am the technical designer.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think that's the first deal.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_03
 The ID, industrial designer.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_02
 And the second one is the user interface designer.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_03
 And then the last one is marketing, which is me.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_00
 So, for the user interface designer, which is a met, you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_00
 And for the marketing manager, which is Bob, you are going to try to find the user requirements for the remote control.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_00
 You will receive by email the specific instructions and by your personal coach.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_00
 So, I see you in 30 minutes.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_00
 Great, okay.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_00
 Thanks guys.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_00
 Bye.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_00
 Let's go back to the real work.

0:16:48	None
 Thank you.
