0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 Played out. Played out as edible. Did you know that? It's definitely because kids. I

0:00:08	SPEAKER_03
 just do. Definitely eating it before I had it not less. Yeah. But it's it's my edible because

0:00:15	SPEAKER_01
 yeah it's my edible because kids eat it. Yeah. If it wasn't edible then well no more

0:00:22	SPEAKER_03
 better. I still make sense because I remember like I don't know if my mom ever did it. I remember other people's mom's making I come in and played over. You just like make the baby's coloring and mix. Oh yeah it is. Yeah.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_02
 But everybody everybody ready? Yep. Okay let's have your um. Let's get guys have the

0:00:53	SPEAKER_03
 presentation. Pretty exciting. So everything that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber. Very simple and easy to use. Double curved. Yeah double curved. But also something that was going to jump out at people or something that would be different uh separate it from the other. Remote's out on the market. So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand you'll see what a nice thing we have going here. That is cool. So basically if you hold it like that the one on your thumb. Yeah the thumb button is the power button.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_03
 Index finger is channel up. Middle finger is channel down. Ring finger is volume up.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_03
 The pinky is volume down. What's the big blue thing? That's the lock button.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_03
 Oh cool. And then the M is a mute button. And then it also has plus I said what button M for muting. Oh mute. And also there's an numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the channel if you want. So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different that's what it does. So all the I mean the important keys are right at your you know right at a convenient place for you to access them. So you don't keep empty R S O. Yeah it should be and it's also conformable to the size of your hand. I mean if that's too big it's a rubber rubber you can. It's great. It's so cute. Is that what mesh with what you guys are hoping

0:02:46	SPEAKER_02
 with and for expecting one. I have one thing about it but it's a small thing but it means we'd have to make a white handed one and a left handed one. I like it. That's good thinking.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_02
 But I don't see why that's not possible. If we build rocket ships I can't even build a

0:03:06	SPEAKER_03
 left handed one. Yeah. I might left handed scissors. Yeah I didn't think about that but yeah.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_01
 But then you can learn to use your right hand. Like I was thinking there's left handers and right handers in the family. What do they have to remote? I know people who have left handed and right

0:03:28	SPEAKER_00
 handers. People in the family and they all use the computer for the same computer for the first

0:03:34	SPEAKER_01
 family and they have an X. Sure. Everybody using right handed. Yeah. I'm sure they'll be able to. I mean it's only pressing buttons. You don't have to do anything you know, extraordinary. I think everybody can press a button with their left hand or right hand. So imagine are you right handers?

0:03:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. Imagine doing it with your left hand. I don't think it's too big.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. But we can have both. Yeah. Have them in stock. Yeah. Yeah. Make them more appealing.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_02
 But I'm other than that. I only know and that's something you know, that's just something I think.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's great. Yeah. Great idea. Do you think it says all right? I think it says.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's well if the RR motto is we bring fashion to electronics. I'd say that could be quite

0:04:27	SPEAKER_03
 fashionable. Yeah. And it's got the black and yellow and blue plus red which is sort of a fruit and vegetable.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_02
 So that's our inner things. Yeah. Yeah. It's come up with what you know, the thing that's what we were looking at doing, isn't it? And it all seems to be there. Well done.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_01
 We're all playing around. Before we move on. Yeah. I'm just doing a bugging. I need that cable.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you. Yeah. One thing I do need to look at is the costs.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_02
 The costs, isn't it? The costs. Well, yeah. I don't want to last very long. Everybody will go like,

0:05:23	SPEAKER_01
 oops, it's gone. But it's edible. Cheap. Well, buy more than the heat. That was the main criteria

0:05:34	SPEAKER_02
 for my last meeting. It had to be cheap proof. Yeah. Right. Okay. Now I think we'll do this. I could do, you know, I can do this. Oh, oh. Oh, man. I could do it with you. But it's just easy enough to go through it with you. So we're going for the kinesic power. And the electronics we decided on it being just a simple, the easiest thing that's inside it.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_02
 The case we've gone for the double curved.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_02
 And it's made out of rubber. The interface is push buttons.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_02
 And buttons, supplements. Well, they're special colors, aren't they? Yeah.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_02
 So special colors. Special form. Yeah, they're special form. They're in shapes and stuff.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. These ones on the side are curved to kind of stuff.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_02
 They're made out of any special material. No, they're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber anything. They're just simple. Well, they're rubber. Okay.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_02
 So let's see if that comes within budget. And it does. That's going to cost. Yeah, that's going to cost 10, 10 euro, 70 cents a unit. And I'll tell you it was it has come in

0:07:18	SPEAKER_03
 at under 1250. Yeah. So I'm actually making a better profit when I'm expecting this is all

0:07:25	SPEAKER_02
 very, very good. The bosses will be very pleased. Okay, let's just say this so I can imagine. So it's very tiny. No, at least say any other, my documents.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_02
 Splendid. Okay.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_02
 So that's messed me down with this, with this do that.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_02
 Go and do what you were going to do.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_01
 No evaluation. Oh yeah. This is where we all get to.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_01
 I get to write them. Oops. Right. Oh.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_02
 I love this, my player. I can't, I can't spell it.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. So evaluation. We're going to do it all together. So we evaluate it each criteria.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_01
 I've got the criteria. And we have to do it on a scale of 1 to 7, 1 being true. So it's, it's more like it fits the criteria and 7 being as in it doesn't fit the criteria.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_01
 And the criteria is lower and I'll draw this up on the board. So we have a box.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_01
 Just so we know true. And this is false. This is just like keep you informed. So 7 is here.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_01
 And once here and then you've got in the middle. So the first criteria, do you all get what we're doing?

0:09:44	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. Okay. First criteria, look and feel. So it does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about as it is it color wise and is it spongy. So what mark should we give it?

0:09:57	SPEAKER_01
 I would give it a 7. Yeah. As in it's not. Oh, sorry. Oh, sorry. One. Yeah. So I'll just write criteria.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_01
 Second criteria, new technology. How we implemented new technology was in the new high tech.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. That was our main technological innovation.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_03
 It's really simple but the fact that we use the kinetic energy.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_03
 So the, um, it's ergonomic. Yeah, but that's not a technical thing. That's another thing.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_02
 That's another marketing thing. So on the technical side of it, I'll say it's about a twist.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_03
 In the middle somewhere maybe. Yeah.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So criteria three is easy to use. I think it's the one I'd say it's,

0:10:53	SPEAKER_02
 I've not, if you're left handed, it's not. I would give it a, I would give it a two. Two. Two. Six. Because it is, it is more geared for right handed people than left handed people.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_01
 But if we make a right handed and left handed, then

0:11:07	SPEAKER_03
 if we're going to have one left handed, one right handed, then I would give it a one.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. Give it a two. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Criteria four is costs.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, under budget. Yeah. It's a definite one. That was great. Mount the buttons. Like the amount of buttons because people like

0:11:34	SPEAKER_01
 only the necessary buttons. So it's one. Yeah. Yeah. Criteria six. Isis are good against. Yes.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_01
 N-T-R-S-I. It's one.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_01
 And Criteria seven, which is the last one, does it get lost? Is it easy to get lost?

0:11:52	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it's going to get lost very easily. No, but it is small.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_03
 It's not the kind of thing that's going to slip like between a couch cushion or something.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_03
 I think it would get lost.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_01
 We were two. Yeah. I mean, it's not fully like, can't say, I mean, it's not a one.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, you can still flush it down a toilet theoretically.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. I mean, it's bigger than the average mobile, I guess.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. But yeah, it can be lost. The mobiles get lost all the time.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 But then you ring them.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_01
 Find them.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. Yeah. So that's that.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 That's the evaluation. So I'd say.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. All right. It's like an old system.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_01
 Like a number one.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_01
 Number one product.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, we can't fail.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_01
 We've fitted all the criteria.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_02
 Well done, Risa.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_02
 That's that one. Okay. I think I just want to put in as project manager.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_02
 There's, you know, a little bit of praise for everybody here.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_02
 They had a work, don't they? You know, both individually and as a team.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_02
 You know, everyone's come up with their own individual ideas and their own different departments.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_02
 And then come together and works in, you know, integrity, you know, at the right times, you know, especially you too.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_02
 That's all, you know, gone very, very well and and, and, you know, it's been good communication going on.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, during our design and there was some, some heated, heated discussion, but we kept, we tried to keep it cool.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_02
 Did you have to go down to the corporate squash court and bash a few bills about?

0:13:59	SPEAKER_03
 We just had to, we just had to squeeze our product a little bit.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_03
 Fantastic. Now, you guys have been a great team.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_03
 I think we're the, we're the envy of all the other teams.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_02
 I think so, I, you know, I think we've got, we have, we've come up with something new.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_02
 Something that hasn't been done before. We're not just rehashing in our design.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_01
 In four, and four meetings.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_01
 From your design and meetings could be this quick.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_02
 You know, maybe this isn't a simulation.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe this is actually a, it's like, I think they're so neat or someone like that.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_02
 They're just, yeah.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, well, two years time, this will be on the market.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly that product.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_02
 We'll go, yeah, we design that. I know I'm a believer.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_03
 So at this stage, I mean, is this the last meeting of the project?

0:14:58	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have another one after it's gone.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_02
 No, I think when this meeting's finished, like officially, they'll get a question there.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, really?

0:15:07	SPEAKER_02
 To fill in.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_02
 Or six.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_01
 Just not summarizing now.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_01
 I couldn't apply to the same list.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_02
 I've got the message.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_01
 See some way.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_01
 We just reported that.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_03
 So there's no way to like predict what our, because we had it, we originally had it as far as our financial goals.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_03
 We had a specific number for profits that we wanted.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_03
 It was 50, no, 15, was it 50 or five?

0:15:42	SPEAKER_03
 I don't remember, but there's not a way to compete that.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, since we saved on that production cast, do we know how much we're making on profit?

0:15:51	SPEAKER_02
 It gets handed over to another department.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_02
 Well, what our project was was to come up with the product, basically.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_02
 And just basically is it can, is it within budget?

0:16:04	SPEAKER_02
 When it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and the profits and all that, that's other departments.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_02
 It's another team that actually work out the mate that we have invested in.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_02
 Oh yeah, the old one goes in the profit sharing.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's it.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_02
 You know, we've made, we've designed the product.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_02
 We've got the prototype.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_02
 It's within budget.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_02
 It does everything that we wanted it to do.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_02
 It's new.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_02
 It's something that is now there already.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_03
 I think actually in one advantage of this is that after this bad of fruit and vegetables passes, this will still be a cool remote.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_03
 We're not tying our card to that one more.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_02
 But this is very remarkable.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_02
 And that it is, it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people to want that.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_02
 It's, it's, I'm going to write it down here somewhere.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I put it in one of my emails that I've sent off.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_02
 It's remarkable in the sense that it's whilst all these other emotes actually do give you a Pestus strain injury.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_02
 Our one does the complete opposite.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_02
 So that's something that's new, which is one of the criteria they ask just to come up with something new.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_03
 It makes watching TV healthy.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and if you're not having a good time with a TV, you can throw it about.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_02
 It's fine.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_02
 It's kid proof.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_01
 Just, just throw it at any of the ornaments and break them.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_02
 Well, you can break the ornaments, but you won't break that.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_02
 So all in all, I think we've done very well.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_02
 Well done, everybody.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_02
 Drinks are on the company.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_02
 In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool, on the top floor that we've all just gained access to.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_02
 That's a good idea, that.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:24	None
 That's it.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_02
 Well, as far as I know.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_01
 We haven't got the five minutes left thing yet.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_02
 You want to play ice-bye?

0:18:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_03
 I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up in half, five minutes of silence.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_03
 Should we call it a day now?

0:18:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I guess.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, we're going to get asked to fill out another question there.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_02
 It's probably going to be the same as one we've done before.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not the authority to say that it is.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_02
 How does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this?

0:19:22	SPEAKER_02
 Using the pens and writing on these special pads and all that?

0:19:27	SPEAKER_02
 I love it.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_01
 I love it.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's cool.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not wired up.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know, vibrating pen.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_01
 Cool.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_01
 Being watched.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_03
 Your moment to show you.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_02
 Well.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_02
 I'd, you know, I'd, yeah, as we said earlier, I've not never seen that before.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, something that's whiteboard.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_02
 Thingy.

0:20:06	None
 That's great.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_02
 But a pen with a camera on it, I don't think it's such a new thing.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_02
 Or it's such a new idea.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_02
 It would be different if it was sort of, and writing, recognising stuff.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_02
 But as it's not, it's literally that will come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than a actual text.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_03
 Right. I think they do want to get in there.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_01
 It's just the first step.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_03
 The most important step.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_03
 I guess we should end this as well.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_03
 Ah, public.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.
