0:00:00	None
..

0:00:20	None
 Oops..

0:00:20	SPEAKER_00
..

0:00:22	SPEAKER_04
..

0:00:24	SPEAKER_04
..

0:00:28	None
..

0:00:29	SPEAKER_00
 Did we get a sound out of time for the other one?

0:00:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it's going to give them a ride.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, OK.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_00
 Excellent.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_04
 So how are we getting along?

0:01:46	SPEAKER_00
 One thing that I was wondering, is there standard control that you use to connect the different things like you're in the topic and it goes and highlights the topic in the text or whatever.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_00
 Is there a particular type of control that like is one of these NXT or sorry?

0:02:04	SPEAKER_01
 I think there is.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_01
 Just because the topic box and all this is based on what was it called?

0:02:16	SPEAKER_01
 Nom, no, night, text area or something?

0:02:20	SPEAKER_01
 It has some sort of highlighting stuff there.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if it's inbuilt.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_00
 You haven't had to build any new windows to do that sort of thing like other topics or what we're going to do for speaker, I guess.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_00
 Can we talk about speaker characterization? How are we accessing the list of speakers?

0:02:53	SPEAKER_04
 I want to talk about that actually.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_04
 They speak on data processing is fine, but I would like to keep on to do the the the GUI for it.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_01
 You don't.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_01
 If you want to do that.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I was thinking about.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_04
 Tell me how you want the data presented.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to tell you at the moment, I've created two classes, one that represents the meetings and the information about both is contained within each object.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_04
 So, and then they write objects and the objects contain all the information about the meetings and the speakers.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_04
 So, the speakers that are at the meetings and the amount they speak and then the average is contained with the speakers.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_04
 So, there's two separate classes.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_04
 OK, yeah, and they're two different objects and you can recall they can write the rights, the objects and then you call the objects back and they have those returned objects have all the information that they need and then you can call methods to return whatever you want.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_04
 OK, yeah, I see what you mean or everything, but that's what I wanted to know how what's the easiest way to have the data.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_01
 So, I have you already calculated the list data. What are you supposed to do that?

0:03:58	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, basically all kinds of things.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_04
 And all storage objects.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_04
 So, object.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_04
 All right, which means that you just would call the and our null construction call the load.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_04
 And you can call it that and you can call it a list of the one more and back to everything or whatever you want to do.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_04
 And then we'll just call it one at a time to pop that window.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_04
 But that's what I wanted to know how what format do you want the data to come back in.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_04
 Because it can come back as, what's the.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_04
 What should it come back as?

0:04:26	SPEAKER_00
 When he was talking about like have an architecture that things are going to plug into.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I mean, so the things are all modular. I mean, it would be good idea for use that same idea for anything else.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_00
 What else are we doing?

0:04:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, even the searches or whatever.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you can't.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_00
 Any sort of thing. I mean search results if they're all in a predictable thing with a name certain properties or list of properties.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_04
 So.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_04
 The main data structures are hash tables for the meetings that say it's got one that says percent is called percent talk.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_04
 Once percent noise and one is percent participation.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_04
 So then it's got inside. It's got a link. It's got a it's got the speaker's name.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_04
 And then it's got their percentage for that thing.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_04
 So it can either come back as a you can have the hash table or you can have it returned as a vector and it will say noise.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_04
 It's just a strings noise.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_04
 Ex percent will say a vector that's cool.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know. Whatever. You can either have it.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_04
 You can even have it.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_04
 You could have a life embedded of the individual array of strings and each one represents one person or whatever.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_04
 What are the easiest things to do?

0:05:39	SPEAKER_01
 Whatever you give me, I can do it.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_00
 It's just a matter of deciding what we want to use. Yeah.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_00
 All the way around.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_01
 So what we'll whenever we open a window for one speaker.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_04
 See, that's the kid. How did we.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_04
 Can I have a good idea?

0:06:06	SPEAKER_04
 If it's in that format, it's speaker.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_04
 It's speaker. Speakers will be controlled.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_04
 Thing not.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_04
 So all of this, all that's calculated as well.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_04
 So the speaker objects.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, is it?

0:06:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. That's easy.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_04
 So I'm quite amusing, actually.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_04
 The influences are lived in Germany for six months.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know if that had any effect. I spent too much time talking to Brits.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_05
 I'm always a sub-bizarre thing.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_05
 They weren't any people government.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_04
 So then all that's calculated as well.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_04
 All I have to do is get the dialogue.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_04
 So I don't even have the difficulty.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_04
 So then there's this, how is this box populated?

0:06:56	SPEAKER_04
 Is it populated by the one present or the one highlighted?

0:07:00	SPEAKER_01
 Learn the one present.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_01
 Well, then we could do them one highlighted, I suppose.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_04
 Because at the moment, there are methods that say, for the file using for other types of present, it says, get, get talk time.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_04
 And you take the name.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_04
 So that would call that.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_04
 We call the meetings method that said return.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_04
 That would populate that, which would be an easy meeting.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_04
 And you're saying for that.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_01
 That would be implementing what you said that you want to see per topic.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_01
 You want to see which one spoken mouse, something like that.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_01
 So you could zap through these topics.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_01
 Meetings.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_01
 Meeting, sorry.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_01
 And it would come up with how much they spoke and you can pick the one that looks the most.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. That would be easy as well.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, OK.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_04
 So I'll just leave in lots of methods that just return one number.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_01
 It would be the easiest way to do it.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, definitely.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's fine.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_01
 So, yeah, random things like return, talking time.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_04
 Get talk time if you could speak.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_01
 Good.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_00
 So each time you're going straight to the XML files for the information.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_00
 No, it's still as an object file.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_00
 It's all offline.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_00
 It's still as an object.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_00
 OK.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_04
 And then they're much, much smaller than only a little one.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_04
 One, OK.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_00
 So that's all.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_00
 Just pre-processed.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_04
 So it's just, each one of the objects got a bunch of the term methods.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_04
 You have to recreate the object.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_04
 It's got a load method.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_04
 So what you do is you call a null constructor.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_04
 Because if you call a proper constructor for each meeting, it goes off and does all the processing and stores a zone object.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_04
 And then if you call a null constructor, then you call load and you can call load on whatever one or all of the more.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_00
 Because it's for the entire corpus.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_00
 Or is it just like individual ones, like one object for each meeting?

0:08:54	SPEAKER_00
 I want each meeting, OK.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_00
 Well, yeah.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_00
 I wonder if that would be useful for some of the other stuff we're doing.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_04
 It just tells you who participated at the moment.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_04
 It tells you who participated in the amounts they participated in percentages.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_04
 And in time as well.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_01
 Can you put in what topic was spoken about as well?

0:09:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_01
 I could use that for the topic.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_01
 Pop up the window.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_04
 That would be, that would cause a problem with anything that wasn't on the 30th topic.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_01
 That wasn't what.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_00
 Or just return a null or a blank or a blank.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_04
 No topic specified.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_04
 I do have a default.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_04
 There are some, there are some default.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_04
 No, it's actually not.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_01
 Because at the moment, if you right click on the topic window and one of the topics, you have the option of popping open a window, which gives you a list of all the meetings containing that topic.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_04
 So.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_04
 So, I'm going to go over the meeting over the objects because that's the thing.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_04
 These, these are so small that it can load each, all of the whole lot up and do a search over the whole lot to find who bothers me anymore. No problem or what topics were in what.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_01
 So it doesn't crash the thing.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_01
 So how, how would you, how would you calculate that?

0:10:05	SPEAKER_01
 Would you do the summarization as you populate it?

0:10:09	SPEAKER_01
 What, you're able to stick, come straight up.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we've got.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_04
 Because they're just for the meeting.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_04
 Meet the, the.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_01
 So, so that, that is all stored together.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_04
 The speaker class knows about all of that stuff. All right.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_02
 And the meeting class knows about.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:10:22	None
 Sounds good.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_01
 So have you done these yet?

0:10:26	SPEAKER_01
 No, no.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_04
 You just got to decide on what we want to.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_01
 What we want.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_04
 I thought the other stuff was more important.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_04
 So it's all, all usable now.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_01
 Can I do it tonight?

0:10:40	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_04
 Design the game first.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_04
 The problem is if you change the classes, the objects serial numbers change and you can't reload the objects.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_04
 So all the processing has to be done over again and haven't quite finished a bit.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_04
 So it would become out of sync.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_04
 And get a bit funny.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_04
 If I gave you one, if I gave you it now and you worked on it and then I changed it and run the thing again, you would never be able to load the objects.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, I see.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_04
 And then you'd have multiple copies of objects where you'd go to and get.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_01
 Well, let me know when it's sort of usable.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_04
 But if you want to make the picture, you can do that without anything.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_01
 What do you mean a picture?

0:11:21	SPEAKER_01
 Just the, just the.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but it's not going to take quite a bit.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_04
 Why I went to go in to get it.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_04
 But only I'll need to have done all this stuff too.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_01
 So where's that?

0:11:43	SPEAKER_01
 Is that stored in the.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_04
 That is some white hound direction.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_01
 On your own directory.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_04
 Not in the.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_04
 Wait, it's finished up.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_04
 Actually, I cannot plug myself as well.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_00
 I just have to make one change to your file just to load this one instead of the default.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_00
 So two lines of code.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_01
 What are you wanting to write that indirectly or what?

0:12:09	SPEAKER_01
 What do you want to do?

0:12:10	SPEAKER_01
 What do you mean?

0:12:11	SPEAKER_01
 If you want to change my code.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_00
 Well, yeah, just the one thing that's like the action for loading up this.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_01
 But do you want to change that the original and brother file and all?

0:12:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_00
 Well, your version.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_01
 Have you done that now?

0:12:23	SPEAKER_00
 No, I do it in my directory.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_00
 Just.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, okay.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_01
 So not the actual one, but a copy of it.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_00
 I have a copy.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_00
 So, yeah, I was going to update that one.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_00
 Just, yeah, it just makes sense that.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 Well, just just tell me when because I usually I usually work on my own copy.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_01
 And then update all the day and then update it without checking if it's the one in the show.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I haven't made any changes to it.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_00
 Y'all just make that one.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_00
 Like I said, two lines of code.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_00
 And then you can play.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_00
 There's not much to do.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_00
 Have to get better results.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_00
 Like better.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_01
 So, is that what you're working on now that to represent results?

0:13:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 And just to wiring the topics and do it on some ways.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_00
 So.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_00
 You mean the highlighting stuff?

0:13:18	SPEAKER_00
 Well, also, yeah, like that, that as well.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_00
 So, you know, some dish wanna find what kind of objects that was were that.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_00
 For the other ones.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_00
 So, I think all of them in highlights.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_00
 Cause that's.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_01
 I know.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_01
 Actually for an N-text area, whatever it is, they define some handy highlights on that.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_01
 So, you've got different highlights.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_01
 You've got just look at what they wrote about it.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_01
 They've got like user highlights, selection highlights, time highlights.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_01
 So, yes.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_01
 So, you can quite easily, if your text area is called area, you just do area dot set highlights or something.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_01
 That's the way I did it to highlight, to cross highlight between topic and transcripts.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_00
 Sounds good.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_00
 So, there's a few more things to do with that.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_00
 So, once we get to the index, then that's gonna be kind of fun.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just wondering if you had to, well, the way you're doing it, I was gonna ask if the way you were doing it, you were loading like a new corpus each time for each meeting, but you're doing the object.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_00
 So, you don't need to.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_00
 Just, cause if we do have like the inverted search, says if there's the on 10 documents or we're gonna have to load each of these 10 corpora, just to do the individual next, the next T-search.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_04
 That way it doesn't crash, you try and load all 10 in one, it crashes with it.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_00
 Probably.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_04
 It's a bit dumb if you can fool it, if you load up 10 different engines so, simultaneously, it can do that.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_04
 I'm so serious.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_04
 I can't do them, can't do them if it thinks anyone, cause it's about the amount that each, you have to kind of call a new class and then it will do it fine.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_04
 Alright, I like how it's more dense and small.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it says, okay, oh yeah, I've got all this both, you've got it so.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_05
 Otherwise it goes, oh no.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_01
 It talks, you know.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_01
 It talks to you.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_05
 It's a nice machine.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_01
 You've spent too much time.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_01
 I think.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_01
 Alright, well I've been doing some random pop-up windows for the speaker characterization, which is good, so I feel that in now.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_01
 The windows are all there now, after.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_01
 Lots of really.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, they're done, are they?

0:15:43	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you know, just the pop-up window.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_01
 No pop-up.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_01
 It was difficult, yeah.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_01
 Because it basically has to set up, like, whatever, ten pop-up windows in memory, as in, already, initialize them, because there might be ten speakers.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_01
 Now, they all have to have different windows in.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_01
 And I'm working on, when you click on a topic to see a list of the topics of the meetings that that topic was mentioned.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_01
 And I have a question about the, we said we wanted to start screen.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_01
 What kind of start screen do we want?

0:16:25	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, do we want some general blurb about welcome to the browser or something?

0:16:30	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I did more well as D browser.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_05
 Some speeches of music.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_05
 So, I'm going to go over the screen.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_00
 It's animation back to you.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_00
 We have to, you know, while we're debugging.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_00
 But, you know, or something that just sort of guides them to the most obvious things.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_01
 So, do we want, yeah, maybe we could write on, like, the, what is it called?

0:16:54	SPEAKER_01
 The top of the window saying welcome to the meeting browser.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_04
 Or a switchboard that comes up that's just a blank form like that with some buttons.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_04
 Load me a meeting, load me a search, load me something else.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_01
 But how?

0:17:10	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, at the moment, the way is it's a drop-down menu, as you've seen.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_01
 With all the, and that, because it's the dialogue class that you use there.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_00
 I was just going to ask if we should assume that they'll want to load a meeting first, but not necessarily.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_00
 I guess we'll be doing a search on a diagram.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I think they should have two options.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe they load up a meeting that they choose or do a search.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_04
 And for that, once you've got the results, you click on something and now I've got to take it down.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_04
 So, stupid that I've just, it would lead you to have a meeting loaded before it will start doing any search.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_00
 Oh.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we can put the logic in there.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_00
 Oh.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_04
 You can't, the only thing is search is a night object model and the only time you get one of those is if you load it in observation.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_00
 I could probably even, that shouldn't be too hard to put a check in there.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_00
 And if it hasn't loaded, then it'll force them to load one.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't, that would, you could use the inverted file search to return a list of meetings and then use one of those to load a search.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_04
 But you won't.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_01
 Can you not get this non object?

0:18:12	SPEAKER_04
 It has to be an observation.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_04
 And even if you go and you can go and search the whole corpus from that, but you have to have, you have to start with something for some bizarre reason.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_04
 The engine, there's only one, there's only one search method to the search engine.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_04
 The engine class only has one.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_01
 I suppose we wouldn't want to use, yeah, we wouldn't want to use NXT at the beginning anyway, because we don't want to search locally.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_00
 So, so let's say, Unless you know what meeting it is.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_01
 Well, yeah.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_01
 Well, then they would open the meeting first, right?

0:18:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_01
 So let's say they have two options, either pick one meeting or search globally to find a meeting that they like.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_00
 Or, well, the things I made just be looking for a word, you know, like, it shows up 10 different meetings.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_00
 Then at that point, they'll probably want to, like, do we want to, like, if the dot by default goes with the first one and they want number five of the ones that are returned to me, then they'll go through the.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_01
 Why do we want default?

0:19:10	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, just, well, no, like, to load up, like, the thing is, I think, like, when it loads up, it'll load up the transcript window and the, whatever, the window.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_00
 I think just the topic one.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_00
 Although the time is probably more caused by loading the actual data.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm just thinking if it's kind of, like, you were saying you have to have a non-object.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, before you do.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_00
 I'll search it all.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but local search.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_01
 We can do local search.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't take long to load up anyway.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_04
 We can light it down one up.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't have any.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but the, okay, the global one feeds into the local.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I mean, the local data, it's going to be doing a search on each of those files.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_00
 So it's going to be loading up each of those at a time to get the data.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the global.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_01
 Invert a file search gives the norm objects, basically, to the local search.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, right.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_00
 But it could be time consuming, like, if there are 10 documents that.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's always going to be the case with search.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_04
 But it gives one at a time anyway.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_00
 So it's going to be a little bit easier.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I'm just thinking of some way we could, you know, cash the results and, you know, nice little format that'll make things a bit easier.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_00
 But the thing is, I mean, if we've got that, then it's going to be needing really not really to load the entire corpus for that meeting.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_00
 If it's trying to show us where those were, if it's trying to highlight those in the text, transcript, whatever.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_00
 And we're going to have to have all that other data.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_00
 So we're going to have a search window and we have, like, you know, 10 different meetings, you know, the word wireless comes up, go to meeting one and has to reload the norm object.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_00
 Next one.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, that's going to.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's not too slow though.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_00
 That thing is not too bad on that.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_04
 That thing that would be a team was.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_00
 It always seems to be slow loading up the first time, at least.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_00
 Like, that's all.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_00
 Lightly is just sort of loading it up, tested, trismol, shut down, loaded up.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_00
 So just sort of based on that.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_00
 But if it doesn't take that long, just I'm going to.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, you can, you know, the option is to do a search in the way that if you do a global search.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_01
 First, the first step only return the meetings as in the not even meetings, but the name of the meetings.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_01
 So, you know, say you want to search for the word language, then it gives you as a result all the meetings that contain the word language.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_01
 And then you can decide, well, I want to search on this and this meeting or only on this meeting or.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_04
 Make it strings for a little bit.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_04
 And then I knew with other things that they actually need to have to set these.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_00
 That makes sense.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_00
 And that way, if they know specifically which meeting it is, I'll save the time because I'm sure they don't want to have the extra loading time either if they can avoid it.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_00
 Or they can check mark against the ones they want to check.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_04
 Did we think about.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_04
 Better names for the meetings.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_00
 I think they were in the text. We can probably do that ourselves and just sort of BDB, you don't just do a.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_00
 There is.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_01
 In one of the papers, they have names.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_04
 Do they do they.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_00
 Like the work group that it's part of.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_01
 One of those.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_05
 That's a working group.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_05
 I want to see the meetings about they've better understand.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_01
 So I've put that in already.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_01
 So yeah, again, concretely to the startup.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_04
 So who would have the ideas.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, the D F.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_04
 Document frequencies.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_04
 Well, do I actually need.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_04
 The frequencies.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, to do what he's keeping talking about you.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_04
 To do the topic label.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I'll write that.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, how is that?

0:23:19	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, do you think you would have time for that as well?

0:23:22	SPEAKER_04
 Well, the thing is if it's being done.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_04
 Somebody's done the key.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_04
 The idea.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_00
 So the D F.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_00
 So really would be.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_00
 There's a class.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_00
 You're trying to get to work on Friday.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_00
 They did have all that.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_00
 It was sort of built in and just had some trouble getting it running properly.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_00
 But it had sort of all that standard sort of stuff.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_00
 So she was going to look at more straightforward sort of thing that really just fulfills what we needed to do.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_00
 But if we do need the frequencies.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_04
 How do you do an inverse of our search without the T F idea?

0:23:53	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_04
 I think you need to.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_04
 What would have been like a list of the amount that they occur over the documents, basically.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_04
 The amount they.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_04
 What does it stand for?

0:24:04	SPEAKER_04
 The F is the document frequencies.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_04
 The amount that each word occurs.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_04
 No, what is it?

0:24:10	SPEAKER_04
 Term frequency is the amount that it occurs.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_04
 One of them is the amount that occurs in each document.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_04
 And the other one is the amount that occurs generally.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_04
 So the more it occurs in specific documents compared to its general score, the better more informative it is about the certain.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_01
 So the general score would that be for the whole of the language or the whole of the whole of the course?

0:24:33	SPEAKER_01
 The whole of course.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_01
 The data.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you know, you know your general frequencies?

0:24:37	SPEAKER_04
 The general one.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_04
 Plus the stop list, so you move stuff that doesn't know what that's showing from a

0:24:55	SPEAKER_00
 C word.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_04
 What? I did do it.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_04
 So do you have a Java class that does it for something?

0:25:08	SPEAKER_01
 Because that would be really handy then we can actually test it on the user as opposed to just doing it and not using it.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_01
 Because if you just have the segmentation that's great but we can't compare it to the hand annotated you know the hand to segment it.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_04
 Also a keyword is giving you a whole new type of search.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_04
 The keyword search could be topic search.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_04
 It could be the same thing instead of it would just search for keywords.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_04
 When you tell them about the projection the topic is for actually a keyword.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_04
 Which is what I mean.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_01
 Do you get that on work?

0:25:48	SPEAKER_01
 That would be really nice.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_04
 I suppose even calculating the what's its face is themselves.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_04
 The easy bit is probably easiest to calculate them based upon in their whole currency in the corpus.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_04
 It is to calculate them per topic because you don't have to integrate as much.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah definitely.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_04
 You can do search without TFI if you just can't rank the search.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah that's what I'm thinking too.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_00
 Do we need to?

0:26:27	SPEAKER_04
 No no no but that's what the idea was in the first place to rank the results.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_01
 Sort of but then the main idea was more like to speed the search up because NXT was over the whole of the corpus.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah but that went slow down.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_04
 Ranking it was slow down.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_01
 No but the general inverted file.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_01
 Oh yeah it still uses an identify but it ranks the results by the amount of the file.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_01
 That would just be nice extra.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah I thought that was part of it but yeah okay it doesn't work.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah I wasn't sure.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think we had that in the document.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_00
 True.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_00
 No we didn't.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_00
 So what is only interim?

0:27:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah exactly.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_04
 But yeah I guess if that's not part of it don't worry about it.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah I mean if you have time.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah because I'm only going to do this a bit more time.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_01
 Because I mean then it would give you like if you search for a word it would give you the meetings but also how often that word occurred and that meeting would be so useful.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_01
 It would just give you a rank.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah exactly.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know actually because I mean this is your top one.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_04
 This is your bottom.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah yeah.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_00
 But the thing is we're just looking for when it happens in a meeting if they're looking for particular term or something.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_00
 They just want to know if that term exists there and where does it exist and I want to see it.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah but it will be useful.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_04
 Now how informative that TFIDF is an informacy school.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_01
 You know if you have if you search for language and you return like you know basically all of the meetings you want to see where they actually spoke about it and where they just mentioned it once.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_00
 If it's like a two word term does a TFIDF.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_00
 It's not a compound down it's just two words together.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_00
 Well I don't know.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_00
 Just something like a Edinburgh University.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_05
 It's like Edinburgh and nine days.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_05
 It's like an adjective.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_04
 And it's my sinful form.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_04
 It would be separate rank for each one each term.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_04
 You could make it more complicated and make it.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_04
 Let's not make it more complicated.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_01
 And then add those up also.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_00
 Because the thing is the way we were doing we were just looking for the words period each word in the index.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_00
 Well that's the way we were thinking about it.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_00
 And then then it's just saying were these two words in any of these documents and then if it was then we'd go closer and do the next research.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_00
 Look for the exact term or the regular expression.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_04
 I guess you just do some of the.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_04
 The individual TFIDF for each term returned and that general will be a bit crude but it will give you a score and the higher the more informative each term is for each thing.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_04
 It's pretty crude anyway.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_04
 It's just looking for.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_04
 It's all it's going to do is look for sex separate.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_04
 Oh then it's going to go into the NXT search and return.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_04
 So are we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do that.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_00
 I just wonder if it's going to give us something cool.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_00
 If it's sort of like if the NXT search is still got to be run to find these terms or these.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah without doing any like.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_00
 Or also like to wildcards work for something like that. So if you're looking for wireless wired wire blah blah blah you do wire with a star.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_00
 Actually that's a problem for me too.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_00
 So.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_05
 That's so.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_04
 The idea is that gives you an informative score how you combine that is.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_04
 I guess there's lots in the literature.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_04
 If you're a smart guy.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_04
 If you're weird.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_04
 There's a whole load about it in Manning and Schutz.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_04
 It's got a whole chunk about.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_04
 So just IR is basically information.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_00
 I have.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_00
 They've got a good chat to it.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_05
 If you haven't got it it's on cognitive.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_05
 I've got somewhere.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_00
 PDF.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to go sort of back to PDF.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_00
 So to come back to the start.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_01
 I'm very unsure about what that actually looked like.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_01
 I mean.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_01
 We want it for the part where you can choose choose the meeting.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_01
 What kind of information do you want to have about meeting?

0:30:56	SPEAKER_01
 I mean the longer name obviously.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_01
 If there is one.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_01
 They don't all have long.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_01
 What the users that spoke.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_01
 Uses that took part.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_01
 Then that's probably pretty much the same for the same group.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_00
 Probably for the most part.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_00
 I mean there'll be a set of people that do it.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_00
 That would stop.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_01
 Just to give them an idea general idea what there is.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_01
 So they can pick a.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_00
 Search for stuff.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_00
 I guess that's huge.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_00
 Like search browse.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_00
 Like if you're looking for something specific like is that what you're thinking?

0:31:35	SPEAKER_00
 Like if they if they know exactly where they want to go they want to go to.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_00
 You know that meeting on December 3rd and they just want to go there and see stuff.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_00
 Then they can really go browse.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_01
 I want to look at the meeting where so and so spoke.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_01
 Of that.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_01
 You know, sort of some sort of research group.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_01
 I want that first meeting.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_02
 Look at that.

0:31:55	None
 Yeah.

0:31:56	None
 Yeah.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_00
 Browse by meeting browse by.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_00
 Like non just think of different ways we can do that.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_00
 Like different buttons on the top.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_00
 Like if they're looking for particular person particular working group particular.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_00
 Whatever.

0:32:10	SPEAKER_00
 And we just.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_00
 We could break things down like that to that level of detail.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_00
 Or we could.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, because we just want to have a way of.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_01
 Because as soon as they've got loaded their first meeting they can.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_01
 They can browse through that quite nicely.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but I'm just thinking like initially when they load up.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_00
 What are the range of things that they'd want to do?

0:32:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_00
 Like if they're part of next working group, they want to get in there.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_00
 Do we want to say preferences?

0:32:44	None
 What do you mean?

0:32:46	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if they're part of BDB working group, they're going to want to look at the BDB ones.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_00
 And so we default to them.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_01
 Or how are we going to know that?

0:32:55	SPEAKER_00
 Based on what they did last time.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_04
 You can have a safe preferences.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_04
 You can have a safe preferences.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_01
 But that would defy the whole point of browsing, right?

0:33:06	SPEAKER_01
 If you only want us to look at all the favorites.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_05
 You can have a favorite.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you just scroll down the list and find your favorite one.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's not like they come back every day and do the same browsing.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_02
 That's what's changed.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_00
 I forgot.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_00
 Well, no, I'm just getting back to the sort of what could be on the startup screen.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_00
 Like there's just a range of things we could do.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_00
 We could have like search options, browse options.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know, just playing around with ideas.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_00
 And then we can tie this into our evaluation tasks.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if you want to search for a meeting or search for a user in a particular meeting, then do this.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_00
 So we can, yeah.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_00
 Guide them.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_00
 It's like, hey, my task is to do this.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_00
 And there's a button for them.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_00
 Perfect.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we quite get it as yeah.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_01
 I wasn't going to put any, you know, any, any help in there, any sort of explanation of how the browser works, to be honest.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_00
 No, that's not what I'm saying.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just saying like these are just like a lot of programs, well, kind of lame programs do have that sort of thing first, just because I want people to have to go through all the menus and search themselves and just like do commonly use tasks or just exit and just let me use the program.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_00
 As well.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_01
 But I mean, the main thing what you want to do is to view a meeting.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_01
 Probably.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_00
 Or search or something.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, or search.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_04
 Even if it's just two things, just said once the one said take me straight to this meeting and have a text box, you can enter it or drop down.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_04
 And then another one that said search that allowed you to instantly plug you out the search, like we find specific meeting.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_00
 No, that's an English one thing.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_04
 Or one that, yeah.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_01
 That all happens to the search.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_01
 Basically either the user knows which meeting you want to look at and you just click on it or he doesn't.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_01
 And then he searches for one that sort of.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_01
 Not much of a question.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_04
 The other thing to do is just have searches the default just it opens and the search window opens and that's the interface.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_04
 And you just go from there.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_04
 And then that brings up the browser after the search for something.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_04
 Or the search, but the search window could have on it something that said just has a drop down menu that says just an go button that said take me to this.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, I see what you mean.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_01
 So the inside the search menu.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_04
 So the only thing that comes up when you finish is a when you start, it's just one window like that.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_04
 And it's got all the search stuff right down there.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_04
 So this is your search.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_04
 Mm hmm.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_04
 Just all here.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_04
 And here is just go to wherever.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_04
 And a go button.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_04
 And then from there it takes you to where the.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's that's what.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_04
 The topic says welcome to welcome to our browser.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that was about right.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_01
 But I'm I'm unsure of that how to put all the information in there.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_01
 Top down menu, but we want all the information about the name the longer.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, you want to have users.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_00
 I don't actually have usernames do you aren't all these codes.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe if they know the codes and other in other.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's too.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_00
 In case like that, we do want drop down.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_00
 We don't want them to type.

0:36:27	None
 Yeah.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_01
 Drop down.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_01
 Not.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_00
 And allow multiple.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_00
 No, okay, you're just looking for one specific.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_00
 You want to search your search.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_04
 If you want to look for one meeting and just look at it.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_04
 Then yeah, as I said, that's two.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, you have to one.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_04
 One there.

0:36:49	SPEAKER_04
 You got to one meeting one speaker and you can choose.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_04
 You can go for go over the other.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_04
 Don't go for both.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, no, I'm not.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not saying you can you can pick a user, but it should come up with some list, but an extended list of the other meetings.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_01
 So, you know, you have BDR, whatever it was called.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, one.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_01
 And then it gives you the longer name.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_01
 And then it gives you the, you know, the participants.

0:37:12	SPEAKER_04
 We could do Microsoft's diary and hold it over it and it pops up a thing.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, I was thinking that.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_01
 But then.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_01
 Is that complicated?

0:37:22	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's not at all.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_01
 I'm talking.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_00
 I'm talking.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not trying that yet.

0:37:27	SPEAKER_01
 How's it going?

0:37:28	SPEAKER_01
 It's over, isn't it?

0:37:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_01
 Let's do that then.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'm not sure.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_01
 Is that very?

0:37:34	SPEAKER_01
 Is that not annoying?

0:37:36	SPEAKER_01
 If you have to get out of the bloody way.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:37:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_01
 I do that a lot, don't they?

0:37:43	SPEAKER_01
 No, to search for a specific user.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_01
 You have to hold your mindset.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_01
 That one, wait for it to pop up.

0:37:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's annoying.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_04
 That's why you could just have a list of your users then.

0:37:55	SPEAKER_04
 And just you just say, I want to look for this user.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_04
 Go.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_04
 Come in.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_04
 Find me.

0:38:01	SPEAKER_04
 Then it pulls up a list of all the ones who've got that user.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_04
 And then you search.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_04
 Then you do in search.

0:38:05	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe just leave it.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_04
 Just have them leading names there.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_04
 And don't worry about the speakers.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_04
 If they're doing speakers, they're doing search.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_04
 It's not the same as doing a quick accent.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:16	None
 Yeah.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_01
 It'd just be nice to have some basic information on you.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_01
 Or you could have a text box there.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'm thinking that that updates.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:24	SPEAKER_01
 As you go over them.

0:38:25	SPEAKER_01
 Depending on what you're doing.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe that's the best idea then.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_01
 So you've got a drop-down menu.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_01
 A search button.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_01
 A search button.

0:38:33	SPEAKER_01
 Not search, go button.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_01
 And then...

0:38:37	SPEAKER_01
 Some sort of fields which updates.

0:38:41	SPEAKER_01
 Depending on what you've got highlighted.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_04
 The full name and then speakers.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:47	SPEAKER_04
 That's my speed.

0:38:48	None
 Mm-hmm.

0:38:49	SPEAKER_04
 We can do all of that without even ever going anywhere near loading up there.

0:38:52	None
 I think.

0:38:53	SPEAKER_04
 I think.

0:38:54	SPEAKER_04
 I think.

0:38:55	SPEAKER_01
 I think.

0:38:56	SPEAKER_04
 I think.

0:38:57	SPEAKER_04
 I think.

0:38:58	SPEAKER_01
 Nom.

0:38:59	SPEAKER_01
 I'm meeting a nom.

0:39:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:39:01	SPEAKER_01
 What is nom actually stand for?

0:39:04	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's a like object model.

0:39:06	SPEAKER_01
 Oh yeah.

0:39:07	SPEAKER_00
 I think in our case it's the great corpus.

0:39:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it is the right corpus.

0:39:12	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_05
 It's the right corpus.

0:39:14	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:39:15	SPEAKER_05
 It's the right corpus and then you've got the right elements.

0:39:17	SPEAKER_05
 You've got the right elements.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_01
 You've got lots of nom something and then knight something and then end something.

0:39:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and actually end ones or interfaces and then knight ones.

0:39:25	SPEAKER_04
 One of the ways around ones are in space and one's actually an implemented class.

0:39:29	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, great.

0:39:30	SPEAKER_04
 Because if you go back enough.

0:39:32	SPEAKER_04
 I think, what's his name not wicked?

0:39:34	SPEAKER_04
 The API is all right but there's not a lot of description in it.

0:39:38	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:39:39	SPEAKER_01
 As you were.

0:39:40	SPEAKER_01
 And most of the descriptions are hints to each other saying you've got to update this Jonathan.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_01
 This is an unintelligible.

0:39:47	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:39:48	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:39:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:39:50	SPEAKER_05
 So you end up just setting returns that and text box.

0:39:54	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:39:55	SPEAKER_05
 What's that though?

0:39:56	SPEAKER_05
 It's an implementation of an end text.

0:39:58	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:39:59	SPEAKER_05
 What's that?

0:40:00	SPEAKER_05
 Extended version of it.

0:40:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:40:06	SPEAKER_01
 That's a great thing.

0:40:08	SPEAKER_01
 Not very fun.

0:40:11	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:40:12	SPEAKER_01
 So anyone else got anything to say?

0:40:16	SPEAKER_00
 Not really.

0:40:17	SPEAKER_00
 Just going to keep on going.

0:40:20	SPEAKER_01
 Do we, yeah.

0:40:21	SPEAKER_01
 Do we want another meeting at the end of the week with Peniel?

0:40:26	SPEAKER_00
 Might be useful.

0:40:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:40:28	SPEAKER_00
 Like Friday afternoon or something?

0:40:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:40:31	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I think I'm going to do quite a bit of work this week so I'll probably want to talk about.

0:40:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:40:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think.

0:40:38	SPEAKER_00
 And we won't have to have the meeting with Steve on Tuesday or at all.

0:40:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:40:42	SPEAKER_00
 So do we want to arrange this, get this one earlier?

0:40:45	SPEAKER_00
 Three years.

0:40:46	SPEAKER_00
 If you like.

0:40:48	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we can just discuss that Friday if we have one.

0:40:51	None
 That's true.

0:40:53	None
 Okay.

0:40:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:40:55	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:40:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:40:58	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:40:59	None
 I don't know.

0:41:00	SPEAKER_04
 What time?

0:41:01	SPEAKER_04
 Just after SPT.

0:41:03	SPEAKER_00
 Possibly.

0:41:04	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:41:06	SPEAKER_00
 Usually by then.

0:41:07	SPEAKER_00
 So need a break.

0:41:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:41:09	SPEAKER_00
 But that means.

0:41:10	SPEAKER_00
 Although right.

0:41:11	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I don't know because it's the lab and try and get some work done.

0:41:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:41:14	SPEAKER_00
 For the lab stuff.

0:41:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:41:16	SPEAKER_01
 I've got a doctor's appointment at 10 to two.

0:41:19	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:41:20	SPEAKER_04
 And.

0:41:21	SPEAKER_04
 What?

0:41:22	SPEAKER_00
 What?

0:41:27	SPEAKER_00
 Three o'clock.

0:41:28	SPEAKER_00
 Or you want to get.

0:41:30	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe I do.

0:41:32	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not sure.

0:41:33	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:41:34	SPEAKER_00
 She's got a class at 11.

0:41:37	SPEAKER_00
 We've all got class.

0:41:40	SPEAKER_00
 What's up class of 12.

0:41:42	SPEAKER_04
 How about.

0:41:44	SPEAKER_04
 We say three o'clock and then if there's a series.

0:41:47	SPEAKER_00
 We could try one.

0:41:48	SPEAKER_00
 We could try shortly after.

0:41:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:41:52	SPEAKER_00
 Would you want to know?

0:41:55	SPEAKER_00
 If one's bad for you.

0:41:57	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, that would only give us like.

0:42:00	SPEAKER_01
 Well, what.

0:42:03	SPEAKER_01
 How about like like, you know, five or six.

0:42:07	SPEAKER_00
 Three is bad.

0:42:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:42:09	SPEAKER_01
 Well, three o'clock.

0:42:11	SPEAKER_04
 Let's say three o'clock.

0:42:12	SPEAKER_04
 And then.

0:42:14	SPEAKER_04
 If there's a problem with that, then it's three o'clock.

0:42:17	SPEAKER_04
 And then five or six will be a problem.

0:42:20	SPEAKER_04
 Because I won't be here.

0:42:21	SPEAKER_04
 But I don't think that will be not sure.

0:42:24	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:42:25	SPEAKER_01
 I write this meeting up and I'll send it to.

0:42:28	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:42:29	SPEAKER_04
 Is she collecting them?

0:42:31	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:42:32	SPEAKER_05
 Because she's not here.

0:42:34	SPEAKER_05
 She collecting.

0:42:36	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, right.

0:42:37	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, yeah.

0:42:38	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry.

0:42:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:42:40	SPEAKER_03
 I collect meeting somebody.

0:42:42	SPEAKER_05
 I thought somebody was collecting them.

0:42:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:42:47	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's what I thought we'd do.

0:42:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:42:49	SPEAKER_04
 We should probably do that at the end.

0:42:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:42:51	SPEAKER_01
 Then we'd know who's missed them.

0:42:52	SPEAKER_01
 So can we just repeat briefly what we've spoken about?

0:42:55	SPEAKER_01
 So we didn't done a progress on the speaker characterization.

0:42:59	SPEAKER_01
 Who does the speaker characterization?

0:43:01	SPEAKER_01
 We mentioned topic labeling with keywords.

0:43:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:43:07	SPEAKER_01
 We discussed if the search should be ranked.

0:43:11	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yes.

0:43:14	SPEAKER_00
 Michael, did you have anything else?

0:43:17	SPEAKER_00
 There's just sort of the basic implementation stuff that I was running about.

0:43:20	SPEAKER_00
 But, you know, it should be fine.

0:43:22	SPEAKER_00
 It's just progressing.

0:43:24	SPEAKER_00
 We decide whether to be ranked.

0:43:26	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:43:27	SPEAKER_01
 Well, basically not.

0:43:31	SPEAKER_01
 Not unless you've got time for at the end.

0:43:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:43:34	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I kind of think you would complicate things quite a bit and not bring us a lot.

0:43:40	SPEAKER_00
 Just because if it is like independently doing the words for a particular document, it's not really getting them together.

0:43:47	SPEAKER_00
 Like if someone's looking for a particular term.

0:43:49	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:43:51	SPEAKER_00
 Just don't know if it would bring us that much.

0:43:54	SPEAKER_01
 I think it would.

0:43:55	SPEAKER_00
 How so?

0:43:56	SPEAKER_01
 I think it would give you the most relevant result.

0:44:01	SPEAKER_00
 If they're looking for, like I say, sunny day and, you know, sunny shows up in this document, day shows up, but they're not together.

0:44:08	SPEAKER_00
 Or if they are together.

0:44:11	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:44:12	SPEAKER_00
 It just doesn't, you're looking for that term and relevance is kind of irrelevant because if the term shows up, it shows up.

0:44:17	SPEAKER_01
 No, but for things like if you search for language, then you might have, you have some topics which have as a, you know, some meetings which have as a topic language.

0:44:27	SPEAKER_01
 They specifically speak about language and they use that word like in every sentence.

0:44:31	SPEAKER_01
 And then you've got those that just mention, you know, mention it briefly like once or twice saying, you know, my language is German or something stupid, but you don't really want.

0:44:39	SPEAKER_01
 So you want to distinguish that somehow.

0:44:41	SPEAKER_01
 Or not.

0:44:42	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway.

0:44:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that would be a, for single, for single words, it would be very useful.

0:44:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:44:47	SPEAKER_03
 For multiple terms, unless you want to do something that will be a way of doing it for multiple terms.

0:44:52	SPEAKER_03
 For multiple terms, we can just do something really simple.

0:44:55	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, yeah.

0:44:56	SPEAKER_04
 Or you could do it and override it by the, you could just ignore the ranking if it doesn't show up together.

0:45:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:45:05	SPEAKER_04
 Or you could penalize it.

0:45:07	SPEAKER_00
 You could just put a way to do the search is still to do the NXT search.

0:45:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:45:11	SPEAKER_00
 Do the NXT search.

0:45:12	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't sound together either disregarded or waiting against it.

0:45:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:45:17	SPEAKER_00
 If you, how many pairs you get.

0:45:18	SPEAKER_00
 I wouldn't show up on the search results if you're expecting things.

0:45:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:45:21	SPEAKER_00
 So then just, just disregard it.

0:45:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:45:24	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, you just do it really simply, you know, you'll have the results.

0:45:27	SPEAKER_00
 We'll have to talk to her now about this.

0:45:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:45:30	SPEAKER_00
 See how she's doing this.

0:45:31	SPEAKER_00
 We are using that.

0:45:32	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it does make sense for that.

0:45:34	SPEAKER_00
 But, yeah, actually, yeah.

0:45:39	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't have to be your intelligent.

0:45:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:45:42	SPEAKER_01
 Because some things you're going to get a lot of results.

0:45:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:45:45	SPEAKER_04
 And if the one that you got just happened to be at the bottom and it was actually the most relevant one, something that was also.

0:45:49	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, if it's, well, yeah.

0:45:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:45:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:45:53	SPEAKER_00
 It's here to me.

0:45:54	SPEAKER_00
 I think we could actually put that like on the list of meetings that get returned if there were 15 meetings or languages in.

0:46:00	SPEAKER_00
 It's going to show you.

0:46:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:46:03	SPEAKER_00
 It's just the language.

0:46:04	SPEAKER_00
 It's just the language.

0:46:05	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:46:06	SPEAKER_04
 And also with something like Sunny Day, the.

0:46:12	SPEAKER_04
 If Sunny and they aren't mentioned together a lot, but it's only to have a bunch of ones that it's term will be low and will push down the other one if you combine them.

0:46:19	SPEAKER_00
 The things, I mean, that'll be exactly how we're doing it now.

0:46:22	SPEAKER_00
 Like we're just looking for the two words separately.

0:46:24	SPEAKER_00
 See if they exist in the same document.

0:46:25	SPEAKER_00
 If they do, then there's possibility that they occur together and then we do the next decision on that document.

0:46:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:46:31	SPEAKER_04
 But you have no ranking system on the moment.

0:46:32	SPEAKER_04
 So if something's an amazing highly ranked thing from the team, I think it could just be ignored because it falls off the bottom of the.

0:46:39	SPEAKER_04
 I'll assume you only have to return all results for all.

0:46:44	SPEAKER_04
 Say you type language and it returns 75 meetings or rate down.

0:46:48	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know what it's doing.

0:46:51	SPEAKER_00
 But yeah.

0:46:52	SPEAKER_04
 But there are 75 meeting.

0:46:54	SPEAKER_01
 Is there really?

0:46:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:46:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:46:57	SPEAKER_01
 Wow.

0:46:58	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:46:59	SPEAKER_04
 So if it so yeah, if you return 75, where do you stop?

0:47:03	SPEAKER_04
 How do you rank them or something or returns 20 even returns 20?

0:47:06	SPEAKER_04
 Do you cut it off at 10?

0:47:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:47:08	SPEAKER_04
 The rank them do.

0:47:09	SPEAKER_04
 That's true.

0:47:10	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:47:11	SPEAKER_04
 What's the pressure on the right?

0:47:12	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:47:13	SPEAKER_05
 Look through the wall.

0:47:14	SPEAKER_05
 See the wall.

0:47:15	SPEAKER_01
 By the time it would be useful as well for a word like language that might occur in all of them.

0:47:20	SPEAKER_01
 But you want to find the one that actually contains it usefully somehow.

0:47:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:47:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:47:27	SPEAKER_01
 You know, you still want to be able to search for the word language in a sensible way.

0:47:35	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we'll discuss it again on Friday.

0:47:41	SPEAKER_04
 So is that it?

0:47:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:47:57	SPEAKER_04
 Done.

0:47:58	SPEAKER_04
 Tick.

0:47:59	SPEAKER_04
 Tick.

0:48:00	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:48:01	SPEAKER_04
 That's fine.

0:48:02	None
 I've already.

0:48:03	None
 Yeah.

0:48:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:48:24	None
 Okay.

0:48:44	None
 Okay.

0:49:04	None
 Okay.

0:49:24	None
 Okay.
