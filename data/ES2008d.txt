0:00:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_04
 Welcome to our detailed design meeting.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_04
 I'm pretty excited.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_04
 Let's start.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_04
 It's approximately 1540 or something like that.

0:00:49	None
 Okay.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_04
 The agenda, we're going to do an opening and then I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting what we did just fast.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_04
 Then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_04
 We'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and clothes.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_04
 So starting off with the last one, I don't have it here, but we talked about energy.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to use a kinetic battery.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_04
 We want to use a simple chip because we're not going to need a shovel.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to need a scroll, we're choosing a latex case in fruity colors that's curved.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_04
 And we're using push buttons with a supplement of an on-screen menu.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_04
 Then sounded like we had set eight or nine buttons, including five preset channels.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_04
 Let's do the look and field design presentation first.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_02
 Right, well we made three different prototypes and I guess we'll start with this one.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_02
 We have our colors not fixed, but this is the general shape.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_02
 You hold it either like this in your left hand or you switch it over and it's easily adaptable to either hand.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_02
 You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone or you can push them with your index finger with your other hand.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_02
 Or even then there's a whole variety.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_02
 You can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_02
 We have the on-off button at the tip, very visible, very big.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_02
 We have our up and down buttons which are also going to be our channel selectors and we have our little menu button here.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_02
 If you push, if you're just pushing these normally, they're the menu buttons.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_02
 If the volume buttons are either if you press select once, they become channel changing buttons, you can press select three times, the menu with the other features and possibly also with your TV channel choices shows up and you have your five presets down here.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_02
 If people want to grab hold of that, see how it feels in your hand.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_02
 Let's our number one prototype.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_02
 Do you want to present the potato or shall I peel off the varsity?

0:03:09	SPEAKER_04
 The exact little lightning bolt in it, very cute.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_00
 This one's nice.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_00
 It's not presented.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_00
 It's an ergonomic shape.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_00
 It fits in your hand.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_00
 It's designed to be used to be in your left hand or in your right hand.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_00
 I've come here just for four buttons on this one.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_00
 The two blue buttons here are just in the volume.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_00
 You can follow them down on the other side here.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_00
 The other one is outdoor channel.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_00
 Channel now.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_00
 This moves between your favorite channels.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_00
 This middle button here is our pion screen menu.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_00
 When you work in your pion screen menu, you use the other four buttons.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_00
 Another guy to know the menu is the state of the middle button.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_04
 That's basically it.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_04
 On off.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_00
 That would be one of your channels.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_00
 It turns off.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_01
 Could the middle button of the on screen menu function as a power button?

0:04:29	SPEAKER_00
 No, it would make it hard to do it.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_02
 If you press and held it, maybe.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_01
 You can call it down.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_02
 It would be on off.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_02
 It's the possibility.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_02
 Finally, we have the Martian or the pair.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_02
 Either way, it's a bit different.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_02
 Just a little bit more of a creative feel.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_02
 You have the on off toggle stem on the top.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_02
 We have the five preset seats.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_02
 Then you have all the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_02
 You have your channel changing volume changing buttons on your menu button right here in the middle.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_02
 That's for your consideration as well.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_02
 Plus, it's an interesting talking point to have standing up.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_02
 We figured it could stand up like this on your table if you wanted it to if I made the bottom part.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry, what's the yellow one in the middle?

0:05:28	SPEAKER_02
 The menu select button.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_04
 Very interesting.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_00
 That was my favorite.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think we were thinking that normally we'd go for fruity colors, but we'd go for

0:05:58	SPEAKER_02
 a fruity color. Maybe we're also thinking that you're sort of middle-aged man for an example customer might not want a fruity color or a fruity color.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_02
 That was when we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_02
 We're talking about a fruity color.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe when you press it, a little beep goes off.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_02
 There might be something that you can do in the short of word in the chip to make it make a noise or something, but it would take a lot more development than we have this after.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_04
 That's a fair evaluation.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_04
 We've decided not to worry about that for now.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_04
 Well, the designs are very bright, so you're right.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_02
 Do people have a preference as far as feeling functionality?

0:08:12	SPEAKER_01
 I feel like this is similar to what already exists.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if you're trying to think of something new and fun, but I'm initially drawn to.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_01
 It's comfortable and not different.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_01
 I also like the side buttons on that one.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_04
 I think that's kind of neat.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_02
 Could we have an extra button on the top for Anos?

0:09:00	SPEAKER_04
 Why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria?

0:09:06	SPEAKER_01
 I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_01
 I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do, but I have to write something on the whiteboard.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_04
 Do you need this or just write on the whiteboard?

0:09:21	SPEAKER_01
 No, I actually don't have a PowerPointy thing.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_01
 I think it would be redundant.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_04
 It's kind of like a joystick kind of thing.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_04
 Hey.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe a little smaller than that.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_04
 No, I kind of like it. That's hard to miss.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, it does.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_04
 It's kind of like...

0:09:48	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_04
 There. It could have a stem like that because I do kind of like the stem.

0:10:00	None
 Yeah.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_04
 It almost helps you keep a grip too because it goes in between things.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_04
 Just a... I like this one.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. That would be a little thing for the potatoes.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_02
 I like the idea of a...

0:10:14	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down that one.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_04
 I am worried about like using a menu.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_04
 It's not like within menus there are sub menus.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_04
 And so how do you get back to the main menu?

0:10:32	SPEAKER_04
 Well, on the ION menu, every time you want to go back, you hit the menu button.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_04
 And you back there.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_04
 That is a menu button separate from a select button.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_04
 Whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_00
 It's the...

0:10:45	SPEAKER_00
 You have to down button so you can scroll down for this.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_00
 You find the choice that you want.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_00
 So you just...

0:10:55	SPEAKER_03
 You just provide money.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_02
 Could these be used for going sub menu?

0:11:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so maybe it could be one of those if you press down and hold for two seconds.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_02
 Then it brings you back one level or something.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_04
 Well, as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address?

0:11:19	SPEAKER_01
 Whether or not it meets our necessities.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_01
 The yellow we want is that potato?

0:11:25	SPEAKER_01
 Are we leaning towards the potato?

0:11:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, well we can obviously change it after we go through these different ones.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_01
 So basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_01
 We need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_01
 So what we sort of want to do is we each need to separately rank each of the following things.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_01
 And then I'll tabulate in average just to make sure that it doesn't meet that.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_01
 And seven being not true at all or false.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_01
 If the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_01
 So we can do this one first.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_01
 First you want to know if it meets the fancy look and feel objective.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_01
 So like in my opinion, for now at least the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm going to say it's like the three.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_01
 That's just my opinion.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_01
 What is each of you?

0:12:30	SPEAKER_04
 I kind of think it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or two.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_01
 Well, give it the number.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_04
 I will give it a one.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if it's creative.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if fancy is the word I would use.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if any of them are fancy.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_02
 I'd say two because unique.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_01
 And two.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_01
 Awesome.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 All right. And same sort of scale for functionality.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_01
 Functional.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's extremely functional.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to give it a one.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 One.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_04
 Functional.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_04
 I think it'll get everything done.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_04
 I think it might be a little confusing first.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_03
 Well, there's some other.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. Then I'm going to give it a two.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_01
 We want to know next if it's technologically innovative.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_01
 Did you give it a functional?

0:13:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_01
 She said it.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_01
 Is it technologically innovative?

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 Not really.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, not so much because we don't have the LCD screen.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_01
 We don't have fancy chip.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_01
 Other than what it looks like, I don't know if it's...

0:13:50	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the kinetic battery.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_01
 The kinetic battery is a big one.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_02
 How many people have noticed that though?

0:13:57	SPEAKER_04
 But we know it's there.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_04
 And you'll be like, hey, I have never changed the battery.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_01
 And if it's made of latex, that whole idea, that's pretty cool.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_01
 I'll give it a three.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_01
 Because it could have picked a lot of features.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_02
 I would say that it's...

0:14:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_02
 Like fancy versus creative.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_02
 It's different.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_02
 Which is that even innovative?

0:14:21	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_00
 It's a thermonodicase.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_00
 It's not unique.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_00
 It's just...

0:14:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's just for fucking...

0:14:34	SPEAKER_00
 So I'll give it a three.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_04
 I think I'm going to go with four as well.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_04
 I really like the kinetic battery.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_01
 Next, is it easy to use?

0:14:44	SPEAKER_01
 Just so you know, easy to learn will be separate.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_01
 Is it all?

0:14:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_01
 Overlapped them.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's really easy to use.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_01
 Two.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_02
 I'll give it a one.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_02
 Pretty hard to mess up.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_01
 I'll say two.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_01
 We next want to see if it has a spongy quality.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_01
 And if indeed it's made of latex or rubber.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_01
 It's spongy all the way.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_04
 Give it one.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_00
 One of the bounces when you drop it.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_02
 Ooh.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_02
 Then you could...

0:15:19	SPEAKER_02
 It'd be how you could break, so we...

0:15:21	SPEAKER_04
 It'd be less impact.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_00
 And what do you give it?

0:15:25	None
 Okay.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_01
 And the next is...

0:15:28	SPEAKER_01
 Does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables?

0:15:31	SPEAKER_01
 Well, is it going to be yellow?

0:15:37	SPEAKER_02
 It might be, who that's our corporate color is this?

0:15:40	SPEAKER_04
 That's right.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, corporate color.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_04
 We didn't keep that in.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_02
 We might not keep it yellow.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_04
 Well, if we...

0:15:46	SPEAKER_04
 I know it would make it a little less...

0:15:48	SPEAKER_04
 It's more confusing, but if we had all the buttons in black and the design and the outside and yellow, that would be our corporate one.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_04
 And then we could also have alternative colors.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_04
 One and more conservative one.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_01
 One that's more fruity.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's more like a silvery kind of white or something.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_04
 And can we have like an RR inscribed on the bottom or something?

0:16:06	SPEAKER_04
 Sure.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_01
 So I think it...

0:16:09	SPEAKER_02
 It was inspired by the potato.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's kind of mango-y too.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_04
 Ooh.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_01
 I think it was a little one.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_02
 The mango kind of put me over.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_01
 That's so much more sure.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_01
 What's everyone's number?

0:16:23	SPEAKER_01
 One.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, it's a...

0:16:26	SPEAKER_01
 One.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_01
 And does the design match the appropriate behavior?

0:16:31	SPEAKER_01
 Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons that they use the channel for being in the volume the most.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_01
 I think we really took that into account a lot.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm going to give it a one.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_02
 Me too.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_01
 Do you say one, Rose?

0:16:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_01
 I'm also...

0:16:50	SPEAKER_01
 We talked earlier about RSI and wanting to prevent any sort of like carpal tunneling kind of thing.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_01
 Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account?

0:17:03	SPEAKER_01
 I think I'll give it a two because I almost feel like no matter what you do, something is going to happen.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_04
 And if it's repetitive movement, it is going to be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_04
 But I'm worth the rest.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_04
 I like how it fits in the hand though.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_04
 I'd go with the two.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_02
 I'll say two as well because older people that aren't used to like texting, but if I might mind a bit, you cry at first.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_02
 But...

0:17:31	SPEAKER_00
 You're all in positive two.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_01
 All right, awesome.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_01
 And the ease of learning it.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_01
 I know you were saying that you were a little bit nervous about that.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_01
 It's sort of a reminding of the iPod.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_01
 I just got my NICELET RED, the instruction book, and I'm doing okay.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:17:46	SPEAKER_01
 And I'm not good at learning technology.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_01
 So I'll give it a two.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_02
 The menu system and the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_02
 But I think if it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out, but you'll have it afterwards.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_02
 So I think I'd give it a two, I guess.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's probably a little harder than most of them, because you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what you've done over.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, good point.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_00
 I think that everyone can pass through.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_00
 Once you've learned how to use it, I think that you want to give it a four.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_04
 I think it'd give it a four, too.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_04
 Pretty high learning curve, it'll be easy once you've done it, but...

0:18:33	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_01
 Also, earlier we had something about losing it, and so now we're not addressing that at all.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_04
 So...

0:18:41	SPEAKER_04
 I think we can kind of say we addressed it with color.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_01
 So in terms of not losing it, do you think that on a scale of one to seven, how easy or hard is it to lose?

0:18:52	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to give it a four, because I think that you can still...

0:18:57	SPEAKER_01
 In between somewhere where you can't see it, you're kind of not going to find it, but anywhere else it's going to stand out.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_02
 I said give it a three.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_02
 This depends how tidy you are normally who you're giving it a four.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_03
 Small, too.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_01
 We also said simplicity.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_01
 How well does it address just being simple?

0:19:24	SPEAKER_02
 It's useful to use or simple on design.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
 I think overall, because we had said before, our two main things were simplicity and fashion, so those are the next few things we're going to look at.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_01
 Separate from fancy, like that sort of thing.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_01
 It wants to be simple, but it's not totally totally simple, so I'm going to give it a two.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_02
 I want to give it a three, I guess.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_01
 Three.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_01
 It's fashionable.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_04
 It's totally fashionable.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_01
 It's hot.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it's a mango.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_01
 Mom.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, how fashionable can you make a road?

0:20:00	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's bringing technology and fashion together really well.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot or both.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 I do like the little animation.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the toggle on off switch.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_01
 It's really appealing.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 Number of two.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's a good one.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_01
 And does it meet our demographic need for international appeal?

0:20:30	SPEAKER_01
 That whole thing.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_01
 I just said it would serve our audience.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_01
 I don't see why not.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_04
 I think as long as we offer in at least three different color arrangements.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's good.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_04
 So I'll give it a two.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_01
 Does anyone have any other features that they think are important that we didn't talk about?

0:20:56	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to have a corporate logo.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_04
 So let's make sure we keep that in mind that we have that one of our colored concepts is corporate and has an RR on it.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I think all of us have an RR.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_01
 And so we're going to do that.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_01
 So it will address it.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_01
 Fine.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_04
 Now we're going to look at finances.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_04
 I have an Excel sheet that we're actually going to calculate the costs.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_04
 So let me add it out of this first.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_03
 I know.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_04
 Hand dynamo.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_04
 We're using a kinetic battery, right?

0:21:54	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, we're using a kinetic battery, right?

0:21:55	SPEAKER_04
 We're using a kinetic battery, right?

0:21:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_04
 And we're having one per one.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_04
 One.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_04
 Electronics.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_02
 Single.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_02
 Simple.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_02
 Simple, rather.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_03
 A case.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_04
 A double curved.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_02
 It's very curvy.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't get a picture of it.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_01
 So I don't really know.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_02
 Our case material supplements.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_02
 We just get the plastic and.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_02
 No, we, we, the plastic is, the plastic for the inside is assumed.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_01
 The supplement is the wool.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I guess it was rubber rather than rubber and special collar, right?

0:22:36	SPEAKER_04
 one special color? Yeah we're using, we're gonna need at least two special colors. I don't

0:22:44	SPEAKER_01
 know what the basic colors are. Well but we know that we're having at least three colors.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_02
 Well are we talking about on each color combination or we know that like we'll have yellow and black, is that two special colors? I don't know or that white and black bandage or... I guess this is three.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe the RR will be in color as well so yeah. Interface. We're doing push buttons. Yep. And how many buttons do we have?

0:23:20	SPEAKER_04
 Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex. Anything else? No. Oh we'll... do we want...

0:23:30	SPEAKER_02
 Oh button in special colors? I didn't get information on that. Oh wait. Oh buttons. Oh so um so the case material

0:23:39	SPEAKER_04
 will just have one color right? Well the buttons will be in special colors. But if we're making multiple

0:23:44	SPEAKER_02
 varieties of... this is where I'm getting confused. We're saying per unit. Per unit. Okay so each unit

0:23:50	SPEAKER_04
 will only have one color. All right in each unit. But the cases could have up to three... I mean the buttons could be up to three colors? That's how it's designed there. I like it like that. Okay.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_04
 Special form. They're all kind of just push buttons. No I think they're fun. Special material. We want

0:24:09	SPEAKER_02
 them rubber as well probably. Yeah. Oh I have to do it per button. Do I? No I don't think so. I think they're all gonna be rubber than it. That's what it matters. Yeah because for the whole

0:24:25	SPEAKER_01
 case material it's only one. Yeah. I mean it's two to make it rubber. Okay. Oh wait so maybe.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_04
 13.7. Uh oh. Yeah. What can we... Okay let's have our buttons. I'll be one color. I kind of like the about that would do. It's only gonna burn us down to 13.3 anyway. All right.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. Are we sure this is double curved? Maybe it's single. We have to know what

0:24:50	SPEAKER_03
 the idea is. I don't know. I didn't get any pictures. It's single curved. What's not? Yeah. Okay. It's

0:25:06	SPEAKER_04
 a kinetic battery that's kind of expensive but we have a simple chip. Single curve. Case material is rubber and it's a special color. Yeah. But that's important. That is important.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_02
 Six buttons. How did we get all the tests? What did you just change? What was it was 13 and that was 15.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_04
 No okay maybe not. I don't know what just happened. Now it's 12. Oh. 12.5. Hey.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_04
 So we're okay. I think then. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We're all set.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_04
 I saved that to our big shared folder. So you know. Okay. Back to agenda.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_04
 Are the costs under 1250 euro? Yes. Yeah. I are. Let's move on to the project evaluation.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_04
 Project process. So I was faction with for example the room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, the means and you know ideas found. So I guess what we're going to talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project, the information we got and used how we used it if we were able to use our creativity with the information. How well I guess I let it. How well we worked together as a team, the digital pen, the whiteboard. Okay. I felt very creative. I enjoyed making the prototype.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_00
 I think we've been successful in that to almost all the other models for the 777 stuff.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_00
 With some of the things that we've been doing, yes, the best.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_02
 I think we could have done even better with a little bit more information like once a single curve case, how many colors, what the colors count, things. But given what we had I think we did we did really well.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_02
 I think we worked together pretty well.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. I mean if I had had more market research other than the person best of us maybe we could have

0:27:25	SPEAKER_02
 taken that into account. But the fruit is the most stimulated by creativity.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_01
 I know I really did the whole mango ideas. No. I mean, do you think that the pen was a little distracting for me personally. Like it's heaviness. I mean like just being so conscious of turning the pages, I don't know. That was a bit of a distraction. But with the last one, like I chose not to do a power of wink. And I think it made sense to hear so I like that I had the option to do that and just to take my own note and what sort of thing.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_04
 I think we all made very significant contributions. I don't think anybody dominated it, which I thought was really good. Like each of us was able to, like, could you have had your information and I tried to facilitate it without like taking it over.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_04
 Little fish waters.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_01
 I'm really cute. I kind of want one.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_02
 Can we work at this as the back go remote? Should we have that somewhere on the packaging?

0:28:30	SPEAKER_01
 I have a little problem. Trying to think of a good pun that I could add there.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_01
 I know. Let's take a look at it like a large angle.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_01
 I like the RR that's going to be etched in.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yes. Hopefully not with just my thinking out at one point.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to use for a little gadget.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_02
 Oh thanks to Ian for the design of that one.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. What's it like? My ideas. My ideas.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_02
 My ideas. People should really base their votes on towards the vegetable.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_04
 Definitely.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_04
 Or at least be creative enough to think of tug-of-switches.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_02
 I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I'm still excited about them.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_02
 Can anyone know they existed?

0:29:13	SPEAKER_02
 I knew you could get watches that had them, like, really quite expensive watches.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_02
 That just never need a battery because you're always moving your wrist.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_02
 But in other things, I think it would be really good.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, closing.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_04
 At the cost of the budget.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_04
 With the project evaluated.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_04
 That was a final questionnaire meeting summary.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_04
 So this is a great product, kids.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_04
 I think we've created something really interesting and that we have a market for it.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_04
 Especially if we can produce it at 12.3, which we hope.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the the final results.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I do like the Martian route.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_04
 If we could choose more than one, that would be my second choice.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that would definitely be my second choice.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_01
 Although the twat toggle.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_04
 I'm afraid I would break it.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_04
 I would break it.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_02
 I think I would break it.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_02
 It started because I wanted to have it as a stem.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_02
 That's funny.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_02
 It started as a pair, but it started looking word-world like fortune.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_02
 I'm looking like a penguin.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_01
 I'm like, I'm going to go.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_03
 No, I can't.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_01
 I like that it stands on.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_02
 Well, maybe I should market it to some remote control company.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to buy it.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_02
 So our art.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, it's a little sad.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_03
 It's a little sad.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_04
 Congratulations.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_01
 Nothing will come up until after our meeting.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_01
 It's supposed to be over at five.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_01
 I'm...

0:31:13	SPEAKER_04
 I got more master classes than anybody else.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_04
 We think we can take a master's class.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_02
 That's really funny that you got spammed in your work.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_04
 But check it out.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_04
 So like, there are all these links that are going.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_04
 But you need to keep in mind your knowledge management.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_04
 Just want to make sure you do.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_01
 No, the first time I used something like I didn't realize it was a joke.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_01
 And I was like, why didn't she send it to us?

0:31:37	SPEAKER_01
 It's very work relevant because it's- It's a spam a lot.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, definitely.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_04
 I'm very sad that I didn't get any links to the corporate website.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_01
 Here, you can see what's in there.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_02
 You can see the corporate website.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_02
 You can just see what's- It's paration about ticket for his- Wow.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_01
 It's really deep.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_01
 It takes a little while.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_01
 I'm getting excited to load.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_01
 That's like, something is pretty cool.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's a very live excel.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_01
 It's one of my favorite programs.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_01
 It's like, inspiration.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_01
 Basically, I'm going to give you two sentences on fashion and that kind of thing.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_01
 See?

0:32:12	SPEAKER_01
 You miss out that much.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, my inspiration from- From last time is- The interior of our remote control being taken apart bit by bit.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_02
 Talking about circuit ports.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_02
 I learned a lot actually.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_01
 No, why not?

0:32:23	SPEAKER_02
 I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_01
 That's almost cooler.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_01
 I got a whole table and everything.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_02
 I don't have all of those circuits and chips and trans ponders and- I wrote it all down because I thought it would be relevant.

0:32:37	SPEAKER_02
 Like all the different parts of the inside of our remote control.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_02
 But then they're like, you don't actually need this.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_02
 You just like, my name was like,

0:32:43	SPEAKER_01
 would you prefer an LCD screen or a multifunction remote control that I didn't have any kind of table?

0:32:49	SPEAKER_01
 Like, it's awesome.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_01
 I'm glad they asked that question and didn't report there as well.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_02
 It's really interesting though.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_04
 I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_04
 We had a lot of- Otherwise, the technology out today was kind of cool.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_02
 That was really- How is it?

0:33:07	SPEAKER_02
 Emails?

0:33:08	SPEAKER_00
 Would you use the whiteboard to make it?

0:33:10	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_04
 Although I don't see how we could have very a lot, at least for me.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_04
 I- I-

0:33:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. If I had gotten pictures of the different parts of the case, the different looks of the case, I would have probably drawn them up.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_01
 So we weren't like voting on anything.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_01
 I think usually, like, great boards are good.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_01
 And you're like crossing ideas or like, if we had like a brain- They don't put a brain-

0:33:33	SPEAKER_02
 They don't put a brain-

0:33:33	None
 They don't put a brain- They don't put a brain- They don't put a brain- They don't put a brain- They don't put a brain- They don't put a brain- They don't put a brain- They don't put a brain-

0:33:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yes. And these might have- And these might have-

0:33:43	None
 And these might have- And these might have- And these might have- Made us more- Willing to like, take notes-

0:33:46	SPEAKER_01
 woulding to like-

0:33:48	None
 take notes- Or write them up here, Woulding to like, take notes-

0:33:49	None
 take notes- And to like, write them up here- Gleich surges-

0:33:50	None
 to like- Is like,ich surges-

0:33:55	SPEAKER_02
 names- Since we're all gonna thank you for that.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_02
 Look- And instead of- know it's up on the whiteboard.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_02
 Would have been all right, but everyone needs their own specific notes to get.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_04
 Now when you were creating your prototypes here, did you work together or did you do separate projects?

0:34:15	SPEAKER_00
 We worked together, but we were like, like, sort of like different projects and then discussed

0:34:32	SPEAKER_02
 how the body was going to work. We just kind of started out by each taking a color of clay and just pulling around with it and I came out with that rhombus shape and he came out with a sort of potato-y mango shape and then just went from there really.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_02
 Cool, that was fun.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_02
 So well done with the management.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_02
 I felt well managed.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, thank you.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_00
 I think we could go out and see how it was.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_00
 It's possible keeping our machines to find.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_00
 It's like in the actually...

0:35:07	SPEAKER_00
 You did a good job with making fun decisions with them.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_00
 I was really worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting, we didn't

0:35:35	SPEAKER_02
 get to do it. I'm not usually a very decisive person, so it helped to have people say this needs to be

0:35:50	None
 down to five minutes. I found that we could have used another five or ten minutes.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_04
 Especially last time.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_04
 I think the last time we had a lot of information, but at the same time not quite enough.

0:36:06	SPEAKER_04
 We couldn't answer every single question.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_02
 I felt the first two meetings that I was coming in with no information.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_02
 It made me really...

0:36:20	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_02
 Throwing together a power point out of no information.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_02
 Last time it was like the opposite.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_04
 It was interesting what came out later, when I was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me, that more points came out from your presentation.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_04
 I am a little disappointed that we didn't do something for losing the room out.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_02
 That was a big point.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_02
 In order to talk about that, we would have had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_01
 Even when we were creating from the Excel file, there was an option to select to somehow have it included.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_01
 There was no way we could be like, yeah, I haven't included.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_01
 There was no way for us to have been down that it was really there.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_02
 I think we were just getting over in through the essay with the task.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_02
 It was interesting.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_02
 I got into it.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_02
 I was like, I'm designing a remote control.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_04
 It was interesting though that they put that 50% of people say they have frustration with losing their remote.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_04
 They didn't provide us with information too.

0:37:34	SPEAKER_04
 I know that people have things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_04
 I'm sure that would require some kind of technology that I just don't know what it is.

0:37:49	SPEAKER_02
 I think there are some of those in the commercial remotes that have things so you won't lose them.

0:37:55	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_02
 We were talking about it in my household at least.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_02
 There's only about two places that the remote is ever.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_02
 There's only one TV and there's only one TV.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_01
 That's the same you never got all these keys.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_01
 I always do anyway.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_01
 You lose them in your pocket.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_01
 You just won't forget that or you'll put it down somewhere that made sense.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_01
 Remember there's always ways to lose things?

0:38:19	SPEAKER_04
 It depends on how organized you are personally.

0:38:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I guess what the set of the house is too.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_02
 I am notorious for losing my keys.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_02
 I guess I've just never lost the remote.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_02
 I put my keys in the refrigerator the other day.

0:38:37	SPEAKER_02
 I find them putting groceries away.

0:38:46	SPEAKER_02
 You're taking stuff on the bag and putting them in the refrigerator.

0:38:49	SPEAKER_02
 In fact, my room can't get in.

0:38:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it can get in.

0:38:54	SPEAKER_04
 Look all around the kitchen.

0:38:56	SPEAKER_02
 Definitely in the vegetable drawer.

0:39:00	SPEAKER_01
 I always do the alleviate in my coat and using a different coat.

0:39:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yep.

0:39:07	SPEAKER_02
 I guess it's good we don't really carry robots around that much.

0:39:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_01
 Can't always take it into the other room.

0:39:16	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it was our little robot when we could have had a robot alien pair or whatever he is.

0:39:25	SPEAKER_02
 Have a little voice.

0:39:26	SPEAKER_02
 I am located.

0:39:28	SPEAKER_02
 A GPS.

0:39:31	SPEAKER_02
 A turtle GPS.

0:39:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:39:37	SPEAKER_02
 How about if it's sitting still for a minute?

0:39:40	SPEAKER_04
 We should make one that walks by itself.

0:39:43	SPEAKER_04
 It really could get up and walk away.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_04
 Or like some crazy like electro magnet that you push it in and it will go zoomed into the TV and stick there.

0:39:52	SPEAKER_02
 Or just a wheel, you know.

0:39:55	SPEAKER_02
 Just if you...

0:39:58	SPEAKER_02
 Why do you have to ever vote for your robot?

0:40:00	SPEAKER_04
 Well, but if you could attach them to the TV then you can do that.

0:40:06	SPEAKER_03
 I'll pass the possibility.

0:40:10	None
 Okay.

0:40:12	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry, I'm just trying to update my minutes.

0:40:22	SPEAKER_04
 I decided to...

0:40:23	SPEAKER_04
 You know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint in minutes will be complimentary.

0:40:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:40:27	SPEAKER_04
 So I'm just going to make a full minute so that it will include all of the agenda and all that.

0:40:33	SPEAKER_04
 Wow.

0:40:34	SPEAKER_04
 Because it seems a little more useful.

0:40:36	SPEAKER_02
 So you can look, the most typing and organizing to do.

0:40:41	SPEAKER_04
 But I didn't have like information to swap the area there.

0:40:44	SPEAKER_02
 So I guess.

0:40:46	SPEAKER_02
 How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you?

0:40:49	SPEAKER_04
 Every meeting.

0:40:50	SPEAKER_04
 Most of it.

0:40:51	SPEAKER_04
 I added slides.

0:40:53	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, I added a couple slides each time, but that was better.

0:40:57	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't think about adding slides because I would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all in.

0:41:03	SPEAKER_02
 Didn't even think about adding more.

0:41:05	SPEAKER_04
 Well, the thing was you would provide you an agenda with like several points, but it wouldn't have a slide for each point.

0:41:10	SPEAKER_04
 And that's the only way I remember that I need to go over that point.

0:41:13	SPEAKER_04
 I know personally when I do PowerPoint, that's what I do.

0:41:16	SPEAKER_04
 I had it once, even if it was just like the title of it, like the three presentations.

0:41:21	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not going to do anything right.

0:41:28	SPEAKER_01
 You have to have a slogan on it or can I just be like.

0:41:41	SPEAKER_01
 The slogan on it?

0:41:42	SPEAKER_01
 No, definitely.

0:41:44	SPEAKER_01
 It could go around the other side.

0:41:47	SPEAKER_02
 No, I don't think we need to.

0:41:51	SPEAKER_02
 It would be R and R.

0:41:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's definitely the yellow and black one.

0:41:56	SPEAKER_02
 Is it yellow or blue?

0:41:59	SPEAKER_04
 Or yellow and blue?

0:42:01	SPEAKER_04
 Let me go to the webpage.

0:42:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's just kind of going by the webpage because they didn't give me any clear.

0:42:06	SPEAKER_01
 Like yellow and red.

0:42:08	SPEAKER_01
 It's black.

0:42:09	None
 Great.

0:42:10	SPEAKER_02
 Better than black doesn't look so bumbly to you.

0:42:14	SPEAKER_01
 I really understand the reason I'm like news clubbing.

0:42:18	SPEAKER_02
 Finish meeting now.

0:42:21	SPEAKER_04
 Wasn't it interesting that I thought it was interesting that our marketing expert did not agree with the marketing choices.

0:42:32	SPEAKER_01
 I was just thinking you're really doing like a really big market evaluation.

0:42:37	SPEAKER_01
 You wouldn't just have like one set of the source.

0:42:41	SPEAKER_01
 They weren't so not backed up.

0:42:44	SPEAKER_01
 We did a survey.

0:42:45	SPEAKER_01
 This is what people said.

0:42:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:42:50	SPEAKER_02
 People are stupid.

0:42:52	SPEAKER_02
 I guess it's sort of like gray isn't it?

0:42:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yellow and gray but then the slogans and blue.

0:42:59	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we got some gray and we got some blue buttons.

0:43:02	SPEAKER_02
 We're good.

0:43:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:43:04	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we don't have the right color clay anyway.

0:43:06	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe it's like, I don't know.

0:43:08	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we're not sadly going to actually be producing this.

0:43:14	SPEAKER_01
 If they ever come out with potato, potato bag of the same fur votes.

0:43:20	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to have to clean it into electoral property.

0:43:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:43:24	SPEAKER_02
 I can't believe the whole day is done.

0:43:33	SPEAKER_02
 I don't feel like it's been out of here.

0:43:35	SPEAKER_02
 I can't suck this.

0:43:38	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:43:41	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sorry.
