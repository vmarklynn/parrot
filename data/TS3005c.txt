0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 How far do you find?

0:00:02	SPEAKER_02
 What's the door?

0:00:07	None
 Dude, dude, dude.

0:00:12	None
 What's the door?

0:00:19	SPEAKER_02
 Transmeter, huh?

0:00:21	SPEAKER_02
 Transmeter.

0:00:22	None
 Yeah.

0:00:23	None
 Yall.

0:00:25	None
 So, if you can say, if you can see here, like a little box, it's like a sheet of tape.

0:00:39	None
 That's also a door.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_04
 What's it called?

0:00:48	SPEAKER_01
 Transmeter.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_04
 JBL on the wall.

0:01:22	None
 JBL on the wall.

0:01:29	None
 No.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that's not good, right?

0:01:51	SPEAKER_02
 What in that queue?

0:02:04	None
 Move the meeting room and bring that door.

0:02:09	None
 It's like the internet drive.

0:02:12	None
 You have to say something.

0:02:13	None
 He's not always fast.

0:02:16	None
 No, no, no.

0:02:26	None
 I'm going to have to wait for you in the meantime, but I have to pay more attention.

0:02:31	None
 Yeah, I can talk to you.

0:02:35	None
 You should speak, you know.

0:02:38	None
 Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

0:02:53	None
 Sorry.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_03
 Have a trip.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, welcome everyone to our next meeting.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_03
 I have prepared a little presentation once again, or at least an agenda.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_03
 The biggest part of the presentation will be on your side.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_03
 We are here at the conceptual design meeting, which is here by opened.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_03
 Once again, I will try to write some minutes, which I just, from the previous meeting, placed inside our project folder, which was quite some typing.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_03
 Today, we once again have three presentations, if I'm right.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_03
 And after that, we will take a decision on the remote control concept.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_03
 And just as the last time we have 40 minutes to accomplish that.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, well, let's start with the first presentation in the same order as last time.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_03
 Take it away.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_02
 Bling.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, welcome.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_02
 You all.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_02
 Component design.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_02
 Before I would like to accommodate some of those things I elaborate some of the things I did.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_02
 I elaborated on the concept.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_02
 What should be said about the components, its properties and what kind of materials we use to make one of those remote controls?

0:05:11	SPEAKER_02
 First of all, I've subtracted some of the components that are used from what the remote control is formed.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_02
 First of all, the case, the case, the surrounding of the remote control.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_02
 I would like to give you an idea of how I thought about the true materials.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_02
 The materials gone there.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_02
 The case is made from rubber, I suppose, because when you use the remote control, a lot of people will drop the remote control in the break because the titanium was also an option.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_02
 But it's a very expensive material.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_02
 I think the best suitable material to use for remote control.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_02
 It's also possible to create fancy colors with rubber.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_02
 It makes it easy to let itself color.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_02
 Rubber, the total piece of rubber that's used to make the case is the same color.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_02
 If you scratch it, it's still the same color.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_02
 Perhaps it's a little bit damaged.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_02
 But it's a very strong material.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_02
 I had an idea. It's single curved.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_02
 It's too dimensional.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's best drawn green.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_00
 It's a color.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's a brass color.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_02
 New.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_02
 Forward blank.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_02
 Let's make it black.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_02
 I thought of an idea like this.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, not that.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_02
 Blank.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_02
 It also looks nice when it's on your table.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't lay flat down on the table, but it stands.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_02
 It's a side view.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, it's a side view.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not technically good at 3D modeling.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_02
 It's just an idea I had.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_02
 It also looks nice when it's on the table.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_02
 The graphical user interface and the buttons.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_02
 We also thought about that already.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_02
 I thought about the LCD touch screen, which is easy to clean too.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_02
 One of the great advantages of the LCD screen is just to use some classics or other cleaning stuff.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_02
 It should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_02
 I already explained some properties of that material.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_02
 I think, oh, you also almost concluded about that.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_02
 This should be our two button component.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_02
 That's all about the buttons.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_02
 We also thought about that already.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_02
 It will be chargeable with an option for a mount station.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_02
 You can put the remote control in a mount station.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_02
 It charges itself up instead of plugging it in or something like that.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_02
 Questions?

0:08:45	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no, no.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_02
 Just looking.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_02
 They should be long lasting.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_02
 Not via MTA in about two minutes or 30 minutes or 40 minutes of use.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_02
 The next step is the chip.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_02
 The component that makes or transmits the signal to the television.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_02
 There was an option to use a rather simple chip, but I think because of our highly requiring requirements.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_02
 There should be an advanced chip in it with also the ability to facilitate speech recognition.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_02
 Unfortunately, it's still in a test phase.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_02
 There should be some more investigation on that side.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_02
 My personal preference is, I also overheard in the last meeting that we should use our own business scholars.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_02
 That was correct, wasn't it?

0:09:44	SPEAKER_02
 I think they are rather boring for use with rubber.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_03
 Well, business scholars, I thought it was the slogan and the corporate image.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_02
 They should be in mind, wasn't it?

0:09:56	SPEAKER_03
 But I don't think you have to make the entire thing in there.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so it doesn't have to have the slogan recognized.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, okay.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that's possible, of course.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_02
 You could make a little R&R on the top of the machine.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_02
 So they are pretty boring, I suggest because the availability with rubber to make fantastic colors.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_02
 And also, in a lot of possible colors, so it's possible to make very fancy remote controls, which people, in which people will find their interesting.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_02
 And we'll buy them faster when they look at the same old gray or black colors.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_02
 As I said before, rubber is impossible to damage severely.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_02
 Instead of, of course, you can break it when you break it, for example, with paracysses or something like that.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_02
 But if you drop it, it's not broken right away.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_02
 Instead of using plastic, hard plastic or titanium.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_02
 And I personally like the single curved remote control.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_02
 Because it makes it fancy.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. Well, that's all about my findings.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, thank you.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_03
 I will go next.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_00
 All right, so I saw a little bit about the interface.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_00
 I should look.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_00
 The term that there will be no buttons, but only an LCD screen, so I have to look on that.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_00
 And the design is therefore based on what we just thought of.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_00
 First, there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_00
 And this is that you ask, you give a question through the device.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_00
 And it answers you.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_00
 And they already put this in a coffee maker.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_00
 And so that you say, good morning, coffee maker.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_00
 And it says, says, do you back?

0:12:12	SPEAKER_00
 Good morning, Joe, or what's your name?

0:12:15	SPEAKER_00
 This is an easy way to program that.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_00
 You say, record into the device, into the speaker.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_00
 And then you say the question and three seconds later, you say the answer.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_00
 And then when you say the question, it gives you the answer.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_00
 Perhaps it's useful, but because people lose the remote, they can yell.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_00
 Remote, where are you?

0:12:35	SPEAKER_00
 And that's because that calls for something.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_00
 And perhaps you could implement that.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_00
 And then I have to go out of the presentation, because I try to make some kind of ID or what you do, but I can draw.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_00
 Don't make too much of it.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_00
 I try to the LCD screen.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_00
 I try to draw.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_00
 I thought at least the icon for the volume.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if there's an icon for the program, but...

0:13:05	SPEAKER_00
 Just be.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, just be.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_00
 And then the buttons above and below, the mute button, also very nice, as an icon.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_05
 So what's the button for two digits?

0:13:19	SPEAKER_00
 I forgot that one.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_00
 I thought I forgot something.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_00
 And the numbers, it should be a bit larger, I think.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_00
 It's not really on scale and...

0:13:30	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_00
 An options button.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_00
 And I thought the button for the tail text apart, because it's not really options, I think.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_00
 Options are the settings of the remote and of the TV and that kind of thing.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_00
 You could call it settings or something.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_00
 But this is a bit how I thought it.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_00
 And the LCD somewhere on your remote, perhaps you could be more curvy to remote perhaps.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_00
 So that's better in your hand or something.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_00
 And a microphone for the speech recognition if you want to implement that.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_00
 And then if you press the options button, we have an example of...

0:14:14	SPEAKER_00
 And then you should get the other options with what you could do and that you could do with something like this.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_00
 It's also...

0:14:24	SPEAKER_00
 I think we discussed earlier that older people don't really want to use these extra settings.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_00
 And older people also don't really want to use this kind of option we use.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_00
 So they want to use one button and then something happens.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_00
 And not choose with this kind of...

0:14:44	SPEAKER_00
 And you could put a really scrolling device on the side of your remote.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_00
 So you could scroll across these things.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_00
 That's an option.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_00
 And that was my finding thing.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_03
 Thanks.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_03
 Third.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_04
 No daddy.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_03
 Remember this presentation.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_05
 I'm going to tell you something about the trend washing.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_05
 The trends from the past years, what people like, what youngsters like, what elderly people like, about shapes, colors, material and stuff.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_05
 The way that I use was...

0:15:41	SPEAKER_05
 Like I told, I watched the trends from past years about color shapes, material they wanted from elderly and young people.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_05
 So we can keep that in mind for designing the files itself.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_05
 Files are made.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_05
 The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look fancy.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_05
 The second important thing that should be enough in a fadive.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_05
 Like the LCD screen that's quite innovative.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_05
 So that should be great meeting for this.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_05
 And the third thing is it should be East Use.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_05
 I think with only one menu for button channel volume, it should also be enough for East Use.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_05
 The personal preferences for the young people, they liked fruity colors, like banana yellow, strawberry red and stuff.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_05
 Grass green.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, like that.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_05
 The round shapes and soft materials, like the rubber, it should be soft, it should be feeling spongy or sponge bob.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_00
 Like this.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_00
 Let's build it into a sponge.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_05
 Elderly people like colors which you are being seen in autumn, like wood, dark brown, red, deep red and stuff.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_05
 They like square shapes with round edges and hard materials like wood, titanium, those kind of materials they like.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_05
 This is a bit like the young people's like, the fruity colors, innovative, all the colors you see the blue, the red, the white, yellow, that stuff.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_05
 And then I personally thought a front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like this or something.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_05
 It's a bit like banana and the color should be yellow or something.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_05
 And for the elderly people just plain old because we decided to have two kind of remotes, two designs or was it two colors?

0:17:46	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, different colors, yeah. We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_05
 I think like my colleague, you said, is that it's better or for the elderly people something like the iPod or something with round squares.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_05
 Simple but easy to use.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_05
 So that's it.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_05
 That's why people are more traditional. Yeah, like the older colors I can maybe...

0:18:16	SPEAKER_00
 You could change the colors that was also the only shape you should take.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_03
 The colors are easy to change.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_02
 Change the shape of the old one.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_00
 Perhaps you could find something in the middle. Round corners but square.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe then both groups won't buy it.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_00
 If you do it square with round corners but a little in the middle.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_02
 I know what you mean, you kind of like a mouse bone.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_00
 Like this.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_00
 So it's a bit square but it's also a bit...

0:19:01	SPEAKER_02
 Kind of like a beer glass.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_00
 So but then...

0:19:06	SPEAKER_00
 I know what you mean. Same size.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_02
 It's also easy to put in your hand.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but it's also how other remotes are shaped.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_00
 So that's...

0:19:18	SPEAKER_00
 Perhaps that's good thing. So that's easy to use.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_00
 People know that.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_02
 We'll recognize that's a remote control.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_02
 What I saw in your...

0:19:26	SPEAKER_05
 Something like that. You know, autumn colors like red, brown.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_05
 They like the wood a lot.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_05
 So maybe we could give it like a wooden look or something.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_05
 A bit old-school style.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_05
 Red, suns, medieval.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_05
 That's what it's all about.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_05
 That's kind of things.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_05
 So you see the big difference between the young people.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_05
 Fresh, exciting.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_05
 And old people.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_05
 That's easy to look at.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_05
 So, sorry.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_00
 That's easy to do with the color.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I think it's easier to do in color than in shape.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_05
 Otherwise we have to get different shapes and colors just way easier than shapes.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_05
 And material, yeah, rubber.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_05
 Rubber is like I said, young people like more soft materials.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_05
 They're spongy ones.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_05
 And the old people like plain wood.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_05
 So we have to decide if we're going to use re-hards rubber or soft rubber.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_05
 Or something.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_05
 Something between that.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_05
 Soft rubber.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, soft rubber.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_05
 Which you can feel in it.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_05
 I know you.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_02
 No, I think you should be promoted.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_05
 No, or what should be next.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_05
 No, no, but you have to like like a erase or something.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_05
 That's a bit you can press it in or something harder.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_00
 But like this kind of rubber.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, something like this, yeah.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_00
 Quite hard.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yes, quite hard, but you can press it in.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_05
 It feels kind of spongy.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_05
 spongy.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_05
 Something like this.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_04
 No, think it's rubber.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_03
 So we need a spongy feeling.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_00
 If you have something.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to invite SpongeBob.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe he can.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_00
 So we should first decide about shape, I think.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think it's a better thing to do.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_00
 Then you can fit the LCD screen in it.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, I can't help it.

0:21:22	None
 I can't help it.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_02
 I also can't help it.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_02
 Notice, as you used, you had a remote control, but the LCD screen was rather small.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think the LCD screen should be like your size.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_02
 But I think it should be larger.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, three quarter of the, three quarters.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_02
 So you don't have to put your,

0:21:47	SPEAKER_05
 but it won't get that small when LCD screen is.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_02
 So when you got this. Can I like this?

0:22:06	SPEAKER_02
 Or should it be larger, I think.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_02
 Larger, because you want to put your hands.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because you can put your hands there.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_00
 And then you won't touch the screen.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, true, true, true, true.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_02
 You're thumb here.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_00
 But not on the screen, because.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_00
 That's all the side.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_00
 Because when you put your hands on it.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but if you make the LCD screen as large as the remote control itself, you always get some.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_02
 You always touch it.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_05
 You can be very greasy and stuff, but you won't get that small, because you have how much?

0:22:40	SPEAKER_05
 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 buttons on the screen.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_05
 You don't want it too small.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, how large?

0:22:48	SPEAKER_05
 You have to, you have to, because some fat people would thick fingers.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_05
 You have to keep your dress tree, but it's the same time.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_02
 Well, if you want to make it international, Japanese people get rather small hands.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, true, but we have the soul option.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_02
 Zoom option.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_02
 Of course.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_02
 You can make it larger with a company.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_02
 A greater feel to push the button.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_03
 And we won't include a pen or something to point.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_02
 What do you have a finger?

0:23:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_02
 Your fingers, yeah.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_02
 You lose a pen.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_02
 You lose a pen.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_02
 You lose a pen, you can't use it.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_03
 You can't use it with a finger.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_00
 You have to.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_00
 They think it's handy to use pen.

0:23:25	None
 Yeah.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_00
 I think this is a good size for the screen.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know how large the external remote should be with a bit.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_03
 And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all that.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but that can be used to put any soft tissue.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you can buy those.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_03
 If I can interrupt you, maybe I should show some points on which we should take a decision.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_03
 Sure.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_03
 So we can discuss these points.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_03
 Those points.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_03
 Energy question mark.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_03
 How should we supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do with separate docking station and then put accused in it?

0:24:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, chip on print and case. Those are points my coach advised me to discuss here, but I hope you have ideas about them.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_00
 I think energy or batteries and then the docking station.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so that's the first point to include rechargeable batteries.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_05
 Which you can recharge through the docking station.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_05
 So if the batteries are dead.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_02
 I kind of like you.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_02
 You've got some some of those wireless mice.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_02
 Computer mouse.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_02
 Kind of like those kind of batteries.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_00
 But it should be, I think, normal batteries.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, normal playing.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_05
 No, normal playing batteries.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_05
 You can buy the supermarket or refill.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_03
 Or be very rechargeable.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:55	None
 Batteries.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_00
 And what was with the chip on print?

0:25:01	SPEAKER_02
 The chip on print.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_02
 I think so.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_02
 Chip on print with a simple, yeah, simple, but we also discard that.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_02
 Didn't we?

0:25:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but how does that work with LCD screen?

0:25:20	SPEAKER_03
 You still have a...

0:25:22	SPEAKER_02
 You always have a print plate.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you, Juan.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_04
 You always have a print plate.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, sure, of course.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_04
 Always so.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know what we have to decide about that.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, it's a good question.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_03
 It was in there and I didn't have any...

0:25:39	SPEAKER_02
 Chip on print, I think what I mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got, it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_02
 But when you got an LCD screen, Yeah, okay.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_02
 With no...

0:25:52	SPEAKER_02
 With not...

0:25:53	SPEAKER_02
 The buttons are not always on the same place.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_02
 For example, if you enlarge a button, or if you got several options appearing on your screen, the code nations aren't always the same.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_02
 When you got a regular button, the button of standby is always on the same place.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_05
 And you get on the print plate of LCD screen, there's more at fault than the low print plate.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_05
 So that's not of any discussion, I think.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_03
 No, you need some kind of CPU, I guess.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_03
 I suppose so.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_02
 No, I don't know.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_05
 I don't think...

0:26:22	SPEAKER_02
 It is a simple CPU, where it is.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, okay.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_05
 But I don't know if...

0:26:28	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, because it has to...

0:26:30	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it's quite a simple LCD screen.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_05
 I think they don't need that...

0:26:34	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control has to know where you're in a settings menu, or just...

0:26:38	SPEAKER_02
 You just want to turn on the volume.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, okay, true.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_05
 True.

0:26:42	None
 True.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_02
 True.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_02
 So it has to have some kind of...

0:26:49	SPEAKER_02
 calculation unit on CPU, to know in which state you are, and which button you are pressing at the right moment.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_03
 Because we're projecting the buttons on the LCD screen.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's a touchscreen.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_02
 And the touchscreen makes it possible to get the coordination of your finger on screen.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_02
 In the case, yeah, we already discussed the case, so we wanted to make it from rubber.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_00
 But the hard rubber, like this, or softer rubber?

0:27:16	SPEAKER_02
 The hard rubber, I think.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_02
 That's easy to...

0:27:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_00
 I'm down to the back from the floor when you...

0:27:22	SPEAKER_00
 We have different colors.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, this is...

0:27:26	SPEAKER_05
 The shapes is something between square shapes with round shapes.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_05
 No, I don't think...

0:27:36	SPEAKER_05
 It's more round than square.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's a bit longer.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_00
 So it meets...

0:27:42	SPEAKER_05
 I think it meets more the young people than the older people.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but that's what we wanted.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's how it started to turn into a main target.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_05
 It's loaded for the years, I think.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know how about my idea of making it...

0:27:58	SPEAKER_02
 with one single curve.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, yeah, that's...

0:28:01	SPEAKER_05
 I think I thought that was quite...

0:28:04	SPEAKER_02
 Because it's a gadget, and you want to show it off, of course.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, you have a fancy design, right away.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_05
 You can put it on your table, with LCD screen.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_05
 You don't have to put it in your head.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_05
 You can put it next to you, and then...

0:28:16	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, that's good.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_05
 It's not easy.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:28:22	SPEAKER_02
 So you write that down, and you get a single curve, rubber, fancy colored, remote control.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, you can draw it on your paper, and then...

0:28:35	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, you can...

0:28:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I don't understand.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_04
 And load it on the...

0:28:41	SPEAKER_04
 the user, the server.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_03
 About the user interface, there are also some questions.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_03
 About the concepts, I think.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_03
 You have some ideas.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I have what I...

0:28:53	SPEAKER_00
 You showed you drawing.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_00
 I should...

0:28:55	SPEAKER_00
 Go...

0:28:56	SPEAKER_00
 Go again.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_00
 I miss a few buttons, but...

0:29:07	SPEAKER_00
 At least, you should also have...

0:29:09	SPEAKER_00
 I just remembered a menu to go back to the first...

0:29:14	SPEAKER_00
 but if you touch options, you can go back to this right away.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_00
 Now, the server...

0:29:21	SPEAKER_04
 Isn't it better to have the sound and the channel buttons horizontal?

0:29:26	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_00
 With the minus and the plus.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's easier than...

0:29:32	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_00
 I thought it was easier to handle this way, but I don't know what they think.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_00
 If you like the buttons, the horizontal vertical.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_02
 The horizontal screen, if you make the screen vertical, it does not matter.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_02
 If you make it in a rectangle.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if you make it like this...

0:29:53	SPEAKER_00
 So, if you...

0:29:55	SPEAKER_00
 Put it like this...

0:29:56	SPEAKER_00
 Where?

0:29:58	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's easier to have it...

0:30:01	SPEAKER_05
 something like...

0:30:03	SPEAKER_05
 the button minus here...

0:30:06	SPEAKER_05
 plus over here...

0:30:09	SPEAKER_05
 minus here...

0:30:11	SPEAKER_05
 plus over here...

0:30:13	SPEAKER_05
 and on here...

0:30:15	SPEAKER_05
 the other buttons...

0:30:17	SPEAKER_05
 and on here...

0:30:18	SPEAKER_05
 the top...

0:30:20	SPEAKER_05
 the options...

0:30:21	SPEAKER_00
 But I think...

0:30:22	SPEAKER_05
 And then you have something like the B over here...

0:30:26	SPEAKER_05
 and the sound...

0:30:29	None
 I think that's another one you're used to.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_00
 I think I would put a plus in the middle here...

0:30:35	SPEAKER_00
 and then the P in the middle and the sound...

0:30:38	SPEAKER_00
 and then the P in the middle and the sound...

0:30:41	SPEAKER_00
 Something like...

0:30:44	SPEAKER_05
 Something like...

0:30:47	None
 Shit.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_02
 Take your time.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_04
 Plus, minus, plus...

0:31:00	SPEAKER_04
 Oh!

0:31:02	SPEAKER_00
 Almost.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, I think when you're holding it, you could press the minus in the plus...

0:31:10	SPEAKER_00
 and with the other finger, the minus in the plus.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I think you're going to...

0:31:16	SPEAKER_05
 you're going to use it with one sound.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_00
 But I think...

0:31:20	SPEAKER_00
 perhaps I have some...

0:31:22	SPEAKER_02
 Will you use the build engineering there?

0:31:24	SPEAKER_04
 Who's the usability engineering?

0:31:26	SPEAKER_04
 She...

0:31:28	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to do some examples.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_00
 Because perhaps you should choose what's most often used.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_00
 Because we can use that better.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_05
 Consistency.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, I have that...

0:31:39	SPEAKER_04
 those numbers.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, I have...

0:31:43	SPEAKER_04
 What good work.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_03
 I don't really know.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_03
 Everybody is searching in a tunnel selection.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_05
 Per hour, 168, volume selection, four times...

0:31:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but I mean if it's usually plus or minus, above each other, of next to each other, I don't know how to reload.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_02
 Not much often is used, but...

0:32:04	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, I thought you were doing what's on the remote.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_00
 Looking here, but here's...

0:32:10	SPEAKER_00
 Below, here also, you know, here's next to each other.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's...

0:32:17	SPEAKER_05
 I think, because I have two televisions at home, one is horizontal, one is vertical.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it doesn't really matter.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_05
 Tick-picks.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_00
 I think the volume is usually above each other, because you go higher and down.

0:32:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, lower.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_00
 And the program is next to each other, because you go further and back.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_01
 Hmm.

0:32:44	None
 True.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_00
 That's how it is usually.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's how I look here.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, let's see.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_02
 Let's cut the chase.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, I think we don't have to decide about that now, how well we will put the button.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_05
 It is usually at the face.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_05
 It's confident.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_00
 There's actually a design, you should know where you would play.

0:33:14	None
 Okay, well...

0:33:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_02
 Interface, yeah.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_00
 And the speech, shall we implement that?

0:33:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, we just heard about the new...

0:33:25	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I think it's easy for that to wear, or you would then just sit down here.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_00
 Thanks for the book.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_00
 But then you should also find a place.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_00
 If you do it like this, you could put it in a corner or something.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_00
 You can talk into the corner.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, microphone.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_02
 Not even necessary, because you can make a very sensitive microphone to make it possible to just put it around underneath it or on the bottom of it.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, maybe at the bottom where you can hold it with your hands, and there's also a microphone over there.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:33:55	SPEAKER_02
 That's not important.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's not very important, because it doesn't matter where the microphone is.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_00
 But you should decide where you are.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, I should.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_04
 I think where it isn't seen the most,

0:34:10	SPEAKER_02
 indeed, it shouldn't be very visible.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_00
 You put it in a logo of the country. Yeah, shit.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_05
 No, maybe just in between the round of the R.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because I think it should be in an important position where people can see it, because it is the unique idea of our remote, the speech control.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_03
 Where you want to put it?

0:34:29	SPEAKER_03
 Well, maybe it's where...

0:34:30	SPEAKER_02
 And it doesn't make it any more fancy, because you get to see...

0:34:33	SPEAKER_00
 It does, because you can find it better if you use it.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but...

0:34:38	SPEAKER_00
 It's a way for you to...

0:34:40	SPEAKER_00
 So it makes more fancy, because other remote don't have that.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_03
 But are we talking about the button or about the microphone?

0:34:47	SPEAKER_03
 The microphone.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_03
 There is no button.

0:34:49	SPEAKER_03
 I like the one. It's very small thing, but you can make it look like it's big, so it's really an important function of the remote.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_05
 I think the left corner should be the best.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_05
 Where it isn't...

0:35:05	SPEAKER_05
 It isn't most inside.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:08	None
 I think...

0:35:09	SPEAKER_02
 Well, put it there.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_02
 I don't mind.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't really matter.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_04
 Actually, does it...

0:35:18	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_02
 So?

0:35:20	SPEAKER_02
 Any more...

0:35:21	SPEAKER_03
 So, well, type...

0:35:24	SPEAKER_03
 Supplements?

0:35:25	SPEAKER_02
 Interface type?

0:35:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, well...

0:35:27	SPEAKER_03
 We already discussed it.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_03
 The LCD, yeah.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_02
 Supplements...

0:35:30	SPEAKER_05
 I think...

0:35:32	SPEAKER_05
 Like you said, scroll...

0:35:34	SPEAKER_05
 Next to the remote...

0:35:36	SPEAKER_05
 Isn't that handy?

0:35:37	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's better to just type what you'd like to do on the screen.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_05
 If you want to go back, if a back button goes back, if you want to choose audio settings, press all your settings, and it goes to that sub menu.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_02
 That's my name to defend.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_00
 The young people do like this...

0:35:57	SPEAKER_02
 You used to scroll.

0:35:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_02
 So, why not?

0:36:00	SPEAKER_02
 On...

0:36:01	SPEAKER_02
 On-side.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_00
 Or at least, yeah, I don't know after you scroll, but the menu aren't changed that they like most.

0:36:06	SPEAKER_00
 And I think you can navigate through a menu with a scroll.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think you've got a settings...

0:36:12	SPEAKER_00
 It's faster.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_05
 I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_05
 But if you don't have a lot of options...

0:36:17	SPEAKER_05
 Yes, yes.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_05
 You have a lot of options.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_02
 Because when you use...

0:36:20	SPEAKER_02
 When you use the settings menu, for example, to look up some...

0:36:23	SPEAKER_02
 Some channels on your...

0:36:25	SPEAKER_02
 on your television.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_02
 You should scroll down...

0:36:28	SPEAKER_02
 on a menu, which probably does not fit on your screen.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_02
 So, then it's very handy to scroll down.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_02
 You make just a rubber just like on your mouse, or just put it on a side, and it's very easy to use.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, no problem.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_03
 And I think it will make it even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side,

0:36:49	SPEAKER_00
 which... It's also different.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_03
 Well, there's our five minutes...

0:36:57	SPEAKER_03
 warning.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_03
 Any more questions about design?

0:37:01	SPEAKER_03
 Or do you need to face...

0:37:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, components, everyone.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_04
 Color, sword, clear...

0:37:07	SPEAKER_04
 And what do you think?

0:37:09	SPEAKER_02
 The material is clear.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, what's the standard color?

0:37:11	SPEAKER_02
 The standard.

0:37:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we don't...

0:37:13	SPEAKER_02
 No, we have different color.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_02
 How many colors do we have?

0:37:15	SPEAKER_02
 We have different colors, but you should have a standard color.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_02
 I think black.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, black.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_02
 Black, I think.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_02
 With a yellow...

0:37:21	SPEAKER_05
 Darker, something like this.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_05
 This color or something.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_02
 And just a regular...

0:37:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, like...

0:37:26	SPEAKER_02
 And then have different...

0:37:28	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's better to have silver nowadays.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_05
 Silver, yeah.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's a few more silver...

0:37:33	SPEAKER_02
 See a lot of silver,

0:37:34	SPEAKER_05
 a lot of black.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the silver, it's silver, black, our own big colors.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_05
 I think we have silver, black, and between those...

0:37:41	SPEAKER_05
 Like, I don't know...

0:37:43	SPEAKER_05
 Five colors between the...

0:37:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, what about a yellow thing?

0:37:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_03
 It's better to have yellow, you have...

0:37:49	SPEAKER_03
 We ugly, but it's definitely fancy.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_02
 Red.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's right.

0:37:53	SPEAKER_02
 Green.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_02
 With silver.

0:37:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_02
 Rubber...

0:37:58	SPEAKER_02
 Silver rubber isn't fancy.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_04
 True?

0:38:01	SPEAKER_02
 When you use titanium, silver is fancy, but when you use silver rubber, it's fancy.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_02
 Silver has to shine, and rubber doesn't shine.

0:38:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_02
 Especially when you just made a soft rubber like this.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_02
 You understand?

0:38:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I understand.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I would think about colors like red, yellow, blue,

0:38:20	SPEAKER_05
 yeah, of course, the fruity colors. And the autumn colors, like red and brown.

0:38:25	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, dark red and brown, maroon.

0:38:28	None
 Yeah.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so...

0:38:31	SPEAKER_00
 And do I have to have a normal black one or...

0:38:34	SPEAKER_03
 Who's it?

0:38:35	SPEAKER_03
 Pinking.

0:38:36	SPEAKER_03
 No, I don't think.

0:38:37	SPEAKER_03
 Pinking.

0:38:38	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so that wraps it up.

0:38:40	SPEAKER_03
 Everybody knows what to do.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I don't know what to do.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know what to do.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_01
 I would have done what to do.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_03
 The next meeting is once again in 30 minutes.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_03
 Here are the individual actions, and especially notice that the industrial design and usually the interfaces are going to work together on a prototype, a smart board, and of course, to all four of us specific instructions will be emailed by a personal coach.

0:39:07	SPEAKER_00
 We'll work together, but do we have to stay here or do we?

0:39:10	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I'd say just wait for an email and find out.

0:39:14	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:39:15	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:39:16	SPEAKER_03
 I think we should work.

0:39:17	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, well, that was what I had to say.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_03
 Final thoughts from anyone or...

0:39:21	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:39:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, well, thank you very much.

0:39:24	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:39:25	SPEAKER_05
 How finished?

0:39:26	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you very much.

0:39:27	SPEAKER_00
 So, I was thinking, I'm finished now.

0:39:29	None
 I think I'll just wait for the things or the emails to get.

0:39:34	None
 I'll make a new one for you.

0:39:37	None
 Thanks.

0:39:38	None
 All right, face out.

0:39:40	None
 Bye.

0:39:41	None
 Okay, well, I'll try to put the minutes in the project folder as soon as possible.

0:39:47	None
 Okay.

0:39:48	None
 Hopefully, faster this time.

0:39:50	None
 Okay, good luck.

0:39:52	None
 Well, everything is clear.

0:39:56	None
 Is that here?

0:39:57	None
 Here, for fun.

0:39:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, this is a smart board.

0:40:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:40:01	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:40:02	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, bye.
