0:03:07	SPEAKER_00
 A tree.

0:03:08	None
 Happy Tree Frats.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. Welcome everyone to our next meeting.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_03
 next meeting, I'm busy writing and busy leading the meeting, but I've prepared a little presentation.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_03
 Once again, or at least an agenda, I think the biggest part of the presentation will be on your side.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_03
 We are here at the conceptual design meeting, which is hereby opened.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_03
 Once again, I will try to write some minutes, which I just, from a previous meeting, placed inside our project folder, which was quite some typing.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_03
 Today, we once again have three presentations, if I'm right.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_03
 And after that, we will take a decision on the remote control concept, and just as the last time we have 40 minutes to accomplish that.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, well, let's start with the first presentation in the same order as last time.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, I'll take it away.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_02
 Bling.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, and welcome.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_02
 You all.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_02
 Compartment design.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_02
 First of all, I'd like to accommodate some of those things.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_02
 I'll elaborate some of the things I did.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_02
 I'll elaborate it on the concept.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_02
 What should be said about the components, its properties, and what kind of material we use to make one of those remote controls.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_02
 First of all, I've subtracted some of the components that are used from what the remote control has formed.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_02
 First of all, the case, the case, the surrounding of the remote control.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_02
 I would like to give you an idea of how I thought about doing this through which one.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sure I was going there.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, the case is made from rubber, I suppose, because when you use remote control, a lot of people will drop their remote control in the break, because the titanium was also an option, but it's a very expensive material.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_02
 Rubber is, I think, the best suitable material to use for remote control.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_02
 It's also possible to create fancy colors with rubber.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_02
 Rubber makes it easy to let itself color.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_02
 Titanium, you have to paint it, and with that it's possible to scratch it or make it ugly.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_02
 Rubber, the total piece of rubber that's used to make the case is the same color, so if you scratch it, it's still the same color.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_02
 Perhaps it's a little bit damaged, but it's a very strong material.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_02
 I had an idea, it's single curved, sorry, it's single curved, so it's two-dimensional.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's best to draw a green.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_00
 It's a color.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_02
 A brush color.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_02
 A new forward blank.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_02
 I thought of an idea like this.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_02
 That's that.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_02
 Blank.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_02
 It also looks nice when it's on your table.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't lay flat down on the table, but it stands.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_02
 It's a size few.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not technically good at 3D modeling.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_02
 It's just an idea I had, so it's also looks nice when it's on the table.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_02
 The graphical user interface and the buttons, we also thought about that already.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_02
 I thought about the LCD touchscreen, which is easy to clean too.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_02
 I thought it was a great advantage of the LCD screen to just use some ClosX or another cleaning stuff.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_02
 It should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_02
 I already explained some properties of that material.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_02
 I think we also almost concluded about that.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_02
 This should be our two-button component.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_02
 That's all about the buttons.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_02
 The batteries we also thought about that already will be chargeable with an option for a mount station, so you can put the remote control in a mount station so it charges itself up instead of plugging it in or something like that.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_02
 Questions?

0:08:47	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_02
 It should be empty in about two minutes or 30 minutes or 40 minutes of use.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_02
 Next step is the chip, the component that makes or transmits the signal to the television.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_02
 There was an option to use a rather simple chip, but I think because of our highly requiring requirements, there should be an advanced chip in it and also the ability to facilitate speech recognition, which unfortunately is still in a test phase.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_02
 There should be some more investigation on that side.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_02
 My personal preference is also overheard in the last meeting that we should use our own business colors.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_02
 That was correct, wasn't it?

0:09:44	SPEAKER_02
 I think they are rather boring for use with rubber.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_03
 Well, business colors, I thought it was the slogan and the corporate image.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_02
 They should be in mind, wasn't it?

0:09:57	SPEAKER_03
 But I don't think you have to make the entire thing in there.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so it doesn't says to have the slogan.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_02
 It's very recognizable.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, okay, well, that's possible, of course.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_02
 You could make a little R&R on the top of the machine.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_02
 So, they are pretty boring, I suggest because of the availability with rubber to make fantastic colors and also in a lot of possible colors.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_02
 So, it's possible to make very fancy remote controls, which people, in which people will find their interesting.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_02
 And we'll buy faster when they look at the same old grey or black colors.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_02
 As I said before, rubber is impossible to damage severely.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_02
 Instead of, of course, you can break it when you break it.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_02
 For example, with a pair of scissors or something like that.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_02
 But if you drop it, it's not broken right away instead of using plastic, or hard plastic or titanium.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_02
 And I personally liked the single curved remote control because it makes it fancy.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, well, that's all about my findings.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, thank you.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_03
 I will go next.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_00
 All right, so I saw a little bit about the interface.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_00
 I should look.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_00
 We determined that there will be no buttons, but only on the LCD screen.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_00
 So, I had to look on that.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_00
 And the design is therefore based on what we just thought of.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_00
 First, there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_00
 And this is that you give a question through the device.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_00
 And it answers you.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_00
 And they already put this in a coffee maker.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_00
 And so that you say, good morning coffee maker and it says to you back, good morning, Joe, or what's your name?

0:12:15	SPEAKER_00
 There's an easy way to program that.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_00
 You say record into the device, into the speaker, and then you say the question and three seconds later, you say the answer, and then when you say the question, it gives you the answer.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_00
 Perhaps it's useful, because people lose the remote, they can yell remote.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_00
 Where are you?

0:12:35	SPEAKER_00
 And that's the goal or something.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_00
 That's true.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_00
 Perhaps we could implement that.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_00
 And then I have to go out of the presentation because I tried to make some kind of idea of how to do plaque, but I can draw, so don't.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_00
 I don't watch your head.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_00
 I tried to the LCD screen, I tried to draw.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_00
 I thought at least the icon for the volume.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if there's an icon for the program, but.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_00
 No, just P.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_00
 So, and then the buttons above and below.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_00
 The mute button also very nice, but there's an icon.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_05
 Where's the button for two digits?

0:13:19	SPEAKER_00
 I forgot that one.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_00
 I thought I forgot something.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_00
 And the numbers, it should be a bit larger, I think.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_00
 It's not really on scale and so forth.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_00
 An options button.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_00
 And I thought that the button for the teal text apart, because it's not really options, I think.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_00
 Options is the settings of the remote and of the TV and that kind of thing.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_00
 You could call it settings or something.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_00
 But this is a bit how I thought.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_00
 And the LCD somewhere on your remote, perhaps you could be more curvy to remote.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_00
 So that it's better in your hand or something.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_00
 And microphone for the speech recognition if you want to implement that.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_00
 And then if you press the options button, then we have an example of, and then you should get the other options with what you could do with something like this.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_00
 And it's also, I think we discussed earlier that older people don't really want to use these extra settings.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_00
 And older people also don't really want to use this kind of option we use.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_00
 So they want to use one button and then something happens and not choose with this kind of option.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_00
 And you could put a little scrolling device on the side of your remote so you could scroll across these things.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_00
 That's an option.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_00
 That was my finding thing.

0:14:59	None
 Thanks.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_03
 No, no Danny.

0:15:14	None
 Okay.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_05
 I'm going to tell you something about the trend watching.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_05
 The trends from the past years, what people like, what the youngsters like, what the only people like about shapes, colors, material and stuff.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_05
 The minute I use was, like I told, I watched the trends from past years about color shapes, material they wanted from elderly and young people.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_05
 So you can keep that in mind for designing the device itself.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_05
 Finally I made the most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look fancy.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_05
 The second important thing that should be innovative, like the LCD screen is quite innovative.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_05
 So that should be a great meeting for this.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_05
 And the third thing is it should be easy to use.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_05
 I think with only one menu for button channel volume, it should also be enough for easy to use.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_05
 The personal preferences for the young people, they liked fruity colors like banana yellow, strawberry red and stuff.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_05
 Grass green.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_05
 Like that.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_05
 The round shapes and soft materials, materials like the rubber, it should be soft, it should be feeling spongy or a spongebob like this.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_00
 That's really interesting.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_05
 Elderly people like colors which are being seen in autumn like wood, dark brown, deep red and stuff.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_05
 They like square shapes with round edges and hot materials like wood, titanium, those kind of materials they liked.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_05
 This is a bit like the young people's like, the fruity colors, innovative, all the colors you see, the blue, the red, the white, yellow, that stuff.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_05
 And then I personally thought a front side of the shape should be something for the young people's like this or something.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_05
 It's a bit like banana and the color should be yellow or something.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_05
 And for elderly people just plain old because we decided to have two kind of remotes to designs or was it two colors?

0:17:46	SPEAKER_05
 Different colors, yeah.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_05
 We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_05
 I think like my colleague, you said, is that better or for the elderly people something like the iPod or something with round squares.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_05
 Simple but easy to use.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_05
 So that's it.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_05
 That is nice.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_05
 Some people are more traditional, like the older colors.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_00
 You could change your colors, but also the yellow.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know which shape you should take.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_03
 The color's the yellow.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I guess changing colors will be easier than changing.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_02
 Change the shape of the image.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_00
 Perhaps you could find something in the middle.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_00
 Round squares.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_02
 Round corners, but square, yeah.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe then both groups won't buy it.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_00
 If you do it square with round corners, but in the middle of it.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I know what you mean.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_02
 Kind of like a...

0:18:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, whatever.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_00
 Like this.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_00
 So it's a bit square, but it's also a bit...

0:19:01	SPEAKER_02
 Kind of like a beer glass.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_00
 So, but then...

0:19:06	SPEAKER_00
 I know what you mean.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_00
 Same size.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_02
 It's also easy to put in your hand.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but it's also how other remotes are shaped.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_00
 So that's a good thing.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_00
 So that's easy to use.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_00
 People know that.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_02
 We'll recognize that as a remote control.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_02
 What I saw in your...

0:19:26	SPEAKER_05
 Look, something like that.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_05
 Out of colors, like red, brown.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_05
 They like the wood a lot.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe we could give it like a wooden look or something.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_04
 Kind of old colors.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_05
 A bit old school style.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_05
 Red, sun, medieval colors.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_05
 It's all together.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_05
 Those kind of things.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_05
 So you see the big difference between the young people.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_05
 Fresh, exciting, and old people.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_05
 So that's easy to do with color.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_05
 So, sorry?

0:19:56	SPEAKER_00
 That's easy to do with the color.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I think it's easier to do in color than in shape.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_05
 Otherwise, we have to get different shapes.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_05
 And colors are way easier than shapes.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_05
 And material, yeah, rubber.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_05
 Rubber is, like I said, young people like more soft materials, and spongy ones, and the old people like plain wood.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_05
 So we have to decide if we're going to use really hard rubber or soft rubber or something.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_05
 Something we can see in that.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_05
 Also in between.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_05
 Soft rubber, which you can feel in.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think you should promote it.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_05
 Or what should not be on the next question.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_05
 No, no, but you have to like erase or something.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_05
 That's a bit you can press it in or something harder.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_00
 But like this kind of rubber.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, something like this.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_00
 This is quite hard.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it's quite hard, but you can press it in.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_05
 It feels kind of spongy.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_05
 Spongy.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_04
 Something.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_00
 No, think it's rubber.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_03
 So we need a spongy feeling.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_00
 If you have spongy.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to infact spongy, but maybe you can.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_00
 So we should first decide about shape, I think.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think it's the better thing to do.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_00
 Then you can fit the LCD screen in it.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, Moses.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to start with that.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_02
 I also can't help but notice.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_02
 As you used, you had a remote control, but the LCD screen was rather small.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_02
 I think the LCD screen should be larger.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_02
 But I think it should be larger.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, three quarters.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_02
 So you don't have to put your buttons.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_05
 But it won't get that small.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_05
 What LCD screen is.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_02
 So when you get this.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_02
 Can I like this?

0:22:06	SPEAKER_02
 Or should it be larger?

0:22:08	SPEAKER_02
 Larger, I think.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_02
 Larger?

0:22:10	SPEAKER_02
 Because you want to put your hand.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because you can't put your hand there.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_00
 And then you won't touch the screen.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_04
 True, true, true, true.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_04
 You're thumb here.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_00
 But not on the screen.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_00
 Because when you put your...

0:22:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but if you make the LCD screen as large as the remote control itself, you always get some...

0:22:34	SPEAKER_02
 You always touch it.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_05
 You're going to be very greasy and stuff.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_05
 But it won't get that small because you have how much?

0:22:39	SPEAKER_05
 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 buttons on the screen.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_05
 1, 2, 0.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_05
 You don't want it to take it too small.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, how large?

0:22:49	SPEAKER_05
 You have to...

0:22:50	SPEAKER_05
 Because some fat people would think fingers.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_05
 I think you're just three buttons.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_02
 So you're going to...

0:22:55	SPEAKER_02
 Well, if you want to make it international, Japanese people get rather small hands.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, true.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_02
 But we would love...

0:23:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we have the zoom option.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_02
 Right?

0:23:02	SPEAKER_02
 The zoom option?

0:23:03	SPEAKER_02
 Of course.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_02
 You can make it larger with accompanying a greater field to push the button.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_03
 And we won't include a pen or something to point.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_02
 I think we won't do her fingers.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_02
 Your fingers.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_02
 Because you lose a pen.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_02
 You lose a pen.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_02
 You lose a pen.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_03
 You can't use...

0:23:20	SPEAKER_00
 You can't use...

0:23:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_00
 They think it's handling the use pen.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_00
 I think this is a good size for the screen.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know how large the actual remote should be.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all that.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but that can be a good point.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_03
 Any soft glove.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_03
 You can buy those.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_03
 If I can interrupt you, maybe I should show some points on which we should take a decision.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_03
 Sure.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_03
 So we can discuss these points.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_03
 There are those points.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_03
 Energy question mark.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_03
 How should we supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do a separate docking station and then put a cues in it.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_03
 Chip on print and case.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_03
 Those are points my coach advised me to discuss here.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_03
 But I hope you have ideas about them.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_00
 I think you were batteries and then...

0:24:18	SPEAKER_00
 The docking station.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_05
 So that's the first point we'll include rechargeable batteries which you can recharge through docking station.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_05
 So if two batteries are dead.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_05
 I kind of like your...

0:24:33	SPEAKER_02
 Change them.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_02
 Hey, you got some of those wireless mice.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_01
 Computer mice.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_02
 There you go.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_02
 Kind of like those kind of batteries.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_00
 But it should be, I think, normal batteries.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_00
 Not like to...

0:24:48	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, normal plane.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_05
 Normal plane batteries.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_05
 You can buy the supermarket or rechargeable.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:55	None
 Yeah.

0:24:56	None
 Yeah.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_00
 And what was with the chip on print?

0:25:00	SPEAKER_00
 The chip on print.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_02
 You got...

0:25:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:04	None
 I think so.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_02
 Chip on print with a...

0:25:06	SPEAKER_02
 With a...

0:25:11	SPEAKER_02
 Simple...

0:25:12	SPEAKER_02
 Not a simple but...

0:25:14	SPEAKER_02
 We also discard that, didn't we?

0:25:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_03
 How does that work with LCD screen?

0:25:20	SPEAKER_03
 You still have a...

0:25:23	SPEAKER_02
 Print...

0:25:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_04
 You always have a print plate.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you, Juan.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_04
 You always have a print plate light.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, sure, of course.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_04
 Always.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_04
 So...

0:25:32	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know what we have to decide about that.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, it's a good question.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_03
 It was in there and I didn't...

0:25:39	SPEAKER_02
 Chip on print, I think what I mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got, it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_02
 But when you got an LCD screen...

0:25:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_02
 With no...

0:25:52	SPEAKER_02
 With not...

0:25:53	SPEAKER_02
 The buttons are not always on the same place.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_02
 For example, if you enlarge a button, or if you got several options appearing on your screen, then the code donations aren't always the same.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_02
 When you get a regular button, the button of standby is always on the same place.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but...

0:26:10	SPEAKER_05
 And you get on a print plate of LCD screen less more advanced than a normal print plate.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_05
 So that's not of any discussion, I think.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_03
 No, you need some kind of CPU, I guess.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_02
 I suppose so.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_05
 I don't think...

0:26:23	SPEAKER_02
 It is a simple CPU, but it is...

0:26:25	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, okay, but I don't know if...

0:26:28	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, because it has to be...

0:26:30	SPEAKER_05
 It's quite a simple LCD screen.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_05
 I think the only...

0:26:34	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control has to know where you're in the settings menu or just...

0:26:38	SPEAKER_02
 You just want to turn on the volume.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, okay, true.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_05
 True.

0:26:42	None
 True.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_02
 True.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_02
 So it has to have some kind of...

0:26:48	SPEAKER_02
 Calculation unit or CPU...

0:26:51	SPEAKER_02
 To know in which state you are and which button you are pressing it at the right moment.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_03
 Because we're projecting the buttons on the LCD screen.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_02
 And the touchscreen makes it possible to get coordination of your finger on the screen.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_02
 In the case, yeah, we already discussed the case, so we wanted to make it from rubber.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_00
 But it's a hard rubber like this or a softer rubber.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_02
 A hard rubber, I think.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_02
 That's easy to add to that.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_00
 It bounces back from the floor where you...

0:27:22	SPEAKER_00
 We have different colors.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, this is a little show.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_05
 The shapes is something between square shapes with round corners and round shapes.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_05
 No, I don't think.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's more routes than square.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's a bit...

0:27:40	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a bit longer.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_05
 I think it meets more the young people than the older people.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but that's what we wanted.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's our target.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_02
 It's our main target.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_05
 Load it for the years, I think.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_02
 Well, and how about my idea of making it with one single curve?

0:27:59	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, yeah, that's cool.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_05
 I think I thought that was quite good.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_02
 Because it's a gadget and you want to show it off, of course.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you have a fancy design right away.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_05
 You can put it on your table with LCD screen.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_05
 You don't have to put it in your head.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_05
 You can put it next to you and then, then, then, then, it will...

0:28:16	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, that's cool.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_02
 It's not easier.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_02
 So, you can write that down and get a single curve.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_02
 Rubber.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_02
 Fancy colored.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_02
 You can't remote control.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_05
 You can't...

0:28:32	SPEAKER_05
 Or you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the...

0:28:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you can...

0:28:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I don't understand.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_04
 And load it on the user, the server.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_03
 And about the user interface, there are also some...

0:28:48	SPEAKER_03
 Some questions about the concepts.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_03
 I think you have some ideas.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I...

0:28:53	SPEAKER_00
 You showed your drawing.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_00
 I should go through it again.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_00
 I missed a few buttons.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_00
 At least...

0:29:08	SPEAKER_00
 You should also have...

0:29:09	SPEAKER_00
 I just remembered a menu to go back through the first...

0:29:14	SPEAKER_00
 But if you touch options, you can go back to the...

0:29:17	SPEAKER_00
 You can go back to this right away now, this...

0:29:21	SPEAKER_04
 Isn't it better to have the sound and the channel buttons horizontal?

0:29:26	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_00
 With the minus and the plus.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's...

0:29:30	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_00
 I thought it was easier to handle this way, but I don't know what they think.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_00
 Would you like the buttons horizontal or vertical?

0:29:43	SPEAKER_02
 Or south and...

0:29:47	SPEAKER_02
 It turns on the screen, if you make the screen vertical, it doesn't matter.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_00
 If you make it in a rectangle...

0:29:52	SPEAKER_00
 If we make it like this...

0:29:57	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's easier to have it.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_05
 Something like...

0:30:05	SPEAKER_05
 But the minus here plus over here.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_05
 And on here...

0:30:14	SPEAKER_05
 The other buttons and on here...

0:30:18	SPEAKER_05
 The top...

0:30:20	SPEAKER_05
 The options.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_05
 And then you have something like the P over here.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_05
 And the sound.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's not what you're used to.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_00
 I think I'll put a plus in the middle here.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_00
 And then the P in the middle and the sound.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_05
 Something like...

0:30:46	None
 Shit.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_02
 Take your time.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_04
 Plus, minus, plus...

0:31:01	SPEAKER_04
 Almost.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_00
 I think when you're holding it, you could press the minus and the plus and with the other fingers.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I think you're going to use it with one thumb.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_00
 Perhaps I have some examples in the room.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_02
 Will you adapt to the usability engineering?

0:31:27	SPEAKER_00
 I've got some examples.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_00
 Perhaps you should choose what's most often used.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_00
 Because we can use that better.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_05
 That I have those numbers.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_04
 I don't really know.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_05
 Channel selection per hour, 168.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_05
 Volume selection four times an hour.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_00
 But I mean if it's usually plus or above each other or next to each other.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_02
 Not how often it's used.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_00
 That depends on the remote.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_00
 Here's next to each other.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's...

0:32:18	SPEAKER_05
 I think I have two televisions in the home.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_05
 Or a cell to what is vertical.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_05
 It doesn't really matter.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_00
 I think the volume is usually above each other because you go higher and down.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_00
 The program is next to each other because you go further and back.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_00
 That's how it's usually.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_02
 Let's go to the chase.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have to decide about that now where we will put the button.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_05
 It is user interface.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_00
 It's complicated.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_00
 It's in the actual design.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_01
 You should know where you move places.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_00
 Interface.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_03
 We just heard about the new...

0:33:25	SPEAKER_05
 It's easy for that.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_00
 Or you would like to put it in a corner or something.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_00
 You can talk into the corner.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_02
 Not even necessary because you can make a very sensitive microphone.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_02
 It's impossible to put it underneath it or on the bottom.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe at the bottom where you can hold it with your hand.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_03
 That's not important.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's not very important.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't matter where the microphone is.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_04
 I think where it isn't seen the most.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_00
 It shouldn't be very un-fiscible.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_05
 It's put it in a logo of the company.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_03
 It's just between the round of the art.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_03
 It should be an important position where people can see it because it is the unique idea of our remote.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_03
 Why do you want to put it?

0:34:30	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't make it any more fancy because you can find it better.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_00
 It makes it more fancy because other remotes don't have it.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_03
 We're talking about the button or the microphone.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_03
 The microphone is a very small thing which you can make it look like it's big.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_03
 It's really an important function of the remote.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_05
 I think the left's other corner should be the best.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_05
 It isn't the most inside.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_02
 I think.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_02
 Put it there.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_02
 I don't mind.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't really matter.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_02
 So?

0:35:21	SPEAKER_00
 Anymore?

0:35:22	SPEAKER_03
 So, well, type supplements.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_02
 Interface type?

0:35:27	SPEAKER_03
 We already discussed this.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_02
 The LCD.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_05
 I think you said like scroll next to the remote.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_05
 Isn't that handy?

0:35:37	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's better to just type what you'd like to do on the screen if you want to go back.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_05
 If you want to choose audio settings, you press audio settings and it goes to that submenu.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_02
 That's my name, too.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_02
 That's my name, too.

0:35:50	None
 Yeah.

0:35:51	SPEAKER_00
 The young people do like the scroll.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_02
 I think so, too.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_02
 So, why not?

0:36:01	SPEAKER_02
 On side.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_00
 Or at least, yeah, I don't know if you need a scroll.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_00
 But the menu won't taste as though they're like most.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_00
 And I think you can navigate through a menu.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think you need to be the scroller.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think you need a settings faster.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_05
 I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_05
 But if you don't have a lot of options, then you have a lot of options.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_02
 Because when you use the settings menu, for example, to look up some channels on your television, you should scroll down on a menu, which probably does not fit on your screen.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay, true.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_02
 So, then it's very handy to scroll down.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_02
 You make just a rubber just like on your mouse or just put it on the side and it's very easy to use.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, no problem.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_03
 And I think it would make it even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side which you can touch.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_00
 It's also different.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_03
 There's our five minutes warning.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_03
 Any more questions about the design?

0:37:02	SPEAKER_03
 Or do you use the interface?

0:37:04	SPEAKER_03
 Different components?

0:37:05	SPEAKER_04
 Color short, clear, shape, clear, materials, clear.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, what's the standard color?

0:37:11	SPEAKER_02
 It works for a lot.

0:37:12	SPEAKER_02
 Very standard.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_02
 No, we have different color.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_02
 How many colors?

0:37:15	SPEAKER_02
 You have different colors, but you should have a standard color.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_02
 I think black.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_02
 Black.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_02
 Black, I think, is the standard.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_05
 With a yellow, darker, something like this color or something.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_02
 Just a regular, a large color.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:27	SPEAKER_02
 And then have different colors to use.

0:37:29	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's better to have silver nowadays.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_05
 Silver, yeah.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's more silver.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_02
 Silver.

0:37:34	SPEAKER_05
 Silver.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_03
 Black.

0:37:36	SPEAKER_03
 Silver.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_03
 Black.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_05
 Silver.

0:37:39	SPEAKER_05
 Black.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_05
 Silver.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_05
 Black.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_02
 Black.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_02
 Black.

0:37:53	SPEAKER_02
 But if you use silver, silver rubber isn't fancy.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_02
 True.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_02
 When you use titanium, silver is fancy, but when you use silver rubber, this is fancy.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_02
 Silver has to shine, and rubber doesn't shine.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_02
 Especially when you just made a soft rubber like this.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_02
 You understand?

0:38:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I would think about colors like red, yellow, blue...

0:38:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, of course.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_05
 The fruity colors.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_05
 and other colors like red and brown, dark red and brown.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_00
 Do I have to have a normal black one?

0:38:33	SPEAKER_00
 Who should be?

0:38:35	SPEAKER_03
 You think?

0:38:37	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so that wraps it up.

0:38:40	SPEAKER_03
 Everybody knows what to do.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_03
 Well, what to do?

0:38:43	SPEAKER_01
 I wrote it down here.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_01
 What to do?

0:38:45	SPEAKER_03
 The next meeting is once again in 30 minutes.

0:38:48	SPEAKER_03
 Here are the individual actions and especially notice that the individual interfaces are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board and of course to all four of us specific instructions will be emailed by a personal coach.

0:39:07	SPEAKER_00
 Do we have to stay here or do we?

0:39:10	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I'd say just wait for an email and find out.

0:39:14	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:39:15	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:39:16	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that was what I had to say.

0:39:19	SPEAKER_03
 Final thoughts from anyone?

0:39:21	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:39:22	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, thank you very much.

0:39:24	SPEAKER_05
 Finished.

0:39:25	SPEAKER_05
 Thank you very much.

0:39:26	SPEAKER_00
 I'm talking English now.

0:39:29	None
 I'll make a new one for you.

0:39:37	None
 Thanks.

0:39:38	None
 And I'll face out.

0:39:40	None
 Bye.

0:39:41	None
 Okay, well, I'll try to put minutes in the project folder as soon as possible.

0:39:47	None
 Okay.

0:39:48	None
 Hopefully.

0:39:49	None
 Far side is done.

0:39:51	None
 Okay.

0:39:52	None
 Good luck.

0:39:53	None
 I'll start.

0:39:54	None
 Look.

0:39:55	None
 It's not a year.

0:39:57	None
 I've got that.

0:39:58	None
 Yeah.

0:39:59	SPEAKER_02
 It's a smart board.

0:40:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:40:01	SPEAKER_02
 Um...

0:40:02	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:40:15	None
