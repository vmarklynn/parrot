0:00:00	None
 Oh I told you...

0:00:25	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I told me the X-I moved it.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_02
 I just put it over here.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_02
 You know, do I have to wait for this?

0:00:42	SPEAKER_01
 How's that?

0:00:43	SPEAKER_01
 Cool.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, right.

0:00:45	SPEAKER_01
 It is PowerPoint time.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_01
 I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before before this experiment.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:00:57	None
 I'm just kind of fun.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_01
 So here we have our detailed design meeting where we will look at the prototype.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_01
 So I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my, that my coach was sending to me.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_01
 It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, really?

0:01:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_01
 I think.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_01
 Otherwise, it's just saying, I'm the secretary and I'm there for I'm taking the minutes.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_01
 So just to go, just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting, I will open them slowly.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_01
 Wait for it.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_01
 Wait for it.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's not you.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_01
 No, that's not you.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_01
 This is this is a very high powered stuff here.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_01
 That will click here.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_01
 There we go.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_01
 So basically the moral of the story from our last meeting was that we, that we had meetings from, we had presentations done by the industrial designer, well, from Nathan and Ron and Sarah about what we can do here and what sort of limitations we're operating with.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry, limitations were operating under what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_01
 And we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with our voice recognition.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_01
 I've had a vaguely non-remote like shape because you didn't really use it as a remote, as you could just use your voice.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_01
 That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation, but with a slider fulled out Bay for more advanced functions for users.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_01
 And the, the, the idea and the idea were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype press to look at.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_01
 So that sorted back to the main.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_01
 Meet here.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_01
 Go ahead and take it away guys.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we have assembled our prototype.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_03
 What's to be said about it.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_03
 We took into account a lot of things that we went over in the last meeting.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_03
 Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen, which you can see.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_03
 And opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_03
 This is going to be the on and off button.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_03
 And we have these buttons to go through the channels.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_03
 And then two volume buttons down here. We decided those were the most important buttons.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_03
 And then for the more advanced functions, there's a slide out panel here.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_03
 You can see that there are lots of things going on.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_03
 But this actually can slide back in.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_03
 It's very nice aesthetic when it's all put away.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_03
 As far as the whole visible light thing, we decided to go with multiple colors.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_03
 Why not?

0:04:24	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, if that's annoying for some people, that function can be turned off.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_04
 Now, it's important that we talk to quite a bit about the interchangeable faces.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_04
 And what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_04
 And we call it fruity.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_04
 A appropriate.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_04
 Of course, that's interchangeable.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_04
 I think it would be desirable for the regular product in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_04
 But this is kind of something that can be done.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_04
 And as you can see on the television there, we have the voice detector device on the top.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_04
 So that will work quite well with regard to finding this contraption.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_04
 What other things we see here?

0:05:21	SPEAKER_04
 Well, if you give it a touch, it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_04
 So I think that will work well with regards to our market.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_04
 And let's see.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_04
 Clearly, there's going to be some more colors and whatnot available.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_04
 Do you have anything else to add to that?

0:05:45	SPEAKER_03
 I've worried about the materials.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_03
 The entire thing is covered in rubber coating.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_03
 So it's very durable.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_03
 It's not going to break like some type of plastic that's dropped.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_03
 And of course, as you can see, if you touch it, it does have that nice squishy feel.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_04
 It's actually important to note that the television, if there's an earthquake or anything like that, it actually is edible inside.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if you noticed, but I wrote the company's name.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, well done.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_03
 This is actually an apple inside.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_02
 Do we need to worry about broad factors?

0:06:30	SPEAKER_04
 It's encased and then you type them.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, this is presented as a problem.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_03
 We got to go ahead of ourselves.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_03
 I know we're not talking about making televisions.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_03
 Edible televisions.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_04
 So wave of the future.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_04
 It's a couple of years off at least.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_04
 Impossible new product.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_04
 But I think that sums up the main features of the remote.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know if you guys have any questions or whether we need to worry about any other marketing areas or anything of that.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_04
 Nature, did we come in under budget?

0:07:04	SPEAKER_03
 We did.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, this costs, well, to put this into production, looking at about, was our goal was 1250 euro.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_03
 And this actually came at 1199.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_03
 So I was quite pleased with that.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_03
 One thing that we didn't do, obviously we had a choice with the buttons, whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_03
 But we just went for a classic rubber button.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_03
 And since we did that, we didn't have to use as many microchips, which is quite nice.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_03
 That's what helped keep the cost down.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_03
 Really?

0:07:40	SPEAKER_03
 Even though it has a lot of modern technology, for example, the voice recognition.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_03
 In a lot of ways, it's just a simple remote.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_03
 I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers, we might be able to get it even cheaper.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_04
 Did we talk about the voice recognition option?

0:08:03	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, no, we haven't talked about that.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_04
 So on the back here, you'll notice this area here, which is actually the voice recognition console.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_04
 And I think it's nicely designed into the overall look.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_04
 But basically, the voice recognition incorporates the latest designs that our research team has come up with.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_04
 Basically, quite similar to the coffee maker design that we were talking about earlier.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_04
 And I think that has given a proven ease of use and whatnot.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_04
 And allows features like the remote to actually talking back to the user.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_03
 Cool.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_01
 Any questions?

0:08:55	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, let's do.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_02
 Do we have other, for lack of a word, skins, covers, and play now?

0:09:01	SPEAKER_02
 Are those going to be developed later?

0:09:03	SPEAKER_02
 Once we see how the couple we have go?

0:09:06	SPEAKER_02
 Or do we need to understand what I am?

0:09:08	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we didn't quite have enough material.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I was expecting a prototype.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_00
 I just don't know if you guys had any in mind.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_03
 Well, as you can see, this is just a most superficial layer.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_03
 And it'd be very easy to put another layer.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_03
 Something else.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_02
 Something else.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_04
 Actually, this bottom red ring here just unclips.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_04
 And then you put a new plate on top of that.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_04
 So, I mean, we definitely priced out even spongier, non-natural look materials, which I think worked out fine.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_04
 We also continued on with the ideas that following apples, color schemes, with the light orange and shine, it's not quite a face plate.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_03
 It's more like a pseudo face plate.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_03
 Because it's simple enough that in the factory, we could very easily put a different one on it.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_03
 It locks into place such that it's pretty permanent.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_03
 At the same time, if we want to go the other way, it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_03
 And we could go the face plate way.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_03
 If you know what I mean.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yep. It's still an option.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_02
 Very cool.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_02
 Nice job.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. Thanks, guys.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_01
 That's very, very good work.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_01
 I like it.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_01
 Brilliant.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_01
 What we need to discuss now is the finance of it.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_01
 I got me, you've provided a number that actually sounds quite nice.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_01
 The trouble is I was just given this by finance.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_01
 It's a spreadsheet of the parts.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_01
 And I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just going to clear this out real quickly.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_01
 But it looks like.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_01
 So we'll just, if we can just itemize what's in here, we've got this, it's a solar cell thing, right?

0:11:06	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_03
 With the backup battery.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_03
 It's in that.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_01
 With the back.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_04
 And the worst recognition area actually doubles as the solar cell area.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_01
 Claver.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_01
 Claver.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_01
 Well then.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_01
 So I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a, it's a speaker in a sensor at the same time, isn't it?

0:11:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_03
 It's just making use of the same space and the same particular space.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_01
 In the case, it's more of a single curved case.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_01
 I guess it would be that would be the general.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_03
 I guess you could say.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_01
 And we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout push button interface with this other drop-downs.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_01
 And maybe we've got two push button interfaces.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_01
 And special.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_01
 I guess it's a, we've got a sort of a wood material, a rubbery type material.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_03
 I guess you'd have to mark special color and special form as well.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_03
 And she, because it is very unconventional.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_01
 It's quite unique.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_01
 I like it.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_01
 So it looks like.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_02
 It's 16.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_01
 A bit over budget.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_01
 Just a little bit.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 So what we could do perhaps.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_01
 A simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 Or take out the backup battery.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I think that if we were talking about it being one of her main selling features, being environmental on the way up the batteries and whatnot, although it does still have a battery, so I'm not sure that what the cell is on that.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, we could take the battery out of it, you see.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_03
 And it probably worked 99% of the time.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_03
 But you're going to have to set up a call center for that 1% of the time when people are calling.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_03
 So like, my remote isn't working.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_03
 What am I going to do?

0:13:07	SPEAKER_03
 People will be upset.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_03
 I think in a long run, it's better to keep the battery.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_03
 And it's hard to scrap the whole solar battery idea because that's so integral to the theme that we have.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_00
 Hmm.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it's difficult. We have all these things integral to the, um, two to the design of it that we just can't back out of now.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_01
 It would have to be.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_01
 Seems like we'd have to go back to square one.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_01
 In a way, um, if we were going to try to undo one bit, we probably have to undo most of it.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_02
 Although we don't want to get rid of the whole environmental, I mean, obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marking this is like a natural new thing.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_02
 But honestly, if we cut that one piece out, we're actually coming in on the budget.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_02
 In fact, I'm a math correctly.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_04
 You might be able to sway me on the idea that our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_02
 That's what sets us apart, right? Yeah, that's what setting us into this young market.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_02
 That's what we started from.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_02
 So, I don't know what I mean, you know, perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price, we can bring that back into the game.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_02
 But it looks like at this point that may be out of our league.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_04
 The reality is, you know, for me, from an ideological standpoint, I'd like to stick with the solar cell, but I kind of have to throw myself in the business structure and model here.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_04
 It's either or.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_04
 I think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project without the solar cell.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. I think that's, fortunately, that's our best option.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_03
 We're going to get below gold.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_03
 1250.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_01
 Because we can't remove the push buttons because they are.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_01
 We can't get rid of the, I mean, removing the changing the case wouldn't be so much of a...

0:15:22	SPEAKER_01
...suit.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_01
...nor would changing the case materials.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_01
 So yeah, that looks like to be the only thing. So that would be, it's a major change, but...

0:15:37	None
 Yeah.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. All right.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_01
 So we're in agreement on that.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_02
 Unfortunately, I think we are.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_04
 I think that was a good compromise you brought for it, too.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_01
 Moving along swiftly.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_01
 So I guess now we just go to the project evaluation, which I will allow.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_02
 That will be me.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_02
...cord?

0:16:13	SPEAKER_01
 Of course, sorry.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_02
 No problem.

0:16:15	None
 You reach.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_02
 It will be great. Thank you.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 That would be great.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't even do that on purpose either.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. Basically, I was just evaluating from what we know of our products working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of...

0:16:34	SPEAKER_02
...these are the things we needed to do, these are the things that look like we feel are important.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_02
 So I was looking at basic design things.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_02
 Does it fulfill its function, does it remote, is the design, what we wanted to do, our technologies up to where we'd hope they would be, and does it fulfill the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for?

0:16:53	SPEAKER_02
 Basic questions like, you know, does it turn on, does it respond to voice recognition?

0:16:59	SPEAKER_02
 And overall, in general, it looks like it's coming up to par.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_02
 The only thing is with the pull-out panel, that is going to take some adjusting because of the new sort of interface, that looked like it was coming up rough, but then once you get used to it, it does make a lot of sense.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_02
 So I think overall, we're heading the right direction.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, okay.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_04
 So...

0:17:21	SPEAKER_02
 Like that spongy feel.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. It looks like it's going over well.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_02
 The page function works well. That's good to hear.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_02
 We're good, yeah.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_02
 We're good, yeah.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_02
 I think eventually, if we do branch out with this program, maybe when we do have higher budget options, and if it goes over with this model, we can look into wider range voice recognition.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_02
 Like from other rooms of the house and stuff, but for now, what we've got is working in the range we need it for.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_02
 So it's all good.

0:17:45	None
 Really?

0:17:46	SPEAKER_03
 That's everything for me.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_02
 That's everything for me.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_03
 But losing the solar panel.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_02
 It's okay.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_02
 It is a setback, but...

0:17:54	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, do you need the quad back?

0:17:57	SPEAKER_04
 We might have lost that granola market again.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, they don't want to tell you, is there any way to do that?

0:18:04	SPEAKER_01
 I guess that's true.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_01
 So this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_01
 I got this slide from the coach, and I'm not sure what it's connected to.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_01
 So I guess we are going to discuss project process.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_01
 And that is going to go into my report.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_01
 So I guess this is the point where we go out of roll that looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_01
 How that all worked, I guess.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_02
 As in within the team.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_02
 I think so, yeah.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_03
 So it's just kind of...

0:18:51	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's a mic kind of thing.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_02
 It is now.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_01
 You're charged.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_01
 So there you go.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not screwing up and experiencing it.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_01
 But I trusted she would jump in if I was.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_01
 So okay.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_01
 Whatever.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_01
 So any thoughts?

0:19:12	SPEAKER_03
 We can start at these points here.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_02
 I think they're starting box, yeah.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_01
 What did you guys feel about the process?

0:19:21	SPEAKER_02
 I think in general, for a day's worth of work, we actually were relatively productive considering the little amount of input we had going in.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_02
 And the technology has definitely been a help.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_02
 It's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_04
 We didn't use the whiteboard at all.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_04
 No, no whiteboard.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_02
 We could now, if that had made up for it, really.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_02
 And I feel like if you guys have been designing in here, perhaps that would have changed, but because of the constraints, it doesn't really matter.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_04
 Also, had I not been intrigued about the pen.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think I would have used it at all.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_04
 I didn't write barely anything.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think I was taking notes more often than usually just coming to the pen.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_02
 That's true.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_01
 It was pretty cool tack, though.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_02
 I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, is you writing a personal coach?

0:20:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I didn't get a sense of it.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_03
 What if you get a response two or three months from now?

0:20:27	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think we can.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_01
 It attempts to contact the coach.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_02
 Well, what kind of coaching is that really?

0:20:34	SPEAKER_02
 What if I really needed something?

0:20:37	SPEAKER_04
 I think there was a lot of room for creativity.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_04
 We could do whatever we basically wanted until the budget came down on us.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_02
 And even then, we did get a decent product turned out, although it's not everything we wanted it to be.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, with the natural look.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_02
 Organic, really.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 They had a peeler in here.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_02
 And highly resourceful teammates might I add, which is always a plus.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I thought it was really creative.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I'm impressed.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_03
 The teamwork was good.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_03
 The proof that we were always full.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_02
 We didn't waste a single bit of play to waste every day.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_02
 Nice.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_02
 All four of those little containers.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_03
 I guess the multicolored wave pattern.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_03
 My one criticism was that we didn't have enough colors to work with.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_02
 You could have developed multiple skins, really.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_02
 I know.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_02
 More colors.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_02
 Amazing.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, wow.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_01
 What did you guys think about the roles?

0:21:48	SPEAKER_02
 They were good.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_03
 What kind of fun.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_03
 It was.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_03
 I think it was pretty clever because we were never able to get too far off track.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_03
 I think it was because the information came in at the right time.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_03
 True.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_03
 Kind of filled in the gaps enough.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_03
 The same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_03
 Do you know, just kind of that.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_02
 Do I just feel like the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day?

0:22:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, maybe it's just me, but I didn't actually get any information.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_02
 That's presentation at all.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_02
 That's true.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_00
 I got this.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't even get email.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_02
 Like, that was it.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah, I feel like that was slightly lacking, but then, you know, fill in the blanks on your own level of creativity up.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I think that was, I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_04
 What to do.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_04
 Well, no, but also, yeah, when I was reporting about what each of us was doing as often confused as to what you were doing.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_04
 It was a bit much.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_04
 And then I also felt like, you know, a lot of our discussion would center around specifically what my task was because that was kind of the interface question.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_04
 Which is what the whole project was about.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_04
 Very much so.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_04
 But, and then in the end, I think our job's kind of melted together.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_03
 That was fun.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's fun.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_03
 The most helpful thing out of everything was getting the PowerPoint slides already put together.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_02
 We didn't have that.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_03
 There's no way we could have got all that done in time.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_02
 Very much so.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_01
 Cool.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_04
 I think your leadership was quite good.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 It was.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_01
 She said, she actually made a comment off on the board.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_01
 You're getting into this.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_01
 And I really, it's true.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_01
 I did get, I felt like I got way too into it.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_02
 That's kind of a good thing though.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_01
 I feel like I slept in a lot.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_02
 You know, the rest of us in the structure work with.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_04
 So, hey.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_04
 So, is that the first time you're taking on that kind of rule?

0:23:40	SPEAKER_01
 The first time you've ever done anything like, yeah, project management.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_01
 I use the organized crap.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_01
 It's one thing to do, you know, set up a party with your friends.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_01
 You know, little second.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_01
 I think you guys felt that you could keep the, yeah, suspension of disbelief kind of like, like the role.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_02
 Except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand and I knew we were all flying through our teeth.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_04
 I had to admit, as soon as we started, I mean, as soon as we got the play-doh.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_04
 I can only imagine.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_04
 You know, the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it, it like us, you know.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_01
 Absolutely.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_01
 Like us to like, like, an Erimo control or a spaceship, which is a spaceship like us.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_01
 Do you guys ever used to build a spaceship like us?

0:24:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_00
 Still have been in those.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 Totally.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_01
 Best spaceships ever.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_01
 You guys felt like there's enough teamwork in all.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_02
 Thanks, though.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_01
 No, I don't know.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_01
 I was just.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_02
 No, we didn't actually, I mean, other than minor discussion meetings, there wasn't, except for the actual building.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_02
 But I feel like if this was a team project, there actually would have been much more of the collaborative, like brainstorming, use the board.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_02
 Well, and this would have been six months worth of work, not like three hours worth of meetings.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I think had the issue being more serious, it would probably would have brainstormed more during our meetings.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_04
 That's true.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_01
 Of course, I'm unconscious of the idea of the project manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_01
 That's that kind of like, like, yeah, that is kind of interesting.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_01
 It's kind of fascinating with it.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, the whole process is.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_03
 I wonder why, is there anything about the way that we got so much commitment?

0:25:31	SPEAKER_03
 What was the kept us from going to the board?

0:25:34	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if there was a right.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_02
 Mine was the mics.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_02
 I was afraid of the brakes.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_03
 The mics are loose and at each time you get up, it's a possibility of tripping over something like, contangle there.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I don't know what I would have shown on that board.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_02
 True.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_02
 But it didn't even occur to me as an option.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, I don't know that I would have, but I know that I consciously didn't.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, it's just like the paper.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know what I really need the paper for.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_04
 True.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_04
 Because I've got this laptop.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:26:04	None
 Send it.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_04
 I just use it because it's literally right in front of me.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_01
 I want to see the output files from the digital paper.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_01
 I know.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_01
 My handwriting looks like digitized because my handwriting is crap.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, see what it looks like in PDF format or something.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_03
 Usually I would do a lot more to it, like too, but I didn't.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_03
 I know.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_02
 I felt like I needed to be professional, so I didn't like to roll my paper and stuff.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, well, not entirely.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_02
 But still, I do have less than I usually do.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_01
 I'm curious about what the debriefing is going to be like.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_01
 You know, like what is the, well, exactly we're looking for here.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_04
 So is this all I need to go through?

0:26:47	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure what the new idea is found.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_01
 It is about ideas.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_02
 Did it just say in the email that we needed to discuss that?

0:26:55	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's the thing I got in the email.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_01
 I got this PowerPoint file, but this slide was.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_01
 That slide was like that.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't change this one at all.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_01
 Wow.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_01
 I guess one the right track.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_04
 Any new ideas with regard to environmental concepts?

0:27:15	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_02
 I kind of like.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_02
 I think they still do their job.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you're fine, actually.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_02
 I am thinking outside the little square box, though, but literally in like form.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, maybe a circle would be all right.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, different.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_01
 This is going to make you wonder.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, how much can you do with remote control?

0:27:33	SPEAKER_01
 It's like inventing a new car.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, you got to be technically car shaped and won't fit on the road.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_02
 Don't know.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_01
 Hmm.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_01
 I know.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going back into it.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_01
 I think this is.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, how long was I being supposed to be?

0:27:52	SPEAKER_02
 How much time?

0:27:53	SPEAKER_01
 40ish.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_01
 I wish it go on a bit.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, about the project you've out.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know, but you guys, but I felt like a bit.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_01
 Understimulated on the whole thing.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_01
 Like what?

0:28:07	SPEAKER_01
 Like, you know, what am I really doing?

0:28:09	SPEAKER_01
 You know, what is.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_02
 At the beginning, it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_02
 Taking out of work.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_02
 And I was like, had like all these brainstorming I was doing and then suddenly I was like, well, it's just another two-minute presentation that you guys don't really care about.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_02
 I knew I said, well, hey.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_02
 I think it was the real.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_02
 You know what I mean?

0:28:28	SPEAKER_02
 Like, we also knew when we were headed with it so it didn't feel.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_02
 Definitely wouldn't.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_02
 Like, it mattered.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_03
 I just filled out the question I was marking and probably higher in terms of how much I had to, how much I stressed over it.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_03
 And by the time I got to the last one, I was like, what I would.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_04
 I think there's also realization of basically just copying face.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_04
 What's given to you?

0:28:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_04
 Which wasn't so clear to me at the beginning.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_01
 I actually didn't do that at all though.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_01
 Every single one of the presentations, I either added slides or added them.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I added like five slides.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_02
 I only got like ones.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_03
 I just got blank ones.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_02
 What, really?

0:29:04	SPEAKER_02
 My slides were all like they'd have a title maybe.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, my name.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_01
 And they were just empty.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_01
 They didn't have, they didn't like, mine, yeah, they didn't come like this.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_01
 Like, this was what it looks like.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_01
 Like with those boarddardi on it.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_01
 Literally, just like that.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_01
 And.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_01
 And.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_02
 And why yours always looked so more complicated.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't need it slides.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_02
 I think I added a slide one time.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_04
 I added many slides every time.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_04
 Hey, what the whole new background.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_02
 That was what they call.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_03
 That was class.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_03
 High moment.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_03
 I'll explain.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_03
 You can see.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, the thoughts come to mind.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_02
 I want to know how our products were there.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_03
 I think you would fail.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_02
 I think you would take a special look like that.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_02
 An apple would have read it by now.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_02
 He even has a physical.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_02
 But you know the whole.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_04
 Even you.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_03
 We kind of designed it to look a little bit like face.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_04
 Here, but it's happy face.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_04
 Actually, that looked a lot more like a ton.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_04
 It's previous to build other design modifications.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_04
 I hope you appreciate the incorporation of some tinfoil from a random pick up bar that we consumed by accident.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_01
 Interesting.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_02
 I'm interesting day.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_04
 I say so.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_04
 So again, I reiterate my question of how different we are compared to the other groups, especially between culture groups.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_01
 It seems like everything flowed pretty logically, you know, from the basics to the concept.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_01
 Although the whole concept thing, the whole concept's face.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think I really understood like the concept.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the idea.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_01
 Conocional item.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I mean, it's like I have a concept of a mug's material.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_01
 It's just maybe that's what it is.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_01
 You know, maybe rather than concepts, it should be thought of.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_01
 I thought of it.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_01
 I thought of it right other than in terms of concepts.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_01
 I thought of it in terms of like proposed idea.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_01
 And then the final would be back to the actual specified prototype or whatever.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_01
 But.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_01
 Bono is kind of interesting.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_01
 So we have more slides.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_01
 No, just this closing one.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, the established at the cost weren't really within budget, but we could.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_02
 We got it to be.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_01
 We did the project evaluation based on.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_01
 Sarah's evaluation of.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_02
 There was really technically an evaluation of the products, not the project in general.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_02
 Which I'm not sure is the same thing at the time that just made more sense.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_02
 But I could see if they were really asking about us.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_01
 Because we did we had a fight think about it.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_01
 And it's all recorded.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_01
 And what I'm going to put.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_01
 I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_01
 So I'll put all that into the final report as well.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_01
 Or as much as seems like maybe not like that.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_01
 Articles and stuff like because.

0:32:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_01
 And so forth.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_01
 But up with my students.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe so hopefully we get a copy of the recording.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_02
 I've had done.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_02
 I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_02
 Just in the middle of the sentences like that that mean nothing.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_01
 There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_01
 Second, the sixth.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_01
 What the.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_01
 Is guy sitting here.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, he's studying.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_01
 Fill it works or something.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, they're called the disfluencies.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_03
 Disfluencies.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_02
 That's a good word for it.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we like our fancy phrases.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_01
 And just add some prefixes.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_02
 Sounds classier.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_01
 I will save this into the.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_03
 I find myself hitting the send and receive button.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_03
 You know what?

0:33:23	SPEAKER_03
 I can.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_02
 I can.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I didn't.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_01
 Come on, give me some information.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_01
 Well, to be fair, we're hooked.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_01
 We're all hooked on the internet.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_04
 So I mean, I do.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_04
 We are addicts.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_04
 That's scary.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_04
 I'll just throw on that.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_01
 I know, imagine we went the first 10, 15 years of our lives without the internet.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_01
 It's only the last 10 that were like, what was the internet?

0:33:46	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it's just in the past five.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_01
 We've gone from 28 eight modems to broadband all the time.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_04
 Do you know, I think we've had internet for like 18 years.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_01
 No, we have, but not in the sense it's so on.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_02
 You know, my grandparents had an 80s and I got it in 94.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_02
 But still.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_02
 It's crazy.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_03
 So in the 80s.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_02
 My grandfather does computer science back in the States.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_02
 And so they had an EDU and Gov network.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_02
 There's basically the fundamental structures.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_02
 But it wasn't a household house sold yet.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_02
 Because it hadn't been.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it was to the like seven universities or something.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that was him.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_04
 You guys ready to celebrate?

0:34:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's how I said that.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's how I said that includes like,

0:34:34	SPEAKER_00
 something exciting.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_01
 Should probably call that meeting to an end. I think that's closer.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_03
 It's been 40 minutes or so.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_03
 Because it's been long enough.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_04
 Celebrate.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_04
 Where you find that?

0:34:48	SPEAKER_02
 I have no idea.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_03
 It's at the only song you have.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_03
 There's another one.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_01
 It's just where those media players.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_01
 Huh?

0:34:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, awesome.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_01
 The default track.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_01
 I thought it was David Burns looking to the eyeball.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_01
 That's when it seems to be shipping with it.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_01
 I don't really ship it for a while.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe this is a new version.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_02
 So is that a close?

0:35:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I guess we'll call it an end of the meeting.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, the end of the meeting.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_01
 Fab.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you, gentlemen.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.
