0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, good after this again.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_01
 So we should have our final meeting about the detailed design of the product, although not control.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_01
 So there is the agenda for today.

0:00:45	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_01
 Then we have a presentation of prototype Vue2.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_01
 Sounds interesting.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_01
 And I will have a presentation of evaluation criteria by our marketing experts.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_01
 Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the cost of the thing.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_01
 And hopefully we should fit the target of 12.5 euro.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so let's go.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_01
 If I go quickly to the minutes of the last meeting.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_01
 So we went through, we took these following decisions.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_01
 No LCD, no speech recognition technology.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_01
 We went through a bad analog in field for the remote control.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_01
 We went through the use of wheels and buttons.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_01
 And also the use of a basic station for battery charging and also to code the remote control when it is lost.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, good.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_01
 So guys, let's present this wonderful thing.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so we can go to the slides.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah, sorry.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_01
 Number two, sorry.

0:02:19	None
 Which is?

0:02:21	SPEAKER_03
 The final design, final design.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so, Michael, you can go ahead.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so following our decision to make a yellow, well, to make a banana.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, can you show it to the camera maybe?

0:02:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_00
 We actually have a...

0:02:45	SPEAKER_03
 You can pull it out first.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_00
 Well, first of all, we made an attractive base station with a banana leaf.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_00
 Look and feel.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_00
 And banana sits in there, you know, nicely weighted so that it's not going to tip over.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_00
 And this is the remote itself.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_00
 It's kind of...

0:03:06	SPEAKER_00
 It's ergonomic if it's in the hand rather well.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_00
 We've got the two scroll wheels here, which, you know, one on the left for the volume and the one on the right for the channel.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_00
 And underneath we have the turbo button, which is in like a nice trigger position for pressing quite naturally.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_01
 Why is the use of the turbo button already?

0:03:33	SPEAKER_00
 This is when you're scrolling through the channels, you can tell it to skip the past channels that you quickly rather...

0:03:42	SPEAKER_01
 When you stop, it stops.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, well, when you stop scrolling the wheel, it stops.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_00
 But normally with...

0:03:48	SPEAKER_00
 It will just stay on each station briefly so you can see it.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_03
 And we do have one more functionality.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_03
 If you take the banana as such and you press the turbo button, so it's switch on the TV.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_03
 The turbo button.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_00
 So, rather than having an extra button for the on-off switch, we just use the turbo button.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_00
 Where is this button for?

0:04:11	SPEAKER_00
 This is the teletext button.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_00
 So once you press that, then you get teletext and you can use the channel selector scroll wheel as...

0:04:18	SPEAKER_00
 Two navigation screws.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_02
 You want to go to page 700?

0:04:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_00
 How many wheels is he?

0:04:26	SPEAKER_00
 Well, then you can...

0:04:27	SPEAKER_00
 You have like a little number selection thing.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_00
 You press the teletext button to move between the field and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have... you scroll to seven and then zero zero and then you can...

0:04:42	SPEAKER_00
 I don't understand.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_02
 Can you repeat this?

0:04:45	SPEAKER_00
 Well, you can press the teletext button.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_03
 Then you can...

0:04:52	SPEAKER_03
 Then both the scroll buttons, they are for teletext browsing.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_03
 And you can tell it...

0:04:56	SPEAKER_02
 Ah, okay, okay.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_03
 Once you press the teletext button, then the scroll buttons, they are more for teletext, they are no more for channel or volume.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_03
 I see, I see.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_00
 And this is the infrared port.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_00
 That's right.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_00
 Also the top of the banana.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_00
 Excellent.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_00
 And then we have in the base station, we have the button at the front for calling the banana.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 And the leaves play through all of the antennas.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_00
 Actually they do.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_00
 It's...

0:05:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_00
 That's form and function in the one...

0:05:30	SPEAKER_03
 So it always means whatever the race goes back, they get reflected and then...

0:05:35	SPEAKER_03
 You are having a better coverage.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_03
 It's like antennas.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:05:40	SPEAKER_00
 But yeah, that's just like...

0:05:43	SPEAKER_00
 That's an attractive base station.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_01
 Great.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:05:48	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:05:49	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:05:50	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:05:51	SPEAKER_03
 What else?

0:05:52	SPEAKER_03
 And for the power source, we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries in this.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_03
 And the base station is going to have the input from the power line for...

0:06:03	SPEAKER_03
 For charging the batteries.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_02
 Is it really white?

0:06:06	SPEAKER_02
 Is it light?

0:06:07	SPEAKER_02
 Or...

0:06:08	SPEAKER_02
 It is very light.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_00
 It's very light.

0:06:11	None
 It's about the weight of a banana.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_00
 You know, to give you the correct look and feel.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_03
 The bridge.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_03
 And we have put these different colors so that people don't mistake them.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_03
 Mistake it as a banana.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_03
 Otherwise it's...

0:06:23	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_02
 A child comes in.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_00
 I understand.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_00
 I think a child would try to eat it anyway.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe we should consider that.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe help them safety aspects.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_03
 Or we didn't think of that yet.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_01
 So for the power source, apparently you want to use both solar cells.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yes.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_01
 I mean...

0:06:46	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_00
 I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary anymore for a recharging base station.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_01
 Where are you going to place them?

0:06:54	SPEAKER_03
 It'll be always the top somewhere there.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_00
 If I was going to place them, I'd put them on the top here since that's like...

0:06:59	SPEAKER_00
 Do you have enough surface?

0:07:01	SPEAKER_00
 But yeah, I don't really think it's necessary to have the solar cells.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because now we have rechargeable batteries.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_01
 So that is...

0:07:08	SPEAKER_01
 What would be the autonomy roughly?

0:07:10	SPEAKER_00
 The what, sorry?

0:07:11	SPEAKER_01
 The autonomy.

0:07:12	None
 Autonomy.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_01
 What do you mean?

0:07:15	SPEAKER_00
 How long did the batteries now?

0:07:18	SPEAKER_01
 How long did it be out of a station?

0:07:22	SPEAKER_00
 A long time.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_03
 Eight to ten hours.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_00
 It should be...

0:07:28	SPEAKER_03
 What?

0:07:29	SPEAKER_03
 So the time it's not being used.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_01
 So it's...

0:07:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_00
 People want to leave it on the couch, so...

0:07:37	SPEAKER_03
 No, eight or ten hours of working.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_03
 If you're just leaving like that, it'll be much longer.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, weeks.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:07:44	None
 Yeah, that's right.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_01
 Next slide.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_03
 And we are having the speakers, regular chip for control.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_03
 Everything was a factor, so that's why we have gone for our regular chip only, not the advanced chip.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_03
 And that's it.

0:08:04	None
 Okay.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_01
 This is look at all the ways.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_01
 Those are very sounds.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_01
 Very good.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_01
 Nothing else to add.

0:08:15	None
 So it's...

0:08:16	SPEAKER_04
 I like all that.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_02
 I like it.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe the thing that convinced me the less is the multifunctional buttons.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_02
 Looks a bit...

0:08:33	SPEAKER_03
 You want to have more functional buttons?

0:08:39	SPEAKER_02
 Looks a bit puzzled.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know how to say it.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_02
 The buttons change their function depending if it's not...

0:08:48	SPEAKER_02
 It's not...

0:08:49	SPEAKER_03
 We want to keep it simple so that this button is for teletext, which is usually also the case that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that, the channel buttons, they become the scrolling buttons.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_02
 And the volume button will become...

0:09:04	SPEAKER_03
 It's up to you means.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_01
 Well, in fact, both will be...

0:09:07	SPEAKER_01
 Could be useful.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_03
 That means...

0:09:09	SPEAKER_03
 Let's say this can move the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_00
 Or can move between positions and the numbers.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_02
 What about people who want to use digits?

0:09:20	SPEAKER_02
 But...

0:09:21	SPEAKER_02
 Real buttons?

0:09:22	SPEAKER_02
 Wow.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_03
 So there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_03
 So we are targeting a segment which is just very trendy kind of thing that they don't care about the buttons anymore.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_02
 And...

0:09:40	SPEAKER_02
 Have you thought about configuration and all this kind of stuff?

0:09:43	SPEAKER_00
 Also, all of it.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_02
 It's all automatic.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_02
 Very good.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_02
 We are living in a wonderful world.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_01
 Banana everywhere.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:09:57	SPEAKER_02
 It's automatically comfortable.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_02
 It's...

0:09:59	SPEAKER_01
 So we have to go through now variations.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:10:07	SPEAKER_01
 Your slice already.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, you're four.

0:10:09	None
 I...

0:10:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_01
 So this is one...

0:10:12	SPEAKER_01
 Which one is this one?

0:10:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:15	None
 Okay.

0:10:17	None
 I...

0:10:18	SPEAKER_02
 I constructed a list of criteria based on the general user's requirements.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_02
 And its criteria is...

0:10:35	SPEAKER_02
 Will be evaluated.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_02
 It's logical criteria.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_02
 So we must... users must say if it's true or if it's false in a scale ranging from 0 to 7.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_03
 Why does strange vector of 7?

0:10:56	SPEAKER_02
 Because it...

0:10:57	None
 Actually...

0:10:58	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_02
 Usually I've seen that scale from one.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_02
 It's from 1 to 7.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_02
 It's from 1 to 7.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_02
 So you can even...

0:11:09	SPEAKER_02
 It should be an even...

0:11:10	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_02
...scale.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_02
 And 5 is too short and 9 is too long.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_03
 Fine.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_01
 Go ahead.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_01
 I'm...

0:11:22	SPEAKER_01
 To have enough granularity.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_01
 It's in order to have enough granularity in the evolution.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_02
 The variance is...

0:11:29	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_02
 That's many more.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_02
 Great.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_02
 I'm answering your question.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_02
 I found more useful.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_02
 I think I could write the criteria on the whiteboard.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_02
 And we all four could range.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_02
 Could evaluate the...

0:11:49	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:50	None
 So you can say fancy.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_04
 Handy.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_03
 So you can say fancy.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_02
 Handy.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_02
 Handy.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_02
 Let's evaluate if it's fancy.

0:12:14	None
 Yeah.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_03
 It's fancy.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_03
 According to me.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_02
 Seven.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_02
 But...

0:12:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:20	None
 Six.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_03
 Seven.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_02
 Seven by me.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_02
 Six.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_02
 I would say seven.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_03
 It's quite fancy.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_03
 So you can add seven plus six plus seven plus...

0:12:30	SPEAKER_01
 No way.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_00
 Five.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_00
 Five.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_00
 Five.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe six.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 It's...

0:12:37	None
 Okay.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_01
 Six point five.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_01
 Handy.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_00
 Again, I'd give it a six.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's probably more handy than my current remote.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_00
 I'd say scroll wells, but maybe it was the point for not having, you know, the extra buttons when you're real, if you do need them for some reason.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_00
 But, you know, you can always use your other remote.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_01
 So seven.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_00
 Seven.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_01
 Seven.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_01
 Six.

0:13:10	None
 Yeah.

0:13:11	None
 Six.

0:13:12	None
 Six.

0:13:13	None
 Four.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_01
 Five.

0:13:15	None
 Fung Channel.

0:13:17	None
 I'll give five.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_03
 Four.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_03
 I would say...

0:13:22	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it depends when you say functional.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_00
 Do you mean it does what we wanted to do or does what?

0:13:31	SPEAKER_00
 It does, you know, every coffee.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_00
 You know.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_00
 Every thing.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_01
 Every thing remote control does you have all the capabilities.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_02
 It's compared to the all...

0:13:42	SPEAKER_00
 That's right.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_03
 Criminal control.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_03
 That's before.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_03
 The standards.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_03
 What is available in the market of the show?

0:13:50	SPEAKER_03
 I have to say four.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, I don't know what are the real specifications of a universal...

0:13:56	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it's not a universal remote.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_02
 I have not a universal...

0:13:59	SPEAKER_04
 But it's for all kind of TVs.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_00
 Well, all TVs, but only TVs, I guess.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_01
 So it's universal, but for TVs.

0:14:09	None
 Yeah.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_01
 So, four.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_01
 Five.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_03
 Five.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_03
 Four.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_03
 Four.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_03
 Four.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_03
 So four point two.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_03
 Just four.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_03
 Four.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_00
 Obviously, there's an outliers.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:14:23	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_01
 Cool.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_01
 Cool device.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_03
 There I'll give it seven.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_02
 It means cool features like new features, actually.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:14:37	None
 Which...

0:14:38	SPEAKER_03
 While a TV, the most important feature which I felt was the locator, which is a cool feature.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_03
 And then scroll buttons are again cool features.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have LCD for it.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_03
 But that we decided we don't want to have.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_02
 Seven.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_02
 I go to type five.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_02
 I'll say five.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_01
 Six.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_01
 Seven.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_01
 Plus six.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_01
 I say, I six seven.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_00
 So it's...

0:15:03	SPEAKER_00
 You hit seven?

0:15:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_00
 Because it's five, five, seven, seven.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_00
 Definitely easy to use.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_00
 Definitely seven.

0:15:11	None
 Seven.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_01
 Seven.

0:15:13	None
 And you?

0:15:14	SPEAKER_01
 Five.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_01
 I'll play here.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_01
 Seven.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_01
 I'll play here.

0:15:20	None
 Seven.

0:15:21	None
 Okay.

0:15:22	None
 I have them.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_00
 Now here's a 60 million dollar question.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_00
 Well, twenty five.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_00
 Twenty five.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_01
 You're right question.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_01
 Of course.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_01
 I would buy the mango butter.

0:15:34	None
 Thank you.

0:15:35	None
 What do you...

0:15:36	SPEAKER_00
 What do you got right?

0:15:38	SPEAKER_00
 Of course.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_02
 Of course.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_02
 The more difficult question for the end.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_03
 I'll say five.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_01
 Twenty five euros.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_02
 I find it quite cheap.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if...

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 It depends if you live in Switzerland or you live in...

0:15:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_01
 So the target price is for all Europe, only for rich countries.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_01
 It's more targeting UK or...

0:16:03	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_02
 The initial specifications were for the whole Europe or...

0:16:08	SPEAKER_01
 So this is selling cost, not production cost.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_02
 This is the initial specifications.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to say six.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 It's quite cheap actually.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_00
 I'd say two.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_00
 One.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_00
 I don't want to banana or make...

0:16:26	SPEAKER_00
 I don't want to banana or make banana or make banana.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's very handy actually if you see.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_03
 It is handy.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's so handy.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_00
 It's handy but it's terrible.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_03
 Anybody who comes to your home, he'll at least ask once, what is this?

0:16:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but it's not a positive thing.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_03
 It's a very positive thing.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_00
 Well, it's handy.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_01
 It's ergonomic but it's a banana.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_01
 Don't forget...

0:16:50	SPEAKER_01
 Ooh, targeting or so.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry, maybe it's...

0:16:54	SPEAKER_00
 I would buy this.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_01
 No, well, yeah.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_01
 I would be...

0:16:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yog.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_01
 Not telling that you are young.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_01
 Like a teenager, for instance.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_00
 No, it's I.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_00
 I would buy.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_01
 You're crazy teenager and you like fun things.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_01
 You want to plant this video girlfriend?

0:17:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you want to show the beautiful banana you have?

0:17:15	SPEAKER_03
 Or maybe it does some other kind of thing.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_00
 Still, I'd say too.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think at any stage in my life I would want to banana or my control.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_00
 Really?

0:17:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, crazy.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_00
 I can say maybe there is a market for it.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_01
 So you say two.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_03
 I say five.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_01
 I say five.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_01
 You say?

0:17:33	SPEAKER_02
 I changed the question.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_02
 So what's your question?

0:17:38	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_02
 I have loads there.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_01
 You have to reload?

0:17:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think so.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so it depends if...

0:17:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's two different situations.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_02
 If you really need a universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for a new one.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, if I had to spend 25 euro, if that was like my limit, maybe I would buy it.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_00
 Because the other 25 euro remote controls are probably going to look worse than a banana.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_03
 And they might not be as easy as they are.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, this is going to, you know, hand it to you.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_02
 So, when I'm...

0:18:27	SPEAKER_02
 I stick to a knife.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_02
 Although it still has six.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_00
 It still has the word of course at the beginning.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_01
 We have six.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_00
 I'll give it a...

0:18:41	SPEAKER_00
 I'll give it a four now.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_02
 So we are...

0:18:44	SPEAKER_01
 Six?

0:18:45	SPEAKER_01
 Six.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_02
 Five.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_02
 Four.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_02
 Six.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_02
 So it's 5.5 more or less.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_01
 So the last question would I change my remote control for a new banana?

0:19:09	SPEAKER_01
 Zero?

0:19:10	SPEAKER_01
 No, we can't.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_01
 So one.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, yeah.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if it's the same thing, I will.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_01
 Let's output two.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_00
 I'd say three.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, my remote control at time is pretty terrible.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_00
 If it was...

0:19:32	SPEAKER_00
 I changed my remote control of my DVD player for a manna banana, then I would be more inclined to.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_00
 For the TV.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_00
 But, because it's really bad.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_00
 But I'd say a three.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_00
 I'll still give it five.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_03
 Five.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_02
 Two, three, five.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I'll go to three.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_02
 You're a romantic, really.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_04
 I would say two.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_01
 And two.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_01
 So it's...

0:19:52	SPEAKER_01
 So it's...

0:19:53	SPEAKER_01
 We had three point five.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, three point five.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_02
 Who is that?

0:19:59	SPEAKER_02
 Liar?

0:20:00	SPEAKER_02
 Who?

0:20:01	SPEAKER_02
 You said five?

0:20:02	SPEAKER_02
 No, I said five.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_01
 You say five.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_01
 Ease is the outlier.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_01
 Just do some.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if...

0:20:11	SPEAKER_02
 It's...

0:20:12	SPEAKER_00
 It's not very promising, but, you know...

0:20:16	SPEAKER_02
 Well, because there are more...

0:20:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_02
 We shouldn't sound like that.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_01
 Well, maybe we should...

0:20:24	SPEAKER_02
 Because the last two questions are much more important than the rest, actually.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_02
 Otherwise, we wouldn't...

0:20:31	SPEAKER_00
 I said some formula you're using that says you have to sound the mouse.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_02
 No, I didn't prepare anything.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_00
 Well, just leave it at that then.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_00
 Oops.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we should stick to a J.R. feeling.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_01
 We can have an out of these numbers, which is that...

0:20:51	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we should go for it.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_02
 Do you want me to sound?

0:20:58	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's not...

0:20:59	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's not...

0:21:00	SPEAKER_00
 You just lose information if you sound it.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_01
 So let's move.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_01
 Let's move on.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, sure.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, sound...

0:21:09	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, you have to estimate the cost.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_01
 So I prepare an exe...

0:21:19	SPEAKER_01
 an exe...

0:21:20	SPEAKER_01
...an exe...

0:21:21	SPEAKER_01
...what we are going to calculate the production cost.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_01
 We should...

0:21:26	SPEAKER_01
 We should be below 12.5.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_01
 So I already put some...

0:21:34	SPEAKER_01
 some numbers here.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_01
 We are going to go through...

0:21:39	SPEAKER_01
 So this is the number of components we need.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_01
 For this thing.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_01
 So it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_01
 And also things that I forget to put like solar cells.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we just started against the solar cells.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yes.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_00
 I knew we stayed out.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_01
 So let's go through all the lines.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_01
 So how did I move?

0:22:05	SPEAKER_01
 This is something we didn't thought about.

0:22:07	None
 But...

0:22:08	SPEAKER_00
 You mean charging it by shaking the banana?

0:22:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_03
 I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_01
 To bring the cost.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_01
 So we stick to battery one.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_01
 No kinetic.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_01
 So why don't I don't see the difference between kinetic and hand-in-o?

0:22:29	SPEAKER_00
 Well, maybe dynamo is like you have to actually...

0:22:32	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, you have to...

0:22:33	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_01
 So kinetic is really shaking the banana.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:22:42	SPEAKER_01
 So it's better, nice falling.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_01
 What's that?

0:22:45	SPEAKER_01
 Let's go ahead.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_01
 So we only have one for battery.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_01
 And then for electronics.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_01
 So I didn't put anything for the month.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_03
 So we have the regular chip on the print.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_03
 Which is one.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_01
 And that's it.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_01
 So we hit...

0:23:03	SPEAKER_03
 And we have sample speaker.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_03
 So one.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_01
 The cost is crazy.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_00
 Well, actually that sample speaker is not...

0:23:14	SPEAKER_00
 We're not using that.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_00
 We're just using the...

0:23:16	SPEAKER_00
 The beep.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_00
 The very beep, simple beep.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_00
 That sample thing is like the voice recording and everything.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_00
 So I remove it.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_00
 I say that...

0:23:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_01
 So don't we need...

0:23:30	SPEAKER_01
 Well, there is no listing for radio-frequency thing.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_03
 So we will put some extras.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_03
 If there is something...

0:23:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, maybe.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_01
 We'll see later.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_01
 So for the case, I put single curved.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_03
 To reduce the cost.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_03
 It's okay.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_00
 Well, wait a second.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_00
 Because what we think...

0:23:52	SPEAKER_00
 It's double curved.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_00
 It's got a...

0:23:54	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, it's...

0:23:55	SPEAKER_00
 It's got walled at the direction.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_00
 So don't worry.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_00
 Well, yeah.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_00
 It's monotonic.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_00
 But...

0:24:00	SPEAKER_00
 It's got walled at the direction.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_03
 It's got...

0:24:04	SPEAKER_00
 But if you hold it...

0:24:06	SPEAKER_00
 If you hold it that way, that's too curved.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_00
 One on the side, one on that side.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_00
 But the opposite side.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, where's this section?

0:24:19	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, this is probably...

0:24:20	SPEAKER_00
 It's a good one here.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_00
 This probably actually costs more than three issues.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_01
 So let's put one here in the back end instead of single lock.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_01
 Right?

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_01
 So we stick to plastic.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_00
 It costs nothing.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_00
 That's right.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_00
 Well, wait a minute.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_01
 No, didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber?

0:24:35	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, if you drop it.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_00
 Too expensive.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_01
 Too expensive.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, we're already at 11.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_00
 We'll come back.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_00
 We'll come back and see if we can fill it in.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_01
 So I'll put a rubber one.

0:24:46	None
 Okay.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_01
 So special core.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_01
 You know?

0:24:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_01
 For the interface, we have...

0:24:54	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have any push buttons.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_03
 No, we have two push buttons.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_03
 We have three.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_03
 No, that is a scroll wheel itself.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_03
 It'll be put in that.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_01
 No, no.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_01
 We have...

0:25:03	SPEAKER_01
 We call and we have three push buttons.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:25:06	None
 Okay.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, when you wrote regular tip, you should put two because there is another tip here.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's always no cheap.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_01
 This is just radio frequency thing.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but cheap.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_03
 There's no chip there.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_03
 It just emits the signal.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_03
 It's just...

0:25:26	SPEAKER_03
 And the receiver accepts it and...

0:25:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_02
 Sure.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_02
 It does nothing?

0:25:30	SPEAKER_03
 Actually.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's a rechargeer thing.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_01
 We didn't think it thought about integrated core wheel push buttons.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I actually did think about it myself, but I thought, you know, because you could potentially, you know, you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a...

0:25:50	SPEAKER_00
 Instead of a turbo.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_00
 But, you know, the turbo button just adds that extra class.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_00
 You know?

0:25:57	SPEAKER_00
 So, I mean, if we're over budget, then maybe we could rethink that.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_00
 So, no LCD.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_01
 So, for... we have no buttons, deployments.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_01
 Right?

0:26:08	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_01
 Uh...

0:26:10	SPEAKER_01
 But in fact, couldn't we consider this button as a buttons supplement because...

0:26:15	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, no.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_01
 These are for colors and special forms, special colors and special materials.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_01
 No, we're not.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_01
 We don't need anything special.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_00
 So, we are over budgeted.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_01
 So, first thing which we should take care of is...

0:26:28	SPEAKER_03
 Make it plastic and forever.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_03
 Let it be plastic.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_00
 And then we're basically on budget except for, you know, in 10 cents.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_00
 And that much money will be required for the base station, which is not there.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_03
 So, maybe, in fact, we have to put two here.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_01
 Because it costs nothing.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:51	None
 Yeah.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, well, yeah, the base station is made out of maybe yours.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_03
 It might be 90 centimetres for the remaining things which the cord and everything is too cool.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_01
 Exactly.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_01
 So, we have an margin for that stuff.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_00
 Does that include charging circuitry and nothing?

0:27:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, maybe.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_01
 Good.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_01
 What?

0:27:16	None
 Excellent.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_00
 So, what do you do with the extra profits?

0:27:22	SPEAKER_01
 We'll invest in R&D.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_00
 Let me extra for it.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_01
 So, well, we're under the cost.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_01
 So, we can go through two project evaluation.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_02
 So, now we have a product which nobody would buy.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_02
 Would...

0:27:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, would buy.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_01
 No, we have a product which none of us would buy.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_01
 The evaluation project.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_01
 Which is different?

0:27:53	SPEAKER_01
 None of us would buy.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_00
 No, it's people in Milan and in Paris.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_00
 I was like, I'm going to buy it.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_00
 Massively, yeah.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_00
 We're not in Milan or Paris.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:03	None
 Okay.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_02
 You have been in Milan a couple of times, so...

0:28:06	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, there were a lot of batteries.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_02
 And you said the lowest.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_02
 The lowest is caution.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_02
 This is what we would...

0:28:14	SPEAKER_01
 You can.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_01
 The tangible battery.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_01
 Because I'm sick of...

0:28:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but that is...

0:28:18	SPEAKER_01
 Extra battery.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_00
 So, project versus.

0:28:26	None
 Wow.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_01
 In fact, I didn't know really what to say here.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_01
 If you have any ideas or what we can say.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_01
 So, I don't understand what they mean by satisfaction on the four example.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_01
 Should it be more like a status of these meetings?

0:28:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_01
 Well, in fact, we use a little bit of the whiteboard and the digital pen.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_01
 Not that much.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_00
 I think we had a fair bit of creativity.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_01
 It's really creative.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_00
 And...

0:29:12	SPEAKER_00
 But I think one thing we missed out of this whole process was a focus group with...

0:29:18	SPEAKER_00
 The actual people were targeting.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_00
 We needed some of these kind of young transettes to come in and play with the banana.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_00
 And, you know, see if they liked it.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_00
 See if I like it.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, maybe we should go through, yeah, in the evaluation.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_00
 Because, yeah, the evaluation for us is kind of pointless.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_01
 So, maybe we should do a kind of evolution in the streets like asking to young people.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_01
 Well, do you like to have a banana as a remote control?

0:29:50	SPEAKER_00
 Because it would also be interesting to find out if we have a market in really young children as well.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_00
 To see, you know, how to market this thing.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_00
 Because, you know, well, I mean, maybe you don't want to give all your kids their own remote because they'll be changing the channel all the time.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_00
 But, you know, maybe in some households where there is, you know, TV for each kid, then, you know, banana remote control could be fun for them as well.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_00
 But, you know, we might have to draw a face on it.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_00
 So, but I think that's something we need to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_01
 Any new ideas we could investigate next time?

0:30:34	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know, oranges?

0:30:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the cost of the thing can be made more than it might be.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_03
 Because I think it's just the optimal what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think there are ways we could maybe simplify the interface.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_00
 Well, just the circuit board that we're using inside, I'm not sure really how complicated our needs are.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, all we have is two push buttons and two scroll wheels.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_00
 Do we really need an integrated circuit to, you know, to process that?

0:31:10	SPEAKER_02
 So, more general remote control instead of just focusing on TV.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_02
 The complexity shouldn't be much higher.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_02
 You said if it goes for DVD, then I...

0:31:25	SPEAKER_00
 And also for, you know, for mood lighting and stuff that would be rather cool.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's actually something that should be in version two, is the ability to control things other than the TV.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_00
 And not just electronic equipment, but, you know, the whole environment of the room.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. Very good.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:31:50	SPEAKER_03
 More dense?

0:31:52	SPEAKER_01
 Well done. I think we can go home.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_01
 Home?

0:31:57	SPEAKER_01
 Happy that is right.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can have the production department to make a real prototype that we can use at home to evaluate.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so thanks very much.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. Bye.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you.

0:32:17	None
 We didn't get the hope of this time that meeting is five minutes.

0:32:28	None
 Yeah.

0:32:29	None
 It was longer than yours.

0:32:37	None
 Okay.

0:32:38	None
 No.

0:32:39	None
 I didn't need that.

0:32:40	None
 Oops.

0:32:41	None
 Okay.

0:32:42	None
 Okay.
