0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, good afternoon again.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_01
 So we should have our final meeting about the detailed design of the product of the remote control.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_01
 So it is there, Jennifer today.

0:00:45	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_01
 Then we have a presentation of prototype V2.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_01
 Sounds interesting.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_01
 And I will have a presentation of a variation criteria by our marketing experts.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_01
 Then we have to go through finance evaluation of the cost of the thing.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_01
 And hopefully we should fit the target of 12.5 euro.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so let's go.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_01
 If I go quickly to the minutes of the last meeting.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_01
 So we went through, we took this following decisions.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_01
 No LCD, no speech recognition technology.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_01
 We went through a bad analog in field for the remote control.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_01
 We went through the use of wheels and buttons.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_01
 And also the use of a base station for battery charging and also to call the remote control when it is lost.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_01
 Good.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_01
 So guys, let's present us this wonderful thing.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so we can go to the slides.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_01
 Oh yeah, sorry.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, no, no, sorry.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_03
 Which is the final design.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so Michael, you can go ahead.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so following our decision to make a yellow, well, to make a banana.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, can you show it to the camera maybe?

0:02:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so we actually have.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_03
 You can pull it out first.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_00
 Well, first, first of all, we made an attractive base station with a banana leaf look and feel.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_00
 And bananas, it's in there, you know, nicely weighted so that it's not going to tip over.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_00
 And this is the remote itself.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_00
 It's kind of, it's ergonomic if it's in the hand, rather well.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_00
 We've got the two scroll wheels here, which, you know, won on the left for the volume and the one on the right for the channel.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_00
 And underneath, we have the turbo button, which is in like a nice trigger position for, you know, for pressing quite naturally.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_01
 Where's the use of the turbo button already?

0:03:33	SPEAKER_00
 This is when you, when you are scrolling through the channels, you can tell it to skip the past channels that you're, yeah, yeah.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_01
 Then you stop when you stop, it stops.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, well, when you stop scrolling the wheel, it stops.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_00
 But normally with it will just stay on its station briefly so you can see.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_03
 And we do have one more functionality.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_03
 If you take the banana as such and you press the turbo button, so it's switch on the, switch on the TV TV here.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_00
 Which one?

0:04:02	SPEAKER_00
 The turbo button.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_00
 So rather than having an extra button for, for the on or switch, we just use the turbo button.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_00
 Where's this button for?

0:04:11	SPEAKER_00
 This is the teletext button.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_00
 So once you press that, then you get teletext and you can use the channel selector scroll wheel as a, to navigate.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_00
 To navigate.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_02
 You want to go to page 700?

0:04:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_01
 Comment wheeled, CZ.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_00
 Well, then you can, you have like a little number selection thing.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_00
 You press the teletext button to move between the field and then you can just scroll the number back and forth.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_00
 So you have, you scroll to seven and then zero, zero.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_02
 And then you can, uh, uh, standing.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_02
 Can you repeat it?

0:04:46	SPEAKER_00
 Well, you can, you can press, press the teletext button.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_03
 Then both the, you can scroll buttons there for teletext closing.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_03
 And you can tell it, okay, okay, once you press that teletext button, then the scroll buttons, they are more for teletext.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_03
 They are no more for channel volume.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_03
 I see.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_00
 And this is the, uh, the infrared port.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_00
 That's right.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_00
 Also the top of the banana.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_00
 And then we have in the, uh, in the base station, we have the button at the front for, uh, calling, for calling the, uh, banana.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 And the leaf's place, rolls of antennas.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_00
 Actually they do.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_00
 Oh.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_00
 It's, yeah, that's, uh, that's form and function in the one, in the one.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_03
 So it always means whatever the rays goes back, they, they get reflected and then you're having a better coverage.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_03
 It's like antennas.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_00
 So, um, but yeah, that's, um, that's just like, that's an attractive, uh, by stage.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_01
 Great.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_00
 So, okay.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_03
 So what else?

0:05:51	SPEAKER_03
 And for the power source, we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries in this and, uh, the base station is going to have the input from the, uh, power line for, for charging the batteries.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_02
 Is it really weight?

0:06:06	SPEAKER_02
 Is it light or it is very light?

0:06:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_00
 It's about the weight of a banana.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_00
 You know, to give you the correct look and feel.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_03
 And we have put these different colors so that people don't mistake them.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_03
 Mistake it as a banana.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_03
 Otherwise it's, you know, yeah, I think.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_00
 I think a child would try to eat it anyway.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe we should consider that.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_00
 There may be health and safety aspects.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_03
 Mm-hmm.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_03
 Or we didn't think of that yet.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_01
 So for the power source, apparently you use, till you, you want to use both solar cells.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, okay.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_00
 I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary anymore for a recharging base station.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_01
 Well, are you going to place them?

0:06:53	SPEAKER_03
 It'll, it'll always be a top somewhere there.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_00
 If I was going to place them, I'd put them on the, on the top here since that's like.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_00
 Do you have any left or right face?

0:07:01	SPEAKER_00
 You are.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I don't, I really don't think it's necessary to have the solar cells.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because now we are having rechargeable batteries.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_01
 So that is.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_01
 What would be the autonomy?

0:07:09	SPEAKER_00
 Roughly.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_00
 The what?

0:07:11	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:07:12	None
 The autonomy.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_01
 Autonomy.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_01
 What do you mean?

0:07:15	SPEAKER_00
 Hold on, that, hold on, hold on.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_00
 The battery is now.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_00
 Hold on, hold on.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_00
 Hold on.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_01
 Hold on.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_01
 Hold on.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_01
 Hold on.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_00
 Hold on.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_03
 Hold on.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_03
 Hold on.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_00
 You should get a little bit of a weight.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no, no, no.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_03
 It should be worse.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_03
 No, most of the time it's not being used.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so it's.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but when you're looking at it on the basis of time, people, when they'll leave it on the couch so.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_03
 No, eight or eight or ten hours of working.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_01
 If you're just leaving like that, it'll be much longer.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_03
 Weeks.

0:07:45	None
 Yeah, that's right.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_03
 Next slide.

0:07:50	None
 Yeah.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_03
 And we are having the speakers, regular chip for control, pricing is was a factor, so that's why we have gone for our regular chip only, not the advanced chip. And that's it.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, okay, great, this is look at all the ways.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_01
 That's right. Okay, that's very sums, very good.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_01
 Nothing else to add.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I like it. Maybe the thing that convinced me the less is the multi-functional buttons.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_02
 Looks a bit...

0:08:31	SPEAKER_03
 Do you want to have more functional buttons?

0:08:39	SPEAKER_02
 The buttons change, they are functional depending if it's not made or not, we want to keep

0:08:49	SPEAKER_03
 it simple so that this button is what tele-tanks, which is usually also the case. That usually there is a tele-tanks button and once you press that, the channel buttons, they become the scrolling buttons.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_02
 And the volume button will become...

0:09:04	SPEAKER_03
 It's up to you, means.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_03
 Well, in fact, both could be useful in that case. Let's say this can move the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_00
 Or can move between positions in the number.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_02
 What about people who want to use digits?

0:09:20	SPEAKER_02
 But, real buttons?

0:09:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side, because of the shape.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_03
 So we are targeting a segment which is just a very trendy kind of thing that they don't care about the buttons anymore.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_02
 And...

0:09:41	SPEAKER_02
 Have you thought about configuration and all this kind of stuff?

0:09:44	SPEAKER_02
 Also, it's automatic.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_02
 It's very good.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_02
 We are living in a wonderful world.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_01
 Ben and Zib we were.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 We have to go through now the vibrations.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_01
 So, your slide is already.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, you're four if I...

0:10:12	SPEAKER_01
 So this is one.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_01
 Which one is this one?

0:10:14	None
 Yeah.

0:10:15	None
 Okay.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_02
 I constructed a list of criteria.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_02
 Based on the general user requirements.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_02
 And is criteria is...

0:10:34	SPEAKER_02
 We'll be evaluated.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_02
 It's a logical criteria.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_02
 So we must...

0:10:42	SPEAKER_02
 Users must say if it's true or if it's false in a scale ranging from 0 to 7.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_03
 Why this range vector of 7?

0:10:55	SPEAKER_02
 Because it...

0:10:57	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, sorry.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_02
 Usually I see this.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_02
 It's from 1 to 7.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_02
 It's from 1 to 7.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_02
 Because it should be an even scale.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_02
 And 5 is to show and 9 is too long.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, fine.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to be...

0:11:20	SPEAKER_01
 So, in order to have enough granularity.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_01
 The variance is...

0:11:26	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_02
 That's many.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_02
 Great.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_02
 I'm answering your question.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_02
 Go ahead.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_02
 And that's the criteria I found more useful.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_02
 I think I could write the criteria on the whiteboard.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_02
 And we all four could range.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_02
 Could evaluate the...

0:11:48	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_03
 So you can say fancy.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_03
 Handy.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_03
 Handy.

0:12:04	None
 Okay.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_02
 Let's evaluate if it's fancy or...

0:12:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's fancy.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_03
 According to me.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_02
 Seven, but...

0:12:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_01
 Six.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_03
 Seven.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_02
 Seven by me.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_02
 Six.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_02
 I will tell you seven.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_02
 It's quite fancy.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_03
 So you can add seven plus six plus seven plus...

0:12:29	SPEAKER_03
 No way.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_00
 Five.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_00
 Five.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_00
 Five.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe six.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 Six from five.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_01
 Handy.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_03
 Again, add your up seven.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_00
 Seven.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_00
 I'd give it a six.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's probably more handy than my current remote.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_00
 Because of the scroll wells.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_00
 But maybe loses a point for not having the extra buttons when you real...

0:12:59	SPEAKER_00
 If you do need them for some reason.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_00
 But you know, you can always use your other remote.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_01
 So seven, seven.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_00
 Seven.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_01
 Six.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_01
 Six multiplied.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_01
 Functional.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_03
 I'll give five.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_02
 I would say...

0:13:24	SPEAKER_00
 Well, depends when you say functional.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_00
 The main it does what we wanted to do or what it does what.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_00
 It does, you know.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_00
 Everything every coffee.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_00
 Everything remote control.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_01
 Does it have all the capabilities?

0:13:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_02
 It does it compared to the all...

0:13:42	SPEAKER_00
 That's right.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_03
 Remote control.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_03
 S-B-4.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_03
 The standards.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_03
 What is available in the market of the shell?

0:13:49	SPEAKER_03
 I have to say four.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, I didn't know what are the real specification of a universal...

0:13:55	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it's not a universal.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_02
 It's not a universal...

0:13:59	SPEAKER_04
 But it's for all kind of TVs.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_00
 Well, all TVs, but only TVs.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_01
 So it's universal, but 40.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_01
 So four.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_01
 Five.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_03
 Four.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_03
 Four.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_03
 Four.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_03
 So four point two.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_03
 Just four.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_00
 Four.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_00
 But it's four.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_00
 Obviously, there are some outliers.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, cool.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_01
 Cool device.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_03
 There I'll give it seven.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_02
 It means cool features like...

0:14:34	SPEAKER_02
 New features, actually.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_03
 But...

0:14:38	SPEAKER_03
 While a TV, the most important feature which I felt was the locator, which is a cool feature.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_03
 And then the scroll buttons are again cool features.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have LCD for it, but...

0:14:50	SPEAKER_03
 That we decided we don't want to have.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_01
 Seven.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_02
 I'll say five.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_02
 I'll say five.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_01
 Six.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_01
 Seven.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_01
 Two six.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_01
 I say six seven.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_01
 So it's...

0:15:02	SPEAKER_00
 You have seven?

0:15:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_00
 Definitely easy.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_00
 You make least seven.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_00
 Seven.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_01
 Seven.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_01
 Seven.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_01
 And you?

0:15:15	None
 Five.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_01
 I'll tell you.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_01
 Seven.

0:15:19	None
 I'll tell you.

0:15:21	None
 I'll tell you.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_04
 I'll tell you.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_04
 I'll tell you.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_00
 Now here's the $60 million question.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_00
 Well, $25.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_00
 $25 Euro question.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_01
 Of course, I would buy the mine cover.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_00
 What do you guys want?

0:15:37	SPEAKER_02
 Of course, the more difficult question for the end.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_03
 I'll say five.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_01
 $25 Euro.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_02
 I find it quite cheap, actually.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if...

0:15:51	SPEAKER_02
 The price of your living Switzerland or your living...

0:15:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_01
 So the target price is for all Europe, only for rich countries.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_01
 It's more targeting UK or...

0:16:02	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_02
 The initial specifications were for the whole Europe or...

0:16:08	SPEAKER_01
 So this is selling cost, not production cost.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, this is the initial specification.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, sure.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_01
 Um...

0:16:15	SPEAKER_01
 About...

0:16:16	SPEAKER_02
 About the six.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_02
 It's quite cheap, actually.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_00
 I'd say two.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_00
 What?

0:16:23	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think I'm going to make a group table.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_03
 It would be nice.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_03
 It would be handy, actually, if you see.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_03
 It is handy.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's so handy.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_00
 It's handy, but it's terrible.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_03
 Anybody who comes to your home, he at least asks one.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_03
 So what is this?

0:16:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but it's not a positive thing.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_03
 It's a very positive thing, actually, like that.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_00
 It's handy.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_00
 It's ergonomic, but it's a banana.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_01
 Don't forget...

0:16:49	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, targeting also.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_01
 Wow.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, maybe it's an eye.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_01
 Eye would buy this.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_01
 No, well, yeah.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_01
 Eye would be...

0:16:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yogg.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_01
 Not turning that your eye would be.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_01
 Like a teenager, for instance.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_00
 No, it's eye.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_00
 Eye would buy this.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_00
 You're...

0:17:07	SPEAKER_01
 You're a crazy teenager and you like fun things.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_01
 You want to flaunt with your girlfriend or something.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you want to show the beautiful banana you have?

0:17:15	SPEAKER_03
 On my beat and some other kind of thing, but...

0:17:17	SPEAKER_00
 Still, I'd say two.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think I, at any stage in my life, I would want to ban on or my control, really.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, crazy.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_00
 I can say maybe there isn't market for it.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah, no, no.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_03
 So you say two.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_03
 Eye is a five.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_01
 I say five.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_01
 You say?

0:17:31	SPEAKER_02
 I change the question.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_02
 So what's your question?

0:17:38	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah, I've loaded...

0:17:41	SPEAKER_02
 You don't have to reload?

0:17:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think so.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so it depends if...

0:17:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's two different situations.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_02
 If you really need an universal remote control or if you...

0:18:01	SPEAKER_02
 Good change your remote control for a new one.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, if I had to spend 25 euro.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_00
 If that was like my limit, maybe I would buy it.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_00
 Because the other 25 euro remote controls are probably going to look worse than a banana.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_03
 And they might not be as easy as that.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, this is going to, you know, handy to use.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_02
 So, what now?

0:18:27	SPEAKER_02
 I stick with it.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_00
 I go...

0:18:29	SPEAKER_00
 Although it still has the word, of course, at the beginning.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_00
 So, I don't know.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I give it a...

0:18:40	SPEAKER_00
 I give it a four now.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_02
 So we are...

0:18:43	SPEAKER_02
 Six, six, five, four.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_02
 Six?

0:18:47	SPEAKER_02
 So it's now five point five.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_01
 So, last question, will I change my remote control for a man, the man, the man, the...

0:19:09	SPEAKER_01
 Zero?

0:19:11	SPEAKER_01
 No, we can't.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_01
 So one.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, yeah.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if it's the same thing, I will.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_01
 I'll put two.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_00
 I'd say three.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, my remote control is going to, at home, is pretty terrible.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_00
 If it was, change my remote control of my DVD player for a man, the man, the man, the man, would be more inclined to.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_00
 For the TV.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_00
 But, because it's really bad.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_00
 But, I'd say three.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_03
 I would still give it five.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_03
 Five?

0:19:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_02
 Two, three.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_04
 It's a romantic, really.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_01
 I would say two.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_01
 And two.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_01
 So it's three point five.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, three point five.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 Who is the Adlier?

0:19:58	SPEAKER_02
 Do you set five?

0:20:01	SPEAKER_02
 No, I set five.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_01
 You set five.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_01
 He's the Adlier.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, just do some.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if it's...

0:20:13	SPEAKER_00
 It's not very promising, but, you know...

0:20:16	SPEAKER_02
 Because there are more...

0:20:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_02
 We shouldn't sound like that.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_01
 Well, maybe we should...

0:20:24	SPEAKER_02
 Because the last two questions are much more important than the rest, actually.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_02
 Otherwise, we would not sell.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_00
 So some formula you're using that says you have to sound the most?

0:20:35	SPEAKER_02
 No, I didn't prepare anything.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_00
 Well, just leave it at that then.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe we should stick to a general feeling.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_01
 We can have out of these numbers.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_01
 Which is that.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we should go for it.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_02
 Do you want me to sound?

0:20:58	SPEAKER_00
 No, I think it's not...

0:20:59	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's...

0:21:00	SPEAKER_00
 You just lose information if you're sound.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_01
 So let's move on.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_01
 Let's move on.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, sure.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, sound, now you have to estimate the cost.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_01
 So I prepare an exit...

0:21:19	SPEAKER_01
 an exit sheet.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we're going to calculate the production cost.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_01
 We should...

0:21:26	SPEAKER_01
 We should be below 12.5.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_01
 So I already put some numbers here.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to go through...

0:21:39	SPEAKER_01
 So this is the number...

0:21:41	SPEAKER_01
 number of components we need for this thing.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_01
 So it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_01
 And also things that I forget to put like solar cells.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, we decided against the solar cells.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_00
 So yes, finally we say no.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so let's go...

0:22:01	SPEAKER_01
 Let's go...

0:22:02	SPEAKER_01
 Let's go through all the lights.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_01
 So how did the demo...

0:22:05	SPEAKER_01
 This is something we didn't thought about.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_00
 But...

0:22:08	SPEAKER_00
 You mean, charging it by shaking the banana?

0:22:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_03
 I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_01
 To bring the cost.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so we'll stick to battery one.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_01
 Not kinetic.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_01
 Also, why don't you see the difference between kinetic and handino?

0:22:28	SPEAKER_00
 Well, maybe Donomo is like...

0:22:30	SPEAKER_00
 You have to actually...

0:22:31	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, you have to...

0:22:33	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, see, so kinetic is really shaking the banana.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_01
 Crazy.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so...

0:22:41	SPEAKER_01
 So it's better than I thought.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that's fun.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_01
 Let's go ahead.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_01
 So we only have one for battery and then for electronics.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_01
 So I didn't put anything for the moment.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_03
 So we have the regular chip on the print.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_03
 Which is one.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_01
 And that's it.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_03
 So we hit...

0:23:03	SPEAKER_03
 And we have sample speaker.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the cost of that is very...

0:23:08	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_01
 The cost is crazy.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_00
 Well, actually, that sample speaker is not...

0:23:13	SPEAKER_00
 We're not using that.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_00
 We're just using the...

0:23:16	SPEAKER_00
 The beep.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_00
 The very beep, simple beep.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_00
 That sample thing is like the voice recording and everything.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_00
 So I'll remove it.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I say that...

0:23:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_03
 And we have...

0:23:28	SPEAKER_01
 So don't we need the...

0:23:33	SPEAKER_01
 Well, there is no listing for radio frequency.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_01
 Radio frequency thing.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_03
 So we will put some extra.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_03
 If there is...

0:23:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, maybe.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_01
 We'll see later.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so for the case...

0:23:44	SPEAKER_01
 I put single-curve.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_03
 To reduce the cost.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_03
 It's okay.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_00
 Well, wait a second.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_00
 Because we think...

0:23:52	SPEAKER_00
 It's double-curve.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_00
 It's got a...

0:23:54	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, it's got all that direction, so don't worry.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_00
 Well, yeah, it's monotonic.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_00
 But...

0:24:00	SPEAKER_00
 It's got all the direction.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_00
 It's got... but if you hold it...

0:24:05	SPEAKER_00
 If you hold it that way...

0:24:07	SPEAKER_00
 That's two-curve.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_00
 One on the side, one on that side.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_00
 But the...

0:24:12	SPEAKER_00
 Up on the sides.

0:24:13	None
 Okay.

0:24:14	None
 Where is this actually?

0:24:16	None
 I mean, this probably...

0:24:17	SPEAKER_02
 I put one here.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_00
 This probably actually costs more than three.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_01
 So let's put one here in the back-er instead of single-curve.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_01
 So we stick to plastic.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 It costs nothing.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_00
 That's right.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_00
 Well, wait a minute.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_00
 No, didn't we say we wanted to rob a...

0:24:33	SPEAKER_01
 No, two...

0:24:34	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if you drop it...

0:24:37	SPEAKER_01
 Two expensive.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_01
 Two expensive.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we need to get...

0:24:40	SPEAKER_00
 We're ready at 11.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_00
 We'll come back.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_00
 We'll come back and see if we can fill it in.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_01
 So I put trouble in one.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_01
 So special color.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_01
 You know?

0:24:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_01
 For the interface, we have...

0:24:54	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have any push buttons.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_03
 No, we have two push buttons.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_03
 We have three.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_03
 No, that is a scroll wheel.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_03
 It'll be put in that.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_01
 No, no.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_01
 We have two scrolls and we have three push buttons.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, I was gonna...

0:25:09	SPEAKER_02
 When you wrote regular chip, you should put two because there is another chip here.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's not a chip.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_01
 This is just radio frequency sync.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_01
 The chip.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_03
 There's no chip there.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_03
 It just...

0:25:23	SPEAKER_03
 I made the signal.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_03
 It's just...

0:25:25	SPEAKER_03
 And the receiver...

0:25:26	SPEAKER_03
 Exhausted and...

0:25:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_02
 It does nothing.

0:25:29	None
 Actually.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_00
 It seems the signal is...

0:25:31	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_00
 Contactable.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_00
 It's a recharge, I think.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_01
 We didn't think thought about integrated scroll wheel push buttons.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I actually did think about it myself, but I thought, you know...

0:25:45	SPEAKER_00
 Because you could potentially...

0:25:47	SPEAKER_00
 You know, you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for...

0:25:50	SPEAKER_00
 Instead of a turbo.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_00
 But, you know, the turbo button does add that extra class.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_00
 You know.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_00
 So, I mean, if we're over budget, then maybe we could rethink that.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_01
 So, no LCD.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_01
 So, for...

0:26:07	SPEAKER_01
 We have no button suplements, right?

0:26:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_01
 Well, in fact, couldn't we consider this button as a button suplement?

0:26:17	SPEAKER_01
 Because...

0:26:18	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, no.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_01
 These are for colors.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_01
 And special forms, special colors, and special materials.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_01
 No, we're not...

0:26:24	SPEAKER_01
 We don't need anything special.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_03
 So, we are over-object.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_03
 So, first thing we should take care of is...

0:26:32	SPEAKER_00
 Make it plastic and forever.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_00
 Make it plastic and forever.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_00
 Let it be plastic.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_00
 And then we're basically on budget, except for, you know, $0.10.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_03
 And that much money will be required for the base station, which is not there.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:43	None
 Yeah.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_01
 So, maybe...

0:26:48	SPEAKER_01
 In fact, we have to put two here.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_01
 Because it costs nothing.

0:26:55	None
 Yeah.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_00
 The base station is made out of many...

0:27:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_03
...maybe 90 centums for the remaining things, which the card and everything is available.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_01
 Exactly.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_01
 So, we have margin for that stuff.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_00
 That's right.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_00
 Is that included charging, circuitry, and...

0:27:10	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, maybe.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, good.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_01
 Why?

0:27:15	SPEAKER_01
 Exempt.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_00
 So, what do we do with the extra profits?

0:27:23	SPEAKER_01
 We'll invest in R&D.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_00
 Let me extort it.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_01
 So, well, we're under the cost.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_01
 So, we can go through two project evaluation.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so now we have a product which nobody would buy.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_02
 Would...

0:27:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it would buy.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_01
 No, we have a product.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, because none of us would buy.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's people in Milan and in Paris.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_00
 And we'll try to kind of buy it.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_00
 Massively, yeah.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_00
 We're not in Milan or Paris.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_00
 You have been in Milan a couple of times, so.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, there were a lot of batteries.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_02
 And you said the lowest.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_00
 The lowest is expensive.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_02
 This is what we would choose.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_02
 The touchable battery.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, because I'm sick of...

0:28:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but what about that is?

0:28:14	SPEAKER_01
 Extra battery, yeah.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so, I'm going to...

0:28:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so, project versus.

0:28:24	None
 Wow.

0:28:25	None
 In fact, I didn't know...

0:28:28	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't know really what to say here.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_01
 If you have any ideas or what we can say.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_01
 So, I don't understand what they mean by a satisfaction.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_01
 An example.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_01
 Should it be more like a status of these meetings, in fact.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well, in fact, we use a little bit of the white ball and the digital pen, not that much.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_00
 I think we had a fair bit of creativity.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah, it's really creative.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_00
 But I think one thing we missed out of this sole process was a...

0:29:17	SPEAKER_00
 Like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_00
 We needed some of these kind of young trans artists to come in and play with the banana.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_00
 And, you know, see if they...

0:29:29	SPEAKER_00
 They liked it.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_00
 See if they like it.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, maybe we should go through, yeah, in the innovation.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_00
 Because, yeah, the evaluation for us is kind of pointless.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_01
 So, maybe you should do kind of evaluation in the streets like asking to young people.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_01
 Do you like to have a banana as a remote control?

0:29:50	SPEAKER_00
 Because it would also be interesting to find out if we have a market in really young children as well.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_00
 To see, you know, how to market this thing.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_00
 Because, you know, well, I mean, maybe you don't want to give all your kids their own remote because they'll be changing the channel all the time.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_00
 You know, maybe in some households where there is, you know, TV for each kid.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_00
 Then, you know, banana remote control could be fun for them as well.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_00
 Might as well draw a face on it.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_00
 So, but I think that's something we need to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_01
 Any new ideas we could investigate next time, don't know, around cheese?

0:30:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the cost of the thing can be made more than, maybe.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_03
 Because I think it's just the optimal what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think there are ways we could maybe simplify the interface.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_00
 Well, just the circuit board that we're using inside, I don't know how complicated our needs are.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, what we have is two push buttons and two scroll goes.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_00
 Do we really need an integrated circuit to process that?

0:31:10	SPEAKER_02
 So, I'm more general remote control instead of just focusing on TV.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_02
 The complexity shouldn't be much higher.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_00
 You said if it goes for DVD, then I can also say for mood lighting and stuff that would be rather cool.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's actually something that should be in version two.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_00
 Is the ability to control things up in the TV and not just electronic equipment, but the whole environment of the room.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_01
 Very good.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_03
 So, what else?

0:31:52	SPEAKER_01
 Well done. I think we can go home.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_01
 Home? I'm pleased that is right.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, maybe we can ask the production department to make a real prototype that we can use at home to evaluate.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so thanks very much.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_04
 Bye. Thank you. Bye.

0:32:25	None
 We didn't get the proper design that we didn't get fried in it so quickly.

0:32:29	None
 Yeah, we can also...

0:32:34	None
 Was it longer than the others?

0:32:37	None
 Okay.

0:32:39	None
 Okay.
