0:00:00	SPEAKER_04
 Can you leave some on for a time?

0:00:07	SPEAKER_01
 It looks like a needle for all time.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_04
 And to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_04
 And the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-RSI.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_04
 Prototype presentation.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_05
 I think that would be you.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_05
 Me and William worked on a prototype and I think William is going to make a presentation on that.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_05
 So I show.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_05
 I'll show you the presentation.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_05
 Can I just make it?

0:01:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, yes.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_04
 I'll get it.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_04
 Great.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_05
 Well, it looks.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_05
 It looks crazy over here.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_05
 Crazy on.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, there the hand is.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_05
 So this is our look and feel presentation.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_05
 The final, our final presentation.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_05
 And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've come up with over there.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_05
 It's going to have a plastic body with a sort of standard colour, either with thinking of something fairly neutral like a white or a light blue or something.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_05
 It's underneath the rubberized, the rubberized outer casing, which there'd be sort of a wide choice.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_05
 They would be attached, but we can we can count with it.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_05
 The wide choice of colours and sort of patterns.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_05
 So you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_05
 It's obviously in a sort of clamshell design.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_05
 And the top LCD screen you can see there would be sort of...

0:03:24	SPEAKER_05
 How do you say this?

0:03:25	SPEAKER_05
 It would be sort of in set into the top and the buttons at the bottom would say so it would fully close flat.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, right.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_05
 And working on the inside with already said decided on the kinetic batteries, which actually thinking about it now, you could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well so that you could probably get a bit...

0:03:54	SPEAKER_04
 It's a bit in the top section rather than bottom section because it's in the top section.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_05
 We decided that the voice recognition system did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get hold of.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_05
 So we presume that they'd also be quite cheap.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_05
 So you'd have something like, where you'd shout out, where is the remote, and it'll shout back, I'm here or something.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_05
 And then, yeah, it won't shout out, I'm here or something. It'll just shout out, I'm here.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_05
 Or something too similar.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_05
 Or that would be too bad.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, if it was getting that...

0:04:37	SPEAKER_05
 Well, that could be something for next time, maybe.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_05
 You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_05
 The standard transmission with the TV using all the standard chips that we've talked about.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_05
 It would have obviously, because it's split over two different layers, it would need two separate PCBs that would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_05
 And because obviously all TVs use this, the same infrared medium, we'd just be using the same thing to transmit the data.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_05
 And the infrared sender would be on one of the bottom layers just at the front of the...

0:05:27	SPEAKER_05
 I don't think we actually put it on.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, yeah, someone would have...

0:05:32	SPEAKER_05
 Inferred could be...

0:05:33	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, on the front, on the front side of that, yeah.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_05
 All right, yeah.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_00
 So even if it's open here, the thing that's not open here.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_05
 So when you've actually got to open it, it would be facing the TV.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_05
 And then finally, onto the interface.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_05
 The top screen, as we said, would be an inset black and white LCD touch screen, which...

0:05:57	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, would have all of the available functions for the remote on it.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_05
 Whereas the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons, like the volume up and down, channel up and down, power on and off.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_05
 And things do that effect.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_05
 And now, we also decided on the inside, we could possibly either have some kind of sort of bezeled logo on it or something inset or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_05
 But not interfering with that.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_04
 No, not at all.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_05
 No, not interfering with the whole look of the product when it's out on the thing.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_05
 And finally, that's how we put the fashion back into electronics.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_05
 Thanks very much.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_04
 That's a company logo.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_04
 Rapping it all out.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_04
 I've now got evaluation criteria.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_04
 Certainly.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_00
 So this is the one.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_01
 Oops.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_01
 That was a bad wish.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_00
 I think this is a little bit cheap.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_04
 It's quite similar to what it was before there.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_03
 This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the criteria that we got from our market research.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_03
 So this is the first stage of the evaluation.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_03
 Now, the collection of the criteria as we saw in our previous meeting was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_03
 So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_03
 Are we actually meeting those trends and requirements?

0:08:08	SPEAKER_03
 Now, the findings that we came up with just a recap are here.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_03
 The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_03
 Technological innovation.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_03
 It should be easy to use.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_03
 It should incorporate current fashion trends and those the two main ones.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_03
 They were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colors.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_03
 The design should minimise our SI and be easy to locate.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_03
 And we were still slightly unbivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_03
 That did seem to be the favourite strategy.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_03
 But there was also on the sideline the thought of maybe having a beeper function.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_03
 So we can come back to that slide if you don't have a note of those.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_03
 I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this to what we have so far.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_03
 We're going to use a seven point scale where one is true in seven is false.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_03
 We'll look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_03
 I'll call that slide back up.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_03
 And I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the white board here.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_03
 Does that seem clear? Any questions there?

0:09:11	SPEAKER_03
 So we're going to look at these.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_00
 Is it everybody's going to evaluate or just the more clear?

0:09:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yes. We're going to discuss each one and we'll come to our consensus rating between one and seven.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. One is true, seven is false.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_03
 So I won't write all of that out again.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_03
 It will just be criteria one, two, three, four, five, six, or ABCDEF to confuse it with the number rating.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_03
 This is where I realize how tiny I actually am.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_04
 Just right, Farley.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just going to do a few more criteria and rating.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, it might be an idea if we each did give our own a division rating and we could take an average at the end.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_03
 How about that?

0:10:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you're going to be okay.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_03
 So I'll just separate the ratings by your bleeks and if we go one, two, three, four, we know who's here.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_03
 Criteria A, the fancy looking feel.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_03
 How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy, is a fancy looking feel?

0:10:27	SPEAKER_03
 One is true, seven is false.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_03
 My own rating for that would be a two.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_03
 One is true and seven is false.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_04
 How do we do that?

0:10:39	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I'd probably put it two, two or three, no three, three.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_02
 As in two.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_00
 How would you fall?

0:10:54	SPEAKER_03
 I'll fall.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_03
 I think that is up.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_03
 We've got six and a five, eleven divided by four is what?

0:11:02	SPEAKER_03
 Two and three quarter for that?

0:11:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_03
 Two and two quarter?

0:11:07	SPEAKER_00
 I think so.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_03
 Two point seven five, there we go.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_03
 Criteria B, Criterion B.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_03
 Technologically innovative.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_03
 I would give that a three.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_05
 I'd give it a one.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_03
 Not that you're biased.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, not at all.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_03
 The designer.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_02
 A two.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, sorry, no, I got it wrong.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_00
 The first one rating, I'm sorry.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_00
 Can you just make it two?

0:11:45	SPEAKER_00
 The average?

0:11:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I just thought it was a two.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_00
 You want your rating to be a two?

0:11:50	SPEAKER_03
 Is that what you're saying?

0:11:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I just got it.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_03
 So I'll work out the average for that again at the end.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_03
 It's a very slightly altered.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just waiting for your rating to point five for that one.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_03
 Two point five, okay.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_03
 Using one decimal point is a big short.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_03
 So you're rating for this one, huh?

0:12:13	SPEAKER_03
 Two, okay.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_03
 So that is eight, that brings it down to two.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_03
 Two.

0:12:20	None
 Yeah.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_03
 Easy to use.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_03
 Easy to use.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_03
 Based on what you've said there, I would say one.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_03
 Two.

0:12:30	None
 Two.

0:12:31	None
 Two.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_05
 I would say two.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_05
 Two.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_05
 Two.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_04
 I should have said a two to make the arithmetic.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_04
 We'll just put almost two because we're not going to get into silly decimal places.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_03
 We want to really bring it down.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_03
 We can do later.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_03
 Now we're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_03
 And that's particularly in relation to our market research finding about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colour.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm just thinking before I give it my rating, you were limited in the use of materials for your approach of type here.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_05
 Is this actually going to be the colours that you choose?

0:13:24	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_05
 The base colour was like all light blue.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_05
 Like all light blue.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_05
 Or sort of a light blue.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_05
 But the changeable facies would allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_05
 It's full sort of customer.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_03
 It's a bit of a different colour.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_03
 So that's what we're going to do.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_03
 And the spongy feel is no problem with that.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_03
 No, no.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_05
 The spongy feel would be in a rubber that you put round it.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_05
 Otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_03
 In that case it's got to be a one for me.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I'll give it a one as well.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_02
 Everybody okay?

0:14:03	SPEAKER_00
 One.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_03
 That part was an opening.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_03
 Moving on to does the design minimise the repetitive strain and do...

0:14:15	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think we've really touched on that.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_03
 We've discussed it.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_03
 We haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_03
 We've talked about pointers but the very use of a remote control.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_03
 If you're someone who's laughing, who's sitting around and we found so many people did.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_03
 How do you minimise that such a small debate?

0:14:31	SPEAKER_04
 Well the type of button that we're going to use in the bottom here.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_04
 The material.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_04
 The mice and psaricide.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_04
 Mentue.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe because it's like with the size of the guy.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_04
 It's quite small but with the amount of stuff we put on it isn't that much.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe because there's more space not kind of moving around to the...

0:14:53	SPEAKER_04
 He had accurately the buttons in between right?

0:14:56	SPEAKER_04
 It's quite obvious just big buttons.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_03
 I think I'm going to have to be neutral on that and give it a little bit more.

0:15:03	None
 Yeah.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah I...

0:15:06	SPEAKER_05
 I gave her five at the time.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_05
 Five at the time.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_02
 Four and...

0:15:13	SPEAKER_02
 Four.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_02
 Four and a half.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_02
 Twenty one.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_02
 Twenty one so that's four point two five.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_03
 And finally last but not least.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_03
 Easy to locate.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_03
 So we talked about voice recognition.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_03
 We talked about a beeper.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_03
 We really never had to come to any...

0:15:34	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah it was a voice recognition.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_03
 It was the honest recognition.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_03
 And we're happy with the costs and that.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah yeah that.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_05
 Cost wise.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah that's feasible.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_03
 That sounds good then.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_03
 I'd go for...

0:15:48	SPEAKER_03
 We can adjust the volume on that just as we could volume on TV.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_03
 I think you...

0:15:53	SPEAKER_03
 Some of the other room on TV's different rooms.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_05
 I think it would probably be a stand...

0:15:59	SPEAKER_05
 It would be a stand...

0:16:00	SPEAKER_05
 It would be quite loud.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_05
 Everything.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_05
 So it would be...

0:16:04	SPEAKER_04
 And if you didn't hear it in the room you were standing in then you realise it wasn't in that room.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_03
 It's logical.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_03
 That's the one for me.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah one.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_03
 One.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_03
 One.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_02
 And one.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_05
 I do realise we might be being fairly biased because it is a problem.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_03
 So how do we feel about this?

0:16:26	SPEAKER_03
 We've got our...

0:16:27	SPEAKER_03
 The highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the six criteria there.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_03
 That is for incorporates current fashion trends and of easy to locate.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_03
 The lowest rating we've got which is really...

0:16:43	SPEAKER_03
 It's not terribly low, it's close around neutral is for the minimisation of repetitive strain injury.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_03
 Do we feel on the basis of that of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it or do we have to make further modification?

0:17:01	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think so.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_04
 I think so.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_03
 I think for most of those rating that is high enough that the upper end of this scale goes ahead with that.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_03
 And I really don't if on the basis of current technology and of current capability you could actually do much...

0:17:18	SPEAKER_03
 Do you march in the middle of the night?

0:17:19	SPEAKER_02
 I'm having a huge big...

0:17:21	SPEAKER_03
 I know.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_03
 And I hope that the clear to the team is there anything you would like to ask me about the findings for...

0:17:29	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not...

0:17:30	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not...

0:17:33	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to do it there.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, thank you.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, I've got finance in there.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to plug this in so you can see it.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_04
 That's okay.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_00
 Do you want me to unplug that?

0:18:00	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:18:02	None
 Okay.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_01
 So this...

0:18:19	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_04
 Now I presume that the screen will be applied.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_04
 That...

0:18:45	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_04
 We just type numbers into this and we come out the final value.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_04
 So I was still on for kinetic.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. So it would have been handy to have this beginning.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_04
 It might have been a starting choice.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_04
 What's happening with the electronics?

0:19:08	SPEAKER_05
 There's regular chip on print and...

0:19:18	SPEAKER_05
 Oh no, no, no.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_05
 The...

0:19:21	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it's...

0:19:22	SPEAKER_05
 You've put in three for the number of kinetic cells.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_05
 There should just be one.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_05
 In the top, it's the number.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, right.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_04
 Thanks.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, and...

0:19:35	SPEAKER_04
 So would there be two?

0:19:36	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, just...

0:19:37	SPEAKER_05
 No, one rig...

0:19:39	SPEAKER_05
 One chip?

0:19:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, one of them had one sample sensor and sample speed.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_05
 And a double curve.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_05
 Single one double curve.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_05
 Two, because it's too low.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_03
 So it has a slightly flat and bottom third conflict.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_04
 So what's a single curve?

0:19:59	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I'd say it always...

0:20:01	SPEAKER_05
 It's a one bottom with one curve.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I think it's...

0:20:05	SPEAKER_04
 So there's one double curve.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_05
 And what, no, because one...

0:20:09	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, one's double curved and then the other one is...

0:20:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's a bit flat, but it's slightly flat and the bottom sort of goes...

0:20:16	SPEAKER_04
 Plastic and rubber, from the way.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_00
 Plastic one and maybe a double point color.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I like it.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_00
 No, I think rubber, since it's being used just as a casing, we can put 0.5.

0:20:31	None
 Yeah.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_04
 Do you think?

0:20:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because there are...

0:20:35	SPEAKER_00
 I think it allows the 0.5 here.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_00
 We can use that.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_03
 What does it mean if you put 0.5?

0:20:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we're using a lot of rubber actually, because...

0:20:46	SPEAKER_00
 I would be like saying we're using a very low quantity of rubber, compared to plastic.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_04
 See, it says case material.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_04
 So we're not actually using plastic in a case?

0:20:57	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, it's as an extra.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_04
 It's pretty interesting.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_05
 So that shouldn't be actually on there, because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_05
 You get...

0:21:07	SPEAKER_03
 But it is going to be part of the total cost and there's nowhere else we can put that in, is there?

0:21:11	SPEAKER_03
 There's nowhere else we can code for the rubber used in the casing.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_03
 So do we not have to account for it in a cost somewhere there?

0:21:17	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, we'll just put it in as...

0:21:20	SPEAKER_04
 We'll put it in as half.

0:21:22	None
 Okay.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_04
 We should just put it in as one, because plastic is either anyway.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, okay.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_05
 There we go.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, special colour, do you believe that?

0:21:34	SPEAKER_03
 Night do.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_03
 If we go for some of them, we'll exotic rubber jeans and such light colour.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_04
 Interface.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_05
 Push button.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, the push buttons, one and L.C. display one.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_05
 One and buttons.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_05
 One and buttons.

0:22:21	None
 You I think we could change the battery also, so we're going for kind of the hovered, going for the standard battery.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_03
 If you click off that square now, I mean, any difference.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it's on the front light.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_04
 It's on the front light.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_03
 So it's on curved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved things,

0:23:10	SPEAKER_00
 and then to make a difference. On curved flat.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's not made any difference, right?

0:23:18	SPEAKER_03
 No, well, it's just prizes.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_05
 No, no, you've got to click off to calculate it again.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, there we go.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_04
 It's slightly.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_05
 It might be assuming that that is in Euros, it could be in dollars.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_05
 And then would be fine because the exchange rate may get better.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_04
 We haven't been dealing with dollars though.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's some new ones.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so the highest we've got is the electronics here.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_04
 And the engine base.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_03
 If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery, and just going to do a number of batteries without making a huge difference.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, the standard.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_05
 It would make one difference.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_05
 The biggest one would be taking away, if you took away.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_00
 What I feel is customers never said anything about the battery.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_00
 It's internal.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_00
 Nobody looks into the battery.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_00
 But shape and color.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_05
 If you take away the voice, I don't like to say it.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_05
 If you take away the voice recognition, then you've got it.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_00
 Voice that's a special color.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_03
 Do we see what difference it made?

0:24:23	SPEAKER_03
 Where is the voice recognition?

0:24:25	SPEAKER_05
 It's sample, sent to sample speaker.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_05
 Took away that, they'll make it 12.35.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_04
 Well, the kinetic is 3.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_04
 If we change it to the battery, that's minus 3.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but you minus 3 plus 2.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, right.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_04
 We can do it some other way.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't have to be voice recognition.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_04
 We could do the voice recognition for business class or something.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_04
 Like an upgraded version.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_05
 You could choose to have a much better battery.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_05
 But I mean, I don't see why we have to set up 25 years now.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_05
 So they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for a better product.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_03
 But we were still working to...

0:25:14	SPEAKER_03
 So should we just change the size of this location?

0:25:16	SPEAKER_03
 In our recommendation.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_03
 If we're working to head off the specifications, this is what this project is working for.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_03
 We can do in our recommendations with what we've found and what the consensus that we've come to is a job.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_03
 We can.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_03
 But we need to work to that specification to start with.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we can think.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_03
 The voice recognition sounds wonderful, but our object is so distinctive that that in itself we make it easier to locate as you know in our first instance.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_03
 As you say, we can offer the voice recognition an issue to business class customers.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, we can make the price fit and then say...

0:25:50	SPEAKER_04
 And then say, we recommend...

0:25:52	SPEAKER_04
 We would have had this because it also sets apart.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_04
 Because we don't have a background.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_03
 We like to go through that.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_04
 They want to like something that's completely different.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_04
 Because someone completely different associated with your company.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_04
 Right, okay.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_03
 So, if we take voice recognition, I...

0:26:07	SPEAKER_03
 I...

0:26:08	SPEAKER_05
...stow the...

0:26:10	SPEAKER_05
...12.3.5.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, that's what we're talking about.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_05
 Is it 12.50?

0:26:15	SPEAKER_05
 Two sides.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_04
 Is it 12.50?

0:26:17	SPEAKER_04
 No, it's 12.25.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_04
 Are you sure?

0:26:20	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry, not meaning to doubt your work.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, well, two...

0:26:23	SPEAKER_04
...12.25 times two.

0:26:25	None
 I...

0:26:26	SPEAKER_04
...25.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_04
 Are they going to be in a circle by 10p?

0:26:29	SPEAKER_03
 It's 12.5 per unit.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_03
 Now, quite zero, one over euro.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_03
 Which is less than 10p.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know, would...

0:26:42	SPEAKER_00
 It's said 50% is a cost.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_00
 So, half of the price of it.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_04
 The other one was where the price was, isn't it?

0:26:52	SPEAKER_00
 What is the cost for?

0:26:54	SPEAKER_02
 That's today.

0:26:56	None
 12.5?

0:26:58	None
 Yeah.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_02
 So, we are under the...

0:27:01	SPEAKER_04
...12.5?

0:27:04	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, so we are under the...

0:27:06	SPEAKER_02
...12.5.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_02
 So, we are okay.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_04
 So, is that...

0:27:12	SPEAKER_04
...got us covered for the electronics then?

0:27:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_04
 We don't need something else to take that place.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_04
 Nope.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_05
 Because that was just a bolt on X-ray.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_05
 You could just take it out.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_05
 And it would be fine.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_00
 It seems fine.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, thanks a voice for the commission everything is...

0:27:38	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_04
 Done, man.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_04
 Product evaluation.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_04
 We've done room for creativity, haven't we?

0:27:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_04
 We've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_04
 We didn't feel able to make.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_04
 Um...

0:27:57	SPEAKER_04
 A presume we discussed leadership and teamwork?

0:28:00	None
 Uh-huh.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_04
 Um, in the sense that...

0:28:08	SPEAKER_04
...um...

0:28:10	SPEAKER_04
...did you feel like a team or did you feel like?

0:28:14	None
 All right.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_05
 Say, is a team?

0:28:16	SPEAKER_05
 I think we were talking.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_03
 I think we were talking.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_03
 There was so much interaction, so much that we needed to...

0:28:21	SPEAKER_03
...find our soul feature.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_03
 And I've certainly felt heard, listened to...

0:28:26	SPEAKER_03
...on that in relevant areas we've been able to, you know, give and take.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_03
 And adjust our remit.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_03
 We're necessary.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think it was a very constructive feedback by everybody.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_00
 It's not like people trying to cut each other.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_00
 It was more of a through cohesive teamwork.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_00
 We came to a very pretty creative design.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_00
 And, uh... yeah, I think, and Sarah, you coordinated the book very well.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_04
 How did you find it?

0:28:55	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, no, I thought it went really well.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_05
 And I, yeah, I felt that everyone was listening to.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_05
 And all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_05
 But we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_05
 So that's good.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_05
 I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_05
 If we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out, I think maybe it would have come out a little different.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_04
 I like the fact that we could say an idea, and it'd be suggested that there wasn't the best idea, but no one felt like a short time.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_04
 It didn't matter, saying what you got, because if it wasn't something that was that relevant and it didn't matter, it was just another idea.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_04
 And teamwork, well, you too created that wonderful specimen of a play-doh model.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_00
 I think that was the best part of that.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_04
 I'm still not caught up.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_04
 That's nothing to do with the teamwork, though.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we should think of branching it into children's toy, fake mobile phones, or the provide one.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_03
 The fake one.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that was quite fun.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_04
 It means whiteboard digital pens, etc.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_03
 Or the fact that we have to be allowed to use the device, which was for communicating and sharing information.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_03
 Could it have been better?

0:30:27	SPEAKER_03
 Was it adequate?

0:30:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_05
 I think we probably would have used the Azure E-Mouse system more had we actually.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_04
 It had time to kind of.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_05
 It had more time, and if we'd been separated more.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because we could just say, sorry, what do you say about that, or what do you think about that?

0:30:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_04
 Rather than having to imagine it.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_04
 But it was nice having it there.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_04
 Like the whole picture of the thing.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_00
 But it didn't like moving around the room.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's good.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_00
 Like we spend times individually.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_00
 I never thought of a remote control with a flip top.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think it's.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, the following from other areas is bringing things from other areas in.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, nothing in the new.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_03
 But it's applying it to a different area.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_00
 Vegetables.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_00
 That's mine.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_04
 Well, they have to come from somewhere.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_04
 Absolutely.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_04
 And as, as we're shown by your presentation with all of the other controls, remote controls, no one's thought about it.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_04
 Particularly.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, there's slightly differences.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_04
 Someone's been shot in a room and said, make ours a bit different from everyone else's.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_04
 Because there's something we should think about.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_04
 But obviously, no one's putting a great deal of thought into it.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_05
 I don't think the companies are really concerned.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_05
 We've got a DVD player.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_05
 Does anyone remember the remote control?

0:32:29	SPEAKER_05
 Can't you get the one that we used for the last one?

0:32:32	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, just jazz it up with it.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_05
 They don't really think about it.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_05
 Because normally, the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_05
 They're trying to ship the DVD player, the video, the TV.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_04
 But then when everything is really smart.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_04
 And you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table.

0:32:49	SPEAKER_04
 And if you haven't got a book, you can have something that's a proper, funky thing, a funky item, an individual to you.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, they could even go into you going with an idea, a new designer on Photoshop.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_04
 And then they just get it printed on the plastic.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_04
 You would pay a lot extra because it's individually being plastic, it was being made for you.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_04
 But people could have had anything that they wanted.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_00
 And the surprising thing is people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_00
 Every month, you see a new launch or something like that.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_00
 And new television products coming up.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_00
 But nobody giving a much idea to this.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_03
 I think this has been very market research-based.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_03
 Because just going back to mobile phones.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really say is that it's obvious and visible.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_03
 We see it in mobile phones a lot.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_03
 There are innovations in that that people don't really want.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_03
 I see people wanting a model of the phone that we're really happy with and they can't get it anymore.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_03
 It's innovation for innovation's sake.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_03
 And I think it's wonderful that our companies are on deep aid.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it's innovation for money's sake.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_03
 The people have to keep it.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_03
 The first thing it onto people, they might want to buy the thing they've been doing.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_04
 And you can't get your hands at the work's fine, but you can't get battery anymore.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_04
 And with that type of phone, there's the phones have moved on.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_03
 Things like that.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_03
 There's a cover to fit it.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_04
 In closing.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_04
 Close up.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_04
 Our costs are blow budget with recommendations for the budget being increased.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_04
 But I think, I don't know, what do you think?

0:34:36	SPEAKER_04
 Do you think that takes into account overheads?

0:34:41	SPEAKER_04
 Like us being well paid for everything.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_04
 And the heating for the building, do you think our budget includes everything all the costs that are going out?

0:34:50	SPEAKER_04
 I think it was just the product.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_04
 I think that was just the physical.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_04
 So it looks, well, it looks like it's going to be 50% profit.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_04
 It's still gone.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_04
 All of it overheads might have been.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe increasing it, you would also have to increase the price of it.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_04
 So we'll do it.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_04
 But you were saying that that's right.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_03
 And the reason we're giving it a very specific, I think we've done what we're required to do.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_03
 And I think like the other project team or any project we're able to look at, at those kind of things, I don't think that's something we have to look at and underweigh a reading of the cash for.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it was.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_03
 It's done very well to get within budget.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_03
 And it still makes such an innovative item.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_04
 So I think people are really going to want to shame it or never get it.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe they're going to steal our idea.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_03
 It's a top-sanker.

0:35:39	SPEAKER_05
 It's a conspiracy going on here.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_04
 The project has been evaluated well and true.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_04
 And I've got the meeting summary in question here.

0:35:51	SPEAKER_04
 There's a fine question.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_04
 So we've got about 50 minutes to catch up with everything that I've found by God.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_04
 So I'll be delegating it.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_04
 I am in your last project, super rising.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_04
 So good luck.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_00
 Celebration, you've been doggled with that.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_04
 I think that celebration is a 25 times.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_04
 That will be dance in the dance.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_05
 What's that about then?

0:36:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, just the last, I think.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_05
 Awesome.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_04
 I think I've got minutes for two of the meetings and last thing.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_04
 Question, you've done?

0:36:41	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't have to rate you on how much you're influenced the meeting with the time.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_05
 Is that not very question-f, or how you've done in the thing?

0:36:50	SPEAKER_03
 I'm right.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_03
 But do we not sometimes evaluate the meeting?

0:36:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, there it is.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_05
 I think, yeah, question is seven.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_05
 So I'm going to put it in the floor.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_04
 I'll just go.
