0:00:30	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_04
 Minutes. We decided to use a kinetic charger.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_04
 Standard chip, because it can come in various different sizes, it wasn't going to be a problem factor.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_04
 We wanted a standby function. The case materials can be soft, rubbery, changeable.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_04
 Buttons with a combination of LCD and rubber according to design.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_04
 Bright funky designs, inspired by fruit, keeping with the hip kind of feel.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_04
 And to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_04
 And the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-RSI.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_04
 Prototype presentation.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_05
 Is that for us?

0:01:33	SPEAKER_00
 I think that would be you.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_00
 Me and William both don't prototype and I think William is going to make a presentation on that.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, shall I show?

0:01:42	SPEAKER_05
 Do you want to hold it?

0:01:45	SPEAKER_05
 Do you want to hold it?

0:01:46	SPEAKER_05
 I'll see you at the presentation.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yes, yes, I'll get it.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_05
 It looks crazy over here.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_05
 Thank you.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_04
 Just have one last thing you can just take it off.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, that other hand is...

0:02:18	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, so this is our look and feel presentation, our final presentation.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_05
 And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've come up with over there.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_05
 It's going to have a plastic body with a sort of standard color, either we're thinking something fairly neutral like a white or a light blue or something.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_05
 This is underneath the rubberized outer casing, which there'd be sort of a wide choice.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_05
 They would be attached, but we can count with that.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_05
 The wide choice of colors and sort of patterns.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_05
 So you've got a lot of customization with it.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_05
 It's obviously in a sort of clamshell design.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_05
 The top LCD screen that you can see there would be sort of...

0:03:24	SPEAKER_05
 A little black and white touch screen.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it would be sort of inset into the top and the bands at the bottom would say it'll fully close.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_05
 Flat.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_05
 And working on the inside, we've already decided on the kinetic batteries, which I actually think about it now, because you could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well, so that you could probably get a bit...

0:03:54	SPEAKER_04
 Sort of get in the top section now, the bottom section, because it's in the top of the box.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_05
 We decided that the voice recognition system, they did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get hold of, so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_05
 So you'd have something like, you'd shout out where is the remote, and it'll shout back, I'm here or something.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_02
 And then...

0:04:25	SPEAKER_05
 You can think.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_05
 It won't shout out, I'm here or something. It'll just shout out, I'm here.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_05
 Or something too similar.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, if it was getting that...

0:04:37	SPEAKER_05
 Well, that could be something for next time, maybe.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_05
 You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_05
 The standard...

0:04:46	SPEAKER_05
 There's a standard transmission with the TV using all the standard chips that we talked about.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_05
 It would have, obviously, because it's split over two different layers.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_05
 It would need two separate PCBs that would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_05
 And because, obviously, all TVs use this, the same infrared medium would just be using the same thing to transmit the data.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_05
 The infrared...

0:05:22	SPEAKER_05
...sender would be on one of the bottom layers just at the front of the...

0:05:28	SPEAKER_05
 I don't think we actually put it on...

0:05:31	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, someone like that.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_05
 Infrared could be built on the front side of that.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, right.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_00
 So when it's open here, the signal is on the right side.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_05
 So when you've actually got it open, it would be facing the TV.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_05
 And then finally, on the interface, the top screen, as we said, would be an inset black and white LCD touch screen, which...

0:05:57	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, would have all of the available functions for the remote on it.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_05
 Whereas the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons, like the volume up and down, channel up and down, the hour on and off.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_05
 And things to that effect.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_05
 And now, we've also decided on the inside, we could possibly either have some kind of sort of bezeled logo on it or something inset, or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_05
 But not interfering with the...

0:06:40	SPEAKER_04
 No, not actually...

0:06:42	SPEAKER_05
 No, not interfering with the whole look of the product when it's out on the thing.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_05
 And finally, that's how we put the fashion back into electronics.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_05
 Thank you very much.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_04
 That's a company logo.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, don't...

0:06:58	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_04
 I've now got evaluation criteria.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_04
 Certainly.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_00
 So, this is the one.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:07:08	None
 Thank you.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_01
 Oops.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_01
 That was delicious.

0:07:19	None
 Yeah.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_00
 I think this looks like a chip.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_04
 It's quite similar to what it was before there.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_03
 This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the criteria that we got from our market research.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_03
 So, this is the first stage of the evaluation.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_03
 Now, the collection of the criteria as we saw in our previous meeting was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's what we've discussed in the last meeting.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_03
 Are we actually meeting those trends and requirements?

0:08:07	SPEAKER_03
 Now, the findings that we came up with just to recap are here.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_03
 The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel, technological innovation.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_03
 It should be easy to use.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_03
 It should incorporate current fashion trends and those the two main ones that were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colors.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_03
 The design should minimize our eyes and be easy to locate.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_03
 And we were still a slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there, but that did seem to be the favored strategy, but there was also on the sideline, the thought of maybe having a beeper function.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_03
 So, we can come back to that slide if you don't have a note of those.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_03
 I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this, to what we have so far.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_03
 We're going to use a seven point scale where one is true and seven is false.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_03
 We'll look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned, I'll call that slide back up.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_03
 And I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the white board here.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_03
 Does that seem clear? Any questions there?

0:09:11	SPEAKER_03
 So, we're going to look at these.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_00
 Is it everybody's going to evaluate or just some of them?

0:09:16	None
 Yes.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_03
 We're going to come to, we'll discuss each one and we'll come to our consensus rating between one and seven.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_03
 One is true, seven is false.

0:09:26	None
 Right.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_03
 So, I won't write all of that out again.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_03
 It will just be criteria one, two, three, four, five, six or A, B, C, D, E, F to confuse it with the number rating.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_03
 This is where I realize how tiny I actually am.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_04
 Just write, Molly.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_04
 Criteria.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_03
 And rating.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, it might be an idea if we each did give our own individual rating, we could take an average at the end.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so you can.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_03
 So, I'll just separate the ratings by obliques and if we go one, two, three, four, we know who's here.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_03
 Criteria A, the fancy look and feel.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_03
 How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy, is a fancy look and feel one is true, seven is false.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_03
 My own rating for that would be a two.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_03
 One is true and seven is false.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I'd probably put it.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_05
 Two, yeah, two or three. No, three, three.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_02
 Two.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_00
 I would say four.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_03
 Four.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_03
 I think those up.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_03
 We've got six and five, eleven divided by four is what?

0:11:02	SPEAKER_03
 Two and three quarter.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:04	None
 Three.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_03
 Two and three quarter.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_00
 I think.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_03
 Two point seven five. There we go.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_03
 Criteria B, Criteria on B. Technologically innovative.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_03
 I would give that A three.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_05
 I'd give it a one.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_03
 Not that you're biased.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_03
 No, not at all.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_03
 The designer.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_02
 A two.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, sorry.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_00
 I got it wrong.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_00
 The first one reading, I'm sorry.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_00
 Can you just make it two?

0:11:45	SPEAKER_00
 The average.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I just thought you were rating to be a two.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_00
 Is that what you're saying?

0:11:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I just got.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_03
 So I'll work out the average for that again at the end.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_03
 It's a very slightly altered.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just waiting for you.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_03
 Two point five for that one.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_00
 One is a good choice.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_03
 So you're waiting for this one part?

0:12:13	SPEAKER_03
 Two.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_03
 So that is eight.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_03
 That brings it down to two.

0:12:20	None
 Two.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_03
 Ease of use.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_03
 Ease of use.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_03
 Based on what you've said there, I would say one.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_03
 Two.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_05
 Two.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_05
 Two.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_04
 I would say a two.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_04
 A two.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_02
 Two.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_03
 I should have said a two to make the arithmetic.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_03
 We'll just put almost two because we're not going to get into silly decimally places.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_03
 We want to really bring it down.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_03
 Now we're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_03
 And that's particularly in relation to our market research finding about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colors.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm just thinking before I give it my rating, you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_05
 Is this actually going to be the colors that you choose?

0:13:24	SPEAKER_05
 No, the base color was white or all light blue, but the changeable faces would allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colors.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_05
 It's full, full customer.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_03
 And the spongy feel is no problem with that.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_05
 No, no, because that's the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put around it.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_05
 That otherwise is just sort of hard plastic.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_03
 In that case, it's got to be a one for me.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_05
 I'll give it a one as well.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_00
 One.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_03
 That part was nice.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_03
 Moving on to does the design minimize repetitive strain and juice?

0:14:15	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think we've really touched on that.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_03
 We've discussed it, we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_03
 We've talked about pointers, but the very use of a remote control, if you're someone who's zapping, who's sitting like that, we've found so many people did.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_03
 How do you minimize that in such a small device?

0:14:31	SPEAKER_04
 Well, the type of button that we're going to use in the bottom here, the material.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_04
 It's not my society, it's meant to.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe because it's like with the size of the guy, it's quite small, but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe because there's more space, not kind of moving around to accurately the buttons in between, it's quite obvious, just big buttons.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_03
 I think I'm going to have to be mutual on that and give it a four.

0:15:03	None
 Yeah.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I'd go for a five actually.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_02
 Four.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_02
 Four.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_02
 Four.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_02
 Twenty one.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_02
 Twenty one.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_02
 So that's four point two five.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_03
 And finally, last but not least, easy to locate.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_03
 So we talked about voice recognition.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_03
 We talked about a deeper, we really haven't come to any.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it was a voice recognition.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_03
 It was the voice recognition.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_03
 And we're happy with the costs.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah, that's feasible.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_03
 That sounds good then.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_03
 I'd go for, we can adjust the volume on that just as we could volume on TV.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_03
 I think it would be a standard.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_05
 I think it would probably be a standard.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_05
 It would be a standard.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_05
 It would be quite loud.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_04
 So it would be built into, if you didn't hear it in the room, you were standing in and you realized it wasn't in that room.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_03
 Logical.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_03
 That's the one for me.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, one.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_03
 One.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_02
 And one.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_05
 I do realize that we might be being fairly biased because it is a problem.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_03
 So how do we feel about this?

0:16:26	SPEAKER_03
 We've got the highest rating of meeting specifications that is definitely true for two of the six criteria there.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_03
 That is for incorporates current fashion trends and an easy to locate.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_03
 The lowest rating we've got, which is really, it's not terribly low, it's closer and neutral, is for the minimization of repetitive strain engineering.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_03
 Do we feel on the basis of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and produce this as a prototype and market it, or do we have to make further modification?

0:17:00	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think so.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_04
 I think, yeah, I think.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_03
 So I think for most of those rating that it's high enough, at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that, and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capability, we could actually do much more than that.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_03
 And then we're having a huge break.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_03
 I know.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_03
 And I hope that's clear to the team.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_03
 Is there anything you would like to ask me about the findings for a lot?

0:17:30	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to clean it now.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. Thank you.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_04
 I've got finance here.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to plug this in so you can all see it.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_04
 That's okay.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_00
 We do want to plug that.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:18:07	None
 So this.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_04
 Now I presume.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_04
 That scream over that.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_04
 We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_04
 So are we still on for kinetic?

0:18:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_04
 So it would have been handy to have this at the beginning.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_04
 It might have been starting to start choice.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_04
 What's happening with the electronics?

0:19:08	SPEAKER_05
 There's regular chip on print and.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, no, no, no.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_05
 The, um.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_05
 It's you, you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_05
 This should just be one.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_05
 In the top, it's the number.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, right. Okay.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_04
 Thanks.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_04
 So would it be two?

0:19:36	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_05
 Just, no, one reg.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_05
 One chip.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_05
 One of them and one sample sensor and sample speed.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_05
 And they're double curve. No.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_04
 One double curve.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_05
 Two because it's too low.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have a flight.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_03
 We can fit.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_04
 So what's a single curve?

0:19:59	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I'd say, I'd say it was.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_01
 I think, I think it's.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_05
 So just one double.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_04
 One double curve.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_05
 And what no, because one.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_05
 One's double curved and then the other one is.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_03
 Plastic.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_03
 Plastic and rubber.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_04
 That's tickle one and maybe a little one color.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_00
 No, I think rubber since it's being used just as a casing, we can put 0.5.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_00
 Because there are, I think it allows a 0.5.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_00
 We can use that.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_00
 What does it mean if you put 0.5.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_03
 It means we are not using a lot of rubber, actually.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_03
 We are using this.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_00
 We like saying we're using a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_00
 See, it says case material.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_04
 So we're not actually using plastic in a case.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, that's, it's as an extra.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_04
 It's a greeting.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_04
 It's a greeting.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_05
 So that shouldn't be actually on there because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_05
 But it is going to be part of the total question.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_03
 There's nowhere else we can, we can put that in as there.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_03
 There's nowhere else we can code with the rubber used in the case.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_03
 So do we not have to code put in the cost somewhere there?

0:21:17	None
 Okay.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_04
 We'll just put it in as, we'll put it in as half.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_04
 We should just put it in as one because plastic is zero anyway.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_04
 There we go.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_04
 Special color.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_04
 Do we need that?

0:21:34	SPEAKER_03
 You might do.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to go for some of the more exotic ball regimes and such like color.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_04
 Into face.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_05
 Push button.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_05
 The push button is one and I'll see display one.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_05
 One.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_05
 One button.

0:22:19	None
 One button.

0:22:28	None
 One button.

0:22:35	None
 One button.

0:22:39	None
 One button.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_00
 I think we could change the battery also instead of going for kynoting how about going for the standard battery.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_03
 Is that not me Danny?

0:22:58	SPEAKER_03
 If you click off that square now, it doesn't need any difference.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_03
 Was that not?

0:23:02	SPEAKER_03
 No, it was 7.5, it changed.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_03
 So it's uncurbed completely and just actually making the rubber case the curve thing is not

0:23:10	SPEAKER_00
 going to make a difference. Uncode flat.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_03
 It's not me Danny, it's been a minute.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_05
 No, well I just surprised this one.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_05
 No, no, you've got to click off to calculate it again.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, there we go.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_04
 It does slightly.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_05
 It might be assuming that that is in euros, it could be in dollars.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_05
 And then it would be fine because the exchange rate would make it a better point.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_04
 We haven't been dealing with dollars though.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's the new one.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so the highest regard is the electronics here.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_03
 If we turn the interface, if we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery, just like in stone, the battery would make a huge difference.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, the standard, it would make one difference.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_05
 The biggest one would be taking away if you took away.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_00
 What I feel is customers never said anything about the battery.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_00
 It's internal, nobody looks into the battery.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_00
 But shape and color, that's something we should take away.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_05
 If you take away the voice recognition, then you've got it.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_00
 Where's that special form?

0:24:20	SPEAKER_00
 Do we see what difference it makes?

0:24:23	SPEAKER_03
 Where's the voice recognition?

0:24:25	SPEAKER_05
 It's samples sent to sample speaker.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_05
 It took away that they'll make it 12.35.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_05
 Well the kinetic is three.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_04
 If we change it to the battery, that's minus three.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but you've minus three plus two.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, right.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_04
 We can do it some other way.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't have to be voice recognition.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_04
 We could do the voice recognition for business class or something.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_04
 Like an upgraded version.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_04
 You could choose to have that.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_05
 But I mean, I don't see why we have to set up 25 years now because they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for a better product.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_03
 We're still working to...

0:25:13	SPEAKER_03
 So should we just change it to head off?

0:25:15	SPEAKER_03
 Head off.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_03
 Head off.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_03
 We're working to head off the specifications.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_03
 This is what this project team is working for.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_03
 We can do it in our recommendations with what we've found and the consensus that we've come to as a lot of meetings.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_03
 We can.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_03
 But we need to work to that specification to start.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we can say.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_03
 The voice recognition sounds wonderful, but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is going to make it easier to locate as an in our first instance.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_03
 As you say, we can offer the voice recognition initiative to business class customers.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, we can.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I make the price fit and then say, we recommend.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_04
 We would have had this because it also sets up as a product.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_04
 Because we don't have a background.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_04
 Because someone can be different associated with your company.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_04
 Right, okay.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_03
 So if we take voice recognition, I...

0:26:08	SPEAKER_05
 Spell the 12.35.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_05
 Is it 12.50?

0:26:17	SPEAKER_04
 No, it's 12.25.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_04
 Are you sure?

0:26:21	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_04
 Not meaning to doubt your work.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_04
 12.25 times two years.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_04
 25.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_04
 Are they going to be...

0:26:28	SPEAKER_03
 It's 12.5.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_03
 I'm quite zero, one over euro.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_03
 Which is less than 10.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_00
 I don't remember, but it's said 50% is the cost.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_00
 So half of the price was...

0:26:45	SPEAKER_04
 The other one was where the price was not there.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_02
 What is the first one?

0:27:01	SPEAKER_04
 That's two days.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_00
 12.5?

0:27:05	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, so we are under the position.

0:27:08	SPEAKER_02
 So we're okay.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_04
 So, is that...

0:27:13	SPEAKER_04
 Got us covered for the electronics then.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_04
 We don't need something else to take that place.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_05
 Nope.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_05
 So that was just a bolt on X-ray.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_05
 You could just take that out.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_05
 And it would be fine.

0:27:26	None
 Okay.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_00
 It seems fine.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think it was.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_00
 X-A-Boys are good mission.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_00
 Everything is...

0:27:38	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_04
 Done that.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_04
 Project evaluation.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_04
 We've done room for creativity, haven't we?

0:27:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_04
 Got decisions that we would have made that we weren't.

0:27:53	SPEAKER_04
 Didn't feel able to make.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_04
 Appaging we discuss leadership and teamwork?

0:28:03	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_04
 In the sense that...

0:28:10	SPEAKER_04
 Did you feel like a team or did you feel like...

0:28:15	SPEAKER_05
 All right, so it's a team.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_03
 I think we're talking.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_03
 There was so much interaction, so much that we needed to...

0:28:21	SPEAKER_03
 Find out, come together.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_03
 And I've certainly felt heard, listened to, and that in relevant areas, we've been able to give and take, and adjust our remit.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_03
 We're in SSO.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think it is a very constructive feedback by everybody.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_00
 It's not like people trying to cut each other.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_00
 It is more of a through-cohesivity move.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_00
 We came to a very pretty creative design.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_00
 And...

0:28:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think...

0:28:49	SPEAKER_00
 Sarah, you coordinated the work very well.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_04
 How did you find it?

0:28:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, no, I thought it went really well.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_05
 And I, yeah, I feel that everyone was listened to, and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_05
 But they didn't quite make the voice recognition in there, so that's good.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_05
 I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_05
 If we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out, I think maybe it would have come out a little different.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_04
 I like the fact that we could say an idea, and it'd be...

0:29:34	SPEAKER_04
 I suggested that there wasn't the best idea, but no one felt my short time.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_04
 You know, it didn't matter, saying what you thought, because if it wasn't something that was relevant, then it didn't matter, because it was just another idea.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_04
 Mm.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_04
 Um...

0:29:49	SPEAKER_04
 Teamwork, well, you two created that wonderful specimen of a plaido model.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_00
 I think that was the best part of that.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_04
 Uh...

0:30:00	SPEAKER_04
 I'm still not caught up.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_04
 That's nothing to do with the teamwork, but...

0:30:05	SPEAKER_03
 Um...

0:30:06	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys, maybe mobile phones or something like that.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_03
 If they go on...

0:30:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that was quite fun.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_04
 Um...

0:30:17	SPEAKER_04
 Means whiteboard digital pens, etc.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_04
 What does that mean?

0:30:20	SPEAKER_04
 Um...

0:30:21	SPEAKER_03
 I'd be evaluated for materials we had for communicating and sharing information.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_03
 Could it have been better? Was it adequate?

0:30:29	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I think we probably would have used the actual email system more had we actually...

0:30:35	SPEAKER_04
 Had time to kind of...

0:30:37	SPEAKER_05
 Had more time, and if we'd been separated more.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because we could just sort of say, sorry, what did you say about that, or what do you think about that, rather than having to email it?

0:30:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_04
 But it was nice having it there.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_04
 Um...

0:30:51	SPEAKER_04
 Like the whole picture of the thing.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but in like moving around a little.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's good, like...

0:30:59	SPEAKER_00
 We spend time individually...

0:31:27	SPEAKER_00
 I never thought of a remote control with a flip top.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think it's really boring to other areas.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_03
 It's bringing things from other areas in.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, nothing in me.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_03
 But it's applying it to a different area.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_03
 Vegetables.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_00
 It's mine.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, no.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, no.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, no.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_04
 Well, they have to come from somewhere.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_04
 Absolutely, yeah.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_00
 But they...

0:32:01	SPEAKER_00
 As...

0:32:02	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry, guys.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_04
 Um, as we're shown by your presentation with all of the other controls, remote controls, no one's thought about it, particularly.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, they're slightly different.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_04
 So, someone's been shot in a room and said, make ours a bit different from everyone else's, because there's something we should think about.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_04
 But obviously, no one's put any great deal of thought into it.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_05
 I don't think the companies are really concerned.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_05
 They're just, like, we've got a DVD player.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_05
 Does anyone remember the remote control?

0:32:29	SPEAKER_05
 Can't you get the one that we used for the last one?

0:32:32	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, just jazz it off of it.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_05
 They don't really think about it, because normally, the remote control isn't the product, which they're trying to ship.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_05
 They're trying to ship the DVD player, the video player, the TV.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_04
 But then when everything is really smart...

0:32:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_04
 And you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't go.

0:32:49	SPEAKER_04
 If you could have something that's proper, funky thing, a funky item that's individual.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_04
 Individual to you.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, they could even go into...

0:32:59	SPEAKER_04
 You go in with an idea, and they design it on Photoshop, and then they just get it printed on the plastic.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_04
 You pay a lot extra because it's individually being plastic was being made for you.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_04
 But people couldn't have anything that they wanted.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_00
 Surprising to be just like people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_00
 Like every month you see a new launch or something like that.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_00
 And new television products coming up.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_00
 But nobody giving a much idea to this.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_03
 I think this has been very market research-based.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_03
 Because just going back to mobile phones, I mean, this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really say is obvious and visible.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_03
 We see it in mobile phones a lot, and that's where we've heard a lot of ideas from.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_03
 There are innovations in that that people don't really want.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_03
 I see people wanting a model of the phone that really helps you with it, and they can't get it anymore.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_03
 It's innovation for innovation's sake.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_03
 And I think it's wonderful that our companies do R&D based.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it's innovation for money's sake.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_03
 People have to keep up.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_03
 The forcing it on to people.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_03
 Things that, you know, they might want to buy the thing they do.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_04
 And you can't get...

0:34:09	SPEAKER_04
 You've got your hands at the works fine, but you can't get battery anymore.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_04
 And that type of phone is the phones that have been done.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, there's a cover to fit it on the wire.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_02
 That's nice.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_02
 And...

0:34:19	SPEAKER_04
 In closing...

0:34:23	SPEAKER_04
 Closeable.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_04
 Um...

0:34:26	SPEAKER_04
 Our costs are below budget, with recommendations that the budget be increased.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_04
 But I think...

0:34:33	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_04
 What do you think?

0:34:35	SPEAKER_04
 Do you think that takes into account, um...

0:34:38	SPEAKER_04
 Overheads.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_04
 Like, us being well paid for the thing.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_04
 And the heating for the building.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_04
 Do you think our budget includes everything, all the costs that are going out?

0:34:49	SPEAKER_04
 I think it was just the product.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_04
 I think that was just the physical.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_04
 So it looks, well, it looks like it's going to be 50% profit.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_04
 Still gone.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_04
 All of the overheads might have been.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe increasing it.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_04
 You would also have to increase the price today.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_04
 So don't.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think...

0:35:06	SPEAKER_04
 But you were saying that that's correct.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I don't.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_03
 I think in the remake it's very specific.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_03
 I think we've done what we required to do.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_03
 And I think like the other project team, or a new project for us to look at those kind of things.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think that's something we have to look at.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_03
 And the way we're breathing the cash for.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_03
 It was...

0:35:25	SPEAKER_03
 We've done very well to get within budget.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_03
 And we still make such an innovative item.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_03
 So I think people are really going to want to...

0:35:32	SPEAKER_04
 To shame it won't ever get me.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we're going to steal our ideal balance.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_03
 It's top secret.

0:35:39	SPEAKER_05
 It's conspiracy going on here.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_04
 The project has been evaluated well and truly.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_04
 And we've got the meeting summary in question here.

0:35:51	SPEAKER_04
 There's a final question.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_04
 So we've got about 50 minutes to catch up with everything that I felt behind.

0:35:58	SPEAKER_04
 So I'll be delegating it.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_04
 In your last project, superbising.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_04
 So good luck.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_00
 Celebration, you didn't talk about that.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_04
 I think it was celebration at the 25th time.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_04
 That will be dance on the dance.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_04
 That was...

0:36:17	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_05
 Was that it then?

0:36:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_04
 Just the last I think.

0:36:28	None
 Awesome.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_04
 I think I've got minutes for two of the meetings and...

0:36:35	SPEAKER_04
 The last thing...

0:36:37	SPEAKER_04
 It's a question I've done.

0:36:39	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I didn't have to rate you on how much you include the meeting this time.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_05
 Is that not the question asked or the how you thought you'd done in your...

0:36:49	SPEAKER_05
 Thing?

0:36:50	SPEAKER_03
 I'm right.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_03
 But do we not sometimes evaluate the meeting?

0:36:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, there's this.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_05
 I think...

0:36:56	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, question is seven years.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_05
 So I'm going to go to the 40 meeting.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_04
 I just got to...

0:37:02	None
 Okay.
