0:02:12	SPEAKER_02
这样子的困境有什么团团有什么要做然后你有到了我的名字是Daniel Wolves我是Protect Manager

0:02:27	SPEAKER_01
我是Yerun Top我是User Interface我 Name is Jan van Fueren我是 Industrial Designer

0:02:37	SPEAKER_00
我是Tem Vanille我的 Function is Marketing Expert

0:02:42	SPEAKER_02
OK, thank you我是Amy's to make a new remote control maybe you read the website It's a very ambitious company they want to do something else There must be a new remote control First of all, it must be original and trendy it's two things really close to each other but at the same time, it's useful for friendly and they have very important for them There are three stages there's a functional design what are we going to do what are we going to make functions in the remote and why are we going to do it then the conceptual design how are we going to do it and that's really global because at the detailed design how part two we go to dig in really about how the technical if it's possible technical wise each stage is broken up in two stages individual work and a meeting so it's very straightforward OK, the tool training we have two smart boards this one is for the presentations the PowerPoint presentations or the word presentation whatever you had and this is only for drawing so we must let it stand on this program this is called a smart board it speaks for itself and as you may have heard the documents in the Shared folder can be showed on this screen not in my documents so if you want to show something put it in the Shared folder this is very straightforward with the save to print the undo the blank to select the pen well, I don't going to explain it all because I think you know how it works we must not forget everything we draw on here almost be saved we may not delete anything so if you have a draw something save it never delete it that's very important to us OK a little kind of exercise to know each other at the whiteboard on the left every one of us must draw our favorite animal and tell us why we had chosen that animal important is that we use different colors and different pen widths what?

0:05:51	SPEAKER_02
 I have a question

0:05:52	SPEAKER_00
 if this exercise did the company board tell you to do it or did you just make it up

0:06:01	SPEAKER_02
 no no no it's a part of the answer because we really don't know each other and it's kind of new getting used to each other we can have a little fun and before we dig in really to the hearts that kind of thing would you start with drawing your favorite animal?

0:06:20	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know really how it works maybe you can show us first

0:06:25	SPEAKER_02
 drawing goes with this thing do not touch your hand on this little thing here that's important all it's like this you get electrocuted yeah kind of so you must push a little good and wait a few seconds it's a fully real time

0:06:53	None
 so watch it well I'm gonna paint in the red oh that's the background call well undue the pen one minute please yeah that's the one five okay

0:07:51	SPEAKER_00
 my favorite animal it's like a dictionary that's what it is the one who says it first

0:08:06	SPEAKER_02
 got to race

0:08:08	None
 may it paint next it's a fork no it's not an arc you don't see it at the years?

0:08:23	SPEAKER_00
 no I have it at home

0:08:26	SPEAKER_02
 you have an arc at home thank you so it's a cat

0:08:34	SPEAKER_01
 what's it called?

0:08:36	SPEAKER_02
 Sima we have a cat at home and he's called Sima he looks like the lion from the Lion King

0:08:44	SPEAKER_00
 many of the animals

0:08:46	SPEAKER_02
 so we have some kind of cool name it after an alien he's happy with us he's smiling

0:09:05	SPEAKER_01
 he does have body

0:09:07	SPEAKER_02
 now only the face because we have 25 minutes

0:09:11	SPEAKER_00
 we have to speed up remember you use different colors and different pen widths

0:09:20	SPEAKER_02
 okay we want to go next okay choose a color

0:09:30	SPEAKER_01
 you don't have to change the color and the pen width save it

0:09:36	SPEAKER_00
 save it okay I've done that

0:09:44	SPEAKER_01
 okay you have to push hard on the pen

0:09:54	SPEAKER_00
 not ready that one

0:10:01	None
 and that's why we started with the pen case continue on the last file okay open which one is it's on the budget for Pencil okay okay okay thanks okay speed up by the way why was you cat rid?

0:10:53	SPEAKER_02
 my cat is red and I've red hair

0:10:58	SPEAKER_01
 must be red it's a frog it's a turtle it's an apple it must be a dog a dog

0:11:16	SPEAKER_00
 a color something like this

0:11:28	SPEAKER_01
 oh it's a turtle

0:11:32	SPEAKER_02
 why a turtle?

0:11:34	SPEAKER_00
 ten because I like ten-h mutant

0:11:40	SPEAKER_02
 you watched it a lot it's inside the shell it's a scared turtle

0:11:50	SPEAKER_00
 no no no it's coming out wow wow

0:12:06	None
 okay thanks okay thank you very artistic

0:12:17	SPEAKER_02
 you want to go next?

0:12:19	SPEAKER_01
 yes good okay yeah thank you

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 there you go

0:12:27	SPEAKER_01
 yeah how did it work?

0:12:35	SPEAKER_02
 format then you have the current color you can change so no red or green and line with I had five dimmets so what kind of line with the dimmets?

0:12:52	SPEAKER_00
 the big lines were like nine

0:12:56	SPEAKER_02
 okay it's a dog

0:12:58	SPEAKER_01
 well first I just thought I picked the easiest one

0:13:03	SPEAKER_02
 why a dog?

0:13:04	SPEAKER_01
 you have a dog at home? well we had a dog we had a dog and when it died we didn't get a new one

0:13:11	SPEAKER_00
 it's pretty good

0:13:14	SPEAKER_02
 we have an artistic inner middle

0:13:19	SPEAKER_00
 an artist

0:13:21	SPEAKER_01
 a graphical user designer

0:13:24	SPEAKER_00
 thank you picked the wrong function wrong job

0:13:32	SPEAKER_01
 oh no it worked

0:13:37	None
 so I think you can see it's really a easy program to use not difficult at all

0:13:47	SPEAKER_00
 okay thank you that's enough thanks yeah sure

0:13:58	SPEAKER_02
 the last one

0:14:00	SPEAKER_00
 I wonder after a cat, a turtle and a dog

0:14:07	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's going to draw an elephant I figured she should do something like that

0:14:14	SPEAKER_01
 but I'm going to do something much more difficult he is a artistic writer I'm going to design a remote

0:14:25	SPEAKER_00
 a remote control a remote control

0:14:30	SPEAKER_01
 exactly sorry well with the interface it might be easier to draw here yeah

0:14:47	SPEAKER_00
 that might be easier but at the other hand a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand I think it's easier to draw better to draw with a pen and with a mouth

0:15:02	SPEAKER_01
 yeah I mean like a drawing

0:15:05	SPEAKER_00
 drawing and then playing on the screen but this paper was too well

0:15:10	SPEAKER_02
 it's a rabbit yes you ever read it at home?

0:15:14	SPEAKER_00
 no it's a rabbit with broken legs

0:15:18	SPEAKER_02
 it's the white rabbit it's the white rabbit from the matrix

0:15:22	SPEAKER_01
 it's the white rabbit he said a little bit stoned I think it is a pretty good impression of a rabbit

0:15:36	SPEAKER_00
 it will do

0:15:38	SPEAKER_02
 finishing touch and then we go further

0:15:44	SPEAKER_00
 project manager

0:15:47	SPEAKER_01
 with a spingo just

0:15:49	SPEAKER_00
 counting the time

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 yeah a little

0:15:56	SPEAKER_00
 let's go on then

0:16:01	SPEAKER_02
 well I think the dog is the most

0:16:04	SPEAKER_01
 I figured a rabbit was actually the most impressed

0:16:07	SPEAKER_02
 don't choose for yourself ok now we're going to dig into the serious stuff the selling price for the remote will be 25 euro and the production cost may not be more than 20 and a half euro so from my point of view I don't think it's going to be very high-tech high-definition ultra-modern kind of remote for 12-12,000,000 euro the profit we must make with the new remote is 50 million euro so that's a lot we have to sell a lot of bike how much?

0:16:53	SPEAKER_02
 100 million I think when the selling price is 25 you come 2 million or 2 million our marketing rate is international we have virtually the whole world we can sell our remote too at least that country which have a a television so now it's time for us to discuss a little things you can think about experience with remote control yourself at home what you think might be a useful new future what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others so let's discuss a little I'm going to join you at the table well what's the most important thing at remote control?

0:17:57	SPEAKER_01
 well I think the most important thing of remote control is that you can switch channels and my opinion is you can keep it as basic as possible

0:18:06	SPEAKER_02
 so another remote control which can be used for television and DVD and radio

0:18:16	SPEAKER_00
 or just only but I have some points can I show them on the big screen?

0:18:22	SPEAKER_00
 if you have them on my I can find them

0:18:38	SPEAKER_02
 in case you want this is a dead kind of fly between the

0:18:47	SPEAKER_00
 screen

0:18:49	SPEAKER_01
 is it possible to open pen drawings in this

0:18:52	SPEAKER_02
 no no no only all the drawings go there

0:18:56	SPEAKER_01
 but which ones we made on there

0:19:00	SPEAKER_02
 oh that pen drawings no I think when it is in word and you have stated in the shared documents folder you can show with them

0:19:09	SPEAKER_00
 or in word okay I have some points from marketing point of view just a standard thing things like intuitive, small, fairly cheap 25 euros brand independent I think it doesn't have to matter which brand your TV or everything is

0:19:33	SPEAKER_02
 okay five minutes five minutes

0:19:36	SPEAKER_00
 okay I'll wrap it up quickly I personally think it has to be multi-purpose most of remote controls are just for one purpose and by making a multi-purpose it as a new feature, add a new feature to the market and distinguish from current products maybe some other technology than infrared I rather find it very annoying like when someone is standing in front of the TV that you can't switch it think about sending it over radio waves or Bluetooth okay that might be a little bit expensive and something like an LCD screen for what purpose like it said here maybe it's easy it's nice as an added feature that when you run a certain channel you can see on LCD screen work programs are coming up

0:20:42	SPEAKER_02
 so it would be a multi-purpose very technically high from my point of view it must be really innovative technical wise

0:20:55	SPEAKER_00
 yeah that's to be yeah our company is very good in making new enough diff things

0:21:08	SPEAKER_02
 so we must focus on things we really add something

0:21:14	SPEAKER_00
 to the current market look you got some cheap remote controls they just you got a dozen of them but when you enter a new market we're remote control and want to gain market share you have to do something special

0:21:39	SPEAKER_02
 but we have to keep in mind at the beginning of such a project it's very cool to talk about well this would be cool but we must not lose side of the user

0:21:56	SPEAKER_00
 frankly yeah of course but this is just from marketing I don't know anything about user interface

0:22:06	SPEAKER_02
 and that's because we have him and him okay next meeting we'll start in 30 minutes so you will have individual actions where I presume will be some feedback via the mail the industrial designer has to look at the working design the user interface designer has to look at the technical function so we discussed

0:22:42	SPEAKER_01
 one thing we must first agree on what we are going to make are we going to use it for multiple systems or we should have some agreement on that okay

0:22:54	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think we have to agree on that I think that's a phase further just make some mock-ups some general ideas and then we can plan yeah we can plan for I think but maybe because you are working on the user requirements

0:23:24	SPEAKER_02
 you are working on technical functions we must have a little kind of what do you call it?

0:23:38	SPEAKER_02
 a little plan on what we are going to do so you don't come over the user requirements we don't fit the technical functions at all some basic things we want to go into I think that's what we are coming in yeah

0:24:01	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know you decide you are the project manager

0:24:06	SPEAKER_01
 the technical functions have to be designed I've got to know for what kind of machines will be or will we use it a text screen or will it be with Bluetooth

0:24:18	SPEAKER_02
 well that's really a step further but if you say is it one way or multi-purpose

0:24:26	SPEAKER_00
 that's the same step yeah

0:24:30	SPEAKER_01
 why? the individual components

0:24:34	SPEAKER_00
 yeah like we all have a list of things that have to be in it or how it has to be like and then in the next meeting we decide

0:24:46	SPEAKER_01
 what it's going to be

0:24:48	SPEAKER_00
 and then you can delete the the obsolete details

0:24:56	SPEAKER_02
 so each individual individually must think on what's at his point if you is the most important and then we are going to fit all the pieces together the next meeting I'm just finished of now so it's over you will receive specific instructions by your personal coach and I'll see you in 30 minutes thank you

0:25:34	None
 be careful success?

0:25:44	SPEAKER_01
 success

0:26:14	None
 success? success
