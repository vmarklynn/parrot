 Hi.

0:00:02	None
 Hello.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_01
 Hi.

0:00:18	SPEAKER_02
 Good morning.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_02
 Good morning.

0:00:45	SPEAKER_02
 Before I start with the meeting, I have a few things to tell you about the setting we're in, because we're being watched by a big brother.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_02
 By a big brother?

0:00:58	SPEAKER_02
 This is our camera, so are these.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_02
 This thing that looks like a pie are actually all microphones.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_02
 So you must be careful with all this.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_02
 And as I can see, you have placed your laptops exactly on the place where it must be.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_02
 And that has to do with the camera setting, so we don't have our laptops in front of the cameras.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_00
 Of our faces.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_02
 And indeed, so they can see our faces.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_02
 Welcome at the kickoff meeting.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_02
 My name is Daniel Wolf.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_02
 This is the agenda for today.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_02
 First, a little opening. I will introduce myself.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's very good to introduce yourself.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_02
 Then a little bit of acquaintance, acquaintance to ourselves, so we get to know each other.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_02
 That will be done with tool training from these two smart boards.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_02
 Then the project plan, what we're going to do and how we're going to do it.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_02
 And discussion about that and a little closing at the end.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. My name is Daniel Wolf. I'm the project manager.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_02
 What's your name?

0:02:28	SPEAKER_01
 I'm Aaron Tops. I'm the user interface designer.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_02
 User interface, okay.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_01
 Hi, my name is Aaron Forfura. I'm the industrial designer.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_00
 I'm Tim Fannie.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_00
 My function is a marketing expert.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. Thank you.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_02
 First, a little about the project.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_02
 The aim is to make a new remote control.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe you have read the website.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's a very ambitious company.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_02
 They want to do something else.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_02
 There must be a new remote control.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_02
 First of all, it must be original and trendy.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_02
 It's two things really close to each other.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_02
 But at the same time, user friendly.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_02
 They have, yeah, that's very important for them.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_02
 There are three stages. There's functional design.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_02
 So what are we going to do?

0:03:26	SPEAKER_02
 What are we going to make kind of functions in the remote?

0:03:32	SPEAKER_02
 And why are we going to do it?

0:03:34	SPEAKER_02
 Then the conceptual design. How are we going to do it?

0:03:38	SPEAKER_02
 And that's really global.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_02
 Because at the detailed design, how part two, we go to dig in really about how the technical, if it's possible technical wise.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_02
 Each stage is broken up in two stages.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_02
 Individual work and a meeting.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_02
 So it's very straightforward.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, the tool training. We have two smart boards.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_02
 This one is for the presentations.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_02
 The PowerPoint presentations or the word presentation, or whatever you had.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_02
 And this is only for drawing.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_02
 So we must let it stand on this program.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_02
 This is called Smart Board Thing.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_02
 It speaks for itself.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_02
 And as you may have heard, the documents in the shared folder can be showed on the screen.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_02
 Not in the My Chocolate.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_02
 So if you want to show something, put it in the shared folder.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_02
 This is very straightforward with the save to print the undo, the blank, the select pen.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I don't explain it all because I think, you know, how it works.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_02
 We must not forget everything we draw on here.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_02
 Almost be safe.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_02
 We may not delete anything.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_02
 So if you have dropped something, save it.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_02
 Never delete it.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_02
 That's very important.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_02
 A little kind of exercise to know each other at the white board on the left.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_02
 Every one of us must draw our favorite animal and tell us why we had chosen that animal.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_02
 Important is that we use different colors and different pen widths.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_02
 Why?

0:05:53	SPEAKER_00
 I have a question.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_00
 This exercise, did the company board tell you to do it?

0:06:00	SPEAKER_02
 Did you just make it up?

0:06:03	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_02
 It's part of the internet.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_02
 We really don't know each other.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_02
 Getting used to each other, we can have a little fun.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_02
 Before we dig in, really do the hard stuff.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_02
 Would you start withdrawing your favorite?

0:06:21	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know really how it works.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you can show us first.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_02
 Drawing goes with this thing.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_02
 Do not touch your hand on this little thing here.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_02
 That's important.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_02
 All it's like this.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_02
 You get electrocuted?

0:06:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, kind of.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_02
 So, you must push a little good.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_02
 And wait a few seconds.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_02
 It's not fully real time.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_02
 Watch it.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to paint in red.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, that's the background color.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_02
 Wow, Andrew.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_02
 Depant?

0:07:22	SPEAKER_02
 One minute, please.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's the one.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_02
 Five.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_00
 My favorite animal.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_00
 You can guess what it is.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_02
 The one who says it first gets erased.

0:08:10	None
 May I paint next?

0:08:15	SPEAKER_02
 It's a fork?

0:08:18	SPEAKER_02
 No, it's not an arc.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_00
 I have it at home.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_02
 You have an arc at home.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_02
 Very artistic.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_01
 So, it's a cat.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_02
 What's it called?

0:08:38	SPEAKER_02
 Sima.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_02
 We have a cat at home and he's called Sima.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_02
 They're the lion from the Lion King.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_02
 It's kind of cool to name an astronaut lion.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_02
 He's happy with us.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_02
 He's smiling.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_01
 He does have body.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_02
 Now only the face.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_02
 We have 25 minutes.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_00
 We have to speed up.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_00
 Remember you use different colors and different pen widths.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_02
 We want to go next.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_02
 Choose a color.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_01
 You don't have to change the color.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_00
 Save it.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_00
 I've done that.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_01
 You have to push hard on the pen.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_00
 Not ready.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_00
 That one.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_00
 Open.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_00
 Which one?

0:10:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_01
 I've got red.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_01
 It's a fogg.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_01
 It's a napple.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_00
 It's a white color.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_01
 Something like this.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_00
 It's a turtle.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_00
 It's a turtle.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_02
 You watch it a lot.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_02
 It's a character.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_00
 It's coming out.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_00
 Wow.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_00
 Wow.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_01
 You want to go next?

0:12:31	SPEAKER_02

0:12:46	SPEAKER_02
