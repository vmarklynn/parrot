0:00:30	None
 from the Right.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_00
 So, where's that PowerPoint presentation?

0:01:16	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry?

0:01:28	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_00
 So.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_00
 So, we've got new project requirements.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_00
 So, basically we've got three things. We've got 40 minutes in which to, uh, for this meeting to discuss the videos options. Um, three presentations.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_02
 We have a, I guess we have a presentation. So, I've got one. Yeah.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_00
 I see. Right. That's nice to know. One from each of you. Um, new project requirements.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_00
 And so, do we want to do the presentation first or do we want to, um, I got, um, we've used our three things, basically, um, relating to, remote being only for TV. We discussed that last time.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_00
 And in actual fact, I was pretty, pretty well, but we came up with any way.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_00
 So, in fact, actually, we'll be full storm in our sense.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_00
 Um, we've got, uh, teletext outdated. Um, did you get any information on that?

0:02:55	SPEAKER_00
 Uh, we didn't, uh, right. And the corporate image was the, uh, final thing.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_00
 So, I got that in email form. Um, right. Okay.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_00
 So, I guess if we go ahead with the, uh, with the three presentations.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_00
 So, we'll start with yourself on the basis that, uh,

0:03:23	SPEAKER_02
 I'll just, um, I'll go up there. Sorry. Yep.

0:03:30	None
 Oh. Oh.

0:03:42	None
 Oh.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_03
 Oh.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_02
 Um, oh.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:04:58	None
 Okay.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. Um, let's go again.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_00
 Where's it going?

0:05:19	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. I'm going to be looking at the working design.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_02
 Um, I've just got three sections. First is the research I made on, uh, and the remote control itself. Um, and then I involves the components required in the, and the systems that design of the actual, uh, actual, um, So, having research, these existing models within the market, um, I've established what the components required for the remote control function, actually, are, and then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want to do and how it connects with the television.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_02
 Um, the basic components are an energy source, which I guess, um, in most of these models will be a battery supply, where that will be sort of two batteries for batteries, um, it may vary.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_02
 We then have the user interface, which is basically the, like, the, the bussens on the actual remote, um, the various functions is all changing channel, uh, channel up and down one, and then, um, there's also a chip inside the remote, which there's all the computer type things, and then a sender, which, um, is usually, I've found an infrared device, which sends a signal to the actual television.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_02
 Um, the last part is receiver, which is important in the system, there's not actually part of the remote itself, because that's obviously found in the television.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_02
 Um, and I've actually drawn the board, because it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this work, and so, let's go see there.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_02
 Do I have a class to wipe the stand with, or?

0:07:29	SPEAKER_00
 There's the rubber on the right, I think.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, we just have magic.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so we start off with a, um, batch, uh, no, a power supply, which probably, it's probably going to be the batch.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_02
 Um, we then have a particular button, which maybe, we know that it's obviously, there's lots and lots of different buttons, and this is how the basic system works.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_02
 Um, that sends, if it asks you press out a sensor message to the chip, which, um, then sends, it's sort of in turn, which by new press, then sends the appropriate message to the sender.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_02
 Um, so that's, um, that's the remote in the self, that's the components of the moan, hand, we're together.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_02
 So this is the user interface.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_02
 Um, this is the chip itself, which then sends the sender to us, the, that's the infrared, and then on the set, putting we have on the television, we have a, let's see there.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_02
 And the sender sends a message to the receiver.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_00
 So the, the top is the power source, yes.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yes, it's the power source.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_02
 Um, screwing on to personal preferences, as I've said, the batch, seems the best option for the actual mode, just because of the size you don't have a cable attached to the remote, otherwise it's not really remote.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_02
 Um, and then the sender, the infrared, um, has been used quite successfully, if the batch is on, reasonable power, they will seem to work for anyway.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_02
 They'll have to be pointed directly at the television itself.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_00
 So the battery is the, in the sender.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, and that's it for the moment.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:09:54	None
 Okay.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_00
 So, now more design.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_03
 Mine's not quite as complicated as it was last.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_00
 So, what would I do here?

0:10:14	SPEAKER_03
 Uh.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_00
 Control function.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_00
 Oh.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_03
 Um, there you go.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm going to talk a bit about the technical functions design.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_03
 And Louisa, the user interface designer, as you know.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_03
 Um, so the basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set, so that the desired function is performed.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_03
 Um, an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_03
 Uh, so obviously we need two different buttons for that.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_03
 Um, to change the channel, either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down, um, to switch the television on or off, maybe a standby button.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_03
 Um, here are two example of the notes.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_03
 Um, by the look of it, the both have, um, kind of play and fast forward rewind functions.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_03
 So I think the, in court, we're going to kind of video function, which we won't have to worry about.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_03
 Um, but as you can see, the left remote is quite, um, quite busy looking, quite complicated, um, where the right remote is much simpler.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_03
 It looks much more user friendly.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_03
 Um, so my personal preference would be the right remote.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_03
 So it's got nice big buttons, it's got a very limited number of buttons.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_03
 Um, the nice, kind of clearly labeled.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_03
 Um, I like the use of the kind of, um, symbols, like the triangles and the squares, and the arrows, as well as the words on the, um, kind of play functions and all that.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_03
 So it's very, very user friendly.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_03
 And it's got a little splash of colour.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_03
 Could maybe do a swore colour.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_00
 Um, well, there's a couple of things there.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_00
 Um, we have to remember that we have our own, um, nougal and colour scheme.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_00
 So basically we'd have to, uh, we'd have to be putting that on, um, the, the product.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_03
 Um, do we get to see that?

0:12:30	SPEAKER_00
 I haven't as yet.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_00
 But, uh, I got, uh, I got an email, uh, that basically said to, uh, make sure that, uh, whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate, um, the corporate colour and slogan.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_00
 So, uh, I'm guessing that, uh, I noticed on the bottom there has got, uh, what's that, ap, or, g, e, e, that might be the corporate colour scheme, although we only, we only colour I can see in that as the red.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_02
 Would you be able to get rid of the, the expense here, the sort of circular section, I'm starting to see for a video as well, we could dispense with that a little bit as well, and just get it down to just the numbers in the volume.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_02
 What's the basic section like, or a gap of this, yeah, just a little bit, is that, I think that's still in my video, yeah, and I'll pass from there, we could go with that as well.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and I don't really know, but, um, my numbers, I mean, how often do you use that, no, I think just one six and then channel up and down should be enough.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_00
 Well, the, the, well, for, for general television purposes, obviously you have channels one to five, at this point in time, and we'd have to have some room for, uh, future such channels.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_00
 So people used to see us, if we didn't have them, that might have been good.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_00
 Well, possibly, but the, the other thing is that with them, the current expansion of channels, and the process of taking place, certainly the button up and down, but, I mean, how many channels do we have to, actual television channels? Do we have to prepare for?

0:14:17	SPEAKER_00
 I would have thought that, uh, the thing is, forever expanding, and, in the moment we've got, although you've got the five standard, you've got the BBC have come up with a further six, and there's, I don't know exactly how many channels there are on, uh, when you take into account, uh, Sky and Vellia Souther, um, Vellia Souther, so I would have thought that we wouldn't, you know, rather than, okay, if the time of flicking from one to other, but presumably it'll take a second, because you have to be able to stop it, maybe you could have a fast forward on the, on the channels that, and then you could dispense with more otherwise.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_00
 You want, you want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_03
 Um, some remote tap kind of favourite options, where if you always flick from channel one to channel six, um, if that's a favourite, you just, like, bypass, to the five.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I suppose in essence you could have, um, if you've got a hundred channels, then if you had sort of an easy way of getting, rather than, I'd go one to a hundred, you could go one to, one to ten, ten to twenty, and then have a certain button to get you, to the actual channel you want, and that would cut down your tone.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_03
 You know me?

0:15:35	SPEAKER_03
 But I think a lot of them, like, keep on skydiving stuff, that'll be tuned into one channel, and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels, to get a fifty-five and the higher number.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_00
 Whatever.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, number to number of buttons, user friendly.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_03
 Fast forward nine is not really excessive.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_02
 As a Zoonanian, you've got the, the last one which makes a ten, it's like a multiple times you put them together so you can make any number.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_02
 So with that, we can bypass any poppers with.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that's true, yeah, you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever, that makes sense.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_02
 So that facilitates having all of them as good as any.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_00
 That's...

0:16:13	SPEAKER_00
 So what was the circular thing that you were...

0:16:16	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's just for a video, so we wouldn't need any battle.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_03
 So we can get a...

0:16:22	SPEAKER_00
 If it's just for TV, which is what it is at the moment.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_02
 So we get a hundred buttons that we got, it's got ten, eleven.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_02
 We got fourteen that we need, I guess.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_02
 Which isn't really too many, I'd be quite easy to make any of these guys for a four-week battle.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we've got...

0:16:42	SPEAKER_00
 There's remote for TV only, otherwise project.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_00
 We've become too complex with which we didn't danger the time to market.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_00
 It was one of the considerations, I don't know, did you have that information being the marketing?

0:16:57	SPEAKER_01
 Or was I meant to give you that information?

0:16:59	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure, I had some market information.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_01
 Right, no, from the company.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_00
 Right, okay, so basically time to market seems to be important.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_00
 Therefore, speed of delivery.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_00
 We've only got about another four hours left.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so is everyone happy with that?

0:17:19	SPEAKER_03
 I will ask that end of my presentation.

0:17:49	None
 I think it was going to happen too.

0:17:56	None
 Yeah, I think she said twenty seconds to...

0:18:01	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sure I'll have my ends to pay.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, let me go.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, there we go.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_01
 Right, we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_01
 And first of all, we should state that the remote controls were controlling the TV.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_01
 And how do people use it?

0:18:51	SPEAKER_01
 We ask them sort of which buttons were useful for them.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_01
 How does their remote control look and feel for them and what improvements would they like to remote control?

0:19:02	SPEAKER_01
 And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we prepared and asking them to fill in the answers.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_01
 And three quarters of them found that the remote controls were ugly.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_01
 And that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more or sort of a fancier remote control.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_01
 And that of all the buttons on the remote control, the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture and brightness and the audio settings.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_01
 They weren't used very often at all.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_01
 People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_01
 We also asked them about speech recognition for remote control.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_01
 And young people were quite receptive to this. But as soon as we got sort of over about into a 35 to 40 age, 45 age group and older, people were quite so keen on speech recognition.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_01
 There's a lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_01
 We also asked what frustrated people about remote controls.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_01
 And the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_01
 And they couldn't find it. And the second biggest frustration was that if they got a new remote control, it was difficult to learn all the buttons and all the functions and to find your way around it.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_01
 So the first one of the references from the marketing is that we need to call it some sort of sleek, sort of good looking, high tech, the design which looks high tech basically.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_01
 And that we should call it with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_01
 And we should sort of concentrate on the channels and the power and also volume.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_01
 And that's the thing, as Louisa said, we could maybe come up with a menu, sort of an LCD menu for other functions on the remote control, as worth thinking about.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_01
 And maybe we could think about speech recognition as well because so young people are perhaps the ones that are going to buy our new products if we aim it.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_01
 And so, you know, sort of a high tech design. That might be the market that we're looking for.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_01
 And we could maybe think about using speech recognition as always assigned to the control if it was lost in a room rather than sort of having it to just be recognition to change the channel.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_01
 Because there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise, so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channels.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_00
 Was that an last wee bit there?

0:21:54	SPEAKER_01
 About speech recognition. But that was only for young people that preferred that older people didn't...

0:22:09	SPEAKER_02
 So, you know, you know, you could have a remote control that you can't look to.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_02
 And then you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you can use that, you can ring it, maybe you can have some kind of sense, which is kept somewhere where you can just get a buzzer system between the two.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so you can pass a bell, which is always kept in one place and then it buzzes to you.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, some else. Where if there's no cashiness?

0:22:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we'd have to put two products together as well, which is...

0:22:52	SPEAKER_03
 So, that's what we saw back with something like that.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_02
 Sounds reasonable.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_02
 I guess it's an old task to the... or like the same technology could be put inside there.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_00
 Well, you're trying to avoid having a second product because obviously you could have a second product that gave you the wrong pitch, which we set the remote off to see here and sort of like, you know, without sound recognition.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_00
 But if you... I know, I'm just going to see a sharp noise, clapping of hand or whatever.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_00
 You want to try and just have the one product that...

0:23:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, if we can have it in the actual mode, everything in one...

0:23:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I don't know. I mean, obviously, if you've got voice recognition, then you can do it in that way because it will recognize the voice and you can give it a command, a set command, whatever that happened to be.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_00
 But you think of the point if you're not going with voice recognition then...

0:23:55	SPEAKER_02
 This is an option to turn it off or...

0:24:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_02
 So, I've always saw it with problems with the TV because it's because of the remote and the changing of sound.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_00
 So, any suggestion? Well, any conclusions?

0:24:13	SPEAKER_01
 Would it take quite a while to sort of develop this feature recognition software in the remote control?

0:24:20	SPEAKER_00
 If it does, then we can't. It's that simple because we've got three primary requisites from an email that was sent to me whereby we had...

0:24:36	SPEAKER_00
 The design logo was one, which we've already mentioned.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_00
 We've got... The remote was only for the television and not for... because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly. And the third thing was that tele-text, as far as the management is concerned, has become outdated due to the popularity of the internet.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_00
 So, that means that... So, these are the sort of three extra parameters that have been put on this project.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_00
 So, we're being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_00
 So, anything that is to be added such as voice recognition, etc. has to be very simple and has to be very quick because time to market is critical.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_02
 But, as we could guess something in which was quite quick and simple, I would give us an advantage of other modes.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_00
 It would, but probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras. Added extras would be nice.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_00
 But, the primary considerations to get the project finished within this short time window, which in fact, when now is sort of four hours.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_00
 So, and we're going to get to the end. I think first and foremost, we're going to get to the end and then get to the end with some added extras if possible.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. One screws this. So, I need to...

0:26:26	SPEAKER_00
 Right. So, I don't know how long we have left over time. But we have to make the decisions on the remote control functions and how we're planning to proceed so that at the next meeting each person that's got a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_00
 And also, when the next meeting is I... so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_00
 And then we can report back at the next meeting and say, right, okay, yes, we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this. This is how far we've progressed.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_00
 Does that make reasonable sense?

0:27:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_00
 So, we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote function so that you can decide what you're going to be doing.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_00
 And if between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting, if you get any additional information that only you have at that point in time, you think we'll be relevant to other people in terms of their decision making process then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_00
 Do it via the email so that rather than coming in on wood.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_00
 If you get the information just before the next meeting, that's fine. Come along with the next meeting, we can discuss it then and take whatever actions appropriate.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_00
 But if you get it well before the next meeting, let everybody else know because that might have an impact on what they come up with effectively at that next meeting.

0:28:10	None
 Okay.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_00
 All right, as I...

0:28:13	SPEAKER_01
 So, do we need to decide on the functions?

0:28:16	SPEAKER_00
 I would guess so.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_03
 I think it would be really easy, a big advantage if we did have some sort of kind of whistle-bath and kind of function.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_03
 Because I also kind of... the frustration of losing it.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that was the number one sort of frustration people said.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_01
 So, I don't think there's anything else on the market that does that.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_03
 I don't really know about the voice recognition thing.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we should concentrate just in the whistle-bath.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_00
 Something simple.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_00
 If the primary consideration is to get it there in time, time short, you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have it as a selling point for the product.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_00
 Something that's quick and simple.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_03
 And that won't be cut off the kind of older generation either because several good whistle-baths and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this, we tend to be too strong.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_00
 So, maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be on the basis that if we've got...

0:29:21	SPEAKER_00
 If we're catering to the whole age range, you want something that's easy to do.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_00
 You know, something that...

0:29:26	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I don't know.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if you think that more people can whistle than clap, then that's fine.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_00
 Then go for that option.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_00
 But if I would have put that more people could clap rather than whistle.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_00
 So, clap option.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_03
 We already decided that we don't need a teletext, but we haven't yet.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_00
 Effectively, that's what they're saying.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_00
 If people are now using the internet, then you don't need teletext.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_00
 So, take out teletext.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_02
 Can we decide on having the 10 numbers and then...

0:30:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, thanks.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_02
...and we'll get you next year, which can enable to put things down.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_01
 I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number.

0:30:19	None
 Yeah.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_01
 So, you can press any two and it all sort of put them together.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, 10 numbers and then some kind of device to...

0:30:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_02
 I'll put delay to...

0:30:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_02
 More for them.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_02
 More for future.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_02
 Do we decide anything about the other functions?

0:30:41	SPEAKER_02
 It's in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_02
 You had an idea about the menu?

0:30:48	SPEAKER_01
 We could possibly put it out there, sort of, the LCD menu in, but that again is probably an expense that...

0:30:56	SPEAKER_02
 We're just thinking people probably...

0:30:58	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, you don't have to put the two to the UE1s, but you have to be able to tune it that once.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_02
 So, in a TV break, you're only going to have to be able to tune it.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_02
 You can't really avoid that.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_02
 You decide when you dish the markets which do it by themselves.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_00
 But that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_00
 And if it is at the moment, that's fine, but at the moment it's not.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_00
 So, it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters, because otherwise it would make it...

0:31:27	SPEAKER_00
 Your device would become, you know, prouble or only operable in certain circumstances.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_00
 And the idea is to have an international market, which is...

0:31:36	SPEAKER_00
 And it's also...

0:31:38	SPEAKER_00
 The product we've got is something that's the...

0:31:41	SPEAKER_00
 I would have said the lower end of the cost scale, so we're not really going for something that's...

0:31:48	SPEAKER_00
 I suppose...

0:31:49	SPEAKER_01
 To have a high tick.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_01
 If people are buying remotes, then they're probably buying it through a place.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_01
 Another remote.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_01
 Possibly. Most tellies come with remotes.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older television.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_01
 So, we maybe need to keep the tuning functioning.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_02
 So, how does manufacturing work with you?

0:32:08	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe you have like one menu person, then you use the other buttons.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_02
 And then the buttons, to actually use that function.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_03
 That's a big good idea.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_03
 Because you do need a kind of brightness and contrast, everything as well.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_03
 My dad's watching the film the other week, when it was too dark.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_03
 So, I had to go through it to the right myself.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_02
 So, usually we're going to have the individual numbers, then the menu function, and maybe sort of slightly more advanced instruction booklets, with it to guide.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_02
 I think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_02
 Just stuff like the menu that you use, the different buttons, really have to have some better instructions.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's the way it.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure whether sort of having people have a booklet.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_01
 Because the second most annoying thing that people found was to learn.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_01
 The new one.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_01
 Right, okay.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_01
 So, maybe next to each of the buttons, each of them could have a number, and then also a function that next to it.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_01
 So, you're basically messing.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_02
 But that also goes back to the original design of sort of those two.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_02
 And it was all in the left hand side, which had a way to double function and stuff, which kind of looked too busy.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_02
 And I'm trying to show it, so.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_02
 Well, okay.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_03
 Well.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_03
 It's a bit sweet and sexy as well.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_03
 Have you seen the little portrait of kind of, um, that's a very good idea.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's so sad.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_02
 So, you keep, um, we've got five minutes before we wind up.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_00
 There's meetings, so I've been told.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if you've got the same.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_00
 I don't quite know.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_00
 So, so keep, um, keep detailed functions.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_00
 Um, hidden at the back.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_03
 And that would be better for all the generations as well, because.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_03
 Well, my dad doesn't like anybody kind of picture it, but it's pretty much read a button.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's a weird problem.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_02
 So, um, we're going to have to have to work out what's going to be on these other functions as well.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_02
 So, we're going to have like two separate.

0:34:10	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_02
 Two separate lists.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_00
 You do have functions hidden at back.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_00
 Can bring out when needed.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_01
 The detailed ones will be sort of brightness.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, that's right.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_00
 So, we're, this, so you've got which ones are going to be on the front?

0:34:27	SPEAKER_00
 Which ones are going to be at the back?

0:34:29	SPEAKER_02
 So, we have to decide.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_02
 Which one's the next couple of minutes?

0:34:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_00
 So, on the front.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_02
 The numbers.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_02
 And the volume.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, the volume.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_02
 If you have a mute button as well.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry?

0:34:49	SPEAKER_02
 A mute button as well.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_04
 Oh.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_01
 And it's probably power as well.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_03
 I don't really like, um, not an issue to me.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_03
 But, um, the whole thing about not using standby.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_03
 Uh, because of, uh, like, with electricity.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_03
 And it hasn't even been added.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_03
 Like, if you boil the kettle, that's for us.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_03
 Because it's standby.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_03
 It powers black door for us to get a lot of cash.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_03
 So, should we really try to discourage people from standby?

0:35:22	SPEAKER_02
 But then the minor biop thing haven't gone.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe two or two big issues for us.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_00
 So, so you're having to stand by on the front, then?

0:35:32	SPEAKER_03
 I think you probably should.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_03
 Well.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_02
 And we're going to have a channel up and down as well as a number of letters.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_01
 Um, because, yeah, the market research said there was quite a lot of people do just zap around.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_03
 Flicks.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_02
 So you've got 10, 10, 10, 10.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_02
 So, you've got 16.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_00
 Uh, channel down.

0:35:58	SPEAKER_00
 What else we got?

0:35:59	SPEAKER_00
 What was that?

0:36:00	SPEAKER_01
 Sixth number.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_01
 Volume is volume button.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_01
 How many volumes?

0:36:07	SPEAKER_01
 One up, one down.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_03
 On you.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_01
 That's 16.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_01
 Anything else?

0:36:15	SPEAKER_02
 Um, I don't think so.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_00
 Probably what I'm standing by.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_00
 Channel up and down.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_00
 So, is that it?

0:36:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, she's saying.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_00
 And it's 16 button, Jurek and.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_00
 And then in the back.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_01
 You've got brightness and contrast.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we're going to run out of time, one of Ishikmo, the list of these and then get back.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_02
 And the next meeting, just at the start.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_00
 So on the back.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_00
 I love brightness contrast.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_00
 Anything else?

0:36:51	SPEAKER_00
 You're also going to have the channel tuner in her.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_00
 How's it where?

0:36:55	SPEAKER_02
 She, uh, up and down.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_00
 Tuner with that.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_02
 I'm down.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_01
 And then maybe sort of an end to the button.

0:37:11	SPEAKER_01
 Sort of, you know, saying that you want that particular thing tuned in.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_01
 So you go up and down and then it.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah.

0:37:20	SPEAKER_01
 And then you want to just select.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_02
 I guess the keeping is important.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_02
 And the other one, you know, function, because it's just.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah, I would have.

0:37:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_03
 So I think there.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_03
 There's quite a lot of like doggies around.

0:37:42	SPEAKER_03
 So do you.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_03
 So there's sort of things.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:45	SPEAKER_02
 So they have their own controls on their actual products.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_02
 Or do you have to do a via the.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_03
 Um, I think we've got the whole country in this kind of like hidden panel.

0:37:55	SPEAKER_02
 As we've got the, I think, other own controls and we've been avoided.

0:37:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:00	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, no, I mean, um, like this kind of individual.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_03
 Like on TV.

0:38:06	SPEAKER_03
 But I don't know.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe unless.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe unless.

0:38:11	SPEAKER_00
 Well, you might get some research.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_02
 We should look into that.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_02
 And then.

0:38:19	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. Right.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_00
 So I'll do the minutes of this meeting.

0:38:24	SPEAKER_00
 And we'll meet back.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_00
 40 minutes.

0:38:30	SPEAKER_00
 I believe is the time.

0:38:34	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:36	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.
