0:00:00	SPEAKER_00
 reminds me ofwater for dove year Okay, welcome to the second meeting of this design group.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_00
 Briefly go through the notes of the last meeting.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_00
 We've just done in note form and I haven't attributed anything to individuals because we're working strictly as a team here.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_00
 We saw that the problems with existing remote controls were the boring shape and boring color.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_00
 We saw that what we needed to do was to make sure that you guys control several items.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_00
 Switching was easy but you shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_00
 That it needed to be controlled to make it interesting that the keys might be concave simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_00
 Interchangeable, spacious so people can personalize it, illuminate it so that people can see it in dark rooms, that people might want it in addition to their existing remote controls.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_00
 It should always work whenever you use it but it should be too small but it gets lost.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_00
 Now I'll shortly ask for three presentations.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_00
 Before I do that however I will go through some new project requirements that the management has placed on us and will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_00
 The management has had its own thoughts on this and they didn't necessarily agree with what we thought.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_00
 As a result of that we will then talk through the functions that we see the device actually coming out and we have 40 minutes to do this in.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_00
 The new requirements are that the management team see that the teletext is no longer of any importance given the device on the internet and they wanted only to cover televisions.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_00
 What is not quite clear from their directive is whether they didn't want it to cover teletext or whether they didn't want it to cover videos, DVDs, satellite boxes which we saw as being fundamental to the exercise.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_00
 The actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only on that basis.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_00
 I think we need to bear that in mind but possibly keep at the back of our minds.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_00
 The reality that people even with it no longer didn't look at teletext any more they certainly do look at other things.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_00
 The device has to incorporate the company logo and colors.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_00
 The logo being at the bottom of the screen there the two Rs in grey against the yellow background.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_00
 Now this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the market.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_00
 The other thing we have to do is to do some constraints as to how we might do that.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_00
 It also has to be simple which to some extent goes along with the first one and the way we've already said that it must be simple because that's what people want anyway.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_00
 We want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly which you see is their choice but we need to talk that through.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_00
 OK, so after meeting we'll be summarised and note sent out and etc.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_00
 OK, so we'll first of all have individual reports from everybody. Again there is no order of precedence here so I'll leave it up to you who thinks I'd like to go first.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_01
 I don't mind. I'm averse. I can steal the cable.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_01
 Cheers.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_00
 OK, so we'll start with the one that looks like a projection screen that I've got.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_01
 These are the functional requirements from there. Our guys don't have the research lab.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_01
 Take 100 people and cover all the aspects of what is needed by people and what they want to see.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_01
 Everything can from functionality and how individual functions are and how often they're used and which are necessary.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_01
 As we noticed, 5% of people find their remote controls ugly so some kind of a new style should be incorporated.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_01
 8% of people said they'd spend more money on it which is a plus for us if we can make it a bit better or cost effective.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_01
 We can put price up.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_01
 The remote controls do not match the operate behavior of the user. I can take that to mean as the only one from the television or as a live live.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_01
 We've got six remote controls for our stereo system, a digital box, a DVD player, a video player and TV.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_01
 We've matched well to my behavior. Again, 75% use the sample.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_01
 We've changed channels of volume settings. I think a big issue is 50% usually use 10% of the buttons.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_01
 Some of the functions like audio settings aren't hardly used and are not considered relevant by the user.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe fewer buttons which also make the design look sleager.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_01
 We've changed the illustrations of people losing the remote control.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_01
 We can use something else to find their remote control.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_01
 Time taking to learn new remote controls is to make it too complicated and easy to use for fresh time users.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_01
 We've also asked if people pay more for speech records.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_01
 We've also asked if people pay more for speech records.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_01
 We've also asked if people pay more for speech records.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_00
 We've also asked if people pay more for speech records.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_01
 We've also asked if people pay more for speech records.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_01
 We've also asked if people pay more for speech records.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_01
 We've also asked if people pay more for speech records.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_01
 We've also asked if people pay more for speech records.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_01
 We've also asked if people pay more for speech records.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_01
 We've also asked if people pay more for speech records.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_02
 We've also asked if people pay more for speech records.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_02
 We've also asked if people pay more for speech records.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_00
 We've asked if people pay more for speech records.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_00
 We've asked if people pay more for speech records.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_00
 We've asked if people pay more for speech records.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_00
 We've asked if people pay more for speech records.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_00
 We've asked if people pay more for speech records.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_00
 We've asked if people pay more for speech records.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_00
 We've asked if people pay more for speech records.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_00
 If we wanted something different, truly different, then the button must remake control.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_03
 Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't want to be bothered learning how to use new remote controls, if you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing, that's going to be quite a change.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_01
 But if you just lift it up and say channel 1, or even BC, you could even just have it left on, just put it down once on top of your TV and never have to.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, have it be kind of like the satellite box or the cable box and have it just go on the TV and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are, you won't lose it.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_00
 I can see technical problems with that in terms of the sound from the television, because if somebody actually on the television says, it's actually like that, I TV, only watching BBC, then it might change itself, so it probably needs to be possibly actually need a button on it, or it's too activated, or something just to identify that you've lifted it up on its use, and then just say, I don't know if it's all, and then, I mean that would certainly be truly different.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_00
 Because their audio settings not 0.8%, and if they weren't there, would people miss them?

0:16:05	SPEAKER_03
 But look at the importance of them, the volume settings.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_01
 Relates of 2 out of 10, yeah.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_00
 Volume, yes.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_03
 They're not used often, but they are quite important when they use it.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_00
 We need to identify things that people actually need, and it's a functional frequency and relevance, and I would say ignoring power for the moment.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_00
 The Chamblum volume, given that we've been told to ignore teletext, the Chamblum volume are the only ones that would appear to be essential.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_00
 So if we can design something that looks interesting, it all looks different, it incorporates the logo and the colors, and we can still have our interchangeable face, even if it's the yellow and grey.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_00
 Are there no buttons or buttons? There's an option.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_01
 I just thought I actually saw interrupt.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_01
 We're thinking about the technical problems of someone on the television saying a channel number, and we can maybe have an activation word, because I've seen a lot of computers before, which is addressed, or more to address, the computer, and then give it a command.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_00
 It depends on whether if you want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say, yeah, that's a PVC worm.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_00
 You could actually print it on the device itself.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_01
 I'm missing the point of view. You could still lose this.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_00
 That's always been a problem, I think.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_00
 I suppose one can make it so desirable that people lose it, they can buy another one.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway, sorry, carry on. I'll just carry on with...

0:18:21	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, I have. I have.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_00
 What's up to you?

0:18:23	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no, you have the option of the...

0:18:25	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_00
 In the middle of your report, so...

0:18:27	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I was just kind of wrapping up there. Yeah, I was thinking, yeah, you're such things that are relevant.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_01
 You can make things much more. I think the 80% of people with them are more on...

0:18:38	SPEAKER_01
...are more with it, looks better.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_01
 Combined with...

0:18:43	SPEAKER_01
...decreach the... or take out the limited functions that we don't really use much.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it's been... or ready to get to vertex, but...

0:18:52	SPEAKER_01
...as my channel settings and stuff, it might turn people somewhere to build some people that want the whole functionality away.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_01
 Since if we're marketing under a kind of fashionable approach, then...

0:19:04	SPEAKER_01
...it would be fashionable. Passionable of practicality.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_00
 Because we could make it dual-function, with our voice recognition and...

0:19:14	SPEAKER_00
...we still have buttons on it.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we could even have it as like...

0:19:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the buttons control this and the voice functions control the things that you would do all the time.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:19:24	SPEAKER_00
 Certainly could.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_00
 So, yeah, we could...

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
...power on and channel selection and...

0:19:30	SPEAKER_01
...climps selection. We didn't have to, really.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I mean, the advantage of doing the way the buttons all together is it makes them cheaper.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it probably would look better, as well.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it certainly...

0:19:39	SPEAKER_00
...but it's a possibility for making it visually very distinctive.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_00
 Because it does not have to be...

0:19:48	SPEAKER_00
...a oblong box...

0:19:50	SPEAKER_01
...lamed with a number of buttons.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_00
 Who...

0:19:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, that's definitely...

0:19:59	SPEAKER_00
...given that we bought the...

0:20:01	SPEAKER_00
...extensive discussion...

0:20:04	SPEAKER_00
...of the senses.

0:20:06	None
 Okay.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I could do mine.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_02
 Don't like it.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_02
 Let's see if I can...

0:20:14	SPEAKER_02
...make this work.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, you have to take, like, function and...

0:20:38	SPEAKER_03
...have something.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, athlete.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_02
 Is it doing...

0:20:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, give it a bit, 20 seconds.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:55	None
 Okay.

0:20:56	None
 Okay.

0:20:57	None
 Okay.

0:20:58	None
 Okay.

0:20:59	None
 Okay.

0:21:00	None
 Okay.

0:21:01	None
 Okay.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_02
 So this is just about the technical functions.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_02
 So the method I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of...

0:21:12	SPEAKER_02
...retrying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and...

0:21:16	SPEAKER_02
...identify what the necessary things are, what people are...

0:21:20	SPEAKER_02
...what you really want to have a remote control do.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_02
 And then there are two different kinds that I found.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_02
 There's a user-centered one and an engineering-centered one, which I will have pictures of.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_02
 And then we kind of have to decide which one this should be.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_02
 So these are the two...

0:21:39	SPEAKER_02
...different ones.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_02
 This one.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_02
 This is the user-centered.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_02
 It has quite a few...

0:21:45	SPEAKER_02
...fewer buttons.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_02
 And then this is the engineering-centered, which has a lot more buttons.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_02
 And probably this is one that people complain about about having too many buttons that you don't use.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_02
 So basically, what remote control is is you...

0:22:05	SPEAKER_02
...it's to send messages to the television set, you know, turn on, off, switch the channels and the volume and things such as that.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_02
 And so for this product, it's going to be television only and then it has to have the logos...

0:22:17	SPEAKER_02
...for the company and the colors.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_02
 And so for my personal preferences, I think this one is easier to use.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_02
 It has quite a, you know, fewer buttons.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_02
 We want something that sends messages easily to the television.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_02
 And I was kind of wondering about this example that they have...

0:22:37	SPEAKER_02
...it looks kind of narrow at the top.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_02
 And I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top, then that would be easier.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_02
 And so we have to decide what's going to make our product different.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_02
 The unique style, maybe have it light up.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_02
 It's visible in the dark, the changeable faceplates.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_02
 And the lighting up and visible, I was...

0:22:58	SPEAKER_02
...when we were talking about losing it, maybe to have a button on the television that you press.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe if it makes it in a ways or a life set for something like that.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_02
 So it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_02
 So that's my presentation.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_00
 Can I...I'm actually going to use the...

0:23:22	SPEAKER_00
...it's been of course great technical problems over here.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_00
 I'm actually going to use the...

0:23:28	None
...

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
...they probably clip.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_03
 They're not connected to anything on the table.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_03
 So I'll just leave one more ground.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_00
 It's rather than the traditional, in fact, I've got you to go that far.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_00
 Something like this shape.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_00
 So it's something that you can...a more vertical shape.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_00
 That you can sort of hold in your hand.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_00
 I think...

0:24:28	SPEAKER_00
...such as, I mean, so we hold it like that, possibly with a couple of buttons like that.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_00
 But with the entire top, with the infrared or whatever source.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_00
 So that it's flying up in all directions.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_00
 So that, again, the neat look at the technicalities of...

0:24:52	SPEAKER_00
...actually achieving that in terms of whether the power requirements of the...

0:24:58	SPEAKER_00
...such a source, you know, compromise the...

0:25:02	SPEAKER_00
...our need for, you know, it being...

0:25:06	SPEAKER_00
...permanently...

0:25:10	SPEAKER_00
...you know, available, whether different technology.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, all these remakes are presumably...

0:25:18	SPEAKER_00
...inforade, like they have been for a long time.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_00
 But we possibly need to be looking at something different.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_00
 You know, short range, not like the older radio remote controls.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_00
 We change next door to telly.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_00
 But I think basically if we're going to...

0:25:38	SPEAKER_00
...if minimum number of buttons is our priority, then we should...

0:25:42	SPEAKER_00
...it's going to say, we're going to really bite the bullets and reduce the buttons to...

0:25:47	SPEAKER_00
...ampsit minimum, you know, possibly we'll back up channel and volume buttons and...

0:25:52	SPEAKER_00
...on off, and nothing else.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_00
 So that it could...

0:25:59	SPEAKER_00
...unform a same dot like that, because again, except with some...

0:26:03	SPEAKER_00
...the wrist losing it.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway, okay, so Kate, what's your...

0:26:09	SPEAKER_00
...our help thoughts on this?

0:26:12	SPEAKER_02
 Which one's this plug into?

0:26:14	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's all...

0:26:16	SPEAKER_02
...there.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_03
 I can't...

0:26:46	SPEAKER_03
...did you see the most green?

0:26:48	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_02
 That's kind of...

0:26:52	SPEAKER_02
...that's not cool to rain.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, well, anyway.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_03
 Alright, yeah, so I'll just do my presentation on the working design.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_03
 There we go.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, just at the...

0:27:10	SPEAKER_03
...the whole method of how the remote control works.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_03
 The basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another system, the...

0:27:17	SPEAKER_03
...the TV or the DVD player or whatever.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_03
 It does this by what we need to start off with in the energy source.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_03
 And this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_03
 And the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages...

0:27:30	SPEAKER_03
...within the remote, which will then be sent to the...

0:27:34	SPEAKER_03
...the television, the DVD to tell what to do.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_03
 And you need a user interface, which controls the chip and thus the messages.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_03
 And the user interface is basically just the design of the actual remote...

0:27:46	SPEAKER_03
...what you'll hold in the hands and what buttons will be on it.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_02
 Shoot.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_03
 Just general findings.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_03
 What we need, technically speaking, for remote control is some sort of energy source.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_03
 Some sort of user interface, which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_03
 A circuit chip within that to control and send the messages and send her and receive her.

0:28:20	None
 And...

0:28:22	SPEAKER_03
 Oops.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_03
 It's just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_03
 This just kind of represents the energy source, which feeds into the circuit chip.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_03
 Which maybe then we could have that V into a switch, which would send signals to...

0:28:39	SPEAKER_03
...a subcomponent and onto a light bulb to light up once we start pressing buttons.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_03
 Also send signals to the infrared bulb, which will be the part that actually...

0:28:51	SPEAKER_03
...what?

0:28:52	SPEAKER_03
...send signals to the television and then you've got your happy little TV watcher there.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_03
 So my personal preference is, I just think we need sort of a big energy source that won't die out.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_03
 Perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place in so it would constantly be charged.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_03
 You wouldn't have to be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_03
 A wide range of sender receiver so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room and the channel will still be changed.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_03
 Also definitely a user-friendly interface.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_03
 And I think we've also mentioned adding a locating device on it, so when it does get stuck out of the couch cushions, as they inevitably do, you can find them easily.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_03
 And that's pretty much it.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_00
 It seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make before we...

0:29:50	SPEAKER_00
...you know, I think your point about the big energy source is a very valid one.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_00
 I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the die expectancy of the remote controls, particularly the independent ones.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_00
 Given the number of things you buy these days, we have a lithium whatever battery it that never needs to be placed in.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_00
 Perhaps we should have the disposable remote control of the battery relaxed, five, ten years, by which time...

0:30:33	SPEAKER_00
 I mean when all is set and done, digital television will be taken over in that time scale.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_00
 Perhaps we should have reduced the moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_03
 Just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years?

0:30:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, if anybody manages to run it down, then you can run it well.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_00
 Thanks, Anna.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_00
 It's what it saves in cost and you know, there's a...

0:31:02	SPEAKER_00
 Well, so they marked it and it started to get impacted, so it's very practical.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_00
 I think the idea of a rechargeable one is...

0:31:11	SPEAKER_00
...and I see a really high tech in it, it sort of just recharges itself if it's the buy, you know, magnetic waves or whatever.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_01
 It could have like a...

0:31:19	SPEAKER_01
...like cordless floor in your house.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_01
 It's like a base.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_00
 Since they're old, a lot of people are really going to use it.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, people would think that people might forget...

0:31:29	SPEAKER_02
...people forget to put their cordless phones back on there.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's... I mean, I know the promise, because my wife goes out in the morning and says I want you to put the phone numbers charged.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_00
 And then she's had those days so long when she doesn't look that pain by now.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_03
 I only remember to charge my cell phone when battery dies.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_03
 When it turns itself off, that's when I plug it in.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, right, so what we think about the...

0:31:59	SPEAKER_00
...the department is the battery.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_00
 That's pretty key to it.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_00
 We are really going for the ultimate in external simplicity here.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_00
 The cop costs in the manufacturing.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_00
 And, you know, they have a high tech in here, but then they will be cost effective.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_02
 Do they make batteries on that long?

0:32:25	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, certainly... I can't think of my head, but there are certainly things that you buy.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, calculators, for example.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_03
 They usually have the little light source.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think they're called...

0:32:39	SPEAKER_00
 They have the little solar.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, the little cells that...

0:32:41	SPEAKER_00
 Or something, I mean, the battery ones that are...

0:32:44	SPEAKER_00
...firmarily...

0:32:46	SPEAKER_00
...see, and in fact, I would...

0:32:48	SPEAKER_03
 Most of them don't, they have sort of a combination of the two.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_03
 Like, when there is light, they'll work off the light and then if they'll kick into this battery, so we can maybe do something like that, whereas there is a battery.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_03
 But if there's enough light, then it's using the light that's not actually draining the battery all the time.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_03
 But you will have the battery there for...

0:33:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it's going into the technology a bit.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, the actual time that a remote control is actually operating.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_00
 Our thing is...

0:33:15	SPEAKER_00
 It's probably...

0:33:16	SPEAKER_00
...no more than minutes in its entire life.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it depends who's using it, who's just sitting there clicking the phone.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, some people are getting the noise from it.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_00
 And they're clicking a lot, yeah.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_00
 That's what the wrong mouth is.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_01
 Like, this...

0:33:32	SPEAKER_01
...my research thing says, number of times per hour, that's used, channel selection 168.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_01
 per hour.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, per hour.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_02
 Wow!

0:33:43	SPEAKER_02
 It's a lot.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_00
 I want to know, I can just say that.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_00
 That does sound excessive.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_01
 But then again, if you think it might have, you know, meant the use, it's like, you know, that's less than a second.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that's right.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_00
 And I don't know what it is.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know what it is.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know what the signal is.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_00
 The signal is less as long as you keep the button pressed, or whether it's just a 10 to the second, no matter how impressive, or I don't know, I don't actually know.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_02
 But I think with digital TV, like I know on my cable box, you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_02
 If you just press it like that, so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the...

0:34:24	SPEAKER_02
...different channels that way instead of...

0:34:30	None
 Right.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_00
 So I've got my C-stage 5 minutes.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know how long does that appear.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_00
 Oh.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_00
 Where are we getting?

0:34:43	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_00
 So I'd need to sum up very quickly here.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_00
 We're looking at extreme simplicity.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_00
 We're looking at a radically different shape.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_00
 Possibly no buttons at all, but if you can incorporate channel change and volume buttons into the design, then that's fine.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_00
 Indeed, I mean, the role of the user interface, the designer becomes more involved here because, you know, shape is no longer a...

0:35:24	SPEAKER_00
...series constraint.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_00
 But we clearly only need the main buttons, although we clearly only need the main functions.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_00
 I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_00
 And the only buttons that I think we need are channel control, volume control, and on-off.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_00
 It needs to incorporate the portrait logo, the grey and yellow colour scheme, and there's no reason why we can't introduce interchangeable covers.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_00
 Does that accurately summarise what we've discussed?

0:36:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:36:21	SPEAKER_02
 I just have one question.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_02
 So are we doing just the television?

0:36:25	SPEAKER_02
 Are we doing...

0:36:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I'm doing just the television.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_02
 So not DVD.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_00
 But, okay.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's quite clear.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_00
 But maybe the information would be giving me the...

0:36:33	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_01
 That's the one.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_01
 And the constraints that you know what I got.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_01
 You know, I didn't even mention the text.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_00
 It's just a television.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_00
 That's one I sent to, which was mine too.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:36:49	SPEAKER_00
 I came there and sent head-off is...

0:36:56	SPEAKER_00
...that's...

0:36:57	SPEAKER_00
...that's there.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_00
 There we go.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_00
 So we can all give some thought to that.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_00
 But what will it make me think about?

0:37:07	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.
