0:00:00	SPEAKER_00
 Let's move on.

0:00:09	SPEAKER_00
 Let's go over there.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_00
 Welcome to the second meeting of this design group.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_00
 Briefly go through the last meeting.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_00
 Just in a form, and I haven't attributed any individuals because we're working strictly as a team here.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_00
 We saw that the problems with existing remote controls were the boring shape and boring colour.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_00
 We saw that what we needed to do was to make sure that the device controls several items, switching was easy.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_00
 You shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_00
 You need to be contoured to make it interesting. The keys might be concave, simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_00
 Interchangeable faces, so people can personalise it, illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_00
 People might want it in addition to their existing remote controls.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_00
 Use it, but it should be too small, but it gets lost.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_00
 I'll short the ask for three presentations.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_00
 Before I do that, however, I will go through some new project requirements that the management has placed on us.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_00
 We'll be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting. The management has had its own thoughts on this, but they didn't necessarily agree with what we thought.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_00
 We'll talk through the functions that we see the device carrying out.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_00
 The new requirements are that the management team see that the teletext is no longer of any importance given the device of the internet.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_00
 They want only to cover television.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_00
 What is not quite clear from their directives is whether they didn't want it to cover teletext or videos, DVDs, satellite boxes, which we saw as being fundamental to the exercise.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_00
 The actual wording of the directives should cover television only on that basis.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_00
 I think we need to bear that in mind, but possibly keep at the backs of our minds with the reality that people, even with it, no longer could teletext any more.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_00
 The device has to incorporate the company logo and colors.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_00
 The logo being at the bottom of the screen there, the two hours in gray against a yellow background.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_00
 Now this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the market.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_00
 The third thing we need to do is to do some constraints as to how we might do that.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_00
 It also has to be simple, which the somebody saying goes wrong with the first one, but the way we've already said that it must be simple because that's what people want anyway.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_00
 We also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly, which is our choice, but we need to talk that through.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_00
 The next thing we need to do is to summarize and note the same thing.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_00
 First of all, have individual reports from everybody. Again, there is no order of precedence here, so I'll leave it up to you to think so we'd like to go first.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_01
 I don't mind. I have a verse to move forward. Can I steal a kilo?

0:06:57	None
 I don't know.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_00
 How do I start?

0:07:33	SPEAKER_01
 This phone is turned off.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_01
 Everything can be from functionality and how individual functions are, how often they're used and they're necessary and so, in general, opinions about current and what's.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_01
 I see that as we can now know as 75% people find their own controls ugly.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_01
 So, some kind of new style should be incorporated.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_01
 Along with looking less likely, it looks better.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_01
 People said that people spend more money on it.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_01
 Which is a plus for us if we can make it look better and be more cost effective.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_01
 If we can put it price up.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_01
 Current walker tools do not match the operating behavior of the user.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_01
 I can take that to mean as they don't, the only work for the television or like, in my own way, I've got six remote controls for our stereo system, digital box, DVD player, video player and TV.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_01
 My behavior is to use multiple things at the same time.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_01
 I really matched well to my behavior.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_01
 Again, 75% is, 75% uses these Apple.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_01
 I think the big issue is that the user will use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume things.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_01
 I think a big issue is that the user only uses 10% of the buttons.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_01
 We've got a remote that makes it more like some buttons taken off by the like, a teletax.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_01
 Some of the functions like audio settings are not very relevant by the user.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe here buttons which also make the design look sliger.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_01
 And the frustration of people losing remote control is maybe some kind of system of press button on the TV or maybe that's something that's in the cockpit.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_01
 But some kind of system where you can use something else to find in remote control.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe like it would be for something.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_01
 The time taken to learn new remote controls is like you don't want to make it too complicated, easy to use for like first time users and stuff.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_01
 And the passive stream during, I suppose we speak more comfortable and make it possible even use, have to make it.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_01
 If you have buttons like you're just showing them the whole mice, the most idea of it.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe don't even have to hold it such. It must be some teletax out there.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_01
 It also asked if people would pay more for speech recorders and younger people say they would.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_01
 And there was another section on our report for LCD displays but the data wasn't there.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_01
 To actually know what the results were for that work. Maybe increment the layer meeting.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_00
 I can't say that the ARCA command box, but you know, if I was using the other day, but that had sort of speech recognition which worked remarkably well.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_00
 It could cut out the RSI as well.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_01
 So possibly this speech recognition was supposed to get into the design.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_01
 I've got some of the things I couldn't fit onto this presentation.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_01
 See this?

0:12:08	SPEAKER_01
 No, sorry, it's a bit of a thing. I'll read it.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_01
 Functionality, people's opinions on functionality, the relevance to the remote and how often they're used.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_01
 Using the switch, the switch on TV is a higher relevance of 9, but it's not frequently used.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_01
 We're as channel selection which is very high relevance is used the most.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe we can even start to cut down on, or I was supposed to even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe like a folding lid or something.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_01
 So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings which are lower relevance and rarely used.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 I keep the volume selection and channel selection very easily.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_02
 It could be, I'm just going to say maybe like the flip phones that they use.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_02
 Have you seen the new mobile phones that flip out and they have the texting and then the numbers on one side.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_02
 So you could have the most huge button on top and...

0:13:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, like the one that slides back in the button to see what's going on.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, sure. So we actually bite the bullet here.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_00
 If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all, just remove them, can we remove them all together?

0:13:31	SPEAKER_00
 That might be there.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_00
 We could actually have a remote control with...

0:13:41	SPEAKER_00
 I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_00
 Given that the...

0:13:51	SPEAKER_00
 Now the eight structure we were looking at.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_00
 I mean we had usage by eight structure of what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remote were in those particular age groups.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_00
 Do we know whether they...

0:14:11	SPEAKER_00
 45 to 55 age group to put myself right in the middle of it.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_00
 Usually remote controls to a great extent.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_01
 And this...

0:14:24	SPEAKER_01
 Pay more to speak directly.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_00
 So we're looking at...

0:14:29	SPEAKER_00
 And we don't know the relative proportion, the relative numbers in the age groups.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's true.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_00
 If we wanted something different, truly different, then the button must have made control.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_03
 Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't want to be bothered learning how to use new remote controls, if you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing, that's going to be quite a change.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_00
 But if you just lift it up and say channel one, or even BC,

0:15:00	SPEAKER_01
 I mean you could even just have it left on. You could just put it down once on top of your TV and never have to.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, have it be kind of like the satellite box or the cable box and have it just go on the TV.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_02
 And then it doesn't matter where in the room you are, you won't lose it.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_00
 I can see technical problems with that in terms of the other sound from the television.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_00
 Because if somebody actually on the television says, it's like an ITV, and you're watching BBC, then it might change itself.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_00
 So it probably needs to be possibly actually need a button on it, just to activate it, or something just to identify that you've lifted it up on its use.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_00
 And then just say, I don't know, I thought, and then, that would certainly be a truly different.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_00
 Because the audio settings are not 0.8%.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_00
 I mean if they weren't there, would people miss them?

0:16:04	SPEAKER_03
 But look at the importance of the volume settings.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_00
 Relatives of tier 10. Yes. They're not used often, but they are quite important when they use.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_00
 We need to identify things that people actually need, and it's a functional frequency and relevance.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_00
 I would say ignoring power for the moment.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_00
 The channel volume, given that we've been told to ignore teletext, and we've been told to ignore the volume of the only ones that stand out would appear to be essential.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_00
 So if we can design something that looks interesting, it all looks different.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_00
 Incorporates the logo, and then the colors.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_00
 And we can still have our interchangeable faces, even if it's the yellow and gray.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_00
 And there's no buttons or buttons. There's an option.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_01
 I just have a thought, actually, so I interrupt.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_01
 You're saying about a good technical problem of like someone on the television saying a channel number, and we can maybe have an activation word.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_01
 Because I've seen some computer issues before, which is you address the remote to your address, the computer,

0:17:33	SPEAKER_00
 and then give it a connect. It depends whether... If you want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room, and lift it up and say, oh, yeah, that's what you see.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, you could actually print it on the device itself.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just thinking of the point of view of...

0:17:58	SPEAKER_01
 You could still lose this remote.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_00
 That's always been a problem, I think.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_00
 And I suppose, well, I'm making it so desirable that people lose it.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_00
 They may be getting it and buying another one.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway, carry on with...

0:18:20	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, no, I have a drop to you.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no, you'll be absolutely...

0:18:24	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_01
 You can be the middle of your report, though.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I was just kind of wrapping up here. Yeah, I was in a game.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, you said things that are relevant.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_01
 You can make things much more...

0:18:35	SPEAKER_01
 I think the 80% of people that are more on remote to look better, combined with decrease the limited functions that we don't really use much.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_01
 Or we already take it to our text, but as in our channel settings and stuff, it might turn people away, some people that want the whole function on their way.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_01
 But since if we're marketing and working on a fashion-all approach, then it would be fashion-all over practicality.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_00
 Because as we could, we could make it dual function, putting our voice recognition on it.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_00
 We still have buttons on it.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we could even have it as like, yeah, the buttons control this and the voice functions control the things that you do all the time.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:19:24	SPEAKER_00
 Certainly good.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_01
 So, yeah, we could...

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
 The power-on and the channel selection and the climb selection, we'd have to really...

0:19:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I mean, the advantage of doing the way the buttons all together is it makes them cheaper.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, probably we'd look better as well.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it's certainly the possibility for making it visually very distinctive.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_00
 Because it does not have to be a oblong box,

0:19:50	SPEAKER_01
 lined with numbered buttons.

0:19:53	None
 Yeah. Okay.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry, have you...

0:19:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's happened.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_00
 Given that we've already had an extensive discussion, I think that's...

0:20:06	None
 Okay.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I can do mine.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_01
 Don't know, give me.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, let me see if I can...

0:20:13	SPEAKER_02
 I think this work.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, you have to hit like function and ask something.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah, it's...

0:20:39	SPEAKER_02
 Is it doing...

0:20:46	SPEAKER_01
 Give it a bit to say.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:20:52	None
 Okay.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so this is just about the technical functions.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_02
 So the method I looked online for examples of other similar products, and then just kind of...

0:21:11	SPEAKER_02
 We're trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and identify what the necessary things are, what people are, what you really want to have a remote control do.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_02
 And then there are two different kinds that I found.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_02
 There's a user-centered one and an engineering-centered one, which I will have pictures of, and then we kind of decide which one this should be.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_02
 So these are the two different ones.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_02
 This one.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_02
 This is the user-centered.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_02
 It has quite a few...

0:21:45	SPEAKER_02
 Fewer buttons.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_02
 And then this is the engineering-centered, which has a lot more buttons.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_02
 And probably this is one that people complain about about having too many buttons that you don't use.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_02
 So basically, what remote control is is you...

0:22:04	SPEAKER_02
 It's to send messages to the television set, you know, turn on off the switch channels and the volume and things such as that.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_02
 And so for this product, it's going to be television only, and then it has to have the logos for the company and the colors.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_02
 And so for my personal preferences, I think this one is easier to use, and it has quite a few fewer buttons.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_02
 We want something that sends messages to the television, and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_02
 It looks kind of narrow at the top, and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top, then that would be easier.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_02
 And so we have to decide what's going to make our product different.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_02
 The unique style, maybe have it light up, so it's visible in the dark, the changeable face plates.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_02
 And the lighting up and visible, when we were talking about losing it, maybe to have a button on the television that you present it, maybe if it makes a noise or a light stuff or something.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_02
 Like that, so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_02
 So that's my presentation.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_00
 Can I, I'm actually going to use the, of course, great technical forms over here.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_00
 I'm actually going to use the,

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 They're probably slip.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_03
 They're not connected to anything on the table, it's just to leave one more ground on them.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_00
 It's rather than the traditional, in fact, I don't know, you can give that far.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_00
 Something like this shape, you know, sort of something that you can, sort of, a more vertical shape, that you can sort of hold in your hands, I think, such as, I mean, somebody hold it like that, possibly with a couple of buttons like that, but with the entire top, with the, you know, the infrared or whatever source.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_00
 So that's, you know, it's flying off in all directions.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_00
 So that, again, the, the neat look at the, the technicalities of them, actually achieving that in terms of whether they know the power requirements of the, such a source, you know, compromise the, are, are needed for, you know, it being, permanently, you know, available, whether, whether different technology, I mean, all these remote, are presumably infrared, like they have been for a long time.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_00
 But we possibly need to be looking at, some indifference, you know, short range, not like the older radio remote controls, or you can change the next all-telling, or you can change the system.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_00
 But I think basically, if we're going to, if minimum number of buttons is our priority, then we should, let's say, they're really bite the buttons and reduce the buttons to, absolute minimum, they're possibly with backup, channel and volume buttons and on off.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_00
 And, and the else.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_00
 So, the, it could, it could, and form as end up, like that, it's again accepted, so, you know, there is to be losing it.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway, okay, so, okay, before I tell you all, or, thoughts on this.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_02
 Which one is this plug-in tick?

0:26:14	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's all, it's all there.

0:26:23	None
 I can't, did you guess?

0:26:30	None
 Could you see the mouse gray in there?

0:26:33	None
 Oh, yeah.

0:26:36	None
 That's kind of, that's not cool to win.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_03
 I think I'm going to have to, I think I'm going to have to,

0:26:50	SPEAKER_02
 that's kind of, that's not cool to win.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_03
 Oh well, anyways. Alright, yeah, so, I'll just do my presentation on the working design.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, just at the, you know, the household method of how the remote control works.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_03
 The basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another system, the TV or the DVD player or whatever.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_03
 And then it does this by, well, you need to start off the energy source.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_03
 And this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_03
 And the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages within the remote, which will then be sent to the, the television, the DVD to tell what to do.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_03
 And you use your interface, which controls the chip and thus the messages.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_03
 And the user interface is, that's basically just the design of the actual remote, which will hold hands and what buttons will be on it.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to shoot.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_03
 Alright, just general findings.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_03
 What we need, technically speaking, remote control is some sort of energy source, some sort of user interface, which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_03
 So, we're going to shoot a chip within that to control and send the messages and sender and receiver.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_03
 And it's just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_03
 This just kind of represents the energy source, which feeds into the circuit chip, which maybe then we can have that feed into a switch, which would send signals to a subcomponent and onto a light bulb, so light up once we start, once you start pressing buttons.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_03
 Also send signals to the infrared bulb, which will be the part that actually sends signals to the television.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_03
 And then you've got your happy little TV watcher there.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_03
 So, my personal preferences, I just think we need sort of big energy source that won't die out.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_03
 Perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or battery dock you can place it in, so it would constantly be charged.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_03
 You wouldn't have to be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_03
 A wide range of sender receiver, so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room and the channel will still be changed.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_03
 Also definitely a user friendly interface.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_03
 And I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a locating device on it.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_03
 So when it does get stuck out of the couch cushions as they inevitably do, you can find them easily.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_03
 And that's pretty much it.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_00
 Since the mid-air of the number of fundamental decisions to make people read, I think you'll point about the big energy source as a very valid one.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_00
 I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the direct expectancy of remote controls particularly, so they're depending on.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_00
 Given the number of things you buy these days, which are a lithium, whatever battery, that's never needs to be placed in.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_00
 Perhaps we should have the disposable remote control, no one's a typical usage.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_00
 The battery will last for five, ten years by which time, I mean when all set and done, the digital television will be taken over in that time scale.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_00
 Perhaps we should reduce the moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_03
 Just having one that's guaranteed to last for five to ten years.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, if anybody manages to run it down, then I'll do well.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_00
 It's what it saves in cost.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_00
 You know, there's a, well, so they mark it in gimmick and it's hardly a gimmick.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_00
 It's very practical.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_00
 So I think the idea of a rechargeable one is, I see a really high tech in it, so it just recharges itself with its environment and the magnetic waves,

0:31:17	SPEAKER_01
 it could have like a, like, cordless flowing in your house, it's like a beast that sends their old stuff.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, people are really going to use it, like.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, people think that people might forget, people forgot to put their cordless phones back on there, so.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's, I mean, sometimes my wife gives it to me and says, I want you to put the phone on the charge, and then she's at those with so long, which isn't worth that, I know.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_03
 So I only remember to charge my cell phone when battery dies.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_03
 When it turns itself off, that's when I plug it in.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so what do we think about the, the department, that's right.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_03
 That's a good idea.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_00
 That's pretty good, you see.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_00
 We are really going to be able to do an external simplicity here.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_00
 And they cut costs, but in the manufacturing, you know, they have a higher tech in here than the other, but they will be cost effective.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_02
 Do they make battery so much on them?

0:32:25	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, there's certainly, I can't think of anything to talk about.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_00
 Hey, but there are certainly things that you buy.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_00
 I'm a calculator, for example.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_03
 They usually have a little light source, I don't know.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_00
 They have a little solar.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, the little cells that...

0:32:40	SPEAKER_00
 Well, some, I mean, the battery ones that are, you know, certainly see the impact.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_03
 Most of them don't have sort of a combination of the two.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_03
 Like when there is light, they'll work off the light, and if there isn't, they'll kick into this battery.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_03
 So we can maybe do something like that, whereas there is a battery.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_03
 But if there's enough light, then it's using the light, so it's not actually draining the battery all the time.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_03
 But you will have the battery there for a minute.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and this needs going into the technology a bit.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_00
 And the actual time that a remote control is actually operating.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_00
 And what I think is, it's probably the normal, the minute, and it's entire life.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I think it depends who's using it,

0:33:22	SPEAKER_00
 who's just saying they're clicking, clicking, clicking. There's a bit of people getting the rest of it.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, they're clicking a lot, yeah.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_00
 That's what the wrong thing is.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_01
 Like this, this, Mark research thing says, is number of times per hour that's used, child selection 168.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_01
 That was per hour.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, per hour.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_02
 Wow.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_02
 That's a lot.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just going to use that.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_00
 I've missed that, that does sound excessive.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_01
 But then again, if you think it, if they might have, you know, might be used, it's like, you know, that's less than a second.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_00
 That's right. And I don't, I don't know what to do, but I know what the signal lasts as long as you keep the button pressed or whatever it's used to.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_00
 So 10 to the second in a matter of time, I'm impressive for that.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_00
 I don't actually know.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_02
 But I think with digital TV, like I know on my cable box, you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_02
 If you just press it like that, you're supposed to use the menu and go through there.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_02
 And then the channel's that way instead of.

0:34:32	None
 Right.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_00
 So I've got to say five minutes.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know how long it'll take.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_00
 Oh.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_00
 So I'd need to somewhat very quickly here.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_00
 We're looking at extreme simplicity.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_00
 We're looking at a radically different shape.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_00
 Possibly no buttons at all.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_00
 But if you can incorporate channel change and volume buttons into the design, then that's fine.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_00
 And the, I mean, the role of the user interface designer becomes more important here because no shape is no longer a serious constraint.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_00
 But we clearly only need the main buttons, although clearly only need the main functions.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_00
 I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_00
 And the only buttons that I think we need are channel control, volume control, and on off.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_00
 And it needs to incorporate the, the logo, the gray, yellow color scheme.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_00
 And there's no reason why we can't introduce interchangeable covers.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_00
 So does that accurately summarize what we've discussed?

0:36:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_02
 I just have one question.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_02
 So are we doing just the television?

0:36:24	SPEAKER_02
 Are we doing, so not DVD?

0:36:27	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's quite clear.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_00
 The information we've been giving away.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_01
 I can email the television only.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_01
 Quite necessarily one.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_01
 And the constraints, the email I got, do you imagine the title?

0:36:41	SPEAKER_00
 That's the last one I sent you, which was my turn.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:36:49	SPEAKER_00
 Some head office.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_00
 That's there.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_00
 There you go.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_00
 So we'll give some thoughts on that.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_00
 Or we'll make some thinking.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.
