0:00:30	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure if you're signed off a page.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_00
 I'll just kind of press the box and see what happens.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:01:15	None
 Okay.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to go to the concert.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_03
 Right. Well, from the last meeting, I was trying to send you the minutes, but it didn't work out too well.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe in sort of quick summary of the last meeting, I can quickly give you what we had.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_03
 So, right. So we had the fact that we're going to have the logo, the company logo in its color scheme, corporate it onto the device, the remote device. We had made our decisions about the device itself.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_03
 There's going to be simple to make it a complete project in time. We're going to have effectively two pages, the front page, which had the features that the customer's most wanted, and then the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements and the customers would have to look at them too often only as and when required.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_03
 So, so basically what decisions have we made?

0:03:49	SPEAKER_03
 Have there been any changes?

0:03:52	SPEAKER_02
 I think we all have a presentation again.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_02
 Three presentations.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_02
 I'll just go first.

0:04:12	None
 Okay.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_02
 So, basically, for the components design, the next step is basically the way the remote is going to work is still the same ideas before.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_02
 So, I still have the user interface, which is all the buttons we're going to incorporate.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_02
 Then there is a chip and still the sender.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_02
 So, yes, there's just a list of that. I think we're in the power supply as well.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_02
 I'll go on to my findings in each of these areas.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_02
 First in the power supply, we have the option of just the standard battery.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_02
 There's a dynamo. If you think of the old tortures which you wind up, like no idea.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_02
 There's a kinetic option, which then if you've seen those new watches which you power up by waving around, which requires a small amount of movement, which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_02
 That's one option, but I think that was going to cost a little more.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_02
 And then the solar cells, there's a final option.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_02
 For the buttons, we have an integrated push button, which is just to say all these are supplied by real reaction.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_02
 So, I guess for the ease of quickness needs, we should take them from at least one of these options.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_02
 So, if the button is an integrated push button, which I guess is just the same as the standard ones.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_02
 It says it's a similar to the button on the mouse for a normal, like one computer.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_02
 There's a scroll wheel, which is, you know, the new mouse is just going to be the center section, which you can scroll up and down, which may be for the volume.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_02
 Do that.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_02
 One issue for the buttons is depending on which material we use, if we use rubber buttons, then it requires a rubber case to have to go into consideration.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_02
 Moving on to the...

0:06:54	SPEAKER_02
 What would be the cost, do we know?

0:06:58	SPEAKER_02
 That's one.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_02
 I think there wasn't too much difference in the cost, but the relation to the actual buttons, but it does affect the printed circuit board, which is the next action.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_02
 Basically for the circuit board, which is the middle, let's just see it down there, the chips, and the workings of the actual remote.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_02
 The firm supplies a simple, irregular, and advanced sensor board, and there's different prices according to each.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_02
 So, if we got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons, that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard push button.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_02
 One final thing for the camera was some information on the speech recognition.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_02
 There's a small unit available through the company, which obviously would be an extra cost, but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_02
 I guess that would require a more advanced circuit board, so there is an extra price in that sense.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_02
 There isn't so much cost in that sense.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_02
 Going to my personal preferences, I thought possibly for power we could use Kinetto, which is the idea of the watches. You move the remote around to power that.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_02
 This would avoid batteries running out of home to replace batteries.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_02
 For the buttons, I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard push buttons, rather than the scroll wheel.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_02
 For the circuit board, again, it depends on which features we want in the actual remote.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_02
 If we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition, then we'd have to get a more costly circuit board.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_02
 That's it.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_03
 John, with the printed circuit board you were going for the...

0:08:56	SPEAKER_02
 It kind of depends. If we can have a speech recognition, we'd have to probably get an advance when I'm guessing.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_02
 But I don't know, as long as some people have a speech.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_02
 But are we going?

0:09:09	SPEAKER_03
 That's what decision follows.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_03
 So we're able to make that decision now, in a sense, that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue, so would it not be best to...

0:09:21	SPEAKER_03
 Rather than... I mean, one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_03
 The other way would be to do the presentation and then make decisions at that point in time.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_00
 And that's probably the better one to discuss it, it's great way.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_03
 Because at that point then you've got the details up there, so if we wanted to know, for instance, that the scroll wheel required the regular or what required advance, then if we were able to see that down and we could make the decision at that point in time and then that would be the end of that issue.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_03
 Does that make sense?

0:09:56	SPEAKER_00
 I have a lot of information there, it might not be very clear.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_00
 Unless you want to forget back in the years.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_02
 Good to you.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_02
 As I say, it only specified that we need a more advance or for the scroll wheel than the voice recognition came as a set of piece of information.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_03
 Now the scroll wheel required the regular, so that...

0:10:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, if you let down, it's just this bit of bond which I've highlighted, but the scroll requires a minimally regulated chip, which is in a higher price range.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_03
 The display requires an advance chip, the display required an advance chip, which in turn is more or less expensive.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_02
 And the lobby.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_02
 And the push button just requires a simple chip, so that would keep the price down.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and if we're going for a sticky, sexy, I think the scroll wheel is maybe a bit kind of bulky.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_00
 I've got some pictures, so I've seen pictures where they're kind of sticking off the side of it.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_02
 Simple push button and that would...

0:11:15	SPEAKER_03
 So, so we're going for...

0:11:17	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_03
 So, the answer word is...

0:11:23	SPEAKER_03
 So we're going for the simple one.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, simple push button.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_02
 We did everyone get this from the speech recognition.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_02
 There was basically what we said before, the idea that you were calling a set message and then it picks up our message and replies to.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_02
 So it is basically the concept we discussed before.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_02
 But then we don't know for sure whether it would require more complicated circuit or I guess it would have been like the definition of information.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we should go on with this.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_03
 So we go for the simple push button.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_03
 So effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_03
 Are we going for the regular?

0:12:10	SPEAKER_02
 If it's just a push button and it just needs a simple circuit.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_03
 But is there any other...

0:12:17	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, okay, that's true for the... for that element.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_03
 But we have to take all elements into consideration.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_03
 And so if there is one element that requires more expensive one or say the regular one or the more advanced, then that would have to be the same for all of them.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 I suppose I need really to find out what circuit board's that requires.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we probably need a decision.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_00
 But I'm going to put that.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't seem to send out a signal to the tele.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_00
 It's like a parrot just would reply.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_00
 It would reply in your message.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe that would be something separate.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_02
 So I don't think it would affect our circuit board.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so we'd have a simple circuit board and that would be extra.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_02
 That would be the bit.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_00
 And I don't think it could really perform any of the remote functions with this.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_00
 Because the example that we've given there is good morning coffee machine, good morning dual.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 It's useful to see like, where are you in the morning?

0:13:11	SPEAKER_00
 Here I am.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's maybe as far as that one could go.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that makes sense.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_02
 So we stick the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as next.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, just as a fun way to find it.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_03
 Simple circuit board.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_03
 Simple push button.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_03
 That seems like a good thing.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_03
 You were wanting to go for the kinetic person.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I thought so just for ease of moving to replace the batteries.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_03
 And how does it get charged up?

0:13:50	SPEAKER_02
 It's a thing that works on the basis to have some kind of ball bearings inside.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_02
 There's someone watches which you kind of shape to power that somehow the mechanism inside powers that to your movement.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so the speech recognition was, are we going for a speech recognition?

0:14:12	SPEAKER_03
 No, because that required the advanced.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_00
 I think it would be helpful to find it.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah, we decided to affect the circuit board just to the call.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_03
 I had speech recognition requires advanced.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_02
 I thought that's why I thought that maybe maybe doesn't know.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_03
 Speech recognition you reckon then is.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_03
 Is this a simple.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_03
 And so we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_03
 And that be.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_00
 So, that wouldn't really cost anymore would it.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, I don't think it really says anything about the cost, but it says it's already in the coffee machines.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_00
 So.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_00
 It's already.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_02
 I assume it would cost X a bit.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we'll find out how much that does cost.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_03
 And then after change.

0:15:23	None
 Change on everything at the last minute.

0:15:26	None
 Okay.

0:15:27	None
 Okay.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_00
 So, very brief presentation.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_00
 I haven't actually got the examples of this robot in there.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_00
 But there's some curve cases that you can see.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_00
 And the same just happened with the buttons.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_00
 It just seems to be skipping on with it.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I've found that.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_03
 And I need to try and get it back.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_02
 Have you right click and then go into it previously.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, sorry.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_00
 There wasn't much more to say about that.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_00
 Just round.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_00
 And some of the remotes that I looked at, one of the models that did actually have voice recognition where you could.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_00
 Where it was connected to the remote control functions.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_00
 And it was quite a swish model where it can control four devices to be the satellite video, editing, audio.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_00
 So that's a bit of competition there.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_00
 So.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_00
 And just to market it as a completely different, like different view pointers, the kind of finally lost control rather than trying to compete with the platform.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_00
 The scroll buttons as I already mentioned them.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_00
 And those examples of those were the don't look as sleek as other models.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_00
 And there's no real advantage.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_00
 And because it impacts on the materials in the price, it's not great.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_03
 So you're saying the scroll buttons.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_00
 There was a specialist type of report that we could think about.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_00
 There was children's remote where they just had a very limited range of buttons in the world, bright and colorful.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_00
 And you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_00
 But I don't know if that's really in our field.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_02
 I guess we're going to the biggest market and maybe not.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_02
 Was it specified that we went to the biggest?

0:17:38	SPEAKER_03
 Or to go for the international market rather than a local market, but that wouldn't necessarily preclude.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_03
 There's one thing that you can often do with products is you can make small modifications.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_03
 You have your basic model, which you would sell at, whatever.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_03
 And then you could have additional features in, you know, like a model one model two and model three.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_03
 And therefore you can subdivide your market up, but that's really more in your fields.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe the children most would like an ex-step, maybe.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_02
 Or you could add on for an extra package.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_03
 But on this basic one, I'm writing that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that you would have for future reference, the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_03
 So what are we deciding to do here?

0:18:38	SPEAKER_00
 I think because it's already a very good voice recognition technology out there.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_00
 Because ours might not cover the same functions that the movie fans do.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_00
 It might be a good idea to market it as a finder function.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe older people might not like the speech recognition.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_00
 Oh yeah.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_02
 So if it's the languages, they might not be compatible.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_02
 It would make it quite complicated.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_02
 Whereas this keeps it very simple.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because I think you program this one yourself, like to see whatever you want to your question.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that was a cheap device.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know how much we'll be able to put into it.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_03
 So you have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature in your talk.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_03
 That's something else comes up.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_03
 And you're talking about scroll buttons.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think we've decided that it's going to increase the cost and give real real attention to the benefit.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_00
 And it's going to decrease from the sleepless order.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_03
 All right, so we're just going to have the rubber button.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_00
 And just to be aware that the archivist specialist functions and specialist remote will probably don't want to focus on those.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so not to be focused on.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_00
 Just to avoid ambiguity.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_00
 So I gave the example of say your volume buttons, but up and down.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_00
 They might both have a V on for volume.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_00
 I think I did this.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_03
 Good. In flip it round at 90 degrees, 180 degrees and have it up and down.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_03
 And upside down V.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_03
 So that would show that volume was going up.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_03
 Whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_00
 I think the thing was that if you decide to do this to have triangular buttons, somebody might look at this one and see all this triangular button is pointing up.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_00
 And that's the first thing that the C.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_00
 No, I think.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, no, they might see.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, they might see this pointing down.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_00
 I think right, that's going to turn the volume down.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_00
 Whereas the actual button is pointing up.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_00
 So the function is to turn the button up.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_00
 So be careful what you put on the buttons and be careful of the shape that you make them because it might be kind of two contradicted shapes.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe we have volume written on the side, then up and down on the button.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_03
 You can have volume up and volume.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_03
 Volume up down.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_03
 And because the idea was to have limited, it was to have sizable amount of information on it.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_03
 Limited number of buttons.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_03
 Because it was 16 buttons, wasn't it?

0:21:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we were going down to that.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_00
 And I think that's all I had to see before that.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_00
 So what was the decision on the design of the volume button?

0:22:04	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to go through the design of all the buttons at the moment.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_01
 I've got some things to say about possible design.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm going to turn the volume down the direction.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm going to turn the volume down the direction.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to turn the volume down the direction.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_01
 about remote controls and what was good about them, what was bad, what they used.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_01
 And we've also been looking at sort of fashion, what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment. So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching via fashion trends.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_03
 You know, go to yourself.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_01
 So just to summarize, the most important thing is you just came out of the remote control market investigation.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_01
 The most important thing was that the things sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_01
 And second, there should be some technological innovation.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_01
 And then third, and less important than the other two, that there should be an ease of use as well.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_01
 And apparently the fashion trends are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with fruit and vegetables.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_01
 But the feel of the material should be spongy, which is country to last year apparently.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_01
 And presumably not spongy last year.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_01
 So we need to emphasize the fancy design on our remote control above all else.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_01
 And then also try and add in technological innovation, which could be sort of find a thing with a hand clap.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_01
 And then we need to make it easy to use as a third priority.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_01
 So perhaps a few buttons and functions as we've discussed.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_01
 And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg, or the buttons could be spongy somehow.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_01
 And then sort of even wacky than that, we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote, say in the shape of a banana or something like that.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_01
 Right, so maybe a banana or a courgette or something.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_01
 So how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends, do you think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget or do they not matter that much?

0:25:12	SPEAKER_00
 I think if you start making the buttons fruit shift, it might make it more complicated to use.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you were just talking about you've got to be careful about how you shape your buttons because you're going to miss direct people.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_03
 And I would have thought the functionality because the people get cheesed off by having to read instructions, etc.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe just one button, say the standby button is quite kind of separate from all the other functions.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe that could be a little apple.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_00
 And I wouldn't get in the way of like kind of one with nine and it wouldn't cost you numbers.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, standby button.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_03
 No, that incorporates the trend, both at the same time not confusing people.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_03
 If you're looking for functionality.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_02
 I guess maybe through a vegetable, maybe pop in the loam, but that's going to be next year.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_03
 But okay, but you can incorporate that.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_03
 If you change all the buttons, then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg next year's, I was going to say animals are elephants or whatever.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_03
 That means you're constantly changing your production schedule and you've got to make different molds and everything else.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_03
 So that's not a good idea. I would suggest.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_01
 What the time scale with selling the product over it.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, the scene is realistic. The remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes those kinds of fashion.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_02
 So it keeps us something which is maybe more universal.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_00
 Well, as long as it's quite a subtle design.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_02
 Even if it's a design, you can apply it.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_02
 The spongy feels.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_03
 Well, yeah.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe saw the rubber design.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_03
 Was that in the sort of fashion sense that this or was the spongy feel was that sort of fashion it was, wasn't it?

0:27:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_00
 So, the...

0:27:02	SPEAKER_00
 It's like you're going to have rubber cases as well as buttons.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_00
 And like you can make them curved or double curved.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_00
 That would be the kind of thing.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_02
 One of the things that if you had rubber buttons and you had to have rubber case.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, no, no, no.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_02
 So it's if you use a rubber double curved case and you must use rubber buttons.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_02
 That's the way I'm doing.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_02
 You have the rubber case and you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_02
 Sure.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_02
 Thanks.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_02
 Thanks.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_03
 Remember buttons require rubber case.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_00
 I know.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_03
 The main problem is how frequently do the fashions change.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_03
 Because in essence in the production you want things to stay.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_03
 You want to basically mint them out.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_03
 Because if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating, then it means that your stock is, you know, last year's stock and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate, which you wouldn't want to do.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_03
 Whereas if you kept the product the same, but you could have a difference from year to year.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_03
 It seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like, rather than changing the whole, getting caboodle, you're just changing one aspect like this down by button or something like that.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_03
 And especially because then you could make it something that.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_02
 So, you might be limited if I were to slasper the logo on the edge.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you might be limited in space.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you two are obviously going to find out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modeling stage as to how much, how much, how much, how pliable is plasticine.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_02
 Moving the cases like changing the fashions like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_02
 Like, whether that would be too much to incorporate into that.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_02
 Whether that would just make it more complicated.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_03
 So, you're talking about changing the casing.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the actual sort of look from the outside.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_02
 So, the buttons would stay the same.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_02
 And the general function of the remote would stay the same, but then you could change the way it would.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and then you could have, or but you still would have to have the logo on every nucleus.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but you could have like pinky since for the old ones.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you could do a color change.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_03
 So, therefore you would, yeah, yeah.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, that's effectively what they do with the mobile phones, which is to have some in blue, some in red, some in red, rather than all in black or, you know, which four do you want as long as it's black.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_03
 So, so...

0:29:41	SPEAKER_02
 So, it's most dirty.

0:29:43	None
 We are supposed to use the, um, Comprom, color, or how many?

0:29:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, oh, that's true.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I don't know.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, what do you both put in my classroom?

0:29:53	SPEAKER_03
 Well, not necessarily because you could have your company, or might be finishing up.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_03
 You could have your company badge.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, a lot of computers, for instance, like, like on the one you've got there.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_03
 It actually has a sort of stick on badge.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_03
 So, what you would all, all you would really need, whether, you know, whether the casing be any color, could be any color.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_03
 And that badge would then have to stick out on top of it, so that, in a sense, with a, with a logo like that, because it's on a white background, the only color that it might not stick out somewhere well on would be a white casing.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_03
 Because you, you know, you're sort of, you're badging it.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_03
 In fact, a lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them themselves with their own badge over the top.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_03
 And in fact, the way they've got that there, even if you had that on a white, which is the predominant color of the, the windows badge, you'd still be able to see it clearly from, you know, a white casing product.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_03
 So,

0:30:57	SPEAKER_00
 we'd have a big in the market to have this kind of like secondary market selling the cases.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_01
 People say that it's the look, the fancy look of the in-bounds. Yeah, I'm not convinced on whether having change book covers would be something that people buy into. I think with the mobiles, it's the, you know, it's a communication device. People see you with it all about.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I suppose we're a bit of a cute little motor.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_01
 It's in the house, isn't it? Yes, it was.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so if we just went for one color, so don't change case, change case color and we're sort of saying no to that.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_01
 Do we decide on the other case? The sponge you feel I did, I think that might go as a trend. Well, it was different last year, the trend was different last year, apparently, it was not, not the sponge you feel, but I don't know whether the trends have changed. I don't know whether it's from those things that, like, sort of having all group shaped keys that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly. Yeah, just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less, less or less in my own sense.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_01
 You're going to end up hating it a year.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_03
 If you're going for fashion trends like that, you'd have to have interchangeable cases so that you could, or because otherwise someone's going to have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_02
 This seems to make sense if we just make a stick with the standard rubber case and then have the standard rubber buttons as well. Okay.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_02
 Well, haven't we talked about the curvature of the case? This flat, the single curve, and this double curve? I'm not exactly sure what it looks like.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe kids give it a funny more aesthetic deal with a double curve when requires to perform miracles for the class.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's a tough one.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_01
 When you say, when you say double curve, what exactly does that mean?

0:33:05	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not exactly sure. I'll show you the motor. See how the one, I'm not familiar with that.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_03
 One thing to consider is that in some ways you want, by having a fairly standard case, it means they can all fit together on top of each other.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_03
 Therefore, for storage purposes and shops and the like, it makes it easier if you can store them on top of each other.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_03
 Whereas if you do fancy things, whether you then got to put it in a packaging box that does that.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_03
 And the cost of packaging could be quite important vis-a-vis the total cost of the product.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_02
 So, I think quickly and just work out what we decided on the way after.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_03
 So, but...

0:34:00	SPEAKER_00
 It's not very clear up there, but it's not a similar kind of bulges, except one and the end.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_00
 When it's a curve there. I don't know if a double curve is maybe a comes up slightly.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sorry, I don't worry, Kerve.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_03
 So, do you want to go for curves, more curves?

0:34:22	SPEAKER_03
 We're meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_00
 We'll go for single curves, just to call it minus.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, curved or double curve, so it's a single curve.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_02
 So, did we decide on the kinetic power supply?

0:34:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think we're going to go for simple stuff before just to keep the cost down.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_02
 I think we can't buy not having anything to complicate.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and the voice recognition, we're going to use that car, we're just to find it.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, sure.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_02
 We could always decide against this if something comes up.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_02
 That's just something to move out.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_01
 And then we're going for sort of one button, which is like a group.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's nice.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_00
 You wouldn't do too much harm in a couple of years.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_03
 So, we've got spongy feel buttons as well, have we?

0:35:39	SPEAKER_03
 Or was that rubber buttons?

0:35:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so it's rubber buttons, so it's not really spongy feel buttons, it's just rubber buttons.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's a rubber case.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_03
 And the standby button is going to be different.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_00
 So, what shape are we making the standby button?

0:36:02	SPEAKER_03
 Apple.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_03
 Apple.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, sorry.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_00
 We'll give it a little bit of a...

0:36:08	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's quite a big one as well.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, it could be red.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_01
 Can we red apple?

0:36:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_01
 A red apple?

0:36:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because...

0:36:22	SPEAKER_00
 I want to incorporate a bit of colour if we can.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_00
 Once we find out.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and then we're going to...

0:36:27	SPEAKER_02
 You're going to work on keeping the buttons like, quite simple.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_02
 Just like the...

0:36:32	SPEAKER_02
 Just working out what we're going to do for the next time.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that seems pretty straightforward.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_00
 Because most of them will just be kind of...

0:36:44	SPEAKER_00
 mainly circular, or very pleased.

0:36:49	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_03
 So, what was that last thing in there?

0:36:55	SPEAKER_00
 Just to keep the shape of the button is simple.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_03
 Right, well, you have much option on that.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_03
 I thought you were going for a single curve and...

0:37:04	SPEAKER_00
 Just the shape of the buttons?

0:37:07	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, just keeping the sort of the label and the labeling of them.

0:37:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_02
 And sort of the size.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_03
 All right, so the shape of buttons is simple.

0:37:20	None
 Okay.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_03
 So, that's it, I guess.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_03
 You should now go away and get these things sorted out.

0:37:34	SPEAKER_03
 I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:37:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.
