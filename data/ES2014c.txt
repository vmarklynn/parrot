0:02:08	SPEAKER_03
 Right, well, from the last meeting, I was trying to send you the minutes, but it didn't work out too well.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_03
 So, maybe in sort of a quick summary of the last meeting, I can quickly give you what we had.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_03
 Right, so...

0:02:44	SPEAKER_03
 I should have had a close look at that.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_03
 Right, so we had the fact that we're going to have the level, the company level in its color scheme, cooperated on to the device, that I want device.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_03
 We had made our decisions about...

0:03:01	SPEAKER_03
 made our decisions about the device itself that was going to be simple to make it a little less complete project in time.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_03
 We're going to have effectively two pages, a front page, which had the features that the customers wanted, and then the backup features on the second page, so that it would meet the technical requirements and the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often, only as and when required.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_03
 So, basically what decisions have we made?

0:03:48	SPEAKER_03
 Have there been any changes?

0:03:51	SPEAKER_02
 I think we all have a presentation again, so we'll go ahead and give those.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_02
 Three presentations, yes.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_03
 So, to go physical.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yep, fine.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_02
 I'll see if it's a little more smooth in the last one.

0:04:32	None
 Okay, let's go.

0:04:34	None
 Basically, before the components design, the way the remote is going to work is the same idea as before.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_02
 We still have the user interface, which is all the buttons we're going to incorporate.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_02
 Then there is a chip and still a sender.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_02
 So, yes, there's just this and that.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_02
 I think we've been the power supply as well.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_02
 I'll go into my findings in each of these areas.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_02
 First in the power supply, we have the option of just the standard battery.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_02
 There's a dynamo.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_02
 If you think of the old torches, which you wind up, there's a kinetic option, which is if you've seen those new watches, which you power up by waving around.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_02
 It just requires a small amount of movement.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_02
 Which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_02
 That's one option, but I was going to cast a little more.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_02
 Then the solar cells, there's a final option.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_02
 For the buttons, we have an integrated push button.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_02
 Just to say all these are supplied by real reaction.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_02
 So, I guess for the ease of quickness needs, we should take them from at least one of these options.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_02
 So, for the buttons, there's an integrated push button.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_02
 I guess it's just the same as the stand ones.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_02
 It says it's similar to the button and mouse for normal, for like modern computer.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_02
 There's a scroll wheel, which is, you know, the new mouse, which is called the Santa section, which you can scroll up and down, which may be for the volume.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_02
 Do that.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_02
 One issue for the buttons is, depending on which material we use, if we use rubber buttons, then it requires a rubber case.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_02
 That's where we have to go into consideration.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_02
 Moving on to the...

0:06:54	SPEAKER_02
 What would be the cost to do, do we know?

0:06:57	SPEAKER_02
 That's on the neck.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_02
 I think there wasn't too much difference in the cost, but the relatively actual buttons, but it does affect the printer's circuit board.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_02
 Which is an excitation.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_02
 Basically for the circuit board, which is the middle, let's just see it down there for chips, like the workings of the actual remote.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_02
 The firm supplies a simple, irregular, and advanced circuit board.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_02
 And there's different prices according to each.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_02
 So if we've got a scroll wheel for one of the buttons, that would require us slightly more advanced circuit board, and if we just had a standard push button.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_02
 One final thing for camera for some information on the speech recognition, there's a small unit available through the company, which obviously would be an extra cost, but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_02
 And I guess that would require more advanced circuit boards.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_02
 There is an extra price in that sense.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_02
 There isn't so many extra costs in that sense.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to my personal preferences.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_02
 I thought it was possible for power we could use kinetic, which is the idea of the watches.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_02
 You move the remote around to power that.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_02
 And this would avoid the batches running out, having to replace batches and such.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_02
 For the buttons, I thought we'd probably get away just having the standard push buttons, rather than the scroll wheel.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_02
 And for the circuit board, again depends on which features we want in the actual, in your note.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_02
 So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition, then we'd have to get a more costly circuit board.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_02
 So with the circuit board you were going for the...

0:08:48	None
 It kind of depends.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_03
 If we're going to have a speech recognition, we'd have to probably get an advanced one and guessing.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_02
 But I don't know, so that was something we'd have to do.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_02
 But are we going for that?

0:09:00	SPEAKER_02
 That's the worst decision for us.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_02
 So we will do that.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_03
 So we will make that decision now, in a sense, that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_03
 So we're not be best to...

0:09:20	SPEAKER_03
 Rather than, I mean, one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations, as they were, the other way would be to do the presentation and then make the decision at that point in time.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_00
 You have probably better ones, you're discussing it straight away.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_03
 Because at that point in, you've got the details up there.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_03
 So if we wanted to know, for instance, that the scroll wheel required the regular or what required advance, then if we were able to see that down and we could make the decision at that point in time, and then that would be the end of that issue.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_00
 Does that make sense?

0:09:56	SPEAKER_00
 I have a lot of information there, so I might not be very clear.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_00
 Unless you want to forget back in the years.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_02
 Pretty, yeah.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_02
 As I say, it only specified that we need more advance, or for the scroll wheel, and the voice recognition came as a piece of information.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_02
 Now the scroll wheel required the regular, so that...

0:10:32	SPEAKER_02
 Just a bit of a long way, if I like to, but the scroll requires a minimum likelihood chip, which is in a higher price range.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_03
 The display requires an advance chip, the display required an advance chip,

0:10:46	SPEAKER_02
 which in turn is more expensive.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_02
 So we can now do that push-button and just require the simple chip, so that we can get the price down.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, the progress of the click and sexy, I think the scroll wheel is maybe a bit kind of bulky. I've got the pictures, so I've seen the pictures, we have the sticker off the side of it.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_03
 So we're going for...

0:11:17	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_03
 So, transfer word is...

0:11:30	SPEAKER_01
 So we go for the simple one, or...

0:11:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, simple push-button.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_02
 We did everyone get this from the speech recognition.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_02
 There was basically what we said before, the idea that you were calling a sad message and then it picks up a message and it applies to you.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_02
 So it is basically the concept we discussed before.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_02
 But then we don't know for sure whether it would require more complicated circuit, or I guess it would, then I forgot the definite information.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we should go more with this, rather than...

0:12:01	SPEAKER_03
 So we go for the simple push-button.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_03
 So effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_03
 How are we going for the regular?

0:12:09	SPEAKER_02
 If it's just a patch button, then it just needs the simple circuit.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_03
 But is there any other...

0:12:17	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, okay, that's true for that element.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_03
 But we have to take all of them into consideration.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_03
 And so if there is one element that requires more expensive one, or say the regular one, or the more advanced, then that would have to be the same for all of them.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 So I suppose we need to find out what circuit boards back requires, maybe we should really do this.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_00
 But we're not allowed to put that.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't seem to send out a signal to the tele, it's like a parent just reply in your message.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe that would be something, so I don't think it would affect our circuit.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so we have a simple circuit board and that would be an extra, that would be the decision.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_00
 And I don't think you could really perform any of the more functions with this.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_00
 Because the example that they've given me is good morning coffee machine, good morning dual.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_00
 And I'd be useful to see like, where are you in the mood?

0:13:11	SPEAKER_00
 Here I am.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's maybe as far as that one.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_00
 Could go.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that makes sense.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_02
 So we stick the simple circuit board and then think the speech recognition is nice, too.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, just as if I'm waiting to find it.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_03
 Simple circuit board, simple push button.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_03
 Can you, you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply?

0:13:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I thought so just for, just for ease of loving to replace the batteries.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_03
 And how does it get charged up?

0:13:50	SPEAKER_02
 I think it works on the basis they have some kind of ball bearings inside.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_02
 There's someone watching this which you kind of, you shape to power that.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_02
 Somehow the mechanism inside, the power's out for your movement.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_02
 So you use the metal and then that powers out to ease it.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_03
 So the speech recognition was, are we going for a speech recognition?

0:14:11	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_03
 Was that required the advanced?

0:14:14	SPEAKER_00
 I think it would be helpful to find it.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think it.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_02
 Which I didn't affect the circuit board, just to find it.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_02
 Just to the core.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_03
 I had speech recognition requires an advanced work.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_02
 Although that's where I thought, but maybe it doesn't know.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_02
 Oh.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_03
 Speech recognition, you reckon then is, is just an efficient thing.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_03
 It's simple.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_03
 And so we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_03
 And that be.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, shall I pass it in here?

0:14:52	SPEAKER_03
 That wouldn't really cost any more, would it?

0:14:55	SPEAKER_00
 Just check what it says.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, I don't think it really says anything about the cost, but it says it's already in the coffee machines.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_00
 So I get already.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_02
 I see me with the cost, thanks for that.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe we'll find out how much like this cost.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_03
 And then after change, change on everything at the last minute.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:25	None
 Okay.

0:15:28	None
 Okay.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_00
 That was quick.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_00
 Sort of.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_00
 Very brief presentation.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm looking at the remodels out there at the minute, and on them are particularly sleek and sexy.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_00
 I haven't actually got the examples of this raw bottom there.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_00
 But there's some curve cases that you can see.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_00
 All in half, quite a lot of buttons there.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_00
 They seem to just have the number of buttons.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_01
 Is that more of this?

0:16:01	SPEAKER_00
 It just seems to be skipping on with that.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I've found that, and then you just try and get it back.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_00
 Have you right clicked and then go into a previous one?

0:16:11	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, sorry.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_00
 There wasn't much more to say about that.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_00
 Another remodels I looked at, one of the models that did actually have voice recognition where it was connected to the remote control functions.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_00
 And it was quite a swish model where it can control forward devices to be able to start a live video, DVD, audio.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_00
 So that's a bit of competition there.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_00
 So, I mean, maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_00
 And just to mark it, it is a completely different view point.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_00
 It's the kind of finely lost control of a lot of them trying to compete with the functions.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_00
 The scroll buttons, as I've already mentioned, there's examples of those, but they don't look as sleek as other models.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_00
 And there's no real advantage.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_00
 And because it impacts on other materials in the price, it's not great.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_03
 So, are you saying the scroll buttons?

0:17:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_00
 There was a specialist type of remodeling that we could think about.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_00
 There was children's remodeling, they just had a very limited range of buttons in the world, bright and colorful, and you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_00
 But I don't know if that's really an uphill.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_02
 I guess we're going for the biggest market and maybe not.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_02
 Was it specified that we went for the biggest?

0:17:39	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we're going for the international market rather than a local market, but that wouldn't necessarily preclude.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_03
 The one thing that you can often do with products is you can make small modifications.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_03
 You have your basic model, which you would sell at, whatever.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_03
 And then you could have additional features in, you know, like a, you know, model one, model two, a model three, and therefore you can subdivide your market up.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_03
 But that's really more in your fields.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_02
 It's more like a, a, a next step, maybe, a new for hours.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_03
 You know, you could add on for an extra package, but on this basic one, I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here, and that you would have for future reference, the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost, to take care of specialist market segments.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_03
 So, so what are we deciding to do here?

0:18:39	SPEAKER_00
 I think because there's already a very good voice recognition technology out there, because hours might not cover the same functions that the media fans do.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_00
 They might have a good idea to market it as a, and find a function.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, find a function rather than as a speech function to find your remote.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_02
 So, okay.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_02
 So, they're going for the international market.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_02
 And some, so maybe all the people might not like speech recognition.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_02
 Oh yeah.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_00
 So, so, there's some languages, might not be compatible.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it would make it quite complicated, where, as these keeps, they've had the same problem.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because I think your program, this one, is a good idea to see whatever you want to your question.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, and as is quite a cheap device, I don't know how much we're going to put into it.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_03
 So, you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_03
 And you're talking about scroll buttons.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think we've decided that it's going to increase the cost in the everyday real, and it's going to be increased from the sleepness of it.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_03
 All right, so we're just going to have the rubber buttons, is that right?

0:19:57	SPEAKER_00
 And just to be aware that there are kind of specialist functions and specialist remote, but we probably don't want to focus on those, like, such as the digital.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so not to be focused on.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_00
 There was a mention, just as kind of a warning about button design, just to avoid ambiguity.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_00
 So, I'll give you the example of, say, your volume buttons were up and down, that might both have a V on for volume.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_00
 Let's think how they did this.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_03
 Good, in flip it around at 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and never up and down.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_03
 An upside down V.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_03
 So, that would show that volume was going up, whereas the one underneath it, see the volume going down.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_00
 I think the thing was that if you decide to do this, to have triangular buttons, somebody might look at this one and see, all this triangular button is pointing up, and that's the first thing that they see.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_00
 I will, no, they might see this pointing down.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_00
 I think, right, that's going to turn the volume down, whereas the actual buttons pointing up, so the function is going to turn the button up.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_00
 Be careful what you put on the buttons and be careful of the shape that you make them, because it might be kind of too contradictory and kind of shaped.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_02
 So, maybe we can have some volume written on the side, then up and down on the button design.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_03
 You could have volume up and volume up, down.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_03
 And because the idea was to have limited, it was to have sizable about of information on it, and limited number of buttons, because there were 16 buttons, wasn't there?

0:21:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's a big one.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_00
 And I think that's all I had to see before.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_00
 So, what was the decision on the design of the volume button?

0:22:07	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to go to the design of all the buttons at the moment, or we're going to...

0:22:13	SPEAKER_01
 I've got some things to say about possible design things.

0:22:16	None
 Okay.

0:22:17	None
 You're trying to do it too.

0:22:24	None
 Right.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_01
 I've been looking at some trends in sort of this fashion on top of doing the research into the remote control market.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_01
 The one that's the one I talked about last time that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls, what was good about them, what was bad, what they used.

0:22:57	SPEAKER_01
 And we've also been looking at sort of fashion, what people are wanting out of, consumer goods at the moment.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_01
 So, we've had people in Paris and Milan watching via fashion trends.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_03
 You know where they're yourself.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_01
 Just to summarize, the most important things that came out of the remote control market investigation, the most important thing was that the things sort of lock and fell fancy rather than dysfunctional.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_01
 And second, there should be some technological innovation.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_01
 And then third and less important than the other two, there should be an ease of use as well.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_01
 And apparently, the fashion trends, other people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with fruit and vegetables.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_01
 But the field of the material should be spongy, which is country to last year, partly.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sure it must have been not spooked last year.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_01
 So, we need to emphasize the fancy design on our remote control above all else.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_01
 And then also try and add in technological innovation, which could be our sort of find a thing with a hand clap.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_01
 And then we need to make it easy to use as a third priority.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_01
 So, perhaps, few of your buttons and functions as we've discussed.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_01
 And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg or the buttons could be spongy somehow.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_01
 And then, to even whacky than that, we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote, say in the shape of a banana or something like that.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_01
 Right, so maybe a banana or a courgette or something.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_01
 How far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends?

0:25:03	SPEAKER_01
 Do you think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget or do they not matter that much?

0:25:11	SPEAKER_00
 I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped, it might make it more complicated to use.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you were just talking about, you've got to be careful about how you shape your buttons because you're going to miss direct people.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_03
 I would have thought the functionality because the people get cheesed off by having to read instructions, etc.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe just one button, say the standby button is quite kind of separate from all the other functions.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe that could be a little apple.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_00
 I wouldn't get in the way of like kind of one nine and it wouldn't cook a number.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_03
 Stand by button.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_03
 No, that incorporates the trend both at the same time not confusing people.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_03
 If you're looking for functionality.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_02
 I guess maybe fruit vegetables, maybe pop in the moment.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_03
 But what are they going to be next year?

0:25:58	SPEAKER_03
 But okay, but you can incorporate that.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_03
 If you change all the buttons, then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg next year's I was going to see animals are elephants or whatever.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_03
 That means you're constantly changing your production schedule and you've got to make different molds and everything else.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_03
 Not a good idea.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_01
 I would suggest...

0:26:23	SPEAKER_01
 What were the timescare we're thinking of selling the product over?

0:26:27	SPEAKER_02
 The series we're listening to the remote control market is the kind of thing which takes those kinds of passion trends.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_02
 So it keeps us something which is maybe more universal.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_00
 As far as it's quite a subtle design.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_02
 We can make a little design of changes.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_02
 The spongy feel is...

0:26:49	SPEAKER_03
 Well, yeah.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe saw the rabbit's design in the kid.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_03
 Was that in the sort of fashion sense?

0:26:56	SPEAKER_03
 The spongy feel was that sort of fashion it was, wasn't it?

0:27:01	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:27:02	SPEAKER_00
 So you can have a couple of cases as well as buttons.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_00
 And that you can make them curved or double curved.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_02
 Oh yeah, one of the things that if you had rubber buttons and you had a rubber case.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_02
 Oh no, no, sorry.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_02
 So if you use a rubber double-cute case and you must use rubber buttons.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_02
 That's the only way.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_02
 If you have the rubber case and you have to have a rubber button, you need to get rid of it.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_03
 Rubber buttons require rubber case.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_00
 Scrolling.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_00
 Rubber buttons, whether it's spongy feel.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_03
 Have everything rubber.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_03
 The main problem is how frequently do the fashion change?

0:27:43	SPEAKER_03
 Because in essence, in the production, you want things to stay...

0:27:47	SPEAKER_03
 You want to basically mint them out.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_03
 Because if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating, then it means that your stock is...

0:27:58	SPEAKER_03
 It lasts your stock and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_03
 Which you wouldn't want to do, whereas if you kept the product the same.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_03
 But you could have a difference from year to year.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_03
 It seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like, rather than changing the whole...

0:28:17	SPEAKER_03
 You're just changing one aspect, like this down by button or something like that.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_03
 And especially because then you could make it something that...

0:28:26	SPEAKER_02
 As soon as you may be unlimited, if I raise last put a logo on the edge.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you might be limited in space.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_03
 Or you two are obviously going to find out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to how much...

0:28:42	SPEAKER_03
 How pliable is plasticine?

0:28:45	SPEAKER_02
 The cases, like changing the fashion, like the Nokia phones, where you could take the case and off the outside.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_02
 Wherever that would be too much to incorporate in production.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_02
 Wherever that would just be...

0:28:58	SPEAKER_02
 That's making it more complicated.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_03
 So you're talking about changing the casing.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the actual saw, the look from the outside, so the buttons were stay the same.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_02
 And the general function of the...

0:29:13	SPEAKER_02
 The motor stayed the same, but then you could change the way it would.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and then you could have...

0:29:17	SPEAKER_00
 Or you still would have to have the logo on every new case.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_00
 But you could have like pink cases for the old ones.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you could do a colour change, so that for you...

0:29:27	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, that's effectively what they did with the mobile phones, was to have some in blue, some in red, some in rather than all in black, which for you want as long as it's black.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:29:41	SPEAKER_00
 So they're supposed to use the company in classical...

0:29:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, oh, that's true, no, I don't mind.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, why don't you both put it in like clash with anything?

0:29:52	SPEAKER_03
 Well, not necessarily, because you could have your company...

0:29:57	SPEAKER_03
 Or may be finishing up.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_03
 You could have your company badge, and I mean, a lot of computers, for instance, like when you've got there, it actually has a sort of stick-on badge.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_03
 So what you would all...

0:30:10	SPEAKER_03
 All you would really need, whether the casing be any colour, could be any colour, but that badge would then have to stick out top of it, so that, in a sense, with a logo like that, because it's on a white background, the only colour that it might not stick out some well on, would be a white casing, because you're sort of...

0:30:34	SPEAKER_03
 You're badging it, and in fact, a lot of companies get somebody else to make them, and literally just badge them themselves with their own badge over the top.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_03
 And in fact, the way they've got that there, even if you had that on a white, dominant colour of the windows badge, you'd still be able to see it clearly from, you know, a white casing product, so...

0:30:56	SPEAKER_02
 Where have we got the big and the market, how this can like, second-year market selling their cases?

0:31:01	SPEAKER_02
 It might be, since, you can see...

0:31:03	SPEAKER_00
 Well...

0:31:04	SPEAKER_00
 What if it's for younger people?

0:31:06	SPEAKER_00
 Like, with born generation.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_00
 That's what I think would probably go down well.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_00
 And the market, I say, a child's being on that side of it, isn't it?

0:31:13	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, if people say that it's the look, or the fancy looking thing around, yeah, I'm not convinced on whether having change would cover this would be something that people buy into.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_01
 I think with the mobiles, it's a communication device, people see you with it all about,

0:31:30	SPEAKER_02
 the spurs were a bit of a keep going over it. In the house, isn't it?

0:31:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, of course.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so if we just went for one colour, it looks like...

0:31:39	SPEAKER_03
 So don't change case.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_03
 Change case colour, and we're sort of saying no to that.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_00
 Did we decide on the other case?

0:31:49	SPEAKER_00
 Did the spongey feel odd?

0:31:50	SPEAKER_00
 Did we think that that might go as a trend?

0:31:53	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it was different last year.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_01
 The trend was different last year, partly.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_01
 It was not as much a film, but...

0:32:01	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know whether the trend would change.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know whether it's one of those things that...

0:32:06	SPEAKER_01
 Like sort of having all group shaped keys that probably would go out very quickly.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_01
 Just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less...

0:32:17	SPEAKER_01
 Less of a sort of...

0:32:19	SPEAKER_01
...sensri-snold.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_03
 If you're going for a fashion trend like that, then you'd have to have interchangeable cases so that you could...

0:32:29	SPEAKER_03
 Or because otherwise someone's going to have to buy a complete new, rather than just a case.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_02
 This seems to make sense to me, which is maybe stick with a standard rubber case as well.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_00
 Well, haven't we talked about the curvature of the case?

0:32:43	SPEAKER_00
 This flat, single-curve, and this double-curve?

0:32:46	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not exactly sure.

0:32:49	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe a case gives it like a more aesthetic feel.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_02
 A double-curve would require...

0:32:54	SPEAKER_02
...to perform miracles for the past.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_02
 But it seems like...

0:32:59	SPEAKER_03
 When you say, when you say,

0:33:02	SPEAKER_01
 double-curve, what exactly does that mean?

0:33:04	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not exactly sure. I'll show you.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_00
 There's a more set up on.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_00
 See how...

0:33:14	SPEAKER_00
 Let's just get up together.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_00
 See how the one...

0:33:19	SPEAKER_00
...I'm not...

0:33:21	SPEAKER_03
 One thing to consider is that...

0:33:25	SPEAKER_03
 In some ways you want...

0:33:28	SPEAKER_03
 By having a fairly standard case, it means they can all fit together on top of each other for storage purposes and shops, and it makes it easier...

0:33:36	SPEAKER_03
...if you can store them up on top of each other.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_03
 Whereas if you do fancy things, you then have to put it in a packaging box.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_03
 That does that.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_03
 And the cost of packaging could be quite important...

0:33:50	SPEAKER_03
...of either the total cost of the product.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_02
 So should we just work out what we decided on the after?

0:33:57	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:33:59	SPEAKER_00
 It's not very clear up there, but it's like someone who has kind of bulges...

0:34:04	SPEAKER_00
...and sets one on the end.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_00
 When it's a curvy...

0:34:08	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if a double-curve is maybe...

0:34:10	SPEAKER_00
...it comes off slightly...

0:34:12	SPEAKER_01
 That's right, so I don't worry.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_00
 But it is a kind of sleek look if you've got curves in there.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_03
 So you want to go for curves, more curves?

0:34:21	SPEAKER_03
 We're meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay, so you should be...

0:34:28	SPEAKER_00
 You're going for a single curve just to compromise.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, curve to a double curve to a single curve.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_02
 So did we decide on the kinetic power supply?

0:34:36	SPEAKER_02
 Do you have to go around?

0:34:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_00
 And the other one is...

0:34:45	SPEAKER_00
 The other one is...

0:34:51	SPEAKER_00
 I don't really know much about the classical logo yet,

0:34:55	SPEAKER_02
 but possibly it's thicker. Yeah, it was like...

0:34:58	SPEAKER_02
...we're going to give the simple circuit board just to keep the car stand.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_02
 I think we can't buy...

0:35:03	SPEAKER_02
...by not having anything to come here to keep the car.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and the voice recognition...

0:35:08	SPEAKER_00
...we're going to use that car, we're just to find it.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_02
 We can always decide against it if something comes up.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_02
 That's just a bit...

0:35:18	SPEAKER_01
...like something to be like.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_01
 And then are we going for sort of one button?

0:35:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that sounds...

0:35:28	SPEAKER_00
...like you wouldn't do too much harm in a couple of years.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_00
 What sort of shape do you want?

0:35:34	SPEAKER_03
 So we've got spongy feel buttons as well, have we?

0:35:38	SPEAKER_03
 Or was that...

0:35:40	SPEAKER_01
 That's rubber buttons.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_03
 So it's rubber buttons, so it's not really spongy feel buttons.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_03
 It's just rubber buttons.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_03
 With the rubber case...

0:35:48	SPEAKER_03
...and the standby button is going to be different.

0:35:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_00
 I think an apple would be a good recognisable shape...

0:35:56	SPEAKER_00
...if you start getting all busy.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so what shape are we making the standby button?

0:36:03	SPEAKER_03
 Apple.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_00
 Apple.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry?

0:36:06	SPEAKER_00
 Should we vote on it?

0:36:07	SPEAKER_00
 We'll go for it.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_01
 We'll go for it.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_01
 It's quite big one as well.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_01
 Big apple.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_01
 What could be red?

0:36:16	SPEAKER_01
 Could be red apple.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know why.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_00
 A red apple?

0:36:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because we want to incorporate a bit of colour if we can.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_00
 Once we find out.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, and then we're going to...

0:36:27	SPEAKER_02
 You're going to work on keeping the buttons like that simple.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_02
 Just like the...

0:36:32	SPEAKER_02
 Just working out what we're going to do for the next time.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that seems pretty straightforward.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_00
 Because more so we'll just be kind of...

0:36:44	SPEAKER_00
...mimly circular or a very clean.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_03
 So what was that last thing you got in there?

0:36:55	SPEAKER_00
 Just to keep the shape of the buttons simple.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_03
 Right, do I have...

0:37:00	SPEAKER_03
...much option on that.

0:37:01	SPEAKER_03
 I thought you were going for a single curve and...

0:37:03	SPEAKER_00
...I was just the...

0:37:05	SPEAKER_00
...shaped of the buttons.

0:37:07	SPEAKER_03
 Alright.

0:37:08	SPEAKER_02
 And so yeah, just keeping the...

0:37:10	SPEAKER_02
...sort of the labelling and labeling of them pervious and what's wrong?

0:37:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_02
 Having sort of something.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_03
 Alright, so the shape of the buttons...

0:37:18	SPEAKER_03
...simple.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so...

0:37:30	SPEAKER_03
 That's that, I guess.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_03
 You know, go away and get these things sorted out.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_03
 I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever.

0:37:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so...

0:37:46	SPEAKER_02
...then...

0:37:47	SPEAKER_02
...looks like it.

0:37:49	None
 Okay.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.
