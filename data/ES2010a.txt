0:00:00	SPEAKER_00
 minutes too. So to start writing on here do you have to start by pressing anything

0:00:08	SPEAKER_01
 on this page? Okay. Well I filled a buzz. Me too. That's cool. Okay, hi everybody

0:00:20	SPEAKER_00
 welcome to our kickoff meeting for our new product that we're going to be designing. I'm Mandy and I'm the project manager and I know all your names again.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_00
 Courtney, yep. Vanilla and Amber. All right. Okay so first let's go through this PowerPoint. Wonder what button I press. Yeah or how about I just click. Okay here's our agenda for this meeting. We're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions. We're gonna get to know each other a little bit better. Tool training. We're going to I guess figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles. We're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting. Okay here's our project. We're gonna make a new remote control that's original, trendy and also user-friendly. And how we're going to do it is each of us is going to we're gonna have discussed the functional design first. How is it gonna be used? What's the actual goal here? It has to operate the TV. And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet. Same thing with conceptual design. Just the basic overview of the project.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_00
 And then we're going to do individual work. Meet that's pretty much the whole process for today. And then the detail design. Just more in depth. Get the actual schematics of the remote. Okay. All right. First we're gonna start off by using our tools. And the whiteboard thing. Do you guys want to give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you want to do it on here? I think we

0:02:15	SPEAKER_02
 should forego the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_00
 We can do it on here. All right. Let's go forth then. Right now so we're all gonna draw our favorite animal and then sum up our favorite characteristics of that animal. Even if you're not a good drawer like me. Artistic skills. No.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_02
 I like it in grade five.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_00
 Okay about one more minute.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. And who would like to start us off? I'll go. This is my picture. I do fish. I like fish because you know their whole water vascular system thing. It's pretty cool. And they've got a pretty good habitat and they're pretty sometimes sometimes vicious but that's okay. Only favor on us. Yeah they're easy you know.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. All right. Who wants to go next? I'll go. I drew a kitty. It's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat. I love cats. Yeah it does look like a cat. I love cats because they're independent. They pretty much know what they want. They get it. They move on.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_00
 I love cats too. I'm a cat person. I'm allergic to cats. I'm allergic to cats too.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_00
 Oh okay. If you're around one I had a roommate who was allergic but if she was around my cat forever she became used to. Yeah you know if you're around the

0:05:07	SPEAKER_01
 phone for you telling. I still can't sleep with them in my room. Oh yeah this summer I live with cats. It's crazy. Okay. Cool.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_00
 Badger. Good choice. Why badger?

0:05:22	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know. They're grumpy and nocturnal. Are you trying to suggest something?

0:05:28	SPEAKER_03
 Well a little bit like me. Yeah. And then she went in the middle of this badger. Oh okay.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_03
 And then I don't know if you know Brian Schach. He's a little puddling rider.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_03
 Alright. So industrial and like red wool. That kind of looks bad just for cool. Okay. And I'm last. Okay.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_00
 Look at my sad sad giraffe. Good. No no no. It ends up looking like some kind of dinosaur but whatever. I don't know even much about giraffes but I just love the way they look. They're just such odd creatures you know. I like that they're so unique and individual. I don't know much about their behavior or anything though. I've seen a couple of them. You don't really have to. Yeah. You can appreciate the way they look.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. Alright. Guess we're getting straight back into business here. The selling price for our remote is going to be 25 euro and our profit aim is 50 million euro.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to make this an international product marketed in the states in Europe in Asia. And our production costs to make that profit is going to be a max of 1250 euro per remote. Okay. So we're going to talk for a little while. Here are some topics that we might be able to discuss. Our experiences with remote controls. Our first ideas about this new remote. Anything that you can bring to the table for this project. Yeah. Yeah. I start us off. Anybody have anything to offer? Well we

0:07:11	SPEAKER_02
 want to make a multifunctional remote right? Right. One remote for everything.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_03
 Right. Everything. We have what sound system. TV DVD VHS. I think they'll be facing. Yeah. It's still there. So okay. It needs to be compatible because universal

0:07:36	SPEAKER_00
 remote controls are never universal. They're never universal. That's right. It's especially if you buy a not big product DVD player say usually it doesn't work.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. Yeah. So we're going to figure out how to cover all the different experiences and signals. We need an insanely good instruction booklet because

0:07:58	SPEAKER_01
 you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote

0:08:01	SPEAKER_00
 anyways. Okay. And another thing that I think is important is the design of the product. How it feels in your hand. If it's just flat and kind of boring. Those don't. Nobody wants to buy those anymore. They want the ergonomic ones. They want like the flashy legs. So like this keep one as Vegas. One's that look high tech too.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_03
 But at the same time or something. Right. So the people with the curvature like that

0:08:32	SPEAKER_00
 matches the curvature of a hand. Yeah. Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that. Yes. That's true. What kind of battery would we want to use?

0:08:50	SPEAKER_02
 Because battery changing is usually double A. Okay. Some of them use triple A's though.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. Some use triple A's. So double or triple. Yeah. I guess that is. We need to do

0:09:04	SPEAKER_00
 triple A. We can. But most people usually have double A's around. Okay. Yeah. But that has to do with the size of it too. Well as long as we know that issue is. Yeah. If we wanted to be more thin. We'd

0:09:16	SPEAKER_01
 probably want to go with a triple A. Could you go with a small with the battery? It's

0:09:21	SPEAKER_00
 okay. We don't have to decide about it now. Just as long as we remember battery type and size is important. Hey. Anything else?

0:09:33	SPEAKER_00
 All right. Move the loan. Oh. We're closing the meeting. Next meeting is going to start in 30 minutes. Here's what we're going to do. The ID which is who? Okay. You're going to think about the working design. Okay. And you ID. The technical functions design.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_00
 Making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do. The functionality of it.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_00
 Operating all those different things. Okay. And the marketing person. Courtney is going to do the user requirements specification. I guess that means specifying what exactly the user is going to be looking for. Right. Right. I would think so. Okay. And you're going to get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while. Okay. So does anybody have anything they want to say before closing meeting? Okay. This meeting is officially over.
