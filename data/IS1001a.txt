0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 is

0:00:23	None
 oh Uh-oh, off the menu keyboard does not surf

0:00:55	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so welcome everyone. So we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing a new remote control.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_00
 So I will first start with warm welcome, opening stuff.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_00
 Then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_00
 And then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will have to fulfill to complete this process.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_02
 So it has to one thing, except 25 minutes but I have something else to do.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_02
 So I have another meeting soon.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe you could hire a bit.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_02
 It's true.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_02
 I have another meeting so if you could...

0:02:22	SPEAKER_00
 You have another meeting soon?

0:02:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_02
 So I have to be quick for the loan more product.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_00
 So the goal is to have a remote control, so to have an advantage over our competitors, we have to be original, we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user friendly.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_00
 So the design step will be divided in three main points.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_00
 First it will be the functional design.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_00
 Third is the conceptual design and then is the design design.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_00
 So the functional design is to identify the main user needs, the technical function, the remote control should fulfill.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_00
 And then we will move to conceptual design where we will specify the different components involved, what kind of user interface we want and what are the different trends in user interface and stuff like that.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_00
 And then the detailed design will consist in specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've made in the second point.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_00
 So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control, for each of us to draw your favorite animal on the white wall.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_00
 What an original idea.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_00
 Do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us without a good term?

0:04:04	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_00
 Let's go.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_02
 You should have the same thing.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_00
 If you want to react about this wonderful drawing, I let you comment.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_02
 It's an abstract drawing of an ink tank.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_00
 It's an abstract drawing.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's nice and original.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if it's a real drawing.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_02
 It's an abstract drawing, so this is very important.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_00
 You want to draw something?

0:04:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_01
 You have to imagine a little bit.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_00
 Of course, your animal is recorded, so it's not lost.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry too.

0:05:29	None
 Did you know?

0:05:37	SPEAKER_02
 It's a cat.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's a cat.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_02
 The name is Caramel.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_01
 I think I'm too sure if I'm a cat.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_00
 Next time you'll do something, okay?

0:06:23	SPEAKER_02
 Next time I'll come.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_00
 I'm a bit short in the game.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_00
 What could they draw?

0:06:34	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe I can draw.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_00
 A very simplified code.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if it looks like a bug.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_01
 Quite square.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if it looks more like a dog.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_00
 I would say.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_00
 I hope that it helps you in the process of designing a robot.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_02
 For putting a logo.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_00
 Let's move on.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_00
 You're the financial objective of a project.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_00
 It's to say to have a prediction cost lower than 12.5 euros.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_00
 I have a selling price twice that price in order to target a profit of 50 million euros.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_00
 Is there a market for a new remote control?

0:07:46	SPEAKER_02
 It's a trendy, original, and fulfilled a single device remote control.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_00
 We have to discuss that on the finder tool.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_00
 You can suggest points like this.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_00
 We have to decide, for example, if you can control one device or multiple.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_00
 What are your ideas about that?

0:08:15	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe I can have the opinion of the other things.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_02
 If you bundled the remote control with something that we sell, then it could be a single device otherwise.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_02
 It could be a programmable one.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_02
 Otherwise, we would buy remote control from us.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_00
 So, if it sold by its own, it would rather be for multiple devices.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_00
 Do you agree?

0:08:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it should be for multiple devices.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_00
 Do you have any ideas of design ideas or any technical requirements we should fulfill?

0:09:00	SPEAKER_01
 I think we shouldn't have too many for my part.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not fighting it for any requirements right now.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_01
 If you don't have so many buttons.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_00
 A few buttons.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_00
 Do you have it also to be lighted, not to be used in the dark?

0:09:18	SPEAKER_00
 It might be a good idea.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_00
 Do you have any idea of the trend in the domain?

0:09:32	SPEAKER_00
 What it should look like or something like that?

0:09:38	SPEAKER_01
 Something which is not squarely.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_00
 With a box.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_02
 Like for something that at least fits in your hand.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_00
 The basic requirements.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_00
 So, fitting your hand.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_02
 And your pockets.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_00
 And also it may be important for the remote control to be to resist to various shocks that can happen.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_00
 What if it falls?

0:10:10	SPEAKER_00
 What a proof as well.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it is a original because you can use it in your bath.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_00
 Whereas the others count.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe water proof would be very original.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_00
 I think a water proof remote control.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_00
 So that the people can use it in their bath.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_02
 That could be similar.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_02
 But if you don't have a remote control.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_02
 You can just cover it with some plastic.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_00
 But it is still something you have to buy.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_00
 That's all the shock.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_02
 I mean there are people that have a remote control.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_02
 And they are worried that it's going to break and put some extra plastic around it.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_02
 And they actually do it themselves.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_00
 But maybe we can bulk it with already this plastic thing.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_00
 And the water proof is not working that case.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can sell all that together.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_00
 So plastic protection.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_00
 And the water proof box as well.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_00
 That might be good track to follow.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_00
 But it is not a problem.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should have something.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_01
 Most of the time I lose my remote control.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_01
 We should have a special button on the TV.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can make the remote control.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_00
 But we don't design the TV.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can have something you whistle.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_00
 And the remote control.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_00
 So we can have a whistle remote control.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_00
 A whistle.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_00
 Whistle label.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_00
 Whistle tracking.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_00
 Whistle tracking.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_00
 Whistle tracking remote control.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_00
 That's a good idea.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_00
 That's very original.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_00
 And that's quite cool.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_02
 But of course, you don't normally need any audio recording stuff on your remote control.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_02
 They have to go to the cost.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_00
 But still we have to have an advantage of our competitors.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_00
 I think this is a good advantage.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_02
 It's cool.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_02
 I think I like that there.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_02
 But I'm not sure about what you're giving us.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_00
 We have to ask the cost of that's designed to the industrial designer.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_00
 Which is you.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_00
 So try to find that for the XBT.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_00
 So next meeting is in 30 minutes of the company.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_00
 So I will ask the industrial designer to find out more about this industrial design.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_00
 So any working function we have discussed.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 So then I will ask the user interface designer to think about the point we discussed, like the number of buttons, the the fight that is lighted or not, things like that, and what would be convenient for the user.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_00
 And also we ask the market expert to try to find out what are the absolute requirements, it's absolutely needed in remote control for the user.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_00
 So and then I will just ask you to think about that and look at your mail because you will receive some good advice soon.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_00
 So thank you.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's good.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_00
 All for this point.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_02
 So welcome back in five minutes.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_02
 Have a nice day.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway you will receive some messages.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_00
 Can I check anything?

0:14:44	SPEAKER_00
 Correctly...

0:14:46	SPEAKER_02
 What?

0:14:48	None
 What?

0:14:50	SPEAKER_01
 I really see

0:14:52	None
 What? What?

0:14:56	None
 I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know
