0:00:00	None
 I'm going to get the word of ease.

0:00:07	None
 What do you wear this to me?

0:00:14	SPEAKER_02
 What do you wear this to me?

0:00:21	SPEAKER_01
 Hmm, hmm hmm hmm.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_02
 Whew.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_02
 Too many cables and stuff.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, it's not.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_00
 It's recorded. Okay.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so welcome everyone.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_00
 So we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing a new remote control.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_00
 So I will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_00
 Then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different steps we will have to design it.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_00
 And then we will discuss if we have few A's and we will end by dispatching the different tasks you will have to fulfill to complete this process.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_02
 So, just one thing. You said 25 minutes but I have something else to do.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_02
 So I have another meeting soon so maybe you could have a little bit.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_02
 So you still have another meeting so you have another meeting soon?

0:02:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so I have to be quick for the loan more product.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage of our competitors we have to be original.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_00
 We have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user friendly.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_00
 So the design step will be divided in three main points.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_00
 First it will be the functional design.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_00
 Third is the conceptual design and then it's the design design.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_00
 So the functional design is to identify the main user needs, the technical function, the remote control should fulfill.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_00
 And then we will move to conceptual design where we will specify the different component involved, what kind of user interface we want and what are the different trending user interface and stuff like that.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_00
 And then the detailed design will consist in specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've made in the second point.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_00
 So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for each of us to draw your favorite animal on the whiteboard.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_00
 So it's not a good idea.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_00
 Do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us?

0:04:02	SPEAKER_00
 Go down and go down. Okay. Let's go.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_01
 No, no.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_02
 You should not have to say anything.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_00
 If you want to react about this wonderful drawing, I'll let you comment.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_02
 It's an abstract drawing on the wrong tank.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, it's an abstract drawing.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's nice and original.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if you should write it in the name.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if it's good.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_02
 Usually when I'm put on the top of it here, so this is very important.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_00
 You want to draw something?

0:04:53	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_01
 You have to imagine a little bit.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_00
 Of course your name is recorded, so it's not lost.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I know.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry too.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_02
 What is this string?

0:05:50	SPEAKER_01
 Do you know? It's a cat.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_01
 Isn't it?

0:05:54	SPEAKER_02
 I think these things did not exist.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_02
 It's not exist.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_01
 Like that.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_01
 Oh yeah.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_00
 It's pretty.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. It's my cat.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. It's your cat.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_00
 That's not a name.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_02
 The name is caramel.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_02
 Caramel.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_02
 Caramel.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_02
 What do you want to do?

0:06:14	SPEAKER_01
 I think I'm too short for the cables.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_00
 I go.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_00
 Next time you do something, I'm sure.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_02
 Next time I come to the room.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_00
 I'm a bit short.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_00
 So what could I draw?

0:06:34	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe I can draw like a very simplified co.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if it looks like a co.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_01
 It looks like a bong.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_01
 Quite squaring.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_00
 It's scary.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_00
 It looks more like a don't-heal fact.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_00
 I would say.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_00
 I hope that it helps you in the process of designing a random puzzle.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_02
 I think I follow logos.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_00
 Let's move on.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_00
 So, you're the financial objective of project.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_00
 What is to say to have a prediction cost lower than 12.5 euros.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_00
 And I have a selling price of twice that price in order to target a profit of 50.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_00
 A million euros.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_02
 Is there a market for a new remote control?

0:07:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_02
 If it's trendy, original, and fulfilled, the single device remote control or the multi-device remote control.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_00
 We have to discuss that.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_00
 It's undefined at all.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_00
 You can suggest points like this.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to decide, for example, if you can control one device or multi-parallel.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_00
 So what are your ideas about that?

0:08:14	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe I can have the opinion of the last thing.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_02
 If you bundle the remote control with something to sell, then it could be a single device.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_02
 Otherwise, it could be a programmable one.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_02
 Otherwise, who would buy remote control from us?

0:08:29	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_00
 So if it's sold by its own, it would rather be a formidable device.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_00
 Do you agree?

0:08:38	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe it should be for multiple devices.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_00
 And do you have any ideas of design ideas or any technical requirement we should fulfill?

0:09:01	SPEAKER_01
 I think we shouldn't have too many for my part.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_02
 I cannot fight a thing for any requirements right now.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_01
 If you don't have so many buttons, it would be nice.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_00
 A few buttons, okay.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_00
 And do you have it also to be lighted in order to be used in the dark?

0:09:18	SPEAKER_00
 Might be a good idea.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_00
 And do you have any idea of the trend in the domain?

0:09:32	SPEAKER_00
 What it should look like or something like that?

0:09:37	SPEAKER_01
 Something which is not scary, maybe.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_01
 With round?

0:09:42	SPEAKER_01
 With round.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_00
 Like, okay.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_02
 Something that at least fits in your hand.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_02
 The basic requirement.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_00
 So, fits in your hand, yeah.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_02
 And then you're back.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_00
 And also it may be important for the real world.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_00
 It's important for the real world to be, to resist to various shocks that can happen.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_00
 What a proof as well.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it is original because you can use it in your bath, whereas the others count.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe waterproof would be very original.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_00
 I think a waterproof remote control.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_00
 So that the people can use it in their bath.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_02
 That could be useful.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_02
 It seems so, but if you don't have an waterproof remote control, you can just cover it with some plastic.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_02
 And you can't hold it.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but it is still something you have to buy and that is a...

0:10:44	SPEAKER_00
 And that's sort of the shock.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, there are people that have their remote control and they're worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_02
 But maybe that's the word they actually do themselves.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_00
 But maybe we can bulk it with already this plastic thing and the waterproof stuff.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_02
 That's why.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can sell all that together.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_00
 So, plastic protection and the waterproof box as well.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_00
 That might be a good track to follow, like an option I think.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_00
 I think we should have something.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_01
 Most of the time I lose my remote control.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_01
 We should have a special button on the TV.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can have the remote control.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_00
 But we don't design the TV.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we can have something you whistle and the remote control beat.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_00
 Clocks.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_00
 Clocks.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_00
 So we can have a whistle remote control.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:51	None
 Whistle.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_00
 Whistle label.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_00
 Whistle tracking.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_00
 Whistle tracking, yeah.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_00
 Whistle tracking remote control.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_00
 That's a good idea.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_00
 That's very original and that's kind of...

0:12:06	SPEAKER_02
 That's quite cool.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_02
 But of course, you don't normally need any audio recording stuff on your remote control, right?

0:12:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_02
 Just going to add to the cost.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but still we have to have an advantage of our competitors.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 I think this is a good advantage.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_00
 It's cool.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_02
 I think I like that there.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_02
 But I'm not sure about what you...

0:12:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_00
 Who you have to give in a budget.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_00
 We have to ask the cost of that's a design to the industrial designer.

0:12:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_00
 Which is you.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_00
 So try to find that for the XBD.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_00
 So next meeting is in 30 minutes.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_00
 So I will ask the industrial designer to find out more about this industrial design.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_00
 So when you're working function, we have discussed.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 So then I will ask the user interface designer to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons, the file that is lighted or not, things like that.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_00
 And what would be convenient for the user.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_00
 And also, we have the market expert to try to find out what are the absolute requirements, what is absolutely needed in a remote control for the user.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:13:42	SPEAKER_00
 And then I will just ask you to think about that and look at your mail because you will receive some good advice soon.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_00
 So thank you.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's good all for this point.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_02
 So we'll come back in five minutes.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_01
 I forgot.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_00
 I knew I would receive some messages.

0:14:21	None
 Yeah.

0:14:24	None
 That's GSA.

0:14:27	None
 Be careful.

0:14:29	None
 Yeah, because I just gave it a little bit of a...

0:14:34	None
 I'm not the only one.

0:14:37	None
 Does it move?

0:14:39	SPEAKER_00
 Or also, but...

0:14:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_00
 But I don't know if it's still correctly...

0:14:47	SPEAKER_02
 What?

0:14:49	None
 What?

0:14:50	SPEAKER_01
 I really see.

0:14:53	None
 I'm not sure.

0:15:00	None
 I'm not sure.

0:15:03	None
 I'm not sure.

0:15:08	None
 I'm not sure.
