0:00:00	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, good morning.

0:00:03	SPEAKER_00
 It's our first team meeting.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_00
 Good morning.

0:00:05	SPEAKER_00
 Good morning.

0:00:06	SPEAKER_00
 I'll be your project manager for today for this project.

0:00:09	SPEAKER_00
 My name is Mark Knopf.

0:00:10	SPEAKER_00
 I'll be giving this presentation for you to kick the project off.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_00
 That's my, let's see your agenda for today.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_00
 Of course, we're new to each other.

0:00:18	SPEAKER_00
 So I'd like to get acquainted first.

0:00:20	SPEAKER_00
 So let's do that first.

0:00:21	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, let's start with you.

0:00:23	SPEAKER_00
 Can you introduce yourself?

0:00:24	SPEAKER_00
 You're a marketing expert.

0:00:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_02
 My name is Derek.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_02
 Derek Mangfeld.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_02
 I will be a journalist project marketing expert.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_02
 And I will see what the user wants and what we can do with the new project.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. Excellent.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_00
 And you are a new user interface.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_01
 New user interface designer.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to look at the technical design from the user point of view.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_01
 Excellent.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_03
 My name is Xavier JÃ¶rgens.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_03
 I'm the industrial designer.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_03
 And there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_03
 First one is what happens inside the apparatus.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_03
 Second is what is the apparatus made of and the third is what should it look like.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_00
 What should it look like?

0:01:12	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_00
 Let's kick it off.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_00
 There we go.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_00
 So our new product is about we need designer remote control for television set.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_00
 So which has to be original, trying to end user friendly.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_00
 I took this off corporate website.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_00
 I think that sums up what we need to do.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_00
 We're inspired by the latest fashion only in electronics but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_00
 That's why our project will always fit in your home.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_00
 So apparently we need to be very open to what's currently hot in the market.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_00
 So that's what you need to do to bring us latest info on what people want.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_00
 So we put the fashion electronics so that's what we need to go for.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway, we'll take this project in three steps.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_00
 Three phase of design.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_00
 First step will be the functional design.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_00
 And this is basically what we're going to do.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_00
 Everybody has a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards so we can share information about it.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm going to keep the shorts and write a technical problem.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_00
 So skip through this.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_00
 Every meeting we, everybody can present their views and everything.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_00
 So to help with these, we have the smart boards here.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_00
 You can use a regular PowerPoint presentation.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_00
 And so both of us give you an introduction on this dueling board.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_00
 So it's actually very easy.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_00
 Like it says, very simple.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_00
 You just take out the pen.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_00
 Like you see here.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_00
 I'll just take the tool over here.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_00
 Sit.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_00
 You just put it on the board.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_00
 You see a pen here.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_00
 You go here.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_00
 You just select using a pen.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_00
 You can just draw whatever you want.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_00
 Select your eraser.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_00
 Interace whatever you want.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_00
 And so it's will be easy to just illustrate your views.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_00
 If you want to change the format, either take, oh, you select the pen.

0:03:01	SPEAKER_00
 And whatever you want.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_00
 You're current color, the line width.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_00
 Just to make the line bigger.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_00
 So that's super easy.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_00
 It's just to take the, just take a new slide and back again.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just going to keep using this board all the time.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_00
 So I think it will be, it's very clear for everyone I suppose.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to take this out.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to use that later anyway.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, just, just, this stuff that you want to share.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_00
 Just put it in the, in the project folder.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_00
 Like I put my presentation now.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_00
 I'll put the, the minutes of every meeting.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_00
 I'll put them there too.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_00
 So everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_00
 So next, I've been here.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I'm going to give the electronic whiteboard a shot.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_00
 So basic ideas.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_00
 We have a blank sheet.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_00
 Just try whatever you want.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_00
 And like it says, draw your favorite animal.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_00
 I think the creative genius should go first.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_00
 The creative genius, thank you very much.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_00
 So draw your favorite animal.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm not really good at drawing animals.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_01
 But the animal which I pretty much, oh, still the racing.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_01
 I'm a pen.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_01
 I have four more.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_01
 Where else my animal will be like, king side.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_01
 I pretty much like a dolphin.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_01
 Because if it's freedom basically, let's see.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_01
 The head.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_01
 I don't actually work with this.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_01
 It's like a very high tech.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_01
 Bit low response of though.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_01
 Prefer pen and paper.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_00
 So that's what we don't want.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_00
 Want the high responsive products.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_01
 It looks like a nuclear bomb.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_01
 Doesn't look like a nuclear bomb.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_01
 This thing isn't doing what I'm.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_00
 Let's go easy on it.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_01
 It does look like a nuclear bomb.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_01
 I'll just finish up real soon.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 So it doesn't really look like a dolphin.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway, this is all new from the first read of the often.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_00
 You like the freedom that it represents.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_01
 Like the ocean, like swimming.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_01
 Do that in my spare time.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_01
 So that's basically it.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_00
 What'd you like?

0:05:47	SPEAKER_00
 Well, now we can forget the seven-hub and show us an animal.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_02
 I like the elephant.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_00
 Take a clean sheet.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_00
 Take a clean sheet.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_00
 Press next.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_02
 Or a blank.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_02
 Free.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_02
 I like the elephant.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_02
 It's big.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_02
 It's strong.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_02
 So.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, it's a little bit.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_01
 It's not.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_01
 It's a little bit.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_02
 It's a beautiful animal.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, you have to press it pretty hard.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_02
 With a smile on it.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_02
 It's very important.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_02
 It's a cute elephant.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_02
 And not forget it's still.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, it's a nice beard.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_02
 No, it's okay.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_01
 I'm making comments on my dolphins.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_02
 I will beat the dolphin.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so it's just to be.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_00
 So I suggest you make us the elephant in the market.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_00
 The big and strong player in the market.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_00
 That's gonna be good.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, excellent.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_02
 I'll enter the next one.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, you should press next.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_00
 Next, yeah.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_00
 It's up there.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, well, the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_01
 You picked a hard one, didn't you?

0:07:50	SPEAKER_03
 It's my drawing skills already.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_02
 What?

0:07:55	SPEAKER_02
 They are.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_03
 They are really bad.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_02
 My drawing skills.

0:07:58	None
 Okay.

0:07:59	None
 I'm sure it looks smooth.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure how to make sure to do it.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_03
 These are stripes.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_03
 I've picked this animal because it's very fast.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_03
 It is, it knows exactly what it wants.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_03
 It hardly ever waces any resources.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_03
 What does it want?

0:08:49	SPEAKER_03
 Well, basically, it hunts for prey.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_03
 But it does it always in a very well thought way.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_03
 It knows exactly what it wants.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_03
 It never kills an animal just for the killing.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 So it's very efficient and it tries to do everything as fast as possible.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_03
 And it always goes for security in seeking hide spots and doing everything.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_03
 Security, speed and efficiency is important.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_03
 And I think that it's great.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_03
 And things we can do.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yay, I'm supposed to draw the animal next.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_00
 I introduced it to the world of the amazing ant.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_00
 Hard worker.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_00
 Great team workers.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_00
 Do everything really small but together.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_00
 It's really strong.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_00
 You have to smiley face.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_00
 Not sure where the six pod or the just put them here, whatever.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_00
 I think it needs shoes.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a cool thing.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_01
 It's a cool thing.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_01
 It's a cool thing.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_00
 It's a cool thing.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_00
 It's a cool thing.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_00
 You've done this before.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_00
 I love to draw.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_00
 It's my hobby.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's very representative of what we drew.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_00
 I guess.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_00
 You take your free and use a trendy interface.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_00
 You're supposed to make it different from what other people have and make it a little distinct.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_00
 I think it has another beat to stop the meeting.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_00
 See.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_00
 Warning.

0:11:08	None
 Finish meeting now.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_00
 Put this down.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_00
 As well.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_00
 I guess we have a little time extra on it.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_00
 Just a little quick discussion to open our work.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_00
 What do you guys think about the first ideas is very short.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_00
 I'll start with you.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_00
 What are your first ideas for new products?

0:11:26	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I basically had a question.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_01
 Are you going to introduce a multi remote control?

0:11:30	SPEAKER_01
 Is it just the TV or do we want to?

0:11:33	SPEAKER_00
 The project I got was just for TV remote control.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_01
 Just for TV remote control.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_01
 I guess.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I was thinking about design remote control with our motto and all.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_01
 The thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_01
 No rational changes or whatever.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_00
 So very intuitive design.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_00
 I guess.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_01
 We might have to consider other design aspects of our product.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_01
 So that was something I wanted to add.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_01
 And perhaps some usability aspect TV is becoming central in most homes.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_01
 Do we want people who are disabled in any way to be able to use it as well?

0:12:18	SPEAKER_00
 I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_00
 I think really disabled people might be a problem.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_00
 But I think it's a little thing to take into consideration.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_00
 I think we really need to cut the meeting short.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_00
 Anything you want to share quickly?

0:12:35	SPEAKER_03
 Only one thing that has to be an as according to me is the material it is made of.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_03
 It should be something light.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_03
 Speak to itself.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_03
 It should be light.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see where did I skip that.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, this is it.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry, skip this sheet.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_00
 What do we, this quick, what we're going to selling price 25 euros.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_00
 That's for you, the production price 12 and a half euros.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_00
 Approximately just go for that and we'll reach you.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_00
 Reach that profit.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's not much to look at.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_00
 No, it's not much to work with.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sorry, I skipped it.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway, it's, yeah, this is it.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_00
 Do you have anything you, you came up with yet about marketing transfer or whatever?

0:13:16	SPEAKER_00
 About what?

0:13:17	SPEAKER_02
 Marketing?

0:13:18	SPEAKER_00
 Marketing transfer.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure what you came up with yet.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_00
 You have anything to share as we'll cut the meeting just.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_00
 Make sure it's in for a special set.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_02
 No, not really yet.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_02
 I have some ideas and I will.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_02
 Anyways.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_00
 So the personal coach will give you the your personal assignments and everything.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_00
 So we'll just meet back in your 30 minutes.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_00
 I'll share it.

0:13:37	None
 We have that.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_03
 Good luck, everyone.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, thanks for attending.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, I'll see you back in your 30 minutes.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:43	None
 Yes.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:14:19	None
 Okay.
