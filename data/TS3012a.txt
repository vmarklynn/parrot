0:00:00	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, good morning.

0:00:02	SPEAKER_00
 It's our first meeting.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_00
 Good morning.

0:00:05	SPEAKER_00
 Good morning.

0:00:06	SPEAKER_00
 I'll be your project manager for today for this project.

0:00:09	SPEAKER_00
 My name is Mark Knopf.

0:00:10	SPEAKER_00
 We'll be giving this presentation for you to kick the project off.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see a Jennifer today.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_00
 Of course, we're new to each other, so we'd like to get acquainted first.

0:00:20	SPEAKER_00
 So let's do that first.

0:00:21	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, let's start with you.

0:00:23	SPEAKER_00
 Can you introduce yourself?

0:00:24	SPEAKER_00
 You're a marketing expert.

0:00:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_02
 My name is Derek.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_02
 I'm Derek Meinfeld.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_02
 I will be a genius project marketing expert, and I will see what the user wants and what we can do with the new project.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_02
 Excellent.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_00
 And you're our new user interface?

0:00:45	SPEAKER_01
 The user interface designer.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to look at the technical design from the user point of view.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_01
 Excellent.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_03
 My name is Sophia JÃ¼rgen.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_03
 I'm the industrial designer, and there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_03
 First one is what happens inside the operators.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_03
 Second is what is the operators made of, and the third is what should it look like?

0:01:08	SPEAKER_00
 I should it look like.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_00
 Let's kick it off.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_00
 There we go.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_00
 So our new project is about we need to design a remote control for a television set.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_00
 So it has to be original, trying to end user friendly.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_00
 I took this off our corporate website.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_00
 I think it sums up what we need to do.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_00
 We're inspired by the latest fashion, not only electronics, but also the latest strengths and clothes and interior design.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_00
 That's where our project will always fit in your home.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_00
 So apparently we need to be very open to what's currently hot in the market.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_00
 So that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info on what people want.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_00
 So we put the fashion electronics.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_00
 So that's what we need to go for.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway, we'll take this project in three steps.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_00
 Three phases of design.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_00
 First step will be the functional design.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_00
 And this is basically what we're going to do.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_00
 Everybody has a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards so we can share information about it.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm going to keep this short since we had a technical problem.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_00
 So skip through this.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_00
 Every meeting we, everybody can present their views and everything.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_00
 So to help with these, we have the smart boards here.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_00
 You can use a regular PowerPoint presentation.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_00
 I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_00
 So it's actually, it's very easy.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_00
 Like it says, it's very simple.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_00
 You just take out the pen.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_00
 Like you see here, I'll just take the toolbar with you.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_00
 That's it.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_00
 You just put it on the board.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_00
 You see your pen here.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_00
 You go here.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_00
 Just select using your pen.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_00
 You can just draw whatever you want.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_00
 Select your eraser and erase whatever you want.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_00
 And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_00
 If you want to change the format, you just either take, oh, you select the pen and whatever you want.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_00
 Your current color, the line width, just to make the line bigger.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_00
 So that's super really easy.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_00
 Just take the, just take a new slide and back again.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_00
 I'm just going to keep using this board all the time.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_00
 So I think it will be, it's very clear for everyone I suppose.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_00
 I'll take this out.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to use that later.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway, just stuff that you want to share.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_00
 Just put it in the project folder.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_00
 Like I put my presentation now.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_00
 I'll put the minutes of every meeting.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_00
 I'll put them there too.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_00
 So everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_00
 So next, I've been here.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I'm going to give the electronic whiteboard a shot.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_00
 So basic idea is we have a blank sheet.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_00
 Just try whatever you want.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_00
 And like it says, draw your favorite animal.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_00
 I think the creative genius should go first.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_00
 The creative genius, thank you very much.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_00
 So draw us your favorite animal.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_01
 Well I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm not really good at drawing animals.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_01
 But the animal which I pretty much, oh, still erasing.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_01
 And for my animal, it will be like king side.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_01
 I pretty much like dolphin because of its freedom basically.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_01
 Let's see.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_01
 Ahead.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_01
 I haven't actually worked with this.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_01
 It's like a very high tank.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_01
 Bit low responsive though.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_01
 For pen and paper.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_00
 That's what we don't want.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_00
 Want the high responsive product.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_00
 So it looks like a nuclear bomb.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_01
 Doesn't look like a nuclear bomb.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_01
 This thing isn't doing what I want.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_00
 So let's go easy on it.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_01
 It rather does look like a nuclear bomb.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_01
 I'll just finish up real soon.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_01
 Look at that.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_01
 So it doesn't really look like a dolphin.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway, this is only from.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_00
 It's supposed to be dolphin.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_00
 You like the freedom that it represents.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_01
 Like the ocean, like swimming.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_01
 Do that in my spare time.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_01
 So that's basically it.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_00
 What do you like?

0:05:44	SPEAKER_00
 OK.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_01
 Well, now we can forget the show.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_00
 Mark the expert.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_02
 Show us an animal.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_02
 An animal.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_00
 I like the elephant.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_00
 Pick a clean sheet.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_00
 Pick a clean sheet first.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_00
 It's pressed next.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_02
 That's it.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, blank.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_02
 OK, next.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_02
 I like the elephant.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_02
 It's big.

0:06:06	SPEAKER_02
 It's strong.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_02
 So it's a little bit.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_01
 It's not really that responsive.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_02
 It's a beautiful animal.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, you have to press it pretty hard.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_02
 With a smile, man.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_02
 It's very important.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_02
 It's a cute elephant.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_02
 And not to forget it still.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_00
 Oh.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_00
 It's a nice beard.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_02
 No, it's OK.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_01
 Do you want to make a comment on my dolphin?

0:07:12	SPEAKER_02
 I will beat the dolphin.

0:07:15	SPEAKER_00
 OK, so it's just to be.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_00
 So I suggest you make us the elephant in the market.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_00
 The big and strong player in the market.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_00
 It'd be good.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_00
 OK, excellent.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_00
 On to the next one.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_03
 OK, you should press next.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, next.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's up there.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_00
 OK.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_02
 That's it.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_03
 OK, well, the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_01
 You picked a hard one, didn't you?

0:07:50	SPEAKER_03
 It's my drawing skills.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_03
 I really think that's it.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_02
 What?

0:07:54	SPEAKER_02
 They are?

0:07:55	SPEAKER_03
 They are really bad.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_03
 My drawing skills.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_02
 OK, yeah.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_00
 Sure looks smooth.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure how to make sure you're not.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_03
 Ah, these are stripes.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_03
 I've picked this animal because it's very fast.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_03
 It knows exactly what it wants.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_03
 It hardly ever wastes any resources.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_03
 What does it want?

0:08:49	SPEAKER_03
 Well, basically it hunts for prey, but it does it always in a very well thought way.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_03
 It knows exactly what it wants.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_03
 It never kills an animal just for the killing.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_03
 So it's very efficient.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 And it tries to do everything as fast as possible.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_03
 And it always grows for security in seeking a high spot and doing everything, security, speed, and efficiency is important.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_03
 And I think there are things we can do.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yay, I suppose to draw the animal next.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_00
 I introduce to the world of the amazing ant.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_00
 Hard worker.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_00
 Great team workers.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_00
 You know, do everything really small and together and really strong.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_00
 You have a smiley face.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure where the sixth parlor, just put them here, whatever.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's neat shoes.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_00
 Just two days to draw it all black, sir.

0:10:06	None
 That's the coolest animal I've ever seen.

0:10:11	None
 I think it's a great thing to do.

0:10:16	None
 I think it's a great thing to do.

0:10:20	None
 I think it's a great thing to do.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a great thing to do.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_00
 That's the coolest ant ever.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_01
 You've done this before, haven't you?

0:10:34	SPEAKER_00
 I love to draw ants.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_00
 It's my hobby, anyway.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's very representative of what we drew, I guess.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_00
 Like you take your freedom and use a trendy interface that you design for us.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_00
 You're supposed to make it different from what other people have and just make it a little distinct.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway, thank you for stopping the meeting.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_00
 See, morning, finish meeting now.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to put this down.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_00
 It's not full as well.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_00
 I guess we have a little time extra of it.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_00
 Just a little quick discussion to open our work.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_00
 What do you guys think about the first ideas?

0:11:20	SPEAKER_00
 It's very short.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_00
 I'll start with you.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_00
 What are your first ideas for a new product?

0:11:24	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I basically had a question.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_01
 Are you going to introduce a multi-remote control?

0:11:29	SPEAKER_01
 Is it just the TV or do we want to?

0:11:31	SPEAKER_00
 The project I got was just for a TV remote control.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_01
 Just for TV remote control, I guess.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_01
 I was thinking about design remote control with our motto and all.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_01
 The thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_01
 No rational changes or whatever.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so very intuitive design.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_01
 We might have to consider other design aspects of our product.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_01
 So that was something I wanted to add.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_01
 Perhaps some usability aspect.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_01
 TV is becoming central in most homes.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_01
 Do we want people who are disabled in any way to be able to use it as well?

0:12:18	SPEAKER_00
 I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_00
 Really disabled people here.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 It might be a problem, but I think it's a little thing to take into consideration.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_00
 I think we really need to cut the meaning short.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_00
 Anything you want to share quickly?

0:12:35	SPEAKER_03
 Only one thing that has to be in it, according to me, is the material it is made of.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_03
 It should be something light.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_03
 It should be light.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, let's see where that...

0:12:48	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, this is it.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry, I skipped this sheet.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_00
 Quick, we're going to selling price 25 euros.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_00
 That's for you, the production price to often half euros.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_00
 Approximately, just go for that and reach that profit.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_00
 Not that much.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_00
 No, it's not much to work with.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sorry, I skipped it.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway, this is it.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_00
 Anything you came up with yet about marketing transfer, whatever.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_02
 About what?

0:13:17	SPEAKER_00
 Marketing?

0:13:18	SPEAKER_00
 Marketing transfer, I'm not sure what you came up with yet.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_00
 You have anything to share as we cut the meaning just?

0:13:22	SPEAKER_02
 Not really yet.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, I have some ideas and I will...

0:13:28	SPEAKER_00
 Anyways, the personal coach will give you your personal assignments and everything.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_00
 So we'll just meet back in your 30 minutes.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_00
 Now, share, we have that.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_03
 Good luck, everyone.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_00
 Thanks for attending.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_00
 I'll see you back in your 30 minutes.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:10	None
 Okay.

0:14:17	None
 Okay.
