0:00:00	None
 penis Okay.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_03
 Alright, that did nothing. Okay. Welcome to the meeting, everyone.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just going to attempt to make this into a slideshow.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry, guys.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_02
 I need to be a professional student. I did. Twice.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_03
 I'll just take it off.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_03
 Well, whoa.

0:01:43	None
 Okay, we'll have to deal with it like this, then.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_03
 Alright. This is the first meeting for developing a new product here. I'm Heather, I'm your project manager.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so that was the opening. The first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_03
 Everyone can go around and explain their role and their name.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, my name is Poppy. I'm the industrial design and release project.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase. Also the conceptual design and the detail design for the final product.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_03
 Nice to meet you, Poppy.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_02
 My name is Tara. I'm the user interface designer. I will also be responsible for the functional design phase, the conceptual design phase and the detail design phase of the user interface design.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_01
 Hi, I'm Genevieve. I'm the marketing expert. I'm an expert at marketing.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_01
 I'll be telling you guys about the user requirements specifications for a new product.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_01
 I'll be doing some trend watching in the conceptual design and product evaluation for the design phase.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_03
 Alright, I'm Heather. I said I'm your project manager.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you can pretty much read what I'm doing.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_03
 And tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today, as well as planning the project, how we're going to create this product and discuss our aims and objectives of this.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_03
 Which brings us to our next subject.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_03
 As a team, we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_03
 We want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_03
 Completely new style so that can really appeal to a generation that doesn't want a simple plane kind of.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_03
 Channel changer and it needs to be user friendly for maybe for an example for people that can't see the numbers as well or perhaps an ergonomic design.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_00
 This is the television remote control.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, it's a television remote control.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_03
 I believe it should be taking minutes on this right now.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_03
 The way that we're going to go about this is we'll have a time where we can come up with new ideas alone and work on the project.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_03
 And then after we've brainstormed and thought about we can come together in a meeting and discuss what kind of functional design we want to use.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_03
 Same with conceptual design and detail design.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_03
 So making sure that it's usable, that has a.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_03
 And that it's feasible to create and.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_03
 Come up with a concept of what we want it to look like.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_03
 Tool train.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_03
 I'll save everyone.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_03
 No?

0:05:58	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_03
 Great.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_03
 One thing that we're going to do is become more acquainted with the tools that we have access to for our project.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_03
 One of them is our whiteboard and as a sort of team building moment.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_03
 I'd like us to try out the whiteboard by expressing our favorite animal and the characteristics of that animal.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_03
 Why that why that should be your favorite animal.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm assuming that we should do that now.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_03
 With our microphone still attached to our bodies.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:06:43	None
 Okay.

0:06:50	None
 Okay.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_03
 Two come up.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_03
 This is a team building time.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_03
 Cool.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_03
 My favorite animal, which changes all the time.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_03
 Right now it is an elk.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_03
 So It's got a big air.

0:07:35	None
 Okay.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_03
 It has Holly growing out of its head.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_00
 Do you have elk?

0:07:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_03
 You have moose.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_03
 You have moose.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_03
 I mean deer.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_03
 Do you have?

0:07:55	SPEAKER_03
 We have sheep.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_00
 Cal.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, it's not really good.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_00
 We have a good artist.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_00
 Thanks.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_03
 This is my.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_03
 Very shapely.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_03
 That's a sketching of my elk.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_03
 It is my favorite animal right now because it is a large, beautiful majestic creature.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_03
 In a way it looks kind of awkward because it's on spinning legs.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_03
 But it can really overcome harsh terrain.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_03
 Although it's gorgeous, it's also very dangerous because it has strong antlers.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_03
 It can really combat its enemies even if it's an herbivore.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_03
 But it can really defend itself.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_00
 Good.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to take minutes while you guys are on the show.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_03
 You guys express your favorite animals.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_00
 I think animal level had all sorts of animals.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_00
 But the moment I'm going to draw a cat memory of my cat that died recently.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_00
 It is a strange story.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_00
 A lot of artists have been petted with more cartoon class.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_00
 I like cats because they're so independent and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_00
 But that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable because they enjoy interacting with humans as well.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_00
 They seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and running around outside as well as the inside and enjoying the food.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_00
 Generally they just seem so cool and they just know what they're doing.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_00
 I recognize they got assaulted.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_00
 They know what they want.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_00
 They see as well like cats.

0:10:38	None
 Okay.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_02
 I think my favorite animal would be a dog.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_02
 But I'm not really sure how I'd draw one.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_02
 I've never drawn a dog so I think.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_02
 I'm tempted to draw a snail coz I draw a dog.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_02
 It's going to be a really funny dog coz I'm not sure how to draw a dog.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_00
 Well they're loads of different types of dogs.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sure a representative one kind of dog.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_02
 I'm a cartoon dog.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_02
 I don't need to.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not a cartoon.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_02
 That is not a quick dog.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_02
 We can sort of like a person.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_02
 Panokio.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_02
 I draw a dog.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_02
 That's because it has a lot.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_02
 Oh my god.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_02
 You know what it's supposed to do.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_02
 I don't talk.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_02
 I like dogs because they're so good to humans.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_02
 They can be trained to be pretty dogs and see an eye dogs.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_02
 There's just such friendly animals.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_02
 The more of a companion than cats.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_02
 I've got them against cats.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_02
 I don't really like me so I can't like them.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_02
 There's just a family and one like honey.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_02
 That don't look like that.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_01
 Alrighty.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 I feel like a robot.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_01
 Well I guess had the most time to think about it.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to draw a butterfly.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 I saw a butterfly yesterday that seemed to be the symbol of spring arriving.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_01
 It was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_01
 I thought it was pretty cool in Scotland.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_01
 It was a little pointier than that.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_01
 At first I thought it was a dead leaf.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_01
 It landed on the wall next to me.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_01
 This part was all brown and then had these big blue dots like this.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_01
 There was a green ring and there was red going out like this.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_01
 It was kind of like a peacock.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_01
 It kind of was actually.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_01
 This part of the body was really dull and then it was the most colorful exotic butterfly ever.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_01
 I'm like wow this is the middle of Scotland in the park.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 I thought that was pretty cool.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_01
 It landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_01
 I wish I'd had my camera.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_01
 That's going to be my favorite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that spring is finally here.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_01
 Great.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_03
 Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that?

0:13:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yes I do.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_03
 So now that we know how to use the whiteboard.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_03
 The next thing we need to address is our financial department to meet our budget.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_03
 Or not meet our budget but more like what kind of selling range we'll be looking at.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_03
 I want to make this as a selling price of 25 euros.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_03
 So we have to come up with a way to create a remote control where we can like the price to create it.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_03
 We would like to make 50 million euros.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_03
 I'm assuming that's what the M means.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_03
 And make it for an international market.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_03
 One thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of different kinds of VCRs.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_03
 Things like that depending on which country you are.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_03
 Another thing for the design team to think about.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_03
 We wanted to cost absolute maximum of 12 euro and 50 cents.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_01
 Okay so we'll have 100% profit then.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_01
 12.50.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_03
 I'm bad at math.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_03
 So now that that is underway.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_03
 It is discussion time so this is time for us to bring our initial ideas.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_03
 Suggestions that you may have so far and your personal experiences with remote controls and areas you see that could be improved in your experience with them.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_03
 Does anyone have any initial thoughts?

0:15:45	SPEAKER_01
 I find it in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_03
 So it's something we could do to remedy that.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_00
 I just find that in our house the remote control always goes into things.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_00
 Why is the remote control?

0:16:03	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking device with a remote control or something.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_00
 Signal that you could find out where it was.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_00
 Some kind of alarm.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_00
 You can press a button on your wall.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_00
 It's a great idea.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_00
 And they always get blessed.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 Do you not find that, like, there's a lot of buttons that you look at?

0:16:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_00
 They don't use hot pads.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_00
 They don't use.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_01
 There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_01
 So all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_00
 That's useful.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_01
 It is.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_01
 It's a number button, power button, TV video button.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_03
 Anything about the look of the remote control that you might have ideas about?

0:16:58	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it could be instead of like a standard rectangular shape.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_03
 It could be something more interesting.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_03
 Any ideas we'll do that you have at this point?

0:17:08	SPEAKER_01
 It could be shaped like a conch.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe like a shell shaped.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_00
 It could hold it.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_00
 I would go into kind of novelty fact to say.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_03
 Well, if it's a trendy original aspect we're going for, I mean, you're the designer to decide what kind of direction you want to go in.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_03
 But at this point in the first meeting, it can be any ideas that we just throw out there.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_00
 So if we're heading to have a huge profit out of this, it needs to be quite a university except a thing, like a novelty thing in my own cell if you things rather than like a general kind of more acceptable.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_00
 But we don't want to go to a boring because that one's alright.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_03
 And key issue here is being trendy and original.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_03
 That does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_03
 We have five minutes left.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_03
 So just to cover.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_03
 We have one more thing.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_03
 You can go over your ideas, of course, in your own personal times.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_03
 Our next meeting will be in half an hour.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_03
 Say, half an hour to think about what you want to present or not present but bring to the meeting.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_03
 ID, whatever that stands for.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_00
 Industrial designer.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_03
 Industrial designer.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_03
 After remembering these things.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_03
 You'll be beginning your working design.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_03
 You ID the technical functions design will be worked on the next 30 minutes.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_03
 Let me be how this can be achieved and we need the user requirements from the managed marketing expert.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_03
 You will get specific instructions of what to do in the next half an hour and I'll see you in half an hour.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:19:01	None
 Thank you.
