0:00:30	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_03
 I thought I did nothing.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_03
 Welcome to the meeting everyone.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just going to attempt to make this into a slideshow.

0:01:11	None
 Sorry guys.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_03
 I need to be a professor.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_03
 I did twice.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_03
 Why it won't?

0:02:03	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_03
 This is the first meeting for developing a new product.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_03
 I'm Heather.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_03
 I'm your project manager.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_03
 So that was the opening.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_03
 The first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_03
 Everyone can go around and explain their role and their name.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_00
 My name is Poppy.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_00
 I'm the industrial designer's project.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_00
 Also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_03
 Nice to meet you Poppy.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_02
 My name is Ty.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_02
 I'm a major intervacier designer.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_02
 I will also be responsible for the functional design phase, the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_02
 I'm a user interface designer.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_02
 Hi.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_01
 I'm Jen and I'm the marketing expert.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_01
 I'm an expert at marketing.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_01
 I'll be telling you guys about the user requirements specifications for a new product.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_01
 I'll be doing some trend watching in the conceptual design and product evaluation for the design phase.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_03
 I'm Heather.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you can pretty much read what it is what I'm doing.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_03
 The tool training is one thing we're going to be doing today as well as planning the project, how we're going to create this product and discuss our aims objectives.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_03
 Which means I'm starting next subject.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_03
 As a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_03
 We want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy, completely new style so that it can really appeal to a generation that doesn't want a simple, plain channel changer.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_03
 It needs to be used or friendly for example for people that can't see the numbers as well or perhaps ergonomic design.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_00
 This is television remote control.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_03
 It's a television remote control.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_03
 I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_03
 The way that we're going to go about this is we'll have a time where we can come up with new ideas alone and work on the project and then after we've brainstormed and thought about we can come together in a meeting and discuss what kind of functional design we want to use, same with conceptual design and detailed design.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm making sure that it's usable and that it's feasible to create and come up with a concept of what we want it to look like.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_03
 Tool training.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_03
 One thing that we're going to do is become more acquainted with the tools that we have access to for our project.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_03
 One of them is our whiteboard and as a sort of team building moment, I'd like us to try out the whiteboard by expressing our favorite animal and the characteristics of that animal.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_03
 Why that should be your favorite animal.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm assuming that we should do that now.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, let's make sure you're that animal.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, cool.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_03
 Right now it is an elk.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_03
 All you growing out of its head.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_00
 Do you have elk?

0:07:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_03
 You have moose.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_03
 You have moose?

0:07:53	SPEAKER_03
 I mean a deer?

0:07:55	SPEAKER_03
 Do you have sheep?

0:07:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, cows.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, you have a good artist.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_03
 This is my very shape.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, that's the sketching of my elk.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_03
 And it is my favorite animal right now because it is a large, beautiful, majestic creature that in a way it looks kind of awkward because it's on spin the legs and it can really overcome harsh terrain.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_03
 And although it's gorgeous, it's also very dangerous because it has strong antlers and it can really combat its enemies even if it's an herbivore but it can really defend itself.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, good.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to take minutes while you guys express your favorite animals.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_00
 I think animal ever had like all sorts of animals but the moment I'm going to draw a cat in memory of my cat that died in the sun.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_00
 And it is a strange thing.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_00
 Not as artistic as Heather's, but I like cats because they're so independent and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_00
 But that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable because they enjoy interacting with humans as well and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and running around outside as well as the inside and enjoying the food.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_00
 Generally, they just seem so cool and they just know what they're doing.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_00
 I recognize they've got it sorted. They know what they want.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_00
 They see us like, cat.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. Okay, I think my favorite animal would be a dog but I'm not really sure how he'd draw one.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_02
 I've never drawn a dog so much.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_02
 I'm tempted to draw a snail because I draw them. It's going to be a really funny dog because I'm not sure how to draw a dog.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_00
 Well, they're loads of different types of dogs. Sure, a representative one kind of dog.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_02
 It's a certain dog.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's a scary character.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_02
 That is not a good dog.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_02
 We can treat it like a person.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_02
 Panacchio.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_02
 He draw a dog. That's supposed to be a dog.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_02
 Oh my god.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_02
 I know what it's supposed to be.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_02
 It's a dog.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_02
 I like dogs because they're so good to human.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_02
 They can be trained to be pretty dogs and see an eye dogs.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_02
 They're just such friendly animals.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_02
 They're more of a companion than cats.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_02
 Cats, cats, cats don't really like me so they can't like me.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_02
 But they're just so friendly and warm and nice.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_02
 But don't look like that.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_01
 Alrighty.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 I feel like a robot.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I guess I had the most time to think about it.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to draw a butterfly.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_01
 I saw a butterfly yesterday that seemed to be the symbol of spring arriving.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_01
 It was the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_01
 I thought it was a little pointier than that.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_01
 At first I thought it was a dead leaf.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_01
 Then it landed on the wall next to me.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_01
 This part was all brown and had these big blue dots like this.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_01
 It was green and red going out like this.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_01
 It was kind of like a peacock.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it was actually because this part of the body was really dull.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_01
 Then it was the most colorful, exotic butterfly ever.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_01
 I'm like, wow, this is a little Scotland in the marsh.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 I thought that was pretty cool.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_01
 I landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_01
 That's going to be my favorite animal.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_01
 After all the snow, it seems to say that spring is finally here.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_01
 Great.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_03
 Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that?

0:13:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, I do.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_03
 Now that we know how to use the whiteboard.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_03
 The next thing we need to address is our financial department to meet our budget.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_03
 We're not meet our budget, but more like what kind of selling range we'll be looking at.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_03
 I want to make this as a selling price of 25 euros.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_03
 I want to come up with a way to create a remote control where we can, like the price to create it will be significant.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_03
 We'd like to make 50 million euro, I'm assuming that's what the end means, and make it for an international market.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_03
 One thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of different kinds of VCRs, things like that, depending on which country you are, another thing for the design team to think about.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_03
 We want it to cost absolute maximum of 12 euro and 50 cents.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_01
 We'll have 100% profit then.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_03
 I'm bad at math.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_03
 Now that is underway, it is discussion time.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_03
 This is time for us to bring our initial ideas.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_03
 I would suggest that you may have so far and your personal experiences with remote controls and areas you see that could be improved in your experience with them.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_03
 Does anyone have any initial thoughts?

0:15:45	SPEAKER_01
 I find it in the dark, it's often hard to know what button you're pushing.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_03
 So it's something we could do to remedy that.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_00
 I find that in our house, there's no remote control always goes in.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_00
 It's always worried there's no remote control.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking device with remote control, or a signal that you could find out where it was, then some kind of alarm you can press a button on your wall.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_00
 It's a great idea.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_02
 Do you not find that there's a lot of buttons on your look?

0:16:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, they don't use hot pads.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_01
 There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_01
 So all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something, that's useful.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_01
 So you just have the number buttons, power button, TV video button.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_03
 Anything about the look of the remote control that you might have ideas about, maybe it could be instead of like a standard rectangular shape, it could be something more interesting.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_03
 Any ideas we'll do that you have at this point?

0:17:08	SPEAKER_01
 It could be shaped like a cauch.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_00
 I could hold it.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_00
 I would go into a novelty fact, I could say.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_03
 Well, if it's a trendy original aspect we're going for, you're the designer to decide what kind of direction you want to go in, but at this point in the first meeting you can be any ideas that we just throw out there.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_00
 So if we're heading to have a huge profit out of this, it needs to be quite a university accepted thing.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_00
 A novelty thing on my own is sell a few things rather than a general kind of more acceptable.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_00
 But we don't want to go to a boring place, that one is all right.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_03
 And key issue here is being trendy and original.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_03
 That does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_03
 We have five minutes left.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_03
 So just to cover, we have one more thing, like you can go over your ideas, of course, in your own personal times.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_03
 Our next meeting will be in half an hour, so you have half an hour to think about what you want to present, or not present, but bring to the meeting.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_03
 What if that stands for? Industrial designer? Industrial designer? You have to remember these things.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_03
 You'll be beginning your working design.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_03
 UID, the technical functions design, will be worked on the next 30 minutes.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_03
 Let me be how this can be achieved.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_03
 And we need the user requirements from the marketing expert.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_03
 You will get specific instructions of what to do in the next half an hour, and I'll see you in half an hour, okay?

0:18:59	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.
