0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 Excellent. So I sent you the agenda that was in the project document, I don't know if you've got a chance to just have a look at it.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_02
 Anyway, the meeting is going to follow more or less the same structure as last time, so we'll go around each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_02
 And at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_02
 So that's we need to know about the components, properties, materials, the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, do you understand again? Okay. I've got 40 minutes.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_00
 So I haven't played a PowerPoint. We have a bit of a passion.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_00
 I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_00
 I'll put that back in and go down.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so basically I'll start off by, I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_00
 And what we can do is that we can start rubbing off the options that we do not require.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_00
 I'm putting in the options that are more highlighted and aligning them or something like that.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so I'll start again with a brief introduction to that anyway.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_00
 Brief introduction to the insides of a mode control and then we can probably discuss the various components.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so what you see here is this is the outside of the remote.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_00
 If you open it, you have a circuit board here.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_00
 And this is the chip that I was talking about last time.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_00
 This basically sends information to a transistor here, which then sends the information to an LED device here.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_00
 If you flip the printed circuit board, and this is the most important point here, everything else is kind of.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so if you flip the circuit board, this is what it looks like.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_00
 So you see, for example, a particular button attaches to a particular place on the PCB.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_00
 And on pressing this button, a circuit completes.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_00
 The information goes to the chip, which is somewhere here, and the chip then translates the code into an infrared radiation, which goes out through there.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_00
 So the important point that I read over the website was that the configurations of these printed circuit boards are quite too many.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_00
 You can get them printed as you want to.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_00
 So we can have a configuration irrespective of the cost the way we want to have it.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_00
 So that's the important point here.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_00
 So these are the different options that we have.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so the batteries, I'll start with the battery.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_00
 So they can be simple, which is like the normal batteries in our results.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_00
 These are the kind of different kinds of batteries that the company makes.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_00
 So hand dynamos.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_00
 Does that mean like a wind up one?

0:03:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if you want to consider this, but these are the different things that the company makes.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_00
 So they'll come internally from the company.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_00
 They'll be cheaper.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_00
 All these options.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_00
 So the third one is the kinetic energy one.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_04
 You can make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike and then people could exercise walls, watching TV and charging the remote.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_04
 And still worrying about the whole RSI.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_00
 It's a good option.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_00
 So what was the kinetic energy one?

0:04:27	SPEAKER_00
 The kinetic energy one is that they're usually in modern watches since our hand keeps moving.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_00
 It keeps the watch ticking.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_00
 But I don't know if it is a good idea for a remote control because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_00
 As soon as you pick it up, it moves and then again it recharges or something.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_00
 And the fourth option is the solar cells, which are also made by the company.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_00
 Environment friendly.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_00
 So I'll enlist things and then we can come back and discuss what we think from everybody's perspective.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_00
 There are different cases that can be provided.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_00
 They can be basically the shape of the cases.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_00
 They can be flat.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_00
 They can be curved with one sided curved and one sided flat.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_00
 And they can be curved with on both the sides.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_00
 These are the three options.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, this would be like the overall shape of the remote control.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_00
 Would it be flat on both the sides?

0:05:35	SPEAKER_00
 Would it be curved from one side?

0:05:40	SPEAKER_00
 There are different kinds of supplements available.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_00
 Like it can be in plastic, rubber, wood or titanium.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_01
 Would you say woah?

0:05:50	SPEAKER_01
 Wood?

0:05:51	SPEAKER_01
 Wood.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_04
 Oh.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_04
 It can be remote.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you understand why when we get to work with it.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_00
 So we can use even, titanium is also used in the company to make some space design equipment.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_00
 So it's kind of, it'll be probably nicer to use because it relates to the overall image of the company.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_00
 But it cannot be used on a double curved surface.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_00
 If you choose this, we cannot use titanium.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_00
 For these two, we can use titanium, wood, rubber or plastic.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_00
 The interface options now.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_00
 So we can have push buttons like most remote do.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_00
 And our company is an expert in making push buttons.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_00
 We can have scroll wheels like the ones on mouse pointer.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_04
 And the...

0:06:52	SPEAKER_00
 So do you actually have a phone?

0:06:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_00
 Something like that.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_00
 So, and they have, they can even have an integrated push button inside the scrolling.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_00
 The scroll plus push.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_00
 So this is something that has been recently developed by the company in the last decade.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_00
 So not too recent.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_00
 And LCDs.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_00
 We can have LCDs.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_00
 These two are recent.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_00
 And this is quite old.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_00
 The various electronic options are...

0:07:29	SPEAKER_00
 So this concerns first of all the chips I showed you that...

0:07:34	SPEAKER_00
 So there is a chip behind this one, right?

0:07:37	SPEAKER_00
 The PCB is inexpensive.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_00
 So we can put in whatever we want.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_00
 But the various integrated circuit options are...

0:07:44	SPEAKER_00
 We have either a simple one or a regular or advanced.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_00
 And the price goes up as we go down, obviously.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_00
 So the good thing about why we would want to use advanced...

0:08:11	SPEAKER_00
 Why we might want to use advanced is that LCDs can only come with the advanced chip.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_00
 We need regular or advanced for scroll wheels.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_00
 And the chip basically includes the infrared sender.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_00
 Besides this, under electronics, also the company has started making a sample sender, which did not explain what it was.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_00
 But I'm guessing that...

0:08:50	SPEAKER_00
 So they have a sample sender and a sample speaker.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm guessing that the sample speaker is probably something like, you know, as soon as you press a button, it gives you feedback.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_00
 One, five or whatever.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, on.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_00
 And I don't know whether a sample sender has to do something with voice recognition or not.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_00
 But anyway, so these are the different options that we have.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_00
 So that's basically...

0:09:23	SPEAKER_00
 Now I think that we can integrate the user interface and the marketing things in that...

0:09:33	SPEAKER_00
 To keep taking out things from this and underlining things that are important.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_02
 Excellent.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_02
 Do you want to stay somewhere near the board so that if we need to...

0:09:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, sure.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_02
 You can sit down, but just...

0:09:45	SPEAKER_02
 We might need you to leap up.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_03
 What do you have now?

0:09:50	SPEAKER_03
 I have some PowerPoint here.

0:09:53	None
 Okay.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_02
 Can these pens give you a cancer overhand?

0:10:25	SPEAKER_04
 I suppose we'll come in and click in and say...

0:10:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it should do it.

0:10:33	None
 Right.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_02
 Interface concept.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_03
 To be honest, actually, I mentioned some of the things which could fit under this talk.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_03
 This time I mentioned the more ID in the previous talk.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_03
 So, yeah, this time I might not have them on the slides, but I can just mention them again.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_03
 So I thought I would also include the definition of using interface.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_03
 So it's the aspects of a computer system or a program which can be seen by the user.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_03
 And which the mechanism that the user uses to control is operation and input data.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_03
 So this would include things like shape and size and buttons and voice recognition as well and color and so on.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_03
 The method I employed this time was again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_03
 Then analyzed them from the point of view of user friendliness and also whether their appearance was pleasant.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_03
 And then this can help us to decide which reaches we want to incorporate in our product.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_03
 So some findings.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_03
 So in the case of many user interfaces, they are just so full of buttons that it's actually hard to find the ones you really want to use.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_03
 And it's just confusing.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_03
 It takes time to learn.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_03
 And I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_03
 Some of them are here.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_03
 The picture is not very clear.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_03
 But as you can see there are actually, oh, oh, sorry for that.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_03
 Let's go back.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, please.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_03
 So yeah, they are quite big and have many, many buttons.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, all these I personally prefer this one because it's the smallest and with least with the smallest number of buttons.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_03
 And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_03
 So let's carry on with this.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_03
 So other findings.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_03
 Some new things used.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_03
 Some of them were mentioned already by our technical designer.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_03
 Our own company has developed a new user interface.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_03
 Wait.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_03
 No, this is not the one.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_03
 There is a, we can include voice recognition and it allows.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_03
 It's possible to record 80 different voice samples on it.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_03
 So this one was already mentioned, the LC display.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_03
 Another new development is a scroll button, which was also also already mentioned.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_03
 And our own manufacturing division has designed a new programmable speech.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry, a speaker unit, I guess it should be.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_03
 And this means that once it comes together with a voice recognition, but it's once the, once the, it recognizes the voice of the speaker, there can be a pre-programmed answer.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_03
 For example, you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says hello and your name or whatever.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_03
 So, I mean, this is also one of the new developments which we might consider if we wanted to.

0:14:49	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry, can you go back for a second?

0:14:52	SPEAKER_00
 Are you sure what this means, the spinning wheel with the LC display?

0:14:56	SPEAKER_02
 It's like the, like you said, no, the scroll button.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, the scroll button is a different thing.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_03
 I have a picture if you, just a moment, I'll show you.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_03
 I wasn't completely sure myself, but I think it's just like, it's a wheel, it's like not separate buttons.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_03
 Look, this one here, but I'm not really sure whether you can really turn it around.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_03
 It's like a press this or this.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_04
 It's like, you know how you have your mouse and you go around and it's kind of like that and you spin around and it's okay.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_00
 So instead of going down, you just spin.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_04
 You just go around and it's a bit weird at first, but it's actually very fast.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_04
 Like the wheels that click on the side, you get a much slower set.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_04
 It's quite good if you're like searching quite a lot of stuff.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_04
 So, you know, if you're looking, you're scrolling through the A to Z and you're looking for something at T, then it's a lot faster than the wheel, but you've got a lot less control over it.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_00
 I think that you include that here as well as CVs plus spinning.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, and the personal preference is pretty much the same as last time.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_03
 It has to be a small, simple, okay, we decided to include voice recognition.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_03
 So, the standard major buttons like gone off, the channels and then volume, and then there will be menu on the screen.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_03
 And I also thought if we want to put small and nice, and actually I quite like the idea of a scrolling button, with voice like, I don't know, like on the movements or something.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_03
 I think there is no reason why we couldn't do something like this for the remote control.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_03
 So, yeah, that's it. That's it. Excellent.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, straight to trains and then we can discuss it all at once.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_01
 I can't wait. I have a little bit of a nice, and a little bit of a quick difference.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, if you're too good by stealing it.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, no, no.

0:17:19	None
 It's not the same thing.

0:17:24	None
 No, no, no, no.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, no.

0:17:31	None
 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

0:17:36	None
 Oh, no, no, no.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, cool.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_04
 What I always do is search the inserts, come up with market trends, and you know what users are going to be wanting in the near future.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_04
 So, the first aspect is about only twice as important as the second aspect, which is twice as important as the third aspect.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_04
 So, I mean, the easy to use thing is fairly low down on there, which I think given the target group is what you would expect.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_04
 You know, people want something new, something technologically innovative and different, so the whole idea with the LCDs and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is like quite a thing to go for.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_04
 And yeah, it would still look funny.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_00
 So, maybe as you're discussing things, is it okay if we just keep highlighting things there?

0:18:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_00
 So, so, so, so, so, so probably voice recognition is kind of important, right?

0:18:55	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe the LCD and spinning.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay, I have a point about LCD, I don't know if it is the right point to take it up.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_00
 LCDs are basically for feedback, right, to the user who is pressing buttons, and the feedback can come through the television itself, so do we need a hand sitting on the remote?

0:19:12	SPEAKER_04
 It depends how fast your television runs really, don't you think?

0:19:15	SPEAKER_04
 I only have one of those, tell you where spot is, and you put the number in the remote, and then you wait, and then it goes to the TV, and then you wait, and then it comes, so it actually takes quite a long time.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_04
 So, if you get the number wrong, then it's a bit of a pain, so I think, you know, a screen on the remote would probably get down the time of that, but like, the roads do tend to get thrown about a bit.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_02
 It is also quite nice, though, to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen, so if you're watching something.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's true.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_04
 I think it would be like, I mean, if you can make it integrate with the TV, then it can come up with your information about what's on, and you could just see that on the remote

0:19:50	SPEAKER_02
 rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_04
 But I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone, you know, like you have the slide you want, and you have the flip you want, and then the screen is protected, so it doesn't actually get scratched, so you can have like, what looks like a normal remote control, you know, or like a minimalist remote control, so you got your buttons one to nine, you're on and off, and your volume on that, and then if you want to mess about it, you flip it open, and, yeah.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_00
 So we seem to have a consensus that LCDs are definitely the way to go because of style,

0:20:24	SPEAKER_04
 and yeah, so that kind of decides your whole chip thing.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_00
 Right. You agree?

0:20:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_00
 So, okay.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_00
 LCDs.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_00
 Definitely.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_00
 Go on.

0:20:36	None
 Okay.

0:20:37	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_04
 Apparently, these are vegetables we'll be providing inspiration, so I discovered your part.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_04
 So these will be an important feature for clothes, shoes, and furniture.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_04
 So, I mean, I'm taking this to mean, you know, carviness, you know, because you don't tend to get flat vegetables, you know, possibly even uneven, like, a bit of asymmetry and stuff, but that would be a good way to get in the whole RSI issue in the videos.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand, right hand, so you want to, you can't have it so that it's too small for you to use your right hand.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_02
 Something a bit squishy.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_02
 We have.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_00
 It'd be like a robbery.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_00
 We have a robbery.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_00
 But, I think it's a good case with using.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I suppose you wouldn't get a remote control.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_02
 And it'd help if you drop it, to protect it as well.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_00
 So, if we use latex cases, they won't allow us to use solar cells as an emergency.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_00
 We could use titanium, food, or plastic.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_02
 Or if we want to use the latex, then we have to go with one of the other.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_04
 We'll have a nice show.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_04
 We could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_02
 From down to down.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_02
 You can have it as like a little bald.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_04
 So, yeah.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_00
 So, probably double curved surfaces the way to go.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_00
 So, we're curved at one end and flat on the top, because I'm not sure if it is flat on both the sides, then how much easy would it be to reach for buttons, etc.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_04
 It depends on the whole.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_04
 It's like how you put your hand on a single side curve.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_00
 Single side curve, double side curve does not say too much does it?

0:22:56	SPEAKER_04
 No, I don't think it makes a lot of difference.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_04
 I have one of those slidey bones and the back is essentially straight, but it's curvy.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_04
 Besides, you have four sides to a thing.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's curved.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_04
 One side means one side is straight.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_04
 And curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy thing.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_00
 Did it say anywhere in your research material about the sliding stuff?

0:23:23	SPEAKER_00
 Because according to the information that I have, I think the only options that we have with the case is that we used to be.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_00
 We either have a black surface to the case or a curved surface case.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_00
 It does not say anything about whether technically this stuff is available at all.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_04
 It's more about the protection of the LCD.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_04
 We have one of the keys where it came on.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_04
 My research didn't tell me anything, which is why we have all the pictures.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_04
 That's what I had to do with my time.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_04
 What have we got?

0:23:54	SPEAKER_04
 Combined style with a level of functionality, beauty and practicality.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_04
 And a piece of functionality.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_02
 So, looking at what we've got, we want to now set it up to display with a spinning wheel.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_00
 Let's try to rub off things.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_00
 Rub off some of those.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_00
 So, hand dynamics are definitely out, right?

0:24:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_02
 That's not streamlined and sexy having a wind up.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_00
 Um, kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of a appeal, but...

0:24:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's rather practicality really, isn't it?

0:24:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_00
 As against a watch, which constantly keeps moving, this thing will have to be tapped every time, which might be very frustrating for the user.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_02
 Depends how much movement it really needs.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_01
 I don't have to mention that.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_02
 Presumably, if they're suggesting it, then we could use it.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_00
 Let's keep it off.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_00
 I'll keep it off.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_00
 Um, the flat, completely flat case is definitely out, right?

0:25:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_01
 It has to be removed from one side.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_00
 Not vegetable.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_00
 Um, okay.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_00
 We still have all the options.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_00
 What do you think would be very...

0:25:11	SPEAKER_03
 What is...

0:25:12	SPEAKER_03
 I can't...

0:25:13	SPEAKER_03
 How do you...

0:25:14	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, you can't keep it really small.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_03
 You can't make it like thin and...

0:25:18	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_03
 I would think because you need to put all the technology in.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_03
 So, I mean, if the case, you had the case.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_00
 If it is really...

0:25:28	SPEAKER_00
 If it is really...

0:25:29	SPEAKER_00
 If it is really thin, it's like you to break.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_00
 It's like it's much more...

0:25:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_02
 Given that we're looking at more spongy material preferences, would think maybe rubber or plastic as well.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_04
 That's true.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_04
 It's not a practical...

0:25:47	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, it's right for a table, but for a micro control, you know?

0:25:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_04
 And splinters and stuff.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_04
 What is that?

0:25:57	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't make any sense, I think.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_00
 In the case of remote control, remote really.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_00
 Now for the really interesting stuff, the interface.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_00
 So, the push buttons is our expertise in the industry.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_00
 But it seems to be out of trend, you know, no big thing.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but I have some push buttons.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_03
 I think for the channel numbers, you still need them, wouldn't you?

0:26:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_00
 So, for channel numbers...

0:26:25	SPEAKER_00
 If you have LCD displays that opens up a whole world, you know, if you have an LCD display, then you can select almost everything on the LCD display.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I think the LCD display is kind of...

0:26:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's faster with...

0:26:36	SPEAKER_03
 And when we discuss that, we might like the flipping open thing.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, you can use it as a normal remote control.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_03
 But if you do want to use LCD, then you flip it open, but it's more time consuming.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_04
 I think this is going back to the graph at the beginning that I made, where, you know, the buttons, the people use all this honey on buttons for them.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_00
 And everything else.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_00
 Many don't.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_00
 So, in the buttons we have, for the channels also, we have options.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_00
 Do we enumerate everything from zero to nine?

0:27:05	SPEAKER_00
 Or do we have just a channel plus channel minus?

0:27:09	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, I mean, we definitely need the numbers because it's...

0:27:13	SPEAKER_03
 Otherwise, people don't want to flip through all the channels.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_02
 Do we need them as buttons or do we need them as LCD?

0:27:20	SPEAKER_00
 On the LCD we can, you know...

0:27:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I would say buttons because it's...

0:27:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_04
 It's...

0:27:27	SPEAKER_04
 I think the thing is, if someone just wants to turn on the TV and put on a channel, then it should be easier to use than any other remote.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_04
 And then if someone wants to, you know, change the contrast on their TV and...

0:27:40	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_04
 They should be able to do that and it should be accessible, but, you know, I mean, most of the time, I mean, there's a limit to how much the biggest technology can spend fiddling with the TV.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's the issue here.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_00
 So, buttons definitely, but...

0:27:57	SPEAKER_00
 Shall we try to draw...

0:28:00	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's what you guys are going to do next.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_02
 So, I'm going to put down the key.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_00
 So, components.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_00
 So, what about the scrolling?

0:28:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I'm not completely clear.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_03
 About the spinning wheel.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_03
 You cannot include everything in the spinning, if you just spin it.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_04
 I would say the spinning goes at a higher speed to the scrolling wheel.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_04
 So, you have to decide whether you want to be going so fast or not.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_04
 But, I mean, the thing with this hole, you're planning on making it out of rubber, and the basis that it's spondy.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_04
 And I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_02
 But if you've got a...

0:28:48	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, you can...

0:28:49	SPEAKER_02
 If you've got a flip thing, effectively, it's something that's curved on one side and plait on the other side, but you fold a little in half.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but your spinning wheel tends to go to one side.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_02
 That would be on one side.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think so too.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, the case would be rubber and the buttons.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_00
 Or at the corner edges, just the edges covered by rubber or something like that, everything else in plastic.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_00
 Or even titanium if you want to use it.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_04
 Or maybe like interchangeable cases.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_04
 Because I know, like, we're going back to eye pods again in the whole spinning wheel, but I have like a...

0:29:24	SPEAKER_04
 Now, obviously my eye pod is not made of rubber, and then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it, and I can change the color.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_04
 The U.S.A.T. to march my outfit.

0:29:33	None
 Right.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_00
 So that gives us a more trendy look as well.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think the spinning wheel is definitely very narrow.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and we're going more for the trend stand for the usability anyway.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_00
 That's right.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, after.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_00
 So, rub that out.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_00
 And colors can be provided with the case rather than...

0:29:58	SPEAKER_00
 But we still need to think about the color of our moda such.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think it was a requirement that we use our...

0:30:06	SPEAKER_03
 The colors of our company.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_03
 So would it be like yellow, gray and black or something?

0:30:11	SPEAKER_03
 I guess.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_04
 That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable thing.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_03
 Bananas?

0:30:16	SPEAKER_03
 Bananas?

0:30:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yellow.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, definitely.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, do you think we could incorporate the colors of the company into the buttons and then make the colors the main remote.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_04
 The color like vegetable colors, you know?

0:30:26	SPEAKER_04
 So you could have like...

0:30:28	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I suppose vegetable colors would be all in green and some reds and maybe purple and that.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_04
 And then you'd paint the buttons and company colors to match the color.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_00
 If you go over to the integrated circuits, since we are having LCDs, there's no way that we will be able to.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_00
 What we do need to consider however is that the price is going up with every such thing that we are considering.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_00
 But since LCDs seems to be a definite yes.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_00
 So it seems to be one area where we would want to spend.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_00
 So I'll rub off the other two.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_04
 So we're discounting solar energy because rubber is going to be used in there somewhere.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_04
 Or...

0:31:14	SPEAKER_02
 That was the...

0:31:15	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, so the constraint was...

0:31:17	SPEAKER_00
 We can't have solar panels.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_00
 Solar panels with rubber.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:31:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, okay.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_04
 So you really lose that, I think.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_02
 Should we go for...

0:31:27	SPEAKER_02
 If we're going for rubber, we think of it as our case.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_02
 And then...

0:31:33	SPEAKER_03
 And the buttons as well.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_00
 I think...

0:31:38	SPEAKER_00
 We'll have...

0:31:40	SPEAKER_00
 Using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, although it does seem interesting.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_00
 But it does not hold any advantages as that.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's just to get it.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so we understand this better now that the speaker is for the feedback, right?

0:32:04	SPEAKER_00
 It says the things that you type in or something like that.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:32:09	SPEAKER_02
 I think if we can include them not too much extra cost, then I'd put them in...

0:32:14	SPEAKER_00
 We don't have too much information about it.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I think it should be quite cheap because it's from a company company.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_00
 So this is in as well then.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm supposed to be good.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_02
 And the case is curved on one side but in flat.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_02
 Flat on the top.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_02
 Flat. So it's flipped.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_02
 Into each other.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_02
 Can I pull the...

0:32:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, sure.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_02
...the computer.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_01
 Just so I can...

0:33:00	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry, Joey.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_02
 Nothing gets right.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_02
 I'll just...

0:33:07	None
 Okay.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_04
 What is ICSC?

0:33:13	SPEAKER_00
 ICs, integrated circuits.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_04
 So it's advanced integrated circuits?

0:33:20	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_04
 Welcome to the...

0:33:25	SPEAKER_00
 We're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as on CDs.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_02
 So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_02
 The advanced chip.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_02
 And curved on one side case which is folded in on itself.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_02
 Made out of rubber.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_02
 And the buttons are also rubber.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_02
 We're having push buttons on the outside and then on the inside an LCD with spinning wheel.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_02
 And we're incorporating voice recognition.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_02
 That's however all contact.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_02
 And it's going to look sort of digital and be in bright vegetable colours.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_03
 So would we have the spinning wheel inside with the LCD or would it be on the altar?

0:34:36	SPEAKER_03
 Imagine being inside.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_04
 So actually that could like really cut down your thing.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_04
 So you've got your outside which is like minimalist and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel which you can incorporate buttons into.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_04
 So you've still not got like a lot of stuff in there.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_04
 You've maybe got like if you're modelling on an iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel and fours of it and doing the wheel.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_04
 And the other one's a little bit inside.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:35:11	SPEAKER_02
 Sure.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_02
 So now we've got 30 minutes before our next meeting.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_02
 In the meantime the industrial designer over here is going to work on the look and feel design which I presume will work out what that means.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_02
 The user interface designer will work on the user interface design and the marketing expert is going to work on productive evaluation.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_02
 And as well as that the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_02
 That all okay.

0:35:54	SPEAKER_02
 And anyone who hasn't put their presentation in the project documents folder it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it.

0:36:06	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to go and sit on my own.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_02
 Nobody wants to talk to you.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_02
 I know.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_04
 I'm plugging in.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_04
 I've got a bit tangled up in here.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_03
 Shall I move away first or shall I stay here?

0:36:19	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_03
 I would care.
