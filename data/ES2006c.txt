0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 Excellent. So I sent you the agenda that was on the project document. I don't know if you've got a chance to just have a look at it.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_02
 Anyway, the meeting is going to follow more or less the same structure as last time. So we'll go around each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_02
 And at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_02
 So that's we need to know about the components, properties, materials, the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, do you understand? Okay. So I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation. Yeah, I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_00
 So basically I'll start off by I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options. And what we can do is that we can start rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that are more highlighted and lining them or something like that.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anywhere. Brief introduction to the insights of a mode control.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_00
 And then we can probably discuss the various components.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so what you see here is this is the outside of the remote. If you open it, you have a circuit board here.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_00
 And this is the chip that I was talking about last time. This basically sends information to a transistor here, which then sends the information to an LED device here.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_00
 If you flip the printed circuit board and this is the most important point here, everything else is kind of.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so if you flip the circuit board, this is what it looks like. So you see, for example, a particular button attaches to a particular place on the PCB.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_00
 And on pressing this button, I circuit completes the information goes to the chip, which is somewhere here. And the chip that then translates the code into an infrared radiation, which goes out through there.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_00
 So the important point that I read over the website was that the configurations of these printed circuit circuits are quite hard to make. You can get them printed as you want to.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_00
 So we can have a configuration irrespective of the cost the way we want to have it.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_00
 So that's the important point here. So these are the different options that we have. Okay, so the batteries, I'll start with the battery.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_00
 So they can be simple, which is like the normal batteries in our results. Yeah. These are the kind of different kind of batteries that the company makes.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_00
 So hand dynamos.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_00
 Is that me like a wind up one? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if even if you want to consider this, but these are the different things that the company makes. So they'll, since they'll come internally from the company, they'll be cheaper. All these options.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_00
 So the third one is the kinetic energy one.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_04
 You can make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike and then you could exercise walls, watching TV and charging the remote. Yeah.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_00
 And still worrying about the whole OSI.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_00
 So what was the kinetic energy one is that usually in modern watches, since our hand keeps moving, it keeps the watch ticking.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_00
 But I don't know if it is a good idea for a remote control because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes. As soon as you pick it up, it moves and then again, it recharges or something.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_00
 And the fourth option is the solar cells, which are also made by the company environment friendly.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_00
 So I'll enlist things and then we can come back and discuss what we think from everybody's perspective. There are different cases that can be provided.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_00
 They can be basically the shape of the cases. They can be flat. They can be curved with one sided curved and one side flat.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_00
 They can be curved with on both the sides. These are the three options.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, this would be like they were all shape of the remote control. Yeah. Would it be flat on both the sides?

0:05:36	SPEAKER_00
 They can be curved from one side or there were different kind of supplements available. Like it can be plastic, rubber, wood or titanium.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_01
 Would you say, whoa, wood, wood.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, you understand why we get to purpose.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_00
 So we can use even so titanium is also used in the company to make some space design equipment.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_00
 So it's kind of it'll be probably nicer to use because it relates to the overall image of company.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_00
 But it cannot be used on a double third surface. If we choose this, we cannot use titanium for these two. We can use titanium, wood, rubber or plastic.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. The interface options now.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_00
 So we can have push buttons like most remote too. And our company is an expert in making push buttons.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_00
 We can have scroll wheels like the ones on mouse pointer.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, something like that.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_00
 And they can even have an integrated push button inside the scrolling.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_00
 So this is something that has been recently developed by the company in the last decade.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_00
 So not too recent. And LCDs. We can have LCDs. These two are recent.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_00
 And this is quite old. The various electronic options are.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_00
 So this concerns first of all the chips. I showed you that.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_00
 So there's a chip behind this one, right? The PCB is inexpensive.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_00
 So we can put in whatever we want. But the various integrated circuit options are. We have either a simple one.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_00
 Or a regular.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_00
 Or advanced.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_00
 And the price goes up.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_00
 So the good thing about why we would want to use advanced.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_00
 Why we might want to use advanced is that LCDs can only come with the advanced chip.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_00
 We need regular or advanced for scroll wheels.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_00
 And the chip basically includes the infrared center.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_00
 Besides this in the electronics.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_00
 Also the company has started making a sample center which did not explain what it was.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_00
 But I'm guessing that.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_00
 So they have a sample center and a sample speaker.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm guessing that the sample speaker is probably something like.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_00
 You know, as soon as you press a button, it.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_00
 It gives you feedback. One.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_00
 Five, whatever. Yeah, on.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_00
 And I don't know whether simple center has to do something with voice recognition or not.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_00
 But anyway, so these are the different options that we have.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so that's that's basically now.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_00
 I think that we can integrate.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_00
 You know, the user interface.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_00
 And the marketing things in that.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_00
 Keep taking out things from this and.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_02
 And lining things that are important.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_02
 Do you want to stay somewhere near the board so that if we need to.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you can sit down.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_02
 But we might need to delay.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_03
 And I have some PowerPoint.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_03
 To be honest, actually, I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit under under this talk.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_03
 This time, I mentioned the more idea in the previous talk.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_03
 So, yeah, this time, I might not have them on the slides, but I can just mention them again.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_03
 So I thought I would also include the definition of using interface.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_03
 So it's the aspects of a computer system or program which can be seen by the user.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_03
 And which the mechanism that the user uses to control his operation and input data.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_03
 So this would include things like shape and size and buttons and voice recognition as well.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_03
 And color and so on.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_03
 The method I employed this time was again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_03
 And then analyze them from the point of view of user friendliness and also whether their appearance was pleasant.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_03
 And then this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_03
 So some findings.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_03
 So in the case of many user interfaces, they are just so full of buttons that it's actually hard to find the ones you really want to use.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_03
 And it's just confusing.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_03
 It takes time to learn.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_03
 So I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. Some of them are here.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the picture is not very clear, but as you can see there are actually.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, sorry for that.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_03
 Let's go back.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, please.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_03
 So yeah, they are quite big and have many, many buttons.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, all these I personally prefer this one because it's the smallest and with the smallest number of buttons as well.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_03
 And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_03
 So let's carry on with this.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_03
 So other findings.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_03
 Some new things used.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_03
 Some of them were mentioned already by our technical designer.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_03
 Our own company has developed a new user interface.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_03
 Wait, no, this is not the one.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_03
 There is a, we can include voice recognition and it allows, it's possible to record 80 different voice samples on it.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_03
 So this one was already mentioned, the LCD display.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_03
 Another new development is a scroll button, which was also already mentioned.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_03
 And our own manufacturing division has designed a new programmable speech, sorry, a speaker unit I guess it should be.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_03
 And this means that it comes together with a voice recognition, but it's once the gadget recognizes the voice of the speaker, there can be pre-programmed answer.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_03
 For example, you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says hello and your name or whatever.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, this is also one of the new developments, we might consider if we wanted to.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_00
 Can you go back for a second.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_00
 Are you sure what this means, the spinning wheel with the LCD display?

0:14:57	SPEAKER_03
 It's like the, like you said, no, the scroll button is a different thing.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_03
 I have a picture, if you just a moment, I'll show you.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_03
 So I wasn't completely sure myself, but I think it's just like, it's a wheel, it's like not separate buttons.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_03
 Look, this one here, but I'm not really sure whether you can really turn it around.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_03
 It's like a press list or this.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe I part is like, you know how you have your mouse and you go around and it's kind of like that and you spin around and it.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_04
 So instead of going down, you just spin around and it's a bit weird at first, but it's actually very like fast.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_04
 Like the wheels that click on the side, you get a much slower, so it's quite good if you're like searching quite a lot of stuff.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_04
 I know, if you're looking, you're going through the A to Z of your music and you're looking for something at T.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_04
 Then it's a lot faster than the wheel, but you've got a lot less control over.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_00
 So I just want to include that here as well, series plus spinning.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, and the personal preference is pretty much the same as last time.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_03
 It has to be small, simple.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, we decided to include voice recognition.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_03
 So the standard major buttons like gone off, the channels and then volume.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_03
 And then there has to be a menu on the screen.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_03
 And I also thought if we want to put it small and nice, and actually I quite like the idea of a scrolling button for voice like, I don't know, like on movements or something.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_03
 I think there is no reason why we can use something like this for the remote control.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_03
 So yeah, let's expand.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, straight to trends and then we can discuss it all at once.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_01
 I can't really add a little bit of vibration.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_01
 If you take a bus do that.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, cool.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_04
 What I do is search the inserts, come up with market trends.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_04
 And you know what users are going to be wanting in the near future.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_04
 Right? No, the first aspect is probably twice as important as the second aspect, which is twice as important as the third aspect.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_04
 So I mean the easy to use thing is fairly low down on there, which I think giving the target group is what you would expect.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_04
 You know, people want something new, something technologically innovative and different.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_04
 So the whole idea with the LCDs and the spinning and the colors and the voice recognition is quite like quite the thing to go for.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_04
 And yeah, it will just look frankly.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe as you're discussing things, is it okay if we just keep highlighting things here?

0:18:48	SPEAKER_00
 So it could put.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_00
 Probably voice recognition is kind of important.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe the LCD and the.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_00
 I have a point about LCD.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_00
 LCDs are basically for feedback to the user who is pressing buttons.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_00
 And the feedback can come through the television itself.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_04
 Do we need an LCD on the remote?

0:19:15	SPEAKER_04
 I think we've got one of those tell you our spot and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to TV and then you wait and then it comes.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_04
 So it actually takes quite a long time.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_04
 If you get the number wrong, then it's a bit of a pain.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_04
 So I think you know a screen on the remote would probably get down any time and that.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_04
 But like we don't just do tend to get thrown out of it.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_02
 It is also quite nice though to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_04
 That's true.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_04
 It would be like if you could make it integrate with the TV then it could come up with your information about what's on and you could just see that on the remote rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_04
 But I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_04
 You know like you have the slide you want and you have the flip you want and then the screen is protected so it doesn't actually get scratched.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_04
 So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control or like a minimalist remote control so you've got your buttons one to nine, you're on and off and you're volume on that.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_04
 And then you want to mess about it, you flip it open and.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_00
 Okay so now we seem to have a consensus that LCDs are definitely the way to go because of style and.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah so that kind of decides your whole chip thing.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_00
 You agree?

0:20:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yep.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_00
 So.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_04
 Apparently we should be writing inspiration so I just give it a heart.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_04
 So these will be an important feature for clothes shoes and furniture.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_04
 So I mean I'm taking this to mean you know carving us.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_04
 Do you know because you don't tend to get flat vegetables.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_04
 Possibly even and even.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_04
 That would be a good way to get in the whole RSI issue and.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_04
 Because I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand right hands that you want to.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_04
 You carve it so that it's suitable for you.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_00
 Rubber.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_00
 Rubber.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_00
 But.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_00
 It's with.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_00
 With using.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_04
 I suppose you will get a right.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_02
 And it help if you drop it.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_02
 It protects it as well.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_00
 So if we use latex cases they won't allow us to use solar cells.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_00
 We could use titanium, wood or.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_02
 Or if we want to use the latex then we have to go with one of the other.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_04
 We should get the kinetic energy fairly easily.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_04
 So probably double curved surface is the way to go.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_00
 Or curved at one end and flat on the top.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_00
 Because I'm not sure if it is flat on both sides.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_00
 Then how much easy would it be to reach for buttons etc.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_04
 It depends on the whole.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_00
 It's like how you put your hammer so you can reach it in the middle.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_04
 Single side curved or double side curved does not say too much does it.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_04
 No, I don't think it makes a lot of difference.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_04
 I have one of those slightly fainted.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_04
 I mean the back is essentially straight but it's curved.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_04
 One side is straight.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_04
 And you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just to be curved but things.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_00
 Did it say anywhere in your research material about this lighting stuff?

0:23:23	SPEAKER_00
 Because I call it the intuition that I have I think the only options that we have with the cases are the E3.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_00
 Either you have a lot of surface to the case or a curved surface case.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_00
 Does not say anything about whether technically this stuff is available at all.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_04
 This is more about the protection of the LCD.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_04
 Which I think is very kind of on.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_04
 My research can tell me anything which is why we have all the pictures.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_04
 That is the beauty with my time.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_04
 We got.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_04
 Combined style with the level of functionality.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_04
 Beauty and price quality.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_02
 So looking at what we've got.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_02
 We want to now display with a spinning wheel.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_00
 Let's try to rub off things.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_00
 So hand animals are definitely out.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_00
 You are not.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_02
 That's not streamlined and sexy having a wind up.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's really good.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's the kind of kind of a.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's not the practicality of a release.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_00
 As against a watch which constantly keeps moving this thing will have to be tapped every time.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_00
 Which might be very frustrating for the user.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_02
 Depends how much.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_02
 How much.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_02
 The movement really needs.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if they're suggesting it.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_00
 Then what could be.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_00
 The flat completely flat case is definitely out.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_00
 It has to be at least up.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_01
 Not very strong.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_00
 We still have all the options.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_00
 Would you think would.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_03
 I can't.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_03
 How do you.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, you can't keep it really small.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_03
 You can't make it like thin and.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_03
 You need to put all the technology in.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_03
 If the case, you add the case.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_00
 If it is really.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_00
 It's a bit bulky.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_00
 If it is really thin, it's likely to break.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's much more.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_02
 Given that we're looking at more spongy material preferences.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_02
 Would think.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I would.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_04
 It's not very clean.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_04
 That's true.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_04
 It's not practical.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_04
 It's quite for a table, but for a microphone.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_04
 And splinters and stuff.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_04
 It does make me sense.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_03
 In the case of remote control, more really.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_00
 Now for the really interesting stuff, the interface.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_00
 So the push buttons is our expertise in the industry.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_00
 But it seems to be out of trend.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_00
 You know, nobody.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I think for the channel numbers, you still need them.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_03
 What do you?

0:26:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_00
 So for channel numbers.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_00
 If we have LCD displays that opens up a whole world.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_00
 You know, if you have an LCD display, then you can stack almost everything on the LCD display.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I think the LCD display is kind of, yeah, it's faster.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_03
 And when we discuss that we might like this flipping open thing, then I mean, you can use it as a normal remote control.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_03
 But if you do want to use LCD, then you'll flip it open, but it's more time consuming.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_04
 I think this is getting back to the graph at the beginning.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_04
 I made where, you know, the buttons, the people use all the time.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_04
 You want buttons for them.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_00
 And everything else.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_00
 Many don't.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_00
 So in the buttons we have, for the channels also, we have options.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_00
 Do we enumerate everything from 0 to 9?

0:27:06	SPEAKER_00
 Or do we have just a channel plus channel minus just?

0:27:10	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, we definitely need the numbers because otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_02
 Do we need them as buttons?

0:27:19	SPEAKER_00
 Or do we need them as LCD?

0:27:20	SPEAKER_00
 On the LCD we can, you know.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I would say buttons because it's...

0:27:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_04
 It is.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_04
 So, I think the thing is, so if someone just wants to turn on the TV and put on a channel, then it should be easier to use.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_04
 And then any of them are made.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_04
 And then if someone wants to, you know, change the contest on their TV and...

0:27:43	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_04
 They should be able to do that and it should be accessible.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_04
 But, you know, I mean, most of the time, I mean, there's a limit to how much the biggest technology can spend fiddling with the TV.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's the issue.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_00
 So, buttons definitely.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_00
 But, okay.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_00
 Shall we try to draw our...

0:28:01	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's what you guys are going to do next.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_02
 So, if we put down the key...

0:28:06	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_00
 So, components.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_00
 So, what about the scrolling?

0:28:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I'm not completely clear.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, about the spinning wheel.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think it doesn't make sense to have both, like, a scrolling and spinning thing.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_03
 You cannot include everything in the spinning wheel.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_03
 If you've just spinning it and not spinning it.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_04
 And I would say that the spinning goes at a higher speed to the scrolling wheel.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_04
 So, you have to decide whether you want to be going to say fast or not.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_04
 But, I mean, the thing with this whole...

0:28:40	SPEAKER_04
 You're planning on making it out of rubber on the basis that it's spun me.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_04
 And I'm not sure how well the scrolling wheel would work.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_02
 But if you've got a flip thing, effectively, it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_02
 But you've folded it in half.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but you're spinning wheel tends to go to one side.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think so too.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, the case would be rubbed on the buttons.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_00
 Or at the corner of the edges.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_00
 Just the edges covered by rubber or something like that.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_00
 Everything else in plastic or even titanium if you want to use it.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_04
 Or maybe, like, interchangeable cases.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_04
 Because I know, like, we're going back to iPods again, the whole spinning wheel.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_04
 But I have, like, obviously, iPods not made in rubber.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_04
 Then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_04
 And I can change the color theoretically to match my outfit.

0:29:33	None
 Right.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so that gives us a more trendy look as well.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think the spinning wheel is definitely very narrow.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_00
 That's right.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's right.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_00
 So rub that out.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_00
 And colors can be provided with the case rather than...

0:29:58	SPEAKER_00
 But we still need to think about the color offer mode as such.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think it was a requirement that we use.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_03
 The colors of our company, so would it be like yellow, grey and black or something?

0:30:11	SPEAKER_03
 I guess.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_04
 That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable team bananas.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_03
 Bananas?

0:30:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yellow?

0:30:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, definitely.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, do you think we could incorporate the colors of the company into the buttons and then make the color of the main remote, the color like vegetable colors, you know?

0:30:26	SPEAKER_04
 So you could have like, I mean, I suppose vegetable colors would be orange, green and some reds and maybe purple and then you'd paint with buttons and company colors to match.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, if you go over to the integrated circuits, since we are having LCDs, there's no way that we will be able to.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_00
 What we do need to consider, however, is that the price is going up with every such thing that we are considering.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_00
 But since LCDs seems to be a definite yes, so it seems to be one idea where we would want to spend.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_00
 So rub off the other two.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_04
 So we discounting solar energy because what was going to be used in there somewhere, or that was the...

0:31:16	SPEAKER_00
 So the constraint was...

0:31:18	SPEAKER_00
 We can't have solar panels with rubber.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_04
 So yeah, okay, so we lose that, I think.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_02
 Should we go for... if we're going for rubber, we think of it as our case.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_02
 And then...

0:31:33	SPEAKER_03
 And the buttons as well, I think?

0:31:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think we'll have...

0:31:40	SPEAKER_00
 Using simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, although it does seem interesting, but it does not hold any advantages as well.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's just a kinetic...

0:31:58	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so we understand this better now that the speaker is for the feedback, right?

0:32:04	SPEAKER_00
 It says the things that you type in or something like that.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:32:10	SPEAKER_02
 I think if we can include them at not too much extra cost, then I'd put them in.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_00
 We don't have too much information about it.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I think it should be quite cheap because it's from the company.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_00
 It's from the company.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so this isn't as well then.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_02
 And the case is curved on one side, but then flat on the top.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_02
 So it's flipped into each other.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_02
 Can I pull the...

0:32:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, sure.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_02
 Can I pull the...

0:32:54	SPEAKER_01
 Just so I can...

0:32:57	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry, I just...

0:33:01	SPEAKER_02
 Nothing gets far.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_04
 What is ICIC?

0:33:13	SPEAKER_00
 ICICs? Integrated circuits?

0:33:15	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_04
 So it's advanced integrated circuits?

0:33:20	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_00
 We're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as on CDs.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:32	None
 Okay.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_02
 So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery, the advanced chip.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_02
 And curved on one side case, which is folded in on itself, made out of rubber.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_02
 And buttons are also rubber.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_02
 We're having push buttons on the outside.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_02
 And then on the inside and LCD with spinning wheel, we're incorporating voice recognition.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_02
 That's how I've all contacted it.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_02
 And it's going to look sort of vegetal.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_02
 And being bright, vegetal colours.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_03
 So would we have the spinning wheel inside with the LCD or would it be on the older?

0:34:37	SPEAKER_04
 Imagine it would be inside.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_04
 So actually that could really cut down your thing.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_04
 So you've got your outside, which is minimalist, and then you open it up.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_04
 You've got a screen and a spinning wheel which you can incorporate buttons in to.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_04
 So you still not got a lot of stuff in there.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_04
 You've maybe got, you know, like if you're modelling on iPod, you've got five buttons and a wheel.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_04
 And four buttons are in the wheel.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_04
 And the other one's a little bit inside the wheel.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_02
 So now we've got 30 minutes before our next meeting.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_02
 In the meantime, the industrial designer over here is going to work on the look and feel design, which I presume will work out what comes.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_02
 The user interface designer will work on the user interface design.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_02
 And the marketing expert is going to work on productive evaluation.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_02
 And as well as that, the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling plates.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_02
 And you will get extra instructions from your personal coach.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_02
 Is that all okay?

0:35:54	SPEAKER_02
 And anyone who hasn't put their presentation in the project document folder, it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it.

0:36:06	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to go and sell my in.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_04
 Nobody wants to talk to me.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_03
 Shall I move away first or shall I say here?

0:36:20	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_03
 I would care.
