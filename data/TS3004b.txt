0:06:46	SPEAKER_04
 M maybe we could make a clap system.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_04
 So when you clap your hands it will beep, or something.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_04
 You must find it quickly.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe just a button on the home station.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_01
 So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_04
 And we can combine that.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_04
 It takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_04
 I think we must take a look at this.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_04
 It's only 34% because if we make a world new product our own style, this is so difficult.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_04
 Next, remote control is also bad for AirZ.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_04
 But only if they accept a lot and they watch over 5 hours TV or something.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_04
 â€¦aah, we haven't, we mustn't look too much at the last point.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_04
 OK, last page.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_04
 The last experiment was about gadgets, like speech recognition.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_04
 We didn't think about that already.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_04
 And an LCD on the remote control.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_04
 We already talked about that.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_04
 And they finally had a conclusion that younger people, under an age of 45, are more interested in new features.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_04
 But they are more critical.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_04
 And older people want to spend more money.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_04
 But they don't want to have a lot of new features, because they are in their old thinking way.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_04
 And they want to keep the old things, the old things.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_03
 So we have a new age for 4-bit.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_04
 But you already said that the company was about 40 plus clients.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_03
 So we just can skip the LCD on the remote control.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_04
 I think we can skip speech recognition directly, because it's not reachable for 25 euros.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_04
 And then I have my personal preference.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_04
 OK, that's not very good, because I thought about the television DVD plays the area, and Fiji are the question about.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_04
 But it's already out of the question.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_04
 My point is, well, if we make remote control for only television, I think it's hard to sell it for 25 euros, but it's the exercise.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_03
 It's too expensive.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, only for television.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_04
 On the market you can now buy for 20 euros a remote control for everything.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_04
 And we only make it for television, so we must make it very special.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, good usability, so you can use it.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_04
 OK, I talked about the home station.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_04
 It must be simple, because the elderly people need to use it.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_04
 And I found the motto, and we put the fashion in electronics.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_04
 And that's the motto we are referenced for our style.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_04
 We have to make a new product.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_04
 We have to be...

0:10:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_04
 Wonderful kind.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_03
 So it has to look...

0:10:08	SPEAKER_04
 The company is about their own fashion, their own style.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_03
 But old people are not looking for that.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I think...

0:10:16	SPEAKER_01
 Not really.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_02
 I think the main thing is usability.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_02
 That's when we can make a special product.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_01
 Keep it simple, we also have to stand out, because there are already, like you said, so many controls out that support a lot of stuff.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_01
 But we have to make sure that we're better in usability and stand out by just looks at it.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_01
 So make it just a different color or different shape.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_04
 OK, this was my presentation.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_04
 OK.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_03
 So Paul, you can do the right one first.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_03
 It's on the net.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_03
 There is.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_01
 Technical functions design.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_01
 OK, well, we have a broad audience.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_01
 That isn't true anymore, but we have elderly people, so we need to keep it simple.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_01
 The way I want to keep it simple is to use the standards.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_01
 So the standardized methods, like on all remote controls.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_01
 Not to fool, like Jens already said, only 10% is being used.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_03
 So what do you think of only the numbers and the off button?

0:11:40	SPEAKER_01
 We have to do the next page, but yes, basic functions, like numbers and that sort of stuff.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_01
 So the option is that we put on there should be eased used, because you have more room than, and for elderly people, big buttons, an icon on it or a text on it, so it's very clear what that button does.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_01
 So it doesn't take much time to figure out how to use it.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_01
 A way to find out what people use.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe just use questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people, elderly people.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_01
 What they use, what they want on remote control to find out.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_01
 But there was already one done.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_01
 Well, functions I could think of volume channels.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_01
 The basic I call it numpad.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 So I call it a text service option.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_01
 Basic on off.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_01
 And I found it, could I think of favorites?

0:12:47	SPEAKER_01
 I always look up the same pages on text and I always have to click the number.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 What if you could make a new option that you just have to press one button and you get on your...

0:12:59	SPEAKER_02
 So remember what favorite is what channel, so you might as well remember the number.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_03
 No, maybe it's too complicated, I'm not sure.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it's a good idea.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_01
 It was just a thought, so I would find it handy, I think, when you just press one button and you get on 666.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay, but how can you remember what channel connects to what favorite button?

0:13:27	SPEAKER_01
 I was reading on the page, I'm writing a full just since command, basic commands to the television.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_01
 So switch to channel 6.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_01
 So a button 6 says 6.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_01
 And if you make favorites, it can say 666 in a row.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_01
 Just numbers.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay, but for a user to remember, if I press that button, it goes to that channel.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_02
 Well, if you set a favorite.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but isn't it hard to remember?

0:13:57	SPEAKER_02
 Like favorite one.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_03
 For me, if I use my telephone, I never use those buttons to question.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_03
 No, neither do I.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, now maybe not.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_03
 If I don't do it, maybe old people.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe old people.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, they don't like new features, so maybe not.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_01
 Well, play pause.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_01
 And I know that it's useful.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_01
 It's not anymore for TV.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 Right, I don't know.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_01
 Did I miss any other buttons, basic buttons?

0:14:33	SPEAKER_01
 I couldn't think of any other, especially not for TV.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_03
 Just on the front as well.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_03
 No, that's only the only thing you need.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_02
 The next and previous, previous I know, but next channel.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_01
 Just a channel, what I mean is that.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_02
 Like a web browser.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_02
 But there's also a button to go to the channel you've been before.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_02
 Like a web browser.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_01
 Back button.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_01
 I don't have.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I know what it is, but I think it's all the difficulties.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_01
 You used that when you want to go to.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, just use when you want to switch between channels all the time.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we want to do it like if you have a channel above 10.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_03
 Normally you can press one.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think, especially for older people, you use standard buttons.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_01
 So you have that.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_01
 The 10 plus button.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the 10 plus button.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_01
 Just one one pressing or quickly after each other.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_01
 Just to keep it simple and standard features.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, wouldn't it be a problem to, because you have to be fast enough.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe the elderly people.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_01
 But I think that's in the TV as well.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_01
 That's how the TV handle the bit.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_01
 You can have a button that says.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's not.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_00
 It's not that.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_01
 So you have like a.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but that's the second's very add to press those two buttons.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_04
 It's what Paul says.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_04
 It's not remote control.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_04
 That.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_04
 That makes the TV.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_04
 Do one to it's the TV.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_04
 Who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one seconds that you must type one.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_01
 So if you have a universal TV controller, you need that one button that has two stripes.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_01
 So you have a period of, I don't know, five seconds to press those buttons in that.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_01
 No for elderly people to look.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_01
 One, two, press and aim and.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_03
 But do we still need the two level remote control because if you only have that.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_01
 It's only for television now.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think so.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_01
 I just thought of another one.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_01
 Most things in modern TV are also under menu.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_01
 Do we also need a menu button.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_01
 And then a navigation.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_01
 But we can integrate that with volume and previous the next.

0:16:58	None
 So you have.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_02
 I think you really have to divide between functions you often use.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_02
 Like maybe switch channels and volume and good at kind of things.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_02
 And the menu button because you almost never use menu button.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_03
 But maybe it's still still a good idea.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_03
 You would have to use a mute button to.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_01
 A mute button.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe I don't know where you have to put it.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's, I think that's the latest type.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_01
 You just now have to figure out what's, what's it put on.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_01
 What we can use.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_01
 And later we can do the design.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_01
 Now my personal preference is using the standards.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_01
 Basic.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_01
 I think that we should stand out unique.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_01
 Being unique with the design.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_01
 So we have to, I don't know, make a different shape than usual.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_01
 So when you are in the shop and you see our TV control hanging that it stands out.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_01
 Not just in a row.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_01
 And you see all the same.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_03
 You know, same remote controls.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_03
 It has to be, it has to be a different color.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know, different colors.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we can give it out in different colors.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_04
 You can choose.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_04
 You like an dynamic or something.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_04
 No, why not?

0:18:20	SPEAKER_04
 Or that's fancy.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_04
 That's a.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_03
 It looks cheap as well because it's a small thing.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_03
 It's only 24 of yours.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_03
 It looks very cheap if you make it.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_01
 Well, maybe we can look at mobile phones.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, you just, I don't know what happened.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we have to look at mobile phones.

0:18:35	None
 That's right.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_03
 The design very well.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_01
 And, well, basically, are the same, just a bit smaller.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_01
 You think you can't make it if you control too small.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_01
 Because then you will always lose it.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_01
 But, well, I think that's a good example.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, you have to hurry up a bit because I don't know what to make.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_01
 You finished again.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_02
 Well, the working design.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_02
 The method I use is search the web.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_02
 Just a web page provided.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_02
 Basically, I'm not very technical educated, but I could figure it out.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_02
 Basically, what happens is you press a button.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_02
 Then the circuit gets closed by pressing the button, like a switch.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_02
 And by closing that certain circuit, Chip knows what button is pressed.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_02
 So, like, you press a one, that circuit is closed.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_02
 And then the Chip produces a pattern, like a Morse code, and sends that to the LED.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_02
 That's the light emitting diet, I think.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_02
 And the light emitting diet is producing infrared light.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_02
 That's invisible to the human eye, and transmit that to the TV.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_02
 However, there's also a visible diet.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_02
 That's blinking red, if you look in it.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_02
 And that's another diet, I believe, because infrared is not visible.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_02
 So, that's two different things.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_03
 So, we also have to have a LED.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think so.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if it's the same thing.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's just to indicate that it's active.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_03
 Or just the green one, because if you use it, it's green, or the red.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, maybe I think it's in the case that it's active.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, when you press it.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_04
 So, the red is just...

0:21:08	SPEAKER_03
 The red shows up like something's wrong, and green is like, it's okay.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_02
 Almost remote controls is red.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, we make it one.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_01
 So, maybe we don't have to make red.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe integrate it into the design as well.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, if the whole remote control becomes green, if you press the button.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_03
 That's cool.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_02
 I think the batteries will be...

0:21:36	SPEAKER_02
 Now we have a little recharge.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_01
 If you can still make that.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't have to be red, it's just to indicate something.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that is working.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_02
 Not the batteries are low.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_02
 It's not very important.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, just to indicate it's working.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_02
 And the receptor in the TV senses the pattern.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_02
 So, we have to understand what patterns are used to make it universal.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_02
 So, that can be used with all the TVs.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_02
 And we have to really understand what patterns are used.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_02
 So, we can...

0:22:11	SPEAKER_02
 Otherwise, it won't work.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_01
 So, we have to make buttons for that as well.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_02
 No, the chip is producing the pattern.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_02
 So, we have to make a chip that produces patterns to...

0:22:28	SPEAKER_04
 An automatic search function for each television.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, or I don't know exactly how it works.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_02
 It wasn't explained there.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I use a universal remote control.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_01
 And before we end, you have a list of all the TVs you have, etc.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_01
 And you have to put in a number.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_04
 So, it works on your TV.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, I have a modern one.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_04
 And the modern one.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_04
 You type a search.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_04
 And the lead became to Blink.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_04
 Blink, Blink.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_04
 And after a short time, the television turns off.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_04
 And then you know, oh, it's the right one.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_04
 And you can stop it.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_04
 And then it's OK.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_04
 So, you don't have to search for your television or your code.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_04
 It's the search pattern for itself.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, yeah.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_02
 So, we have to make a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_02
 Because you have to...

0:23:24	SPEAKER_03
 Can you just say it again?

0:23:26	SPEAKER_03
 Because I was just looking at this.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, sure.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_02
 Well, you have this chip.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_02
 And it's because when the circuit is closed, it produces the pattern.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_02
 But basically for brands of TV, these patterns are different.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_02
 So, like when you press a one on one TV, it goes to one.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_02
 And on another TV, it won't work, basically.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_02
 So, basically, what you have to do is get these patterns right.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_02
 And that can be done by just changing the signal.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, changing the signal.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, changing the pattern all the time.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_02
 And what he's doing when he's configuring this pattern, this chip, is trying to switch off the television.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_02
 And when it's switched off, you can push your button.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_02
 It's working now.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_02
 And then he saves that setting.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_02
 And then he's working.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's the right option.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_02
 Well, the components.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, this is a bit technical.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_02
 And I hadn't, I was a little short on time.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_02
 But I think I understand it.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_02
 The energy source is the battery, basically.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_02
 That's connecting to all the components.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_02
 Because it has to be fed with energy.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, the subcomponent is, I think it is the button pressed.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_02
 So, basically, when you press a button, a switch gets closed.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_02
 And that's connecting to a chip.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_02
 So, the chip knows what button you pressed.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_02
 And the chip sends out the pattern to the infrared bulb.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't put the description by this one.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_02
 So, the normal flashing lights.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_02
 So, that's the LED.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_02
 And this is the LED too.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_02
 But this one is producing infrared light.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_02
 It's invisible.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_02
 And this one is producing normal light.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_03
 So, we can make the normal one also a normal light.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_03
 Another LED light is a normal one.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_03
 Flash up your...

0:25:41	SPEAKER_04
 If you use the buttons, both of them works.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_04
 But one you can't see.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_04
 And one indicates that you use a button.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. Because when you press a button and it doesn't work, it can basically, if the battery is low, it won't work.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_02
 So, you have to indicate that it's...

0:25:59	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you have to put a small light around the button you push.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_03
 So, you see green if you push that button.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's a necessary power.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_04
 You use that.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe if you do that, you know that you're sending a signal.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_03
 And it's...

0:26:15	SPEAKER_03
 You also know which button.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_04
 And the whole remote control, I have to be...

0:26:18	SPEAKER_04
 Let's.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's right.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_03
 Everywhere and there.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_03
 Does it make any difference for the energy you use?

0:26:25	SPEAKER_03
 You still want that.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it will look different.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_01
 And I think we need to find something else.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_01
 It looks different, yeah.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_01
 Because otherwise we will just make another standard.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_01
 And our motto also is...

0:26:38	SPEAKER_04
 Just let's beneath the buttons.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_01
 Around the buttons.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_01
 Or in the buttons, even.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but like when you push it...

0:26:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, then the one that is here.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you have your finger over the button.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_02
 So you can see...

0:26:54	SPEAKER_02
 You must be around in there.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_02
 Or maybe on top of the green light splashing on.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_04
 Not here.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_04
 But here.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, there.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe here.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_03
 The same as a telephone or a mobile phone or...

0:27:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we're thinking about that.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_01
 If you're a mobile phone in the dark...

0:27:12	SPEAKER_01
 Light-set, everything lights up.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it only takes a little energy.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's a mobile phone.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_01
 And the phone can do it.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, maybe that's a good idea for all people as well.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, if you were in the dark, you can't see the numbers.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's only a few letters or any four or something.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_03
 Four letters.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_01
 No, I don't know.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_01
 But if we use a battery station, which I think we'll use.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's a good idea.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we'll have enough power to...

0:27:39	SPEAKER_03
 Everything everyone agrees with that or...

0:27:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we'll pause it on the home station.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_04
 I bet you'll call your remote control.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_03
 But you have to make it sound devised in it.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, there must be sound in it.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, maybe it's that little too hard to make...

0:28:02	SPEAKER_02
 Especially for that kind of money.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_02
 It has to be...

0:28:06	SPEAKER_02
 The production cost is 12.5.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_04
 12.5, okay.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_04
 But we only have to make it for television.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_01
 We must have something special.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_01
 We also have...

0:28:18	SPEAKER_01
 Remote controls with a lot of options.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_01
 But we lose about 90% of those options.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_01
 So I think you can...

0:28:26	SPEAKER_04
 You have to give customers some extra.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_01
 I think we will save money with that.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, you're almost finished.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the personal preference I didn't fill it out.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_02
 Because it was sure on time.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_02
 But basically what we could do too is have a Bluetooth integration.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I just wanted to talk to some about some more.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe you...

0:28:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:51	None
 Okay.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:29:04	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, sorry.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_03
 What's that?

0:29:12	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:29:13	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, sorry.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_03
 We have some new project requirements.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_03
 We have to have a look what they are.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_03
 Still...

0:29:23	SPEAKER_03
 Teletext has become outdated since the popularity of Internet.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_03
 So a Teletext option.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we have to skip that one.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think so.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_02
 I think a lot of people use Teletext.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's on your televisions, only one button.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_03
 We definitely should use it.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I told you the remote control should only be used for a televisions.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_03
 So that's maybe easier.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_03
 And the 40 plus people already told you.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, no, sorry.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, this is a problem.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, sorry about that.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_03
 The new product should reach a new market with customers or the young enough 40.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_03
 So it should be flashy or just...

0:30:07	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, interesting.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry about that, I just didn't read it.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_03
 So did you make some...

0:30:14	SPEAKER_03
 Chash...

0:30:15	SPEAKER_03
 Chash about that?

0:30:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that kind of changed the whole situation.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, then we have to make some nice features.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_01
 I think the thing in the dark is a good way to make more...

0:30:28	SPEAKER_01
 More like mobile phone.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_01
 More modern.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_01
 That's important, I think.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_04
 LCD doesn't work for 12.5 euros, I think.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_01
 Don't think it's very usable in remote control, especially when you only have TV functions on it.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think you'll use it often because you can see on the television what channel you...

0:30:52	SPEAKER_04
 Watching that channel one.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think that's not usable now.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_01
 So, but...

0:31:01	SPEAKER_01
 What other features can we put in?

0:31:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_02
 I think you have to make it a bit flashy and popular.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_02
 And then the usability is not that required because like in the mobile phones, usability is not that good, I think.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_04
 Some of you had something to read about speech recognition, about you said one and the television turns on one.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_04
 Is that reachable, maybe?

0:31:30	SPEAKER_04
 That's fair.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_04
 That's easy, that's cool.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_04
 It's 12, for each one.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_04
 Only the numbers, only numbers, furthermore nothing, but only the numbers, one to 20 or something.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_04
 That should be cool.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, maybe we have to integrate that as well.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_03
 If it's possible.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_03
 If it's possible, I don't know.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know. I don't think it's very expensive actually.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_03
 You only have for microphone.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_02
 It has to work.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_02
 And does it have to work only in English or in Dutch too?

0:31:59	SPEAKER_04
 No, maybe.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_04
 Ah, that's a problem.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_02
 And...

0:32:02	SPEAKER_02
 I only know English.

0:32:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know how to speak in Dutch or...

0:32:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's probably my job to figure that out.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_01
 I can use cream from wherever.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_01
 One.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know. We have to think about that, but do we do it?

0:32:18	SPEAKER_01
 No, I don't know.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_01
 If we do it.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_01
 Is it very usable?

0:32:21	SPEAKER_01
 That's what I'm looking at.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_02
 And do you have to speak in like anything or...

0:32:26	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it's too hard to realize that.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_03
 We have short time to put it on the market.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_03
 So that you have to do a lot of testing before we can do that.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, thanks.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_02
 You can make it...

0:32:37	SPEAKER_03
 You can make the remote control very flexible.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_04
 Indeed, the languages are a difficult thing.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_04
 Because we...

0:32:44	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if it's useful enough to take the effort to design something with speech recognition.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_02
 And also, if you have a good speech recognition, you can just throw the...

0:32:59	SPEAKER_04
 Someone says...

0:33:00	SPEAKER_04
 The remote control.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_04
 Give me one code.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_04
 And the TV turns on to one.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_01
 It's not to go out of the electromagnetic.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_01
 But then you have to say a TV channel one.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_00
 Not just one.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_04
 But TV one.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_04
 That becomes...

0:33:14	SPEAKER_04
 Because that's very hard for speech recognition.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you know, but I don't think it's just an useful enough.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_03
 So we have to make some decisions.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_03
 So you can see on the...

0:33:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, no speech recognition.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_03
 So we have to know what we're going to put on.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_03
 Do we make a light under the...

0:33:32	SPEAKER_03
 Under the numbers and everything?

0:33:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_03
 If you press something, it lights up for a few seconds.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_03
 You can see what other buttons there are.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay?

0:33:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's good.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, we just take that one.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_01
 And what else we do?

0:33:45	SPEAKER_01
 Also the one in the dark.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:33:48	SPEAKER_01
 Light's up when it's dark.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I thought that would be the same if you push something.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it doesn't work all the time.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't work only when you use it.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_03
 Are you going to switch it on or something?

0:34:01	SPEAKER_03
 No, if you use one button, it must turn on for 20 seconds.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's right.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_00
 It's the same as a telephone.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, all right.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_03
 And do we use a...

0:34:13	SPEAKER_03
 What's it called?

0:34:15	SPEAKER_03
 Like an iMac, and if you can look through it, or just normal.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it's an option.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it's an option.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_01
 Like we discussed like iPod, different colors, maybe use even different fonts.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_01
 Like a phone.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_03
 Different colors, okay?

0:34:30	SPEAKER_01
 So you just make it...

0:34:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's cool.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_01
 As an option, maybe.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_03
 And so the buttons we have...

0:34:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, this is normal.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_03
 We put in the simple buttons on the top, and probably the more complicated buttons.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but there's a lot of different buttons.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_01
 We don't really have any...

0:34:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, maybe you have...

0:34:48	SPEAKER_03
 You have to...

0:34:49	SPEAKER_03
 When you use teletext, you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one, or to go to the previous one.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think the buttons are very easy, with just standard buttons.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_03
 But maybe you can put the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control,

0:35:07	SPEAKER_01
 because you almost never use it. Teletext options are only for buttons or something.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but younger people, I think, more often use the internet, and elderly people often use teletext.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's right.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_04
 I use teletexts every day, I think.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, for me too.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_03
 So we just give it one level, then.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah, one level.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_01
 And I think, because we don't have that many buttons, I think the design is most important.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_01
 You can integrate the buttons in the design very much, because the door is simple buttons.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_01
 If you put one above it, it's clear.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_03
 So that's it for...

0:35:48	SPEAKER_03
 We're going to have a lunch break.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_03
 How long is lunch break?

0:35:57	SPEAKER_03
 So yeah, you know what you have to do with this.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_03
 This is it.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_03
 You get your meal and everything.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_04
 Trans-watching, okay?

0:36:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:36:08	None
 That's fun.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yo.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_03
 So we finished work for this time.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_03
 We can just move in.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_00
 Bye.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we need to go to the bathroom.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_04
 I think the office is over there.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_02
 We can eat something.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we can eat lunch.

0:36:48	None
 Yeah.

0:36:50	None
 Have you seen this?

0:36:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I've seen it a lot of times.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_03
 I think you can see the frame.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you have a leg in the middle.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_04
 Do you have a leg?

0:37:02	None
 Yeah, we're going to the bathroom.

0:37:05	None
 Okay.

0:37:15	None
 Okay.
