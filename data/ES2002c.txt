0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 to know is decide what a fulfill what yourself is.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:00:05	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:00:06	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_01
 It kind of does make sense doesn't it?

0:00:08	SPEAKER_01
 Because when we get into the end of meeting, we're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background.

0:00:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I agree.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_05
 Everything I have is kind of background.

0:00:15	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, we're all ready to do.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_05
 We'll have it in this meeting then.

0:00:19	SPEAKER_05
 If we, well, just recap on the minutes from the last meeting.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_05
 We decided on our target group being 15 to 35.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_05
 We decided that it was going to be normally a chargeable battery part that we're going to group our audio, visual and other functions into these categories.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_05
 And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext, ignoring everything except the TV and trying to incorporate the corporate color and slogan.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_05
 Start with the last meeting.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_05
 Is there anything I've ever gotten anything?

0:01:02	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_05
 Everything's okay.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_05
 So if we have these three presentations and then if we have anything to kind of know you're going to want to discuss, maybe just make a note of it and then we'll have all the discussion at the end.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_05
 I want you to have that idea this time.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_05
 So if we start off with Andrew and then Craig and then Davis, is that all right?

0:01:25	SPEAKER_05
 And then after that we'll have to make some decisions.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_05
 I'll like stop.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_05
 So I don't know how to get that.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_05
 Take this.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_05
 What would it be like to speak to our international?

0:01:50	SPEAKER_05
 Should we say we're going to try maybe incorporate it but we haven't made it up in the decision on that.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_05
 Or should also point out that the kind of the final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_05
 So that's kind of the end result.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:02:12	None
 All right.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_01
 So could it function F8?

0:02:14	SPEAKER_01
 Uh-huh.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_01
 Can you pair me with that one?

0:02:16	SPEAKER_01
 Come on.

0:02:17	None
 I think it's working.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, there we go.

0:02:19	None
 Okay, great.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_05
 So we just start now.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, great.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_01
 So, um, let's move on.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_04
 Uh-huh.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, where did I go?

0:02:44	SPEAKER_01
 It's not good.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, let me just see where I find it.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_01
 I think I just opened up the template.

0:02:55	None
 Okay.

0:02:56	None
 All right.

0:02:57	None
 So let's have a look here.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_01
 So this is the method that I've taken.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_01
 Basically what I want to do here before we get into it too far.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_01
 I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_01
 And then sort of go through some other way that I've dealt with that information and then sort of bring us all together and do it to see how this fits in with the overall vision.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_01
 Um, so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarize it for us.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_01
 And then I identify trends that are sort of in sync and are important to our, our, uh, project plan that we have so far.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_01
 And then initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sort of helps us to to narrow in on aspects that will inform other, uh, other elements of the project.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_01
 Does that make sense?

0:03:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_01
 That sort of strategy.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_01
 I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_01
 So that's why I suggest we get in.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_01
 So out of different figures and ratings of people in general, um, consumers in general, the number one thing that was found was that, uh, the television remote control of a fancy look and feel, okay, and not specify not a functional look or feel, um, fancy.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_01
 Um, however, this is where we kind of have to be very, I think creative about it.

0:04:25	SPEAKER_01
 Number two was that it'd be innovative.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_01
 So that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without adding just unnecessary, um, sort of functional bits to it.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_01
 Uh, and third priority, uh, ease of use.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_01
 So again, that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be, um, quite user friendly while still having technology.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_01
 So I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing and how we proceed with this in terms of marketing is that I think, um, what we should think about is how the, um, about how the innovation, uh, contributes to the look and feel and not so much to the functionality of it.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_01
 For example, like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something, you know what I mean?

0:05:12	SPEAKER_01
 Like, or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_01
 So how do you make innovation makes it more, more easy to use?

0:05:23	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's, I guess, where we're going to go with this.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_01
 Then there's the other aspect of the back, the, the market, um, research I have here is on fashion style, okay, which as we've agreed as a priority, um, top European fashion trend, um, that I read about, it says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_01
 Especially in clothes and furniture.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_01
 And when I first saw that, I thought, well, do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it or we get right into it or we completely steer away from it?

0:05:55	SPEAKER_01
 You know what I mean?

0:05:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:05:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if you can describe this trend, but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics, um, because I think what we're in, what we're in is partly sort of home decor, partly something like a computer.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_01
 Um, so I think we might want to be careful about how, you know, how quickly we create like our remote control in the shape of an apple or something.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_01
 I think that would be pushing it.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_01
 And then in terms of material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of might say ergonomic or friendly to handle, which is, which also indicated that last year this was, this was not the case.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_01
 So, um, probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_01
 So if we try and really capitalize on that, I think that'll be in our favor.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_01
 So this is the summary of everything.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_01
 Um, style is number one thing in the, in the market of who we're selling to.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_01
 Active design technology is also a must in that it seemed to be seen to be, uh, cutting edge, uh, but ease of use has to be insured throughout.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_01
 That was like the number three thing.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_01
 And then that then there are vibrant natural colors.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_01
 Um, that's the way I interpreted it anyway.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_01
 Softness and material shape and function.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_01
 And so I wrote, written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion, Mac iPods, something which is, I'd have to say very high tech, 10 gigabytes, whatever.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_01
 But when you hold it in your hand, there's like no buttons.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_01
 You know what a Mac iPod is?

0:07:31	SPEAKER_01
 I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it more of like a, more of like a comfortable type of, more of like a, maybe more vibrant, friendly thing to have.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_01
 Um, and then so this is with all that information, what I, what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we, we take these ideas and as we get into more, the more, um, technical like sort of production side of things that we think about shape, materials and themes or series that go throughout sort of like, uh, I don't know, like, um, we think of some kind of a thing, a theme that unifies it all that we agree on, uh, sort of like a marketing identity.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_01
 Um, does that make sense?

0:08:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. So, so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kind of get us thinking along those lines like lemon, lime, I don't know, green colors, whatever, just, I do, because I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their, what people associate them with in terms of texture, shape, colors, things like

0:08:44	SPEAKER_04
 that. Okay.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_01
 Like, um, the ones, the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like, um, like lemon or something like that, you know, something which is like you see a lot in, in other areas, like, I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_01
 So, you know, it's just, just an idea.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_01
 I'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly, um, into something which is, which seems to have something to, which is almost gimmicky because like, um, something to do with like lighting within it, like, you know, just, just in the simple sense when you pick up a phone and touch a button, it lights up, usually the buttons light up.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_01
 How can we build on that?

0:09:31	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe like it could light up in different colors or something or people could buy the, buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway, those are, that's all I have, but hopefully we can, we can revisit those ideas when we get into.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_05
 Great.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_05
 Thank you for that.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_05
 Um, Craig, do you want to plug yours in?

0:10:20	None
 Is there anything that's already available?

0:10:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_04
 Did you prefer?

0:10:47	SPEAKER_02
 It's probably not sending.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, something coming up.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it is.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_00
 So, link of this concept.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_00
 To research here, I have had the company the home pitch again.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_00
 It's a provided me with one example of previous existing call of controls.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_00
 There's a wee bit of discussion about the existing ones there.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm taking the suggestion from them, I think I'll put them into this.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_00
 I'm taking the suggestion on size and size of the control and the buttons.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_00
 The shape of the control and where about the buttons should be located on the control.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_00
 My final research is that most of the current controls are just big bricks with lots of buttons all over them.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_00
 They're not very attractive to look at.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_00
 They're not very comfortable to hold.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_00
 I just hold them like big bricks and they're very easy to lost.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_00
 They tend to be very dark colors.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_00
 So if the shadow places don't say the captures, you can't do it even.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_00
 The...

0:12:06	SPEAKER_00
 We can close themselves, tend to use a very inconsistent color scheme.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_00
 For instance, the standby button isn't always red, it really should be.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_00
 It's something that you can then identify with.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_00
 This is a red switch off, that's how it should be.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure if there's any other examples of that.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 So from that, I've got a couple of references for the end control.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_00
 Again, with the red color button, the standby and the other examples of that.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_00
 The buttons should be large.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_00
 They should be tiny little things like you get onto mobile phones.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_00
 They should be easy to press, very comfortable.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_00
 One of the examples given on the home page was there's an up and down volume button.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_00
 They both have a B on them.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_00
 So the up volume button, it should be a down volume button, not skin-to-concusing.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_00
 It should avoid things like that.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_00
 If the corporate color scheme was it, we should have a very bright color so that it can be identified anywhere.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_00
 Obviously trying to avoid being tacky there, but it could find very easily with your fear of lying on the bottom.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_01
 Do we have a corporate color scheme?

0:13:14	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's yellow because the website is yellow and there's the banner of the bottom yellow.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_05
 The play-dose yellow.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_05
 Definitely food for the lot there, I'm not quite sure.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_00
 Any extra features we add, the only basic one should be hidden.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_00
 There shouldn't be any visible without something to be open or something special.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_00
 If we do decide to go for voice activation, there should be a button that's alternative, possibly hidden in the open-to-up section, or something that's wrong with it, I can use voice to get a bit of a call.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_00
 We should definitely avoid the big square block, that's just wrong.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_00
 We've got an email from the research department, and they've said the voice control can now talk back if you ask a question.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_00
 It could be good to have them confirm any action you take.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_04
 That's a possibility.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_00
 I need the problems of either of it.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_00
 We don't know where this boogincugel is, I think it's a fashion and tailed frontings.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_00
 We don't know how far to pull the color scheme is.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_00
 You can see that you want the corporate colors, but you don't see if you can use any other color at all.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_01
 Great.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_01
 Lots of good information there.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, that was very good.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_01
 It's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's a good idea to have a cable.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_05
 Do you want to sit in the line of sight of this?

0:15:17	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, let me just get this.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_02
 There it is.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, that should be it.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_02
 I guess the same thing again, I started with something very basic.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_02
 So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_02
 And then you can just work through it and well either modify it or start from scratch.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_02
 Depending on what your needs are.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_02
 The components are exactly the same.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_02
 I think like what you guys said, the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_02
 The rest of the components, they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_02
 Like you said, time to market was a problem.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_02
 And how many components are physically in their own cost.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_02
 And the power is basically a factor of that.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_02
 And the lower components, the power, the logic, the transmitter, and infrared, they affect you in terms of the size of your device.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_02
 And that would have some impact on how, I think more how you hold rather than the actual use using the remote control because like we said, we've defined like we only want the basic things that to be visible on the rest of the image right at height.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_02
 So you know, it's just a matter of working out space.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_02
 So I guess three things, cost, complexity, and the size.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_02
 These are the three things that will have an impact on you.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_02
 So just go through the components.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_02
 These are the options that are available to you.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not very sure about the voice thing because I've got another email and it was quite sketchy on what the voice options are.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_02
 It could talk to you, but I never said anything about being able to listen.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_02
 It said something about a sensor, but I never clarified that.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe if you, well, I could see the other email that makes sense to you because they got back to me in the flight, different requirements.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_02
 Or different offerings of what components are available.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so your basic components are buttons.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, and you have a wheel available, like a mouse scroll wheel.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, there's an LCD display.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_02
 I think these are quite standard things.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_02
 They're standard, are they?

0:17:49	SPEAKER_02
 No, they're, well, in a sense that these are all the options available for you. I explained to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, then there's how the case actually looks.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_02
 It can actually be flat or it can be curved.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_02
 And then the different types of materials that you can use.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think you can use them in a combination.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_02
 But I could check back for you, but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_05
 I think plastic and rubber.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_02
 I think plastic and rubber would be fine, but plastic, rubber and wood, I wasn't, I'm not very sure about the titanium.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_02
 They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_02
 The rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use, but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_02
 So I think that there is some restriction on, I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together wood and titanium, but you know, it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one, you know, as opposed to two.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_02
 And the other components are logic chips.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_02
 Again, I'll go back to the component chips.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_02
 How complex or how easy the logic is, it depends on how many functions you have on the unit.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_02
 And that impacts cost.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think the logic chip has an issue about size because they should be about the same size.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_02
 Power consumption should be about the same.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 I think the main impact is complexity.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_02
 And the other thing is the power options.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_02
 The first one is the standard battery.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_02
 The second one, I think, is more of a gimmick than actually a usable thing.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_02
 It's a wind up.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_02
 You know, a crank.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_02
 Just by amazing.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_02
 But that might be something, I think that's more of a look and field decision, because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_02
 I think whatever it is, you still need a battery because I don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, the other ones are a solar power cell, which may not be a great idea in Europe or any country that has seasons, because half the year you be dead.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_02
 So like what I said, you probably need like a battery and something else.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_02
 And the kinetic one, I guess for me, is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with there.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_02
 And it's a nice sales gimmick, I think, from a marketing gimmick.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_02
 It's a technology thing. It's a shake it.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't work. Shake it. Knock it or something.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_02
 You know, you have, you have those balls, you know, those stress balls where you bounce the ball.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_02
 And it lights up and it goes, you know, that might be a gimmick combined with rubber.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_02
 You know, just to, if you get frustrated with remote control, you can throw it kind of, you know, just the...

0:20:27	SPEAKER_02
 I know you.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_02
 So, okay, from my role, I don't think there are personal preferences, but role preferences, I think, something comfortable to hold.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_02
 Small and slim, I guess that's more in the sense of, small and slim in terms of comfortable, not so small you can't, you know, like a phone or some too small phone.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_02
 And the other thing is from a production point of view, the less components we use and the simpler the components, means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_02
 And also the time to market and the complexity of developing, designing and debugging it.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_02
 So, okay, let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_02
 The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features, like the buttons are standard.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, the LCD panel and this grow wheel, you need more complicated logic.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_02
 The case, okay, with a rubber case, you can't have the solar panels.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, with the titanium case, let me just check that.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_02
 Titanium case can't be curved, it has to be square.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, there's no restriction on the plastic.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_01
 It can't be curved.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_02
 It can't be curved on the wood.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_02
 So, that's, again, I don't think you can use them in a combination.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, especially the titanium, I suspect they're very fixed to a particular need.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_02
 So, mixing them may not be a good idea.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_01
 Question on, can I ask questions?

0:22:01	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, well, yeah, it's just quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_01
 But yeah, ask questions.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_01
 Can we power a light in this?

0:22:10	SPEAKER_01
 Can we get a strong battery to power a light?

0:22:13	SPEAKER_02
 I think we could because the LCD panel requires power and the LCD is a form of a light.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so that...

0:22:20	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_05
 Why, what kind of light do you want?

0:22:27	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I mean, I'm thinking it might be that for this to be a high-tech thing, it's going to have to have something high-tech about it.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_01
 It's going to take battery power and to make that a realistic goal, I think one of the issues that will come up later is...

0:22:44	SPEAKER_02
 Are you thinking of a light in the sense of...

0:22:48	SPEAKER_02
 A light or a light in the sense of...

0:22:51	SPEAKER_02
 A laminate of color.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_01
 It was kind of...

0:22:53	SPEAKER_01
 A laminate of color.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_01
 A laminate of color.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_01
 I'm thinking along the lines of your...

0:22:57	SPEAKER_01
 You're in the dark watching a DVD, then you find the thing in the dark and you go like this.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_01
 And that's what everybody does.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_01
 Always the volume button in the dark.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_01
 And you just touch it or you just pick it up and it lights up or something.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_01
 Like a phone.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_01
 Like a backlight.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_01
 Whereas with phones, people charge them once a week.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their remote control every few days.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_02
 That's why I think the option of the kinetic thing, which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch,

0:23:29	SPEAKER_01
 like an object. But are people going to want to shake their movie control?

0:23:31	SPEAKER_02
 It's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_02
 So you could trigger that to a light.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_02
 Like I said, the bouncing ball thing.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_02
 So you can use that to power the light as opposed to, so when they pick it up right.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_02
 And then that sort of triggers the.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_05
 Well, let's just go back to the marketing ideas for a start.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_05
 And it's giving an idea on the time we've got about 15 minutes to play with at most.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_05
 So, yeah.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_05
 So just to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an absolute decision on the concepts of the product.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_05
 So back to your idea about incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg and the corporate color and things like that.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, what does everybody think about?

0:24:21	SPEAKER_05
 Does anybody have any ideas about how we can fit all that in together?

0:24:25	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, that's kind of the easier interface type of thing.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_05
 What are your thoughts on that?

0:24:29	SPEAKER_00
 I have a couple of very, maybe not a lot of fruit shapes.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_00
 They're very sort of curvy type shapes, then you can have the same type of texture and color as soft food.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_05
 So maybe do it.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_05
 Are we thinking something that like, could sit in your hand comfortably or you told on to comfortably or.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_00
 I'm supposed to sit in your hand comfortably.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_05
 So, something quite curvy.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:24:51	SPEAKER_05
 And right.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_05
 Color wise.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, you may have, it was a year.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_05
 I kind of remember him at the point about how if you have a nice bright color, you'll not lose it.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_05
 Is that.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_05
 What's on you?

0:25:03	SPEAKER_05
 About how if you have a bright color, you'll not lose it so much.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_05
 And when the corporate color is yellow, I mean, maybe we could think about.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_05
 About the color of the whole product being yellow, I don't know.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_05
 And then obviously the materials.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_05
 But as anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what might work.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I mean, I'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_01
 And we think that what we are, what our number one marketing motive is the look and feel.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_01
 So, for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sort of bits and pieces of concept and technology or whatever or fashion.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_01
 Then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sort of can visualize.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe what we could do is think about a concept which touches back to the color, the company color, yellow.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, if we think of something like I was saying also lime and lemon, you know, what can we come up with something where we try and associate it with with like the series.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_01
 We just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the shapes and.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_02
 Right. Is there a particular shape that you're interested in like is marketing every new research on?

0:26:25	SPEAKER_02
 Does it need to be long? Does it need square things?

0:26:28	SPEAKER_05
 I think circular and shape or.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, because that will help narrow down the choice of.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_05
 The choice of material.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_05
 Because I was kind of thinking about as well. You know how you get these shop-resistant mobile phones.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_05
 And they're plastic, but they're also like rubber on the outside. It kind of feels kind of warmer to the touch feels more comfortable.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe you could incorporate plastic and rubber into it and then then we could have curved shapes.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_05
 Because what are titanium yet? It's going to have to be.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_05
 Boxy and rectangular and I think we might be moving away from that.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_05
 So.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_05
 Do you want it in like the shape of a lemon? No, no, no, no, no.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_01
 It's more just that we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_01
 And then we have one sort of theme.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_05
 Okay. Right. Well.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_05
 So thoughts about the actual shape as a thing.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_00
 I'm quite like a sort of snowman type here. That's a new one, too. So larger bits. It's new hands.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_00
 And then you've got the other bulb at the top for just any other phone can be.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_05
 That's quite a distinct shape.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_05
 So yeah, should we go with that?

0:27:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, like two and what?

0:27:48	SPEAKER_01
 Like do you have a.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_01
 Do you want to draw it on the board?

0:27:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, just.

0:27:53	None
 I'm.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_00
 Some of them. You got two groups there. Maybe it could fall open. You got to start with inside.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_00
 That's cool.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_05
 And I mean, color wise, which is everything. I think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, do you want the whole thing yellow?

0:28:42	SPEAKER_00
 Quite nice. I've just had this around here. They start background yellow.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_00
 And then I have a nice pooled color for the buttons.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_05
 And also, I mean, how are we going to incorporate this slogan in the fact that it talks to you?

0:28:56	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, it might be quite cool if when you first start using it, it says, what is it putting fashion until electronics or something?

0:29:03	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_05
 Or when you like, if you turn it off or something, if it can speak, if you could actually say this slogan, it might be a bit more powerful than just having written on it somewhere.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_05
 Any thoughts on that at all?

0:29:15	SPEAKER_00
 I think that will be skirming. Turn on your.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_05
 I know.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_05
 Unless, I mean, if you also, like, where if we wanted to incorporate an LCD display, where we would have put that, we would put that on the inside.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_02
 Do we need an LCD display? What's the functionality of it?

0:29:36	SPEAKER_05
 Is it the spline to increase the cost of it a lot?

0:29:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but the question is, what are we using it?

0:29:41	SPEAKER_02
 What would we achieve from it?

0:29:43	SPEAKER_02
 Putting in lights is cheap, but putting in LCD panel just making glow is...

0:29:46	SPEAKER_01
 When you mention LCDs, I don't know what that would be about.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_01
 And the thing I could see it helping with, if it was somehow connected with listings.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_01
 So as you scroll through, because we said we might have a jog dial, as you scroll through your stations, you can...

0:30:00	SPEAKER_01
 You actually tell us what it is.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_02
 That will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_02
 So it's a bit nuts to get the unit in one day, Tuesday, Wednesday.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_02
 So no need for an LCD display?

0:30:13	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not saying there's no need for an LCD display, but...

0:30:16	SPEAKER_02
 Let's see if that would make it work.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_02
 What would it tell the user?

0:30:19	SPEAKER_02
 Because the LCD tends to be an output, as opposed to an input.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_02
 So there's a remote control need to talk back to the user.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_02
 We have the option of the speaker as well. The same thing goes for the speaker. Is there a need for a remote controller?

0:30:33	SPEAKER_02
 Why don't I... there is really a...

0:30:35	SPEAKER_05
 Talk back.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_05
 I would say no need for a talk back. Does anybody disagree with that?

0:30:43	SPEAKER_02
 You could put a game on it.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_02
 Easy.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_02
 When the TV dies, you can play with the remote control.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_05
 Right, so you're going to have the three different sets of functionalities.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_05
 Do you want to group them into the head of the new man?

0:31:00	SPEAKER_05
 Bolly the new man inside the new man? Is that what you're thinking?

0:31:05	SPEAKER_00
 I think the advanced ones, the ones you don't usually use, can be hidden inside.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_00
 I think they're the three different kinds of basic ones that have to go on there.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_00
 They're fun somewhere.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_05
 Okay. Right.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_05
 What else do you need to talk back to?

0:31:20	SPEAKER_02
 Where would you physically position the buttons?

0:31:23	SPEAKER_02
 I think that that has some impact on many things.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe you want to draw into that.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_05
 So I'm just going to pop this in here because I have a slider butt decision making.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_05
 Yep.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_05
 I'll try it for you on the butt.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, go five minutes.

0:31:52	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_05
 Back of you.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_05
 Energy.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_05
 Do you think that suggesting we're harporing the thing?

0:32:02	SPEAKER_05
 I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the backup of the battery but have kinetic power.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_01
 I've had kinetic things before and the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_02
 No, like I said, we have a hybrid kind of thing.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_02
 So it's not going to charge the battery.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_02
 It's just.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, just it's just worth pointing out because like I've known, I've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_01
 Also, known people to have things like like a jewelry watch they wear from time to time and they eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because I don't wear it all the time.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_01
 Look, remote control is similar.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_01
 Your way on vacation, I don't know, whatever, you, something, and it just starts to get worn down.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_05
 For the space that if you're, if you're away and you're not using it, then you're not using any power either.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_05
 So you'd have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_05
 I'm really sorry, we're going to have to wrap up quite quickly.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know as much time as I thought.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_05
 So I think that's what energy is referring to here.

0:33:07	SPEAKER_05
 Chip on print.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_05
 Is that that's an industrial design thing?

0:33:11	SPEAKER_05
 Is that David?

0:33:12	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_05
 As for the case, kind of discuss that.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_01
 And this size here, I'd suggest this be small.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_05
 And we're going to have like rubber buttons that feel kind of.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_01
 Just a lot of, I mean, one of the things running through my mind right now, I realized we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_01
 But we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low tech rubber buttons, plastic frame.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_01
 It's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_01
 Should we think about how we are actually getting this high tech user friendly theme?

0:33:53	SPEAKER_01
 Like what is it that we're using to achieve those goals?

0:33:57	SPEAKER_05
 I think that backlighting the buttons and stuff like that.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_02
 Or even a clearer case.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_02
 A glowing yellow type case where the yellow showble, but in the dark, it's sort of.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_02
 It's light.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_02
 So it's slightly transparent.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_05
 So it's yellow, like tinted yellow, but you can maybe see through it.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_02
 Or there might be a light running through it like a mouse.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_02
 Sure.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_02
 You know, you have colors mice and they don't eat that much power.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_02
 So the battery in that sense, we have one or two strategically placed lights.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_02
 Sure.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_02
 That sort of.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, they emanate a light through it.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but because the case is transparent, so it gives it a little bit of a glow.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:42	SPEAKER_01
 Doesn't make it freaky.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_01
 And then the other thing that we were, we committed ourselves achieving is simplicity.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_01
 And so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like some kind of an innovative concept about how the volume and the channels are controlled?

0:34:58	SPEAKER_01
 Because that's the main thing people want to do.

0:35:00	SPEAKER_01
 Could we use like a jog dial, like a nice sort of round somewhere on it where you just roll it?

0:35:05	SPEAKER_02
 The question is when you're rolling it, how do you want to roll it?

0:35:07	SPEAKER_02
 Do you want them to roll it like that?

0:35:09	SPEAKER_02
 Do you want them to roll it like that?

0:35:10	SPEAKER_02
 Because in a mouse, your hands in a position to roll it.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_02
 Whereas the other thing about having a jog dial this way, it tends to get moved accidentally.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you can do that.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_05
 If you're holding it in your hand.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_02
 That's a very unnatural motion to, yeah.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_02
 Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot?

0:35:32	SPEAKER_02
 We might work for volume.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_02
 And maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_02
 But not for channels, right?

0:35:38	SPEAKER_02
 If you have a telewisp box, you've got like, you don't have to buy all the channels.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_02
 You imagine trying to...

0:35:45	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_02
 And I don't think having that, you know, too quick, too slow, it's confusing to the...

0:35:51	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_00
 For skipping watch, watch my channel.

0:35:53	SPEAKER_00
 She used to have to skip the channel button.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_02
 But users tend to want to use that.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_02
 And once they lose out and they use it, experience it like...

0:36:00	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_02
 Because that becomes the most accessible...

0:36:02	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_01
 But that's not a bad thing, is it?

0:36:04	SPEAKER_01
 Just.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_01
 Because if you think about it, the alternative is to go push the button.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_01
 And it's not much easier than that.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_05
 Well, we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a job dial in nice and quickly.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_05
 I will afford them actually.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_05
 I think they're quite unique, very quick to use.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_05
 So does anybody oppose the idea of incorporating one into the design at all?

0:36:27	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_05
 And the other thing was, can we think of anyway getting the slogan into this thing?

0:36:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, if we...

0:36:35	SPEAKER_01
 If we keep coming back to this board here, it wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea.

0:36:40	SPEAKER_01
 Imagine that, I don't know, that it's within the shape of the hand, it's quite small.

0:36:45	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, okay.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_01
 We really got to wrap up.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_01
 It's small.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_01
 And that we've got like the slogan, somewhere like on the casing, at the side.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if we can do that, great.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I mean, isn't that what we just said, said we just have to decide now?

0:37:02	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_05
 Let's try and get the slogan on there.

0:37:05	SPEAKER_02
 And then like a jog, a band, a shape of the...

0:37:08	SPEAKER_01
 And then like a jog dial, somewhere that fits in with the shape of it, like, I don't know, like, here, in with that.

0:37:15	SPEAKER_02
 That might have one problem in terms of...

0:37:17	SPEAKER_02
 In terms of whether you're left-handed or you're right-handed, you might be locking yourself in.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_02
 Or maybe just fitting in, like, down the middle here.

0:37:24	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_02
 Can I just jump in and suggest I'm not going to answer that?

0:37:27	SPEAKER_05
 I'm really going to have to hurry on here, because we're actually over time.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_05
 It's kind of...

0:37:31	SPEAKER_05
 Is there anything anybody's unsure about just for enclosing?

0:37:35	SPEAKER_05
 The next meeting is going to be in 30 minutes, and so you can see in the screen here, what each of you are going to hopefully be doing.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_05
 And I know that the designer is going to be working with PlayDoh and that.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_05
 So that will be...

0:37:46	SPEAKER_05
 That will be good.

0:37:47	SPEAKER_05
 And I'll get the minutes to have the scene as possible.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_05
 Anything at all, you think we haven't discussed that we need to?

0:37:54	SPEAKER_05
 Everybody kind of happy about what they're going to be doing?

0:37:57	SPEAKER_02
 I think one thing would be the jog dial, because that's going to have quite a big impact on the same...

0:38:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think the jog dial, you know it just after you do that?

0:38:05	SPEAKER_01
 What if it was flat and you just...

0:38:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_02
 That would be great.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_02
 A slide, because then you don't have to put the hand.

0:38:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:11	SPEAKER_02
 I think incorporating your logo is quite straightforward.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_02
 There's lots of space for it.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_02
 That's kind of a design thing that you guys can just...

0:38:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_02
...but it's also a marketing and a function...

0:38:19	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_01
 And materials, we sort of said we do plastic and rubber to my hand.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:24	SPEAKER_01
 I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons, because that'll just be so standard.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_05
 Do we have something flush with the case?

0:38:31	SPEAKER_01
 Something a bit more flush.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:38:33	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we have rubber incorporated into the case as well, so that it has...

0:38:36	SPEAKER_01
 And also plastic, I've seen, can get really textured.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_01
 So you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_01
 It feels like fruit.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_01
 It's kind of like...

0:38:46	SPEAKER_01
 No, no.

0:38:47	SPEAKER_01
 You'd think that they were rubber, but they're not.

0:38:49	SPEAKER_01
 They're actually just plastic that's textured.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_01
 Kind of like that.

0:38:52	SPEAKER_05
 Kind of like that, yeah.

0:38:54	SPEAKER_05
 I'm going to have to call this to your close, because we're away every time.

0:38:56	SPEAKER_05
 So that's really good.

0:38:58	SPEAKER_05
 Like we've had so much to talk about, that's pretty much run out of time to do so.

0:39:03	SPEAKER_05
 So what do you do?

0:39:05	SPEAKER_05
 And design stuff.

0:39:07	SPEAKER_05
 Ooh.

0:39:08	SPEAKER_05
 Played all day.

0:39:10	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, quite jealous actually.

0:39:12	SPEAKER_05
 You got to choose first.

0:39:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we're kidding.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:39:25	SPEAKER_02
 Can I just swipe your power cable and don't think it matters?

0:39:35	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:39:36	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to pull everybody out first, and then put in whatever needs to be left.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_02
 That's you.

0:39:49	None
 Yeah.

0:39:52	SPEAKER_04
 This is real.

0:39:55	SPEAKER_02
 That's all there.

0:39:57	SPEAKER_02
 Oops.

0:39:59	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to take the microphone, because it's too lazy to take the mouth away.

0:40:05	SPEAKER_03
 Cool.

0:40:08	None
 Okay.

0:40:15	None
 Okay.

0:40:22	None
 Okay.

0:40:32	None
 Okay.

0:40:39	None
 Okay.
