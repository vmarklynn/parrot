0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so this is our first meeting of this design project and I am glad to show you the agenda for the meeting. I don't know if it was sent round to all of you.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know, anyway. This is the plan for today's meeting is firstly just to introduce the project briefly, although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already. Then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_02
 Then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the course of the design project and the meetings, specifically the whiteboard over there.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_02
 Then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan and discuss, come up with some preliminary ideas about it. Then that's it. We've got 25 minutes to do that until 11.25. Any questions?

0:01:27	SPEAKER_02
 No, at this point.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_02
 This is our project. What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for television. We want it to be something original, something trendy and also something user-friendly.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_02
 It has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this project.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_02
 The method that we're going to use to complete the project that has three components, such as the functional design of the remote control, the way we'll do that is to work individually, initially, and then come together for meetings to work on that. Similarly, with the conceptual design, we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise and our own laptops, and then we'll bring what we've done together. Then the detailed design will come after that.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_01
 I'm a bit confused about what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design. Is it just more detail?

0:03:18	SPEAKER_02
 I think we're talking that the functional design is more your area of things where you'll be, we want to look at what functions we need, it never might control, and what specific things it has to do, but the conceptual design is perhaps bigger than that and includes there. How it will be done?

0:03:48	SPEAKER_01
 Where do we identify the components of our product? I think it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify. It's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_02
 I think we'll start that initially with the functional design already.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so that's just a brief overview of the project itself. What I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for the project. Specifically the whiteboard. So each person in turn, I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard, the pens just underneath it there, and draw your favourite animal, and then tell everyone what your favourite characteristics of that animal are, and while you're doing that tell us your name, what your role is, and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_02
 Would you like to go first?

0:05:12	SPEAKER_03
 I do have a choice.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_03
 Cool.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_02
 You don't have to hurry, we've got plenty of time.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_03
 So my name's Katz, and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing when I say...

0:05:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, that's not no-one.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, good thing.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_03
 This is a rabbit.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_04
 At first I thought it was going to be Katz.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_03
 There are four sheepish moon- fazendo-asmegaes.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, excellent. And what's your role within the team? I am the, I need my notebook.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_03
 Top the number. Thank you. Okay, cool. I am the marketing expert.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_03
 So, like, I'm going to be doing the apparently according to the little guy on the computer that knows everything.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_03
 The user requirements specification of the functional design, trend-wotting in the conceptual design, and products of valuation in the detailed design.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. So, yeah.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_02
 And more about yourself. You're from Ankenlester.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_03
 Second year. Well, what else do you want to know?

0:07:31	SPEAKER_03
 I like sports. Yeah, aerobics, kickboxing, spinning, but not with rabbits.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_03
 Not with rabbits, no, no, no, and bats. I like bats as well.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_03
 And yeah, and I like cold tails, especially pink ones.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. Thanks for all to match the rabbit.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. So, my name is Marika.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_04
 Mr. Penn.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_02
 If you haven't got enough room, there's only a razor there and you can wrap it.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, well, Marika can make it smaller.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_04
 So, I'm the interface designer in this project.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_04
 And my favorite animal, I mean, I'm not so sure because I'm not so, so very familiar with all kinds of animals, but I do like dogs.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, sorry, maybe I shouldn't have said it beforehand.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_04
 Hmm.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_04
 Well, there are different kinds of dogs, but okay.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_00
 That's a better dog. It's like a dog.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 It's a bit more impressive than my mother. I think it needs four legs if it's going to work.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, maybe it has some cool foot patches.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and I do like dogs because they are good friends.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_04
 Two people and they are loyal.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_04
 Well, as compared to some other animals, they're really much more fun because they are not so independent.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, maybe the fact that they protect their home as well.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. What it has to do with my role in the project is hard to say.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_04
 I hope to be loyal to the project and not to let people doing similar projects know the details or projects or something.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, where are you from?

0:09:54	SPEAKER_04
 I'm from Estonia.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_04
 So, is there anything else you would like to know?

0:10:02	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, right, my roles.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_04
 So, in the different stages of the design, so at first I will be responsible for designing the technical functions of the remote control.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_04
 Then in the conceptual design stage, I need to come up with interface concept.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_04
 And then in the last stage, I will be responsible for the use interface design.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_00
 I'll do some.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_00
 I'll rub the features.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_00
 I'll rub the drawings there.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_01
 My name is Gaurav.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_01
 My favourite animal, one of my favourite animals is a cow.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_01
 I have a lot of no idea how to draw.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_02
 Good luck.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_01
 This is going to be...

0:11:23	SPEAKER_03
 We're not just like a big brown body and then some really skinny legs and just some bones.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_01
 Let me draw the body first.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_01
 And then what a long tail.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_01
 On a long face.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_03
 It looks like you.

0:11:44	SPEAKER_01
 And there is some grass there.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_01
 So, this is what I like about.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_01
 I think it keeps sitting there eating grass that do not disturb anybody.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_01
 They're kind of put this in a way.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_01
 So, yeah, I like cows.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_01
 My role in the project is the industrial designer.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_01
 So, I'm supposed to design all the details of the product, how it works and whatever it will take.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_01
 During the functional role, what are the various functions that have to be found by it.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_01
 During the conceptual design, what are the various components of it.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_01
 And finally, I'm not to show what was the last part.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_01
 The detailed design, I guess it will again be identification of the components and how they integrate with each other.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_01
 I'm from India.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_01
 I'm doing my PhD in Cyclingistics.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_01
 I sit at the Department of Psychology.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_02
 Thanks.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_02
 Now it's my turn, I'll be here soon.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_02
 This is like a carbon.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_02
 It looks really cute.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_02
 I like the cow.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_02
 I'm Jen.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_02
 I like dogs too, but I can't do that already because I can't do a dog as well as you can.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_02
 I like.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_00
 I like.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_03
 Is that a listen?

0:13:45	SPEAKER_01
 No way.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_04
 Wow.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_02
 It's a gecko.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, a gecko.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_03
 Is there a difference?

0:14:02	SPEAKER_04
 Are they also like lizards or are they yet?

0:14:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, they are.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_02
 They are kind of lizard.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_02
 And I like geckos because they remind me of warm places.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_02
 And where I was living in Cambodia, they used to live in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little geckos.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_04
 I hope you don't like snakes, do you?

0:14:24	SPEAKER_02
 I don't like snakes.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_02
 I can't.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_02
 We have nasty snakes.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_02
 It's very fun.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_02
 I was really young.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_02
 I'm from Melbourne.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_02
 And I'm your project manager for today.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_02
 And my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_02
 So that by the end of the day we come up with a great product.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_02
 Wonderful.

0:14:54	None
 Okay.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_02
 So let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_02
 I just thought about this that we could even put much more proficient in.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_02
 So this is the overall budget for our project.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_02
 We're planning to sell these remote controls for...

0:15:34	SPEAKER_02
 Let's make that go away.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_02
 That means we've got five minutes.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_02
 We're planning to sell the remote controls for 25 euros each.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_02
 And with that we're aiming for a profit of 50 million euros.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_02
 And that's selling them on the international market, not just in the UK.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_02
 So to do that, our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum 12 and a half euros so that we can reach that profit target.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_02
 So that's something to keep in mind when we're designing.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_02
 Let me just skip ahead to say that's the last thing.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_02
 We've only got a couple of minutes.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_02
 Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about what we're thinking of this?

0:16:59	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I'm just wondering whether there is any special feature that we want to have.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_04
 Want this remote control as opposed to the already existing ones.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's probably something that's best if we take away with this.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_02
 But if we all have a think when we go away from the meeting, what specific things could be included in this remote control?

0:17:34	SPEAKER_01
 I think in the beginning one thing was that was mentioned was that should be trendy user friendly and original.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_01
 So I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I was looking at the website and the other things that they've made and I like put down some inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_03
 So the motto is we put the fashion in electronics and so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm kind of thinking like those phones that they have, the new generation ones where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_03
 So it's something adding towards that so it's not overly, I don't know what most of them do on my own account.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_02
 So perhaps some sort of menu based thing or something that's a little less crowded than this.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_03
 I mean theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your TV.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_03
 But what do most people do? They turn it on. They watch certain specified channels and then they turn it off again.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_01
 There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used 90% of the time but will be used 10% of time.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_02
 There's no need to have buttons on it to do that. Maybe to do it could be one button for a menu or something that's really nice.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_02
 And then use that.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_03
 So if you're a kind of sad case that knows how your making tool works then that's fine and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have these buttons which is confusing.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_03
 Excellent. Because if you look at the train it's just very like there's no extra bits on it, the train on the website.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if I haven't had that up on the theme.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_03
 But it is just like a long, like thing used to moving people but it looks really pretty too.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_02
 Great.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_02
 Any other immediate thoughts?

0:19:48	SPEAKER_01
 We can aim for, I mean we can think about all these little things but we can aim for something that gives a high battery life.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 Although I don't think that it's a huge problem for a motor controls and even battery life every now and then you need to replace the batteries.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_04
 Even though it has to be original we shouldn't go too far away from the usual ones because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems with learning.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
 So it should fit in as well.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_01
 It's like a fancy whip.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_02
 It's a teeter type of a bit.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_02
 You can't access because you have no idea how to get in but the design is not very great.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_02
 Okay so we need to wrap it up now so that we can go away and get on with some of this.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_02
 We've got another meeting in 30 minutes so you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_02
 Basically you're looking at the working design.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_02
 You're looking at the technical functions design and for your experience the user requirements specification like I said at the start.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, thanks for that.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_02
 I'll see you in half an hour.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_02
 See you.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_02
 Carry the laptops back again.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_02
 Do we need to unplug things?

0:21:20	SPEAKER_02
 Probably.
