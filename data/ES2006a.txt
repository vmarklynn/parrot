0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so this is our first meeting of this design project.

0:00:19	SPEAKER_02
 And I'd like to show you the agenda for the meeting.

0:00:23	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if it was sent round to all of you.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_04
 I didn't rush away.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_02
 This is the plan for today's meeting is firstly just to introduce the project briefly, although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_02
 Then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_02
 Then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the course of the design project and the meetings, specifically the whiteboard over there.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_02
 Then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan and discuss, come up with some preliminary ideas about it.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_02
 And then that's it.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_02
 So we've got 25 minutes to do that.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_02
 That's until 11.25.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_02
 So any questions?

0:01:28	SPEAKER_02
 Not at this point.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_02
 So this is our project.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_02
 What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_02
 We want it to be something original, something trendy and also something user friendly.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_02
 So it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_02
 The method that we're going to use to complete the project, it has three components as such.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_02
 There's the functional design of the remote control.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_02
 The way we'll do that I think is to work individually and then come together from meetings to work on that.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_02
 Similarly, with the conceptual design, we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_02
 Then we'll bring what we've done together.

0:03:02	SPEAKER_02
 And then the detailed design will come after that.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_02
 We'll pull it all together.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_01
 I'm a bit confused about what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_01
 Is it just more detail?

0:03:17	SPEAKER_02
 I think we're talking that the functional design is more your area of things where you'll be, we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what specific things it has to do.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_02
 But the conceptual design is perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and that kind of thing.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_01
 Where do we identify the components of our product?

0:03:53	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_02
 I think we'll start initially with the functional design already.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_02
 That's just a brief overview of the project itself.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_02
 What I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for the project.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_02
 Specifically, the whiteboard.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_02
 Each person in turn, I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard that pens just underneath it there and draw your favorite animal and then tell everyone what your favorite characteristics of that animal are.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_02
 While you're doing that, tell us your name, what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_02
 How are you looking at me?

0:05:11	SPEAKER_02
 Would you like to go first?

0:05:12	SPEAKER_03
 Do I have a choice?

0:05:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, things falling everywhere.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_03
 Put the in-pockets.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_02
 Cool.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_02
 You don't have to hurry, we've got plenty of time.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_03
 So, my name's Kat, and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing, but I'm not sure.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_03
 That's got no eyes.

0:05:40	None
 Oh, good thing.

0:05:41	None
 Oh, the eyes always ruin it.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_03
 Like, okay, what do you want?

0:06:03	None
 Sorry.

0:06:06	None
 Okay.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_03
 Cool.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_03
 This is a rabbit.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, well, originally at first I thought it was going to be Kat.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I didn't think it's furry enough.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, I understand.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_04
 I can see by the ears.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, well, it's a fluffy rabbit.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_03
 Blue, rabbit is saying come in blue, but you need.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy.

0:06:36	SPEAKER_03
 And one day you'll be able to genetically modify them and they will come in pink.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_03
 Oh.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, excellent.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_02
 And what's your role within the team?

0:06:47	SPEAKER_03
 I am the...

0:06:48	SPEAKER_03
 I need my notebook.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_03
 Oh.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_03
 Top banana.

0:06:52	None
 Thank you.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, cool.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_03
 I am the marketing expert.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_03
 So, like, I'm going to be doing the apparently according to the little guy on the computer that knows everything.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_03
 The user requirements specification of the functional design, trend watching in the conceptual design and product evaluation in the detailed design.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_03
 So, yeah.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_03
 And more about yourself, you're from...

0:07:28	SPEAKER_03
 I'm from Leicester.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_03
 Second year.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_03
 What else do you want to know?

0:07:35	SPEAKER_03
 I like sport.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, aerobics, kickboxing, spinning.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_03
 But not with rabbits.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_03
 Not with rabbits, no, no.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_03
 And vets.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_03
 I like vets as well.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_03
 And yeah, and I like cocktails, especially pink ones.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_02
 Thanks a lot to match the rabbit.

0:07:59	None
 Okay.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_04
 So, my name is Marika.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_04
 Where's the pen?

0:08:08	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_04
 There's a...

0:08:10	SPEAKER_02
 And if you have not enough room, there's a new razor there and you can rub it.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_04
 Or I can make it smaller.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_04
 So, I'm the interface designer in this project.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_04
 And my favourite animal, I'm not so sure because I'm not so very familiar with all kinds of animals.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_04
 But I do like dogs.

0:08:36	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, sorry.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe I shouldn't have said it beforehand.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_04
 Hmm.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_04
 There are different kinds of dogs.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:08:54	None
 There.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_00
 That's so powerful.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_00
 It looks like a dog.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_03
 It's a bit more impressive than one rabbit.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_03
 I think it needs for like, if it's going to walk.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, maybe it has some colorful patches.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_04
 And I do like dogs because they are good friends.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_04
 Two people and they are loyal.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_04
 Well, as compared to small animals like cats, they are really much more fun because they are not so independent.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe the fact that they protect their home as well.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_04
 What it has to do with my role in the project is hard to say.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_04
 I hope to be loyal to the project and not to let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_02
 Where are you from?

0:09:55	SPEAKER_04
 I'm from Estonia.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_04
 So, is there anything else you'd like to know?

0:10:02	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, right.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_04
 My role.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_04
 So, in the different stages of the design.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_04
 So, at first, I will be responsible for designing the technical functions of the remote control.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_04
 Then in the conceptual design stage, I need to come up with interface concept.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_04
 And then in the last stage, I will be responsible for the interface design.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_00
 Do some.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_00
 I'll rub the features.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_00
 I'll rub the drawings too.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_01
 My name is Gorov.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_01
 My favorite animal.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_01
 One of my favorite animals is a cow.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_01
 I've got no idea how to draw a cow.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_02
 Good luck.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_01
 This is going to be...

0:11:24	SPEAKER_03
 They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs and just some horns.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_01
 So, let me draw the body first.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_01
 Big round body.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_01
 It's like a big legs.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_01
 And then put a long tail on a long face.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_03
 It's like eating.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_03
 It looks like you are.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_01
 There is some grass there.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_01
 This is what I like about...

0:11:53	SPEAKER_01
 It keeps sitting there eating grass that do not disturb anybody.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_01
 They're kind of put this in a way.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_01
 So, yeah.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_01
 I like cows.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_01
 My role in the project is industrial designer.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_01
 I'm supposed to design all the details of the product, how it works and whatever it will take during the functional role, what are the various functions that have to be performed by it during the conceptual design, what are the various components of it.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_01
 And finally, I'm not sure what was the last part.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 The detailed design, I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_01
 I'm from India.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_01
 I'm doing my PhD in the cycle linguistics.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_01
 I set up the department of psychology.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_04
 Thanks.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_02
 Right now it's my turn.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_02
 Obviously.

0:12:59	None
 Okay.

0:13:00	None
 This is a little bit of color.

0:13:01	None
 It looks really, really cute.

0:13:02	None
 Yeah.

0:13:03	None
 I like the cow.

0:13:04	None
 I'm Jen.

0:13:05	None
 Mm-hmm.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_02
 I like dogs too, but I can't do that already because I can't do a dog as well as you can.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_02
 I like...

0:13:14	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_02
 I like dogs too, but I can't do that already because I can't do a dog as well as you can.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_02
 I like...

0:13:21	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_02
 I like...

0:13:28	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_00
 Is that a laser?

0:13:33	None
 No way.

0:13:36	None
 Mm-hmm.

0:13:39	None
 I like dogs too.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_01
 I like dogs too.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_04
 Wow.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_02
 It's a gecko.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, a gecko.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_03
 Is that a difference?

0:14:02	SPEAKER_04
 Are they also like lizards or are they?

0:14:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, they are kind of lizard.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_02
 And I like geckos because they remind me of warm places.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_02
 And where I was living in Cambodia, they used to live in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_04
 I hope you don't like snakes, do you?

0:14:25	SPEAKER_02
 I don't like snakes.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_02
 I go straight home and we have nasty snakes.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_02
 That's where I'm from.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, it's really a...

0:14:31	SPEAKER_02
 I'm from Melbourne.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_02
 And I'm your project manager for today.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_02
 And my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_02
 Wonderful.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_02
 So let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_02
 I just thought about this that we could even put it much more proficient.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_02
 There we go.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_02
 So this is the overall budget for our project.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_02
 We've got...

0:15:31	SPEAKER_02
 We're planning to sell these remote controls for...

0:15:34	SPEAKER_02
 Let's make that go away.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_02
 That means we've got five minutes.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_02
 We're planning to sell the remote controls for 25 euros each.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_02
 And with that we're aiming for a profit of 50 million euros.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 And that's selling them on the international market, not just in the UK.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_02
 So to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum 12.5 euro so that we can reach that profit target.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_02
 So that's something to keep in mind while we're designing.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_02
 Let me just skip ahead to say that's the last thing.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_02
 We've only got a couple of minutes.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_02
 Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about what we're thinking of this remote

0:17:01	SPEAKER_04
 control? I'm just wondering whether there is like any special feature that we want to have...

0:17:07	SPEAKER_04
 One, this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's probably something that it's best if we take away with this.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_02
 But if we all have a think when we go away from the meeting, what specific things could be included in this remote control.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_01
 I think in the beginning one thing that was mentioned was that it should be trendy, user friendly and original.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_01
 So I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_03
 Something new.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I was looking at the website and the other things that they've made and I put down to inspirational words that I got from looking at the pictures.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_03
 So the motto is we put the fashion in electronics.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_03
 And so it's something that is sleek and stylish but is still functional.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_03
 So I'm kind of thinking, you know, like those phones that they have, the new generation ones, where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_03
 It's not right.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_03
 So it's something heading towards that so it's not overly...

0:18:28	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I don't know what almost the button do or my remote controls, but I figure how many do you need, do you need?

0:18:35	SPEAKER_02
 So perhaps some sort of menu based thing or something that's a little less crowded than this.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your TV, right?

0:18:46	SPEAKER_03
 But what do most people do? They turn it on, they watch certain specified channels, you know, and then they turn it off again.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_01
 There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used 90% of the time, but will be used 10% of the time.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_03
 There's no need to have buttons on it to do that.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it could be one button for a menu or something.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_02
 And then use that.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_03
 So if you're the kind of side case that knows how your remote control works, then, you know, that's fine and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons which is confusing.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_04
 Excellent.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_03
 Because if you look at the train, it's just very like, there's no extra bits on it, the train on the website.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if you can put it up on the thing, but it's just like a long thing used to moving people, but it looks really pretty too.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_02
 Great.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_02
 Any other immediate thoughts?

0:19:43	SPEAKER_02
 Good problem.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_01
 We can aim for, I mean, we can think about all these little things, but we can aim for something that gives a high battery life.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_01
 Although I don't think that it's a huge problem for remote controls and in the battery life every now and then you need to replace the batteries.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_04
 But I mean, even though it has to be original, we shouldn't go too far away from the usual ones because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems with learning.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_01
 So it should kind of fit in as well.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_01
 It's like this fancy website.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_02
 It's a teeter type of a...

0:20:30	SPEAKER_02
 You can't access because you have no idea how to get in, but the design is not very great.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. So we need to wrap it up now so that we can go away and get on with some of this.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_02
 We've got another meeting in 30 minutes.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_02
 So you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_02
 Basically, you're looking at the working design.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_02
 You're looking at the technical functions design.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_02
 And for you, it's the user requirements specification, like I said at the start.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. Thanks for that.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_02
 I'll see you in half an hour.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_02
 See you.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_02
 Carry the laptops back again.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_02
 Do we need to unplug things?

0:21:22	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.
