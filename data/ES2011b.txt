0:00:30	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so we'll try to zip through this since we're short on time.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_00
 Welcome everybody.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_00
 Hope your sessions went well.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_00
 So this is our functional design meeting.

0:00:45	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to consider user needs, technical effects, and the working design of our remote control.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_00
 I've been taking meetings on the minutes and the meetings, and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to, you can find them in there.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_00
 I'll get the ones up next time.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_00
 They're not finished yet.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_00
 Right, so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on, just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in the past?

0:01:25	SPEAKER_02
 Sure.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_02
 Is that an order?

0:01:27	SPEAKER_02
 No, I'm just sorry, I don't know the order.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_00
 No, any orders, then.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_02
 How do I put this?

0:01:34	SPEAKER_02
 I'll just put the cable in.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yes, I...

0:01:38	SPEAKER_00
 Is that it?

0:01:39	None
 Can you see?

0:01:40	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_01
 So what happens?

0:01:42	None
 I don't want it.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_02
 It takes a few seconds, I think.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_03
 Do you need two?

0:02:14	SPEAKER_02
 Who's that?

0:02:16	SPEAKER_01
 In the world, sometimes you have to do it.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_01
 It's like a three-setting cycle.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_01
 So I've press it a couple times.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_01
 Hold down function, and then I'll set it.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, right.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_00
 and then press function and F8.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_03
 Could you just plug it back into hers?

0:02:38	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, that's it.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_02
 Interesting.

0:02:41	None
 Yeah.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, one might be a little loose, but here we are.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, sit down.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_02
 In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found, um, 100 people were testing usability, laboratory through just their habits and their habits were observed and question as were given out.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_02
 The findings in some cases matched what we were talking about.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_02
 Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_02
 They don't like the way they feel.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_02
 They don't think they match their operating behavior and an example is what we were talking about the buttons.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_02
 They only use 10% of the buttons.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_02
 So later on, there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_02
 Easy to lose and RS.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what RS I means.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_02
 The person that did the questionnaire obviously did.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_02
 I'll include.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_02
 According to the frequency of use and the relevance of each button, I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_02
 So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_02
 They're used about 160 times power.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_02
 And, um, yeah.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_02
 So, and people like to zap a lot, apparently.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_02
 So this is the order, channel selection, teletext, volume and power.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_02
 The other ones are the settings and they're used less than, you know, 0.8 to 0.5 times per hour.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_02
 And this means that I think we could have like a button for all the settings and then just one and then from there go on to the audio on the screen, either on the remote or on the television.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_02
 And the screen and speech recognition, some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_02
 And if we look at the market, people from, well, from 15 to 35 year olds, I don't really know how to describe this.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_02
 Um, 91 to 76% of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_02
 Are people that are above 35 years old, um, years old, go from 35% to 8%.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_02
 So people that are 65, for example, wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_02
 Um, I don't, I don't know, um, what the decision to be made is, but I think that the people that actually do buy remote more are those like teenagers and young professionals.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_02
 Um, it's likely, but we should discuss this together.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_02
 Um, that's what I have to say about the matter.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_02
 Um, shall I, what do I do?

0:05:42	SPEAKER_02
 Do I give this to someone else?

0:05:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_00
 Just be a friend.

0:05:46	None
 All right.

0:05:47	None
 Let's get this.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so, now I need to press evade.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_03
 What is it?

0:06:22	SPEAKER_03
 Function effect.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_03
 What's function?

0:06:31	SPEAKER_03
 It's the little blue.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_03
 What is function?

0:06:33	SPEAKER_00
 I should be cool.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_03
 This is my presentation about the technical functions design.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_03
 I basically just tried to focus on what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_03
 I thought about it myself and looked on the internet.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_03
 So basically, I think it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user-friendly and fashionable way.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_03
 So I think things like keeping buttons close together that are used in the same way, or maybe making the same color, keeping the number of buttons to a minimum.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_03
 And also things like, is it small enough, large enough?

0:07:55	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not sure.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_03
 I guess we would need to do some research about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_03
 But basically, we need to make sure that it turns on and off the TV.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_03
 Does it have capacity to change the channels?

0:08:11	SPEAKER_03
 Does it do, do we need to have functions for cable or VCR?

0:08:17	SPEAKER_03
 And then is it findable?

0:08:20	SPEAKER_03
 And how do we want to do that?

0:08:24	SPEAKER_03
 And I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if this is really good.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_03
 And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than I did this.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I like the one on the right better, just because it does have fewer buttons.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_03
 But I mean, I think we can think about things like color and size shapes, that sort of thing, to best fit the user.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 That concludes my presentation.

0:09:03	None
 Okay.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, I need to look at things.

0:09:20	None
 Okay.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so this is on the working design, which is sort of the mechanical functions of the remote. The method I used was to look at existing designs and corporate ideas from our last reading. So I think we need two basic functions, which is just the basic remote functions.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_01
 User can input a channel or a volume setting and it would be outputs in the TV. And also we talked about a location function where maybe you could press a button on the TV and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would be for flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_01
 So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote input, which would probably be buttons, although we just talked about voice recognition, processor to take the information. Something to transmit it to the TV. And we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal, to have an output like possibly a beep or a vibration. And also you need a sender for location signal, which would probably be a separate thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their TV or stick it on their wall. And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works. Power comes from the battery, it goes to the chip, and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb, which would probably be the easiest way to send it to the TV. And then for the location function you would have a sender on the TV, which would output some sort of signal. We could use IR, but we'd probably want to use radio instead. That signal would go to a receiver, the chip would process it, and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_01
 So my personal preference is for how to build the remote would probably be a battery for the energy source, that way you wouldn't have to plug it in. A button pad for input, we can purchase a pre-made chip, which will hand all the processing stuff, IR transmitter to communicate to the TV that's just sort of standard.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_01
 So most TVs have an IR receiver, probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_01
 And I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself. So that concludes my presentation.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_03
 Do you know about, like, I don't know, you seem like you know about, yeah, I was an engineer.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. Well, thank you everybody. We'll discuss that in a minute. I just want to mention some new project requirements that came in.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_00
 Teletext is apparently outdated. So due to internet popularity, so that's off the list.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_00
 Also, our remote should be used only for television. No, extra internet, kind of fancy things, just through it and the television.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_00
 And also, we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this. So the phrase is, we put fashion in electronics.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_00
 So it's be fashionable, I guess. If we have something, I mean, silver and gold or yellow or color, we have like a kind of silver one like you saw and yellow writing, something like that.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. I guess we should make some kind of brainstorming terms of how it looks or like what it does.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_00
 Well, probably our target group and how it's going to appeal to our target group in, I don't know, the buttons and what it does.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_03
 That's sort of thing. So it's our target group, then people, so do you want to go ahead and design this thing with the finder button?

0:14:47	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's easy. Yeah. Okay. So then our target age group would be the 19 to 35 range.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. So that's the speed recognition. Oh, that's. I was thinking about that.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, speed recognition is really hard to program. And also if the TV is on, it's making sound and the people on the TV are talking.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_01
 If somebody says like one, then the TV's going to switch itself to channel. Yeah. Yeah. It seems like a silly. Yeah. Not sure how you would implement it.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_00
 And if you consider our budget, if you consider our budget to have speed recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little crazy.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. So are we going to have just some kind of a, like we'll have the buzzer on the, like on the TV itself?

0:15:43	SPEAKER_01
 But you would have to have a button on a TV or on your wall or someplace, but it's a TV already has power. Yeah. Yeah. You click the button. It's going to send out a signal.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_01
 I was thinking IR is a line of sight. So unless the remote is like actually in front of the TV, it's not going to work. So probably like a radio signal.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. On the phone. I answer out a signal. And then the remote. Here's the signal. And so it beeps probably.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. So you need like a separate base for that or like something. You have to sold separately because if the sender is on the remote, then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_02
 So do you plug it in the TV?

0:16:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. Probably just take it on TV. Okay.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_03
 So it's now like a two part. Yeah.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_03
 So we get to design that too. Make it fashionable. Okay.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_00
 So do you think even though we're not talking about speech recognition, our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals?

0:16:48	SPEAKER_02
 Should that thing be on the thing to put the use you're talking about a home for it? Do you still want to build a little thing next to the tally or hang on the wall or shall we leave that?

0:17:02	SPEAKER_00
 You probably leave that. I mean, I guess one takes care of the other.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. Yeah.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_00
 If you can. Yeah. If you can call it, then it can be anywhere.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. For them. So you have that button that so there's is there a light or shall we just have a radio?

0:17:21	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, on the phone.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_02
 It seems like a need the light.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. I think that's what the phone is.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. We need to find your phone. You should have someone call it. It starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out the couch.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_00
 And like it's the phones under the couch.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah. So any of the other buttons. So we have this.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_00
 So I mean, the two remotes that you had shown.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_00
 I don't remember who showed me.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_00
 I needed.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_00
 There. I mean, one look like it was for VCR type thing and the other look like just television.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_03
 I think they're both sort of just like general. They're both general elements.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_00
 That is something we have to decide is whether we want to have VCR capabilities.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_01
 Does anyone know if VCRs are the same across international?

0:18:19	SPEAKER_02
 They're not.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. So you need like a whole different.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_00
 The DVD probably is.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_01
 Other than that region including.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_00
 But these.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_00
 And if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers, I mean, it's going to be DVD type.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_03
 That's the technology these days.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_03
 I think still it shouldn't be that hard to type like just reduce the number of buttons.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_03
 Like because if you just have like one menu button that works like with.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_03
 You know, where you can just kind of scroll through the.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_02
 Well, for sure we need the.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_02
 I think we can just design the.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_02
 Channels.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, power is just a button.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_02
 And it's not used that much.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_02
 And it's usually that red.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_02
 And I think it's quite nice to keep it like a red.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_00
 You know, I've seen some.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_00
 The remote so where you just hold one.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_00
 Like if you hold one down, it's it's a different color than the other buttons, but that turns it on.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_00
 So you don't actually have a separate power button.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_03
 It seems like that would be hard though.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, because unless you might be confusing.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_03
 Just because I wouldn't I would probably pick it up and just be like a.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_03
 Why is there no.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_00
 Besides you like to be able to get power.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_00
 So we definitely want a power button and numbers.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_02
 Or even I'm.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if people are.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_02
 But if you want to reduce the number of buttons instead of having like one to nine half a sort of.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_02
 That sort of like a joystick flat.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_02
 Because people seem now the iPods up.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 People seem to like this thing that there's no.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_02
 You don't have one.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's an interesting idea because it's cool.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_03
 It's funny.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_03
 Like if like I just I don't have an iPod, but like I you know, I just like started messing around with one of my friends.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_03
 The other day and you just sort of and.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_03
 It's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_03
 Like it's not that hard.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_03
 It's just and it's one thing.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_03
 And everything.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_02
 But do you need a screen then?

0:20:36	SPEAKER_02
 Do you have to have a screen?

0:20:37	SPEAKER_02
 Well, can't tell them like can't you?

0:20:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_01
 You have the number.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_01
 You can have the number.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_02
 The telegram.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_03
 One two three four five.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_00
 Once you scroll.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_00
 So we have this like scrolling sort of button.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_03
 It's just like the same.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_03
 It's like technology as a mess.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_02
 And then you do that.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_02
 And then you can have.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_02
 If you actually just want to zap, you can have like a thing.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_02
 Like that and that and then it can just be plus and minus.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_03
 So like it's like a little part of the circle that.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_02
 So it's just a region of the circle that you can.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_00
 Click on.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_00
 Actually.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_00
 We could we could even have four buttons.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_00
 Like that's the if that's the mouse, you could have the volume.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_00
 And the channel changes just like on that.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_03
 So volume could be like the top and the bottom.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_03
 So do you need to.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_02
 Only mean the function.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_03
 I mean like, okay, because so.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_03
 I guess.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_03
 So when you scroll your thumb like around it, it'll like, let's say you go, you're going clockwise.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_03
 That means you're going to go up the channels and then scroll the other way and it'll go down.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_03
 But then so if you want to switch to the, do you have to switch to a function where.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_03
 Like so either in that mode or you're in the mode where like.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_03
 It just has like the four like, you know, this is channel that way.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_03
 That's that way and volume is up and down.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but it knows for some reason.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_02
 It's just the iPod.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_02
 It's just no.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_01
 The iPod knows.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_01
 If it works on the iPod, then it works.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_03
 So you just, you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_02
 Well, for the volume, you have to press the middle.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_03
 And then go up.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_03
 So you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_03
 And then it's like holding up.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_02
 But if you like that makes no sense because there's already ones with up and down here.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_00
 That I've seen and you.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_00
 Is there an actual actual button or you actually, you're just using the mask to go up and down.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_02
 Well, what do you, for the, like, what do you present?

0:22:48	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_02
 If you're on the channel, let's say, then you press on the middle and then if you do that again, the volume goes up.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_02
 And if you do that, it goes down.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_02
 But if you want to keep it with volume here and here, I'm pretty sure.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I mean, if we are going to use this for channels, right?

0:23:05	SPEAKER_00
 Wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow?

0:23:08	SPEAKER_00
 Like you could just have.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_02
 You can click and then have it up and down.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_03
 But actually, I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_03
 But the only thing is like, I've had so expensive.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_03
 Like it has to be.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_03
 Is that part of that?

0:23:23	SPEAKER_03
 Is that what makes me?

0:23:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_00
 They have so much memory though.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_00
 I think so.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's the.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's the, it's their capability.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, they can hold what?

0:23:33	SPEAKER_00
 Like 5,000.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_03
 I'm thinking we could, if we have so bit, I mean, but an iPad just has that circle.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_03
 But like since it just has this circle thing, you could make it a kind of cool shape.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_03
 Like it could be a cool sort of, you know, because it could be circular.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_02
 Or something weird like that.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_02
 It could just be simple instead of being a mess.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_02
 Because the other thing I didn't tell you on the presentation is that people find that.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_02
 Find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_02
 That's another thing they complained about.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_02
 What other buttons were that volume?

0:24:20	SPEAKER_02
 I would just said that.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_03
 So, okay, this is just for TV. It's not for, or it is does need to be compatible with.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_01
 The DVD is simple.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_01
 You have play, pause.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_00
 So how do you know actually our new project requirements?

0:24:36	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure if they meant, oh, use only for television as a not for DVD or just not Internet type thing.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_00
 So I'll, I'll check that and update you on the next.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_00
 So like if we have that, we'll hold off on that.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_02
 But DVD plays do usually have their own remote.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_03
 I know.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not really clear.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_01
 I have it all on one because you want to turn it on.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_01
 Then you want to turn off the volume and then you want to go to the menu.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_03
 So you'd have to have like, I think you would have to have like a function switch button, you know, somewhere.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_03
 So like you're either on TV, you're on DVD or you're on VCR.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_03
 Or you're like, so.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the DVD is only like four buttons.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I mean like to switch the phone.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_03
 So like to switch the function of the little circle disk.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_03
 The touchpad.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_01
 I think the circle only does.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_01
 The channel is an applicable DVD, really, because you don't want to.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but it would be.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_01
 Volume is.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_01
 Volume is actually controlled on the TV.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_01
 So you don't have to switch.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_03
 So, but I'm saying like, does it make sense to have like some kind of a button.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_03
 So like you're, if you're on TV, like you can switch channels.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_03
 But then if you're on DVD, then like the channel button, like the, the region of the disk that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_03
 You know, what to different.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, do we need to think about that?

0:25:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, let's think about it because we need to wrap up.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_00
 So everyone's going to go finish their questionnaire.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_00
 Then when we come back after lunch, we'll have 30 minutes of individual work.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so think about the things we've discussed and bring some ideas to our next meeting.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_00
 See you soon.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_03
 So I feel like I want to spaceship.
