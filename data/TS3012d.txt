0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 things are expensive.

0:00:04	None
 For blah blah.

0:00:06	SPEAKER_00
 Fight.

0:00:12	SPEAKER_02
 Got to close this?

0:00:13	SPEAKER_02
 We don't have any changes.

0:00:15	SPEAKER_02
 So no.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_04
 There we go.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, here we are again.

0:00:31	SPEAKER_01
 Detailed design.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, come on.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I forgot to insert the minutes, but it's about the same thing we discussed before.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_01
 It opened anyway.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_01
 Other design.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway, we took rubber as the material last time.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_01
 We also know that you just been busy with it.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_01
 Took the advanced ship to implement the advanced features.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we discussed the design.

0:01:14	SPEAKER_01
 Note sharp corners we rounded it off.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_01
 Like you see on the other screen.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_01
 Just fine.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_01
 We agreed that the color should be yellow and black.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_01
 We'll be in the back because it's more trendy than black anyway.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm okay.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_01
 We agreed that we would implement both LCD and speed recognition.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_01
 But I'll get to that in a moment.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_01
 Because some changes in the financials have left us some implications anyway.

0:01:42	SPEAKER_01
 So like I said, we had no inside of finances, no prices, but we have them now.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_01
 And it's bad.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_01
 Anyway, we are a prototype presentation.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_01
 Well, first you guys built the prototype.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_01
 So you could present that.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_00
 But let's see what we had to do.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_01
 No, just go ahead and present the will scrap it later because I think it's more as the same.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_02
 It's basically what we agreed upon.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_00
 Just to do it.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_00
 I haven't changed that much.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no, not at all.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_01
 I didn't expect any.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_01
 You just colored it.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_02
 And final design.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_02
 Basically, you knew what we discussed, covered buttons for we made a rubber, yellow color, black components.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_02
 As you can see right over here.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_02
 I like the menu.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_02
 It shows a different type of color for the menu, a bit darker yellow.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_02
 So that come really shows in this keypad.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_02
 If you put them all black, it's not really that good a contrast.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_01
 And I suppose the yellow is not printed on the rubber.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_01
 It's part of the rubber, I suppose.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_01
 Probably.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's more durable anyway, than printed on to.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_02
 It's more easier to just paint it on the rubber than to the integration story again.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_02
 So we have it's a bit round shape.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_02
 That's what we had.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_02
 We chose the buttons to be teletext, okay button, favorite channel and the mute.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_02
 So that's basically what we chose there.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_03
 You have anything to add please.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_03
 No, this is just a description of what we see there.

0:03:50	None
 So yeah.

0:03:51	None
 Yeah.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_02
 That's pretty much it.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_01
 That's my time to ruin everything.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_01
 Well, not ruin everything, but.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, sorry.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_01
 Finances.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_01
 That's what we have here.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_01
 What you drew.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_01
 We have battery power.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_01
 We have advanced chips and the sensor, the simple sensor and for speak recognition anyway.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_01
 So which you see, the which is one of the most expensive parts.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_01
 So, well, we have one curve, the design, rubber design.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_01
 And we had a special color.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_01
 It was supposed to be yellow, it was a special color.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_01
 So it's just half a euro for it.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_01
 We have push buttons and an LCD display, gives us a total of 17 euros in production cost, which is higher than the 12.5 that we are permitted to use.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_01
 So easy.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_01
 What do we scrape?

0:04:50	SPEAKER_01
 I think the best solution that I came up with is just to take out the speech recognition.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_01
 I'd say that too.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_01
 Because the LCD has more support on customer side.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_01
 There are 91% of the people or something like that.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_01
 And the number of people who are in the same position as the person who favor an LCD display.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_02
 And only 60% that favor speech recognition.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's hard to have an extra function with the speech which you can't do with normal remote control.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_01
 Which people already do.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_01
 So I took that out.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_01
 So I was still stuck with 13.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_01
 So I had to take out the special color, I suppose.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_01
 And yeah, I didn't see anything else I could take out.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_01
 So the push buttons, we need those.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_01
 So, apparently what I came up with, in order to have production costs of 12.5 euros, scrape speech recognition and the separate covers can account for the, if people want it, well, just then we'll just do it in black.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_01
 We'll just deliver it in black.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_01
 It has all the function that it's supposed to have.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_01
 And if you want the custom design, then you can buy the separate covers.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_02
 Or whatever you want.

0:05:58	SPEAKER_02
 Disagree with you on that.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_02
 Because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_02
 So can't we just, basically extend it to 13?

0:06:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, let's just see what we, now we have to be under 12.5.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_01
 It's not, okay, there's no go.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_01
 We go over 12.5.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_03
 But there's another problem.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_03
 If we take another cover, for instance, black, then we also need another button frame.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_03
 Because black and black doesn't work, obviously.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_01
 So I think that's what you were assigned to do really to see how both of us work together.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_01
 So I think it's one of the, it's a good way to help people to make, to keep product 22.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_01
 Just keep, you just make new covers for it, like we agreed before.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_01
 I agree.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_01
 And everything that's left is the basic function that we want our product to have.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_01
 Because the expensive parts are in the advanced chip, but we need that for the LCD display.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_01
 Then again, we have the LCD display, which is also expensive.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but let's go together.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_01
 And yeah, we could take out the curve.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_01
 We could take out the curve indeed.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_01
 We could take out the curve.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_01
 Is that an option?

0:07:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, for you.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_02
 I think the model is more important than the really the curve.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_02
 Because if you just end up with an entirely black, I think it's just ruined it.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_01
 But the fact that I took that decision or took this example, actually not really a decision, but the example is because we do offer the possibility of adding your own custom cover.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_01
 So you can change it into any color you want.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_01
 It's just you deliver a basic remote control with the possibility to change it into whatever you want.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_03
 Can you add another also change the material?

0:07:45	SPEAKER_03
 We take plastic for the basic cover.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_01
 You can take plastic, but something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really can't forward from the marketing research.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_01
 Is that people like the pushing feeling of the spongy feeling of the...

0:07:58	SPEAKER_01
 We can put it in a...

0:07:59	SPEAKER_01
 It also makes it different from the existing remote control.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_01
 It's all plastic, in terms of rubber would increase durability, because it doesn't break.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_03
 But what do you then suggest we lose?

0:08:13	SPEAKER_03
 Because we have to lose two things.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_01
 Like I said, I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special color, which would make this...

0:08:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, and that's enough.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_01
 Like in gray.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's enough.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_02
 So black in gray is okay.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_01
 I guess those are the basic colors.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_02
 Which we can fabricate.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_04
 I think those people want to pay for it.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_04
 Why do we have to keep us on the profit?

0:08:38	SPEAKER_01
 That's the order.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_01
 We're just a project team.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_01
 And we got our orders from our company, which say we don't want to speak of...

0:08:48	SPEAKER_01
 We can take more than 1250 for this.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_01
 That's not our decision to take.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_01
 We have a budget of 1250 per product.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_02
 We need to stick to that.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it's really bad either.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_01
 We have the backup design thing.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_04
 I hope the people would like it.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_01
 I think they would do.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_01
 I think they do like it.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_01
 We agree upon that the cover thing was a nice idea, because you could have all sorts of designs, while at the same time just manufacturing one product, one basic product, which you can turn into any taste you want.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's the best solution.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_01
 Make those custom covers for the design aspect and keep the functionality between within the boundaries of the budget.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_03
 So you should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to say under the cost.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_03
 They know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_03
 That they know that.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it's worth it.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_01
 It doesn't mean anything to the customer.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_03
 Of course.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_03
 We don't care that you had to.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_03
 No, but I think the cover is such a nice idea.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_03
 Let's, that then they allow us to make some more costs.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_01
 We can at least tell them we didn't get that.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_01
 You don't know what I think it should either be a pack.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe they should be sold in stores with a standard cover.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_03
 We're not talking about that cost, but the one that has given us the order to design this.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_03
 We could at least make it like this, but like you said, and then tell them, okay, we had to drop this and that just that you know.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_03
 It isn't still an option, but not for this price.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's true.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_01
 So actually, it's not that much of an increase, but yeah, we can't contact them.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_01
 It's just the order that we got.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_01
 That's what we got to go with.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_01
 So it's either once just to get it through final.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_01
 It's either turned into plastic, drop the squishy feel, make it more breakable, or turn it yellow.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_01
 So, it's something we have to decide on.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_03
 Let's say, lose the curve.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that's true.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_01
 We could lose the curve.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I forgot that.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_01
 The curve.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_02
 So which curve is that made?

0:11:10	SPEAKER_02
 That's basically that.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_01
 Just this one, just the banana curve.

0:11:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, so this would be straight.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_01
 No, that would be a curve inside the thing, I guess.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_01
 Now, would that just be a straight remark, just like that?

0:11:29	SPEAKER_01
 Which would, yeah, turn it into something far more ordinary.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_01
 We could make it yellow then.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_02
 Second that.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_01
 Second that you're second to lose the curve.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_02
 No, that it would turn out to be a pretty straightforward remote control.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_01
 It's not really.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_01
 So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve, to separate from the rest of the remote control world.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_01
 So to speak.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_01
 So we keep the curve.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_01
 So the only solution is either to use to lose the yellow or lose the rubber.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_01
 And I'm in favor of keeping the rubber because it has more advantages than the color yellow has.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_02
 I would say.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_02
 I would agree with you on the color because that's an extra option.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_02
 Max or service we can deliver for a little bit more money.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_02
 So yeah, I guess people are willing to pay for that.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_01
 So I think we can take that option and just with the idea in the back overhead that you can customize your remote control.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_01
 So I think that would still make it a nice product.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, we're fine on that.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_01
 So it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_01
 But anyway, we're here.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, basically what we discussed is now.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_01
 That's just now.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_01
 Just could just discuss how the project went.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it was kind of.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_01
 I wanted to sort of expect to that.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_01
 Everything would turn out this way, but.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_01
 Because yeah, everything cannot be for free.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_01
 We didn't.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_01
 I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time because that was.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_01
 It was really essential really to make because we spent.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_01
 An entire stage designing a product.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_01
 Of which we had no idea what it would cost.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_01
 So just something.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's really.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_01
 Nothing stroke with reality actually.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_01
 I do.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_03
 I felt it blind throughout the project.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, beginning I had no list of.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_01
 I think it would have been.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_01
 And then I had no list of available finance at least the last me.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_01
 I would have expected had to have that.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_01
 So let's.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_04
 See.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, see if it sells.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I suppose this sells because it's very.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_01
 Very extended, but.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_01
 Like hoping that sells.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 I suppose it sells because it's good.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it's got everything for the for the reasonable price because we didn't know what it's going to cost anyway.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_04
 That's a fairly evaluate the product of us our design.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_04
 I have some.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_04
 A method and requirements and scale off.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_04
 I will present some statements and we will decide together what if it's true or false.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_04
 Then we see if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_04
 And I will.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_04
 Make a new blank sheet.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_04
 So the buttons the look and feel I thought it was okay, but the advanced settings screen audio and channel.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_04
 But your major thing.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_01
 We are not.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_01
 I think that is totally met because the menu really took them for the.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_01
 They have the feel they want.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_01
 They have the simplicity they want.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_01
 No, it's all.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's very very well met either two or one maybe.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_01
 I think we took that everything they wanted to consideration so it could either be a two or one.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_04
 So.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, one and a half.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_04
 But it's not an option.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah, it's a creator own option.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_04
 Look and feel it.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_04
 It's true.

0:15:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, so.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_04
 And the next one.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, when it's lost, you can find it for deaf people.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it's perfect, but we did everything possible to get it back.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_01
 Because it's stuck in your couch.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_01
 You can't see the light.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can't hear it.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I mean, we tried.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_01
 I think that deserves a one.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, definitely.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_04
 That's okay.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_04
 And the next one.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_04
 How is that?

0:15:56	SPEAKER_04
 We don't have a menu.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_04
 Menu, yeah.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_04
 I think that's part of it.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_03
 It could be a little bit more difficult than a normal emotional.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_03
 But then again, it's for young people.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_04
 So.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and LCD tells a lot about.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_02
 It's pretty straightforward.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_02
 You have a pretty straightforward navigation.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_02
 I'll choose to navigate through the LCD menu.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, big problem.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_04
 So it's one or one I.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_00
 I think what we did for the.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_01
 On phones.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_01
 So I think.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_01
 Issue on making a menu, actually.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_01
 And now it's just true.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it takes no.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_01
 It really doesn't take time to learn.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_01
 I think we took it so easy.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_01
 We have so little buttons.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_01
 Everything speaks for itself, really.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_01
 So I think it's yeah, we didn't.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_01
 It takes no tour one.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_01
 I guess maybe it's a two because the LCD is a little is a little new and.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_01
 There are some options hidden under the menu button.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_01
 So I might make it to two instead of a one.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_04
 I guess.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_04
 And LCD, you have to.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_04
 See it.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_04
 So let's make that a two.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_04
 It's a little bit.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_04
 Learning.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_04
 It's a little bit same, but.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_04
 It tells you.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_01
 It's not in a good way.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_01
 I think so.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's perfect.

0:17:25	SPEAKER_01
 The where it is, what it can't do.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_01
 If it's useful.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_01
 I think.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_04
 What are we.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_04
 Displaying on the LCD screen.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_04
 Just only the channels and.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_04
 Or.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_03
 In the menu, sir.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_03
 What's like brightness and.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_03
 Those kind of things we've put in the menu.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_03
 Because we have no buttons for this.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_02
 Basically the menu options indeed.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, in the LCD screen.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, the LCD screen.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_01
 The small screen.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_01
 And for the channel selection.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_01
 I thought it was.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_01
 I thought the people wanted previews on there.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I thought it was possible.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_01
 Because it's.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_01
 It requires quite a bit of bandwidth.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it's possible already, but.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_01
 They didn't really define what should be used for.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe a TV guide or something.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_01
 For example, TV guides.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_01
 That you can transmit.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_01
 Do it and everything.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_01
 Just for extra information on your programs.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_04
 It must be clear.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_01
 Also things like.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_01
 What's for menus or.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_01
 How about preferences of your.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_01
 How about configuring your remote control for favorite.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_01
 Your favorite channel for.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_01
 How do you configure that.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_01
 So that's could be done by the LCD display.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's good.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_01
 No, maybe it's not a one because it's we're not using it perfectly.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_01
 We didn't give it.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think we're discussing how we gave it enough thought though.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should just lower this for maybe maybe to three.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_01
 You could have used it more effectively.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_01
 Probably.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, indeed.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_04
 So everybody's agree with.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_04
 Free on it.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_04
 We are using it.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_04
 But it's not.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's not poorly used, but it's not efficiently used.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_01
 I think.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_01
 We could have even lost the selection button and done everything via LCD selection.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_01
 It's now it's just extra to illustrate him.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_01
 It's an extra feature.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_01
 But okay.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_01
 Free.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_03
 That's not really only an extra.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_03
 Nothing.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_03
 Seven.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_04
 Seven.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_04
 That's a.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_04
 Can you talk to remote control?

0:19:19	SPEAKER_01
 Or we can say.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we can't talk anymore.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_01
 So we script that.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_02
 Or we could say neutral because we scratch the.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
 Just to be a prey.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_01
 But of course you can talk to your remote control.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_01
 This is doing.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_04
 You can talk to it.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_04
 Not with the speech recognition.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, all the trends and no colors anymore.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_01
 So.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we did take everything in consideration, of course.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's okay.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_04
 But the colors we don't have special colors.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_01
 No, we don't have the colors.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_01
 But we took into consideration the fact that it's customizable.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_01
 We don't have it.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_02
 So.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_02
 So.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_01
 We don't have it.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_01
 We do have it.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_01
 It's just sold as a package.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_01
 It's not part of the basic product.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_03
 Changing colors is also trends.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_01
 That's what I call trendy.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, the shape is trendy.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_01
 The.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_01
 The functions are trendy.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_01
 It's just the colors that are not supporting the basic model.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_01
 Because yeah, it's just not affordable.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_01
 It's not a matter of.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_02
 Go there too then because it's not perfect because we can't do it initially.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_01
 It's possible but you have to pay extra for the.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_01
 For the possibility of having it on a different color.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_04
 Oh.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_04
 The two right?

0:20:49	None
 Yeah.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_04
 The last one.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_04
 That's a roll score overall.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_04
 It's a.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_04
 It's a.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_04
 It's a.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_04
 It's a.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_04
 It's a.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_04
 It's a.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_04
 It's a.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_04
 It's a.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_04
 It's a.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_04
 It's a.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_04
 It's a.

0:21:11	None
 It's a.

0:21:12	None
 It's a.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_04
 It's a.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_02
 It should be divided.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_02
 That's interesting.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_04
 it's.

0:21:21	None
 It's T 3.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_02
 It's two two third.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_05
 two two thirds.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_04
 So we can say it.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_04
 It's the product.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_01
 It's.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_01
 It's ok.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_01
 mostly it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition because yeah that gives you a 7 which ruins your average without that it would be like it would be under 2 so I think even with this it's reasonable.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah if we make it into a 4 as in neutral because we didn't implement it so we can't say that we yeah and it's really not well implemented we come out on an average of 2 1 8.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think it's 2 so it's okay. Which is pretty one good. Yeah 2 is pretty good.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_02
 It's at least on the positive side so we could definitely have done better if we've had more resources but

0:22:23	SPEAKER_01
 yeah I think it's probably yeah. I do admit that we did miss a little or didn't talk I'm talking about the possibility of the LCD display we could have used it more efficiently we just didn't think of it that way. Yeah we've scored a few. So like I said changing channels everything hidden in your LCD display so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_03
 What I think for this price this is really a reasonable product. I think we did very well

0:22:53	SPEAKER_01
 even if you look at this score we did quite well. With an LCD screen just looking for improvements

0:22:57	SPEAKER_03
 what you could have improved. But if people really want speech recognition then they must be prepared to pay more. Yeah I did not mention get kids just stick them in TV and say change

0:23:09	SPEAKER_01
 the channel. But for this price you cannot accept that. I don't think so. It's not affordable. No you should lose the LCD screen probably but I think that's the more worth the speech recognition.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_01
 It's also more attractive. Definitely. Okay. What was that? Yeah. Yeah.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_01
 So that's the final product without the speakers. I guess. Let's see what was left of that.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_01
 Another one. Yeah we evaluate the products. General projects. What's in the product? I mean for example I thought we were pretty creative and when we created we took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example which I thought was pretty creative because it was never ever ever listed somewhere. Favorite channel? Well anyways you know leaderships up to you. I mean perhaps I screwed up because I put it for the speech recognition to do it but that's not for me. I think we did pretty well as teamwork. I was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime because when I got the input for the financial results initially of course I wanted to contact you say look this is you're doing the wrong thing you're wasting your time now because we're implementing stuff that we cannot afford so it would be better if there was more communication between the director's education which would normally do either call or email someone so that was too bad it wasn't possible here. That's the same thing that I

0:25:00	SPEAKER_03
 didn't get. But they were using materials that I didn't have. So it didn't have or didn't

0:25:05	SPEAKER_01
 knew what they cost or whatever. There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them so that was a little unclear I suppose. I think it's smart but smart but it was pretty cool. I think it's a question for design issues. My head's right.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_01
 It's very easy just to give your thoughts a little easier to share them. Although for actual design

0:25:26	SPEAKER_02
 I'd say it's a little less time. The response time is very bad because it's good to visualize

0:25:32	SPEAKER_01
 everything but I think the response time should it could be a lot better. The digital pen was

0:25:35	SPEAKER_02
 definitely better to draw my ideas into further elaborate on that. But there's also one problem with

0:25:42	SPEAKER_03
 this I noticed. You have to finish a page before I don't have to. No no no no I didn't check the

0:25:48	SPEAKER_01
 finished button. It just you just did you copy it or whatever. Okay I saw that only if you check the notes or press done then then you can then exports the word automatically. But it's not necessary to check either one of those two. Okay but I made a preview you can just preview your page

0:26:07	SPEAKER_03
 in the in the program. Okay but I made three pages and they were not finished and when the third one was finished I wanted to download it and then it was not possible anymore because you have to close all the pages before going further. Okay before starting a new page. Okay so you cannot work on one on one page at the same time. That's not possible. Okay finish it completely then download it. It's then start a new one. Yeah that's not very handy. Let's if you know that's

0:26:32	SPEAKER_01
 done. Yeah understand it. Okay. And a new idea yeah more communication between between that's the thing I noticed the communication is very important because if you get new information it's essential for other teammates to know that as soon as possible because you would avoid making doing extra work because you were doing extra work now working on the on the speech recognition limitation both on the technical and on the design side. So I think that could have been better but that's I think it's more of a setting here that you kind of communicate

0:27:07	SPEAKER_02
 then and somewhere else. Yeah possibly be is a more real-time information base so we can all see

0:27:16	SPEAKER_01
 yeah I think so unless spam probably I'm not sure you got spammed as well but I get spend like every every two minutes there was another email about master classes or something so which were totally useless actually I thought I should probably look into them. They're all useless

0:27:32	SPEAKER_02
 so I just I personally did not have that that's probably your luck distribution but I also did not really was you had that as well is that we finished up the design and then we checked the website and then there was just extra information of the five minutes yeah there was a little delay in

0:27:55	SPEAKER_01
 that yeah I didn't have any more information it's just always the same here so that's that's kind of an email change but not for me so I had no extra information to go and I wouldn't than what you give me actually I couldn't do any research myself or that's yeah I could have done a little extra work probably but I was busy enough anyways and any ideas found or is that probably

0:28:21	SPEAKER_00
 yeah I would say I'm doing half of this anyway I have no clue it's like

0:28:36	SPEAKER_01
 should if the project is evaluated and it was within budget we should sell a ray

0:28:43	SPEAKER_02
 bring out the beer champagne

0:28:47	SPEAKER_01
 okay one more about it I'm sure what we should still do that let's see but

0:28:58	SPEAKER_03
 all your tasks are finished right yeah I have no way you're assistant my coach is being very

0:29:04	SPEAKER_01
 silent now yeah yeah I asked the the total report you finished up I think we took very little time now because yeah we're agreement everything the design is okay one thing we missed though we

0:29:21	SPEAKER_03
 never a product name no how about you probably it's better than I think than a serial number Sony TR something or I think of a catchy name I'll be working on this until the beep until the

0:29:37	SPEAKER_04
 beep show fruit name fruit name or something like that banana remote or something you don't

0:29:45	SPEAKER_01
 want to remember banana yeah it's the problem it's not yellow because it's not yellow it's not

0:29:49	SPEAKER_02
 yellow yeah it's curved yeah well I was going for the RC deluxe but it's not really a catchy name

0:29:57	SPEAKER_03
 or anything it's more no it's at least it's not something with numbers numbers are so meaningless to

0:30:05	SPEAKER_02
 be yeah something with our company name can we do anything with that everything we'll website which will help us out

0:30:21	SPEAKER_01
 we'll react to the future RC step into the future of remote controlling your TV

0:30:40	SPEAKER_02
 is that a name or a catchy slogan yeah or a control your remote control the real reactor

0:30:50	SPEAKER_01
 really I go for future RC probably something

0:30:56	SPEAKER_03
 the real reactor I don't find that that betta-do

0:31:01	SPEAKER_01
 real reactor yeah it's a real reaction that makes me think of different products in a remote control really and that's sure we actually don't know

0:31:18	SPEAKER_04
 this is a pink

0:31:19	SPEAKER_02
 yeah so that's the one option reactor

0:31:41	SPEAKER_03
 I'm looking for things in the name so at the first three that is I'll see you right the banana down or you I take sure

0:31:53	SPEAKER_04
 remote

0:31:56	SPEAKER_03
 banana RC the triple R real reaction remote control

0:32:04	SPEAKER_04
 R3C do you mean it like R3C you mean it like this yeah the real reaction remote control R3C

0:32:17	SPEAKER_01
 all right no I got it should be it should be longer because it's not a product name it should be done a box triple R doesn't just write a triple like a word triple R see triple the stripe of triple Rc

0:32:29	SPEAKER_04
 you see the triple RC R3C

0:32:49	SPEAKER_01
 R-C dash I think it like this more triple R triple Rc

0:32:56	SPEAKER_02
 like a C right now or a dash and a C about do both

0:33:04	SPEAKER_01
 sure if it looks stupid I think that the RC together takes away the the image of it's a triple the first the first one looks like it's a triple remote control but it's only a single-round control and especially on the triple R that's important

0:33:25	SPEAKER_03
 I would react to remote I would lose to see just name it triple Rc's not it sounds like thinking about two different things and combining it I would just say triple R triple R yeah yeah triple R that's also short it's so catchy

0:33:47	SPEAKER_02
 okay so which one are we going to scratch definitely I'd say this one as well yeah the looks I think we're all in

0:33:59	SPEAKER_01
 agree you know the triple R triple R triple R

0:34:03	SPEAKER_04
 triple R

0:34:03	SPEAKER_01
 triple R you're pretty cool when you're pretty cool looks pretty cool what did you do now just like this is just just bring triple R looks doesn't look bad it's short it's okay so I've to write my report now I guess yeah so we have everything at the product we have the cost oh we have the possibility of everything okay I think it's a journey and I'm going to return to my layer and finish the report what was the short meaning what efficient though the boss has always the last one to go home

0:34:50	SPEAKER_00
 so probably okay okay see you in a minute

0:35:09	SPEAKER_04
 I will write that one in a word document okay

0:35:41	None
 okay could you guys draw me a picture of the file design to put in the cover of the report

0:36:03	SPEAKER_03
 cover I think this one I'll let's just do it all over again

0:36:12	SPEAKER_02
 I don't really know whether we can save it as a picture of it

0:36:15	SPEAKER_04
 is it okay if I try is it okay with you yeah okay I will ask you when I'll put it back

0:36:21	SPEAKER_03
 I need to information so it's okay it has been saving something but I do I don't know oh can I say X-P-S X-P-S is it okay can I not split this my document is the wrong one I cannot

0:37:03	SPEAKER_04
 it's maybe it's not on the network of the rest I don't think so

0:37:10	SPEAKER_03
 I wouldn't take that one no that's pity that means that we have to draw it again are you gonna do that sure how Okay. Okay. Okay.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, that's great. Yeah.

0:37:57	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. Okay.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, it's exposed. Oh, yeah. Okay.

0:38:13	SPEAKER_04
 Can I see scores? Oh, of course. Sorry.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_04
 Let's one, one, two, three.

0:38:19	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. We'll vote to. Yes.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_02
 Let's see you later. Yeah.

0:38:56	None
 Okay.
