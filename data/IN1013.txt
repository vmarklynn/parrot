0:00:00	None
 Tla B Oh my god.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, still doesn't feel natural.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:00:37	SPEAKER_05
 I wish you know the room had just attacked when a meeting started.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_05
 Starting.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_04
 Well enough.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_05
 So, you better start it.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_05
 Was your idea?

0:00:59	SPEAKER_03
 No, so I thought that we might speak a little bit about speech coding because nobody is doing here speech coding.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_03
 And I would like to have some maybe feedback because except me, I'm supposed to do some speech coding stuff here with Hineck, but you know that little bit at least that it's based on some, let's say, Hilbert transforms using longer temporal context and deriving some parameters which would be transmitted to decoder.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_03
 So it's a little bit different than the stuff which people are using now which is like LPC based.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_03
 And but we are at the beginning with everything more or less.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_03
 So still we can encode a speech.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_03
 But of course there are many problems which we still didn't solve.

0:01:51	SPEAKER_03
 And the biggest one is quite similar to LPC stuff where people still don't know how to exactly encode the carrier or the source signal.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_03
 You know what to do with the envelope or how to approximate the envelope, let's say, when you have got.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe is the whiteboard working?

0:02:15	SPEAKER_04
 Or not?

0:02:17	SPEAKER_03
 You mean that it would be nice to show us.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe I have a paper.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_03
 So what we are doing now, yeah.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_03
 You mean?

0:02:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, everybody knows our PC stuff how it works.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_03
 So I don't have to present anything more else.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_03
 But it's more or less very simple.

0:02:37	SPEAKER_03
 We have, as I said at the beginning, there is some speech now.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_03
 What we are, we might see it in a very simple way that we are using some Hilbert transform at the beginning to create analytics signal.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_03
 The analytic signal is the signal which is a complex which you can create from the real, some sequence.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_03
 And if you apply Hilbert transform on such a speech like a real trajectory, then you get a complex signal and you take just the amplitude.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_03
 Then you get Hilbert envelope code.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_03
 So, I don't know, yeah.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_05
 So is this different from the original PLP2 stuff then, is that?

0:03:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's not PLP at all.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_05
 That's what you started with, wasn't it?

0:03:28	SPEAKER_05
 That's the stuff that Marius.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_02
 No, but Marius is, it's not late up.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_02
 No, Marius is also late in Hilbert transform.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_03
 You're, I know what you mean with the PLP.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_03
 They were applying PLP with some iteration with this one approach.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_03
 They were doing some smooth thing of a spectrogram in two ways.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_03
 If I'm advertising it both temporarily and a spectrogram.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_03
 But PLP is using just the spectral direction, let's say you are doing for every 20-minute second processing one feature vector.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_03
 You are processing one spectral band, frequency band.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay.

0:04:06	SPEAKER_03
 So it's different direction.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but anyway, this is very simple.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_03
 So applying that absolute, absolute operation, you get Hilbert envelope.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_03
 And of course, there is the phase.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_03
 So it's just the complex operation.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_03
 And that's more or less all what we are doing.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_03
 So now what we know, what we know is how to approximate the Hilbert envelope.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_03
 We are applying that Hilbert, what is Marius stuff.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_03
 So he knows how to encode the Hilbert envelope using...

0:04:42	SPEAKER_03
 There's some kind of DCT or...

0:04:44	SPEAKER_03
 Like LSEFS or LPC.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_03
 You're applying again some linear operation model after that.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_05
 But it's a...

0:04:50	SPEAKER_05
 But it's a...

0:04:51	SPEAKER_05
 It's a different linear prediction.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_03
 It's a complex linear prediction.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_03
 It's a little bit different, not applied in frequency domain.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_03
 So instead of classical or BCL domain where you have a spectrum, let's say something like that, and you're applying some linear prediction model which is trying to approximate the spectrum, right?

0:05:10	SPEAKER_03
 So this is frequency.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_03
 In our case, we are trying to approximate kind of instantaneous energy.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_03
 So if this is a time and you get one frequency band, you can see something like this.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_03
 And we are trying to approximate that envelope which is the Hilbert envelope.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_03
 So again, we know what to do with Hilbert envelope.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_03
 We know that we can apply linear prediction model and it works pretty well.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_03
 But if you want to really well construct the speed signal or D...

0:05:47	SPEAKER_03
 You need also the phase signal, which is in some sense quite simple for voice speeds.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_03
 Because you use linear phase or...

0:05:55	SPEAKER_03
 The phase...

0:05:57	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's a phase or you can even call it like a carrier.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_03
 So the carrier is, if you know, amplitude modulation, right?

0:06:04	SPEAKER_03
 You might see something like there is really one cosine which is very good.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_05
 Well, it depends on how... I mean, you're talking... Yeah, just the carrier.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_05
 It's not necessarily phase, but if you're using some sort of... It's called like the...

0:06:17	SPEAKER_03
 So it all kind of... Right, right, exactly.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_03
 So this is the signal that you also have to somehow encode or transmit from a code of the decoder in order to resin-design it.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_05
 So what sort of bit right do you get for the encoding of the Hilbert transform, the spectrogram?

0:06:36	SPEAKER_05
 What do you mean?

0:06:37	SPEAKER_05
 What sort of coding do you get so far for the... For this one?

0:06:40	SPEAKER_05
 No, no, no, no.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_03
 Do you listen to linear prediction model?

0:06:43	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's just linear prediction.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_03
 Closical, right.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_03
 I mean...

0:06:47	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, okay, well, if you want to see it in more details...

0:06:50	SPEAKER_05
 No, no, no, no, but what sort of bit right do you get?

0:06:52	SPEAKER_05
 Is it... Do you have any sort of idea of what sort of bandwidth?

0:06:58	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, you mean...

0:06:59	SPEAKER_03
 Mean bitrate...

0:07:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, bitrate, I mean.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sure, sure.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_03
 So, more as we are... What we are using now is, let's say, something like 1.2 kilobits per second for...

0:07:12	SPEAKER_03
 The Hilbert and well.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, and that's with a fully optimized sort of compression, skate mode.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_05
 That's just the raw data.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_05
 It's, again, roughly estimated somewhere.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_03
 But we still know that we can go down.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sure.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_05
 You just cut out fewer bands and just use interpolation or whatever.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_05
 Exactly.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_03
 We are using like 15 bands.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, that's with the full spectrum basically being used.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_03
 But they are first... They are integrated into 15 bands using...

0:07:39	SPEAKER_03
 Classical way like in MFCC or in PLP.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_03
 You just apply some... those triangular windows or something like that in order to...

0:07:48	SPEAKER_03
 To get really just 15 bands, right?

0:07:51	SPEAKER_03
 And each band is then processed independently.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_03
 So for one band we more or less have like 100 beats.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. That's quite good.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_03
 So, for a hill band load.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_05
 And in Ecker was showing me how scalable it is in terms of...

0:08:04	SPEAKER_05
 You can take half the bands away and still get decent performance.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you can just...

0:08:10	SPEAKER_05
 Three quarters of them away.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_05
 It starts to degrade but it's still intelligible.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_05
 That sort of thing.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_05
 And that's without doing any sort of prediction of what the missing bands might be, right?

0:08:21	SPEAKER_03
 You just leave the band.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_05
 That's what we did.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_05
 You could be able to do some sort of code book.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I'm sure you...

0:08:27	SPEAKER_03
 You're missing data sort of by stuff.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_03
 There are many things we didn't try at all but...

0:08:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, exactly.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_03
 But now what I'm really trying to do is somehow approximate that...

0:08:36	SPEAKER_03
...of the carrier signal to do something with the carrier.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_03
 There are many simple things which you can do like...

0:08:41	SPEAKER_03
...quantization, scalar quantization, for example.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_05
 It would be nice to have a scalable scheme now, wouldn't it?

0:08:48	SPEAKER_05
 Like because you've got a nice scalable scheme for the...

0:08:51	SPEAKER_05
...coding of the smooth spectrum.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_05
 It would be nice to have some sort of scalable...

0:08:56	SPEAKER_05
...coding scheme for the voice signal as well, right?

0:08:59	SPEAKER_03
 It means something like...

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
...that kelp coding system where you are...

0:09:05	SPEAKER_03
...or...

0:09:06	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I don't know how this...

0:09:07	SPEAKER_03
 No, what is exactly a scalable system, what do you mean?

0:09:09	SPEAKER_05
 Well, a different bit right for the actual...

0:09:11	SPEAKER_05
...exitation as well.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_05
 Because I mean, it'd be nice to...

0:09:15	SPEAKER_05
...let's say if you had 1200 bits in there for the smooth spectrum and 1200 bits for the voice...

0:09:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I think this approach can do that because you really can speed it into several...

0:09:25	SPEAKER_03
...bag...

0:09:26	SPEAKER_03
...and you can decide how many bands you want from what.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_01
 I have a question.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_01
 Is the scale linear or is math scale like in...

0:09:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, this is a bar scale.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_01
 Is it bar scale like in...

0:09:37	SPEAKER_03
...or math scale?

0:09:38	SPEAKER_03
 So it's being more wider for...

0:09:42	SPEAKER_03
...our frequencies and of course...

0:09:44	SPEAKER_01
...the state.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_01
 Developing is different, right?

0:09:46	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_03
 But what I...

0:09:49	SPEAKER_03
...my sense is that it is not so much important still.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, it doesn't matter if you use math scale or bar scale but...

0:09:56	SPEAKER_03
 No, no.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_03
 Just like some solute...

0:09:58	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_03
 But that's what we are using.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_03
 So, actually, we are using just Gaussian windows here instead of those triangular...

0:10:05	SPEAKER_03
...because they are more...

0:10:06	SPEAKER_03
...smooth or...

0:10:07	SPEAKER_03
...no, it's better than for decoding.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_03
 It's better to play with them because they are not zero anywhere, you know?

0:10:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_03
 They are approaching...

0:10:16	SPEAKER_03
...or in linear they are in zero but...

0:10:18	SPEAKER_03
...actually, they are not.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_03
 So you don't have to care about some zero values here.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_03
 But more or less it doesn't matter.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_03
 We are using just Gaussian windows.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_02
 So after you're doing LSF, so...

0:10:30	SPEAKER_02
...like, I mean, how you are finally encoding those...

0:10:33	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_03
 Those that have about...

0:10:35	SPEAKER_03
...an envelope is...

0:10:36	SPEAKER_03
...is approximated by linear prediction.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_03
 So you have LPC coefficients which you can transcribe into LSFs...

0:10:43	SPEAKER_03
...which are...

0:10:44	SPEAKER_03
...and then vector quantiles or...

0:10:45	SPEAKER_03
...or...

0:10:46	SPEAKER_05
...or...

0:10:47	SPEAKER_02
...or...

0:10:48	SPEAKER_02
...or...

0:10:49	SPEAKER_02
...or...

0:10:50	SPEAKER_03
...or...

0:10:51	SPEAKER_03
...or...

0:10:52	SPEAKER_03
...or...

0:10:53	SPEAKER_03
...or...

0:10:54	SPEAKER_03
...or...

0:10:55	SPEAKER_03
...or...

0:10:56	SPEAKER_03
...or...

0:10:57	SPEAKER_03
...or...

0:10:58	SPEAKER_02
...or...

0:10:59	SPEAKER_03
...then you apply those...

0:11:01	SPEAKER_03
...T Dracula-o-G Wonst Windows.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_03
 So this is done for 1, a second.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_03
 8,000 samples for 8 Sisters.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_03
 You know cells.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_03
 Some of the 40 Ding used.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_03
 Good collaborating.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_03
 There you go!

0:11:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:15	None
 And so you split into 50 Then you applied those dropping intozer bits.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_03
 If only carbon is diagrammed right there.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_02
 Like, figure it out or population.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_03
 Right, exactly, you just apply a piece.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_03
 So, autocorrelation let's say, or you can do power spectrum, whatever.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so for each one you get LSS here.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_02
 So how many LSS you're using?

0:11:41	SPEAKER_03
 Oh well, I'm using now like 20 LSS per one second, per one frequency band.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_05
 So, but you have 20, 15.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_02
 How many bands do you use?

0:11:52	SPEAKER_02
 20, 15.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_02
 15, you're not skipping any bands or like...

0:11:55	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, if I just keep...

0:11:56	SPEAKER_02
 15 into 20 then.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_03
 So 20 LSS each one is quantized by four or five beats.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_05
 So it's 300...

0:12:09	SPEAKER_03
 Of what? 300 beats?

0:12:10	SPEAKER_05
 It's a total of 300 sort of parameters per second.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_05
 Two. Yeah, yeah.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_00
 But face your not-em coding,

0:12:20	SPEAKER_02
 you think face your directly transmitting band? You mean this face the Hilbert carrier or...

0:12:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_05
 No, of course.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_04
 Face your field burn,

0:12:28	SPEAKER_05
 he's not transmitting that at all really at this point in time.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you're not transmitting at all.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_03
 Well, there are many things you can do. We don't...

0:12:36	SPEAKER_03
 First thing what you can already do is just to replace it by Gaussian.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yes, noise.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_03
 So you can really use...

0:12:43	SPEAKER_03
 Like in a...

0:12:43	SPEAKER_03
 You can whisper in time.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_03
 Right, it centers in a sense.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_03
 Or you can replace it by some cosine, one cosine generated in a central frequency of that Gaussian window.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_05
 Or one of these glottal pulse things.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_05
 And just use basic LPC10 style.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_05
 Which is probably, I mean, if you were going to aim for like a very low rate code of life, I'm 100 bits per second, I guess.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_05
 That's...

0:13:07	SPEAKER_05
 That's probably fine.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_02
 So what is the standard knowledge?

0:13:12	SPEAKER_02
 It's 2kV per second.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_05
 The lowest standard is Malp, I think, which is 2400.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, the standard.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_05
 It's been implemented at 1200.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_05
 It's per second using more more complicated quantizations, games and stuff like that.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_05
 So I'm 100?

0:13:26	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, I think so, yeah.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it's for solutions.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_05
 I saw it. They used matrix quantization on the LPC...

0:13:32	SPEAKER_05
 On the LSF parameters or whatever.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, that's quite...

0:13:36	SPEAKER_05
 It becomes quite computationally intensive.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_05
 But I mean, I imagine the same sort of approach could be...

0:13:40	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I'm just comparing with LPC10 standard, which is like classical LPC.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_03
 It'll be optimized.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_03
 So then there is, I think, 2.4 kbps to be trade for that.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, that's the same.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_05
 20 milps, a lot better quality than that.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, definitely.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_02
 But this is good, except...

0:13:57	SPEAKER_02
 This is...

0:13:57	SPEAKER_02
 You have good milps.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_03
 No, I mean, LPC10 is just LPC.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, it's not good, it's good.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_03
 I think...

0:14:03	SPEAKER_03
 Just noise or just still seen positive...

0:14:05	SPEAKER_05
 I think sound for camp or however you pronounce it.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it's about 4,800, I think.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it's a 1.0, yeah.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_02
 But the standard's 4, yeah.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_02
 That's, I think, even GSM and all this G729.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_02
 Or based around that.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah, on B7.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_05
 At least it gives...

0:14:21	SPEAKER_05
 It's not terribly interesting, though.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_02
 But still there's code book news, so that's...

0:14:26	SPEAKER_02
 So it may be better than using just random noise.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I mean, you've got a bunch of options, haven't you?

0:14:32	SPEAKER_05
 You can use a...

0:14:34	SPEAKER_05
 A poetic side, or you could use...

0:14:36	SPEAKER_03
 Well, more or less, what we didn't do is analyze Bicentas.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_03
 Right, so that's what...

0:14:40	SPEAKER_03
 Sound is better based.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_03
 No, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so this is what we already do, and that might help a lot, of course.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but what's more interesting?

0:14:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, exactly.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_03
 That's the question.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_05
 I suspect there's something like...

0:14:54	SPEAKER_05
 Help, you're going to get a lot higher bandwidth, aren't you?

0:14:58	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, it's a higher bandwidth standard.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_03
 It's a little bit, yeah, yeah, sure.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_03
 For example, there...

0:15:03	SPEAKER_03
 What I also did was a simple peak-picking algorithm.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_03
 So if you take a look on the spectrum of the carrier signal, which is more or less like the cosine, if you really take a look on that, but it is kind of frequency shifted cosine, or frequency modulated cosine.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_03
 So the frequency is really changing.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, the amplitude is not constant all the time.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_03
 It should be theoretically, but practically it's not.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_03
 So what you can see for one second signal, you more or less, you really might see some like one impulse there, or spectral line for.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_03
 But usually there are many others, which are quite small, but they are quite important.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_03
 If you don't transmit them, then the signal is quite roboticosome.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_03
 So if you really transmit just one spectrometer line.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_03
 But this is what you can do, and you can understand pretty well.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_03
 The signal is audible or...

0:15:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so...

0:15:56	SPEAKER_03
 If you really just find one line, one spectrometer, the dominant one in the spectrum of the carrier Hilbert carrier, and you just transmit this parameter.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_05
 Because it's a bit tricky, isn't it?

0:16:09	SPEAKER_05
 It's not like a standard...

0:16:11	SPEAKER_05
 I'm just thinking, I mean, what sort of option...

0:16:13	SPEAKER_05
 It's not like you can't just do standard, you know, inverse filtering for single reconstruction, or anything like that, can you?

0:16:20	SPEAKER_03
 It's even easier, because what you have to do is just divide...

0:16:25	SPEAKER_03
 You just multiply that Hilbert and all BIDET Hilbert carrier.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_03
 That's all.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, okay, and then you just do the inverse FFT or whatever.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_03
 InOSU.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, yeah, I mean, you've got...

0:16:36	SPEAKER_03
 So you just multiply that one Hilbert carrier, which is transcribed by OSFs.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_03
 BIDET, this one, IFFT signal, so...

0:16:43	SPEAKER_05
 But that's going to be susceptible to having phase problems, is it?

0:16:47	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you mean the phase of that carrier?

0:16:52	SPEAKER_03
 How could signal...

0:16:53	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, I try to play also with that, and I found that it doesn't matter so much, which is the phase.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_03
 Because we are using just one second window.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_03
 So of course, there might be some disturbance...

0:17:07	SPEAKER_03
 Disturbed when you concatenate those segments together, but then the phase might be important.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_03
 But otherwise, I mean, I didn't find anything important with the phase.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_03
 Like, quick, keep the phase zero and it works.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_05
 And I mean, there is research that's been published showing, you know, speech reconstruction from the...

0:17:32	SPEAKER_05
 Essentially, the spectrogram without phase information.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_03
 Right, right, right.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:17:36	SPEAKER_03
 Base, again, is a bit different because they are doing this in a frequency domain.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_03
 But this is in time domain.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_05
 Yes, but I mean, you can reconstruct the entire...

0:17:49	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_03
 The spectrogramming.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_03
 Spectrogram from that, can't you?

0:17:53	SPEAKER_03
 So you could do it that way.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_05
 Because I'm just thinking, there's a heap of options.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_05
 Like, if you'd exactly the same with sinusoidal coding or something like that, all you need is the reconstruction of the spectrogram in order to estimate the harmonic amplitudes.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_05
 Exactly.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_03
 And then, what we can also do very simply is just to get the magnitude spectrogram using this approximation without the carrier, just Hilbert envelope.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_03
 But you just get it in this way, in the way of routes, right?

0:18:20	SPEAKER_03
 But you can also get the short time Fourier transform...

0:18:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_03
 Just by ray-filling.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_03
 Just classical frame-by-frame algorithm 20 milliseconds.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_03
 But you keep just the phases instead of magnitude.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_03
 And you can put this together.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_03
 And if it works pretty well, then the signal is not just whispered.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_03
 And you really hear that there is the voiceness in the signal.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_03
 But of course, the quiet is not so good still.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_03
 But you can use it for like two, three kilobits per second.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_03
 And it works.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_05
 But that's the big thing at the moment, isn't it?

0:18:56	SPEAKER_05
 If you're...

0:18:58	SPEAKER_05
 Like, yeah.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_05
 If the...

0:18:59	SPEAKER_05
 If the encoding writes two kilobits per second for the...

0:19:03	SPEAKER_05
 The excitation component of the signal.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_05
 It doesn't matter how efficient your encoding of the spectrogram is.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_05
 You're always going to have a high, relatively high bit, right?

0:19:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, sure.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_03
 Anyway, so maybe it would be nice if you'd...

0:19:25	SPEAKER_03
 If you'd...

0:19:25	SPEAKER_03
 So what you did with the speech coding, because...

0:19:29	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't see any of PhD thesis of you.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_03
 If you did something.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe it would be interesting at least to you.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_05
 So, well, one could argue it's a field that's quite a sort of a niche these days, isn't it?

0:19:44	None
 Yeah.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, sure.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah, but it's more towards industry than standards.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_02
 Because I worked in a industry for like a small time, but there they used to implement all these coders, GSM and ITU standards.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_03
 So you were...

0:19:58	SPEAKER_03
 When did you do that?

0:20:00	SPEAKER_02
 No, just before my PhD.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_02
 I worked for like a few months.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but the industry is really a big deal.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 Like so they work on a lot of these standards.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_02
 I think so, yeah.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_02
 What did you say?

0:20:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_02
 But mostly they're all based on self-paranalic milli.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:20:16	SPEAKER_05
 Is it Nokia's being sued in the US for their try band usage?

0:20:22	SPEAKER_05
 Because...

0:20:23	SPEAKER_03
 You mean using that CDMA?

0:20:26	SPEAKER_03
 No, no.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_03
 JSM?

0:20:28	SPEAKER_05
 JSM because I don't have GSM in the US, or they didn't have GSM in the US.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's not GSM right.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_03
 CDMA is another level, I think.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_02
 No, CDMA is there, but now slowly they're introducing GSM also.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_02
 Well, let's try band.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, GSM privately.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_02
 Frequencies are different.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, exactly.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_05
 And apparently Nokia's a bit of trouble over that one, but...

0:20:51	SPEAKER_05
 That's interesting.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, now it's really big competition.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_03
 I think there is a lot of money in that way.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_03
 Right, there should have been a lot, yeah.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_03
 Like speech recognition, of course, it's very interesting, but people don't use it so much as...

0:21:02	SPEAKER_03
 Well, that's...

0:21:03	SPEAKER_03
 Just coding, just telephoning, right?

0:21:05	SPEAKER_05
 I mean coding is a much more sort of standard...

0:21:08	SPEAKER_02
 It's a whole...

0:21:09	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, it boils down to just mathematics.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_05
 It's a lot of...

0:21:13	SPEAKER_00
 Right, yeah.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't...

0:21:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_05
 It's just sort of...

0:21:18	SPEAKER_05
 It's...

0:21:18	SPEAKER_05
 You know, communications.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_05
 Right, right.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_05
 Sort of...

0:21:22	SPEAKER_05
 No, yeah.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_02
 So where do you think your thing is useful in CDMA or JSM?

0:21:26	SPEAKER_02
 No, I...

0:21:27	SPEAKER_02
 I think maybe in CDMA it may be...

0:21:28	SPEAKER_02
 Well, what they were thinking about is...

0:21:32	SPEAKER_03
 CDMA, I mean, there is...

0:21:34	SPEAKER_02
 Or time domain that they're doing only...

0:21:38	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the problem is this with this application, or it doesn't have to be problem, but one constraint is that we are processing one second of the signal.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_03
 You can go down, of course, but then you are losing a little bit of the bit, right, let's say.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sure, sure.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_03
 So, but there are many applications where you really can use it because you don't care about algorithmic delay.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_03
 One second algorithm delay, like for...

0:21:57	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if instead of SMS you can really have some other channel.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sure, sure.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_03
 Because you're talking stuff like that.

0:22:04	None
 Right.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:22:06	SPEAKER_05
 And I mean, as you say, I mean, the delay is...

0:22:09	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, you can squash that delay to some extent.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_05
 Right, right.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, I think as far as the delayless coding goes, I don't think you can probably do much more than what's already been achieved, because to get higher compression you have to...

0:22:24	SPEAKER_05
 You know, take advantage of redundancy over longer times fans.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_05
 But even though...

0:22:30	SPEAKER_02
 But even though they...

0:22:30	SPEAKER_02
 These long telephones, they already have delay, at least half a second.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, sure, but I mean, that's transmission delay.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_05
 Not algorithmic delay if you add those together, you end up with a...

0:22:39	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_05
...night mess.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_05
 No, yeah.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_02
 But mobile...

0:22:44	SPEAKER_05
 We might have someone else joining in on a meeting soon.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_05
 That's nice.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, you tried SonyaSoidal coding, those approaches, didn't you?

0:22:54	SPEAKER_05
 Which one?

0:22:55	SPEAKER_03
 SonyaSoidal coding.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_03
 But the SonyaSoidal coding is usually, at least what I think or what I know is, when you are doing SonyaSoidal coding, it means you just take the speech signal at the beginning, right?

0:23:09	SPEAKER_03
 And you are trying to find...

0:23:12	SPEAKER_02
 Homonics and...

0:23:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, to find the harmonic in a temporal domain, right?

0:23:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, for that.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but I mean, the thing is, you need...

0:23:19	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, part of the parameter set for that is the harmonic amplitudes.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_05
 Now, one way of compressing the harmonic amplitudes is just storing the smooth spectrum.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_05
 And then...

0:23:34	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, yeah.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_05
...you can interpolate.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, you can just pick the harmonic amplitudes on that spectrum when you reconstruct.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_05
 On that smooth version of the spectrum.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_03
 More or less I did it, maybe the firm way, but...

0:23:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, I just...

0:23:46	SPEAKER_03
 Kind of regretting like, okay, trying to find out the strongest or the most dominant peaks in the spectrum, which is more or less the same.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_02
 But maybe the bit rate is the problem, not like, what can we do?

0:23:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, why...

0:23:55	SPEAKER_02
...it's really...

0:23:56	SPEAKER_05
 But it's quite high, I've been right, but I mean, once again, it may be it's something that's scalable.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_02
 But, yeah, maybe you can just see how many harmonics...

0:24:04	SPEAKER_02
 He was using 20, I think, like, maybe you can try to reduce...

0:24:06	SPEAKER_05
 Although, I mean, you can use as many harmonics as you want.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, he was just using the fundamental...

0:24:11	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, frequency.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_05
 And if you're doing a smooth spectrum representation of the harmonic amplitudes, then you only need to store the fundamental frequency.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_02
 And then all this amplitude.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_05
 And the maximum voice frequency.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_05
 And then you do multiples of...

0:24:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sure.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, yeah.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_05
 So...

0:24:27	SPEAKER_05
 And then the tricky...

0:24:28	SPEAKER_05
 The only tricky thing that we hadn't figured out was the phase information.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_02
 You take in.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_05
 But you can still get A, like you get...

0:24:37	SPEAKER_05
 Basically, if you do phase unwrapping and all of these other tricks, you end up with some sort of phase representation, which is...

0:24:43	SPEAKER_05
 Some kind of...

0:24:43	SPEAKER_03
...some sort of monotonically decreasing...

0:24:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_03
 If it's unwrapping, unwrapping.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, unwrapping.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_05
 So, I mean, it's something that you can, saveably represent in some sort of...

0:24:54	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_00
 Some functions.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_00
 Low sort of...

0:24:57	SPEAKER_00
 You know, low bit right representation, I guess.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_05
 And then maybe you'd need some sort of correction to correct minor phase discontinuities at some point in time.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_03
 I also play with that.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_03
 And for example, what I found is that, in this case, we are not trying to encode the speed signal.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_03
 We are trying to encode some carrier, which is much easier, I would say, because you can see that even.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_03
 So, where I was trying to encode the phases, so I just found that two bits is enough for that, and you really don't hear the difference.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_03
 So, if you keep all the spectral lines...

0:25:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_03
...as they were there.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_03
 But you are just quantizing with two bits, or three bits for amplitude, two bits for a phase.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's okay.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_03
 The problem is that you have to transmit many of them.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_03
 Because there is not just one domain component, but usually more others, which are quite small.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_03
 Or what you have to do, then you have to decrease the size of...

0:25:55	None
 The size of...

0:25:55	SPEAKER_03
 The size of...

0:25:55	SPEAKER_03
 Not one second, but you have to go down, because then you can get just voice part and a voice part.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_03
 You know, one second is usually mixed, right, somehow, together.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_02
 But you don't do any voice and voice decision.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_02
 No, no.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_02
 No, no.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_00
 You don't even have advantage, I think.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_02
 You want to avoid half choices.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_02
 We don't want to do that.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_02
 Because in same subtle modeling, it's really another issue.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that's one of the big problems with the whole piece, say 10 frames.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_02
 It stinks, because it's hard.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_02
 And then you have to combine all these harmonic model and noise models.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_02
 So again, you may end up some joining.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_03
 But for example, what we also found is that if you use just the Herbert envelope, that one, which is trying to approximate that in some terrorist energy, in some low band, like around 200 Hertz.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_03
 And you take a look on the signal on the trajectory.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_03
 You can see that it works like kind of voice detector.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, sure.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_03
 Because for low energies, there is usually noise for high energies.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_03
 There is kind of harmonicity.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_03
 So it works pretty well for that.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_03
 So we might use this one.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_05
 But that 200, this is what they use.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_05
 Like, they do use this for pitch marking in speech.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_05
 So this is what Ellen Black's code uses.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_05
 But it's very speaker dependent on what sort of bandwidth you look at this Hilbert envelope.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_05
 Depending on the pitch, depending on the person, you'll get a different amount of smoothing at a certain sort of...

0:27:19	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_05
 So I mean, if it's a female speaker, for instance...

0:27:23	SPEAKER_05
 That's true.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_02
 So you have to tune a lot of parameters like that.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_03
 That's a problem.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_02
 But anyway, you don't really need hard decisions.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_02
 Not like voice to voice.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_02
 Oh.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_02
 Oh.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe it may help everybody.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_02
 That would be nice.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_03
 Not to have anything like that.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_05
 But from memory, that basic script that they had wasn't very effective.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, maybe if you did some sort of initial first guess, and then...

0:27:48	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_05
 And then chose your smoothing factor based on that.

0:27:51	None
 Yeah.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_05
 Because selecting any particular point of what the pitch is at the point is might be inaccurate.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_05
 But if you're estimated at over a second, you should be able to get a decent estimate on something.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_02
 But do you really need it or like voice to voice?

0:28:06	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I don't know.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe if we really want to improve the quality, then we will need it.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_02
 But it's not really...

0:28:13	SPEAKER_02
 You don't need to specify at each point.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_02
 It's voice.

0:28:15	SPEAKER_03
 But now, yeah.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I'm going to have a time next month or in three weeks.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_03
 So I'll try to play some examples there.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_05
 It'll be nice to really see what this...

0:28:27	SPEAKER_05
 What you're actually trying to reconstruct here.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_03
 What we are trying to reconstruct...

0:28:32	SPEAKER_05
 This carrier signal, what it really...

0:28:34	SPEAKER_05
 How does it look like...

0:28:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_05
 And you did say it looks like a frequency modulator...

0:28:39	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_05
 How it's not?

0:28:40	SPEAKER_03
 It's kind of not the frequency, let's say amplitude modulation, where you have just the carrier and the modulation now.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_02
 And then amplitude.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_02
 But you're changing even frequencies also shifting, you don't have to make a picture.

0:28:55	None
 Yeah.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_02
 Exactly.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_02
 So then, yeah.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_02
 Then it's not the exact length to the modulation.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_02
 So it can be...

0:29:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_02
 It's in between.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_02
 It's in between.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_02
 So it's not this or that, but...

0:29:04	SPEAKER_03
 Still, yeah.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_03
 But anyway, what...

0:29:07	SPEAKER_03
 Also, the another approach, which is possible to use...

0:29:10	SPEAKER_03
 The another is one to keep the face like this.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_03
 One, two spectrograms, one the face, one the magnitude.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_03
 And, well, I can again play it.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_03
 And it works on two kilobits per second.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_02
 That's what Mario's did, but he was keeping on the face.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_03
 No, he was doing...

0:29:24	SPEAKER_03
 He was using a four-speed recognition, what I...

0:29:27	SPEAKER_03
 No, but even then he's...

0:29:27	SPEAKER_02
 For sure.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_02
 He didn't do anything.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_02
 He just transmitted it.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_02
 That's why...

0:29:32	SPEAKER_02
 He was aiming for...

0:29:33	SPEAKER_02
 Speech coding, I mean?

0:29:34	SPEAKER_02
 He's not really kind of doing speech coding, but he wanted to do it on music.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_02
 So he doesn't really care about the bandwidth.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_02
 He wanted to have the quality.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_02
 But even especially the audio CDs.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_02
 That's why he was telling me, like, at least even 10k bit, 20 kilobits also is okay.

0:29:52	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_02
 But he's not touching face at all.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_02
 I think he's just transmitting all the face and then...

0:29:59	SPEAKER_02
 Well, for example, this face...

0:30:00	SPEAKER_02
 But he's encoding the envelope.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_03
 There are more papers which are using this approach, like trying to encode the magnitude spectrum.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_03
 And then leaving the face.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_03
 Leaving the face.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_03
 Or you just really can...

0:30:13	SPEAKER_03
 Again, the face can be replaced by the noise, which is pretty good.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_03
 So that's the bandwidth variable approach.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_03
 So if you really don't have a bandwidth, you just can replace it by noise and it works.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, then it doesn't sound as the original because it's more whisperate or whatever.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_03
 But you can answer well.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_03
 And for example, if you mention this one, approach with the trajectory of the face.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_03
 So, if I'm a face trajectory, I also use because you can do it here.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_03
 When you get into this domain where you apply, or you are trying to compute power spectrum in order...

0:30:51	SPEAKER_03
 Let's say that this is kind of trajectory.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't fit this in frequency or time domain.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_03
 But here you are trying to compute, or doing a...

0:30:59	SPEAKER_03
 To do linear prediction.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_03
 So we are just doing FFT, right?

0:31:03	SPEAKER_03
 Then applying power in order to get...

0:31:08	SPEAKER_03
 To power domain and then IFFT, right?

0:31:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_03
 So you get the autocorrelation coefficient.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_03
 So before you are applying power spectrum, you can again get the...

0:31:19	SPEAKER_03
 You have the complex...

0:31:20	SPEAKER_03
 The frequency or complex spectrum, you can get the face, right?

0:31:24	SPEAKER_03
 And the face looks quite similar like this.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_03
 So you might see it's more or less like a line.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_05
 And it does start to get a little bit...

0:31:33	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_05
 Nom linear towards the end, but normally that's when the components are not actually probably going to be audible anyway in voice space, right?

0:31:40	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_02
 But this face is different from your career.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it is very different.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_02
 Because you're just doing on your...

0:31:46	SPEAKER_03
 You are doing in different domain.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. And those are the main things in time.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_01
 And it is quite...

0:31:52	SPEAKER_03
 It's quite sensible to any quantization, what I found.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_03
 Really, it looks like the line.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_03
 So you just say, okay, let's put the line there, but it doesn't work.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you can understand, but...

0:32:02	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sure.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_03
 You can hear that there are many...

0:32:04	SPEAKER_05
 Because any sort of error in that line is...

0:32:07	SPEAKER_05
 Is transmitted...

0:32:08	SPEAKER_05
 Is realized in it as a visor, right?

0:32:10	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_03
 And the other problem is that it's not bandwidth variable.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_03
 So you cannot say that this part will be just the noise.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_03
 Which you can do here in this error approach.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_03
 So that's why I didn't play with that so more.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_03
 Because I found there are more...

0:32:25	SPEAKER_03
 Design event features than the other entities.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_03
 Disapproves.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_03
 So that's why.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_02
 But even you can use that face directly.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_02
 You mean this one?

0:32:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, this is like just the original face.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_02
 But this is face of your spectrum.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_02
 Like it's not the time to...

0:32:39	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's not a face.

0:32:42	SPEAKER_03
 Of your signal, it's not...

0:32:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_02
 So then it's face...

0:32:44	SPEAKER_03
 It's not tricky, like how...

0:32:46	SPEAKER_03
 No, you can again put that envelope with this face together.

0:32:49	SPEAKER_03
 Because I love this.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_02
 But still you get only the magnitude of your Hilbert envelope.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_02
 No, you have...

0:32:54	SPEAKER_05
 No, you get the...

0:32:55	SPEAKER_05
 Five slasters like...

0:32:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you get the complex spectrum with this.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_02
 No, but you started with Hilbert envelope.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_02
 No, like magnetic...

0:33:02	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, I started with the...

0:33:05	SPEAKER_03
 magnetic...

0:33:05	SPEAKER_02
 DCT.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_02
 No, before DCT, you're...

0:33:08	SPEAKER_03
 No, after DCT, you're trying...

0:33:11	SPEAKER_03
 This is a kind of, again, real trajectory, right?

0:33:14	SPEAKER_03
 And you're trying to first find that Hilbert envelope.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_03
 So, as...

0:33:19	SPEAKER_02
 So you input to the DCT's, the speech or like your...

0:33:22	SPEAKER_02
 This is a speech.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_02
 Just starting with...

0:33:24	SPEAKER_03
 No, but here what I want to say is really that...

0:33:27	SPEAKER_03
 It's not part of Hilbert envelope.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_03
 It's part of the DCT's, you know.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, cool, cool.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:33:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, maybe it's then...

0:33:33	SPEAKER_03
 It's enough.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_03
 If you have just this face and the Hilbert envelope, you can put it together.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_03
 You don't need the career.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, this is kind of a career signal, but in different domain represented.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_02
 It's in frequency domain.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_03
 So, what I think is that we really need to apply kind of an honest, bicentre-essive approach in order to get something...

0:34:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that makes sense,

0:34:02	SPEAKER_05
 because it's a term domain sort of... Right.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_05
 Approach.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_05
 And I mean, and in fact, I mean, it's what you're doing is so different to most approaches to speech coding that it doesn't matter that we don't know much about.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_05
 No!

0:34:16	SPEAKER_05
 I haven't had much.

0:34:17	SPEAKER_05
 You mean...

0:34:17	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, it's quite different to a lot of the traditional sort of...

0:34:21	SPEAKER_05
 Sort of, you know, sort filter type, and approaches or...

0:34:25	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, different types.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_03
 Right, right.

0:34:27	None
 Yeah.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_03
 But I mean...

0:34:29	SPEAKER_03
 No, I think...

0:34:29	SPEAKER_03
 That's maybe even the advantage here, because you...

0:34:32	SPEAKER_03
 It's not speech-based, which means...

0:34:35	SPEAKER_05
 It's just a matter of minimum distortion type.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_03
 So you can...

0:34:40	SPEAKER_03
 When I tried and comparing with RPC-10 on a...

0:34:44	SPEAKER_03
 twice bigger or higher bitrate, this work works better, it seems to me.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_03
 Just for unvoiced speech.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not mentioning...

0:34:52	SPEAKER_03
 Unvoiced speech.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_05
 Unvoiced speech is very difficult to...

0:34:56	SPEAKER_05
 sort of judge quality compared to the way it's sitting.

0:34:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but when you hear and try to hear some examples with the music, for example...

0:35:04	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, plosives are very important, I guess.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_03
 Right, yeah.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_05
 So maybe it does a better job of plosives.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_03
 Mm-hmm.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_03
 That's true, yeah.

0:35:12	SPEAKER_03
 Why, anyway, it seemed to me pretty good.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_05
 It'd be nice if we had some demos here.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_05
 That's true.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_05
 That's the first time I'd have to wait your time, I guess.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_03
 So, in its your time?

0:35:22	SPEAKER_03
 I should be 13th December.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, I think.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, it's a little one.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, bugger.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_03
 I just...

0:35:27	SPEAKER_04
 You'll be coming over here.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_04
 You won't be here.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_04
 No, I...

0:35:31	SPEAKER_05
 You'll practice it before then, won't you?

0:35:33	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. Now, I just swapped it with Mike Pero, I think, because he's not going to be here this time.

0:35:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, he's going to us.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_03
 And I was supposed to have it in January, so...

0:35:44	SPEAKER_03
 Whatever.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_03
 Anyway, so...

0:35:49	SPEAKER_03
 But anyway, I wanted to hear something maybe from you, what you were doing with speech coding, because you mentioned that.

0:35:55	SPEAKER_05
 I did, yeah.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_05
 But we're doing a more traditional...

0:35:59	SPEAKER_05
 Bay frequency slices rather than temporal based stuff.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_03
 Bay was based on, like, you were using kind of regularizer there, right?

0:36:05	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, well, that was one of the approaches, sure.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, and the other approach was this HMM based stuff, which is basically just a parameterization of the...

0:36:15	SPEAKER_05
 You know, the source filter type parameters, and then learning the training like a speech recognition system.

0:36:25	SPEAKER_05
 But that's not terribly...

0:36:27	SPEAKER_05
 That's got no relationship to this.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's different, but speech coding.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sure, speech coding.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_05
 I read some of the other techniques.

0:36:37	SPEAKER_05
 Or standards, but...

0:36:40	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, I think you're on the right track with...

0:36:42	SPEAKER_05
 No, I'm supposed to have synthesis, but...

0:36:44	SPEAKER_05
 That doesn't tell you how, what sort of bit writes you're going to achieve or...

0:36:48	SPEAKER_05
 Right, yeah, sure.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_05
 And because you have to do it separately for H...

0:36:53	SPEAKER_05
 Band, band, right.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_05
 It would be the...

0:36:57	SPEAKER_05
 I imagine that's the tricky part.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, because it would be varying quite rapidly, wouldn't it?

0:37:02	SPEAKER_05
 Your...

0:37:03	SPEAKER_05
 Your codebook, like within each...

0:37:08	SPEAKER_05
 With different...

0:37:10	SPEAKER_05
 When you go along the one second sort of segment of the band, you...

0:37:15	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe what we can already do is to decrease this distance.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_03
 We can do a Hilbert envelope approximation with one second, but then we can split that signal into, I don't know, then segments.

0:37:29	SPEAKER_03
 We did 100 milliseconds or even less, and we can apply some another technique for that.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_05
 Well, first you've got to choose your approach and not worry about the bandwidth.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_05
 Right, exactly.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_05
 And then start thinking about how to...

0:37:41	SPEAKER_05
 Because I mean, I guess, especially because this is a more of a commercial-based project, you've got to match the quality before you start worrying about other things, right?

0:37:52	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, what sort of...

0:37:56	SPEAKER_03
 More or less, they don't care what will be the quality or the bitrate.

0:38:01	SPEAKER_03
 They just want to get something new, you know.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, I can't.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_03
 So if you get a very low bitrate with reasonable quality or really high bitrate, which is again different, but with high quality, they will be happy with both.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_03
 So, you know...

0:38:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, in the...

0:38:17	SPEAKER_03
 On one side, it's pretty good, but on the other side, you don't know which way you should go.

0:38:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sure.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_05
 And at the moment, you're at sort of a point where maybe you have to make that choice a little bit.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_03
 Right, right.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:38:33	SPEAKER_03
 Well, there you go.

0:38:37	SPEAKER_03
 Do you want to mention your speech-cleving experience?

0:38:41	SPEAKER_03
 So you're saying that you're doing something in India with...

0:38:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but it's mostly like this self and...

0:38:48	SPEAKER_02
 Do you know the self?

0:38:49	SPEAKER_03
 Like...

0:38:50	SPEAKER_02
 No, I was doing some writing some code for testing and these things, so I'm making some standards for that.

0:38:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, which is not...

0:38:59	SPEAKER_02
 So they're like...

0:39:00	SPEAKER_02
 The thing, these standards, how it works is like they give all the pseudo code kind of thing, and then they put severe test conditions.

0:39:08	SPEAKER_02
 So you have to pass those test conditions.

0:39:10	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:39:11	SPEAKER_02
 Then you can say, okay, we implemented these 70-

0:39:14	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, although standards, depending on what standard you're dealing with, sometimes it can be quite ambiguous, right?

0:39:20	SPEAKER_05
 I'm in a world like the Sempag standard that basically...

0:39:22	SPEAKER_00
 This is the container.

0:39:24	SPEAKER_05
 We don't care how you do it, right?

0:39:25	SPEAKER_05
 But it's got to fit inside this...

0:39:27	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:39:27	SPEAKER_02
 This sort of format.

0:39:30	SPEAKER_02
 Even the standards, they give the test signals also.

0:39:33	SPEAKER_02
 You can't really do it on whatever database you have.

0:39:36	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:39:37	SPEAKER_02
 And then you have to...

0:39:38	SPEAKER_02
 And then you have to do MOS testing.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's more like they define...

0:39:44	SPEAKER_02
 So I did for some, even a co-cancer also.

0:39:46	SPEAKER_02
 So they define what is the overlap speech condition, everything they define.

0:39:51	SPEAKER_02
 So you need to follow all those.

0:39:53	SPEAKER_02
 I see.

0:39:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:39:54	SPEAKER_02
 This industry is again different.

0:39:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but it's quite interesting even with current speech coding technologies.

0:40:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, they are still trying to use SALP or those IP...

0:40:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think they're using only...

0:40:08	SPEAKER_03
 There is nothing new, Morris.

0:40:09	SPEAKER_03
 And when I was listening to the talk of Milan, Italy, he's the Czech guy, but he lives in Canada.

0:40:18	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know the name of the university, but they have the pattern, I think, for KELP.

0:40:23	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:40:24	SPEAKER_02
 KELP is from Italy.

0:40:26	SPEAKER_02
 Not in KELP.

0:40:28	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know how it is exactly, but they got very...

0:40:30	SPEAKER_03
 The other SALP is famous for this, for itself.

0:40:34	SPEAKER_03
 What they did exactly, I don't know, if something different, a little bit or not.

0:40:37	SPEAKER_03
 Or they just keep those patterns or...

0:40:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:40:40	SPEAKER_03
 I don't have this exactly.

0:40:41	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe Hinné will know much more, but...

0:40:44	SPEAKER_03
 When I heard the presentation, they didn't do so much new.

0:40:47	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, it was last year.

0:40:49	SPEAKER_03
 I think Hinné was asking, so what's new that you are so famous with that?

0:40:53	SPEAKER_03
 Then they said, okay, we know exactly how to do that.

0:40:57	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, you know, not to make any errors, because everybody knows how to do that, but it's not so easy to implement it, right?

0:41:05	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:41:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:41:06	SPEAKER_03
 There is nothing so much new.

0:41:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, they've been seeing you in...

0:41:10	SPEAKER_05
 What's new is in the transmission medium, like...

0:41:12	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:41:13	SPEAKER_05
 You know, new, like, higher bandwidth transmission.

0:41:15	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:41:16	SPEAKER_05
 Or like, packet-ized-based transmission.

0:41:20	SPEAKER_05
 And then all that sort of thing.

0:41:23	SPEAKER_05
 Where they're not so much looking at the algorithm, but so much as...

0:41:26	SPEAKER_05
 How do we incorporate the algorithm within a new transmission sort of medium?

0:41:30	SPEAKER_05
 Basically, like, I mean, if you see a lot of papers on, like...

0:41:34	SPEAKER_05
 Like, voice over IP or whatever,

0:41:36	SPEAKER_00
 the publication is sort of like...

0:41:38	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, right. How do we deal with packet loss?

0:41:41	SPEAKER_05
 Or how is it affected by packet loss?

0:41:43	SPEAKER_03
 Right, right, exactly.

0:41:44	SPEAKER_03
 But then they are still using, like, error signal, which is going to be approximated by codebook, right?

0:41:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sure.

0:41:50	SPEAKER_03
 And linear prediction, which is approximating just the spectrum, four months and everything.

0:41:57	SPEAKER_03
 That's all.

0:41:58	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:42:00	SPEAKER_02
 And again, a lot of this stuff, like, even when I was working mostly, that company was developing for voice over IP.

0:42:06	SPEAKER_02
 So, they have to put all these things on, again, DSPs, and also it's mostly...

0:42:10	SPEAKER_00
 Right, yeah.

0:42:11	SPEAKER_00
 Out to how many...

0:42:12	SPEAKER_00
 All the other devices...

0:42:13	SPEAKER_02
 All the code, all that sort of stuff.

0:42:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, how many code?

0:42:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's still optimization.

0:42:16	SPEAKER_02
 And then...

0:42:17	SPEAKER_05
 But even that's less of a big deal now, right?

0:42:19	SPEAKER_05
 Because a whole little bit of a lot of...

0:42:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you can know...

0:42:21	SPEAKER_02
 Now even they're also becoming...

0:42:24	SPEAKER_02
 Even the memories are not really...

0:42:26	SPEAKER_02
 Not really.

0:42:26	SPEAKER_02
 You can throw MATLAB on them.

0:42:28	SPEAKER_02
 What am I about to find these days?

0:42:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, yeah.

0:42:30	SPEAKER_02
 I'm like an opera.

0:42:32	SPEAKER_02
 So even I think then you can have...

0:42:35	SPEAKER_02
 Whatever bandwidth...

0:42:38	SPEAKER_02
 It's not really...

0:42:41	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I hope that we still have a lot of time for that.

0:42:45	SPEAKER_03
 But no, I think...

0:42:46	SPEAKER_02
 But still then, that's why maybe people are going towards science order modeling, not like...

0:42:50	SPEAKER_02
 I've always before...

0:42:51	SPEAKER_02
 I think that...

0:42:51	SPEAKER_02
 Then the bandwidth conditions were really stringent, then they were using all the LPC base.

0:42:56	SPEAKER_03
 For example, when I was...

0:42:57	SPEAKER_03
 You know, harmonic noise modeling, that H&M system, which is using...

0:43:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, which is very good.

0:43:02	SPEAKER_03
 And small.

0:43:03	SPEAKER_03
 It's pretty interesting.

0:43:04	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, it's good.

0:43:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, even when you can look at his code and look...

0:43:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but don't always cut him for my minutes.

0:43:09	SPEAKER_05
 It wasn't perfect.

0:43:11	SPEAKER_05
 It was a little bit of bugs with some of the files matching, but it was pretty hard to tell that it was not perfect, unless you heard the samples sort of next to one another.

0:43:22	SPEAKER_05
 So that's not too bad.

0:43:24	SPEAKER_02
 But definitely it's better than code.

0:43:25	SPEAKER_02
 Or code is speech.

0:43:26	SPEAKER_02
 No different issues.

0:43:26	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, sure, really.

0:43:27	SPEAKER_02
 And I'm like, how much you can get compressed is.

0:43:31	SPEAKER_02
 Like what you're telling is you can do all these tricks.

0:43:34	SPEAKER_02
 The only trick is the files.

0:43:36	SPEAKER_05
 And we've got a student starting in January who's going to start working on how to actually efficiently parameterize the...

0:43:43	SPEAKER_05
 In sinus rule, modernity?

0:43:46	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:43:47	SPEAKER_05
 And I think we've got a number of ideas for the spectrum.

0:43:50	SPEAKER_05
 That's easily enough handle just using standard techniques.

0:43:53	SPEAKER_03
 But anyway, do you know exactly how it is done when you really have those amacicy coefficients, which means manual spectrum?

0:43:59	SPEAKER_03
 And then you are trying to reconcile the speech.

0:44:01	SPEAKER_03
 Without phase?

0:44:02	SPEAKER_03
 Without the phase.

0:44:03	SPEAKER_05
 I've got no idea.

0:44:04	SPEAKER_05
 Because I've tried...

0:44:06	SPEAKER_02
 You know, those...

0:44:07	SPEAKER_02
 I've used one paper like that.

0:44:08	SPEAKER_02
 I'm too confused about it.

0:44:09	SPEAKER_02
 No, yeah.

0:44:10	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe you can look at dates from...

0:44:12	SPEAKER_02
 Our streaming coffee.

0:44:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:44:15	SPEAKER_02
 Which one?

0:44:17	SPEAKER_02
 The University of East Anglia.

0:44:19	SPEAKER_02
 In the University of East Anglia.

0:44:20	SPEAKER_05
 But it's near sort of...

0:44:21	SPEAKER_05
 It's near the sort of Cambridge side of England.

0:44:26	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:44:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I can forward you.

0:44:30	SPEAKER_02
 There are a lot of tricks there.

0:44:31	SPEAKER_02
 Like there again, training, Gaussian mixers for different frequencies.

0:44:36	SPEAKER_02
 And then...

0:44:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but there are some opportunities.

0:44:38	SPEAKER_03
 But they're falling...

0:44:39	SPEAKER_03
 They're quite...

0:44:39	SPEAKER_05
 No, much more mathematical ones.

0:44:41	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:44:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:44:42	SPEAKER_05
 Just basically doing a search through...

0:44:45	SPEAKER_05
 Or stuff like that.

0:44:46	SPEAKER_05
 No, no, no.

0:44:47	SPEAKER_02
 Those things are again based on LPC.

0:44:49	SPEAKER_02
 No, maybe they're...

0:44:50	SPEAKER_02
 It seems to me, yeah.

0:44:50	SPEAKER_02
 Something like that.

0:44:51	SPEAKER_02
 It's like the pitch.

0:44:53	SPEAKER_02
 Estimation in X waves or these things.

0:44:55	SPEAKER_02
 You know what you can do?

0:44:56	SPEAKER_02
 Dynamic programming based on LPC and all this.

0:44:59	SPEAKER_03
 What you can do is take just the minimum phase of which you can get from linear prediction, right?

0:45:04	SPEAKER_03
 You know what I mean, minimum phase signal.

0:45:06	SPEAKER_02
 And then constraint.

0:45:06	SPEAKER_03
 It sounds quite reasonable in the two kinds.

0:45:09	SPEAKER_03
 But of course, it's not original at all.

0:45:12	SPEAKER_03
 So I don't know how they do that exactly.

0:45:15	SPEAKER_03
 I have no idea.

0:45:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, again, like...

0:45:17	SPEAKER_02
 No, the problem is different for everybody.

0:45:19	SPEAKER_02
 Like these guys were doing for distributed speech recognition mainly.

0:45:23	SPEAKER_02
 Right, right.

0:45:24	SPEAKER_02
 When you've only got the MSCC.

0:45:25	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, MSCC is so...

0:45:27	SPEAKER_05
 I think it was a deal with a raw or something.

0:45:30	SPEAKER_02
 A CTSA or something European standard.

0:45:33	SPEAKER_02
 For our only deal with anything.

0:45:35	SPEAKER_02
 Even it's kind of Aurora framework.

0:45:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but we didn't do any speech recognition.

0:45:40	SPEAKER_02
 But now it's a bit forward.

0:45:41	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, no, it was for say you've got someone who has...

0:45:46	SPEAKER_05
 You know, they want a dispute.

0:45:48	SPEAKER_05
 That this is what they actually said.

0:45:51	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:45:51	SPEAKER_05
 Like the recognition.

0:45:52	SPEAKER_05
 And the recognition network was wrong and UOMI money or whatever.

0:45:56	SPEAKER_05
 And then they can say, well, we've reconstructed your speech from the speech recognizer input to the speech recognizer.

0:46:03	SPEAKER_05
 Hey, voila, it sounds like you.

0:46:05	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, obviously there's a lot more to it than that.

0:46:07	SPEAKER_05
 There's a lot of sort of...

0:46:08	SPEAKER_05
 Well, does the quality stand up to legal sort of requirements or whatever.

0:46:13	SPEAKER_02
 But even at the simple point they're planning to use for standard GSM or this...

0:46:18	SPEAKER_02
 It's not that...

0:46:20	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, no, there's a separate set of standards I think for speech recognition.

0:46:23	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, ETS, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:46:26	SPEAKER_05
 Come here.

0:46:27	SPEAKER_05
 Which I think requires, you know, that states the information they can send is this.

0:46:33	SPEAKER_05
 So I don't know if you can actually tack on any extra phase.

0:46:37	SPEAKER_02
 You have to deal with what you're given.

0:46:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:46:40	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, all the standards are really...

0:46:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:46:44	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:46:44	SPEAKER_05
 I...

0:46:46	SPEAKER_05
 It would be interesting.

0:46:47	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, maybe that's the best approach to look at to begin with.

0:46:50	SPEAKER_05
 It's just pretend all you have got is...

0:46:52	SPEAKER_03
 You mean with this phase...

0:46:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:46:56	SPEAKER_03
 Sure.

0:46:57	SPEAKER_05
 Because you can also interpolate the pitch information from the spectrum as well.

0:47:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, they do some kind of reconstruction of pitch.

0:47:06	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:47:07	SPEAKER_05
 So I mean, maybe try to see how good you can go without transmitting any...

0:47:11	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:47:11	SPEAKER_05
...of that information.

0:47:13	SPEAKER_05
 But the quality again, from...

0:47:15	SPEAKER_05
 The pitch was really good.

0:47:16	SPEAKER_05
 I thought I didn't think you could really tell.

0:47:18	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no.

0:47:18	SPEAKER_02
 Again, Europe in standard for this, they give the MFCC's and they give the pitch.

0:47:23	SPEAKER_02
 Then you have to construct the thing.

0:47:25	SPEAKER_02
 But you have MFCC's then like, again, you have to get the high-row drum MFCC's and then...

0:47:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but the thing is, if it's male-scaled,

0:47:33	SPEAKER_05
 if you have a male-scaled, you get quite fine reconstruction of the spectrum at the lower frequency, which is what you make for reconstruction of the pitch anyway.

0:47:41	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:47:42	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:47:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:47:45	SPEAKER_05
 So I mean, if you wanted to transmit with fewer bands, you'd maybe still keep the lower bands or...

0:47:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:47:49	SPEAKER_05
 Or maybe you could still transmit the pitch, the pitch isn't that big of the upper.

0:47:53	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:47:53	SPEAKER_05
 It'd be nice if you didn't because then I mean, that's...

0:47:55	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I mean, it's worth giving it a go.

0:47:56	SPEAKER_05
 And then maybe saying, well, what information you can add to the data stream to improve performance.

0:48:03	SPEAKER_03
 Sure.

0:48:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:48:06	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:48:07	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:48:08	SPEAKER_04
 Thank you.

0:48:11	SPEAKER_04
 That'd be cool.

0:48:13	SPEAKER_04
 So how about you?

0:48:15	SPEAKER_01
 I've never done any coding in my life, so...

0:48:18	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just a...

0:48:19	SPEAKER_01
 I'm just a...

0:48:19	SPEAKER_01
 One curious, so this is coding then.

0:48:22	SPEAKER_01
 You call the speech then you're supposed to transmit the speech, right?

0:48:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:48:26	SPEAKER_01
 Let's say in GSM or something else.

0:48:29	SPEAKER_01
 I remember when I was doing some image processing, there were techniques for compressing, and then coding, so adding channel information on the image at the same time in order to save some bits.

0:48:42	SPEAKER_01
 You mean like...

0:48:42	SPEAKER_03
 You mean channel and source coding together?

0:48:44	SPEAKER_01
 Exactly.

0:48:46	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:48:47	SPEAKER_01
 I was just wondering if there's some...

0:48:51	SPEAKER_01
 Someone was doing it with speech as well.

0:48:53	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I can imagine kind of like JPEG operations which might be...

0:48:57	SPEAKER_03
 It was like source coding and we also channel coding because you're just smoothly or just...

0:49:02	SPEAKER_03
 Well, actually when you compress...

0:49:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well, first you compress the signal, right?

0:49:07	SPEAKER_01
 And then you add some complex signal in order to recover the error.

0:49:11	SPEAKER_01
 Right, right.

0:49:12	SPEAKER_01
 So I was wondering if by any chance there was something like this in speech with the speech?

0:49:17	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:49:17	SPEAKER_01
 You don't know?

0:49:20	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know so much about channel coding like those Hoofman coding stuff.

0:49:24	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, well, I mean...

0:49:26	SPEAKER_03
 Half-lands easy enough.

0:49:29	SPEAKER_03
 Just standard thinking.

0:49:30	SPEAKER_03
 It's not the most difficult.

0:49:32	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:49:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sure.

0:49:34	SPEAKER_05
 That's where I stop.

0:49:36	SPEAKER_05
 One length of cutting I'm out of here.

0:49:39	SPEAKER_02
 But I think again it's different.

0:49:40	SPEAKER_02
 Not like these standards again, all these Gs standards.

0:49:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, exactly.

0:49:44	SPEAKER_02
 They have the compression standards and the...

0:49:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, sure.

0:49:46	SPEAKER_02
 Coding standards.

0:49:47	SPEAKER_02
 But maybe...

0:49:48	SPEAKER_02
 And this was the problem actually because you were...

0:49:51	SPEAKER_02
 I don't remember anything like they're doing...

0:49:53	SPEAKER_02
 You come back.

0:49:55	SPEAKER_02
 Not in GSM definitely.

0:49:57	SPEAKER_02
 Even normal G7 to normal speech code.

0:50:00	SPEAKER_02
 So they have this speech coding standards again.

0:50:03	SPEAKER_02
 They have the channel code.

0:50:05	SPEAKER_01
 Then they have some...

0:50:06	SPEAKER_01
 Source.

0:50:08	SPEAKER_01
 So, yeah.

0:50:10	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:50:11	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, I think they do try to...

0:50:14	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, obviously the techniques they choose are supposed to be less susceptible to coding.

0:50:21	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, definitely.

0:50:22	SPEAKER_05
 But I mean, that's maybe the limit to that.

0:50:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:50:28	SPEAKER_02
 Again, yeah.

0:50:33	SPEAKER_02
 It's okay.

0:50:34	SPEAKER_02
 That's good.

0:50:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:50:37	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:50:38	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, thank you.

0:50:40	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:50:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, if you find some paper which you...

0:50:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I told you that.

0:50:49	SPEAKER_02
 That was the...

0:50:50	SPEAKER_01
 Fave.

0:50:51	SPEAKER_01
 Fave.

0:50:51	SPEAKER_01
 Fave.

0:50:52	SPEAKER_01
 Fave.

0:50:52	None
 Fave.

0:50:52	None
 Fave.

0:50:52	SPEAKER_02
 Fave.

0:50:53	SPEAKER_02
 Fave.

0:50:54	SPEAKER_02
 Now, waveform prototyping is different. I was suggesting like this.

0:50:57	SPEAKER_02
 But that's again, totally...

0:51:00	None
 Did you hear this?

0:51:01	SPEAKER_02
 Bashing claims.

0:51:03	SPEAKER_02
 You know really...

0:51:05	None
 Now, he...

0:51:05	None
 He was...

0:51:06	None
 He really...

0:51:07	None
 Found you again in speech coding like this.

0:51:09	None
 Where he proposed one prototype waveform.

0:51:13	None
 Like, they take the signal and then they project into two-dimensional and then they take the faces.

0:51:19	None
 And it's like prototypes.

0:51:20	None
 Kind of wavelets you can see.

0:51:22	None
 Like...

0:51:22	None
 But it's not exactly wavelets.

0:51:23	None
 So they take slow moving waveforms, slow moving signal, and like fast moving and then they combine.

0:51:30	None
 So it's like...

0:51:31	None
 So you project signal into two-dimensional space and then separate the slow moving parts and...

0:51:35	None
 Wow.

0:51:36	None
...fast moving...

0:51:36	None
 Kind of tips towards something like that.

0:51:38	None
 No, this is a...

0:51:39	None
 They operate a...

0:51:40	None
 Yeah, it's...

0:51:42	None
 So now people mostly use it for like residual and coding.

0:51:48	None
 So even...

0:51:49	None
 So if you have the LPC then you can use this technique for residual...

0:51:53	None
 Oh, that's quite interesting.

0:51:54	None
 Yeah, yeah.

0:51:55	None
 So...

0:51:55	None
 It would be good for me.

0:51:57	None
 You can really good qualities with four-loop.

0:52:00	None
 So there was the waveform coding which you...

0:52:02	None
 You can rotate me, the prototype coding paper.

0:52:06	None
 But did...

0:52:07	None
 So people can use at waveform level or at residual level.

0:52:11	None
 If you have a LPC you can use at residual rate, consider residual as some signal.

0:52:15	None
 So it's really...

0:52:16	None
 Same residual you can clearly see whether it's fast moving...

0:52:19	None
 Yeah, yeah.

0:52:20	None
 For your disposal...
