0:00:00	SPEAKER_01
 and then where's the other one?

0:00:29	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, here.

0:00:36	None
 Okay.

0:00:39	None
 Okay.

0:00:40	None
 Everybody ready?

0:00:43	SPEAKER_01
 I think so.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_01
 I think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves.

0:01:01	SPEAKER_01
 That's a good plan.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_01
 And his name and what your function is.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe we start with you.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_02
 My name is Francina and I'm a user interface.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_02
 My role is the main responsibility user interface.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_02
 And my role is to design a television remote control.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_00
 And I'm a marketing person.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_00
 I want to figure out how to sell them.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_01
 And your name is?

0:01:28	SPEAKER_00
 My name is Eileen.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_03
 I'm Januhi.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_03
 My role is industrial designer.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_03
 And my responsibilities are to deal with the technical functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_01
 Very good.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_01
 And as you already know, I'm Betsy.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_01
 I'm the project manager for today.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_01
 So why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really use and see what we really are supposed to do.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:02:00	None
 Yes.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_01
 Opening, Quaintance, tool training.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the tools, I think we already, I guess the tool is really our, the computer.

0:02:11	SPEAKER_01
 As far as I can see, each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_01
 Project plan that falls under the same heading pretty much.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think we have any great discussion at this point.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_01
 Here is what this thing should be.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_01
 This thing we are going to design is a new remote control should be original.

0:02:39	SPEAKER_01
 Trendy.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_01
 And of course, user friendly.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe you want to make some notes of that.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_01
 Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve.

0:03:26	SPEAKER_01
 That is, it's going to be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what we have come up with.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_01
 The same goes for the conceptual design.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_01
 There will be individual work and then discussion afterwards.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_00
 Same thing basically.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_00
 Through different types of design that we're going to be concerned about.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_00
 I can't write this this thing.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we should redesign it.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_01
 After we finish the remote control, we'll get to that.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_01
 We'll try to write the whiteboard but it's going to control the favorite animal.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_01
 Does anybody want to go and see how the whiteboard works?

0:04:30	SPEAKER_01
 So that in case we have to in the next meeting present something on the whiteboard.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_01
 You want to go, Hylane?

0:04:38	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_00
 I'll see what I can do.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_00
 Without hanging yourself.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_00
 See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_01
 Remember you have to press so it works.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_00
 So that it works.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_00
 Well, traditional kitty cat.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, it's a fat cat.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_00
 I have a very fat cat.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_00
 It's like that.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_01
 And you're front-scene.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_01
 Just to see how it feels so that you have a little idea.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_01
 Am I supposed to wipe off that?

0:05:34	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, that's okay.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_03
 Get to that later.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to draw a snake.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_00
 I hope the kitty cat is hungry because I don't like snakes.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_01
 Here's a project finance which of course we all have to think about when we design this thing.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_01
 Selling price is supposed to be 25 euro.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_01
 Profit aim for the company is 50 million euro.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_01
 The market range unlimited meaning international.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_01
 And the production cost should not exceed.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_01
 Hopefully it should be less than 1250 euro.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_01
 So these are all the things of course to remember with a budget and when you design to materials cost etc.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_01
 Now the discussion I guess is does any one of you have experience with remote control?

0:07:09	SPEAKER_01
 We use them right every day.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_01
 And now having used in the remote control for years does anybody already have an idea?

0:07:22	SPEAKER_01
 Like things you didn't like with it, things you would like to change, things you would like to improve with this thing.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_01
 Any first ideas?

0:07:32	SPEAKER_01
 Do you like to be smaller, bigger, have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons?

0:07:40	SPEAKER_02
 You know, things like that.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, I feel that all the remote should be very compact.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_02
 Those which we get here nowadays it's very long.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_02
 And it should have multi-purpose like the remote control which we use for TV.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_02
 It should be used for some other purpose also like controlling the temperature inside the house for air conditioners or for heating system.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_01
 So it should be a multifunctional gadget that would control all your household machines basically.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_00
 About 12-50 euros per year.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_00
 Well, we know we get a really good sign or maybe we can do that.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_00
 We certainly can try to agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_01
 It should be something new. It should do something different than just what we have.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_01
 Now of course the other thing to think there is maybe the design.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_02
 It should be different. Almost all the remote.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_01
 Like for every show maybe it should be something trendy.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe in different colors or materials.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_01
 So shapes, right?

0:08:56	SPEAKER_01
 Like kidney shaped first better in your hand or something.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_00
 Friendly shape.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_00
 I think another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_00
 Because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them. They can't find it.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_01
 That is true. They put the newspaper or they put it behind the plant or whatever.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_01
 And they saw me the phone rings and they want to turn the TV off and they said, Why the hell is my remote control?

0:09:26	SPEAKER_01
 Or if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a sound or signal.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_01
 So it should either be flossed or light should blink.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_03
 A flossed signal with a flow signal.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it should have a light so that we can just recognize where it is.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_01
 Exactly. That's why I'm just saying throw signal meaning whether it's a people,

0:09:51	SPEAKER_00
 whether a light or a light. I think a good clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond. What should you have to do to make it beep or blink?

0:10:06	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. My idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden, in other words, if it's in a dark spot, meaning you know, like a newspaper is on top, a sweater is on top or it's behind a plant.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_01
 At that moment, it's like what you call it, the light sensors.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_01
 In that moment it has a sensor.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_01
 If it gets a certain darkness, it has a sensor and it gives out a signal.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_01
 Whether that be a light signal or a beep, I mean that we can discuss that later.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_01
 So the light sensor would activate the signal?

0:10:41	SPEAKER_01
 That's right. You have to have some kind of sensor.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_01
 I think voice or clapping, that's not specific enough.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_01
 I know they're the lamps and stuff. You can clap on and off.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_01
 But I think they only work to a certain degree.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_00
 But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_01
 Of course.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_00
 Because you're silly because people are silly.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_00
 Oh yeah, well, but then we can't help everybody.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if we were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table, you know, we had to move along.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_01
 But I think we have some good points to start with here.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, the next meeting will be in 30 minutes.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_01
 I think you all, did you get notices on your computer for this?

0:11:32	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so you got the notice.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_01
 The working design, I guess that's the function.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_01
 Who is this? Industrial designer?

0:11:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah. That's you?

0:11:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's functional.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_03
 Exactly.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_01
 So we're looking for a working design when we come back.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_03
 A working design, yeah.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_03
 It's a mechanical functional design.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_01
 And then the technical function, do you have the technical function?

0:11:58	SPEAKER_01
 So you're the working design.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_01
 So you have a working design and then a functional design.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_01
 And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirements specification, like friendliness and what we just discussed in general.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_01
 That would be your idea. And of course, price.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_01
 That it, that the price is a good price.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, the price is given, but that was...

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_01
 And you know, you will get specific instructions for that.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's the end of the show.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_01
 So we have, well, we have a time, two, three minutes.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_01
 Any questions at this point or suggestions?

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 I think basically, basically we'll get instructions to work with.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_01
 And if you have any questions, I guess you can...

0:13:07	SPEAKER_00
 I think I have enough to think about our next meeting.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_00
 How about you people?

0:13:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 Alright, well...

0:13:18	SPEAKER_01
 Then we see you in about 30 minutes and see what we can come up with.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, very good.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_01
 Oops.

0:13:40	None
 Okay.
