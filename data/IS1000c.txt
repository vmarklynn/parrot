0:00:00	None
 I'm being put out.

0:00:12	SPEAKER_02
 Right, first time this time.

0:00:14	None
 There it is.

0:00:20	SPEAKER_02
 There it is. There's nothing complicated, but I get it right every time.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a word just written for Matthew.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_00
 I'm really looking for it.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_03
 So I suggest we start a meeting without Matthew.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. He's obviously late for some reason.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_03
 Good. Today we will talk about conceptual design.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_03
 I hope we both did some work concerning the conceptual design.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_03
 This will be the agenda for the meeting.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_03
 I will take some minutes again.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_03
 We will have presentations of different team members.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_03
 And then try to come to the decisions about the concepts you have presented.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_03
 We have 40 minutes to complete this.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_03
 Who is this?

0:02:39	SPEAKER_00
 I think Matthew is important to me.

0:02:47	SPEAKER_00
 It's really a team project with a team. If someone is not here then we cannot make it.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_02
 I would say I value this file for my presentation.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_03
 You have presentation already?

0:03:19	None
 I'm seeing my light too.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_03
 So did you manage?

0:03:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, I sent you the slides.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_01
 I see them.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_02
 This is just a presentation on the trends that we are going to use to make the products stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_02
 We have to work out what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people want to buy it.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_02
 This is to do this.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_02
 We will not turn on the microphone.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_02
 We basically use some focus group surveys which I went through with the last time, the main results of that.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_02
 We have to work out what we can do to make it stand out.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_02
 We have to work out what we can do to make it stand out.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_02
 It is very different from everything else out there.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_02
 It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_02
 That was twice as important as the next item on here which has to be technologically innovative.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_02
 There is something else, apart from just the look at it, people have to think about it and say there is something there that I want.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_02
 That is a really cool feature and it has to make them want to buy it again.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_02
 Firm the list and innovative was twice as important as its last aspect.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_02
 It has to be easy to use.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_02
 They have to be able to look at and have some intuitive idea of how to use it.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_02
 Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment are fruit and vegetables.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_02
 This is basically talking about the feel of it.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_02
 Probably not the smell of it, but the bright colors eye catching really bold designs.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_02
 The spongy feel.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_02
 I had to talk to the design people about this but having a remote that is tactile that feels different.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_02
 That would be really cool.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_02
 That would make it stand out.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_00
 Can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said?

0:06:33	SPEAKER_00
 What is the feeling?

0:06:35	SPEAKER_02
 Well, not the spongy is the current thing.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_02
 The spongy is the current texture.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_02
 Basically there are no reports that are not the right to the moment which are spongy or tactile at all.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_02
 So if you make it maybe fairy or soft or something, it will be something that sits at the pan.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_02
 Rather than just be a plastic which they will all out at the moment.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_02
 So as far as design goes, the most important aspect was the design to the customers.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_02
 Going with the fruit and vegetable idea, we got the bright colors.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_02
 It makes it stand out.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_02
 The oranges and the bright yellows and the fluorescent colors.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_02
 Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_02
 They have a lot of them have the changeable covers so you can choose what color the outside is.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_02
 That is one way of looking at it.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_02
 Textured feel we just talked about.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe it is another way of doing that.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_02
 So if it is part of the changeable covers, maybe they can choose a different texture.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_02
 The spongy one or soft one or something like that.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_02
 So they can choose that as they want to.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_02
 That is a really good idea.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_02
 They are looking for a living room or a sports team or whatever.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_02
 And yes, still taking inspiration from mobile phone design.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_02
 So functionality, the way mobile phones work, the way the keypad looks.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_02
 Also, the way that a lot of industrial design has gone into mobile phones at the moment.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_02
 The big selling items.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_02
 People have put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage that.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_02
 And we can start using some of their ideas.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_02
 Back to technology innovation.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_02
 Not quite as important but still a big issue.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_02
 We talked about having a way of finding the remote control if it has been lost.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_02
 That is one thing we could look at.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_02
 There are other aspects like LCD screens and speech recognition which won't.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think my personal opinion going to be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that we will go into them.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_02
 I think we are better doing something basic like this which is very important and would be a really cool feature to put in.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_02
 Easiest.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_02
 I had no real specific ideas for this.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe just basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe by themselves.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe that you can get more information.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_02
 The finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_02
 That is the presentation.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_03
 Very clear.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_02
 So they don't have any comments or ideas on that?

0:09:20	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we can decide later on.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_03
 The look and feel of I was a good idea maybe to let the people choose.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, they are changeable covers.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_03
 But on the other hand I don't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete new line of supplies.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_03
 It would be very complicated organizational.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_02
 We are selling so many units of this.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_02
 This is going to be a mess market of product.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_00
 We need four to have two or three different designs at least.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_00
 A set of three or four different aspects.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_00
 That fits.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_03
 Of course it will be we get if it works.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_03
 We get after sales.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_03
 That would be very good.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_03
 Those covers could go for three, five euro.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_03
 That is a very good idea.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we can go as a few presentations.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_01
 We could discuss later.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_01
 We can put all the ideas together.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_01
 Together in the details.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_03
 You might have some information on the easy to use.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_00
 Your part is very related to mine.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_00
 When you suggest something that it has to be related.

0:10:52	SPEAKER_01
 I will go with that.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_01
 The idea of having a remote is that you have different keys and different structures, different forms.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_01
 They could be buttons or like triangle.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_01
 They could be of varying sizes if you want to basic name for size.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_01
 They could be more than other.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can have different colors.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_01
 For example, having the red for the on-off switching on and off the button.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_01
 This is a general trend to the method they do.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_01
 What I found was that the conventional, mostly that the TVVCR music system operated once.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_01
 They are very specific to each other.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_01
 But there are some common keys.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_01
 If you want to forward a VTR and if you want to forward a strong track.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_01
 You can have a common thing.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_01
 There is also speech recognition.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_01
 You can have multiple functionality.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_01
 You can program the keys if you want to certain keys or even the channel information.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_02
 The idea of having speech recognition for the name of the channel.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_01
 You can have a number of different keys.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_01
 As more and more channels come, you have more and more problems.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_01
 Even if you are in the channel, however, you still have the problem.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_00
 What functionality do you suggest for that?

0:13:25	SPEAKER_01
 It should be limited one.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_01
 In the present market, I saw that something like 80-word thing.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_01
 We shouldn't be that difficult to implement like 80-200 words.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_01
 Basically, you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_01
 You want to store your favorite channels.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, some 10-12 channel information. You don't want to store all the channels in that.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_01
 Basically, it depends on the remote with LCD display for browsing.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_01
 You have multiple functionalities.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_01
 For example, you are watching a movie and you are having a universal remote control.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_01
 You don't know which functionality is very important.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_01
 I am using the TV every time.

0:14:22	SPEAKER_01
 For example, I can use a simple toggle switch and a display.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_01
 I press it so that the display says, I am in TV or DVD or whatever it is.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_01
 Instead of having three keys, four or four keys, more of the functionalities will increase actually for you and you don't want separate keys for all of them.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_01
 There can be children friendly where you can program your remote so that they are not allowed to browse certain channels which you can block them and you can operate them.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_01
 These are the things presently which are seen in the market scenario.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_01
 Personally, I would look at things like having a universal remote is a good idea.

0:15:15	SPEAKER_01
 Instead of having individual ones for all of them, you can think of having multiple functionality.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_01
 Possibly with speech recognition, I got a mail from the coffee machine interface unit that they have integrated the speech recognition into the coffee machine.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_01
 If you say, hello coffee machine, it is a high Joe or something like that.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_02
 The coffee machine does not have too many words of using with that.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_01
 It is a limited vocabulary thing and maybe isolated word.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_01
 It is interesting and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys on display for the browsing which is again and maybe having something like a blinking thing.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_01
 It could indicate what is called the battery in your remote.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_01
 At the same time, if it is a dark room, it can be used to locate the remote also.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_00
 You want to let the user programming the keys, some of them.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_00
 You can let them do that.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_00
 It is not difficult.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if we still want the RC to be easy to use.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_01
 It depends on the easyness like the user how much effort he can put.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_01
 For example, I would like to store in certain way.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_01
 If you want to give the full freedom to the user or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with their constraint.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_02
 You can do it both ways.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_02
 You can pick it up and use it straight away without customizing it.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_02
 Or if they want to, they have the option of using these extra pages.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you can give hints to us because I am not sure whether we can implement that for 12-50 cents.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_03
 I am sorry to have every time I have to come down on a price again.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_03
 This might be a little limiting for your creativity.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_03
 It is a real... we have to consider it. Do you think this idea is my speech recognition?

0:17:56	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it is possible for 12 euro, then it will be at cost of other functionality.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_03
 We might implement the furry case of the...

0:18:10	SPEAKER_00
 I would say that for programming keys, it could be easily done within the package of 12 euros.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_00
 But for the ASR system, I am not sure if it is feasible to have this.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_01
 We can talk with the coffee unit and you can check how much.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_00
 If it is a low-over-covered read, it is already implemented.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can talk to them and we can come with that.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_01
 You can think of having a... since you have a...

0:18:49	SPEAKER_01
 You know something more, maybe if you add a little bit of even display, you may need to keep checking the battery.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_01
 So you need some kind of indicator.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_01
 So it could be a blinking option of LED.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_01
 It could actually be used to detect also.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_01
 If it is in a dark room, you can basically detect it also.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 Well, yeah, to be able to use the remote in the dark.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_02
 So either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or...

0:19:16	SPEAKER_01
 No, actually...

0:19:17	SPEAKER_01
 It is like... it can be for two purposes.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_01
 If you have a NLCD display and all those things, it is not going to be the standard remote.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
 Which is having... we need just six volts, sorry, three volts DC.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_01
 It may need more actually.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_01
 So you may need to check your battery usage.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_01
 And then you need that some functionality to indicate the battery limit.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_01
 And then if the battery limit is indicated, it could be indicated to a blinking something.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_01
 And it can change the color depending on how much is the battery.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that is good enough to even locate it even if you want to.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_01
 You know?

0:20:03	SPEAKER_01
 Very good.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so...

0:20:05	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if I have time to talk about...

0:20:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, you have time some more?

0:20:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, yes, you can.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_01
 Sure, you can, you know.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_00
 So what I'm going to present here is very...

0:20:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, basic knowledge about the components that are inside Rc and remote control.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_00
 And how is it manufactured?

0:20:42	SPEAKER_00
 What is the process?

0:20:43	SPEAKER_00
 It's to explain you.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_00
 So the method is...

0:20:48	SPEAKER_00
 There is a set of components in remote control, like everywhere.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_00
 And what cost...

0:20:56	SPEAKER_00
 The components in themselves do not cost a lot, but the way to assemble everything costs, obviously.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_00
 And I will show you my preferences at the end.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_00
 So there are two different types of...

0:21:16	SPEAKER_00
 different ways of using the components for making a remote control.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_00
 The basic way is to use an integrated circuit and some transistors, resonator resistors, that aims at communicating the message to send the message to the lead that will transmit to the receiver.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_00
 And either the components and the circuit board, boring buttons and for a lead, etc. for the components.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_00
 So it's not in finding just to say that the chip can detect when a key is pressed and then it translates to the key to a sequence, something like MOSCode, as you know, with the different sequence for each key.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_00
 And with the components we will use, we will have different messages, different sequences.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_00
 And the chipsense, that signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_00
 So electronic parts are assembled onto printed boards, because it's easier to mass produce an assemble.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_00
 So I think for our design we want some programmable VLSI or FPGA high technology.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_00
 And this is important, so we will use in any high tech devices a chip of fiberglass to solve them and connect them.

0:23:04	SPEAKER_00
 So my personal design, we need to find a solution.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_00
 What is the material of the cover we want to use?

0:23:15	SPEAKER_00
 If it's plastic or you said that you had some ideas like footwear or...

0:23:23	SPEAKER_03
 Well maybe we can give the case a very normal case, but with a changeable cover to fancy it up.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_03
 So like a normal chip plus the case, which can be covered up in, for instance, a wooden case.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, like they do it with cars, I think, inside the car.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_00
 So they also emailed me that they have available a bunch of different buttons, like squirrel wheels, integrated push buttons, such as a modern computer mouse.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_00
 And very cheap LCDs, so a liquid crystal display.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_00
 So I'm doing, I think, we might be able to integrate LCD into our RC.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_00
 And the final point is we have, yeah, there are some compromises to do.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip, but the squirrel wheel and that kind of higher high-tech stuff needs more money, which is a higher price range, right?

0:24:40	SPEAKER_00
 And the display requires an advanced chip, which in turn is more expensive, that we've got our chip, but I think with 12 euros, and if it's made for four million items, then I think we could be able to under that.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_00
 So to sum up, we need, yeah, so I just said that the components, the list of components has to be listed and assembly is an important process, it has to be taken into account.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_00
 And for the designing of the cover layout, then it's better to maybe see that with the UI expert, so that we can, it's really a team working.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_00
 So I cannot design something without your agreement, right?

0:25:40	SPEAKER_01
 Sure, of course, for example, I wanted to know, like if you want to have, if you want to have the LCD display over there, or if you want to store the programs with the keys, what kind of things you need inside your things?

0:26:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's kind of simple FPGA programmable device, and we have to insert.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_00
 I think we could insert one that could under the several functions of.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so in that case, you can even look at the technology, what the mobile phone is trying to use with the PGA card.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_01
 Exactly, yeah, for customizing.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, with that, actually.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_01
 How cost-effective it would be to put that card, chip into it and do that programmable things.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_03
 So I think we should come to some decisions now about this.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_03
 So I understand when we want this play, we need an expensive chip, but when we want a scrolling wheel, we also need the expensive chip.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_03
 So can we use the same chip?

0:26:54	SPEAKER_03
 With one expensive chip, we can implement several complicated or as far as future.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly, yeah, that's a very good idea.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_00
 We could have one main chip that could handle, it's called FPGA chip, that could under both like scrolling wheels, as well as LCD.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_03
 So when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is possible in the given budget, maybe we should go for the more expensive chip.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_03
 So all features which you mentioned can be implemented in the same chip.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_03
 Well, do you think that's feasible?

0:27:39	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if it will fit into our cost of 25 euro.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_03
 You think it's possible.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_03
 Is it possible to fit in it?

0:27:48	SPEAKER_00
 I think both if we had a budget of 20 euros, it would be okay.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_00
 But we need specific costings then,

0:28:00	SPEAKER_02
 actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is going to fit in our budget better. Yeah, that's an excellent idea.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_03
 When you make a design, you can next meeting, you can give an exact cost price.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because right now I don't have the price in head, but for next meeting I'm sure we have a good time.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_01
 That's something which I wanted to ask you also, what will be the cost of it?

0:28:29	SPEAKER_01
 For example, if you want to put wood, I wouldn't suggest for wood.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's much easier to use a plastic or a wood.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_01
 In the other than wood, it will be much more expensive, though it's the most natural thing.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, but I think we can just use more cheap plastic for basic addition than people can fancy it up with more expensive materials.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_03
 We can give the preference to them,

0:29:06	SPEAKER_01
 but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is, it's much better with that, rather than going for it.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_00
 It's a detailed plastic versus wood.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_00
 We need maybe to center our discussion on really what buttons, what functionality we want to offer to the user.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe with graphs, I don't know, as an user interface designer, you could maybe have a plus on that.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_03
 I think for next meeting we, you two can present a real design.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_03
 So drawing is on the board.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_00
 Perfect.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_03
 Then we now only have to decide the general function.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_03
 Let's say in next meeting you produce two designs.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, less advanced and more advanced than with the cost price.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_03
 Furthermore, we go for the basic plastic case, which can be laid fancy up with additional, how do you call them, these mobile telephones you can put a cover over.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_03
 But that can be done later.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_03
 We now can concentrate on the basic remote control.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_01
 We can give them smooth keys.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_01
 With bigger eyes so that you know, the problem most of the time you see in the case is that it's small.

0:31:02	SPEAKER_01
 Every time you have to be very, but if you go to a different ways of designing those keys, then you can merge them together.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_02
 Is there any of these you're looking at?

0:31:16	SPEAKER_01
 Actually, for example, if you see they're quite small over here.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_01
 Now you can, for example, as I was telling you, if you make them big, it may change the look of them thing also to the people at the same time.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_01
 It is more interesting for people who are having this RSI and all this.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_01
 Big keys, it's very good for them actually.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_01
 I agree.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_00
 Not too many keys, of course.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_02
 One I've had before, I remember I was at a home, there's actually a cover on the bottom, so the bottom bit is just half the keys most of the time.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_02
 And you can start the cover back to get to the more advanced keys.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_03
 But then you have still have, when you don't use it, you have such an extent of your remote control, which you don't use.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe it's possible, I don't know whether you can indicate this.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_03
 That you can ask to where, open your remote control and on the inside are buttons you don't use that much.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_02
 I've seen that before too.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_02
 Another like the, it flips up and then you've got another low button underneath.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so it's something like this, the model here.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_01
 But you can put the key in.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_02
 I've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_03
 That's what it means.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_03
 So I mean something like a book.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_02
 I like the shape of this one.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_02
 Can we have, think about maybe having a non-mortem, not non-mortem tagging on one.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_02
 So it's not just the straight little box.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe curved or something.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we need to make a decision on how big we want to be and how many buttons we should make.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_00
 Is this for the next meeting?

0:33:02	SPEAKER_02
 No, I think it might be our time.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_02
 Our time for this meeting.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, next meeting we should make two designs.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's different upon a second.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_03
 And then we can decide between those designs.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_01
 Perfect.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_03
 So anyone, any questions?

0:33:19	SPEAKER_03
 No, no.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_01
 I don't have.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_02
 So is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting?

0:33:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, I come to that.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe it would be interesting if you could look for the cost inventories of other devices if you're using the speed to the ignition or something like that.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, well, maybe I don't know more than this possible.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you can start evaluating their work somehow.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, is this made a designing away to evaluate it?

0:33:56	SPEAKER_02
 So I think you have had to set up test groups and things.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know whether that's possible in a given time, but as far as possible.

0:34:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:34:07	SPEAKER_03
 So you two will be together working on two prototypes.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_03
 And further instructions will be sent to you by E2.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_03
 Two or three prototypes.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_00
 Two.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_01
 One for the cost and the one with higher rent.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_01
 And then we can be reconpiring them.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_01
 And find a compromise between both of them.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_03
 Let's go all this way in.

0:34:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:36	SPEAKER_03
 Thanks, guys.

0:34:37	None
 Thanks.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_01
 So we have done...

0:34:40	SPEAKER_01
 For now.

0:34:43	None
 Oh, yeah.

0:34:53	None
 Oh, yeah.

0:34:55	None
 Yeah.
