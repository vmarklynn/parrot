0:00:00	None
 All right.

0:00:01	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you very much for coming to this third meeting of the design group.

0:00:21	SPEAKER_00
 I think we made some definite progress to the last one.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_00
 And come up with some interesting suggestions for our new remote control.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_00
 Again, very quickly, just present some notes of that meeting.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_00
 Now, the problem with existing remote controls we felt was that they were ugly and that people who prepared premium for something better.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_00
 There's got lots of buttons on them that people don't use and find difficult to learn and people lose them.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_00
 We thought that for our new remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy, that we should look at speech recognition rather than buttons.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_00
 And that if you have any buttons, there should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that the people use.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_00
 We want to go for a long lasting battery that we guarantee for the life of the product and a shape that will be instantly recognizable, A, as a trendy remote control, and B, as a real reaction product so that when people are happy with that, they will want to buy everything else from us.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_00
 So, again, we'll have the three presentations from the three of you and then we'll make a final decision.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_00
 And the decision that we need to make today find NER, what energy source we want to use, whether it is practical to use a long lasting one.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_00
 I think our discussion was around the fact that if we're going to go for a long lasting power supply then basically it's sealed for life.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_00
 If anybody has managed to run one down, we'll give them another one.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_00
 It will be prominently displayed as part of the advertising literature that it's for life, guaranteed for life.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_00
 Now, the internal chip, and this is where I need Kate's expert advice and given that this has to go to market as quickly as possible, do we go for a custom-designed chip or do we buy one off the shelf and program it ourselves?

0:03:20	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, I'm not an expert on these things, but presumably there must be loads of them already on the market that we can modify, but that's your area of expertise.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_00
 And then the overall design of the case is Kendra's field.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_00
 We had some discussions last time as to how we might go forward, and we'll finalise those today.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_00
 This is all linked in with the user interface, whether we go for voice buttons or a bit of both.

0:04:07	SPEAKER_00
 And then for the next meeting, Kate will be looking at the look, feel, and design, Kendra, how the user actually uses it, and of course the product evaluation.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_00
 Kate and Kendra will be producing a model for us to look at.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_00
 So if we can have the three presentations again, please, and perhaps we'd like to start.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_01
 Kate, what was I saying?

0:05:15	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, I'll just be talking about the components design.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, basically I just looked at what exactly do remotes do.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_04
 Basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command, and then this is translated into light signals, which are then seen by the TV.

0:05:37	SPEAKER_04
 The materials we're going to need to look at.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_04
 The two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery, and the integrated circuit chip works in conjunction with a diode, a transistor, a resonator, two more resistors, and a capacitor.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_04
 And the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_04
 Basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command, and this creates a connection within the remote.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_04
 And it allows the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in the Morris code format.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_04
 This signal is sent to the transistor, which amplifies it, and then sends it on to the light emitting diode, which is then changed into infrared light, which is sent to the TV and sort of seen by the TV, and which changes the channels.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_04
 So as for how we should end up using this in our remote, a couple of main questions are the buttons.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_04
 The fewer buttons you have, I guess the few internal connections and internal codes you're going to need.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_04
 However, to not have buttons, or to use a voice command instead of buttons, might make these connections more difficult and raise the production cost.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_04
 That's something we should think about.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_04
 Also, we have to work within the company constraints, and the company has informed me via email that there are experts at push buttons, and that seems to be the most cost-effective way of producing it.

0:07:18	SPEAKER_04
 Also, with battery connections, the company has some limits on the batteries we can use, so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a backup basic battery, and somehow between the combination of that two, we might be able to come up with something that will last the lifetime, or the five to ten years, and we could still keep that original idea.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_04
 We also need to look at the chips, custom-divine versus off-the-shelf, and the custom design will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all seem to have agreed upon.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_04
 However, that's going to cost more, but the off-the-shelf is going to be cheaper, and it's going to be allowed us to produce it quicker and get it out there faster, but it's going to be less flexible with the features, especially things like voice activation, which haven't really been used in the company.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_04
 There's not really chips out there, that would be easy to convert, so if we were definitely going to go with the voice option, we'd probably have to design our own chip.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_04
 That pretty much sums it up.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry, can you just put that one back up again, please?

0:08:35	SPEAKER_04
 I mean inevitably a custom design chip is going to be more expensive. Do we know by hand-notch?

0:08:36	SPEAKER_04
 I don't actually have any price information.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_00
 Do we know how long it will take to develop a custom chip?

0:08:44	SPEAKER_04
 A lot longer than an off-the-shelf chip. The problem is the voice technology is not really highly developed, it's still in an experimental form, so it's hard to predict the time.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_00
 Right, I think we need to make a decision here, given that the company wants us on the market quickly and cheaply, that would appear to effectively constrain us to an existing chip, unless they're for conventional button technology.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_00
 Before we go around, does anybody have anything to say about that?

0:09:26	SPEAKER_02
 I just have a question about that. Does it make a difference if there are just a few commands?

0:09:31	SPEAKER_02
 For example, if you can pre-program in numbers 1 through 10 and pre-program say 9 channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel 1, and then you've programmed in, say, BBC4 as your channel 1 as your favorites.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_02
 I'd like to have a certain number of favorites.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_04
 To incorporate the voice activation in it is sort of the trick. Once you've got the whole voice chip in there, then it's pretty much the world, the sky is your limit, but the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_00
 I find that it's surprising, given that mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_00
 This information is from the internal information.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_00
 Of course, mobile phones do tend to be more expensive.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_00
 Because mobile phones are expensive, you can't say it's the voice recognition that these, but we don't know.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_00
 Given that the technology is not well developed and given that it's never been done before, with the double risk, perhaps we ought to stick to two buttons.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_00
 Since the last thing we want to do is present a project that doesn't work.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_01
 Thoughts?

0:11:42	SPEAKER_03
 Another thought, oh sorry, go ahead.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_03
 I was just going to say that maybe we can cut cars somewhere else to bring them to the local cost.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_00
 Do we think the voice technology is fundamental to the project?

0:12:02	SPEAKER_04
 It's something we've discussed since the beginning.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_04
 I think in our minds it's fundamental, but I don't know that the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that.

0:12:37	None
 Thank you.

0:13:07	None
 Thank you.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_02
 I think we're going to have the voice recognition for the whole thing.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's a second most important aspect to you, so it should be technologically innovative.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_00
 If that means we've got four buttons, but I mean the same question, do we need the five buttons for channel change, up down, volume up down, and on off, just as a backup?

0:15:00	SPEAKER_04
 I would say we do.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, sorry, did you want to say anything?

0:15:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_01
 It's going to work.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so I did some research on the internet and what, you know, the user interface are just the aspects that are seen by users, commands and mechanisms for the operation, and they're just kind of a variety of choices.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_02
 So, a lot of times they tend to look cluttered, and these were just a couple examples of different kinds that are a little bit more unusual. There are some special ones available, like this one right here, which is marketed towards children, different designs, and one of the things that we need to watch out for is a V in volume because people, some of the other ones, I think a little picture of what I thought ours could look like.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_02
 So just kind of minimize the clutter, avoid too many buttons, and also one of the things that people have used is a slide button, like you have on a mouse, that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume, for example, have a slide button on the side, and then you can pre program the channel's voice recognition, and then the voice response sample, okay, to interrupt, okay, do you understand anything about slide controls? I mean, I think the reason they're used is push buttons is that they're simple, cheap, and I think they're about the same cost, really.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I think it's just sort of, there's a lot of slide buttons out there, I think it's pretty much the same sort of connection.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_01
 Fair enough, fine.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_02
 Just because I'm, for example, if I'm using a mouse, I like to be able to slide it up and down, so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it, and then have the up and down, and then the...

0:17:41	SPEAKER_00
 So there's three buttons in the slider.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_00
 Three buttons, the channel up there.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_03
 If you've got a channel up down, you'd have a slider on that as well, because if you know what's on the thing, it kind of like it's got kind of...

0:17:55	SPEAKER_03
 It kind of like sticks, I mean, up like one unit, if you're saying me?

0:18:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_03
 So it kind of goes up one, then you can keep rolling up, but it's like a cog or something, so you kind of take it up one at a time.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_02
 The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons on one side for the channel, and then the slider is that if you're just holding it in your hand and you pick it up, it's easy to know, okay, this is just a volume.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_02
 That's quite a lot of what you're thinking.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_04
 But it doesn't like pick up remote, so you're meant to change the channel and turn the volume, or the rest of it, so it would be kind of good to have and feel completely different.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_04
 You'd know what you were fiddling with.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think she'd have a bit of a mouse with that.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, this is what we have to come up with, is the actual shape that people instantly pick it up and know what it's going to do.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so we're looking at sliders for both volume and channel change.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I was thinking kind of just for the volume, but what do you guys think?

0:18:55	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know, depending on the final shape of it, because you could have like, I don't know, where it is there, it looks like you can control the volume with your thumb, and then you can control the buttons.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, in that kind of position, the fingers would be better for pressing.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I mean, it seems to me that it also has the advantage that the two are clearly different.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_00
 And there's no possibility of confusing the two.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_00
 So, okay.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_00
 That's just a long.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_00
 So, that's, sorry, that's all you.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, fine.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, that's it.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_03
 There we go.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, this is my important trend watching.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_03
 The digital is from Internet from Executive Summary for us on the top three things once it's back.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_03
 You can see my, I've got reports from a past plan on new fashions.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_03
 And the most important aspect is the look, it has to look fancy looking fuel.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_03
 Instead of the current functional looking fuel, this is, this is a twice as important as the second aspect, which is the 10, logically innovative side of it.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_03
 So, on the third being easy to use, it's probably a given before you have to try to incorporate.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_00
 So, well, I mean, I think that's what we're suggesting to address all three of those.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:07	None
 Nice.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, sorry.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and from the fashion watches from on, I have said, for vegetables are an important thing for clothes, furniture, shoes, etc.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_03
 So, clothes, shoes, furniture.

0:21:25	SPEAKER_03
 And a spongey material to be used on the outside.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure that's different, so, yeah.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_03
 But I was going to say, yeah, for vegetables, important to this year, important to furniture.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_03
 I just can't say, like, fashion, we're going for the, it looks fancy in fashion.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_03
 So, obviously, the way we're going to be going through it.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_03
 But, but, fashion don't last very long.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_04
 Well, that can kind of tie into our changing face things, like we could have vegetable themed this year.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_04
 Whatever happens next year, we can have the space.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_03
 A spongey skin on it.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_02
 And then we can just whip that off and...

0:22:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, like the kind you get on my canned wipes, you know, that kind of spongey.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, weird, I don't know what that is, but yeah.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_00
 Also, we need to drop it without damaging it.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's true.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we could, if we could save, depending on the cost of the product itself, you know, could we have a cheaper, a cheaper power source, and then just have it annually renewed?

0:22:31	SPEAKER_03
 Instead of having a ten year guarantee with interchangeable covers, we're going to buy a new one every year, a new one-wide new fashion's coming.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it's, it's an interesting idea.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_00
 It's like the old swatch watch, where only batteries have a lot changed in those, because people just bought a new one when it went to fashion.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_00
 It's just never been seen as a fashion item before.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so if they're made in sufficient quantity.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one, because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, we can... I mean, my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relative to little cost, you can make it last, you know, a long time.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_00
 But if you also make it cheap enough that people are there changing the cover every year or even buying new one every year, then it's even better.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_02
 What if we included the batteries in the cover?

0:23:33	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_04
 So, that also encourages them to buy new covers.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so can I see that?

0:23:41	SPEAKER_02
 And then just this is the example.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_00
 The immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that you then got the connection and you've immediately got a source of unreliability.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_00
 Whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that the whole thing is all completely soldered together.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I guess that's...

0:24:00	SPEAKER_00
 And it takes a reliability.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_00
 But I mean, I know what you're saying and understand where you're coming from.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_03
 But like more than just the battery, like a complete different, like you've only got like this bit to the bit you keep.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_03
 And this is expensive, but this is like the chip and this is the microphone.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_03
 And then this is the power source and the... but everyone sees.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_03
 And then...

0:24:25	SPEAKER_00
 I think if you're going to get it down that route, then we're talking about the cost slightly more than that.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_00
 Just building the whole thing in one.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you're putting cheap production costs.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_00
 And giving people the option of buying a new, a complete new thing.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_00
 The advantage of a replaceable cover is that anything that doesn't have a cover on at all, it will still work totally.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_00
 And people lose the cover.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many euros on a new one.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_00
 Rather than a complete new...

0:25:03	SPEAKER_04
 Well, that's just it with the covers, you're sort of tricking them into continuing to spend their money on our products without making them feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I mean, it's up to...

0:25:12	SPEAKER_00
 It's up to...

0:25:13	SPEAKER_00
 It's up to our marketing people to make turn it into a fashion item.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_00
 And as external fashions change, then we get new covers on the market and readily available.

0:25:26	SPEAKER_04
 And that's the sort of thing, once you get the mold set, you can just whip out different colors.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_02
 If they have a fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh fruit and animal print and colors.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry, you can't finish the door.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_03
 I don't watch that.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_03
 I was just going to say, yeah, we're going to make this part of the fashion supply to furniture, so we're going to make this part to furniture.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_00
 It's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominently displayed on their coffee table to say, this says something about me.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_00
 This is fashionable.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_00
 This is fashionable.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_00
 I'm with it.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_00
 I'm up to date.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_00
 The design that I've got, then it could be a homemade design.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_00
 This says this is not just a television remote control. This is a fashion accessory.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_00
 So, I mean, the basic shape is what we give them that we've got.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_00
 One on off button, presumably two buttons for channel change and one slider.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_00
 And basically nothing else.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_00
 We need to decide on the, just the basic shape of the thing.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_00
 Now, whether we go down the fruit and veg roots, and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_00
 That's what the organic curved look, the two deliberately get away from the square look of most currents, remotes.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_00
 Whether the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_00
 Because there's something in there, the corporate logo needs to be prominently displayed so that people look at it and say, right, that's a real reaction.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_00
 Remote control, I want one of those.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know that we should make the whole thing.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_04
 You'd have a yellow circle with the RR and it's on it.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yellow seems a bit of a strong color to make me feel like the thing, no, but we should like wipe the gray black or some sort of black color.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_00
 We're simply required to incorporate the corporate logo prominently.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_00
 Well, this is the whole point.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, I've got a real reaction remote control.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_00
 Here's my real reaction, copy maker or whatever.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_00
 And then people demand more real reaction stuff.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I was sort of picturing maybe a shape that's almost like a mouse.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_02
 When they hold it, because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand, maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_02
 But that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons, the power, wherever.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, now it's just an idea that I had.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_00
 Well, as I said, my idea was probably a bit fatter than this, but that sort of shape.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_04
 You want to narrow it a mouse, because a mouse you're kind of just resting on it.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_04
 You want something you can definitely grip.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_00
 It's sort of a combination.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_00
 The mouse but held.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_00
 So you sort of hold it, you hand like that.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_00
 Fiddle around it.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so yeah, maybe a little wider than this because this is pretty comfortable to hold.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe almost like a hairbrush, you'd get the width of that end of the hand and it widens up top.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_02
 And then it would have a wider thing to have the light, the infrared light at the TV and just kind of change channels and adjust the volume.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_02
 The power could be wherever up at the top or something.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_02
 Cool.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_02
 What do you guys think about that?

0:29:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so it's okay, yeah, I'm just suddenly realizing that, yeah, we're discussing how much how good it's going to be to change channels.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_03
 We still can just tell it to.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_03
 We're starting to get away from the voice functionality of it.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_02
 That's a very good point.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_00
 That is a very good point.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think we decided that we were actually going down both routes.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we need the manual controls and that they should be of that form.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_04
 Do you know this shape also kind of lends itself to voice-ness because if you're holding it and you're fiddling, which you can also bring it up like that and it's like a blessing.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, maybe we could, like we were leaving out the buttons for the forestry kind of used stuff.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_03
 We could incorporate that into the voice.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_00
 Honestly, my personal view is that if it's not there, people wouldn't use it anyway.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_00
 I suppose.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_03
 The areas for the off-chance, you know, the brightness is rough on your TV.

0:30:18	SPEAKER_03
 The contrast is changing.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_00
 It's certainly possible.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, but we're going beyond, given the state of the technology, we want something that we know will work.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_04
 We can still incorporate the voice with less buttons.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, if the power button was also somehow like a menu button, you could press that or do voice commands.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_04
 And the volume thing could also be to scroll through other options.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_04
 And you could scroll through brightness.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I suppose you can minimize the buttons and still have those, you know, brightness and tint and stuff.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, I'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_02
 We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_02
 So have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons on the volume.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, if we're going down that route, then we need some sort of display.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_00
 Do we need some sort of...

0:31:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's the turn.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that usually could probably be the menu.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_04
 And then hit menu and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_03
 And you use the scroll through it.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_03
 On to like a mouse, the scrolling button is actually a button as well. You could press it and press that.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, press that.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that might be where you saw that work though, but yeah.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's like the mouse where you just kind of click it. You just press it.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and you could just click that.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_02
 So if you had like the menu, then you could scroll through and then click it to select.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you know what I mean?

0:31:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, we've got five minutes to go in this meeting.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_00
 So I think we've actually very conveniently just come to a good point to sum up.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_00
 So the Kate and Kendra now go away and play with a bit of plasticine or play dough or whatever it is on the other side of the Atlantic.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_00
 And actually what we've discussed into something, I was going to say concrete.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_00
 That's a slightly inappropriate word to something that we can see.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_00
 And Andrew can go away and think about how we can actually market this as a concept.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_00
 So not just a simple remote control.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_03
 Can I just get some things clear as front of you?

0:32:48	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, of course.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_00
 Energy source is going to be long term.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_00
 I think we decided that we're going to, for simplicity of manufacturing and maintenance that we will go for a long term battery source.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_00
 On the basis that if you're going through making a fashion statement, then people are more likely to change it anyway before it runs out.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_00
 And making assumption that we can aim for a battery that will last most people for, I'll say at least five, ten years, and that we will guarantee it for five years.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_00
 And we're having a custom chip.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_00
 We're having a custom chip, but given we've cut the functions down, that will hopefully not be too problematic.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_00
 But given the technological innovation is important, then we need to say it again technologically innovate.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_00
 And we must resist any efforts to try and water that down.

0:34:04	SPEAKER_03
 And in the tangible case.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_00
 Interchangeable case seems to be important to the concept.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_00
 It should be cheap if we avoid any electrical connections.

0:34:22	SPEAKER_00
 If we can come up with some way of allowing people to actually personalize it to whatever they want, then this is totally new.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_00
 We don't know whether to what extent people do it or not, but if they've at least got a good selection of covers that they can use anyway.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_00
 And if we can keep them rolling, then get them in the supermarket when they go down to any of the famous supermarkets I wouldn't mention any names.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_00
 It's good for the supermarket, it's good for those, and it hopefully makes them feel better.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_03
 And are we going to have it being illuminated from inside onto the button?

0:35:10	SPEAKER_00
 No, because we've got to say a few buttons that it actually makes that redundant.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and especially if we're making them so different to feel.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_00
 And that solves one of the problems of battery life, because that would pop up the battery life.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, given the nature of the buttons we're having, it's actually unnecessary, I think.

0:35:32	SPEAKER_03
 Are we having it at any angle?

0:35:36	SPEAKER_00
 Or is it just as wide?

0:35:39	SPEAKER_00
 Certainly wider angle than current, so that if you're holding it anyway, like your 92.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_00
 And it will work most of the time.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_00
 Not like my mum who points it at the ceiling and why the television doesn't work.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, I sort of had visage that if this was the thing, then sort of the hold of the top would be the infrared score.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, the reality is people are they're going to be looking at the television whilst they're using it, the chances are.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_00
 So, it's all clear where we go from here.

0:36:48	None
 So,
