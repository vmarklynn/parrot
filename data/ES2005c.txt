0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 Every time I do something I forget.

0:00:05	SPEAKER_05
 Right time attached, I'm here.

0:00:21	SPEAKER_03
 Here?

0:00:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:00:23	None
 Excuse me.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_05
 We are, so the meeting will have the same format as the last time, so same as much.

0:00:38	SPEAKER_05
 Switching over up just left and went first to screens.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_05
 I have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time.

0:00:50	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, cool.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_05
 And, is there any questions you have for the rise from last meeting?

0:01:01	SPEAKER_05
 Particularly bothering you.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_01
 No, I don't think so.

0:01:05	SPEAKER_01
 No, okay, cool.

0:01:07	SPEAKER_05
 Then we shall start with a presentation from that.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_00
 Hi, Mirage again.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_00
 In this meeting, I'm going to discuss about the trend watching.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_00
 How this trend is going to affect our market potential and how important is this?

0:01:29	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to look on this.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_00
 First of all, methodology.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_00
 The methodology to find out the trend was done in a way.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_00
 We have done a recent, not only recent remote control market survey, but we also considered the latest fashion trends of the market.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_00
 Because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_00
 So what are our findings?

0:01:57	SPEAKER_00
 In our findings, we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey, we found that people do have preference for the fancy remote controls, which look and feel very good rather than having a functional look and feel good.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_00
 So this clearly indicates their preference for the design, their outlook of their remote controls.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_00
 So we should consider this factor as the most important factor.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_00
 Because this factor is twice as important, the second factor, which is further as important as the third factor.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_00
 So this factor becomes the most important factor in our mark.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_00
 Means in designing our remote controls?

0:02:49	SPEAKER_01
 The last one is the most important one.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_00
 No, the first one is the outlook of the mobile.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_00
 It should have a fancy outlook, a fancy design.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_00
 Rather than just having a functional look and feel good, it should have a fancy look and feel good.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_00
 The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically innovative.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_00
 We must have some technological advancement in the remote control rather than just putting it as it is as the other remote controls are.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_00
 So it should be technologically innovative, like glow in the dark or speech recognition, something like that.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_00
 So that indicates our technological advancement.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_00
 And the third most important aspect to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_00
 Like it should have been too much complicated.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_00
 There shouldn't be too many buttons on this remote control.

0:03:47	SPEAKER_00
 It should have been too complicated like this way.

0:03:51	SPEAKER_00
 And customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language, something so that they could know how to use this remote control.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_00
 When we did a recent fashion update shows that our recent fashion update shows that

0:04:13	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if it's very infestible. How to know how again to incorporate that?

0:04:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we have to.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_00
 Because you can see how people have related their close shoes and furniture, everything with fruits and vegetables.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_00
 The world is now changing its strength to our organic, becoming more and more organic, becoming a big sponge.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_00
 So that's very good.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_00
 So something like that we should do.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_00
 And people, the feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look hard look.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_00
 Well that's good.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_00
 That's what I was thinking.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_00
 So that they could play with it while handling it.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_00
 So that should also be taken into consideration.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_00
 So these are my views.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, this spongey, not real spongey.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_01
 You can think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be good?

0:05:15	SPEAKER_00
 The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_00
 That's very flexible.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_00
 It shouldn't be any harm to the environment also because our company is very, very good for taking all these concerns into consideration.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_00
 So we don't want to have any harm to the society.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_00
 So.

0:05:37	None
 Cool.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_00
 So that's all.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_05
 Good image.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_05
 I go.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_05
 That's why I think of when I think of that.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_05
 I remember it.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sure you're controlling.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:05:50	SPEAKER_03
 Next year, you're in the...

0:05:55	SPEAKER_01
 And whether any factors that weren't important in the survey that they said we don't want.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_00
 We didn't find out any such points.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, there could be, but we couldn't find out any.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_00
 Cool.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_01
 What is it?

0:06:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_00
 You're 30s, too.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_00
 Oh no.

0:06:30	None
 You signal.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_02
 Is that Ande?

0:06:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_01
 And then F5, right?

0:06:47	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_01
 So the interface concept.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_01
 The interface specification.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_01
 What people, how they interact with it, basically, I think.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_01
 So the method we looked at existing designs.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_01
 One of the words good about them.

0:07:10	SPEAKER_01
 What's bad about them.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_01
 And looked at their flaws.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to look at their flaws and everything.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_01
 And what the survey told us and what we think would be good.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_01
 So a bit of imagination.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_01
 The findings.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_01
 I've got some pictures to show you.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_01
 So most remote control is these graphical interface where you have got buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a stream of text or something.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_01
 And also found that there's inconsistent layout which makes it confusing.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_01
 So I think there are remote control.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_01
 There is some inconsistency already existing in between remote controls, but I think the standard kind of shape and play.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_01
 And those kind of buttons like the top right for on and off.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_01
 Something I think you find that important because then it's easy to use.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_01
 And we've got some pictures of some newer remote controls to show you.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm going to press Escape F5.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_05
 And just to escape.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_01
 Escape.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I see.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_01
 I've got a class here as well.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_01
 So these are the some of the pictures of existing ones.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_01
 I'll just talk you through them.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_01
 This one is Voice Recognition.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_01
 And that's the kind of idea we're going for.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_01
 And it's an LCD thing which we thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_01
 This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse which.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_01
 Right in the middle button.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_01
 But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_05
 Like, would the computer come out?

0:09:01	SPEAKER_05
 If I'm thinking of the right one, I've got the same thing in front of my monitor.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_05
 You scroll it and then when you reach the sort of.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_05
 Manure it and let you require your press.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_05
 That's like the LCD one.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_01
 But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_01
 But I presume that the functions must come up on the TV screen.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's what that is.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_01
 So these are just a few I did.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 Again, that's just quite boring shape.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_01
 Gray looks quite space-adjee but too many buttons I think.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_01
 And that one looks like something else.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it does look kind of dangerous.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_01
 This one I thought was really cool.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_01
 It's got the programability function that we talked about.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_01
 You can put it in there.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_01
 It's for your kids and it's quite an organic shape.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_01
 And the little circle around there is pretty cool.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_01
 And that's really easy to use, bright.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_01
 So I like this one a lot for our design.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_01
 I think something like that would be good.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_01
 Of course, yeah.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_05
 I mean the one thing I think about these ones is.

0:09:59	SPEAKER_05
 They're secured areas.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_05
 I've seen a lot of them with the cover of the missing.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_05
 So I can have a head and show them.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's true.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the TV or something.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_01
 And this one, the oversized one.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know about you but I think it's a bit too gimmicky.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think that will sell.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_05
 Is that not sort of to assist the blinders or things?

0:10:29	SPEAKER_01
 I guess so.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's a bit...

0:10:33	SPEAKER_04
 Why don't watch TV?

0:10:35	SPEAKER_01
 Exactly.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_01
 It wasn't too.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_01
 And this one is just pointing out.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_01
 I like some of these things.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_01
 The raised symbols and everything but it's pointing out that this one, the volume, it's kind of pressing down but it would actually go up because of the shape.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_01
 So that's a bit confusing.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_01
 But the buttons on this I think are just showing you how you can have different buttons and it ought to be all the same.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_01
 So that's quite cool.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_05
 For people to recognize certain shapes to do certain things.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, exactly.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_01
 So there is some of the findings.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_01
 So we need to combine those ones.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_01
 And I've just got an email from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it is.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_01
 Just in time.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_01
 Very handy.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_01
 So I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_01
 You program it like you say record and then play and then record play machine and stuff like that.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_01
 So that's and it's much.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_01
 So that's quite cool.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_01
 Person preferences just some imagination.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_01
 The raised symbols I feel good.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_01
 The LCD.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_01
 It does look smart but I think maybe for our budget, do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the LCD?

0:12:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_04
 And the other stuff.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_04
 And the speech recognition.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_01
 I think we definitely got into speech recognition.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_00
 But in our market survey, we have seen that people are willing to pay more.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_00
 But they want the quality.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_00
 They want fancy.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_00
 Look, they want some new design, something new.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_00
 Uh-huh.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_00
 Not budget.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_00
 So even if we increase our course a little bit within some limits.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_00
 And we give something new, technological advance, as well as new design with fancy outlook.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_00
 And we will be able to have a good sales in the market.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not sure.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_01
 But if 25 year raised 12 year old 50 manufacturing costs, the thing that might.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_05
 I can't say.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_05
 Although I mean, three, sure they have got, I mean, they are going crazy with the LCD technology now.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_05
 So that you've got your LCD TV to the rhythm.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_05
 So maybe the small one.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, like, I have the black and white, I guess it just doesn't look funky enough.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_05
 But I mean, like even mobile phones or whatever, I have color LCD screens.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, I would know about the cost of it.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_02
 Uh-huh.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_04
 But I'm not understanding.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_04
 Is it too complicated?

0:13:26	SPEAKER_04
 Is it going to be too much just overload?

0:13:28	SPEAKER_04
 Uh-huh.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's the thing.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_00
 It will be easy because there will be on LCD screen.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_00
 There will be different, different icons.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_00
 They can just click, okay, whatever they want.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_04
 And you can use remote control, you never look at it, right?

0:13:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, you're looking at TV.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's true.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_04
 And it just seems kind of like a...

0:13:47	SPEAKER_01
 And one of the survey findings was that they wanted easy to use.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_01
 So I think I'm not sure about the LCD.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_01
 It's a great, it's a good idea, but for a budget and for the thing we're trying to go for, easy to use, it's not the thing we should go for, I think.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_01
 Child friends, I thought this was good.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_01
 As you pointed out there, the bit often goes missing.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_01
 Especially with children.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_01
 But it's a good shape and the organic is kind of, we could make a vegetable-y kind of round shape, I think.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_01
 So which version?

0:14:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I know carrot.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_05
 So since we're going for the company colors, I think your lemon wasn't that bad.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_05
 And if it doesn't work, you know?

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 But we don't want it to be...

0:14:27	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_01
 The child friendly, yeah.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_01
 Easy to use, it seems quite easy.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_01
 She's like the different shapes of the buttons and stuff.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's a good idea to go for.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_01
 The light and colorful buttons as well.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_01
 And the mouse one, I thought it was a good idea because people use my, my mouse is now with this scrolling thing.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, we are a marketing to sort of, 35 to 35, so most people will have come in contact with us.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_01
 And use.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_01
 So they'd be able to use that.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_01
 As I said, I think I'd presume it would come up on the screen.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_01
 So there you go.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_05
 That means you get to bump that bit to the TV, it goes.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_01
 So that's the user interface.

0:15:10	None
 It's live.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_01
 Take this out now then.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_04
 So I guess there are a lot of options that we're going to have to choose from among.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_04
 And I'll give you the technical considerations for those.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_04
 I don't want to use a whiteboard just because we haven't used it.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_05
 I was just thinking of the self.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_04
 So the one thing to do this is we're going to take a look at some old and no controls.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_04
 See how they work.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_04
 We use the final kind of essential pieces of it.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_04
 And then we'll throw in our new innovations and keep it all in budget.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_04
 So looking inside a very simple and not control.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_04
 This is what they sent me.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_04
 Here's the competition I suppose.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_04
 You open it up.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_04
 There's a circuit board inside.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_04
 And there's a chip password, the TA-1835, which receives input from the buttons.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_05
 This is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip, because it's very cheap.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_04
 And my disk remote costs nothing.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_04
 So that takes the signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it sends to the amplifier, which is made of some transistors and amplifiers, up amps.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_04
 And then that gets sent to the LED light, which I can see is a red light bulb.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_04
 And that sends out the infrared light signal to the television.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_04
 So this is kind of the bare essentials that we need to have in our remote control.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_05
 So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum amount?

0:17:27	SPEAKER_04
 No, I mean this is very old ones.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_04
 So now the new technology is going to be a minimum of small and keep almost a key thing.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_04
 Right. So this is what we need to have for certain.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_04
 So as I said, we got the outer casing, the tripped side.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_04
 You know, it's going to be the board we have to use this, the same setup.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_04
 Processor, we'll probably use a more advanced processor than I had.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_04
 Amplifier and transmitter are all standard.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_04
 So for the casing, this email I got from our manufacturing team, you know, we have a bunch of options from wood, titanium, rubber, plastic, but not latex, dull curve.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_04
 So lots of choices.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_04
 What do you think?

0:18:19	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I mean latex has a kind of spongy feel to it, doesn't it?

0:18:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's very last-digit for sure.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_05
 And that would also give it kind of durability.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_05
 And it's also relatively cheap to cast.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_05
 So I'm going to base a sort of initial plastic with a latex kind of sheath.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so I hear a plastic latex.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_01
 I like the rubber, the stress balls, I think, you know, that could be a bit of a gimmick.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_01
 It's good to hold.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_04
 So something would give to it?

0:18:59	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_01
 And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_01
 The color is yellow, right?

0:19:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_01
 Or at least incorporate it.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yellow incorporated, yeah.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, if we're going to work, so, I don't know, other...

0:19:15	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's standard silver kind of other parts, or...

0:19:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the buttons, like, because there's going to be the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons and probably two different colors.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_01
 Or if we're having buttons, actually.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_04
 So yellow, everybody.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_04
 And then what color for the buttons?

0:19:38	SPEAKER_05
 I quite like the multi-colored buttons, you say?

0:19:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_04
 So multi-colored buttons.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_01
 You do have ones like playing, could be green or on and off, is red and stuff like that, yeah?

0:19:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, or yeah, maybe it's the moment of color.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_05
 So it doesn't look too childish.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's true, because that blue one did look quite childish.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_05
 Although I mean, this also comes to shape as well.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, if we are going to make it a double...

0:20:04	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, double curve signs, good to me, if we're talking about it, so we're arguing all the things that are easy to use.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_05
 It'll be come for you, you know?

0:20:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_04
 So the shape, what we want to go...

0:20:17	SPEAKER_04
 How exactly, maybe?

0:20:19	SPEAKER_01
 Like an hourglass kind of figure, is that what you're thinking of?

0:20:23	SPEAKER_01
 Or just like it?

0:20:25	SPEAKER_05
 That's sort of comfortable to hold, easy to hold, so you don't drop it.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_05
 What about a banana?

0:20:31	SPEAKER_01
 We could make novelty remote controls.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_01
 Well, yeah, I mean, like...

0:20:35	SPEAKER_04
 If we could have a big banana shape, remote control.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_04
 Because yellow.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, yeah.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_03
 And a lemon might be a little bit...

0:20:43	SPEAKER_03
 But then how would you point it?

0:20:44	SPEAKER_01
 How would you point it?

0:20:47	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't matter which other point it is.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_04
 You could have a little LED in the chat.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_04
 Where would we call it?

0:20:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I appreciate this idea, because then this...

0:20:57	SPEAKER_00
 This will help us in our advertisement also, and we can relate it with fruits and vegetables, the people's choices, that whatever data shows that.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_00
 So this...

0:21:08	SPEAKER_01
 What are you...

0:21:10	SPEAKER_01
 Are you a bad banana idea?

0:21:12	SPEAKER_05
 It's a spongy...

0:21:14	SPEAKER_05
 Rubber banana.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_01
 I mean...

0:21:18	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_05
 It does seem a bit...

0:21:21	SPEAKER_05
 Again, childish, maybe.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_01
 I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetables shape.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_01
 What else did you say about fashions that was...

0:21:32	SPEAKER_00
 The fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables, like people...

0:21:37	SPEAKER_00
 And spongy.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_04
 And then a file...

0:21:40	SPEAKER_04
 So it would have a stem perhaps?

0:21:43	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_01
 It would be a sum.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_01
 Like what...

0:21:48	SPEAKER_01
 What's that?

0:21:49	SPEAKER_01
 I don't even know the name of it.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_01
 It looks like a little snowman kind of thing.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know the name of that.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_04
 So it looks like this kind of...

0:21:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_01
 Like a gourd?

0:22:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, maybe that's a bit...

0:22:03	SPEAKER_01
 Because you can hold it in the bottom bit.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_04
 And it has a clear top and bottom.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_04
 So you can say, you know, transits from the sand.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, why the hell not?

0:22:13	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_01
 What do you think?

0:22:15	SPEAKER_01
 What do you think?

0:22:16	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I guess it's kind of...

0:22:19	SPEAKER_05
 You don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_05
 Just have that kind of fruitish shape.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_00
 Then only we get a little...

0:22:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, something...

0:22:31	SPEAKER_00
 Related by advertising.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_04
 Exactly.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_04
 So double curved, single curved...

0:22:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_00
 Or we can do something, we can design two, three shapes.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_00
 And we can have a public survey.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_00
 Let the public choose what they want.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_05
 That's a good idea.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_04
 I guess, since you're the marketing guy...

0:22:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, sure.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_00
 I will be happy to do that.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_01
 What do you do?

0:22:56	SPEAKER_01
 Unbussings, what did we say?

0:22:58	SPEAKER_01
 Different shapes?

0:22:59	SPEAKER_01
 What buttons?

0:23:01	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, for the specific functions, you know, up and down.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_05
 Play, stop.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_05
 You've got, I mean, you've got standard sort of intuitive things that are always used.

0:23:16	None
 Under...

0:23:17	SPEAKER_01
 It has like that.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_03
 Let's go.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_03
 I like it.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_05
 With a scroll wheel or no?

0:23:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, with a scroll wheel.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_01
 Speed track ignition.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_05
 Speed track ignition, I think.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_05
 So we need a microphone, presumably.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_05
 I could put the microphone here.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_04
 It has a microphone.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_05
 Where should I put it?

0:23:42	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use?

0:23:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'm not sure.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, those ideas I saw were just for inspiration, I think.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_01
 I do not know.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I can...

0:23:56	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_04
 I couldn't do some user tests with scroll wheel.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_05
 And I think if this new software for the same recognition is that you keep keeping the microphone.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_04
 So should the microphone be just anywhere on it?

0:24:10	SPEAKER_05
 I would put it sort of sub-centrally, so it's...

0:24:14	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_05
 So it can be sort of held on.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_05
 We're really going to need to hold it if it's going to be a voice recognition.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we can...

0:24:36	SPEAKER_01
 So let's not use the whiteboard anymore.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_04
 I'm just lazy.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_01
 And so what else was the...

0:24:59	SPEAKER_01
 What about the glow in the dark thing, the strip around it?

0:25:02	SPEAKER_05
 We're just going to need that.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_05
 I still like it.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_01
 I like it.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_01
 But that's me.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_01
 Because we've got the technological innovation with speech recognition.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, some of it is just going about too far.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, we are pushing it probably.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_05
 Because it's fun to flip.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we're getting yellow.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_01
 What do you know?

0:25:21	SPEAKER_05
 Because I mean, like, I mean, how good is this speech recognition thing?

0:25:25	SPEAKER_05
 Do we want to go for buttons at all that we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ball?

0:25:33	SPEAKER_01
 Do you put it in the fruit bowl?

0:25:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_01
 You know, and then you just talk from...

0:25:36	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, everybody's got fruit ball in front of the tail.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_04
 And then you can even encourage healthier habits for television watching.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_04
 Make them think of fruit.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_04
 Just make sure they don't eat their amount.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_05
 I mean...

0:25:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, doing that.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, I like to think of a fruit that could sit.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_05
 So then the pen lay on its own like an apple.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_05
 It's just apples.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_05
 So, yeah, the apples, that's...

0:26:05	SPEAKER_01
 I quite like the design of that.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_01
 Because that could sit on its own.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_01
 It's quite a study base.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_01
 Ruby.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_01
 And as we say, we don't want to be too ridiculous with the fruit things.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, about the speech thing, it doesn't have to be handheld, of course, making a steady distance.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_05
 So, I mean, like, you could actually...

0:26:31	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, you should be careful.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_00
 Or we can do one thing.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_00
 We can just have a remote control.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_00
 And k-things of different different shapes, different fruit shapes.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_00
 In such a way that any k-thing could be fit into this mobile general piece.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_00
 So, whatever people want, like if somebody wants it in a banana shape, we will put that casing onto that mobile phone.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_00
 So, it will look...

0:26:54	SPEAKER_00
 It will look...

0:26:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_00
 You said about disposable things.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_01
 You said about disposable, early people want disposable things.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:27:04	SPEAKER_00
 Like, if this is a mobile phone, we will design k-thing in such a way, Like, half of...

0:27:11	SPEAKER_00
 We need not to have a full cover.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_00
 We will just have a half of cover, okay?

0:27:16	SPEAKER_00
 If somebody wants it in banana shape, we will fit banana shape k-thing onto that.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_00
 So, it will give a banana shape look.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_00
 If somebody wants it in apple shape, we will design that.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_00
 We will put apple shape casing on that.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_00
 It will give apple shape look.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_00
 So, in that way, you can have any...

0:27:33	SPEAKER_00
 Means, whatever you want.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_01
 Without...

0:27:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, button will be on the upper side.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, there's something.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_00
 Buttons will be on the upper side.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_00
 That's the other side.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_00
 Buttons will be on the upper side.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_00
 Lower side, we will just put the casing.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_00
 So, half of that will be...

0:27:48	SPEAKER_00
 Half of the frame.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_00
 Not the upper side.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_00
 So, from lower, you can...

0:27:52	SPEAKER_00
 Means, while you are holding from this side, you can have banana look or apple look, whatever.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_00
 So, in that way, we need not to have different, different shape, mobiles, everything.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_00
 We will just design k-thing through shape.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_05
 So, if you think if you are going to have a fascia, then you want to have it so that it does go for the buttons.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_05
 Because I mean, if you think about it, if they are wanting it, because they want to look at it, if they are using it, and what they want to look at is facing away from them, it doesn't really...

0:28:22	SPEAKER_05
 You know, because that will be in the palm of the hand, we will be able to see.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_05
 Unless you have serve, you got the buttons option on one side, you get the fascia on the other side with the microphone so that you can place it face down, and you have got the fascia, and you can just talk at them.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_05
 Maybe.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_04
 So...

0:28:45	SPEAKER_05
 So, you have narrowed it down to half of those options?

0:28:50	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_04
 So, I guess we decide on material, right?

0:28:53	SPEAKER_04
 So, that's spongy, latex rubber, everything.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_04
 And the color is, we got down.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I'm not sure if we should go so far on the whole fruit thing, because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_01
 We're stuck with what we've got there.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_01
 I think we're trying to get to 25-35 years, want it quite trendy as well, they said, they wanted something that looks fancy, and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a... too much of a gimmick, but something ergonomically shaped and organic, like good to hold based on fruits and natural things like that.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_01
 Because already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow, you know?

0:29:40	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, we could make it a nice pale yellow.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_05
 Well, it's kind of got a VR company, you know?

0:29:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_05
 So, again, I mean, like we could have, I mean, we could quite easily have the main body be a different.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with you said, the slogan, the slogan.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_05
 And then going round, yeah.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_05
 Because, I mean, not necessarily that the whole body has to be of the company colour.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_05
 You know, blue and yellow tend to go to our well together, so you have the main body blue with the yellow, and the logo and slogan running up one side of it.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_04
 Uh-huh.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_04
 That's for the energy source.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_04
 You know, almost every, you know, choice just batteries, but we don't have to be limited by that.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_04
 We can use a hand dynamo.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's basically the more you move it, it's got everything inside that just kind of powers it.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_04
 Or a dynamo.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_01
 Like with those watches that you can twist, yeah.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_04
 So it's quite cool.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_04
 You should keep the actual reaction anyways.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_04
 But, yeah.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_00
 But do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo?

0:31:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_00
 These type of cells, because then people have to, like, if this head is out, that's a bit.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_00
 A bit of accommodation to.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_05
 Especially if they want to use it specifically as voice activated.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_01
 Most of the people.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_01
 And they have to pick it up and then activate it and then, yeah.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_05
 That's true.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_04
 What are the other options?

0:31:23	SPEAKER_04
 Uh, there's solar power.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_00
 Uh, solar power will also not be a good idea, because then they have to keep their mobile's outside.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_00
 And solar energy and the days when there is no solar sunlight.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_00
 I'm with Raj on that.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_00
 I've got, I've got not facing how it's the sun.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_00
 I think we should rechargeable.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_00
 Battery will be a good idea.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_00
 They can recharge it.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, I've got an idea that I thought, um, just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of body.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_05
 And we're very, very environmentally friendly company.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_05
 Having a rechargeable stand so that not only it does also stand, but, um, for using it as a recharging it, for using it as a zone recognition.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_01
 Like a hand, like one of those portable fans.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, exactly.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_04
 So, uh, a rechargeable battery.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_04
 Um, the user faced the buttons.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_04
 I guess we talked about this, right?

0:32:23	SPEAKER_05
 We watched Chip on print.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_05
 What's, hmm?

0:32:26	SPEAKER_05
 Sorry.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_05
 Never mind.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_04
 The electronics, um, basically the more features we add.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_04
 Um, so the more features we add, the answer chips we need to buy, and put in, which adds to the cost, as we expect.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_04
 Um, but, uh, I think we can keep it all on the budget.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_04
 So, uh, yeah.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_04
 So the speech thing you said, our, our technology, our research and development department came up with some breakthrough.

0:33:00	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_05
 So, yeah.

0:33:03	SPEAKER_05
 We're just having buttons on the speech then, and we're getting our cheapest option of chirping.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_05
 That's good.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, okay.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_05
 We're kind of, uh, we're kind of, um, I've just deleted that whole thing.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_05
 Um, we're kind of running out time.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_05
 So, if you could, um, uh, was that you, um, that means you're a bit discovered.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, yeah.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_05
 Just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to see next.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_05
 Excuse me?

0:33:40	SPEAKER_04
 Um, yeah.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_04
 So, yeah, I'm sure I think.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, mine seems to turn off.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_01
 I can't do anything.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_00
 I just touched the path.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_00
 You just touched the path.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_05
 No, it's actually shut down.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_01
 It's on, but there's nothing to do.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_05
 Um, no, what we have, uh, our next meeting is in half an hour.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_05
 And what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in Cle.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, I guess they do it too.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_05
 So, um, you know, I mean, luckily we chose a nice simple shape.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_05
 Um, and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_04
 Hey, that's great.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_04
 Save everything to the shared documents.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah.

0:34:28	SPEAKER_05
 I hope I can recover this because of that.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_05
 So, we deleted it.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_05
 Which doesn't really help you much.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_01
 I think I'd save mine already.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, can you save that?

0:34:38	SPEAKER_05
 I send that last one again.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_05
 Please, Raj.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_05
 I still can't find it on there.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_00
 It was under different name.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_00
 I will show you.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_00
 In shared documents.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_00
 Uh, working components.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, you didn't get that.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_00
 I will send it.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_00

0:35:04	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry, I put it in the shared documents.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_05
 That's actually that.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_05
 It goes there automatically.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_05
 If you put in project documents, project documents is on the, um, desktop.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_00
 I can't open it.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_00
 But I can't open that because it asks for some user name or password.

0:35:23	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:35:24	SPEAKER_04
 I'll show you.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_05
 I think, um, hold on.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_05
