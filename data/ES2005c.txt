0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 Every time we do something we get home.

0:00:04	SPEAKER_05
 Alright, I'm attached, I'm here.

0:00:21	SPEAKER_03
 Here?

0:00:22	SPEAKER_03
 Here.

0:00:23	None
 Excuse me.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_05
 We are, the meeting will have about the same format as the last time, so I'm switching over up just left and left first two screens out.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_05
 I have mailed to you the minutes of the last meeting, just to save time.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, cool.

0:00:53	SPEAKER_05
 And, is there any questions you have for the right from last meeting, particularly bothering you?

0:01:02	SPEAKER_01
 No, I don't think so.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, cool.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_05
 Then we shall start with a presentation from that.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_00
 I've made a joke again.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_00
 In this meeting, I'm going to discuss about the trend watching.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_00
 How this trend is going to affect our market potential and how important is this.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to look on this.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_00
 First of all, methodology.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_00
 The methodology to find out the trend was done in a way.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_00
 We have done a not only recent remote control market survey, but we also considered the latest fashion trends of the market, because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_00
 So, what are our findings?

0:01:57	SPEAKER_00
 In our findings, we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey, we found that people do have preference for fancy remote controls, which look and feel very good.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_00
 Rather than having a functional look and feel good.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_00
 So, this clearly indicates their preference for the design, their outlook of the remote controls.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_00
 So, we should consider this factor as the most important factor, because this factor is twice as important the second factor, which is further twice as important as the third factor.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_00
 So, this factor becomes the most important factor in our mark, means in designing our remote controls.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_01
 The last one is the most important one.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_00
 No, the first one is the outlook of the mobile.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_00
 It should have a fancy outlook.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_00
 It is a fancy design.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_00
 Rather than just having a functional look and feel good, it should have a fancy look and feel good.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_00
 The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically innovative.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_00
 We must have some technological advancement in the remote controls rather than just putting it as it is as the other remote controls are.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_00
 So, it should be technologically innovative, like glow in the dark or speech recognition, something like that.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_00
 So, that indicates our technological advancement.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_00
 And the third most important aspect in this take into consideration is that it should be easy to use.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_00
 Like, it shouldn't be too much complicated.

0:03:43	SPEAKER_00
 There shouldn't be too many buttons on this remote control.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_00
 It shouldn't be too complicated like this way.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_00
 And customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language, something, so that they could know how to use these remote controls.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_00
 When we did fashion, our recent fashion update shows that...

0:04:12	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_01
 We're in vegetables.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_01
 How do you know how we're going to incorporate that?

0:04:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we have to, because you can see how people have related their clothes, shoes and furniture, everything with fruits and vegetables.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_00
 So, the world is now changing its strength to our organic, becoming more and more organic.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to make a big sponge running.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_00
 That's very good.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_00
 So, something like that we should do.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_00
 And people, the feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look, hard look.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that's good.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_00
 That's only kind of...

0:04:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_00
 So, that they could play with it while handling it.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_00
 So, that should also be taken into consideration.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_00
 So, these are my views.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_01
 The spongey, not real spongey.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_01
 You can think like rubber would be good.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_01
 Does it really want to be?

0:05:15	SPEAKER_00
 The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_00
 That we can take into account.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_00
 It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also because our company is very well adapted for taking all these concerns into consideration.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_00
 So, we don't want to have any harm to the society.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:05:35	SPEAKER_00
 Cool.

0:05:36	None
 That's all.

0:05:37	None
 Pretty much.

0:05:38	None
 There you go.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_00
 Just why I think of when I think of...

0:05:43	SPEAKER_05
 I remember control.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:05:45	SPEAKER_05
 Next slide.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_01
 Are there any factors that weren't important in the survey that they said we don't want to?

0:06:01	SPEAKER_00
 We didn't find out any such word.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, there could be, but we couldn't find out any.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_00
 Cool.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_01
 What is it?

0:06:18	SPEAKER_01
 Functionality.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:06:21	None
 Okay.

0:06:22	None
 Yeah.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_00
 You're so enthusiastic.

0:06:30	None
 No.

0:06:31	None
 You're sick.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_04
 Is that undo?

0:06:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_04
 Is that sifting?

0:06:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_01
 And then F5, right?

0:06:48	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_01
 So, the interface concept.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_01
 The interface specification.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_01
 What people, how they interact with it, basically, I think.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_01
 So, the method we looked at existing designs, what's good about them, what's bad about them, and looked at their flaws, we're going to look at their flaws and everything.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_01
 And what the survey told us and what we think would be good.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_01
 So, a bit of imagination.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_01
 The findings.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_01
 I've got some pictures to show you.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_01
 That's the rocket.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_01
 So, most remote controls use graphical interface where you have got buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a stream of text or something.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_01
 And we're also found that there's inconsistent layout which makes it confusing.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_01
 So, I think there are remote control.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_01
 There is some inconsistency already in existing between remote controls, but I think the standard kind of shape and play and those kind of buttons like the top right for on and off or something.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_01
 I think people find that important because it's easy to use.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_01
 And we've got some pictures of some new remote controls to show you.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_01
 Do I press escape F5?

0:08:14	SPEAKER_05
 And I'll just escape.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_01
 Escape, okay.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I still haven't got the glasses on.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_01
 So, these are some of the pictures of existing ones.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_01
 I'll just talk you through them.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_01
 This one is voice recognition.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_01
 And that's the kind of idea we're going for.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_01
 There's an LCD thing which we thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_01
 This one has a kind of scroll like a mouse.

0:08:52	SPEAKER_01
 Middle button.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_01
 But I'm not actually sure how you'd use that.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_05
 It's kind of like scroll.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_05
 If I'm thinking of the right one, I've got the same thing in front of my monitor.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_05
 You scroll it and then when you reach the sort of menu item that you're acquiring, press.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_01
 It's like the LCD one, is it?

0:09:17	SPEAKER_01
 But the one below that has got a little scroll function on the side, but I presume that the functions must come up on the TV screen.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's what that is.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_01
 So, these are just a few ideas.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 Again, that's just quite boring shape, grey.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_01
 It looks quite space-agey, but too many buttons, I think.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_01
 And that one's the right thing.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_01
 Looks like something else.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it does look kind of dangerous.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_01
 This one I thought was really cool. It's got the program and ability function that we talked about.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_01
 You can put it in there. It's a few kids and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_01
 And that's really easy to use, bright.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_01
 So, I like this one a lot for our design.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_01
 I think something like that would be good.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_01
 Of course, yeah.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, the one thing I think about it, but these ones is these secured areas.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_05
 I've seen a lot of them with the cover of missing.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_05
 Right, yeah.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_01
 So, like, have a head and shoulders.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_01
 So, maybe that could be built into one of the things when it comes up on the TV or something.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_01
 And this one, the oversized one.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know about you, but I think it's a bit too gimmicky.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think that will sound very well.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, is that not sort of just the blind or something, is it?

0:10:29	SPEAKER_01
 I guess so. I don't know.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_04
 I think that's a bit...

0:10:34	SPEAKER_04
 Blind or watch TV.

0:10:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, exactly.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_01
 And this one is just pointing out...

0:10:43	SPEAKER_01
 I like some of these things, the raised symbols and everything, but it's pointing out that this one, the volume, it's kind of pressing down, but it would actually go up because of the shape.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_01
 So, that's a bit confusing.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_01
 But the buttons on this, I think, are... it's just showing you how you can have different...

0:11:04	SPEAKER_01
 different buttons. I don't have to be all the same.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_01
 So, that's quite cool.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_05
 People tend to recognize certain shapes to do certain things.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, exactly.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_01
 F5.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_01
 So, there is some of the findings.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_01
 So, we need to combine those ones.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_01
 And I've just got an email from our technical department.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_01
 Saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it is. Just entirely, very handy.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_01
 So, I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_01
 You program it, like you say, record, and then play, and then record the same machine and stuff like that.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_01
 So, that's... and it's much...

0:11:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_01
 So, that's quite cool.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_01
 Personal preferences, just an imagination.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_01
 The raised symbols, I thought, were good.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_01
 The LCD.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_01
 It does look smart, but I think maybe for our budget, do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the...

0:12:09	SPEAKER_01
 The LCD.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_04
 And the other stuff, I think.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_01
 And the speech recognition.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_01
 Because I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_00
 But in our market survey, we have seen that people are willing to pay more.

0:12:22	SPEAKER_00
 But they want the quality.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_00
 They want fancy look.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_00
 They want some new design, something new.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_00
 A lot budget.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_00
 So, even if we increase our costs a little bit within some limits, and we give something new, technological advancement, as well as new design with fancy outlook, I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure if it's a 25-year raised...

0:12:51	SPEAKER_01
 12 euros 50 manufacturing costs, the thing that might...

0:12:55	SPEAKER_05
 I can't see.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_05
 Although, I mean, three...

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 The LCD.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_05
 Sure, they have got...

0:12:59	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, they are going crazy with the LCD technology now, so that you've got your LCD TVs and everything.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_05
 So maybe the small one.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_05
 But I mean, like, I have the black and white, I guess.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_05
 It just doesn't look funky enough.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_05
 But, I mean, like, even mobile phones or whatever, they have color LCD screens.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, I wouldn't know about the cost, so...

0:13:21	SPEAKER_02
 Uh-huh.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_04
 And, if I was not withstanding, is it too complicated?

0:13:26	SPEAKER_04
 Is it going to be too much overload?

0:13:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's the thing, because...

0:13:30	SPEAKER_00
 It will be easy, because there will be on LCD screens, there will be different, different icons.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_00
 They can just click, click, okay, whatever they want.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_04
 When you use the remote control, you never look at it, right?

0:13:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_02
 You're looking at TV.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's true, yeah.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_04
 And it just seems kind of like a...

0:13:45	SPEAKER_04
 And one of the survey findings was that they were...

0:13:47	SPEAKER_01
 And one of the findings was that they wanted it easy to use.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_01
 So, I think, I'm not sure about the LCD.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_01
 It's a great and good idea, but for our budget and for...

0:13:55	SPEAKER_01
 The thing we're trying to go for, easy to use, it's not the thing we should go for, I think.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_01
 Child friends, I thought this was good.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_01
 As you pointed out, the bit...

0:14:06	SPEAKER_01
 It often goes missing, especially with children.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_01
 But it's a good shape, and the organic is kind of...

0:14:12	SPEAKER_01
 We could make a vegetable-y kind of round shape, I think.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_01
 So, which vegetable?

0:14:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I know, carrot.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_05
 So, since we're going for the company colors, I think your lemon wasn't that important.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_01
 If it doesn't work, you know.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 But we don't want it to be lemon.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_01
 The child friend, the easy to use, it seems crazy.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_01
 She's like the different shapes of the buttons and stuff.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_01
 I think that's a good idea to take care of.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_01
 I like the colorful buttons as well.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:38	SPEAKER_01
 And the mouse one, I thought it was a good idea because people use mouse.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_01
 My mouse is now with this scrolling thing.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, we are marketing to sort of...

0:14:48	SPEAKER_05
...35 to 35, so most people will have common content.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_01
 So, they'd be able to use that.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_01
 As I said, I think I'd presume it would come up on the screen.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_01
 So, there you go.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_05
 That means you get to bump that bit to the TV makers.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_01
 So, that's the user interface.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_01
 It's low.

0:15:12	None
 Okay.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_01
 Take this out now, then.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:15:17	None
 Okay.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_04
 There are a lot of options that we're going to have to choose from among.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_04
 And I'll give you the technical considerations for those.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_04
 I don't even use the whiteboard just because we haven't used it.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:45	None
 I was just thinking to self-tune back.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_04
 So, who I'm going to do this is we're going to take a look at some old and old controls.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_04
 See how they work.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_04
 We used the final kind of...

0:15:57	SPEAKER_04
...and I'm going to use the whiteboard.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_04
 The final kind of essential pieces of it.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_04
 And then we'll throw in our new innovations and keep it all within budget.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_04
 So, looking inside a very simple amount of control.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_04
 This is what they sent me.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_04
 Here's the competition, I suppose.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_04
 You open it up.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_04
 There's a circuit board inside.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_04
 And there's a chip, a processor, the TA11835, which receives input from the buttons.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_05
 This is just a standard off the shelf kind of a chip.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_04
 It's very, very cheap.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_04
 Like this would cost nothing.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_04
 So, that takes the signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it sends to the amplifier, which is made of some transistors and amplifiers, op amps.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_04
 And then that gets sent to the LED light, which I can kind of see is a little red light bulb at the end.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_04
 And that sends out the infrared light signal to the television.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_04
 So, this is kind of the bare essentials that we need to have in our remote control.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_04
 That's what it defines.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_05
 So, can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum?

0:17:27	SPEAKER_04
 No, I mean, this is very old one, so now with a new technology, this is going to be a minimally small.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_05
 Almost a key thing.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_04
 So, this is what we need to have for a certain.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_04
 So, as I said, we've got the outer casing, the tray off the side.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_04
 You know, it's going to be the board we have to use this, the same setup.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_04
 And then we have the processor, we'll probably use the more advanced processor that I had, amplifier and transmitter all standard.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_04
 So, for the casing, this email I got from our manufacturing team, you know, we have a bunch of options from wood, titanium, rubber, plastic, whatnot, latex, double curve, so lots of choices, what do you think?

0:18:19	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I mean, latex has a kind of spongy feel to it, doesn't it?

0:18:26	SPEAKER_04
 It's very elastic for sure.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_05
 And that would also give a kind of durability.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_05
 And it's also relatively cheap to cast.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_05
 So, I'm going to base a sort of plastic, initial plastic with a latex kind of sheath.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_04
 So, I hear a plastic latex.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_01
 I like the rubber, the stress balls, I think, you know, that could be a bit of a gimmick, like it's good to hold.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_04
 So, something would give to it?

0:18:59	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_01
 And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_01
 The color is yellow, right?

0:19:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_01
 Or at least incorporated.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yellow incorporated, yeah.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, if we're going to, I don't know what other standard silver kind of other parts.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, the buttons, like, because there's going to be the cover, the rubber or the plastic casing, and then the buttons in probably two different colors.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_01
 Or if we're having buttons, actually.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_04
 So, yellow, and body.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_04
 And then what color for the buttons?

0:19:38	SPEAKER_05
 I quite like the multi-colored buttons.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_04
 So, multi-colored buttons.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_01
 You do have ones like playing, could be green or on and off as reds and stuff like that.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_01
 Or, yeah.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_01
 Makes it easy to use.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_05
 It makes it easier to use.

0:19:52	SPEAKER_05
 It doesn't look too childish.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

0:19:56	SPEAKER_01
 Because that blue one did look quite challenging.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_05
 Although, I mean, this also comes to shape as well.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, if we are going to make it a double, I mean, double curved sounds good to me.

0:20:06	SPEAKER_05
 If we're talking about some ergonomic and easy to use, that would be comfy.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_04
 So, the shape, what we want to go.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_04
 How exactly?

0:20:18	SPEAKER_01
 Like an hourglass kind of figures that were you thinking of?

0:20:24	SPEAKER_05
 Or just like it.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_05
 That'd be, that's sort of comfortable to hold, easy to hold, so you don't drop it.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_03
 What?

0:20:30	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_01
 We could make novelty remote controls.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_04
 Well, yeah.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_04
 We could have a big banana shape remote control.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_04
 Because it's yellow.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_03
 And a lemon might be a little bit hard to print.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_01
 But then how would you print it?

0:20:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_04
 How would you point it?

0:20:48	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't matter which I need to print.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_04
 We could have little LEDs in each end.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe we could have some ink.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_00
 I appreciate this idea because then this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate it with fruits and vegetables, the people's choices that whatever data shows that.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_00
 So this.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_01
 Would you, I'm sure a rather banana idea.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_05
 So, it's fun.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_05
 Rubber banana.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, yeah.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_05
 That does seem again childish for me.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_01
 I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetables shape.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_01
 What else did you say about fashion?

0:21:31	SPEAKER_00
 The fashion shows that fruits and vegetables.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_00
 Like people now.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_00
 And sponge.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_00
 And a file.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_04
 So it has a stem perhaps.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_01
 It'd be some.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_01
 Like what's that?

0:21:48	SPEAKER_01
 I don't even know the name of it.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_01
 So I'm kind of, you know, it's like, it looks like a little snowman kind of thing.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know the name of that.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_04
 So it looks like this kind of.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_01
 That's what I was thinking.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_01
 Like a gourd.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe that's like that.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_01
 Like a squawk.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_01
 Because that you can hold it in like the bottom bit and.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_04
 And it has a clear top and bottom.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_04
 So you know, transmits from the center.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_05
 Why the hell not?

0:22:13	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_01
 What do you think?

0:22:16	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I guess it's kind of, you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_00
 Then only we can relate it.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_00
 Something.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_04
 Exactly.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_04
 So double curved.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_04
 Single curved.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_00
 Or we can do something we can design two, three shapes and we can have a public survey.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_00
 Let the public choose what they want.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_05
 That's a good way.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_04
 That's a good idea.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_04
 I guess since you're the marketing guy.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_01
 And buttons.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_01
 Did we say different shapes or buttons?

0:23:01	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, for the specific functions, you know, up and down, play stock.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_05
 They've got, I mean, they've got standard sort of intuitive things that are always used.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_05
 And.

0:23:16	None
 Yeah.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_04
 That's cool.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_04
 I like it.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_01
 With a scroll wheel or no?

0:23:28	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_01
 What about the scroll wheel?

0:23:30	SPEAKER_05
 Speech recognition.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_05
 Speech recognition, I think.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_05
 So we need a microphone.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_05
 I can put the microphone.

0:23:38	None
 Yeah.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_04
 That's the microphone.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_05
 Worship.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use?

0:23:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'm not sure.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, those ideas I saw were just for inspiration, I think.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_01
 I do not do this for you.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I can.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_01
 No, I'm not sure.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_04
 Well, we can do some user tests with scroll wheel.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_05
 And I think if this new software for the same recognition as any key point,

0:24:07	SPEAKER_04
 keep it in the microphone. So should the microphone be just anywhere on it?

0:24:10	SPEAKER_05
 I would put it sort of substantially.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_05
 So it's.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_05
 So it can be sort of held and really, really going to need to hold it if it's going to be a voice recognition.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_04
 Not what we can.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_03
 Oops.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_01
 So let's not use the whiteboard anymore.

0:24:44	None
 Oops.

0:24:45	None
 Oops.

0:24:46	None
 Easy.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_05
 Oops.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_04
 Sorry.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_01
 And so what else was that?

0:24:54	SPEAKER_01
 The, what about the glow in the dark thing, the strip around it?

0:24:59	SPEAKER_01
 We just can leave that?

0:25:00	SPEAKER_01
 I still like it.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_01
 I like it.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_05
 But that's me.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_01
 Because we've got the technological innovation with the speech recognition.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_05
 Some of it is just going a bit too far.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, we are pushing it probably because of the fun and the shape.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_05
 And don't want to sort of.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_01
 Especially with yellow.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_05
 Because I mean, like, I mean, how good is the speech recognition thing?

0:25:25	SPEAKER_05
 Do we want to go for buttons at all?

0:25:27	SPEAKER_05
 Do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit?

0:25:31	SPEAKER_01
 You put it in the fruit bowl.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_01
 You know, and then you just work from it.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, everybody's got a fruit bowl in front of the tail.

0:25:39	SPEAKER_05
 Mm-hmm.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_04
 It could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_04
 Make them think of fruit.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_05
 Make sure they don't eat their mouth.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, yeah.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_05
 Do we need to?

0:25:56	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, I think of a fruit that could sit.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_05
 So then the pen lay on its own, like an apple.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_05
 It's just apples.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_05
 So yellow apples.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_05
 I quite like the shape.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_01
 I quite like the design of that.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_01
 Because that could sit on its own.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_01
 It's quite, got quite a sturdy base.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_01
 Groovy.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_01
 And as we say, we don't want to be too ridiculous with the fruit things.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_04
 About the speech thing, it doesn't have to be handheld.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_04
 Of course, it can set a distance.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_05
 So, I mean, like, you could actually...

0:26:31	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_00
 We can do one thing.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_00
 We can just have a remote control and casing some different different shapes, different fruit shapes in such a way that any casing could be fit into this mobile general piece.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_00
 So whatever people want, like, if somebody wanted it in banana shape, we will put that casing onto that mobile phone.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_00
 Absolutely.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_00
 It will look...

0:26:56	SPEAKER_00
 And yeah.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_00
 He said about disposable things.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry?

0:27:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_00
 Like, if this is a mobile phone, we will design casing in such a way like half of...

0:27:11	SPEAKER_00
 We need not to have a full cover.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_00
 We will just have a half of cover, okay?

0:27:15	SPEAKER_00
 Like, if somebody wants it in banana shape, we will fit banana shape casing onto that.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_00
 So it will give a banana shape look.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_00
 If somebody wanted it in apple shape, we will design that.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_00
 We will put apple shape casing on that.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_00
 It will give apple shape look.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_00
 So in that way, you can have any...

0:27:34	SPEAKER_00
 Means whatever you want.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_01
 Without...

0:27:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_01
 We need the buttons in the same place.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_00
 Buttons will be on the upper side.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_00
 Buttons will be on the upper side.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_00
 Buttons will be on the upper side.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_00
 Lower side, we will just put the casing.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_00
 So half of that will be looked...

0:27:48	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, half afraid.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_00
 Not the upper side.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_00
 So from lower, you can...

0:27:53	SPEAKER_00
 Means while you are holding from this side.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_00
 You can have banana look or apple look, whatever.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_00
 So in that way, we need not to have different different shape, mobiles, everything.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_00
 We will just design cravings through shape.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_05
 I think if you are going to have a fascia, then you want to have it so that it does go for the buttons.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_05
 Because if you think about it, if they are wanting it because they want to look at it, if they are using it, and what they want to look at is facing away from them, it doesn't really...

0:28:21	SPEAKER_05
 You know, because that would be in the palm of their hand.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_05
 Unless you have sort of...

0:28:27	SPEAKER_05
 You have the buttons option on one side.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_05
 You get the fascia on the other side with the microphone so that you can place it face down.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_05
 And you have got the fascia.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_05
 And you can just talk at them.

0:28:38	None
 Mm-hmm.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_05
 That'd be...

0:28:41	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_05
 So...

0:28:43	SPEAKER_05
 So you have narrowed it down to half a dozen options?

0:28:50	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_04
 So, I guess we decided on the material, right?

0:28:53	SPEAKER_04
 So that's spongy, latex, rubber, everything.

0:28:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_04
 And the color as we got down.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_04
 Your shape, maybe we'll just make it kind of mix and match type of shape or...

0:29:04	SPEAKER_01
 Well, because...

0:29:06	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I'm not sure if we should go so far on the whole fruit thing because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_01
 And because...

0:29:14	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_01
 We stick with what we've got later.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think we're trying to get to 25-35 year olds want it quite trendy as well.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_01
 They said they want it something that looks fancy.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_01
 And I think maybe fruit could be a bit of too much of a gimmick but something ergonomically shaped and organic, like good to hold based on fruits and natural things like that.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_01
 Because already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow, you know?

0:29:41	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, we could make it a nice pale yellow.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_05
 Well, it's kind of got to be our company, so...

0:29:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_05
 So, again, I mean, like we could have, I mean, we could quite easily have the main body be a difference.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with, you said, the logo.

0:29:59	SPEAKER_01
 The slogan.

0:30:00	SPEAKER_05
 The slogan.

0:30:01	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_05
 Because...

0:30:03	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, even if... I mean, not necessarily that the whole body has to be of the company color.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_05
 So, you know, blue and yellow tend to go through well together.

0:30:14	SPEAKER_05
 So you have main body blue with the yellow, local and slogan running up one side of it.

0:30:20	None
 Yeah.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_02
 Uh-huh.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_05
 Sure.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_04
 As for the energy source, you know, almost every commercial is just batteries, but we don't have to be limited by that.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_04
 We can use a hand dynamo.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_05
 Uh-huh.

0:30:39	SPEAKER_05
 I think it's basically the more you move it, it's got everything inside that just kind of powers it.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_04
 So those watches that you see.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, it's a dynamo?

0:30:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_01
 Like with those watches that you...

0:30:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_01
 So it's fine too.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_04
 It's not working.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_04
 I just keep holding the reaction anyways.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_00
 But, but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo?

0:31:03	SPEAKER_00
 Uh-huh.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_00
 These type of cells because then people have to like if this hell is out.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_00
 That's a leap of navigation too.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, too.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_05
 Especially if they want to use it specifically as voice activated.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_01
 Because most of the people...

0:31:17	SPEAKER_01
 And they have to pick it up and then activate it and then yeah.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_05
 That's true.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_04
 Um, while we have an option, there's solar power.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_00
 Uh, solar power will also not be a good idea because then they have to keep their mobiles outside.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_00
 And the day's when there is no solar sunlight.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_00
 I'm with Raj on that.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_00
 I think.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_00
 I've got north facing houses.

0:31:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_00
 I think we should rechargeable.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_00
 Uh-huh.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_00
 Battery will be a good idea.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_00
 They can...

0:31:45	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, how about that idea that I thought, um, just on the basis of like reading them with batteries and that kind of bother.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_01
 And we're very environmentally friendly.

0:31:56	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_05
 And we have a rechargeable stand so that not only it almost stands but, um, for using it as recharging it but also for using it as sound recognition.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_01
 Like a hand, like one of those portable phones.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_04
 Exactly.

0:32:15	SPEAKER_04
 So, uh, a rechargeable battery.

0:32:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_04
 Um, the user face the buttons.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_04
 I guess we talked about this very much.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_05
 On print puts, sorry.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_05
 Nevermind.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_04
 The electronics, um, basically the more features we add.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_04
 Um, so the more features we add the answer chips we need to buy and put in, which adds to the cost.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_04
 Um, but, uh, I think we can keep it all in the budget.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_04
 So, yeah.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_04
 So the speech thing you said are, are technology research and development department came up with some breakthrough.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_05
 So, and if we're just having buttons on the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_05
 Chiping.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_05
 That's good.

0:33:11	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_05
 We're kind of, um, I've just deleted that whole thing.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_05
 Um, we're kind of running at time.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_05
 So if you could.

0:33:25	None
 Um, Was that you?

0:33:33	SPEAKER_05
 That was your bit covered up.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, that was just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to see next.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_04
 Um, yeah.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_01
 So, yeah, I'm sure I think.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, mine seems to have turned off.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_00
 I just touched the pad.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_05
 It does.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_05
 That's the bad.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_05
 It's actually shut down.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_05
 It's on, but there's no.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:33:56	SPEAKER_05
 Um, now what we have our next meeting in half an hour.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_05
 What I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, I guess they do it.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_04
 Cool.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_05
 So, um, you know, I mean, luckily we chose a nice simple shape.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_05
 Um, and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches.

0:34:23	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:34:24	SPEAKER_04
 That's great.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_04
 Save everything to the shared documents.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, yeah, I hope I can recover this because of that.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_05
 We deleted it.

0:34:31	SPEAKER_05
 Which doesn't really help me much.

0:34:34	SPEAKER_01
 I think I saved mine already.

0:34:36	None
 Yeah.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_05
 Can you say if I send that last one again, please, Raj?

0:34:41	SPEAKER_05
 I still can't find it on there.

0:34:43	SPEAKER_00
 Uh, it was under a different name.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_00
 I will show you.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_00
 In shared documents.

0:34:47	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_00
 Uh, but the components.

0:34:52	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, you didn't get that.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_00
 I will put it in shared documents.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_05
 Um, yeah.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_05
 Project project project.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_00
 Project documents.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_00
 I put it in the shared documents.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_05
 That's actually that it goes there automatically.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_05
 If you put it in project documents, project documents is on the, um, desktop.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_00
 But I can't open that because it asks for some username or password.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_04
 I'll show you.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_05
 All right.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_05
 I think, um, hold on.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:35:41	SPEAKER_05
 I don't know if you, it just can't just came up on my, um, on my agenda.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_05
 Um, presumably this clay somewhere.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_05
 Um,

0:35:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. That's good.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_05
 Whoops.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_05
 Light, light, please light.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:36:06	SPEAKER_05
 There you go.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_05
 Thank you.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_05
 Quite.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_05
 We're using this sort of basic chipset.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_05
 So.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_05
 Sorry.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_00
 You have to keep your pen separate.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_00
 I used your pen.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, sorry.

0:36:26	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_05
 Still didn't manage to get that.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_05
 And although that's so we have the chargeable.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_05
 And.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:36:46	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_05
 See.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_02
 Cool.

0:37:02	SPEAKER_02
 Fine.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_05
 I knew that actually the sort of engineered it so we ended up making a difficult shape.

0:37:11	SPEAKER_05
 It's for cruelty.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_01
 Starth rate.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, like literally make it sort of buttons and everything.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_01
 No, we can do buttons.

0:37:25	SPEAKER_00
 Um, we are going to discuss something.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_05
 Uh, no, I think that's a discussion over and less anybody's got questions.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_05
 Confusions because I'm confused.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_04
 Mm hmm.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_04
 Let's get.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_05
 Um, we'll probably get a question in a minute.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_05

 Sorry.

0:37:49	SPEAKER_00

0:38:03	SPEAKER_05
 I'm going to be going to a document.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_05

0:38:13	None
 There we go.
