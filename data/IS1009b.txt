0:01:15	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, you want me to start right now?

0:01:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_04
 How could you put my slides up because I think it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time?

0:01:26	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_04
 You are a participant.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_04
 Full-puppetant for, I believe, yes.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_03
 Mm-hmm.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_03
 And now I can full-screen open.

0:01:44	None
 Okay.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_04
 There we go.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I think we have introduced ourselves.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_04
 So the functional requirements is part of my goal.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_04
 But why don't we pass right to the second slide?

0:01:59	SPEAKER_04
 Because that's where my discussion starts.

0:02:03	None
 All right.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_04
 Well, since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it, I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_04
 And the reason I just put that there like that is that in the initial stage, I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_04
 You know, you can say anything you want, no matter how silly it sounds, you know, it should run your car, it should heat up your motor, it should turn on your CD or whatever you want it to do.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_04
 And then as we go on, what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_04
 So I'll be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it's going to be to add a feature or how expensive it's going to be or if your time takes five years to develop this, it's just something we can't do.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_04
 So in the beginning, just have a big puddle of things that we, anybody can throw anything in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_04
 And then the things that seem the most attractive to a customer will try to then prioritize those. So that was what I meant there.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_04
 And as I said on the slide, they're consulting the industrial engineer about that.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_04
 And the other thing is, time is really going to be as important as money because if we're going to sell this thing, I think the best time to sell it is a Christmas present.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_04
 25 euros makes an ice-settle present and we want it to be an impulse purchase. We want somebody to see it and think it's, I just got to have that and take out their wallet and buy it.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_04
 So it's got to be really attractive. But it's got to go to market by September because anything that you don't have already out there in September, showing it around isn't get a sell for Christmas.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_04
 And then I'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to help me with that prioritizing of the features and of the look and the color.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_04
 I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view. So are you coming to you for how much is it going to cost and how long is it going to take you?

0:04:25	SPEAKER_04
 And I'll be coming to you to tell me what's going to make somebody take out their wallet. You know what's going to really be what they call the sizzle because we got to sell the sizzle.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_04
 A lot of times the thing that works the best for an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just going to take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for their child or for their husband or whatever.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, can we go to the next slide please?

0:04:54	SPEAKER_04
 I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the whole house idea really isn't going to be possible. So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we can suggest anything.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_04
 I'd like the suggestions to be really specific so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off. Not something like, you know, whole house control.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_04
 And then I found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible at the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at we should be able to make it work the TV, the VCR, the stereo set, maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_03
 Can I at this point interject something we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_03
 The one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext because that's sort of outdated.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_03
 And according to higher management, it should only control the TV mostly because they feel that it's too complex to task to include other things and they're concerned with the time to market.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_03
 Of course.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_03
 And the third thing that they want to make sure that the corporate image is being maintained and that the corporate color and design are being used on the product so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_03
 So I just wanted to check this here so we're not going to too much of track here with with the things we want to look at.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_03
 These were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate these things.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, it's going to be TV.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_03
 But the one thing maybe that could be eliminated.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_03
 So tell a text idea.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. All right.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_04
 Thanks for that.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_04
 All right. Now, other things that I found out in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now is a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_04
 And that was 34% and even more important.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_04
 The thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room.

0:07:28	SPEAKER_04
 So those are two things that we definitely do want to address. We want to make it as simple as possible. We want to make it obvious and intuitive to use.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_04
 And then the things about finding it.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_04
 We talked about the light emitting thing as well as maybe a beep.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_04
 And I think that those are things after my research that we definitely want to try to incorporate. Can we go to the next slide, please?

0:07:59	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. So my personal preferences in this project are we really have to concentrate on the sizzle.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_04
 That is the selling point. The thing that's going to make it an impulse purchase.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_04
 Because once there's no be back in sales, they always say, you know, be back, don't come back. If somebody says, oh, I'll come back and get it next week, you're dead. They're never going to come back and buy it.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_04
 You've got to make it attractive enough so they buy it now, now, now, now is a big word in my book for selling this thing.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_04
 And in order to make it really saleable, we've got to shorten the learning curve, make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use. We have to have as few buttons as possible.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_04
 Because more buttons is more confusion. So that's why I'm saying simplicity is good. Finding it's important. Obviously you can't use it if you can't find it.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_04
 So we've got to concentrate on the features that help you find it. And I've already said this several times, but I put it down in writing here. It should be an attractive impulse purchase at 25 euros.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_04
 So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it, this 25 euros, I'm not going to take that. It has to be so great that they're going to say, oh, 25 euros isn't much.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_04
 And then maybe a motto, like we put fashion and electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, that's about it for me right now.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. And who would be next? I guess that would be you.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah. You want me to get your slideshow up.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_03
 And you are number three.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_03
 Number two.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:09:50	None
 Okay.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_00
 Can you make it a full screen please?

0:09:58	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, that's like, well, you have to press here.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_01
 The method is like in a remote control, you have a chip integrated circuit, which is like a brain of the remote controller.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_01
 It takes the power from a battery, say a battery, it can't be an electric supply, like you have to switch, connect your remote controller to a power supply from the electricity or something like that.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_01
 It should be a battery because a remote controller should be like you should take it to wherever you want.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_01
 And then this integrated circuit takes energy from the power source and whatever, like if you press a button, it's like an input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it transforms into an infrared bits and it sends it to the device, like a TV or air conditioner, something like that.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_01
 So a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device. If you want to design it for multiple devices, then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency, like the remote controller, it sends some bits, some waves, like with a particular frequency, the device should know what the frequency is.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_01
 It should recognize the waves, which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action, like if you press a button channel or something like that, then the remote control will send a signal, and the TV, it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that, change the volume control.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_01
 So I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, well, that's already been eliminated by management.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so we're off the hook.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_01
 So user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages, like there should be a user user interface, like you know, switch pad or something like that, buttons should be there.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_01
 So you can control whatever you want, you want to change the channel, you want to control the volume, you want to mute the TV or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations, there should be some device to tell what to do to the integrated circuit.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_01
 So that the integrated circuit can send the signals and TV can perform the actions.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_01
 So can you go to the next slide please. I just would like to add some extra features to the remote controller.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_01
 I think these are the very simple features and they don't take much of the investment also.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 It's like the text or buttons which are there on the remote controller.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_01
 Those we can make like fluorescent, they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote control if it is dark.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_01
 And there should be a beep, if many buttons are pressed, if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time, then there should be a beep saying that this is not a, you know, action, there can be no action taken to that. So and there should be a child lock like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child, they can't be like, if you have keep kids and all, then they will be playing with the remote controller.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_01
 So can lock the remote controller. Make it usable for more than one device. It's hard but it's possible.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, well, that has been eliminated. So that's that's unfortunately a mute point now.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_01
 And different shapes that we can do like we can have, you know, all animal shapes or, you know, comfortable which can fit into your hands.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_04
 Now that's good from a marketing point of view, the fun shape.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, you say that won't add too much to the budget.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_01
 No, I don't think it will be like you can have, you know, if you want to build the mold basically.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_03
 And, you know, as a budget, we're looking at if you build one mold, I don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's going to be square or.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_04
 Do you think there's any chance of having so having basically the same machine with the same buttons, but maybe several different shapes?

0:14:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that is not the best of it.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yes.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_03
 Is that going to be possible? Because that will help with the marketing.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_03
 I think we will have to look at the budget on that, but I think in principle that that will be that will be kind of fun.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_04
 Because we had something sort of sexy for adults, so we could have something sort of silly for children or animals.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_02
 Like an animal or an animal or an animal.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_04
 Or a little elephant so they can remember where it is.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_01
 And the button, buttons also, I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller, then there should be more buttons.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_01
 If there are more buttons, then it will be more complicated.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_01
 If you have less features, then your remote controller won't be attractive.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_01
 So I think we need to make some buttons which are like in two or three operations.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_01
 Like if you press one button in one mode, then it will change the channel.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_01
 If you press the other button in another mode, it will change the color.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_01
 So if you want to have less buttons, we can have that option, but I think it will complicate them at a more, I think.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss with user interface person.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_04
 Because I think there's a lot of arguments we made for one button, for one feature.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_04
 Because I think one of the things people were complaining about when I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_04
 The changing modes was something...

0:15:58	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's like you.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_04
 I mean you and I all four of us who work with computers all the time, changing modes is nothing for us.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_04
 But people who...

0:16:06	SPEAKER_03
 A little, a little, a little aesthetic hand, and it's a small button and they don't press it exactly.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_03
 Something else happens, not their favorite channel comes up with something else and they're very frustrated.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_04
 It's the kind of thing people learn by feel.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_04
 You don't feel the mode change.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe having buttons be various shapes might be helped.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, shapes are also different.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_04
 …a triangle for the volume and a square is for changing channels so that people can develop a tactile sense of it.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_04
 …But we'll get to that with you.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_01
 Also text should be very clear so that there won't be any ambiguity.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's a good point.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_01
 And display clock, if you want more features, then we can display a clock.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_01
 I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's a good point.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_04
 Because the clock could be really friendly.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_04
 When is your favorite channel coming on?

0:17:07	SPEAKER_03
 You see that there already or maybe you have no other…

0:17:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, a lot of times there's not a clock on the screen and you have to go somewhere but you just want to look at the news for a minute.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's good.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_04
 The clock is good.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_01
 Can you go to the next slide please?

0:17:20	SPEAKER_01
 The main components we need for it are like buttons and underneath that there should be switch and bolts.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_01
 We can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the TV is on, suppose.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_01
 Then the remote controller should automatically have a light.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_01
 Then it will be like if you switch on your TV through another source, not through a remote controller and you lost your remote controller.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can find with the light.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can have that.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_01
 Whenever the TV is on, remote controller will have a light.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_01
 Then infrared bulbs.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_01
 This is like when it is dark.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_01
 And battery, there should be a battery for power supply.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_01
 And a chip which is like a brain to the controller, which does all the operations.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_01
 And wires connecting all chips which is lights everything.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_01
 So there should be wires.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_01
 And of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and different shapes or whatever it is.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_01
 There should be a case to give us a shape.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_00
 To keep the remote.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_02
 A case holder.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_02
 A holder.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_00
 A holder.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_00
 A holder.

0:18:37	None
 Yes.

0:18:38	None
 Yeah.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_00
 A holder.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_00
 Next slide please.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_01
 I have referred the site, the homepage of the website from where I got a few points.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_01
 That's it.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_01
 That's it from me now.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_04
 So we should visit this site and have a look at what's up there.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, you don't have to.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_01
 It's not like that.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_01
 I have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all this.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_04
 So it might be helpful if we had a look at that.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, if you want.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:19:26	None
 Thank you.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_04
 Did you go back to that slide where she had that slide up Betsy?

0:19:35	SPEAKER_01
 It's actually there on the screen.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_01
 This one?

0:19:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:42	None
 Thank you.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_03
 And, Frances.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_02
 I'm dispensed to.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_02
 You are number two?

0:20:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, I'm three.

0:20:03	None
 You three.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_02
 As a user interface designer, I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_02
 I can you please go on to the next slide.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_02
 So I found out that the main purpose of a remote is to control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_02
 Now for that, a remote controller should have a switch on of button by which a user can set anywhere in the room in front of the TV and I can control the functionalities, different functionalities of the TV.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_02
 There should be a signal, something like a radio wave or an infrared light or a lead which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_02
 If the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume, he can change it.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_02
 Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular program or switching on and off a particular program according to the user on the remote.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_02
 So if we want to view a particular program, let's say 9 o'clock, he can set the time and the TV will automatically switch on at that particular time.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_02
 So he can use that kind of properties or features and then there should be a child lock system.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_02
 If a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age, then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the children cannot view that channel.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_02
 And one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the remote.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_02
 The remote should be compact and it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the TV, television.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_02
 And this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T and alphabet for more compactability.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_02
 And there's one more point which I noted it down.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_02
 Like the material which is used for remote should be human friendly.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_02
 It should not cause any skin disease or something, some allergy to either children or to an adult person.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_02
 And it should have an alarm clock.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_02
 A person, if somebody wants to get a put around 8 p.m. and he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_02
 And I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_02
 If there is a clock then there can be a clock.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_02
 And as Janvi said, the buttons can be, we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_02
 So different buttons will glow differently.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_02
 So even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to sit on a particular channel.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_02
 And the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_02
 So that if a child plays with a remote he should not be harmed in any way.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_02
 And findings.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_02
 I found out different sites that there are different remotes which can be used.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_02
 There are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_02
 There are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_02
 And there are, so there you have different types of remotes with different light source which I use which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_02
 And these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_02
 Not no, like it can be used as a TV control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm timing.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_02
 And it should have a child lock.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_02
 And then to save electricity there should not be much more, lots of circuits and all that.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_02
 And if a person, if a parent wants the television to be switched off by 10 o'clock then it should be switched off at 10 o'clock automatically.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_02
 So that nobody else comes later and use it.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, it's like a timer here.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_02
 Timer?

0:24:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_02
 And then you can use a timer as well.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's it.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_00
 No, I have.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_03
 Well, my slideshow basically we already, we have already done the agenda and on the closing basically they would be lunch break and all that.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_03
 However, the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group and what function, working design, how does it work.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_03
 So these are the two things we should come up with.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_03
 So the first thing is maybe a little easier on the who is our target group.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_03
 I guess in many ways everybody, everybody who has a TV.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_02
 Television viewers.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a TV.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_03
 They are a few but in general not.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_03
 Now talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody but I think within the target group we have subgroups.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_03
 We have earlier, it was mentioned about for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers in hand.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_03
 So I think that's one group that's certainly important.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_03
 Then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it's really very clear.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_03
 And I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_03
 I mean that's a question whether that's important that children can really use it or not.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_03
 So these are just some thoughts I have on it.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_03
 And I don't know what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're going to design this one thing or whether we're looking at what we're talking about different shapes, whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_04
 Well you know there's the old motto, children under six never shop alone.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_04
 So if you design something that's very attractive to children, the mummy please, mummy please we want it now, we want to go to the store and see it.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_04
 That has a lot of a lot of.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_03
 That has a lot of a pull.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_03
 That has a lot of a peel but I think I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_03
 I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colors.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_03
 That's right.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_03
 You know like you make nice and pink, fluorescent banana color or whatever.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_03
 You can make a banana shape too.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, for example.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_03
 But the question is really who is our target group, do we look at one target group and with the 25-year-olds you know can we afford to have, I'm asking the technical people here whether to look at the sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group, how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect?

0:28:54	SPEAKER_02
 Generally we can design a remote which is mainly for people with age from 10 to 40 and then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people with who have nervous problems, maybe we can design different remote for

0:29:19	SPEAKER_01
 different people like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know in a family

0:29:24	SPEAKER_02
 there will be a aged person, children and a middle age but they cannot buy three different remote.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_02
 They would like to buy just one and just one which can be used by all the three of course

0:29:36	SPEAKER_01
 that we can do but specifically if like elderly people want a big button then you can't really make a big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big remote computer and for children.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_04
 What about the electronics that's not really going to change much is it?

0:29:53	SPEAKER_04
 No, that won't change much will it?

0:29:58	SPEAKER_03
 The question to be addressed here is only who is a target group and how will it function and I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know within the target group or subgroups.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_03
 The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_03
 I mean the basic design I understand will be the same but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say 40% remake large buttons and the rest remake regular buttons for example.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_03
 So that remains to be seen but target group as a whole is basically everybody is a TV.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_03
 That's alright.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_04
 And can we is it even feasible to make one remote control with something for everyone or we have to try to use the same electronics and make three different shapes.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah well that's the question.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_04
 The same electronics and basically all that's going to be different is the plastic case and in that case we could probably molded plastic isn't all that expensive is it?

0:31:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yes and industrial person.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_03
 Well maybe there's an idea you know the new for example new portable phones they have like removable plastic cases so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one or whatever and maybe something like that that in each package you know you have.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_03
 You have for example you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have another color or a stripe whatever that already comes in the package and then if people really want more colors they can buy separately.

0:31:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah like mobile phones we have different you know covers.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_03
 That's right but like if then everybody is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the stripe to whatever they have has another one in the package then they can go to the store and for a few Frank's or Euros whatever they can buy an alternate package.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_03
 An alternate package with another two colors in it you know for example.

0:32:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah okay.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah I have a doubt like will it be because twice effective if we if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remote for three different categories of people.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_03
 Well I think my idea here is to design one remote and what the only change is going to be the functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_03
 Having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people either for children five minutes I guess that's the old message.

0:32:55	SPEAKER_03
 Good morning finish meeting now.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_04
 Well we may have to come back to one of these points that are next meeting but I think

0:33:09	SPEAKER_03
 we do some more research. I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_03
 Do we agree on that in principle like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_03
 So now I understand it's lunch break.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_00
 And so that's what we want to do.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_00

0:33:40	None

0:33:41	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:33:42	SPEAKER_00
 And see you once a lot.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_00
