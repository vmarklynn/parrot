0:00:00	None
 I'm okay.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, is everybody ready?

0:00:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_04
 Just put on my microphone here and I'll be right with you.

0:00:45	None
 Okay.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_03
 I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_03
 And I think the marketing manager probably should go first addressing the needs and desires.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, you want me to start right now?

0:01:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:01:19	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_04
 Could you put my slides up because I think it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time.

0:01:28	None
 Okay.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_04
 You're a participant.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_04
 I'm a participant for I believe yes.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, and now I can full screen open.

0:01:45	None
 Okay.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_04
 There we go.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, well, I think we have introduced ourselves.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_04
 So the functional requirements is part of my goal.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_04
 But why don't we pass it right to the second slide?

0:02:00	SPEAKER_04
 Because that's where my discussion starts.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_04
 Well, since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_04
 I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_04
 And the reason I just put that there like that is that in the initial stage, I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_04
 You know, you can say anything you want, no matter how silly it sounds.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_04
 You know, it should run your car.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_04
 It should heat up your motor.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_04
 It should turn on your seat either whatever you want it to do.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_04
 And then as we go on, what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility.

0:02:45	SPEAKER_04
 So I'll be coming to you frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it's going to be to add a feature or how expensive it's going to be.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_04
 Or if your time takes five years to develop this, it's just something we can't do.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_04
 So in the beginning, just have a big puddle of things that we, anybody can throw anything in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_04
 And then the things that seem the most attractive to a customer will try to then prioritize those.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_04
 So that was what I meant there.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_04
 And as I said on the slide, they're consulting the industrial engineer about that.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_04
 And the other thing is time is really going to be as important as money because if we're going to sell this thing, I think the best time to sell this is Christmas present.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_04
 Twenty five euros makes a nice little present and we want it to be an impulse purchase.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_04
 We want somebody to see it and think it's, I just got to have that and take out their wallet and buy it.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_04
 So it's got to be really attractive.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_04
 But it's got to go to market by September because anything that you don't have already out there in September showing it around isn't going to sell for Christmas.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_04
 And then I'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to help me with that prioritizing of the features and of the look and the color.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_04
 And I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view. So we're coming to you for how much is it going to cost and how long is it going to take you?

0:04:25	SPEAKER_04
 And I'll be coming to you to tell me what's going to make somebody take out their wallet.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_04
 You know, what's going to really be what they call a sizzle because we've got to sell the sizzle.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_04
 A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just going to take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for their child or for their husband or whatever.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, can we go to the next slide please?

0:04:55	SPEAKER_04
 Alright, I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_04
 And it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the whole house idea really isn't going to be possible.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_04
 So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we could suggest anything.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_04
 I'd like the suggestions to be really specific so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off, not something like, you know, whole house control.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_04
 And then I found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_04
 At the budget that we're looking at, and at the price point we're looking at, we should be able to make it work the TV, the VCR, the stereo set, maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, can I at this point interject something?

0:05:47	SPEAKER_03
 We have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_03
 The one thing for example, something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext because that's sort of outdated with the internet.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_03
 And according to higher management, it should only control the TV mostly because they feel that it's too complex a task to include other things and they're concerned with the time to market.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_03
 And the third thing that they want to make sure that the corporate image is being maintained and that the corporate color and design are being used on the product so that it's easy, that they can be easily identified as a product of the company and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_03
 So I just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much of track here with the things we want to look at.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_03
 These were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate these things.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_03
 It's only going to be TV but the one thing maybe that could be eliminated is the teletext idea.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, okay.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_03
 All right, thanks for that.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_04
 All right, now other things that I found out in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now, there's a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use and that was 34% and even more important.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_04
 The thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_04
 So those are two things that we definitely do want to address.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_04
 Now we want to make it as simple as possible. We want to make it obvious and intuitive to use.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_04
 And then the things about finding it.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_04
 We talked about the light emitting thing as well as maybe a beep.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_04
 And I think that those are things after my research that we definitely want to try to incorporate.

0:07:57	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, can we go to the next slide please?

0:07:59	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so my personal preference is in this project.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_04
 We really have to concentrate on the sizzle.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_04
 That is the selling point, the thing that's going to make it an impulse purchase.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_04
 Because once there's no be back in sales they always say, you know, be back, don't come back.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_04
 If somebody says, oh, I'll come back and get it next week, you're dead.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_04
 They're never going to come back and buy it.

0:08:22	SPEAKER_04
 You've got to make it attractive enough so they buy it now, now, now as a big word in my book for selling this thing.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_04
 And in order to make it really saleable, we've got to shorten the learning curve, make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_04
 We have to have as few buttons as possible because more buttons is more confusion.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_04
 So that's why I'm saying simplicity is good.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_04
 Finding it's important, obviously you can't use it if you can't find it.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_04
 So we've got to concentrate on the features that help you find it.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_04
 And I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_04
 It should be an attractive impulse purchase at 25 euros.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_04
 So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it, this 25 euros, I'm not going to take that.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_04
 It has to be so great that they're going to say, oh, 25 euros isn't much.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_04
 And then maybe a motto, like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, that's about it for me right now.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_03
 And who would be next?

0:09:27	SPEAKER_03
 I guess that would be you.

0:09:31	SPEAKER_03
 You want me to get your slideshow up?

0:09:34	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_03
 And you are number three?

0:09:42	SPEAKER_03
 Number two.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_00
 Can you make it a full screen, please?

0:09:57	SPEAKER_00
 No, that's like, yeah, you have to press here.

0:10:03	None
 Cup shape.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_01
 So today I'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_01
 Can you go to the next slide, please?

0:10:16	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_01
 The method is like in a remote controller, you have a chip integrated circuit, which is like a brain of the remote controller.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_01
 It takes the power from a battery, say a battery.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_01
 It can be an electric supply, like you have to switch connect your remote controller to power supply from the electricity or something like that.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_01
 It should be a battery, because remote controller should be like you should take it to wherever you want.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_01
 And then this integrated circuit takes energy from the power source and whatever, like if you press a button, it's like an input for the remote controller.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_01
 And it takes the input and it transforms into infrared bits and it sends it to the device, like a TV or a conditioner, something like that.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_01
 So a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_01
 If you want to design it for multiple devices, then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_01
 Like the remote controller, it sends some bits, some waves, like with a particular frequency.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_01
 The device should know what the frequency is.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_01
 It should recognize the waves, which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_01
 Like if you press a button channel or something like that, then the remote controller will send a signal.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_01
 And the TV, it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that, change the volume control.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_01
 And so I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well that's already been eliminated by management.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_04
 We're off the hook.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_01
 So user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_01
 Like there should be a user interface like a switchpad or something like that, buttons should be there.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_01
 So you can control whatever you want, you want to change the channel, you want to control the volume, you want to mute the TV or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_01
 There should be some device to tell what to do to the integrated circuit so that integrated circuit can send the signals and TV can perform the actions.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_01
 So can you go to the next slide please?

0:12:44	SPEAKER_01
 I just would like to add some extra features to the remote controller.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_01
 I think these are the very simple features and they don't take much of the investment also.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 It's like the text or buttons which are there on the remote controller.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_01
 Those we can make like florocent.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_01
 They'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote control if it is dark.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_01
 And there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_01
 If suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that this is not a action, there can be no action taken to that.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_01
 And there should be a child lock like you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like if you have kids and all then they will be playing with remote controllers so you can lock the remote controller.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_01
 Make it usable for more than one device. It's hard but I think it's possible.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah well that has been eliminated so that's unfortunately a mute point now.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_01
 And different shapes that we can do like we can have you know all animal shapes or you know comfortable which can fit into your hands.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_04
 That's good from a marketing point of view the fun shape.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_04
 You say that won't add too much to the budget to the shape.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it will be like you can have you know if you want to.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_01
 It just builds them all basically and you know it's just a second shape so it doesn't matter.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_03
 As a budget we're looking at if you build one mold I don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's going to be square or.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_04
 Do you think there's any chance of having so having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah that is all different shapes.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_03
 Is that going to be possible?

0:14:46	SPEAKER_03
 I think we'll have to look at the budget on that but I think in principle that that will be that will be kind of fun.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_03
 Because we had something sort of sexy for adults.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_04
 So we could have something sort of silly for children.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_02
 Like an animal.

0:14:58	None
 An Or an animal.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_04
 Or an elephant so they can remember where it is.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_01
 And the button buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_01
 If there are more buttons then it will be more complicated.

0:15:14	SPEAKER_01
 If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_01
 So I think we need to make some buttons which are which are like in in it for two or three operations.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_01
 Like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_01
 If you press the other button in another mode it will change the color.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_01
 So if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but I think it will complicate the matter more.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_04
 I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss with the user interface person.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_04
 Because I think there's a lot of arguments we made for one button for one feature.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_04
 I think one of the things people were complaining about when I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_04
 The changing modes were something.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_04
 You and I all four of us work with computers all the time.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_04
 Changing modes is nothing for us.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_03
 But people who...

0:16:07	SPEAKER_03
 A little arthritic hand you know and it's a small button and they don't press it exactly.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_03
 Something else happens and not their favorite channel comes up with something else and they're very frustrated.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_04
 It's the kind of thing people learn by feel.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_04
 You don't feel the mode change.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_04
 So maybe having buttons be various shapes might be helped.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah shapes also different.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_04
 You know like the triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_04
 So that people can develop a tactile sense of it.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_04
 But we'll get to that with you.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_01
 Also text should be very clear so that there won't be any ambiguities.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_01
 That's a good point.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_01
 And display clock if you want more features then we can display a clock.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think it will take any extra money because we have a little bit of a circuit.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_01
 I think we can definitely fit that feature into the circuit.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah that's a good one.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_04
 Because the clock could be really friendly.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_04
 When is your favorite channel coming off?

0:17:08	SPEAKER_03
 You see there on the radio maybe you have no other...

0:17:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen and you have to go somewhere but you just want to look at the news for a minute.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah that's good.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_04
 The clock is good.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_01
 Can you go to the next slide please.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_01
 The main components may need for buttons and underneath that there should be switch and bulbs.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_01
 We can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the TV is on suppose.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_01
 Then the remote controller should automatically have a light.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_01
 Then it will be like if you switch on your TV through another source not from through a remote controller and you lost your remote controller.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can find with the light.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can have that.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_01
 Whenever the TV is on remote controller will have a light.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_01
 And then infrared bulbs.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_01
 This is like when it is dark.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_01
 And battery there should be a battery for power supply.

0:18:10	SPEAKER_01
 And a chip which is like a brain to the controller which does all the operations.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_01
 And why it's connecting all chips which is lights everything.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_01
 So there should be wires.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_01
 And of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and you know different shapes or whatever it is.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_01
 There should be a case to give a shape.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_00
 To keep the remote.

0:18:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_02
 Case.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_02
 Case holder.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_02
 A holder.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_00
 Next slide please.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_01
 I have referred the site the whole page of the website from where I have a few points.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_01
 That's it.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_01
 That's it from me now.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_04
 So we should visit this site and have a look at what's up there.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, you don't have to.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_01
 It's not like that.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_01
 I have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all the things.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_04
 So it might be helpful if we had a look at that.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, if you want.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:19:27	None
 Thank you.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_04
 Did you go back to that slide where she had that side up Betsy?

0:19:36	SPEAKER_01
 It's actually been on the screen.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_03
 This one?

0:19:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:41	None
 Okay.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_03
 And Frances.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_02
 I'm just going to.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_02
 You are number two.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, I'm three.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_03
 Would you want the tool for screen?

0:20:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_02
 As a user interface designer, I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, can you please go on to the next slide?

0:20:27	SPEAKER_02
 So I found out that the main purpose of a remote is to control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_02
 Now for that a remote controller should have a switch on of button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the TV and can control the functionality, different functionalities of the TV.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_02
 There should be a signal, something like a radio wave or an infrared light or a lead which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_02
 If the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume, he can change it.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_02
 Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular program or switching on and off a particular program according to the user choice.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_03
 On the remote.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_02
 So if you want to view a particular program at say 9 o'clock, he can set the time and the TV will automatically switch on at that particular time.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_02
 So he can use that kind of properties of features and then there should be a child lock system.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_02
 If a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age, then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the children cannot change.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_02
 Children cannot view that channel.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_02
 And the one of the features a user would like to have is the compactness of the remote.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_02
 The remote should be compact and it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the TV, television.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_02
 And as this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T, an alphabet for more compactability.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_02
 And there is one more point which I noted it down.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_02
 Like the material which is used for remote should be human friendly.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_02
 It should not cause any skin disease or something.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_02
 Some energy by the children not to adult person.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_02
 And it should have an alarm clock.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_02
 A person if somebody wants to get a put around 8 p.m. and he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_02
 And I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_02
 If there is a clock then there can be a test.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_02
 And as John we said the buttons can be, we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_02
 So different buttons will glow differently.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_02
 So even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to set a particular channel.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_02
 And the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be sharp projections.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_02
 So that if a child plays with a remote he should not be harmed in any way.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_02
 And findings.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_02
 I found out in different sites that there are different remotes which can be used.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_02
 There are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_02
 There are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_02
 And there are, so you have different types of remotes with different light source.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_02
 Which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_02
 Next thing.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_02
 And these are my few personal preferences.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_02
 Like it can be used for a multipurpose use.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_02
 Not, no.

0:24:22	SPEAKER_02
 Like it can, it can be used as a TV control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm timing.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_02
 And it should have a child lock.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_02
 And then to save electricity there should not be much more, lots of circuits and all that.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_02
 And if a person, if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock, then it should be switched off at ten o'clock automatically.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_02
 So that nobody else comes later and use it.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, it's like a timer here.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_02
 And then you can use a timer as well.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's it.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_00
 Now I have...

0:25:33	SPEAKER_03
 On my slideshow, basically we have already done the agenda.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_03
 And on the closing, basically there would be lunch break and all that.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_03
 However, the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_03
 And what function, working design, how does it work.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_03
 So these are the two things we should come up with.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_03
 So the first thing is maybe a little easier on who is our target group.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_03
 I guess in many ways everybody.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_03
 Everybody who has a TV.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_02
 TV television, yes.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_03
 And I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a TV.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_03
 They are a few, but in general not.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_03
 Now, talking about the target group, which is in a sense everybody, but I think within the target group we have subgroups.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_03
 We have earlier it was mentioned about, for example, elderly people who have limited function with their fingers in hands.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_03
 So I think that's one group that's certainly important.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_03
 Then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it's really very clear.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_03
 And I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_03
 I mean that's a question.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_03
 Whether that's important that children can really use it or not.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_03
 So these are just some thoughts I have on it.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_03
 And I don't know what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're going to design this one thing.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_03
 Or whether we're looking at what we like, we're talking about different shapes.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_03
 Whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_04
 Well, you know there's the old motto, children under six never shop alone.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_04
 So if you design something that's very attractive to children, the mommy please mommy please.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_04
 You know we want it now, we want to go to the store and see it.

0:27:58	SPEAKER_04
 That has a lot of marketing pull.

0:28:01	SPEAKER_03
 That has a lot of appeal but I think I'm talking about the functionality now on it.

0:28:07	SPEAKER_03
 Whether we're looking at different groups.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_03
 Children's issue can be addressed with the shape and with colors.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_03
 That's right.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_03
 You know like you make it nice and pink, fluorescent, banana, color or whatever.

0:28:18	SPEAKER_03
 You can make a banana shaped one.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, for example, you know.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_03
 But the question is really who is our target group?

0:28:26	SPEAKER_03
 Do we look at one target group and with the 25 euros, you know, can we can we afford to have I'm asking the technical people here whether.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_03
 To look at the sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_03
 How much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_03
 Respect.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_02
 Generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with age from 10 to 40.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_02
 And then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people with.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_02
 With.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_02
 With.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_02
 Who have nervous problems.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe we can design different remotes for different people.

0:29:20	SPEAKER_01
 Like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know.

0:29:23	SPEAKER_02
 Well that's.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_02
 In a family there will be a aged person, children and a middle age.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_02
 But they cannot buy three different remotes.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_02
 They would like to buy just one and just one which can be used by all the three.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_01
 Or that we can do but specifically if like elderly people want a big buttons then you can't really make a big remote controller.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe specifically you can design a big remote controller elderly and for children.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_04
 What about the electronics that's not really going to change much.

0:29:53	SPEAKER_02
 It doesn't cost.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_04
 No that will that won't change much will it.

0:29:57	SPEAKER_03
 The question to be addressed here is only who is a target group and how will it function.

0:30:04	SPEAKER_03
 And I think how will it function is probably the question of the buttons.

0:30:09	SPEAKER_03
 You know.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_03
 Within the target group or subgroups.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_03
 The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_03
 I mean the basic design I understand will be the same but the question is how much will that set us back if they say.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_03
 40% we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example.

0:30:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_03
 So that remains to be seen but target group as a whole is basically everybody with a TV.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_03
 That's right.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_04
 And can we can we is it even feasible to make one remote control with something for everyone.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_04
 Or we have to try to use the same electronics and make three different shapes.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah well that's that's the question.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_04
 The same electronics and basically all that's going to be different is the plastic case.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_04
 And in that case we could probably molded plastic isn't all that expensive is it.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_04
 Here is an industrial person.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_03
 Well maybe there's there's an idea you know the new for example new portable phones.

0:31:14	SPEAKER_03
 They have like removable plastic cases.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_03
 So you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one or whatever.

0:31:23	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe something like that that in each package you know you have.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_03
 There's a real idea.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_03
 You have you have for example you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_03
 But then you have another color or stripe whatever that already comes in a package.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_03
 And then if people really want more colors they can buy it separately.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_01
 Like mobile phones we have different you know covers.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_03
 That's right and but like if then everybody is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the stripe to whatever they have as another one in the package then they can go to the store and for a few Frank's or euros whatever they can buy an alternate package.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_03
 An alternate package with another two colors in it you know for example.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_02
 But yeah I have a doubt like will it be cause twice effective if we if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_03
 Well I think I think the idea here is to design one remote.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_03
 And what the only change is going to be the functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_03
 Having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_03
 Either for children.

0:32:50	SPEAKER_03
 Five minutes I guess that's the old message.

0:32:56	None
 Morning.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_03
 Finish me now.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_03
 Well we may have to come back to our next meeting.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_03
 But I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_03
 If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_03
 Do we agree on that in principle like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_03
 So now I understand it's lunch break.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_00
 So thank you very much.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_00
 And we'll see you after lunch.
