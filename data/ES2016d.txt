 o This is our last meeting.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_02
 I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting.

0:00:39	SPEAKER_02
 And then we'll have the prototype presentation.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_02
 Then we will do an evaluation.

0:00:51	SPEAKER_02
 We'll see what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_02
 Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_02
 Then we'll do the evaluation and then we can finish up after that with changes that we'll need to make.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_02
 Or hopefully everything will fall right in line.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_02
 See minutes from the last meeting.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_02
 We looked at the trends.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_02
 We had the fashion trends that people want to fancy look and feel.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_02
 It was twice as important as anything else.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_02
 They liked fruit and vegetables and the new styles.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_02
 And a spongy feel.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_02
 So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_02
 They wanted limited buttons and simplicity.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_02
 Then we looked at the method for coming up with our own remote.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_02
 Looking at other devices.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_02
 The iPod.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_02
 We really like to look at that.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_02
 We also had the kids remote for a simple idea.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_02
 A two part remote, which was what we were originally looking at.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_02
 And then there was talk of speech recognition becoming more predominant and easier to use.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_02
 But I think we still decided not to go with that.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_02
 Then we looked at the components.

0:02:27	SPEAKER_02
 The materials for the case, the different energy sources, the different types of chips.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_02
 And made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_02
 And basically.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_02
 How what we were making for the prototype.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_02
 So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_02
 Take over.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_02
 The prototype.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, do you need this?

0:03:03	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_04
 There he is.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_04
 I'll have a blog about it.

0:03:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, basically we went with the color yellow.

0:03:15	SPEAKER_04
 Working on the principle of a fruit, which was mentioned, basically designed around a banana.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_04
 But it would be held in such a fashion.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_04
 Whereas obviously it wouldn't be that floppy because this would be hard plastic.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_04
 These would be like the rubber, the rubber grips.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_04
 So that's how helpful the hell we grip.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_04
 The ergonomics would be done with this scroll wheel.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_04
 And this here represents the screen where you'd go through.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_04
 And the simplest function would be almost identical to an iPod.

0:03:53	SPEAKER_04
 And that one way through channels, that way with other way through channels.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_04
 Volume up and down.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_04
 And then to access the more complicated functions.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_04
 So you press that and go through the menus.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_04
 It's that simple.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_04
 That's just represents the infrared beam.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_04
 That's a simple or an off switch.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know we could use the voice.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_04
 That blue bit should be yellow.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_04
 That would be where the batteries would be.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_04
 And that's about it.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_04
 It's a simple.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_04
 We can make it.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_04
 Is anything else?

0:04:25	SPEAKER_03
 That's what we have.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_03
 That's plastic.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_03
 Plastic covered with rubber.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_03
 We might add some more underneath here.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe give it a form.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_03
 I mean we're supposed to hold it like that.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_03
 But she grabbed it.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's just made.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_03
 It's definitely just rough.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_03
 Left hand in order.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_03
 And they just both.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_03
 Exactly.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_03
 These both might as well.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_03
 The actual thing might be smaller.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_03
 Think about the bottom.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_03
 Either put either one on either side.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_03
 Not too at all.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_03
 Just a quick on-off button.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_03
 That's pretty important.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_03
 So you don't have to fit over that.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:05:08	SPEAKER_03
 That's not.

0:05:10	SPEAKER_03
 I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:05:15	SPEAKER_03
 Play with that over there.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_04
 Nice flimsy because it's made out of heavy.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_04
 Do you like to?

0:05:21	SPEAKER_01
 Well done.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_02
 Kind of a banana.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_04
 No, whether or not it would fall into the costume and everything I suppose.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_04
 Would they scroll and they all see the.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_02
 Well, luckily we are going to find out.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_02
 Or not luckily.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_02
 Do you have a marketing.

0:05:46	SPEAKER_01
 I do presentation for us.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_01
 So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_01
 That I found just based on the past.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_01
 Turn the reports that I was looking at earlier.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_01
 And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_01
 And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did.

0:06:35	SPEAKER_01
 So the criteria we're going to be looking at.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_01
 Are the complaints.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_01
 That we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier.

0:06:45	SPEAKER_01
 So.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_01
 We're going to be doing it based on a seven point scale.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_01
 And one is going to mean true that we did actually achieve that.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_01
 With seven being false we did not achieve that.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_01
 So for the first one we need to decide did we solve the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's definitely different than anything else out there.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_02
 So if they think that what is out there is ugly then yes.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_02
 I would say most definitely it's bright.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_02
 But still has your traditional black.

0:07:47	None
 It's curved.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_02
 There's no sharp angles to it.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_03
 Not angular.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_03
 It comes to the ergonomics, the form and stuff.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, that's definitely more beautiful than your average.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_03
 However the color.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have to say in that.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_03
 We have to say that we have to say that we have to solve the problem completely.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_03
 Because the color is ugly.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_03
 There's nothing you can say about that.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_03
 I much prefer something like brushed chrome.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_03
 That form.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_02
 Something more modern to go.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_02
 A modern color to go with the modern form.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_02
 But it's different.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_03
 You don't want your three feet huge LCD display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_01
 So do you think since we this wasn't assigned criteria?

0:08:51	SPEAKER_01
 Do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle of them?

0:08:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_01
 What do you think?

0:08:58	SPEAKER_02
 Three, four.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_02
 Four.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_02
 Four.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_02
 Very non-committal four.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_01
 The second one.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_01
 Did we make it simple for new users?

0:09:13	SPEAKER_03
 It's very intuitive.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_03
 I think.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_04
 That was the main name.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_04
 The main names that we had.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_03
 One.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_03
 One?

0:09:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_01
 Do the controls now match the operating behavior of the users?

0:09:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_04
 We brought it down to basically four controls where they did the most common channel and volume.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_04
 And then the other one was just a matter of just going further.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_02
 Just scrolling through and selecting.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_00
 So one?

0:09:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's a one.

0:09:51	None
 Okay.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_01
 The fourth one.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_01
 How about the problem of a remote being easily lost?

0:10:03	SPEAKER_01
 One of the number one.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_03
 Something that big and that yellow you just don't know.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_03
 What do you want to know?

0:10:09	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to lose.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_04
 But if we were to, if we were that speech recognition that we could maybe just use that solely for the finding thing.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_04
 That was what we mentioned.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_02
 So if we incorporate speech recognition into it, then just to use to find it.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_04
 If it was lost, but like I said, you lose something so yellow so easily.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_04
 And it's not going to fall like a rectangle.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_04
 Slick down behind things.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_04
 That's going to be a difficult shape.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it is quite bright.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe in the middle again, three or four or something.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, you know, losing things is one of those things that people can lose.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, a million ways you can pick it up and walk away with it and then you lost it.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_02
 But if we do go with the with the speech recognition, then it, then our scale goes up quite a bit.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_02
 Probably probably two.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_02
 You know, if we eliminate the fact that, you know, it's impossible to guarantee that it's not going to be lost.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_02
 Let's say two.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_02
 With speech recognition, which of course may be changed depending on budget.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_03
 So we could add an extra feature actually, which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from television.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_03
 We could add that, but that's nothing we have thought of.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_02
 Which, which may be cheaper than speech recognition.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_02
 It would just stay.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, true.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_04
 But I mean, just those whistling clappens, cravings, you have that shape.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_04
 So I can't be that.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_04
 And the space on this anti anti-thas Sort of proximity.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_03
 Or suitcases and stuff where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage, another piece that starts beeping that can't cost much.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_03
 So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to hide.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_03
 So you have one piece, you have to glue somewhere behind your TV.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_02
 Stick it behind your TV and the other.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_02
 I'm afraid that you don't accidentally lose that piece.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_02
 That'd be tough.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_03
 Well, also your remote would alarm you if somebody stole your TV to your television.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_03
 Ran off of that without taking the beautiful remote control.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_01
 So, are we adding one of these two features?

0:12:25	SPEAKER_01
 Let's add one of those features and say yes.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 So we're back to a one.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_01
 Or two.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_01
 Two.

0:12:32	None
 Two.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_01
 Are we technologically innovative?

0:12:39	SPEAKER_04
 I'd say so.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_04
 I don't get my name up.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_04
 It's all just souls with screen.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_04
 It's all just stolen.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_02
 But there's not a lot of yellow.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_02
 There's not a lot of yellow.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_02
 Of course I wasn't really forced to take that color.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 Two.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know the way you are that innovative.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_02
 It's too true.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_01
 But how many robots do you see like this?

0:13:06	SPEAKER_02
 If we added the screaming factor.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_02
 Then we go up.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_02
 I would say we're probably up four.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 Really?

0:13:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_01
 It's going to hurt us.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_01
 Spongy material.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we do have that.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_03
 We have some splashes.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's native.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:13:29	SPEAKER_03
 It's not a one though.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_03
 One would be the whole thing.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, because it's only got to fold and stuff.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_02
 Like these parts of the grips and perhaps the back side, the bottom underneath on the back.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_03
 So lots of four.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_02
 Probably four at most.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_01
 Lastly, did we put the fashion in electronics?

0:13:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_02
 Your fashion is but is Carmen Miranda?

0:13:59	SPEAKER_02
 You betcha.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the recent fashion is rather displayed in the LCD.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_03
 It's true.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_03
 And you operated the form on the color, but it definitely is.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_04
 What we were told.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_04
 Definitely.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_01
 Now I just got to calculate.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_01
 17.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_01
 17.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_01
 17.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_01
 17.

0:14:28	SPEAKER_04
 17.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_01
 Jesus and Amas, You bet whistlebl Right? How does that work?

0:15:00	SPEAKER_03
 I'm impressed I can't do that without a calculator.

0:15:02	SPEAKER_03
 No, I'm fine.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_01
 It's been a while.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_02
 And what is the acceptable criteria?

0:15:15	SPEAKER_02
 Is there like a scale that we have to hit?

0:15:17	SPEAKER_01
 Oh no, I just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_01
 Basically.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_02
 All right then.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_01
 So that's that.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, well, let's see.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_02
 Now we get to do the budget numbers.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_02
 You didn't know that you were going to have a budget.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_02
 But we do.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_04
 It's been going a long time.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_04
 It's 2.4 to 8.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_04
 I said it was too strong.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_04
 Oh my gosh.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_04
 2.4 to 8.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, we're going to have that.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_02
 So I have here 50% be pretty.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_02
 We want a 50% profit on this.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_02
 I can't really see that very well.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_02
 Just about finished quickly.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_02
 12 and a half euros is what's supposed to cost us.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 It's too much.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_02
 Well, let's see.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_02
 The.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_02
 This.

0:16:28	None
 Okay.

0:16:30	None
 All right.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_02
 All right, so.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if you guys can read that enough.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_02
 I can't sit on my glasses on.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_02
 But so we've got the energy source.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_02
 There's a four, five, six categories.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_02
 We have energy source electronics case.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_02
 Then we have case material supplements interface type.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_02
 And then button supplements.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_02
 First of all, energy source.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_02
 We pick battery.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_02
 And how many batteries do we think this will probably take?

0:17:23	SPEAKER_02
 Probably.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_02
 So either two or four.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_02
 Two.

0:17:28	None
 Two.

0:17:29	None
 Like it.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_03
 Four is going to be too heavy.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_03
 So that's not our problem.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_03
 People can change it every month.

0:17:37	None
 They won't.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I thought I thought I bought it.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_02
 This is consumerism.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_02
 So for the electronics, our choices are simple chip on print, regular chip on print, advanced chip on print, sample sensor, sample speaker.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_03
 Advanced chip, that's the advanced chip on print.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_02
 We have one of those.

0:18:03	None
 Okay.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_02
 Then the case is a.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_02
 Probably that's double curved.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_02
 Case materials are.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_02
 Plastic.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_02
 Plastic.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_02
 I guess it's two since one for the top one for the bottom.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_02
 Is that right or is it just one?

0:18:28	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, maybe it's one because of the.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_03
 It's just one single mode.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_02
 I guess it doesn't matter because the price on that one is zero.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_02
 Special color.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_03
 That's not a special color.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_02
 Especially ugly color.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_02
 Interface type.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_02
 We have push button scroll wheel interface.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_02
 Integrated scroll wheel push button LCD display.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_02
 So we actually have the LCD display.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_02
 And then is it the integrated or.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_04
 Absolutely.

0:19:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 Button supplement special color.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_02
 Special form.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_02
 Special material.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_03
 We could of course make the buttons would.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_03
 Same how can they.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_01
 Really love or titanium.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
 The cost is all.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_02
 But we only have one button.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_02
 So really we shouldn't be charged.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_02
 We shouldn't be charged anything.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_02
 The button supplements.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_02
 We're going to leave that one blank because we run on a LCD.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_02
 Scroll.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_02
 So our total is 15.5.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_02
 Which I believe.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_02
 Is.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_02
 Three euros over.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_03
 So we go for the hand.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_02
 So the only thing better than a banana shape remote is one of the.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_02
 One that you shake.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_04
 What if we completely took out the one single button we've got on.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_04
 And just had a scroll wheel interface.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_04
 And the LCD's way.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_04
 I suppose the LCD's way is the one that's putting it off a bit.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_02
 Well, because we have to have both, right?

0:20:33	SPEAKER_03
 That's a basic.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_03
 It also depends on the software on the television you can have.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_04
 The information that's been translated on the screen.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_02
 You could maybe take out the LCD's.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_03
 If it comes up on the computer itself, on the TV itself.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_03
 And you're not needed.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_03
 There you go.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_02
 There we go.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_02
 There we go.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_02
 Twelve point five.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_02
 So we just remove our screen here.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_04
 Big a dial.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_04
 Easy to use.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_04
 Easy to use on.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_02
 Besides, look at what the LCD does to our lovely remote.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_02
 Back to the design room, boys.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_03
 Take away a heck of water.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_01
 What's the blue part?

0:21:38	SPEAKER_04
 That was just, we ran out of yellow.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_03
 There you go.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_04
 There you go.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_01
 It was simpler.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_04
 Looks more like a banana.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_04
 Feels a few little bit out there.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_02
 Cost under twelve point five zero.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_02
 We redesigned it.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_02
 Now it's yes.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_02
 Next slide.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_02
 Project evaluation.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_02
 Project process satisfaction with, for example.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_02
 Creativity leadership team work means new ideas found.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_02
 So I guess that.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_02
 I think that perhaps the project evaluation is just supposed to be complete by me.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_02
 But I'd like to hear your thoughts.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_01
 What did you think of our project process?

0:22:59	SPEAKER_02
 We don't quite well.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_04
 Team work.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_03
 Right from the start of the day.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_02
 We started off a little week.

0:23:28	SPEAKER_02
 Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 But as the day went along, we had more idea of what we were doing.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_02
 Room for creativity.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_02
 I think it was interesting as you guys brought up more information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_02
 You guys work together.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_02
 Well team.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_02
 And the means.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_02
 Which was the white board depends.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_02
 I had some problem with the pen.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_01
 I think.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_01
 Minus your power point.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_01
 Minus your power point.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_03
 My father.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_03
 No, I know.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_02
 People I worked for.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_02
 Have a list of employees that you would like fired.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_02
 For the remote.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe no.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_02
 For technology.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_02
 Closing.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_02
 Cost or within the budget.

0:24:41	SPEAKER_02
 Project is evaluated.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_02
 Complete final questionnaire and meeting someone.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_02
 That's it.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_02
 I still have to do my minutes.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_02
 So there will probably be another.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_02
 Question air coming up.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_02
 And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_02
 What goes on after that.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_02
 That's the end of our meeting.
