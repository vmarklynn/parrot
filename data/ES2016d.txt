0:00:00	None
 best yes

0:00:19	None
 yes Okay, this is our last meeting.

0:00:35	SPEAKER_02
 I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting and then we'll have a prototype presentation.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_02
 Then we will do an evaluation or we'll see what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation.

0:00:57	SPEAKER_02
 Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget.

0:01:03	SPEAKER_02
 Then we'll do the evaluation and then we can finish up after that with the changes that we'll need to make or hopefully everything will fall right in line.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_02
 The minutes from the last meeting, we looked at the trends.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_02
 We had the fashion trends that people want a fancy look and feel.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_02
 It was twice as important as anything else.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_02
 They liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles and a spongy feel.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_02
 So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_02
 They wanted limited buttons and simplicity.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_02
 Then we looked at the method for coming up with our own remote, looking at other devices, the iPod.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_02
 We really liked to look at that.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_02
 We also had the kids remote for a simple idea, a two-part remote, which was what we originally looking at.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_02
 Then there was tacos.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_02
 Speech recognition becoming more predominant and easier to use.

0:02:28	SPEAKER_02
 But I think we still decided not to go with that.

0:02:31	SPEAKER_02
 Then we looked at the components, the materials for the case, the different energy sources, different types of chips and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_02
 And basically, what we were making for the prototype.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_02
 So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_04
 The prototype.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_04
 The prototype.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, do you need this?

0:03:03	SPEAKER_04
 No.

0:03:04	SPEAKER_04
 There you go.

0:03:11	SPEAKER_04
 Basically, we went with the colour yellow.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_04
 We were working on the principle of fruit, which was mentioned, it's basically designed around a banana.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_04
 But it would be held in such a fashion where it is, obviously, it wouldn't be that floppy because this would be hard plastic.

0:03:29	SPEAKER_04
 These would be like the rubber grips.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_04
 So that's how hopefully we grip the ergonomics of it.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_04
 But all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_04
 To use your imagination, it's a bit.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_04
 And this here represents the screen where you'd go through.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_04
 And the simplest functions would be almost identical to an iPod, but that won't work through channels, that with other ethos, the volume would up and down.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_04
 And then to access the more complicated functions, you press that and go through the menus.

0:04:03	SPEAKER_04
 That's simple.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_04
 That's just representally infrared beam.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_04
 That's a simple analog switch.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_04
 We could use the voice.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_04
 That blue bits should be yellow.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_04
 That'd be where the vouchers would be, I suppose.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_04
 And that's about it.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_04
 This is simple.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_04
 We can make it.

0:04:24	SPEAKER_03
 We have a plastic covered with rubber.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_03
 We might add some more underneath here.

0:04:35	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe give it a form.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_03
 I'm supposed to hold them like that, but just if you grab it.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's my best.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_03
 Definitely she would.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, left handed over.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_03
 And they're supposed exactly, you know, you might as well.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think that might be smaller.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_03
 Think about the buttons.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, either one on either side.

0:04:58	SPEAKER_02
 But not doing it all.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_03
 Just a quick one off button.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think it's pretty important.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_03
 So you don't have to fiddle with that.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_03
 That's that.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_03
 I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_03
 You're going to play with that over there.

0:05:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_04
 Nice flimsy because it's straight up heavy.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_04
 Just like that.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_01
 I'm happy.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_02
 Well done.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_01
 Kind of a banana.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_04
 No, whether or not it would fall to the cost of everything I suppose.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_04
 Would they scroll and they all say they?

0:05:36	SPEAKER_02
 Well, luckily we are going to find out.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_02
 Or not likely.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_02
 Do you have a marketing presentation for us?

0:05:51	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_01
 You guys are going to help me do an evaluation of the criteria.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_01
 So first, I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_01
 And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_01
 And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_01
 So the criteria we're going to be looking at are the complaints that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_01
 So we're going to be doing it based on a 7 point scale.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_01
 And one is going to mean true that we did actually achieve that 7 being false we did not achieve that.

0:07:21	SPEAKER_01
 So for the first one, we need to decide did we solve the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote?

0:07:32	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's definitely different than anything else out there.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_02
 So if they think that what is out there is ugly, then yes.

0:07:39	SPEAKER_02
 I would say most definitely.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_02
 It's bright.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_02
 It's bright.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_02
 It still has your traditional black.

0:07:44	SPEAKER_02
 It's curved.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_04
 It's no shop.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_02
 Angles to it.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_02
 Not angular.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_03
 I'd say it comes to the ergonomics of form and stuff.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, that's definitely more beautiful than your average.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_03
 However, the color.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_01
 I think color is the track to us.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_03
 So that has been dictated pretty much by the company.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_03
 So to answer that, honestly, I would rather say we have not solved the problem completely in the remote because the color is ugly.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_03
 Definitely.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_03
 It's nothing you can say about that.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_03
 I much prefer something like brushed chrome.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_03
 That form.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, something more modern to go.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_02
 A modern color to go with the modern form.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_03
 It's different.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_03
 You don't want your three feet huge LCD display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with someone like that.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_01
 OK, so do you think since we, this wasn't a sign criteria, do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle of them?

0:08:54	SPEAKER_01
 Is that something good?

0:08:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 What do you think?

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 Three, four.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_02
 I would say four.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_02
 Four is there.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_02
 Very non-committal for.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_01
 The second one, did we make it simple for new users?

0:09:14	SPEAKER_03
 It's very intuitive.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_04
 So that was the main name.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_04
 My name is what we had.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_03
 Do the one.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_03
 One?

0:09:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_01
 And do the controls now match the operating behavior of the users?

0:09:32	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_04
 Because we've brought it down to basically four controls where they did the most common, which are channel and volume.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_04
 And then the other one was just a massive, just going further.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_04
 Just scrolling further.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_02
 Just scrolling through and selecting.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_00
 So one.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_00
 So that's one.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's one.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:09:51	None
 OK.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 The fourth one, how about the problem of a remote being easily lost, one of the number ones?

0:10:04	SPEAKER_03
 I think that big and that yellow you just saw.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_03
 What did you like to do in the bright end?

0:10:10	SPEAKER_04
 But if we were to, if we were to, the speech recognition, we could maybe just use that solely for the finding thing.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_04
 That was what we would manage.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_02
 So if we incorporate speech recognition into it,

0:10:22	SPEAKER_04
 then just use to find it when it was lost. But like I said, I don't know.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_04
 You'd lose something and say, yellow, so easily.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_04
 And it's not going to fall like a rectangle, slip down behind things.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_04
 That's going to be a difficult shape to.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_02
 It is quite bright.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe in the middle again, three or four.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, losing things is one of those things that people can lose.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, in a million ways, you can pick it up or walk away with it.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_04
 And then you lost it.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_02
 But if we do go with the speech recognition, then our scale goes up quite a bit.

0:10:54	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_02
 Probably two.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_02
 If we eliminate the fact that it's impossible to guarantee that it's not going to be lost then.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_02
 Let's say two with speech recognition, which, of course, may be changed depending on budget.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_03
 You could add an extra feature, actually, which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from television.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_03
 We could add that, but that's nothing we have thought of, which

0:11:33	SPEAKER_02
 may be cheaper than speech recognition, if it were just a, yeah, true.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_04
 But I mean, just as whistling clapping and screaming, you have that shape.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_04
 So I can't be that.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_03
 It's based on this anti-entie thousand sort of technology.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_03
 They are suitcases and stuff where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage, another piece that starts beeping that can't cost much.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_03
 So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to hide so you have one piece.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_03
 You have to glue somewhere behind your TV.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_02
 You stick it behind your TV and the other.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_02
 Pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_03
 That'd be tough, though.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_03
 Well, also your remote would alarm you if somebody stole your TV to your television.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_03
 And then you can run off to that without taking the beautiful remote control.

0:12:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_01
 So are we adding one of these two features?

0:12:24	SPEAKER_01
 Let's add one of those features and say yes.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_01
 So we're going back to a one or two.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_01
 Two.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_01
 Are we technologically innovative?

0:12:36	SPEAKER_04
 I just want to show.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_04
 I don't get my name up.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know what the controls was.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_04
 Just screened on.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_04
 It's all just stolen.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_02
 I thought it was.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_02
 But there's not a lot of yellow.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_02
 There's not a lot of yellow.

0:12:52	SPEAKER_02
 Of course, I wasn't really.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_02
 You're kind of forced to take that color.

0:12:56	None
 Two.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know the way we are that innovative.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_01
 No, not true.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_01
 But how many remote steers do you like this?

0:13:06	SPEAKER_02
 If we added the screaming factor.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_02
 And we go up.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_02
 I would say we're probably up for.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 Really?

0:13:17	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_01
 It's going to hurt us.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_01
 Spungy material.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we have that.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_01
 We have some splashes.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_03
 We have some splashes sort of made you.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_03
 It's not a one though.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_03
 One would be the whole thing.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_02
 Because it's only got to fold.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's a good thing.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_03
 And then we have some splashes.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_03
 These parts of the grips and perhaps the backside.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_02
 The bottom underneath on the back.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_01
 So that's a four.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_01
 Probably a four at most.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_01
 And lastly.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_01
 Did we put the fashion in electronics?

0:13:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_02
 If your fashion is but is Carmen Miranda?

0:13:59	SPEAKER_02
 You betcha.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_03
 Well, the recent fashion has rather displayed in the LCD and the way you operate it.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the form on the color, but it definitely is.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_03
 This is what we were told.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_04
 Let's say, definitely.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_01
 Now I just got a calculator.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_01
 17, the baddest.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_01
 What's your baddest?

0:14:29	SPEAKER_04
 17.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_02
 Seven is.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_02
 Two point.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_02
 Four.

0:14:36	None
 Two point.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_02
 Four.

0:14:42	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I've been done math.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_01
 What?

0:14:48	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sure you can't wait.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, we'll say 2.42.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_01
 How's that work?

0:14:57	SPEAKER_03
 Press, I can't do that without a calculator.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_03
 It's been a while.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_02
 And what is the acceptable criteria?

0:15:15	SPEAKER_02
 Is there like a scale that we have to hit?

0:15:18	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, no.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_01
 It just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it?

0:15:24	SPEAKER_01
 Basically.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_02
 All right, then.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_01
 So that's that.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, well, let's see.

0:15:39	SPEAKER_02
 Now we get to do the budget numbers.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_02
 You didn't know that you were going to have a budget.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_02
 But we do.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_04
 It's been going a long time.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not 2.42.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_01
 I said, you just keep skydiving.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_02
 So I have here 50%.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_02
 We want a 50% profit on this.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_02
 I can't really see that very well.

0:16:16	SPEAKER_02
 12.5 euros is what's the cost.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_02
 So it's too much.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_02
 Well, let's see.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_02
 I like this.

0:16:28	None
 Okay.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_02
 So the top.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if you guys can read that enough.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_02
 I can't sit on my glasses on.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_02
 So we've got the energy source.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_02
 There's a four five six categories.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_02
 We have energy source, electronics, case.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_02
 Then we have case material supplements, interface type.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_02
 And then button supplements.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_02
 So first of all, energy source.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_02
 We pick battery.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_02
 Probably some either two or four.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_02
 Two.

0:17:28	None
 Two.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_03
 Like it.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_03
 Four is going to be too heavy.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_03
 So that's not our problem.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_03
 People can change it every month.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_03
 They won't go on.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_02
 Excellent.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_02
 They bought it.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_02
 This is consumerism.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_02
 So for the electronics, our choices are simple chip on print, regular chip on print, advanced chip on print, sample sensor, sample speaker.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_03
 That's the advanced chip on print.

0:18:00	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_02
 We have one of those.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_02
 Then the case is a probably it's double curved.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_02
 So the case materials are plastic, plastic.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_02
 I guess it's two since one for the top one for the bottom.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_02
 Is that right or is it just one?

0:18:29	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it's one because of the single mode.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_02
 I guess it doesn't matter because the price on that one is zero.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_02
 Special color.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_03
 That's not a special color.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_02
 The ugly color.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_02
 Interface type.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_02
 We have push buttons, scroll wheel interface, integrated scroll wheel push button, LCD display.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_02
 So we actually have the LCD display.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_04
 And then is it the integrated or?

0:19:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_02
 Button supplements.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_02
 Special color.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_02
 Special form.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_02
 Special material.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_03
 We could of course make the buttons wood.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_03
 Same.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_01
 How can they?

0:19:25	SPEAKER_01
 Really love that?

0:19:26	SPEAKER_01
 Or titanium.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_01
 The cost is all the same.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_02
 But we only have one button.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_02
 So really we shouldn't be sure.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_02
 We shouldn't be sure.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_02
 Anything.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_02
 The button supplements.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_04
 I think no.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_02
 We're going to leave that one blank because we run on LCD and scroll.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_02
 So our total is 15.5.

0:19:51	SPEAKER_02
 Which I believe is by three euros over.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_03
 So we go for the hand dynamo.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 So the only thing better than if a Nana's shape remote is one that you shake.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_04
 What if we complete and took out the one single button we've got on and just had a scroll wheel interface.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_04
 And the LCD display.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_04
 I suppose the LCD display is the one that's putting out.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_02
 Well, because we have to have both, right?

0:20:32	None
 Yeah.

0:20:33	SPEAKER_03
 And that's that's face it also depends on the software on the television.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_03
 You can have the information of this.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_03
 Display on the screen.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you could maybe take out the LCD display.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_04
 Even if it comes up on the computer itself on TV itself.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_02
 So we may not need the LCD display.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_04
 Not as possible.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_03
 There you go.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_03
 There we go.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_02
 12.5.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_02
 So we just remove our screen screen here.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_04
 Big a dial.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_04
 Easy to use.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_04
 Even easy to use.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_02
 Besides, look at what the LCD does to our lovely remote.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_02
 Back to the design room, boys.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_03
 Take away.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_03
 There you go.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_01
 What's the blue part?

0:21:39	SPEAKER_00
 That was just we got out of yellow.

0:21:44	SPEAKER_04
 There you go.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_04
 There you go.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_01
 Even simpler.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_04
 Looks more like a banana.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_02
 So costs under 12.5 euro.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_02
 There's no.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_02
 We redesigned it.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:02	SPEAKER_02
 Now it's yes.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_02
 Next slide.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_02
 Project evaluation.

0:22:07	SPEAKER_02
 Project process satisfaction with, for example, room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, means, new ideas found.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_02
 So I guess that, let's see.

0:22:28	SPEAKER_02
 I think that perhaps the project evaluation is just supposed to be completed by me.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_02
 But I'd like to hear your thoughts.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_01
 Kind of fill in some time.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_02
 What did you think of our project process?

0:23:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think we don't quite well.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_04
 We started off a little week.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_02
 Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_02
 But as the day went along, we had more idea of what we were doing.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 Room for creativity.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_02
 There was that.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_02
 I think we tried a lot of different things.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_02
 And I think it was interesting as you guys brought up more information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_02
 You guys worked together.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_02
 Well, as a team.

0:23:57	SPEAKER_02
 And the means.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_02
 Which was the whiteboard and the pens.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_02
 I had some problem with the pen.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_01
 I think my power point.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_01
 No, I know.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_03
 People I work for.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_02
 I have a list of employees that you would like fired.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_02
 New ideas found.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, for the remote, maybe no, not for technology.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_02
 Closing, cost are within the budget.

0:24:39	SPEAKER_02
 Project is evaluated.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_02
 Complete final questionnaire and meeting someone.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_02
 That's it.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_02
 I still have to do my minutes.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_02
 Actually.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_02
 So there will probably be another questionnaire coming up.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_02
 And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can.

0:25:13	SPEAKER_02
 What goes on after that.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_02
 That's the end of our meeting.

0:25:22	None
 Nancy.

0:25:28	None
 Tyler.

0:25:43	None
 Jeff.
