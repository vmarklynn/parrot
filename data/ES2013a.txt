0:00:00	None
 C Oh, it's not liking us.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_03
 It went that way.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_03
 Computer adjusting.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_02
 architect.

0:01:08	None
 Okay, so.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:24	None
 There you go.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_03
 You ready back there?

0:01:41	None
 Okay.

0:01:43	SPEAKER_03
 Welcome, everyone.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_03
 This is the kickoff meeting for the day.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_03
 We're the new group to create a new remote control for real reaction.

0:02:01	SPEAKER_03
 As you can see, our agenda is to open up the meeting, become acquainted with each other, have a little training on tools, create a plan, discuss things, and we only have 25 minutes total.

0:02:17	None
 Okay.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_03
 The new remote control is to be original, trendy, and user friendly.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_03
 That stuff is your part as the user friendliness.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_03
 The originality is going to take all of us.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_03
 The trendiness will probably give us some marketing research information from you, Sarah.

0:02:42	SPEAKER_03
 And we'll get on with it.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_03
 We have a functional design, individual work, both meeting and then conceptual design and then detailed design.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_03
 Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_03
 Kate, why don't you try it first if you can either bring your things with you, I guess.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_03
 And while you're doing that, we'll try and figure out how to put these things on as well.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_03
 It's raw, good.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to walk around.

0:03:20	None
 Right.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_02
 So you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_02
 Do you have to be able to recognize what animal it is?

0:03:38	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's just to try out the whiteboard.

0:03:45	SPEAKER_01
 Are we all going to draw a cat?

0:03:53	SPEAKER_01
 I know.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_02
 Only animal I could think of as a girl.

0:03:59	None
 Aww.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_02
 This is sort of funny rabbit cat.

0:04:05	SPEAKER_02
 You can do it, it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_02
 It should have a mouth as well.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_02
 Great.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_02
 And the characteristics.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_02
 The characteristics of the cat, the whiskers I think because they're the easiest to draw.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_02
 Ah, I'll give it some more.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:04:29	None
 A tail.

0:04:30	None
 Fantastic.

0:04:31	SPEAKER_03
 Since you're handy as well when you do yours next stuff.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's used to using the pen and the pencil.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sure you thought to test all artistic.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_02
 But no.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's a mouse.

0:05:00	SPEAKER_02
 It's not a mouse, you know.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_02
 It's a wombat.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_01
 So, arty.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_02
 A what?

0:05:18	SPEAKER_03
 A rat.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_03
 A mouse, a rat.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 It's not as close.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_01
 A rat you hurt with a very long tail.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_03
 And your favorite characteristics of that animal.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_01
 Dead intelligent and the cheeky and fantastic pets.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, very friendly.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_01
 And they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_00
 Thanks.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, a fish.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_02
 Gosh, what?

0:06:23	SPEAKER_02
 I think a fish that's even easier to draw than cat.

0:06:28	SPEAKER_00
 This is very representational.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_00
 Fine.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_00
 I like them because they're sleek and they have a lot of freedom, but they also do swimming groups.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_00
 So, you have a favorite one.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_03
 I'm afraid I'm with Steph.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think you're pen running out of whatever.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_03
 But I'm afraid I take the cowards way out and the cat's looking the other way.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_03
 He's hiding.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_03
 Cats are sometimes very independent.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_03
 My parents had cats and they can decide for themselves what is best.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we have to get down to the nitty gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_03
 We're to sell it for 25 euros with a profit aim, ultimately, of 50 million euros.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_03
 That tells you something about how many we have to sell on an international scale.

0:08:03	SPEAKER_03
 We'd be awful lot of these.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_03
 We'd be like 100 million of them to make 25 euros on each one and make a total profit of 50 million.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_03
 The production is to only cost 12 and a half euros per item.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_03
 Now, if they cost 12 and a half, you're selling it for 25, you're making 12 and a half euros each.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_03
 And we're to make a profit of 50 million.

0:08:34	SPEAKER_03
 That's just, can you do the maths and how many are we selling?

0:08:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_00
 I was just wondering if that's the 50% is normal markup.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_00
 I would think we'd be more like 60%.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_00
 I have two thoughts.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_00
 And your question is how many do we have to sell?

0:09:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, because our market is international and your problem has to do with marketing of, you know, you've got to know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have target and who is that.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_03
 That's to give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_03
 So that's 4 million.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_03
 Something like that.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_03
 That's 50 million euros.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_03
 50 million euros and you're only getting 12 and a half each.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_03
 That's a lot of selling.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_03
 To be 50 before million.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_03
 You have to sell 4 million.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_03
 Experience with the remote control.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_03
 And if you use a remote control for television or DVD or something.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_03
 We're both nodding.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_02
 We're talking about one that will work for the home environment.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_03
 Well, I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_03
 But I also have heard about them not working well or not well coordinated and you wind up working with this one for this this three and then this one over here for another.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_01
 You're sitting on your sofa and you want to change something but it's five different.

0:10:37	SPEAKER_01
 It's a one for the TV team.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_01
 One for the video and one for cable and one for.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_01
 They don't always talk to each other.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_01
 I presume this is just for television.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_01
 Don't know.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. Are there any ideas for the remote?

0:10:54	SPEAKER_03
 What would it be for and what group would be before?

0:11:00	SPEAKER_03
 We have to think about that one.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_00
 We could make a Hello Kitty.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_00
 Fame.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_01
 I think one of the great colors.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_00
 We could totally go to Japan.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, there's also the cache that the Japanese make great products.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_00
 Electrical.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_00
 They're industrial designs.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_01
 Very good.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_01
 I think one that doesn't have lots of super first functions.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_01
 Like I've got one at home that has well, apart from the obvious channels, channel up, channel down volume.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_01
 Subtitles mute.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_00
 That's a really good point because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate, we tend to go to menus and then make choices.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_00
 So if it's like a volume button, you can go in and say mute or volume.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_00
 We don't need to have the numbers.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_00
 We also have channel up channel down.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_00
 We can make it smart like an iPod.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_00
 Make everything menus.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_03
 I know this sounds like it was very quick, but the.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's the industrial design is the first one that's Kate for the working design.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_03
 And user that's used stuff for the technical functions design and for marketing the user requirement specification.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_03
 I think there's going to be a lot of we have to help each other and work through this as a group.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_03
 And I think we all know we like our kitty cat and our rat and our fish, but I think we all have to like each other to get this done.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_03
 As it says, we're going to get individual instructions, but I don't think they will allow a lot of extra time.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_03
 So I think a little bit of less of this and more it do will set us in good stead.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_03
 Do you all agree?

0:13:24	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_03
 Then I don't see any reason to prolong it.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_03
 And we should finish this meeting at night right now and go into other things.

0:13:35	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_03
 So this is the end of the first meeting.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you all.
