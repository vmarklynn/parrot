0:00:00	None
 I was supposed to change seats.

0:00:03	None
 I see you now, since when?

0:00:05	None
 It did.

0:00:06	None
 I hope it disappeared.

0:00:08	None
 I did it no longer somewhere.

0:00:10	SPEAKER_01
 And it disappeared.

0:00:12	SPEAKER_01
 And who's the thing in the jadez this?

0:00:15	SPEAKER_01
 There you go.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_01
 Me too.

0:00:17	None
 I should be sure.

0:00:19	None
 Okay.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_03
 Agnes, you can help me for the spite when I talk to you.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_03
 Welcome back.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_03
 I hope you have fresh air and fresh time.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_03
 Now the meeting actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting.

0:00:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_03
 And we receive some information from all of you.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_03
 And it's in the, I think, in the sharing folder.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_03
 And I will invite the Christine and the aid and Agnes to discuss about on the various subjects.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_03
 So can you go to the next slide?

0:01:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:01:21	SPEAKER_03
 The agent of the meeting is opening.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_03
 Then I'm going to talk about the project management, what I'm going to do.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_03
 And of course, I'm doing the project management and secretary both to take the minutes of the meeting.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_03
 And there are three presentations.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_03
 One is new project requirements.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_03
 And the second one about decision on remote control functions.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_03
 And finally, we are closing and the meeting time will be 40 minutes.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_03
 So you have to be very quick.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_03
 And I have come up with management, come with the new proposal.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_03
 And I have to discuss a few points on this.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_03
 Burt says new insights in the aim of your project.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_03
 The one is the teletext becomes outmodel.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, because of the computer systems and new technology.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_03
 So we don't need to consider really about the teletext and all in our new project design.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_03
 And the second one is about the remote control.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_03
 Should be used only for the TV.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_03
 That's what our management says.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_03
 And the third point, it's very, very important to establish or marketing or corporate image with this new project or new product.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_03
 So I will invite Agnes, can you go to the third slide?

0:02:54	SPEAKER_02
 No, this is the third slide.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, this is it.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_03
 So I will invite Christine to discuss about the functional design.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, do you want to open the ear part?

0:03:15	SPEAKER_02
 Disadvant.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_01
 Number two.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_01
 That's it.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_02
 John Thomas or John Mita?

0:03:26	SPEAKER_02
 I'll do it.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_01
 I'll see.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_01
 Thanks.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_01
 So, well, I figured we should identify some user requirements.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_01
 And from my experience, I want to, and from research I did, the device has to turn the television on and off.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_01
 The first time you press on the big button, you can't have like waffling on this point.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_01
 You know, really, and needs to be able to find it because one of the biggest problems with remote control is finding them.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_01
 So, I also, since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product, that would better look at things that are popular and go beyond those, as I said, in first meeting.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_01
 And then we might want to talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in the construction, especially in the outside of the product so that it gives the appearance and is reliable and so forth.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_01
 I did a little history on the remote controls and when they were invented and so forth.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_01
 So, I guess this guy at Zenith created the Flashmatic, which I kind of liked the idea because it made me think of, maybe the remote control made a big flash when you turn the TV on and off, that might be interesting.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_01
 And so, it was highly directional flashlight that you could turn the picture on and off and the sound on and off and change channels.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_01
 So, I think those are still requirements we have today, 50 years later.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_01
 And it was really a pioneering innovation but it was sensitive to the sun so that it would start off by the, it would easily cause some problems.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_01
 So, I, in addition to looking at the functional grinds, so all these devices are examples of where they represent examples that are available today.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_01
 I think the one in the middle is really something to keep in mind.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_01
 It'd be easy to find and it would, you could throw it at things if the TV didn't turn on and off, you could use it for something else.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_01
 And since I'm not really an industrial designer, I didn't really know what to do with this slide.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_01
 But I just took some different schematics and I put them into this and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were doing a circuit board.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know why we were asked to do this.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_01
 So, personal preferences, I think we could, I'm really thinking outside the box here and I think that we should consider perhaps having a size, a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_01
 So, something that's very, very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_01
 I think you could either be, you could go either one extreme, be very colorful or you could make it clear and kind of blend in with things.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_01
 So, you didn't have to have a problem with the decoration of the user's home.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_01
 I think it needs to be waterproof because sometimes they fall into cups and you know, it might be out by the swimming pool or something like that.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_01
 If you, one of my requirements was about it needs to tell you when it's done its job or not because after time I keep pushing on the remote control and I don't know if it's actually understood my message.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_01
 So, I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue and of course I never want to replace the battery.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_01
 So, those are my preferences and that's my presentation.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_03
 Let me interrupt you. If you can add other facilities, other future like, unbreakable.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_03
 Because especially today you know, you have the family and the kids, the kids throughout and they play with the remote.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_03
 Run over it with the car.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so if you can add the future for your fabric whatever in your outline design with unbreakable.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_03
 I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_03
 Good idea.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_01
 Good idea.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_01
 I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, you can add it in that.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. Thank you, Christine.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_03
 And any questions or clarifications or any discussion on the functional design?

0:08:30	SPEAKER_02
 Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials?

0:08:36	SPEAKER_02
 Because for example, in the unbreakable thing doing something plastic would be harder where it's having something like, I know, steal our titanium.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_02
 It's not titanium, it's economically viable.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_01
 Be heavy too.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_01
 No, I haven't really, I want to feedback.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_01
 I think we need to rate rank these.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_01
 But we'll see what your personal preferences are in your thoughts.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_02
 No, I was wondering whether that you had any.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_01
 I like titanium. It's light.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_02
 Expensive.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_01
 Marketing comes from the process.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_01
 Who said we were, you know, nobody told me how much what our financial objective is.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_01
 So, I'm.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_01
 It'd be hard to inflate something and made out titanium.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the, I'm sorry because the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_03
 Let me go quickly.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe if I can go back.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_03
 I know what a project plan and the budget.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_03
 So, I can close this until.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_03
 I'm closing there.

0:09:42	None
 Okay.

0:10:10	None
 So, let me see where this file.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_03
 That's Christine's.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_00
 This is Christine.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_03
 That's mine.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_00
 I think we're.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_00
 I will say you may.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:03	SPEAKER_03
 The project may be the project.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_03
 A. Okay.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_03
 Or the end of the day.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_03
 The company wants to make at least the 50 million euro.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_03
 And of course, the price will be very reasonable on the sale side.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. That may be you.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_03
 They will talk to you about how much of the price and what's the, how much it's cost for the manufacturing and how much it's going to be.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_03
 We sell in the market.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_03
 Then you can come back with your feedback.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_03
 And I have one maybe the suggestion or opinion.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_03
 This remote control.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_03
 It can be for like a universal to use for any TV.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_03
 And it will be slip.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_03
 Not fat.

0:11:48	SPEAKER_03
 Not fat.

0:11:49	SPEAKER_01
 Not fat.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_01
 It might be hard to find them.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_03
 But let's try it.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_03
 With the different the designs.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_03
 The functional designs.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:02	SPEAKER_03
 So any other questions?

0:12:05	SPEAKER_00
 From her side, I don't think there's too many more questions.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you, Christine.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_03
 For time being.

0:12:12	SPEAKER_03
 So then.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_00
 From the marketing side, just to give an idea what the management is looking for.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_00
 They're looking for a remote control to have a.

0:12:27	SPEAKER_00
 I have a sales price of 25 euro.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_00
 With a production price of a 12 and a half euro.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_00
 For what?

0:12:38	SPEAKER_00
 I think for what we're trying to find which one we're looking for.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think that price is exactly in the market.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 I'll explain myself here now in a sense that in a in the recent surveys.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_00
 From the ages from 15 to 35 80 percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_00
 25 euros.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_00
 That's a pretty reasonable price.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_00
 That's a market price right now.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_00
 Now if we're going to take a risk.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_00
 And push this up a bit, make it more expensive.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_00
 But give them added things that they don't have now.

0:13:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yep.

0:13:15	SPEAKER_00
 Then it could possibly sell.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_00
 Obviously the risk is there.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_00
 Too expensive.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_00
 They're not going to buy.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_00
 But I think there's one other thing interesting.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_00
 Two things that are interesting.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_00
 Is that from the 15 to 35 year old group, which always spends more money on trendy new things.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_00
 Speech recognition is requested.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_00
 We're talking between 75 to 90 percent of this group is willing to pay for a speech recognition on a remote.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_00
 Obviously we can't make a remote into a computer, but maybe simple commands.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_00
 The louder, softer, on, off.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_00
 That might be a possibility, even though a customer to be the first on the market to produce this.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_00
 35 percent say they're too difficult to use.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to figure out a way of making it more user friendly.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_00
 50 percent say they can't find the remote half of the time.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe one word speech recognition command say remote.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_00
 And there's a BB beep and they can find it through ten tons of newspapers, magazines, whatever you have at home.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_00
 But in the cost that the management is looking for, that's not going to be possible.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_00
 But if it's trendy, if it's fancy, it's got some color to it.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_00
 It's very easy to use.

0:14:36	SPEAKER_00
 If it's got simple remote speech remote control, like I said, louder, softer, change channel, on, off.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_00
 Remote and it goes BB beep.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_00
 I can find my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset because I can't turn the TV on.

0:14:52	SPEAKER_00
 So we have to look at it in this global idea with the ideas of the industrial design.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_00
 But price obviously we have to talk about.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_03
 So what do you think about the design statistic?

0:15:09	SPEAKER_03
 Do you think you can make it or?

0:15:14	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_03
 What do you think about the design, what he was talking about?

0:15:21	SPEAKER_03
 Speech recognition.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_01
 Well, training is always an issue with commands.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_01
 So we can perhaps do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process, it could reduce the overall cost.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_01
 Not sure how.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_01
 But anyway, I think also that this might impact the battery life.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_01
 And so maybe what we'll have to do is add something where you can recharge it wirelessly.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_01
 So that you know, send power to it.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_01
 Or maybe set it out in the sun and it gets from the light, a solar cell inside there so that you have enough juice to do all these fancy things.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_02
 It seems also like with the speech recognition, yeah, it's a great feature, but if you're watching TV, there's a lot of ambient sound and it's words.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_02
 It's not just noise is like something hitting.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_02
 It's actual speech, so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the TV speech and the user speech.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_02
 Otherwise, you can say remote.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_02
 But if someone on the screen is saying the same thing, all of a sudden you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies because they've triggered the remote control and it's turned off your TV.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_02
 So I think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems, then yeah, if you're a really good marketing gimmick, but I think we seriously need to consider how that would impact the situation.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_02
 Very good point.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_00
 Well, with speech recognition, I'm not that good at that idea, but if it's a one word recognition, because I know with telephones and cars and things, I've seen it in the States, a guy friend of mine says, call mom and it calls up mom.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_00
 The radio can be on and everything, because I think with speech recognition, if the remote or like the telephone, it has exact word that it has to hear.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think it would come through a sentence on a television.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_00
 If somebody's speaking on the television, they're not going to stop and say, remote.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_00
 So I think that something could be designed to recognize single word. Like the great idea if we can design it.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_00
 This is years ago in the United States, we're driving down and he's called home on the telephone called immediately.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_00
 So that's kind of cute.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_03
 What I can suggest you, Christian, if you need some technical feedback or some training about this facility, especially for the speech recognition, I can recommend you some companies like Inter or IBM, because they're already in this speech recognition part.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_03
 You can maybe have some technical backup from them, some kind of technical tie up.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_03
 If you want, I can coordinate to get some information.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_03
 You can let me know.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_03
 So what kind of details you require to add this future in this project? I don't think it's the difficult.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_03
 We need to know how much is the time frame you need to download, apart from what you have today.

0:19:21	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, we'll find that out.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_00
 From your side, you're going to have to go back to management and be more precise. What do they want?

0:19:32	SPEAKER_00
 A risk, take a risk on the market, something that's going to cost more, but could very easily make a boom in the market.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_00
 Because it has to be something totally different, it has to be totally new, something that nobody has right now.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_03
 It's going to cost. But end of the day, you're the sales guy. So I will come back and sit on your head because you're going to do your sales position.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, it's good to tell the management how much it's cost is and how much you're going to benefit.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_03
 So I don't mind to convey the management to spend some more money on the project, if you can make out of it.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_03
 Obviously, the money from the bottom line is positive.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_03
 I don't mind to convince the management. The management says, they don't want certain facilities, which it's already world.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_03
 They want something new. I think a speech recognition, definitely they're likely.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think they say no for that. I hope I can convince the management on that.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_03
 So if you have any new ideas, you can always come up and tell me if you need any special coordination between any technical companies which you can hide the technology backup for your functional design or technical design.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_03
 Then I'm ready to do that. And what's your comments about?

0:21:07	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I mean, maybe if I go through my presentation, you can sort of see what the user perspective is and how it ties into the other two comments.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_03
 So you finish it so I can handle to a technique.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_03
 Where are you here? Participant 3.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_02
 No, you're in trouble.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. So it would be hard.

0:22:08	SPEAKER_02
 Okay. So basically the method that we usually use in user interface design is that we need to look at what people don't like about existing products in our case existing remote controls.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_02
 And then what the good ideas are and what the bad ideas are and why they're bad and good, which isn't always as obvious.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_02
 We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad, but when you look technically at how it works, sometimes that's not the case.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_02
 Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep because that'll feed into both ed's work and Christine's work.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_02
 And then what the remote control should look like obviously once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_02
 So in terms of the functionalities that we need, you obviously need to be able to turn the TV on and off.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_02
 You need to change channels both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_02
 You need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the TV to regulate contrast or whatever.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_02
 So the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls in general.

 The buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_02
 Often you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done, which you don't necessarily always remember, especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_02
 And that the buttons are too small.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_02
 So here we've got two examples where here on the left hand side you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_02
 And a lot of cases are tiny. They're hard to see. And okay, they're labeled, but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_02
 Whereas on the other side you have a much simpler remote control that I think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_02
 And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_02
 So I would be inclined to go sort of towards this in terms of design rather than this. And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons, then we can figure out how to do it with existing buttons.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_02
 So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to limit or to a minimum, sorry, make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_02
 So like the on button being really obvious when the channel changing and the volume and to keep the design basically sleek and simple, which I think ties into what Christina and Ed have both said fairly reasonably.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_02
 So that's pretty much it.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if you guys have any questions or.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_01
 It seems very understandable clearly your research in an hours, heading in the same direction.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_01
 And the only thing that I saw missing from your research that we found was this ability to find the dog on thing when you need it.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_01
 So that's true. So you know, but that's okay. That's why we're all here at the table. So that if we think of it and our research should indicate certain things and.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's complimentary.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_01
 I also think that.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_01
 The the the feel of it is when you hold it is something that was expressed more in in in my design.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_01
 And that's logical and normal because those are the parameters that industrial designers more thinking about the look in the field.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_02
 And that's definitely a very important factor, especially to use or you're going to be buying the thing and I'm using it almost on a daily basis in a lot of cases, I think.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so I don't have any questions. Sounds good.

0:26:15	SPEAKER_03
 So anybody need any help for time being on this subject. So please come back to me and Christian, maybe I can try to help you to get some the technical.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_03
 The companies to help you for make a design slim.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, and to add some futures like what we're talking about the speech recognition at all.

0:26:40	SPEAKER_02
 Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include because we throw in a lot of features onto the table, but.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_02
 Do we actually want to incorporate all of them or.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_01
 Have we missed anything? Do you want to go back and look at the closing slide? Maybe that would provide some guidance.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_01
 Doesn't really tell us.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_03
 Not a lady.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it says individual actions. It says user, so I'm supposed to do the components concept. Supposed to work on the user interface concept and you're supposed to keep watching the trends.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_01
 And specific instructions will be sent by our coach.

0:27:35	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should do as many features as start with all of them right now and eliminate them later in the process. That's my suggestion.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, that would be great.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_03
 And I'll send you the minutes of.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_02
 You can object if you want.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_02
 No, I'm just thinking in terms of time.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_02
 I'm just.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, now I'm objecting.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_02
 No, I mean, I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just going to end up throwing away?

0:28:04	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_02
 And if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not going to use, maybe it's better to spend it on the thinking more about features that we actually do want.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_01
 I don't get it.

0:28:24	None
 We get it.

0:28:24	SPEAKER_01
 I'm for after the meeting because our meeting time has run out.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_01
 Somebody else has got to use this room and you know, we can't hang out here.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, talk about this.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, what will this love will take for lunch break?

0:28:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, then we can discuss further more.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, with our ideas and then we will come back again in the next meeting.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_03
 So thanks for coming and I'll send you minutes of meeting and please put your all information in the sharing folder so everybody can share the information.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so let's go for lunch time.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_03
 Agreed.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_02
 Agreed.

0:29:12	None
 Okay.
