0:00:00	None
 It was supposed to change seats.

0:00:03	None
 I didn't know this was mine.

0:00:05	None
 It did.

0:00:06	None
 It PowerPoint disappeared.

0:00:07	None
 I did this no-no somewhere.

0:00:09	None
 And it disappeared.

0:00:10	SPEAKER_01
 And whose thing and the jig is this?

0:00:13	SPEAKER_01
 There you go.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_01
 You need to.

0:00:15	SPEAKER_03
 There you go.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_03
 Agnes, you can help me for the smile when I...

0:00:41	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, welcome back.

0:00:43	SPEAKER_03
 I hope you have fresh hair and fresh time.

0:00:49	SPEAKER_03
 Now the meeting actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting.

0:00:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, and we received some information from all of you.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_03
 And it's in the, I think, in the sharing folder.

0:01:08	SPEAKER_03
 And I will invite the Christine and the aide and Agnes to discuss about on the various subjects.

0:01:17	SPEAKER_03
 So can you go to the next slide?

0:01:21	SPEAKER_03
 The agent of the meeting is opening.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_03
 Then I'm going to talk about the project management, what I'm going to do.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_03
 And of course I'm doing the project management and secretary both, okay, to take the minutes of the meeting.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_03
 And there are three presentations.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_03
 One is new project requirements and the second one is about decision on remote control functions.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_03
 And finally we are closing.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_03
 And the meeting time will be 40 minutes.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_03
 So we have to be very quick.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_03
 And I have come up with management come with the new proposal, okay, and I have to discuss a few points on this.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_03
 Both says new insights in the aim of your project.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_03
 The one is the teletext becomes outmodal, okay, because of the computer systems and new technology.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_03
 So we don't need to consider really about the teletext and all in our new project design.

0:02:21	SPEAKER_03
 The second one is about the remote control should be used only for the TV.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_03
 That's what our management says.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_03
 And the third point, it's very, very important to establish marketing or corporate image with this new project or new product.

0:02:49	SPEAKER_03
 So I will invite Agnes, can you go to the third slide?

0:02:54	SPEAKER_03
 No, this is the third slide.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_03
 So I'll invite Christine to discuss about the functional design.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, do you want to open the ear participants?

0:03:17	SPEAKER_01
 Number two.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_01
 That's it.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_02
 Do you want the mouse or do you want me to?

0:03:26	SPEAKER_01
 I'll do it.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_01
 Thanks.

0:03:32	SPEAKER_01
 So, I figured we should identify some user requirements.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_01
 From my experience, I want to, and from research I did, the device has to turn the television on and off.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_01
 The first time you press on the big button, he can't have like waffling on this point.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_01
 And he needs to be able to find it because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_01
 So I also, since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product, that we better look at things that are popular and go beyond those and, as I said, in the first meeting.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_01
 And then we might want to talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use and the construction, especially on the outside of the product so that it gives the appearance and is reliable and so forth.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_01
 I did a little history on the remote controls and when they were invented and so forth.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_01
 So I guess this guy, Zenith, created the flashmatic, which I kind of like the idea because it made me think of maybe the remote control made a big flash when you turn the TV on and off.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_01
 That might be interesting.

0:04:54	SPEAKER_01
 And so it was a highly directional flashlight that you could turn the picture on and off and the sound on and off and change channels.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_01
 So I think those are still requirements we have today, 50 years later.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_01
 And it was really a pioneering innovation but it was sensitive to the sun so that it would start off by the, it would easily cause some problems.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_01
 So in addition to looking at the functional requirements, so all of these devices are examples of where they represent examples that are available today, which I think the one in the middle is really something to keep in mind.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_01
 And it would be easy to find and it would, you could throw it at things.

0:05:56	SPEAKER_01
 If the TV didn't turn on and off, you could use it for something else.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_01
 And since I'm not really an industrial designer, I didn't really know what to do with this slide.

0:06:07	SPEAKER_01
 But I just took some different schematics and I put them into this and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were doing a circuit board.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know why we were asked to do this.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_01
 So personal preferences, I think we could, I'm really thinking outside the box here and I think that we should consider perhaps having a size, a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_01
 So something that's very, very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it.

0:06:44	SPEAKER_01
 I think you could either be, you could go either one extreme, be very colorful or you could make it clear and kind of blend in with things so you didn't have to have a problem with the decoration of the user's home.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_01
 I think it needs to be waterproof because sometimes they fall into cups and you know, it might be out by the swimming pool or something like that.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_01
 If you, one of my requirements was about it needs to tell you when it's done as job or not because after time I keep pushing on the remote control and I don't know if it's actually understood in my message.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_01
 So I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue and of course I never want to replace the battery.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_01
 So those are my preferences and that's my presentation.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, let me interrupt you.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_03
 If you can add other facility, other future like unbreakable.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, because especially today you know, you have the family and the kids, okay and the kids throw it and they play with the remote sign.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_01
 Run over with the car.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so if you can add the future, okay for your fabric, whatever in your outline design, okay, with unbreakable.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_03
 Good idea.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_01
 Good idea.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_03
 I'll be, you can add it in that.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, very good.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, thank you Christian and any questions or clarifications or any discussion on the functional design.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_02
 Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials?

0:08:36	SPEAKER_02
 Because for example, in the unbreakable thing doing something plastic would be harder.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_02
 We're having something like, I know, steal our time.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_02
 Titanium is an elite.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_01
 Titanium is economically viable.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_01
 Be heavy too.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_01
 No, I haven't really, I wanted feedback.

0:08:56	SPEAKER_01
 I think we need to rate rank these.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_01
 But we'll see what your personal preferences are in your class.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_02
 No, I'm just wondering whether that you had any.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_01
 I like titanium.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_01
 It's light.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_02
 Expensive.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, marketing comes out.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_01
 Who said, who said, you know, nobody told me how much what our financial objective is.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_01
 So, yeah.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_01
 It'd be hard to inflate something made out of titanium.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I'm sorry because the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing, let me go quickly.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe if I can go back and order project plan and the budget.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_03
 So, I can close this.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_03
 of course I can.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_03
 So let me see where is this file.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_02
 That's Christine's.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_00
 That's my mom.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_03
 I will say you may.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_03
 The project A, the end of the day.

0:11:12	SPEAKER_03
 The company wants to make at least the €50 million.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_03
 It will be a good idea for the market.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_03
 You can come back with your feedback.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_03
 I have one, maybe the suggestion or opinion.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_03
 It can be for a universal to use for any TV.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_03
 It will be slim.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_03
 It might be hard to find.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_03
 Any other questions?

0:12:15	SPEAKER_00
 I have a sales price of €25.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_00
 I think for what we are trying to find, I don't think that price is exactly in the market.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 I explain myself here now in the sense that in recent surveys, from 15-35-80% are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as Trandy.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_00
 If we are going to take a risk and push this up a bit, make it more expensive, but give them added things they don't have now, it could possibly sell.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_00
 Obviously the risk is there.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_00
 There is one interesting thing that is interesting.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_00
 Speech recognition is requested.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_00
 We are talking between 75-90% of this group is willing to pay for a speech recognition on a remote.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_00
 Obviously we can't make a remote into a computer, but maybe simple commands, louder, softer, on, off.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_00
 That might be a possibility, even though it costs more, to be the first on the market to produce this.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_00
 35% say they are too difficult to use.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_00
 We have to figure out a way of making it more user friendly.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_00
 50% say they can't find the remote half the time.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe one word speech recognition command say remote, and there is a BBB, and they can find it through 10 tons of newspapers, magazines, whatever you have at home.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_00
 The cost that the management is looking for is not going to be possible.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_00
 But if it is Trandy, if it is fancy, it has some color to it.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_00
 If it is very easy to use, if it has got simple speech remote control, like I said, louder, softer, change channel on, off, remote, it goes BBB.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_00
 I can find my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset because I can't turn the TV on.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_00
 We have to look at it in this global idea with the ideas of the industrial design.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_00
 But price obviously we have to talk about.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_03
 So what do you think about the design's characteristics?

0:15:08	SPEAKER_03
 Do you think you can make it or?

0:15:14	SPEAKER_01
 I'm sorry.

0:15:16	SPEAKER_03
 What do you think about the design, what you were talking about, speech recognition?

0:15:21	SPEAKER_03
 Speech recognition.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_01
 Well, training is always an issue with commands.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_01
 So we can perhaps do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process, it could reduce the overall cost.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure how.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_01
 But anyway, I think also that this might impact the battery life.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_01
 And so maybe what we'll have to do is add something where you can recharge it wirelessly so that you know, send power to it.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_01
 Or maybe set it out in the sun and it gets from the light, a solar cell inside there so that you have enough juice to do all these fancy things.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_02
 It seems also like with the speech recognition, yeah, it's a great feature, but if you're watching TV, there's a lot of ambient sound and it's words.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_02
 It's not just, you know, noises like something hitting.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_02
 It's actual speech, so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the TV speech and the user's speech.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_02
 Otherwise you can say remote, but if someone on the screen is saying the same thing, all of a sudden you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies because they've triggered the remote control and it's turned off your TV.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_02
 So I think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems, then yeah, it'd be a really good marketing gimmick, but I think we seriously need to consider how that would impact the situation.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_02
 Very good point.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_00
 Because I would speech recognition, I'm not that good at that idea, but if it's a one word recognition because I know with telephones and cars and things, I've seen in the states, a friend of mine says, call mom and it calls up mom.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, the radio can be on and everything because I think with speech recognition, if the remote or like the telephone, it has an exact word that it has to hear, I don't think it would come through a sentence and a television.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_00
 If somebody's speaking on the television, they're not going to stop and say remote. Okay, so I think that something could be designed to recognize single word. Oh yeah. Yeah.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_00
 Like the telephone.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_00
 It's a great idea if we can design it.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_00
 This is years ago in the United States, we're driving down and he's called home on the telephone call immediately. So that's kind of cute.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_03
 What I can suggest to you, Christian, okay, if you need some technical feedback or some training, okay, about this facility, especially for the speech recognition, I can recommend you some companies like Intel or IBM, okay, because they're already in this speech recognition part.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, and you can maybe have some technical backup from them, some kind of technical tyre. Okay, and if you want, I can coordinate to get some information.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_03
 And you can let me know, okay, so what kind of the details you required, okay, to add this future in this project. I don't think it's the difficult and we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop, apart from what you have today. Okay, we'll find that out.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_00
 From your side, you're gonna have to go back to management and be more precise. What do they want? A risk, take a risk on the market, something that's going to cost more, but could very easily make a boom in the market.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_00
 Because it has to be something totally different, it has to be totally new, something that nobody has right now. Yes, but it costs.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_03
 But at the end of the day, you're the sales guy, so I will come back and sit on your head because you're going to do your sales projection, okay.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_03
 Of course, it's good to tell the management how much it's cost and how much you're going to invent. Okay, and so I don't mind to conveyance, okay, the management to spend some more money on the project.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, if you can make out of. Obviously. The money from the bottom line is positive. I don't mind to convince the management. Okay, the management says, okay, so they don't want certain facilities, which it's already worth. Okay, they want something new. Okay, I think like a speech recognition, definitely they will agree.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think they say no for that. Okay, and I hope I can convince the management on that. Okay, so if you have any new ideas, okay, for you, you can always come up and you can tell me if you need any special, okay, coordination, okay, between any technical companies, which you can hide the technology backup.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, for your functional design or technical design, okay, then I'm ready to do that.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_03
 And what's your comments about?

0:21:06	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I mean, maybe if I go through my presentation, you can sort of see what the user perspective is and how it ties into the other two comments. Yeah, so you'll finish at so I can.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, I'll handle to technique.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_03
 Let's get it close this.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_03
 Where are you here?

0:21:29	SPEAKER_02
 It's been three.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_02
 Here, enjoy.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so basically, the method that we usually use in user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products, so in our case existing remote controls.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_02
 And then what the good ideas are and what the bad ideas are and why they're bad and good, which isn't always as obvious, we seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad, but when you look technically at how it works, sometimes that's not the case.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_02
 Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep because that'll feed into both Ed's work and Christine's work.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_02
 And then what the remote control should look like, obviously, once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_02
 So in terms of the functionalities that we need, you obviously need to be able to turn the TV on and off.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_02
 You need to change channels, both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_02
 You need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the TV to regulate contrast or whatever.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_02
 So the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls in general.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_02
 The buttons, it's not clear what they're supposed to do.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_02
 Often you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done, which you don't necessarily always remember, especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often, and that the buttons are too small.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_02
 So here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_02
 The buttons in a lot of cases are tiny.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_02
 They're hard to see and okay, they're labeled, but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much.

0:23:53	SPEAKER_02
 Whereas on the other side you have a much simpler remote control that I think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_02
 It sort of looks simpler and less imposing when you first look at it.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_02
 I would be inclined to go towards this in terms of design rather than this.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_02
 If there's specific functionalities that require more buttons, then we can figure out how to do it with existing buttons.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_02
 So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a minimum, sorry, make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_02
 So like the on button being really obvious when the channel changing and the volume.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_02
 And to keep the design basically sleek and simple, which I think ties into what Kristina and Ed have both said fairly reasonably.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_02
 So that's pretty much it.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if you guys have any questions or...

0:24:53	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, it seems very understandable. Clearly your research in hours heading in the same direction.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_01
 And the only thing that I saw missing from your research that we found was this ability to find the doggone thing when you need it.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, that's true.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_01
 But that's okay. That's why we're all here at the table.

0:25:25	SPEAKER_01
 So that if we think of it in our research to indicate certain things and it's complementary.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_01
 I also think that the feel of it is when you hold it is something that was expressed more in my design.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_01
 And that's logical and normal because those are the parameters that an industrial designer is more thinking about the look in the feel.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_02
 And that's definitely a very important factor, especially to users who are going to be buying the thing and I'm using it almost on a daily basis in a lot of cases I think.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so I don't have any questions. Sounds good.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so anybody need any help for time being on this subject? Okay, so please come back to me.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_03
 And Christian, maybe I can try to help you to get some of the technical companies to help you for make a design slim.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, and to add some futures like what we were talking about speech recognition at all.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_02
 Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include?

0:26:43	SPEAKER_02
 Because we've thrown a lot of features onto the table, but do we actually want to incorporate all of them or have we missed anything?

0:26:52	SPEAKER_01
 Do you want to go back and look at the closing slide? Maybe that would provide some guidance.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_01
 Doesn't really tell us.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_03
 Not really, this is what we're talking about.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it says individual actions.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_01
 It says user interface, so I'm supposed to do the components concept. I'm supposed to work on the user interface concept and you're supposed to keep watching the trends.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_01
 And specific instructions will be sent by our coach.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_01
 I think we should do as many features as start with all of them right now and eliminate them later in the process. That's my suggestion.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, that would be great.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_03
 And I'll send you the minutes of me.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_02
 You can object if you want.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_02
 I'm just thinking in terms of time.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_00
 You're objecting.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, now I'm objecting.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_02
 No, I mean, I was just thinking, is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just going to end up throwing away?

0:28:03	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_02
 And if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not going to use, maybe it's better to spend it on the thinking more about features that we actually do want.

 I don't get to get a match item for after the meeting, because our meeting time is run out.

 Somebody else just got to use this room and we can't hang out here and talk about this.

 Okay, what we'll take for lunch break, then we can discuss for the more with our ideas and then we will come back again in the next meeting.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_03
 So thanks for coming and I'll send you the minutes of meeting and please put your all information in the sharing folder so everybody can share the information.
