0:00:00	None
 Any specific positions?

0:00:07	None
 I want to sit there with my hand.

0:00:03	None
 I want to be a friend of mine.

0:00:05	None
 Yeah, thank you, President.

0:00:07	None
 Any specific positions?

0:00:08	SPEAKER_01
 I want to sit there with my hand.

0:00:11	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I'm going to raise this before.

0:00:14	SPEAKER_03
 I'll show you some slides.

0:00:17	SPEAKER_00
 It's all very natural.

0:00:33	SPEAKER_00
 It's a little strange.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think it's not bad like this.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_00
 And don't forget to.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_03
 So, hi everyone.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_03
 Thanks for coming to this meeting.

0:01:00	SPEAKER_03
 Well, as you all know, the topic of this morning's meeting is the fact that we're moving and we're going to get more space, so that's a very good piece of news.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_03
 But we also have to find out how we use this space.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_03
 So, if you want, I'll just give a brief overview of what's happening.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_03
 And then we can talk about, well, arranging these new office space.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_03
 So, in case you haven't seen the document, let me just show you very briefly the configuration of the space.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_03
 So, well, there is nothing much to say.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_03
 Well, you know how many of us are present and you know that we're a bit diet, actually, in our present location.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_03
 That's why actually the university finally allocated us this part of the Unimile Building.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's at the sixth floor and it's set of contiguous rooms, as you can all see from here.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_03
 So, the 1P2P3P means the number of persons.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_03
 As you can see, we have a corridor with a number of rooms, 1P2P3 and 3P1.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, I think Agnes did this nice drawing.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_03
 So, she even put the views.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_03
 So we have the old town on one side and the mountains on the outer two sides.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_03
 We have some bathrooms for us.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_03
 And the courtyard, which actually means a sort of shaft because the court is down at the first floor.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_01
 Andre, just a clarification question. Are the number of people per room indicated strict?

0:02:59	SPEAKER_01
 Or can we play around with? I mean, if there are two people, is it really that you can't put three or two and a half?

0:03:06	SPEAKER_01
 Or how was it called?

0:03:08	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's a bit difficult to say because, in fact, we have some constraints in terms of furniture.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_03
 They're here. So, well, your question actually is answered maybe by the third item.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_03
 So, each person should get, well, it's a sort of desk. It's made of two pieces and it looks like a corner, with, of course, a chair, a filing cabinet that goes under the desk.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_03
 And, well, we can put hanging shelves over the desks.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_03
 So, I'm not really sure it's possible to get three desks in a two-person office.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_03
 But we could try. What should be said here? I don't know if, well, you, I will maybe distribute now.

0:03:55	SPEAKER_03
 Documents, if you don't have them, maybe it's easier. Do you need something, Martin?

0:03:59	SPEAKER_03
 I can't keep this for you.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_03
 So, it's, yeah, you have a copy Susan, YouTube, David, I think.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_03
 So, in fact, there are more places than people, so we won't be that constrained.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_03
 As you know, some of us and some of you here actually, Martin, David, our part-time, so it's, for the moment, quite comfortable.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_03
 Normally, we should even get an extra, an extra place for, you know, temporary people coming to work on projects.

0:04:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I counted. So, we have 15 physical persons and about 16, I think, persons, or actually 18 persons in the offices.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, counting the reading room.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_03
 Exactly. So, one of the issues here, it's probably not on the slides, is that we would like to have, unlike what we had until now, lounge or reading room, in one of the offices, so in one of the rooms.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_00
 Do we really need that?

0:05:03	SPEAKER_03
 I think quite a lot of people expressed the need for that, so if we could do it, I think it would be much nicer.

0:05:11	SPEAKER_03
 Let me also say something-

0:05:14	SPEAKER_01
 Don't forget the time we spent for discussions about that room, and be able to volorize this.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_01
 I think we are not so large, as far as space is concerned, because 15 people to put in their 18 positions, so to the best, if you take two people room for the reading room,

0:05:42	SPEAKER_03
 then you have, well, 16 place slots for 15 people, so it's still should be feasible.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_01
 That also means that the growth will be zero.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think that's quite important to manage some space. Maybe we can think of some two or three-

0:05:58	SPEAKER_01
 Visiting people, students, students, etc.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so let me finish with the constraints, which are almost done. So we also need to find a spot for the photocopier, the fax machine, and the printer.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_03
 The fax is very small, but the photocopier is quite huge, huge and the printer is, well, up this size.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_03
 OK, the offices come with whiteboards, not very important.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_03
 The furniture that each person has, and you have a list of people.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_03
 So the thing you ought to know is that we're not the only ones that we're thinking about putting people in these rooms.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_03
 There is another group that is also having discussions.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_03
 So the idea is that today we'll just sort of start seeing the main constraints.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_03
 And then you have time to go and think about it, ask the people, you know, your assistants, for instance.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_03
 And at the next meeting, we'll try to come with one solution.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_03
 The other group will also propose a solution, and then there will be another negotiation.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_00
 And if we don't get this space, then what happens?

0:07:17	SPEAKER_03
 If we don't get these?

0:07:21	SPEAKER_03
 Well, basically, they are promised to us.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_03
 So do you think there are chances that they take from us one of the rooms?

0:07:27	SPEAKER_03
 Or OK.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think it's a chance it might be that there are more

0:07:35	SPEAKER_01
 people to put in that space.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's one of the problems. I think maybe we should take this into account and maybe think of some of the bigger rooms with four people, one being temporary or part-time.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_03
 OK, so maybe we could try to see now what would be the main options, say, the general arrangement options, do you think that we should put people, say, according to projects, for instance, in the table that we also have the main projects on which the people are working?

0:08:15	SPEAKER_03
 So how interesting.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_01
 So if you're interrupting, but one, again, clarification question, what is the real margin of maneuver that we have for these discussions?

0:08:23	SPEAKER_01
 Because at least we have 50% of from EPFL.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_01
 And sometimes you have meetings where the decision is already taken.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_01
 And you can spend quite a lot of time discussing things.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_01
 So what will be the impact of what we will come out?

0:08:42	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, actually, what is fixed is the number of rooms.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_03
 This we cannot really change.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, at least not us.

0:08:50	SPEAKER_03
 It would be much more difficult to get another room, for instance.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_03
 But what is absolutely not fixed is the arrangement of the people in the rooms.

0:08:59	SPEAKER_03
 So basically, where all the permutations are possible.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_01
 Another way of asking the question, is there any other group already working on how this should be allocated?

0:09:11	SPEAKER_01
 Or are we the one that is supposed to do the position hurry?

0:09:15	SPEAKER_03
 Well, what we are looking for is a solution that suits everyone and that makes the maximum of people happy.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_03
 So the other group is, I don't think we have to see them as competitors, but they're just trying to find another local optimum.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_01
 Why don't they have any representative here?

0:09:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, why didn't we have a meeting together?

0:09:34	SPEAKER_00
 They have a lot of group.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_02
 And then Andrea and Angesh will discuss about it with a certain representative of this group.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think that's, yeah, there is no real competition between the two.

0:09:48	SPEAKER_03
 But we'll just try to find at least two solutions and see how close they are, actually.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_03
 I think, well, the people who decided this thought it was the best solution to, well, find two kinds of opinions.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we could have been eight sitting around here and talking, but I think it's more difficult.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_01
 But you know, that's a standard thing.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_01
 It's supposed that somebody for some strange reasons want to be in the corner, and we don't know about that.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_01
 We'll put her or him somewhere else.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_01
 Then we will do plenty of work for nothing because we'll not have this constraint.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_03
 We'll be aware of this constraint.

0:10:28	SPEAKER_03
 Exactly, I think so.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_03
 So today the goal is not to find the solution today, but set some constraints and then go and see the people and find out if they have any preferences.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_03
 Obviously, we won't be able to accommodate all the preferences, but at least we'll find the most important ones.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_00
 Well, certainly we have to ask Pierre and Maggie since they're not here because they also have a lot of students that they have to see as we do.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_00
 And so that's another consideration, too.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think so.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_03
 That's one of the things.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_03
 I think we know that they have students.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_03
 We don't know exactly if they prefer, for instance, to be alone or to be with their assistant or even with another person working on the project.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_03
 So that would have been maybe another solution is to ask everyone to provide an arrangement, but I think that's a bit hard then to work out.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_03
 So since all of you have a copy of the drawing, I think for the next time, maybe you could come with a concrete proposal with names on it.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_03
 But let us try to see today whether we prefer to organize people, say, by projects or just professor and assistant.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_03
 So what would be, say, first your preferences?

0:11:46	SPEAKER_03
 Since let's start with us maybe today.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_03
 What do you think about it?

0:11:51	SPEAKER_03
 Would you prefer to be alone?

0:11:53	SPEAKER_03
 Would you prefer to be with your assistant?

0:11:55	SPEAKER_03
 You who are part-time, do you think you can come here on a very regular schedule or is it part-time but variable during the week?

0:12:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_02
 OK.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_02
 Me, personally, I would like to share the room with assistants as when you have problems of normal life, like the painter doesn't work.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_02
 I don't want to ask this to my supervisor.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_02
 So it's better to be with an assistant to share the room.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_03
 And since you're coming only half-time, do you think you will be able to group your presence here, say, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday morning?

0:12:34	SPEAKER_03
 Or is it going to be much more run-down?

0:12:36	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think it's a good idea to share the same desk.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_02
 I still would like to have my drawers and these things.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think so too.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_03
 So Martin, you're also half-time.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_03
 And well, the third person is Gisela.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's quite clear that each person should have their own desk.

0:12:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I agree with that.

0:12:59	SPEAKER_03
 No way we could put two persons at the same desk.

0:13:04	SPEAKER_01
 Well, part-time is important, is that it's an overload on a room.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_01
 So for sure, if you have a part-time person that reduces the ranges of time where too many people in the room, as far as the end-pons are, I probably might be able to have a regular presence here.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_01
 The thing that, in my case, has to be taken into account is that I will have a lot of phone calls.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_01
 So I'll be talking over the forum all the time.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_01
 So that's not necessarily, well, it depends on, I have nothing against sharing an office with somebody.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_01
 I already did it before, so it was perfectly fine.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_01
 It just has to be somebody who can work while somebody else is having phone calls in the room, which is very much dependent on people.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_01
 Some people are not disturbed by this.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_01
 Some people just can't work.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_03
 Are you disturbed by the phone calls of other people?

0:14:00	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_01
 OK.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_01
 But what might happen, but it will not be so heavy here.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_01
 At ISCO is visitors, so that I will have more at EPFL, typical students coming in or asking for things.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_01
 As I'm not teaching here, I'm teaching at EPFL, this shouldn't be such a big load.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_01
 So for me, it will be essentially.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_01
 I will not be able to be silent in the room because I will be communicating also through vocal means.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_00
 Before talking more about individual preferences, is there any possibility, what they have done in the faculty of law, for example, that they actually split rooms.

0:14:44	SPEAKER_00
 And so we would take one of the two people who was in split it, and you would see that you would have the same size office, but that would give the privacy.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_00
 In so far as in just about every other faculty in the building, every professor has their own office.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_00
 And it really goes a bit far that we have to have all the sharing.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_00
 So one option.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_00
 But that we would need to ask about if we could split one of the rooms.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_01
 Do you go for boxes, for instance, in the bigger rooms, where you know like cubicles?

0:15:15	SPEAKER_01
 Cubicles, yeah.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_00
 That doesn't really solve it.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, there's really a difference in having to have your own.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, sometimes you need to have private discussions with somebody or whatever.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_03
 I will try to find out whether we can separate.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_03
 I think for the moment, the answer at least is no, because it's not only while making a wall, but also making a new door.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_03
 So it's quite a lot of work.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_03
 But I will try to find this out for the next time.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_03
 So at least for the moment, as you can see, there are, I can show them here on the screen.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_03
 So there are these two rooms on the left that accommodate one person.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_03
 So at least some of the professors, since year four, could go, well, take these rooms.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_03
 And quite a lot of rooms with two persons.

0:16:08	SPEAKER_03
 How do you feel, Susan, about the professor sharing the room with her assistant?

0:16:12	SPEAKER_03
 So the one which is the most involved in the teaching?

0:16:16	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I think it's really a matter of personal preference.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_00
 As you know, I prefer to have my own office.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_00
 I also have a lot of phone calls, and you know, have to see people.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_00
 And with the other work that I'm doing with the Rec Direct, that is really confidential information that I'm treating.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_00
 So that I have to be really careful about too.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_00
 But it's a personal preference in so far as what we've had up until now.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_00
 Both Maggie and Pierre have been happy to share with others.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_00
 So I mean, I think we should still check with them.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_01
 I fully agree with that.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_01
 It's much easier to me to foresee having two people of the same position sharing a room than.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_00
 Well, not sharing with each other.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_01
 They share with their students.

0:16:57	SPEAKER_01
 Because it's tricky because of confidentiality reasons, as you said.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_01
 You are discussing a budget on the project over the phone, typically you don't necessarily want to have somebody who will be dependent on that budget being part of the discussion.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's true.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_03
 OK.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we could look a bit at the projects.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_03
 Do you think it's a good idea to put together in the same room as much as possible people from the same project, since they've talked quite a lot of to each other?

0:17:32	SPEAKER_01
 Project doesn't last in time.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_01
 They will change.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_01
 It's the only thing that will change only progressively in time as a status of the people.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_03
 Well, yeah, and some of the PhD students will hopefully

0:17:46	SPEAKER_01
 finish their PhD at some point. That's still something else.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and also some of the people mentioned here are working on more than one project, too.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_00
 So for example, Marianne de Finne, she's also working with me on the virtual campus project.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_00
 So that one wasn't mentioned.

0:18:06	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not saying that I necessarily want to be with her in the office.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_00
 But it's just to say people are working on sometimes more than one project.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_01
 If projects are what you have in mind, I think that the meeting room is the tool for that.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_01
 If you need to have people in the project talking together, they just have a meeting room.

0:18:22	SPEAKER_01
 It's not too far away that it's a very good.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_03
 Well, actually, so the lounge could serve as some kind of meeting room, but there are also more formal meeting rooms available in the building as we now know.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_01
 That's why I was quite receptive to Susan's remark at the beginning is I wouldn't formulate it in such an extreme way as do we really need a lounge, but I would probably formulate it in a way that we want to have only a lounge or something that can be used only as a reading room.

0:18:53	SPEAKER_01
 Because meeting rooms, to me, are very important tools to do collaborative work.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_01
 So I think we need to have to relax.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and I think also we need a separate discussion on the furnishing of the lounge.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_00
 Well, yeah, we'll just get that for now.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_00
 I'll get that for now.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_00
 No, the lounge OK, but I think we need to also see it as an overflow place when we have visitors for any length of time, so they actually have a place to work.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_01
 Because that's really one of my worries with the plan that we have here is that it provides no possibilities of expansion.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_01
 And this will happen.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, you can't prevent having visitors.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_01
 And you shouldn't.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, for the moment, actually, I think only one slot would be fully free.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_01
 For 15 people, it's not enough.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that means one visitor at a time or one intern.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_01
 You have four professors here.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_01
 It's funny that we need two researchers.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_02
 We're not building because we run out of a space and we will have the same problem.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, but we have more space here than we currently have.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's already a progress.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_03
 And you're working.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_03
 I think, yeah.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_03
 OK, so one of the things I have to do for the next time is find out about the separations between rooms.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_01
 Because this is related with security regulation as well.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, you can't just put walls in rooms.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I think it's quite a heavy transformation of the building.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_01
 It's not necessarily heavy in terms of work.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_01
 It's heavy in terms of administrative authorization.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_03
 And OK, I'll try to find out.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_03
 And the other question is, can we squeeze maybe four people in the, or at least four places in the three P room?

0:20:34	SPEAKER_01
 I think so.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_01
 If you organize the desks in an intelligent way.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, hopefully visitors don't need as much, say, filing space.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_03
 Or, yeah, that's the point.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, they don't have that many papers.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_03
 OK, so that's, I have to ask.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_03
 So you don't really feel very strongly attached to this grouping by project idea.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_00
 No, because it can share their ideas across the project.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_01
 Coffee machines, I'll be late for that.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, exactly.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_02
 When newer assistants come, they would like to share the room with someone that knows it's related with a project.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_01
 So proximity doesn't play a big role there.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_01
 You can discuss with people.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_01
 And space is very small.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, altogether.

0:21:24	SPEAKER_01
 And you don't need to discuss about the projects.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_01
 You more need about to discuss about where is the printer, how do I get furniture.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_01
 I don't have a pencil.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_01
 Where is the box with the pencils and so on.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_01
 This is not project related.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_00
 No, if you look now at the current division of the offices, for example, Bruno and the Agnes are sharing an office.

0:21:49	SPEAKER_00
 And they're working on totally different projects.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_00
 And then they're just fine with that.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think that's going to be one of the main things we'll have to ask, is whether people have strong preferences, either in staying with someone or in not staying.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_03
 Are you aware of any strong constraints right now?

0:22:10	SPEAKER_00
 Well, there were, but they sort of disappeared out of October when smoking located.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_00
 Because before we were doing the smokers, and now that there's no smoking, I guess that's not a very important option.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_03
 OK, yeah, that's true.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_03
 So smoking is now no longer constrained.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_00
 Well, except for you, maybe you don't even want anybody smoking on your balcony.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_02
 Is it allowed to smoke inside an office?

0:22:34	SPEAKER_00
 If it's one person, not anymore.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_00
 No, it's not smoking campus.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_00
 In principle, it's a no smoking building.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_00
 You can smoke outside.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_00
 So you can go outside onto the balcony.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_00
 Even in the cafeteria?

0:22:44	SPEAKER_00
 Not even in the cafeteria.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's a new regulation.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_00
 For all of the 6,000 students.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_03
 On the roof, maybe.

0:22:52	SPEAKER_03
 On the balcony, actually.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so balcony.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_00
 Normally.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_00
 There's that terrace.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_02
 But Andre, there's no place inside the building.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_02
 Wow, I typically say it's not a smoking campus, but there are some places though.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_01
 Still some places, most people can survive.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_01
 But Andre, just to commend the ball about your previous request, I don't think that anyone will provide you information such as who doesn't want to be with whom.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_01
 That's a typical output of research and expert systems.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_01
 These are the ones that you'll never get.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_01
 But you can get them through a proposal.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_01
 So you propose a set up where people are with other peoples, and they will find politically correct ways to tell you that they don't want to have a view on the mountains, but they prefer to have you on the old town.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_01
 On the toilets?

0:23:38	SPEAKER_01
 On the toilets.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_01
 They prefer to be in another one.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_00
 We do have one constraint that's difficult, which is in Gisela.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_00
 Because once you're there, she's very noisy.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_00
 She's on the phone a lot.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_00
 That's the admin house.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_00
 It's part of the work.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_00
 It's the nature of her work that a lot of it is clearly.

0:23:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, Martin's had also for him, and especially for her, she's the interface.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_01
 That's a problem, you're right.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_01
 Because we don't have enough one person rooms for accommodating the admin place.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_01
 And if you put two persons or three persons for the admin space, who else will you put in there?

0:24:19	SPEAKER_01
 Because we don't have any system manager, or we don't have only half part, half time admin, and no other non-researcher positions, if I'm not mistaken.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_01
 And this is really a piece of a problem.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you could put some visitors.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_01
 I think very realistic in an admin space.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_03
 I think putting Gisela with the other admin of the school is not an option, because they weren't offered.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_00
 Excellent idea.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it would be nice.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_03
 Why don't we ask about that?

0:24:46	SPEAKER_01
 OK, I'll try to find out, but I'll put the researcher there.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_01
 Either you lose one position, or you find another admin or a system manager.

0:24:56	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, there is certainly enough space down the hall with all of those offices that are where half of them are also half time, and they're very underused.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_03
 OK, well, try.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_03
 But always say sort of difficult questions, because they involve changing also the offices of the school, and people just don't want to change in general.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_03
 Let's see, maybe we can find some temporary, well, at least a proposal for Gisela.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_03
 So since the one person rooms are quite, well, sort of desired by a lot of people,

0:25:29	SPEAKER_01
 it should probably be. That's not true.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_01
 To me, there are two options possible.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_01
 It is either we can take one of the one person rooms for the admin, because some of typically the professors have good reasons for sharing.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_01
 Sharing either with a colleague or sharing with one of their PhD students.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_01
 In that case, it's realistic.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_01
 Then we could very, very simply allocate the one of the one person rooms for the admin, and that would solve the problem.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_01
 The other thing is to take a two person room for the admin.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_01
 That could be the one close to the center.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_03
 The middle one here?

0:26:10	SPEAKER_01
 But no, no, no, the other one.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_01
 The one up, yeah, this one.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_01
 But then the question of what do we do with the second position there remains fully open.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_01
 So I would be more of the opinion to see whether it's so evident that, let's say, at least the two full time professors that are here on the list.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_01
 We have one here, but Maggie is not present.

0:26:34	SPEAKER_01
 If they really...

0:26:35	SPEAKER_00
 And I'm correct too.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I'm correct.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if because of personal preferences, they would be happy with a two person room, which might or might not be the case.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it's certainly not something that we should impose, but we can ask.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, because in this case, yeah, Gisela could take one of the two person rooms, and the other place would be for some kind of visitor.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_01
 But it's not realistic, neither.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, you have a foreign researcher coming visiting you, and you will put him in the admin office.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_01
 OK, you'll not do that.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_01
 Maybe you can do that with an exchange student.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, or an intern.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_00
 With younger people, yeah.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_01
 You can't take a senior visitor and sit him in the secretary.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_00
 We invite Nagao, and we say, OK, you can sit with Gisela.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, OK.

0:27:25	SPEAKER_03
 OK, so this sits a bit the stage for Gisela.

0:27:29	SPEAKER_03
 Then, yeah, we'll try to find out.

0:27:33	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, maybe we should remind that quite a lot of professors at the school actually share their office with their assistant.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_03
 So it looks like sort of an implicit tradition.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe not to be followed.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_00
 Except for every other faculty.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_00
 OK.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, that's all.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, it is so.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_00
 Every other faculty, as far as I have seen their offices and the people that I know, and that's in law, socioeconomic, OK?

0:28:03	SPEAKER_00
 They all have their own office.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, and the law faculty, they're at best they have done.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_01
 As we said, it's really a matter of personal preference.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_01
 It cannot be something else.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_01
 It cannot be imposed, for sure.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_03
 OK, so I think, well, this sets a bit the stage.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_03
 Could we try?

0:28:23	SPEAKER_03
 So could you try, please?

0:28:25	SPEAKER_03
 Do you want an extra piece of paper?

0:28:27	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe try to, well, think on your own, and then talk a little bit just to the people around you.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_01
 Again, Andre, I think that the only realistic way we can do is to speak for ourselves.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_01
 I can tell you, according to what I know now, where I would like or would be ready to be.

0:28:47	SPEAKER_01
 But I really don't see how I could decide for Maggie or Pierre et or whoever else on the list.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_03
 No, the point was to try to, well, just talk to them.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_01
 Like David, go on.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_01
 We do it for the set up of meetings.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_01
 Everyone receives that and should provide, yeah, I would like to be here.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_01
 And then you have this multi-constrain problem, and you work three or two hours.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_03
 So we just ask people just for their place, or also for the other people's place.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_01
 Because that's the important thing you want to know.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_02
 What about the cafeteria?

0:29:23	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, we are going to pay you a cafeteria with a projector and all this, all together.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_01
 It's all together.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_02
 It's not too cafeteria.

0:29:31	SPEAKER_02
 So in the open room.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_01
 But that's an open question.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_01
 Whether it's a, at the origin, it was supposed to be a pure reading room for relaxing, reading the newspapers, et cetera, et cetera.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_01
 There has been a very long discussion about that.

0:29:44	SPEAKER_01
 I think this discussion is to vivid that some of the people, I belong to these people who like to have a mixed room, where you can have a reading room for sure, but also a meeting room if necessary.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_01
 Or as Susan said, a room, an emergency room, where you can put some visitors in a decent environment for work, because you don't have any other place to do it.

0:30:07	SPEAKER_01
 But that's really an open discussion.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_01
 I think no decision, no final.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_03
 OK, then for the next time, try to come up either with your own preferences.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_03
 That's quite easy, probably, to state now that you know the constraints.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_03
 Or if you can poll a little bit the people around you, that would be, I mean, given.

0:30:27	SPEAKER_01
 The one that I don't want to have in the next room?

0:30:30	SPEAKER_03
 Well, just discuss it.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, for instance, I mean, no, no, I was thinking, just ask people around you what they think about this.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_03
 And I think it would be nice to come with maybe a sketch of these, if you can do slides.

0:30:41	SPEAKER_03
 It's even better, but don't be that formal.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_03
 And we'll try to at least build up one coherent proposal and we'll merge it with the other one when the other one is available.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_00
 I'll ask Megan Pierre to say that.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, great.

0:30:58	SPEAKER_00
 That would be great.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_01
 That would be great.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_01
 That, of course, is one of the main, well, not main, but one of the important features that we need to do about it.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, and they're not at the meeting, I think it's.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_00
 And I'll try to.

0:31:11	SPEAKER_00
 We should first ask them.

0:31:12	SPEAKER_02
 Just for finishing, I mean, we have a cafeteria or we don't need it at all.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_02
 We don't have cafeteria.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_02
 What do you mean by cafeteria?

0:31:18	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think we can.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_02
 We can place the one.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_02
 We can take a coffee also.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_01
 There is no coffee in the reading room.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we can bring your coffee in the reading room.

0:31:27	SPEAKER_01
 But you have any money for buying the coffee machine.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_03
 So since maybe your part time here and part time at EPFL, there are at least two coffee machines in the building, one at the third floor, one at the first floor.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_02
 And we can close our coffee.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_03
 No, automatic coffee machines.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_03
 So, yeah.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_00
 No, there's the cafeterias downstairs.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_00
 But they close at five.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_02
 That's the main problem.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but there's the two machines.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_00
 And they're the vending machines where you just put them in machines.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_01
 And you can bring your coffee in the reading room.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, maybe this is not a very bad timing.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_03
 Could we try to meet next Tuesday?

0:32:07	SPEAKER_03
 Next Tuesday, maybe a bit later, maybe at 11 o'clock.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_00
 Wait, wait, wait.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_00
 Tuesday.

0:32:12	SPEAKER_00
 Tuesday.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_03
 Come on, try to be nice.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_00
 Give me a reasonable date.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_00
 It's a good time meeting.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_00
 We have the other meeting, the MDM meeting in the morning.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_00
 So it would have to be in the afternoon.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_00
 OK.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_00
 Next Tuesday, we have a meeting.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, exactly.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_01
 That might be where is the meeting?

0:32:32	SPEAKER_01
 It's email?

0:32:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_01
 OK, so yeah, yeah.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_01
 Then it could be.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_00
 At 9.30, but we could have this meeting in the afternoon.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_00
 OK.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_01
 That would be great, because that would allow us not to move.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_01
 Very well.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_01
 So about two o'clock?

0:32:45	SPEAKER_01
 Would that be OK?

0:32:46	SPEAKER_01
 After lunch.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_01
 After lunch.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_03
 It's not a very demanding meeting.

0:32:48	SPEAKER_03
 So OK, perfect.

0:32:53	SPEAKER_03
 Then let me close this.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_03
 And good luck for your arrangement games.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_02
 We're not using the time.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_02
 Not that they can track the time.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_01
 Those could take place.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_02
 But you were not using it.

0:33:28	None
 No.

0:33:29	SPEAKER_02
 OK.
