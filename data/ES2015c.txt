 SD 3. SD 3 On the agenda for this particular meeting will have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting after we came up with some general ideas of our design.

0:01:11	SPEAKER_01
 And then we have to make some key decisions on our remote control concept and how we're going to make it what material we're going to use and that sort of thing.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_01
 The meeting will be 40 minutes long and we'll once again have Poppy as our first presenter.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_01
 Alright, now we'll switch up PowerPoint.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:01:40	None
 Okay.

0:01:48	SPEAKER_03
 Should be just loading.

0:01:53	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, although I can't see it on my screen.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_00
 Let's just go here.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_00
 We've been doing some research into the different components that we could use.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_00
 What's available to us to actually make the remote control.

0:02:14	SPEAKER_00
 First of all, we have to look at how the remote control is actually made and what is it happens inside the casing, which is what you're feeling.

0:02:23	SPEAKER_00
 The main internal feature is a circuit board which contains all the electronics and also the contacts with the power source, which is not necessarily a battery is without to see.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_00
 There are several components of the circuit board that we need to consider where we'll be getting them from what they'll be made of, including the integrated circuit, which is also known as the chip, which is where all the main information is contained.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_00
 Diode, transistors, resonators, resistors and capacitors all need to be considered as well and all their positioning in the circuit.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_01
 Are they all included like mandatory or are there these different options?

0:03:08	SPEAKER_00
 They're all different options.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_00
 Apart from the chip, which we will probably decide whether we buy a simple or regular advance.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_00
 All the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately and work out the most effective circuit, including all the wires and that and the LED.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_00
 That's the light emitting diode, so we've got flexibility with colours and things with that as well.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_00
 There are lots of different possibilities for the energy source. We could use a basic battery, but that brings with it, like there needs to be recharged and the bulk, the sides of it as well.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_00
 They're not so great to dispose of environmentally.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_00
 There's the hand-powered dynamo, which is the sort of thing that was used for torches 50 years ago, a bit out of date.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_00
 Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed. What is a hand-powered dynamo? Where you manually charge up the power.

0:04:09	SPEAKER_00
 Just every once in a while.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry? Just every once in a while, constantly.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, every once in a while, I think.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_01
 It'd be kind of strange to always be able to do that.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, be like going a step back in time. I don't think it would really be with cutting edge technology.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_00
 Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's been used by some watches and other devices where you just shake the device, and it gives it power.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_00
 The kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_00
 Or the solar power, which we're considering inside a building, which is where it's going to be used, might not be quite so useful.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_00
 But good to look into. Renewable energy. Always the way.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_00
 Lots of considerations for the case. Like what sort of shape it would be curved or flat.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_00
 That's got a lot to do with the ergonomics. I think how it's comfortable and sits in the hand.

0:05:07	SPEAKER_00
 We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up or too small or too sliding.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_00
 I know I've had a remote control before, which you can tell which was the front and the back.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_00
 I had so many buttons on and the shape was so symmetrical that I'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_00
 Because you can't really see which way around it.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_00
 We also can choose what materials. We could use metal. We could use rubber, which might be more ideal for the anti-RSI.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_00
 It's the same rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that. So it's very soft and not so stressful on your hands.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_00
 Wood. Again, stepping back inside, I don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_00
 Detainium is not going to be possible. It's just a beyond our budget really. But what would it be for future projects?

0:06:09	SPEAKER_00
 I have a choice of buttons as well. We've developed some good advances in technology with our research team.

0:06:16	SPEAKER_00
 We've found some new multiple options, scroll buttons. I think that was brought up before.

0:06:26	SPEAKER_00
 They're basically quite flexible design. Modern. You don't have to use individual buttons.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_00
 You can just slide up and down. I'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobile or computer laptop.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_01
 One thing with the scroll buttons though, we would have to have an LCD display.

0:06:47	SPEAKER_00
 That would be the lower dark thing.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_00
 If we have...

0:06:52	SPEAKER_00
 Going on to that later with the LCD, that means we need an advanced chip.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_00
 It's unlikely that that's going to be an average. Also we've got the integrated push button, which is what we're most familiar with.

0:07:05	SPEAKER_00
 This is the most straightforward, but you can incorporate that with the scroll button as well.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_00
 Good decision to make there. This is what I was just saying for.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_00
 Link to the different depends on what type of buttons we have in the inputs.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_00
 Simple, go with the push button. Regular, you could link with the scroll button.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_00
 The advanced would have to go with a LCD display.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_00
 My personal preferences, I think we could go for the kinetic energy source.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's quite an advanced technology. It's not been seen before, so it could be quite a novelty factor, attractive as well.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_00
 Also, energy savings, because you're producing the energy.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_00
 You don't need an external battery supply or solar panels. You just give it a shake.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_00
 Sounds brilliant to me.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_00
 Rubbing casing, I think we're probably the best if we're going for the anti-RSI and more choice with aesthetics.

0:08:09	SPEAKER_00
 It could be pretty much any color in one.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_00
 It gives you more flexibility there.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_00
 Probably the regular chip is supposed to be simple, and we could possibly have the scroll, and the push, but no LCD.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_00
 We probably can't afford that one.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_01
 One concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as the exterior. This is the one thing that's protecting its innards.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_00
 I think that would be more internal casing, and the rubber would just be what's in contact with the human hand.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_01
 Another thing is it might be more difficult.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_01
 If it's a rubber exterior, we're talking about putting on interchangeable plates.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_01
 I don't see how a rubber plate going on top would stay there.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_01
 It would be like a clip on plastic plate.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_01
 It would work that way.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe if it was just more of a rubber coating, which was onto a case, so the whole thing would be removable.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_03
 Plastic with rubber.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_00
 I can't think of what.

0:09:28	SPEAKER_03
 Well, there's a certain phone that has a rubber casing.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_00
 Or you can get out a casing for iPods and something that's just protective as well.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_00
 It stops it.

0:09:40	SPEAKER_00
 It would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_00
 It wouldn't damage its top.

0:09:46	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe a mixture of both.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_02
 The actual remote would be hard plastic.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_02
 The buttons obviously are rubber.

0:09:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 That sounds good.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_01
 Is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber?

0:10:05	SPEAKER_00
 As far as I know, it should be.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_00
 We'll just say yeah.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_01
 Just one more.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, yeah.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_01
 I like the kinetic energy source idea.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know when people will be moving or remote around a lot.

0:10:22	SPEAKER_01
 But I think that it's worth it.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_01
 Just for environmental reasons.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_02
 I guess it's a bit scary because it hasn't been done before.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_02
 So it seems we'd have to do more research on it.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_02
 Or you could have a battery pack.

0:10:44	SPEAKER_00
 Like a backup.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:46	SPEAKER_02
 There is a one battery.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_02
 Because most remote's use two batteries, really.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_02
 So it was running off of one battery.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_00
 It's an alternative just in case.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we could...

0:10:59	SPEAKER_03
 You were saying about solar power.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe not working indoors.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_03
 That's true.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_03
 I just thought about it.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:08	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe that could be the backup instead of a battery.

0:11:13	SPEAKER_02
 Although it's in the sunlight, doesn't it?

0:11:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_01
 You can't watch TV in the dark then.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_00
 It's true.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_00
 But it's not you don't need the solar all the time.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_00
 It can be stored.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_00
 It can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_01
 It just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day.

0:11:35	SPEAKER_01
 Like a few hours a day.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_02
 I think that might be a little impractical.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_01
 I think sometimes it's just shoved under a cushion.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_00
 You could easily...

0:11:44	SPEAKER_00
 People don't want to have to worry about that.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_00
 I suppose it would be really annoying if you get to...

0:11:49	SPEAKER_00
 I suppose it's a huge one where it votes.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_00
 It's a kinetic thing.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's best about that.

0:11:52	SPEAKER_00
 It's instant energy.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_00
 You don't have to...

0:11:54	SPEAKER_00
 You can shake it a few times or whatever.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_00
 Or just like work it up when you're going to...

0:11:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_00
...use it instead of you don't have to make sure it's in the right place to charge.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:12:05	SPEAKER_01
 Alright.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_01
 Cool.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_01
 Is that the end of your presentation?

0:12:09	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_01
 Alright.

0:12:11	None
 Thank you.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_00
 There we go.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_00
 It's...

0:12:28	None
 Oh.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_03
 It's not on my screen.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_03
 Why?

0:12:46	SPEAKER_00
 It wasn't on my knife.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_00
 I think I just...

0:12:49	SPEAKER_00
 I just use the mouse one.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, okay.

0:12:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:12:56	SPEAKER_03
 I'm just going to go through the interface concept with you tonight.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_03
 First of all, explain what a user interface is.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_03
 It's the aspects of the computer system which can be seen or otherwise seen, for example, hair or...

0:13:13	SPEAKER_03
...fell, maybe a...

0:13:16	SPEAKER_03
...by the human user.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_03
 And it's also the command that the user uses to control its operation and to input data.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_03
 There are two types of user interfaces.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_03
 There's the graphical user interface which emphasizes the use of pictures for our fit and a point device.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_03
 For example, a mouse for effort control.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_03
 Is that something like the schools that we were talking about?

0:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, okay.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_03
 I'm not really sure about the pictures...

0:13:51	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe that's on an LCD screen.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_03
 Or maybe it's the buttons and...

0:13:58	SPEAKER_03
...pitch...

0:14:00	SPEAKER_03
...shoot something.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_00
 So I suppose that's...

0:14:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, because...

0:14:07	SPEAKER_01
...after?

0:14:08	SPEAKER_01
 Because the command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_01
 So the numbers are sort of like a keyboard.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_01
 You're pressing the numbers for...

0:14:18	SPEAKER_01
 So you want...

0:14:20	SPEAKER_03
 For the graphical user, you must use some kind of presentation for the graphics.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_00
 I suppose on some buttons you'd have...

0:14:30	SPEAKER_00
...the power would be some kind of symbol.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_00
 If you wanted to go on to tell a text, I know we're not having that, but a similar thing.

0:14:39	SPEAKER_00
 There's a little picture with a screen with lines across it, which...

0:14:43	SPEAKER_00
...is that sort of thing.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_00
 The symbol on the button.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_00
 But if we're having a simplified display, anyway...

0:14:51	SPEAKER_00
...we would have to focus so much on that and be more than the numbers in the volume.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_00
 It would be more command interface.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_00
 So it needs to think of symbols for the volume display.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_02
 So it's just graphical for the pointing aspect.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_02
 The infrared is like that's considered.

0:15:07	SPEAKER_03
 No, I think it did do with the actual symbols that are on the...

0:15:12	SPEAKER_03
...that's on the buttons of the control and...

0:15:15	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so when it says pointing, that doesn't include...

0:15:17	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it could be a school thing and something can come up from this.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I've learned something about LCD type things.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_03
 But...

0:15:28	SPEAKER_03
 I think we're gonna go with the command interface, anyway, to make it a little bit...

0:15:33	SPEAKER_03
...but we could incorporate some of the graphical uses points...

0:15:40	SPEAKER_03
...just to make it nicer to look at, maybe...

0:15:44	SPEAKER_03
 What do you mean?

0:15:45	SPEAKER_03
 Like...

0:15:46	SPEAKER_03
 I can't think of an example, but...

0:15:49	SPEAKER_03
...sort of like little petrushed baller than...

0:15:53	SPEAKER_03
 Oh yeah, like how the buttons...

0:15:55	SPEAKER_03
...instead of saying volume, like a little speaker...

0:15:57	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, as a button, though.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_01
 So it's a keyboard in the shape of it, right?

0:16:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, maybe.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I like that.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_03
 I do.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_03
 The...

0:16:08	SPEAKER_03
...with the set of the command interface, you see the most useful element of control...

0:16:12	SPEAKER_03
...as it would be less complicated.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_03
 The control would be more than music, than like...

0:16:19	SPEAKER_03
...the normal control of the cheaper design...

0:16:22	SPEAKER_03
...that we'd have more money in the budget...

0:16:25	SPEAKER_03
...to target the design of the interface...

0:16:29	SPEAKER_03
...you would make it more trendy in the original...

0:16:31	SPEAKER_03
...we would have more money if we keep it simple.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I'm sure like, kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget...

0:16:37	SPEAKER_03
...a bit more to it.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_03
 Quite in the technology.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_03
 We also have to keep in mind when we're designing our...

0:16:50	SPEAKER_03
...more users and like...

0:16:52	SPEAKER_03
...we're working through a lot of interfaces, concepts of the clutter, buttons...

0:16:56	SPEAKER_03
...that the functions, colors and forms aren't always helpful.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's true.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_00
 The buttons are all the different colors for different choices...

0:17:09	SPEAKER_00
...and things can be a bit...

0:17:11	SPEAKER_00
...over and over.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_03
 And that all interfaces are different.

0:17:17	SPEAKER_03
 That doesn't improve the use of products, so we need to come up with something...

0:17:23	SPEAKER_03
...that's easy to understand...

0:17:26	SPEAKER_03
...and maybe learn from these stakes of all interfaces...

0:17:30	SPEAKER_03
...that can be too complicated for people to use.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_03
 Does anyone have any questions?

0:17:41	SPEAKER_01
 Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same color...

0:17:45	SPEAKER_01
...just to keep it a simplistic look?

0:17:49	SPEAKER_02
 I think if we go with the design plate thing, we'll have to...

0:17:53	SPEAKER_02
...just because of color clashing and...

0:17:56	SPEAKER_02
...if we wanted to.

0:17:58	SPEAKER_02
 So we might...

0:17:59	SPEAKER_02
...depending on what comes out of the design, we might have to stick to just black buttons.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_01
 But what about the lighting up effect?

0:18:06	SPEAKER_02
 You mean different colors for the lighting, or...?

0:18:09	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I thought we had decided that...

0:18:13	SPEAKER_01
...if you touch one of the buttons, they'd all light up.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_01
 And so if they were black, it would be possible for them to light up.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I see what you're saying.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if they were white, they would glow.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_01
 Probably if they were made in rubber.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, so you were picturing the light coming from the back.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_02
 I kind of pictured it as...

0:18:31	SPEAKER_02
...kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I like coming from the back.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_00
 I'd seen like an internal light.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it comes through.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_00
 So there would have to be some parts, maybe transparent around the buttons.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_01
 Right, but...

0:18:49	SPEAKER_01
...it's a little bit more transparent.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_01
 And rubber is a more translucent product too, so it should be able to...

0:18:54	SPEAKER_03
...that taken care of.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_03
 And the phone that I was thinking of, when you change the covers of it, the little buttons that actually...

0:19:03	SPEAKER_03
...you know, that...

0:19:05	SPEAKER_03
...are behind the rubber.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_03
 So you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah, this is too short.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, okay.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_03
 Behind them.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I don't have to say that one color of each face could have a color of that color.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if they're raised up buttons, so that you can feel them, we were talking about it being more...

0:19:36	SPEAKER_01
...a lot more tangible.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_01
 It might be more difficult to do.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_01
 If they're sticking up, if it's flat, then...

0:19:46	SPEAKER_01
...like, I'm on a cell phone or a mobile phone.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_01
 It's like all very flat, and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_00
 I think it would be possible.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think it would make that much difference.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, the dimensions of...

0:20:04	SPEAKER_00
...if it's just constructed in the same way as the front cover of the mobile phone, you can take off the hard cover, and then there's the buttons, and then you get to the circuit.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the top casing.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sure you could work it out to fit in the casing without causing too much...

0:20:26	SPEAKER_00
...to be fine.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_01
 If it's doable, you can...

0:20:32	SPEAKER_01
...that would be good to me.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:20:38	None
 Okay, is that my turn?

0:20:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:20:43	SPEAKER_02
 You're up.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_02
 I have a shorter report for you today.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_02
 It took a while to get this.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_00
 I'm not plugged in yet.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, that's a very good point.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so this report is about trend-watching.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_02
 I'm basically...

0:21:34	SPEAKER_02
...so I'm having a very fashionable remote control.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_02
 So, just so you know, my method was mainly web-based research this time around.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_02
 I also spoke with fashion experts in Milan, New York, and Paris.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_02
 And I looked at the design reports from previous years here at Real Remote.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_02
 We can work off with them and see how fashion's have changed.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_02
 So I'll list the three most important aspects that I've come across.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_02
 And they're each more important than the one that comes after it.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_02
 The first one is that there should be a fancy look and feel.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_02
 Instead of the current functional look and feel, this should be our priority, as we've been saying.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_02
 The second most important aspect is that the remote control should be technologically innovative.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_02
 So I think we've done a lot of talking about that, just with lighting and the buttons and the face plates.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_02
 So we'll be able to keep on track with that.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_02
 And the third most important aspect is that their remote control should be easy to use.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_02
 So I'm pretty basic there.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_02
 The recent fashion update, according to fashion washers in Paris and Milan, is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes, shoes, and furniture.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_02
 Also, in contrast to last year, the field of the material is expected to be spongy.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_02
 Again, we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_02
 So my personal preference is here.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_02
 Of course, we've already talked about the personal face plates in this meeting, and I'd like to stick to that.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_02
 The fruits and vegetable themes, I don't know if that's going to work for us.

0:23:03	SPEAKER_02
 It sounds something that you do is on kitchenware.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if we want to do it on our modes.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_02
 It could be one of the options, maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_02
 The temporary light-up idea, sounds like we're going to stick to that.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_02
 And then tying in a trendy look with user-friendlyness.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_01
 The fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find, rather jarring.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_01
 Everything else we can really do, according to our plans, already given the market.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_01
 But fruits and vegetables seem a very strange idea.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_02
 It's a lot of love, but it's everywhere.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe we've seen a lot of purses with olives on them.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_02
 But I think we stick to TV-based shows or holidays.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_01
 But they still need to fit into people's decor, though.

0:23:55	SPEAKER_00
 I think we could possibly take a more abstract design, like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables, and then just really strip it down to really basic shapes.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry, but it could have the curves of a strawberry, or a strawberry seed, or a leaf.

0:24:19	SPEAKER_00
 Just like, you know, really make it quite abstract if that fits in more with what we're doing, instead of fruits and vegetables, just to be looking straight forward as a bit.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it doesn't quite fit in with the trendy.

0:24:33	SPEAKER_00
 Well, obviously it does if that's the case, but maybe we could go more directly.

0:24:38	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know, but initially, I think if we just sort of turn it down a bit.

0:24:45	SPEAKER_00
 And like, no.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_01
 And like, photo is not fruits.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_02
 One thing I was thinking, though, is I don't know if you'll remember from our kickoff meeting, we talked about our favorite animals.

0:24:55	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe there could be animal-based, you know, because a lot of people have a house cat or a dog.

0:25:01	SPEAKER_02
 That might be getting, you know, too specific, and we should see what the success of the first face plates are.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_02
 But it's something to keep in mind.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_02
 And did you have any questions?

0:25:16	SPEAKER_02
 Pretty straight forward.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_01
 All right, given that information, we need to start making some more specific decisions.

0:25:31	SPEAKER_01
 So I'll need to hook up the PowerPoint again.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_01
 There you go.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_02
 Have you guys been saving your PowerPoint presentations to the...

0:25:54	SPEAKER_00
 I didn't, for the first one, but I have now.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_00
 It's still around, right?

0:25:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_00
 Where are you going?

0:26:01	SPEAKER_00
 Project documents, I think.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_01
 Let's just try to make this pop up now.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_01
 All right, here we go.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so we have to decide now exactly what we are going to do.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_01
 So energy, we owe.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_01
 Oh no, I can't write it in when it's in this setting.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_01
 So we don't know how to take it out of...

0:26:50	SPEAKER_01
 To the PowerPoint.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_01
 So back to decisions.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_01
 Energy.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_01
 We've decided on kinetic.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so that's good.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_00
 Are we going to have a backup?

0:27:08	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_00
 Or do we just...

0:27:13	SPEAKER_01
 Back up really been necessary.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, will people just use the battery if there's no...

0:27:21	SPEAKER_00
 I think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy and...

0:27:28	SPEAKER_00
 Be bold and innovative and hope this works.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_00
 Well, hope that it works.

0:27:34	SPEAKER_00
 It's like no reason why it wouldn't work.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_00
 So I think we should just take advantage of...

0:27:40	SPEAKER_00
 Like using this to its full potential.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_00
 It could even be one of our selling points.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_01
 It could be fully kinetic energy.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_02
 Environmental touches.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_02
 So if it's not working, they just have to shake it a bit.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_01
 Absolutely.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_01
 All right, the next decision is chip on print.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_00
 I don't exactly know what that means.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_00
 It's whether we went for the simple, the regular, or the advanced chip and that linked in with what buttons we're going to have.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_01
 You're going for more simplistic style, right?

0:28:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_00
 But that was without the LCD.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_00
 So that means we're not doing the advanced.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_00
 So it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_01
 I think we decided on the push buttons, right?

0:28:23	SPEAKER_01
 So that's the simple...

0:28:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_01
 Would we need a more advanced one for the lighting, the interior lighting system?

0:28:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, possibly.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_00
 So it's probably going to be the regular chip that we're going to need.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_00
 So it's a medium.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_00
 So regular chip.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_00
 That's called a medium or regular?

0:28:37	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:28:40	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, it's regular, not simple.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_02
 I didn't.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, if we...

0:28:45	SPEAKER_00
 Because of the lighting that we've decided to put in the software.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, and cases.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_01
 So is this dependent on shape or what it's made of or what?

0:28:55	SPEAKER_00
 I think this is just going to be a very outside case, which we both decided on rubber?

0:29:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I guess plastic and rubber.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_01
 Coated and rubber.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_01
 Plastic rubber.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_01
 With rubber.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_01
 Coating and inter changeable.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_00
 Intertangible, yeah.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_00
 Still going for that.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_01
 Intertangible, please.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:29:24	SPEAKER_01
 User interface concept.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_01
 So is your time to shine?

0:29:29	SPEAKER_03
 We decided on the component.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_03
 I'm sorry, I lost my own part.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_03
 You're squint.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_03
 It's called command interface.

0:29:38	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_03
 The command interface.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_01
 The command interface.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_03
 The command line interface here.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_01
 The command line?

0:29:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:29:49	None
 Okay.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_01
 Line interface.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:29:56	SPEAKER_01
 And supplements.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_01
 What's that all about?

0:30:00	SPEAKER_03
 I think that is, well, we haven't really made any decisions about what we're going to do about the cluster of buttons, functions, colors, and forms, and consistent use.

0:30:13	SPEAKER_03
 Like, what are our ideas?

0:30:15	SPEAKER_03
 You come back these problems.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_03
 Different interfaces are very different and can be confusing because of the difference and the cause.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_03
 The different cluster of buttons that we have.

0:30:30	SPEAKER_03
 We haven't really decided what to do about that.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_01
 What are our choices here?

0:30:38	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it's just where shall we locate the buttons?

0:30:46	SPEAKER_03
 What kind of functions will it show we have?

0:30:50	SPEAKER_01
 We'll have the numbers of the channels and we'll have power.

0:30:53	SPEAKER_01
 The channel changer and volume and power.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_03
 So, just basic?

0:31:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if we should go into adjusting light levels, things like that because different televisions will have.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, tone, contrast, and things.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_02
 That was on one of my presentations about how often it was used.

0:31:16	SPEAKER_02
 Do you remember that?

0:31:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it was minimal.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it wasn't that I was hardly ever used.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_02
 Should I bring it up?

0:31:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_00
 It was told that this will come with a remote.

0:31:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and surely that would be quite specific to the individual television.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, well, we know we want numbers.

0:31:38	SPEAKER_02
 Screen settings was used 0.5 times an hour.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_02
 So, once every two hours.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_02
 And it was considered a 1.5 relevance on scale of 10.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_02
 And it was a brightness color.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_00
 I think most of that comes on the individual television itself, isn't it?

0:31:57	SPEAKER_00
 I'm sure it has its own buttons.

0:31:59	SPEAKER_00
 So, don't necessarily need to have it on remote.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_01
 And different televisions, I don't know if we can make a remote that will be universal to all the different kinds of things.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_00
 So, we're just going for power channels volume.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_02
 The other one was audio settings, mono stereo pitch.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, I sometimes use that.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_02
 Some TVs will have the option of living room style, movie style.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_02
 And they said that's used 0.8 times an hour, which is actually somewhat high.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_02
 Almost once an hour.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_02
 Relovance of two.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, we have five minutes to finish our media.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_01
 Correct.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:32:40	SPEAKER_01
 Let's just get this first.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that didn't come up on my name.

0:32:43	SPEAKER_01
 Have we have audio?

0:32:45	SPEAKER_01
 It only comes up on my name usually.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_03
 It would seem so if we could burn carbonating else, just have an audio button.

0:32:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I don't...

0:32:56	SPEAKER_01
 It's a problem with the international appeal.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_01
 I think if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_01
 But we know that everyone has this and it's the same.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_02
 I guess it affects the marketing.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_02
 It is a good sales point.

0:33:13	SPEAKER_02
 Aren't you annoyed with the wrong controls and have all these buttons?

0:33:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:33:17	SPEAKER_00
 This one has channel volume.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's it.

0:33:19	SPEAKER_00
 We can just go for it.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_01
 Make it a setting point that is just the base.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:24	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_01
 Brilliant.

0:33:26	SPEAKER_01
 Good.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_01
 And, okay, in closing, because we only have five minutes.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_01
 We'll be meeting again in 30 minutes.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_01
 You'll be working...

0:33:35	SPEAKER_01
 Probably we'll be working on the look and feel design.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_01
 Wait a minute.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_01
 And the user interface design, so this is where the trendy stuff comes in.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_01
 And you'll be evaluating the product.

0:33:49	SPEAKER_01
 Poppy and Tara will have to work together, see modeling clay.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_01
 And your personal coach will give you the rest of the information about the staff.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_01
 Alright, so anyone else has something to say?

0:34:03	SPEAKER_00
 I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect.

0:34:08	SPEAKER_00
 Are we seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research?

0:34:14	SPEAKER_00
 I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something, because...

0:34:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_00
 Even if that may not seem obvious to us, if that's what the surveys brought out, I think we should probably go along with that.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_00
 So I suppose that I'll come out in our design development, but happy to go ahead with the fruit.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_02
 Now, do you guys need one idea of how many...

0:34:35	SPEAKER_02
 Are you going to come up with casing ideas?

0:34:37	SPEAKER_02
 I'm different.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:39	SPEAKER_03
 We're not five.

0:34:40	SPEAKER_03
 What do you think of this?

0:34:43	SPEAKER_03
 Having the numbers, kind of like not a bunch of grapes, but you know, like purple and kind of in a triangle.

0:34:50	SPEAKER_03
 Like grape?

0:34:51	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, you can have some fun with the buttons.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's true.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_00
 We can have an affinity.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_02
 I guess ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well, so it's something that will appeal to the 15 to 25 year olds.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_02
 It's something that your granny would want on her remote control.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_02
 An international taste as well.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_00
 A lot of things to consider.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_00
 Lots of...

0:35:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:35:15	None
 Alright.

0:35:16	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we'll stick to the veggie theme then.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_01
 Alright.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_01
 And we'll reconvene in 30 minutes.

0:35:25	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:35:27	SPEAKER_01
 I'll see you later.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, what do I just do?

0:35:33	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.
