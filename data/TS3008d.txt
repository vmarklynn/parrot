 Dat is een signal.

0:05:41	SPEAKER_00
 En als je geen sepere en een andere button hebt, met in 5 seconden, dan de remote control is een signal voor Channel 1.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_00
 Nou, ik denk dat het werkt.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_02

0:07:39	SPEAKER_00
 Ja, ik heb het op de zeeroof.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_00
 Ja, ik denk dat.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_00
 Ja, voor nu, als we niet voorzien.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_01

0:07:55	SPEAKER_02
 Wat is het aan het verantwoord?

0:07:57	SPEAKER_00
 Het is een remote control dat een andere signal is.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_00
 Dat kan niet bevinden, maar ik denk dat het ultiefies in een soort way supporten is.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_00
 Ik weet niet.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_00
 Nee, ik denk dat het een beetje...

0:08:07	SPEAKER_00
 We zijn niet ook niet aan het verantwoord.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_00
 Ik denk dat het een beetje werkt, maar ik denk dat het een meer te zijn.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_03
 Een remote control dat een signal in een button is.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_00
 Ik denk dat het een soort...

0:08:21	SPEAKER_03
 Een soort televisie, als je het wilt gaan, dan 10.

0:08:25	SPEAKER_00
 De 1-werkt.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_00
 Nee, je moet een speciale...

0:08:29	SPEAKER_03
 Je moet een tv of meer signal.

0:08:31	SPEAKER_03
 Als je een button pressen, je wil een signal.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_03
 En de hele televisie moet meer signalen naar het hele hele tijd.

0:08:39	SPEAKER_03
 Maar...

0:08:41	SPEAKER_03
 Ja, oké, we gaan het.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_03
 Als je een technologie dat het wilt geeft meer signals, het goed werkt.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_03
 Het is een basic idea van de meest...

0:08:58	SPEAKER_03
 De meest common en simpel operatie op de remote.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_02
 Ik kan hem in de docking station.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_01
 Ja?

0:09:07	SPEAKER_01
 Ja.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_03
 Het is hier.

0:09:10	SPEAKER_03
 En...

0:09:13	SPEAKER_01
 Ja, er is geen...

0:09:17	SPEAKER_01
 Ik denk dat het een basic is.

0:09:20	SPEAKER_01
 Ja, het is geen 1 button.

0:09:22	SPEAKER_01
 Dat is een function.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_01
 Maar misschien kan we een 1-werkt.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_03
 Maar misschien kan we een docking station een beetje standen.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_03
 Voor de andere producten we zetten.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_03

0:10:09	SPEAKER_02
 Het heeft hetzelfde verhaal van de schapen, natuurlijk.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_02
 Ja, maar we kunnen...

0:10:15	SPEAKER_02
 De technologie en de verhaalde van dezelfde verhaalde, dat is het goed.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_02
 Maar als je hetzelfde van dezelfde producten hebt, dan...

0:10:22	SPEAKER_03
 We kunnen hetzelfde hetzelfde van dezelfde producten.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_03
 Ja, dat is het goed, maar...

0:10:29	SPEAKER_03
 Als de rechalder een beetje speelt, we kunnen hetzelfde op hetzelfde.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_03
 Ja, maar...

0:10:41	SPEAKER_02
 Het moet bevinden om de bevinden te zijn.

0:10:43	SPEAKER_02
 Het is niet zo'n geval.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_02
 Dat is een beetje...

0:10:47	SPEAKER_03
 Ik weet niet of je het niet kan maken, maar dan is het niet zo.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_02
 Maar als je hetzelfde van dezelfde producten hebt, dan...

0:10:54	SPEAKER_02
 maar dat is het de collectie aan het verbrel om dat ik dan wel conclude kijk...

0:11:02	SPEAKER_03
 maar als we het Gloria kl

0:11:17	SPEAKER_02
 ook we hebben. Oh, help.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_02
 Maar je kunt een beetje een hoog in het.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_03
 In de lille, een lille, een lille productie, die in het.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_00
 Dat is passant.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_00
 Let's talk about the docking station later, want we have to consider the docking station anyway, want we have some cost issues still to come.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_00
 We have to look.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_03
 The look and feel would be great on this remote control.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_03
 We pick up the remote control in the smallest area, then your left term of your right term is near the program button, which is the most common used function.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_03
 All the other buttons are available for your term.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_03
 So it's a really good design.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_03
 Is it?

0:12:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, on the side, there will be a strip of rubber.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_03
 In the middle, there is a hard material, a hard plastic with a light behind it.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_02
 And other lights?

0:12:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, we can make it also in the own lights on it.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_02
 Or the buttons that can make lights on it.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe the logo?

0:12:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:12:37	SPEAKER_03
 But it will also use batteries and we want you.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_00
 For now, this is good enough.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, what was on the, you know,

0:12:50	SPEAKER_03
 all the aspects of the interface buttons were...

0:12:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but oh yeah, the color, because we're going to use one color for the plastic, and one color for the rubber.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:13:03	SPEAKER_00
 And we're going to do the buttons, or we're going to have rubber buttons.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_00
 And there will be, don't be in the same color as the rubber on the side.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think that would be good.

0:13:12	SPEAKER_00
 I think we should use a darker color for the plastic and maybe some more brighter and flashier.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, maybe we can use on the light on the side.

0:13:21	SPEAKER_03
 We can use multiple lights.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_03
 So it will...

0:13:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we'll talk about the lights later.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_00
 Because it also depends on the costs and such.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_00
 And we have to grill upon the exact colors, but I don't know if that's important, but we'll talk about it later.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, for now, this is okay.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_00
 This is okay.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_00
 The next...

0:13:43	SPEAKER_00
 You're going to give a presentation too, or I have to see the...

0:13:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I'm going to do something right there.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_00
 Detailed design.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_02
 We've got to do that on the right...

0:13:53	SPEAKER_02
 the most...

0:13:54	SPEAKER_02
 the right mouse screen, because...

0:13:56	SPEAKER_00
 Evaluation criteria.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's me.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, all right.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_02
 I will be needing that image.

0:14:06	SPEAKER_02
 So, leave it please.

0:14:12	SPEAKER_02
 Go away.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_02
 Right, we're going to evaluate that design according to a few points.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_02
 The four of us are going to do that together.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_02
 I want to have a color over here.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_02
 Come on.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_02
 Right, the remote...

0:14:36	SPEAKER_02
 It's not ugly, a bit weird sentence, but the positive thing has to be on the left, so I said not ugly instead of ugly.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_02
 What would you say?

0:14:48	SPEAKER_02
 We've got to give points to all of these...

0:14:50	SPEAKER_02
 to evaluate that design, and please forget the drawing skills of these guys.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_02
 The remote controls are not ugly.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_02
 How do you feel?

0:15:03	SPEAKER_00
 I think four maybe would be appropriate, because it's...

0:15:07	SPEAKER_00
 maybe it really depends on taste.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it's kind of dairy-our-design.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_00
 So, maybe a lot of people find it really ugly, and other people find it really cool.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know, or...

0:15:19	SPEAKER_00
 How do you think?

0:15:20	SPEAKER_03
 I think the front...

0:15:22	SPEAKER_03
 The front will give it a more...

0:15:25	SPEAKER_03
 less, uglier side, because you can make it in your own...

0:15:31	SPEAKER_03
 The difference in your own...

0:15:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, you can make it in your own...

0:15:34	SPEAKER_03
 More to your own personality or house style.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_00
 We didn't...

0:15:39	SPEAKER_00
 We were not planning to use fronts.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_00
 No, not fronts, but different designs.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_02
 And that's still...

0:15:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's a little personal touch, I guess.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_00
 No, maybe we should do three or something in our...

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 What would you like to say?

0:15:54	SPEAKER_02
 Personally.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_02
 Personally.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_01
 We can make it a one.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, but what is it?

0:16:01	SPEAKER_03
 I think two or three...

0:16:04	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_02
 You don't?

0:16:06	SPEAKER_01
 I agree.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_01
 Two or three?

0:16:09	SPEAKER_01
 I go for the positive, so I go for two.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_02
 I was thinking about three.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_00
 I was thinking about four, so I think three is...

0:16:17	SPEAKER_02
 Three is a bit...

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 How?

0:16:22	SPEAKER_02
 What am I doing?

0:16:23	SPEAKER_02
 I'll mark it.

0:16:25	SPEAKER_02
 Remote controls...

0:16:27	SPEAKER_02
 And then makes a stepping easy.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_00
 Well, let's make it a one.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, one.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_01
 One, thank you, agree?

0:16:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I agree.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_01
 This one, I think, for sure.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not using the ability, so...

0:16:38	SPEAKER_02
 I totally agree.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_02
 Remote controls...

0:16:40	SPEAKER_02
 The remote controls, relevant buttons, are prominently visible.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_00
 Two or one, I guess.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_00
 It's something we really put work into.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_02
 I would say one because...

0:16:52	SPEAKER_02
 It's all about buttons.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_02
 Every button is relevant.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_02
 And they're all...

0:16:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_02
 That's a one.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_02
 You agree?

0:17:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_02
 I think we totally succeeded there.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_00
 Well, maybe a two because of the menu...

0:17:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, maybe not.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_03
 Also the buttons of the one, the two, the digits...

0:17:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we don't know if they're there.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_00
 They're used...

0:17:20	SPEAKER_00
 It's got a point.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_00
 I think it too.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, true.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, it's three.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_00
 It came a long way, but not we didn't.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_00
 Two.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_03
 But you can't make a remote control without them.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_02
 No, that's true.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_02
 That's true.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_02
 They're definitely needed.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_00
 It can also always be more simplistic.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_00
 We put it on a tool.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control has got a really trendy look.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_03
 One.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_03
 Martin.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_00
 Well.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_00
 I think two.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_00
 It's hard to say from this picture.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_03
 We've tried to make it the best trend you've ever.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_02
 Ever.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_02
 He know.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_00
 But I do think it's more...

0:17:59	SPEAKER_01
 I'll make it a three because...

0:18:01	SPEAKER_00
 I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I agree.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_02
 So I think maybe it has to score higher on this than on the...

0:18:08	SPEAKER_02
 I was planning to give it a two where I give the not ugly...

0:18:11	SPEAKER_02
 The three.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_02
 Oh.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_02
 That's true.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_02
 You agree or not, too?

0:18:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_00
 When you compare to that.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_02
 Great.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_02
 Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unlimited buttons.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_00
 It's a different thing.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_02
 I can't be that one.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_02
 Well, forget that.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_02
 Go away.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_02
 Remote control has got innovative technology implanted.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_02
 No, no.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_01
 Where you not.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_01
 Well, maybe the LCD.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but we're...

0:18:44	SPEAKER_00
 You don't mean the rubber stuff.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and the light.

0:18:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but the light.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_00
 That's not innovative.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_00
 And I don't know if there's also re-not innovative.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_02
 Light is not...

0:18:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's not.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_00
 Seven?

0:18:55	SPEAKER_00
 No, six.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_00
 Well, seven maybe.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_00
 No, six.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_02
 Why not seven?

0:18:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_03
 Why not seven?

0:19:01	SPEAKER_03
 Because we've tried to make it a little bit innovative.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_03
 But how?

0:19:05	SPEAKER_00
 It depends on the...

0:19:07	SPEAKER_03
 With the light, it's kind of future...

0:19:09	SPEAKER_00
 No, I think it's actually seven maybe.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_00
 But there's nothing innovative about it.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_02
 It's true.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_02
 I agree.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_03
 But still, you can retrieve it when it's gone.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_03
 With...

0:19:20	SPEAKER_02
 With generally or...

0:19:22	SPEAKER_02
 You didn't draw the original form.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_02
 No, the doggy station is...

0:19:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I mean the doggy station.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_00
 But I think...

0:19:29	SPEAKER_00
 It's a part of the remote doggy station.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_00
 It's going to be a problem.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_00
 And when the speaker is on the...

0:19:35	SPEAKER_00
 Well, let's leave it open for us later to see.

0:19:38	SPEAKER_00
 But because we have to re-value it anyway.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_00
 Well, yeah.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_02
 No, well, the agenda says it's value-weight now.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_02
 So I think...

0:19:45	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, for now it's a six or a seven or a six maybe.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_00
 But the retrieval or the...

0:19:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but I don't know if it's very...

0:19:52	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's very innovative for our control.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_03
 How would you innovate a remote control more?

0:19:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, more through like...

0:20:00	SPEAKER_00
 TV function add- To put it on your head?

0:20:03	SPEAKER_00
 No, you know what I mean.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_00
 You must be innovative technology for remote control more...

0:20:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, sure.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_00
...in how you control stuff, not in how you find your...

0:20:12	SPEAKER_00
 I definitely don't think it's a five.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_00
 Let's think about it later on.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control is easy to use.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, as a one or a two, at least.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_02
 I think a two, yeah.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it's good.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_02
 More on.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control hasn't got...

0:20:29	SPEAKER_00
 I want to see that one before.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_00
 How do you skip one?

0:20:32	SPEAKER_02
 I've just filled...

0:20:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_02
 That way.

0:20:36	SPEAKER_03
 You like the buttons?

0:20:38	SPEAKER_02
 I've found 12 questions so much, but it's still a...

0:20:41	SPEAKER_00
 The remote control will be bought by...

0:20:43	SPEAKER_02
 It will be bought by people under the age of 14.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, definitely.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_03
 In comparing with people of...

0:20:51	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no, no, no, just if they buy it.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we don't know.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, what do you think?

0:20:57	SPEAKER_01
 I think too.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_01
 I think too.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not talking too.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, too.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_03
 But only when you compare it with elderly.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_03
 There's no comparison.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_00
 There's no comparison.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_00
 It's just...

0:21:07	SPEAKER_00
 It will be bought by people under the age of 14.

0:21:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you can be very...

0:21:12	SPEAKER_00
 And I don't need to be guessing.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_00
 I just made it.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_03
 We'll make it a two.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_03
 When it succeeds, it can get a two...

0:21:20	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control has recognizable corporate image.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_02
 Color, logo or slogan.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_00
 Slogan is quite obvious in there.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_02
 All the slogan?

0:21:33	SPEAKER_00
 Sorry, no, no, no, no, the slogan.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_00
 You can put that on the side if we would like.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_03
 On the next side.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_03
 Encrypted.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_03
 And I will...

0:21:42	SPEAKER_00
 I'm gonna do this.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_00
 I still think it's gonna be a two or three.

0:21:45	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe a three this time.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_02
 Three?

0:21:48	SPEAKER_02
 I agree.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_02
 Because of the slogan in there.

0:21:52	SPEAKER_02
 Remote control's got a basic design intended for no...

0:21:55	SPEAKER_00
 It's a one or two.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_02
 Two.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_02
 Two?

0:21:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, make it two.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_00
 Two.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_02
 We've got to add up this course now to see our total average...

0:22:07	SPEAKER_02
 Four, five, seven, nine.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_02
 Look at that.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_02
 15, 17, 21, 24, 26.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_02
 26.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_02
 It's a 2.6.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_00
 Not that bad.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's mostly...

0:22:28	SPEAKER_00
 When we score higher on innovative technology, we would score it too.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_00
 Which is quite a great...

0:22:36	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_00
 This was the evaluation.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_02
 This was my evaluation.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_00
 Because I still think that the most important part of this meeting still has...

0:22:44	SPEAKER_02
 It's pretty nice job.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_02
 Until now.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_02
 Is this your...

0:22:50	SPEAKER_02
 Is this something after this meeting?

0:22:54	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I think we've got to fill out another question now.

0:22:57	None
 Okay.

0:22:58	None
 Yeah.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_00
 It's still open, do I know?

0:23:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, finance.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_00
 Because I received a spreadsheet.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but I actually don't need this presentation.

0:23:22	SPEAKER_00
 That's not a matter.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to open the spreadsheet and we're going to work this out together.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_00
 Because I didn't really finish it.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_00
 But we will see we'll stumble upon some problems.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_02
 We'll probably walk.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_00
 We'll look for it.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_00
 I'm probably already opened it here.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_00
 Let's try it again.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_00
 First of all, all the docking stations and costs and such are not included in this list.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_00
 But let's start with the need.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_00
 We include one battery.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_00
 I'll explain the components.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_00
 Our list is over here.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_00
 The price is given.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_00
 We...

0:24:14	SPEAKER_00
 The amount, yeah.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we indicate the amount of components.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_00
 The specific component, how much we need of them.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_00
 And then, don't watch the number yet.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if it's filled in properly.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, we need one battery.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_00
 One battery.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_00
 I think we're going to use enough.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_00
 We don't need connectics, solar cells, hand on ammo.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, this is the first problem.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_00
 I think we should know how many simple chips, regular chips...

0:24:43	SPEAKER_03
...is one chip, but what you have to choose one for it.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_03
 But a simple chip is enough, I think.

0:24:53	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_03
 With the lights in the retrieval, we can be...

0:24:56	SPEAKER_02
 I haven't got an idea on which we need to use.

0:25:00	SPEAKER_00
 I think it was your job in the first meet, your first presentation to make this clear.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_00
 But then you had some time problems.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_00
 But do you know what chip we need?

0:25:13	SPEAKER_03
 The email I got said, simple chip, when we put in the speaker and the retriever device, it will cost a bit more, like I think the advanced chip, maybe.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_02
 And how do you know?

0:25:32	SPEAKER_02
 You got that email.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you can look it up right now.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_03
 I didn't know about the retriever or...

0:25:40	SPEAKER_00
 When we leave the retriever in such a site, it would be a simple chip.

0:25:46	SPEAKER_00
 And with the retriever, it would be an advanced chip.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_02
 I'd point out the advanced chip for now, I guess.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_00
 That would be enough for a future recommendation.

0:25:57	SPEAKER_00
 There will be a lot of problems.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_00
 The simple sensor, simple speaker.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_00
 Is that the speaker?

0:26:04	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know what it is.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, we went for the double curved case, made out of plastic and rubber.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_00
 And with a special color.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_00
 I guess that's what we were.

0:26:24	SPEAKER_01
 Well, special color.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I don't know about the special color.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_03
 Otherwise, you can't stand the plastic color.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think we have a special color.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_02
 Stand the rubber.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, then the push button.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_00
 I was just counting them.

0:26:36	SPEAKER_00
 I think you have to indicate the amount of push buttons we want to use.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yes.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that's a bit of a problem.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_00
 But I really don't understand that.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_00
 Because I can imagine a remote control with far more push buttons.

0:26:50	SPEAKER_00
 And it wouldn't be possible according to this sheet.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_01
 The simplest buttons.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's only when you use push buttons, it will cost that much.

0:27:02	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think so.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_02
 If you use a scroll wheel.

0:27:04	SPEAKER_02
 A mount.

0:27:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the yellow row is the amount.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_00
 You're in the number of components you plan to use in the five.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_00
 So the total cost.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it's the kind of push buttons.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_03
 You can have four kinds of push buttons.

0:27:15	SPEAKER_03
 Rubber.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_01
 You can have one or is that nine?

0:27:20	SPEAKER_00
 And I count them like this.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_00
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_00
 You have 12 and 13 because this is one.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, 12.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, then it will be 18.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_00
 Because I rated them as a.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_00
 This is a report.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:27:40	SPEAKER_00
 And I think that.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_00
 I think that.

0:27:42	SPEAKER_00
 Plus the mute button.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_00
 And it will be 18.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_02
 18.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_02
 One, two, three, four, five.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_03
 Why is that so expensive?

0:27:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I don't understand.

0:27:52	SPEAKER_00
 I don't get the point because it would be.

0:27:55	SPEAKER_00
 So relatively so expensive.

0:27:57	SPEAKER_00
 Just these small buttons.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_01
 Is it cents?

0:28:01	SPEAKER_01
 The 50 cents of butter.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_02
 Or one single stupid button.

0:28:05	SPEAKER_02
 So when you.

0:28:06	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, let's make it just one.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_03
 It's 80% of the price of the.

0:28:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, now it's now it's already.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, exactly.

0:28:14	SPEAKER_00
 Sure, we just.

0:28:16	SPEAKER_00
 Give our own interpretation to it because else we would really have a problem.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_00
 It would be impossible to make it.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_02
 I couldn't understand it if it was 50 cents per.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_02
 And per button.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_03
 When you have the same amount of button, you have to put it in a carton.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_00
 And that's what is then this.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_00
 Isn't possible.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_00
 This is the most simple.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it is possible.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_00
 But we've never seen one before.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_03
 I've seen one remote control.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, without the numbers.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, only with the.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_03
 Page up, page down.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, but I wouldn't want to own that.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_02
 That's.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_02
 It's still for little children.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_03
 They can handle that remote control.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but it takes would also be impossible.

0:28:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, it's for it's just for a little.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, we'll just.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but then still when we.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_00
 There is no room for a darkening station or something.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see, we have a button supplements.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_00
 We'll give the button a special color.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_00
 We'll give them a special form.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_00
 I think we should mark the special form thing because this will be some special form.

0:29:16	SPEAKER_00
 St. Corporated in these big buttons, I guess.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_00
 Because the buttons will be that will be matching color between the buttons and the rubber surroundings.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's what they mean by a special color.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_00
 Why is it?

0:29:30	SPEAKER_00
 I think all the special color things have to be marked over here because that's what we were planning to do making it.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_03
 Special form also.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, special material also because there's rubber and the buttons have to be rubber.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_03
 What is the normal material?

0:29:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:29:47	SPEAKER_01
 Classic, I think.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_03
 Classic.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_03
 Classic.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but the problem now is that there's no such thing as a darkening station in this list.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_00
 But we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a darkening station for 30 cents.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_03
 But we can sell the remote control and sell the darkening station separately.

0:30:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, no.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_03
 We don't have to tell it, but what we can say can almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the darkening station.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_00
 Never mind, I do like that idea.

0:30:28	SPEAKER_00
 But then the darkening station isn't relevant for this project anymore when we come.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_03
 No, but then why should we still have to use it?

0:30:35	SPEAKER_00
 We have to find out what chip we need.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I really don't get it.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_02
 I think we can all go this way.

0:30:43	SPEAKER_00
 I think a special color thing has to be marked.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_00
 Because I think we...

0:30:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:30:49	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think that's what they...

0:30:51	SPEAKER_03
 But for two euros and 30 cents we don't get a darkening station.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:30:56	SPEAKER_00
 But can we find out about the chips?

0:30:58	SPEAKER_00
 Because when we don't need a darkening station then probably we also need a simple chip.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_01
 And then we can get a nice...

0:31:07	SPEAKER_00
 Then we can do something extra.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_00
 But still it's going to get more expensive with a simple...

0:31:13	SPEAKER_00
 And we have some money left.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_00
 We can put...

0:31:16	SPEAKER_00
 Then for two euros...

0:31:17	SPEAKER_00
 We can put a scroll wheel on it.

0:31:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we'll... who knows?

0:31:22	SPEAKER_02
 Ah, why?

0:31:23	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, a bit of titanium.

0:31:24	SPEAKER_02
 If it would cost two euros, I had a total thing and it would be nice too.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, we're not going to add...

0:31:30	SPEAKER_02
 But what...

0:31:31	SPEAKER_00
 What can we do?

0:31:32	SPEAKER_00
 How are we going to do the kinetic cells?

0:31:34	SPEAKER_00
 That's also maybe an idea.

0:31:35	SPEAKER_01
 So what can we do with a simple chip?

0:31:37	SPEAKER_01
 What's different with the regular chip?

0:31:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's what it is to find out.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you can find it in your email right now.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_00
 And we know...

0:31:43	SPEAKER_00
 And we exactly know what it will cost us.

0:31:46	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe it's that... that's nice to know.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_01
 Correct your chip.

0:31:51	SPEAKER_01
 Because we don't have special functions to use...

0:31:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but when we...

0:31:55	SPEAKER_01
 A palm chip, for example, on the hand in normal.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_00
 But when we skip...

0:31:58	SPEAKER_00
 When we don't use the...

0:32:02	SPEAKER_00
 So we're not going to make the docking station.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_00
 Then we still...

0:32:06	SPEAKER_00
 And we need something else, maybe, to make it kind of special.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_00
 Because that was our special function.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_02
 You can make a plain docking station for two euros.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_00
 We'll go back...

0:32:15	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, you can also do the...

0:32:16	SPEAKER_00
 But...

0:32:17	SPEAKER_00
 Without the recharge...

0:32:18	SPEAKER_00
 It still is a special remote control.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_00
 You know, it's for a special one.

0:32:23	SPEAKER_02
 But we can make a docking station for two euros.

0:32:25	SPEAKER_02
 If you don't put the recharge function in it.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, it has a shape.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but of course, we have two euros.

0:32:34	SPEAKER_00
 And we still...

0:32:35	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we have to use the advanced chip.

0:32:37	SPEAKER_00
 And two euros isn't even possible.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_02
 Why should that not be possible?

0:32:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because then we...

0:32:45	SPEAKER_00
 Three cents left.

0:32:47	SPEAKER_02
 Now, for the docking station, if you choose a simple chip.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but...

0:32:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I don't know, because maybe...

0:32:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we'll find out what it's saying.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_01
 If we're doing...

0:32:59	SPEAKER_01
 Do we need an advanced chip?

0:33:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and we are...

0:33:02	SPEAKER_00
 And what is this?

0:33:03	SPEAKER_00
 A sample sample.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know if it's a...

0:33:06	SPEAKER_03
 It isn't in my information.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_03
 I've got a...

0:33:11	SPEAKER_03
 A schematic view of the remote control.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_03
 But nothing about advanced chips or...

0:33:18	SPEAKER_00
 Let's...

0:33:20	SPEAKER_00
 You can look at it for presentation.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_00
 Technical functions?

0:33:27	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_01
 I've got the error...

0:33:29	SPEAKER_03
 I will put a page on it.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_03
 When my mouse works again.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_03
 My mouse is...

0:33:52	SPEAKER_03
 Dead.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_02
 Reanimated.

0:33:55	SPEAKER_02
 Dead.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_03
 Ah, I forgot it.

0:34:00	SPEAKER_03
 I will put my email on the...

0:34:04	SPEAKER_03
...network.

0:34:14	SPEAKER_02
 What the hell are these?

0:34:16	SPEAKER_03
 It's on it.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_02
 What a...

0:34:20	SPEAKER_01
 Here it's open.

0:34:24	None
 I don't think here is in here already.

0:34:54	None
 There's only just...

0:35:04	SPEAKER_01
 Something about...

0:35:06	SPEAKER_01
 There's nothing about...

0:35:08	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_01
 At the end of the work...

0:35:11	SPEAKER_01
 There's an infrared LED.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_00
 And in the presentation of yours, there was also something about different components.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_00
 Which one was it?

0:35:21	SPEAKER_00
 Fictional requirements?

0:35:24	SPEAKER_02
 No, that was my first one.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_01
 Components designed maybe.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, that was mine.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, that was the second one.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_03
 But that was my second.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it was my second.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_00
 Your first presentation.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_02
 It's at the bottom.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_02
 Where it comes from?

0:35:41	SPEAKER_02
 It's at your taskbar.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but it's the other one.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_01
 This is not a work in design or components.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_00
 Not the right one.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_02
 I don't...

0:35:53	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, sorry.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_00
 No, this is the other one.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe something is...

0:36:00	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe there's something about...

0:36:02	SPEAKER_00
 In these chipset?

0:36:06	SPEAKER_03
 This is the same...

0:36:09	SPEAKER_03
 This is only the possibilities.

0:36:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_03
 We can use a simple regular or advanced chip.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, nice.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_00
 You know that a push button requires a simple chip, but a scroll wheel...

0:36:27	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_00
 The regular tool is the hybrid.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so we only need a simple chip.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_03
 With a light.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_01
 Little light.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but that's just the same as the...

0:36:39	SPEAKER_00
 No, this is a simple chip.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_00
 The scroll wheel...

0:36:45	SPEAKER_00
 It only states that the scroll wheel requires a regular chip, and that a display requires an advanced chip.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_02
 This play is, of course, a version of that.

0:36:54	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think that...

0:36:57	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_02
 Just a little light.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_01
 I think a normal, simple chip, will be okay.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_01
 I agree.

0:37:04	SPEAKER_00
 And what's the simple sensor slash simple speaker?

0:37:09	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you can say against remote page...

0:37:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:15	SPEAKER_03
 Page up page down.

0:37:16	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I guess so too.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_01
 That's not what we want.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we might want it, but...

0:37:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_00
 All in 12 euros...

0:37:28	SPEAKER_03
 Back to the car.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_03
 12 euros and 50 cents.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_03
 We're going to use a simple chip.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_02
 Great.

0:37:36	SPEAKER_02
 The lead.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_03
 And the lights.

0:37:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, there's no...

0:37:41	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, they're free, I guess.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_02
 Get a glory.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_00
 No, there is so many left to be spent.

0:37:49	SPEAKER_01
 Can we do it?

0:37:51	SPEAKER_02
 We think we can make a down here.

0:37:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but what we have to think about now is that...

0:37:55	SPEAKER_00
 Is this still a special remote control?

0:37:59	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it hasn't got any innovative technology.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_00
 We're not going to apply any innovative technology anyway, I think.

0:38:09	SPEAKER_00
 I don't see any possibility to do so because it wouldn't fit our...

0:38:14	SPEAKER_00
 The original philosophy.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_00
 But is there some extra...

0:38:18	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something instead of the rechargeable...

0:38:24	SPEAKER_00
 The rechargeable thing was something to...

0:38:27	SPEAKER_00
 So people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe if we put the kinetic thing in...

0:38:34	SPEAKER_00
 But sometimes you put it...

0:38:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I know, but still they will think about that.

0:38:40	SPEAKER_00
 I mean...

0:38:41	SPEAKER_03
 Canetics are now the only use in watches.

0:38:44	SPEAKER_00
 It's made for us people.

0:38:46	SPEAKER_00
 If it was a useless technology, they wouldn't put it as a possibility.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_00
 A solar system, I use this.

0:38:53	SPEAKER_00
 The targets group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of thinking.

0:39:03	SPEAKER_00
 Because I think when there was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic power source, then it would be this one.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_00
 Because it gets thrown around a lot and gets used a lot.

0:39:21	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe that's a cool thing about it.

0:39:24	SPEAKER_00
 You know, you don't use batteries.

0:39:26	SPEAKER_00
 I've never seen it before in a remote control.

0:39:29	SPEAKER_01
 Then we can make a docking station.

0:39:33	SPEAKER_02
 Five minutes.

0:39:34	SPEAKER_00
 No, we can't make a docking station anyway.

0:39:37	SPEAKER_02
 That's not true.

0:39:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we can also...

0:39:39	SPEAKER_00
 We can make a docking station.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_00
 Why not?

0:39:42	SPEAKER_01
 Look at now.

0:39:43	SPEAKER_01
 We got two...

0:39:44	SPEAKER_01
 Two-thirty.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_01
 Two-thirty left.

0:39:46	SPEAKER_01
 We can't get an exact docking station.

0:39:48	SPEAKER_03
 We can make a docking station with a cable, with buttons on it.

0:39:51	SPEAKER_03
 Sure.

0:39:52	SPEAKER_03
 With retrieval, dividing it.

0:39:54	SPEAKER_02
 The power device is very cheap.

0:39:56	SPEAKER_02
 That's just a regular power cable.

0:39:58	SPEAKER_00
 It would be serious.

0:39:59	SPEAKER_00
 Then the docking station would be...

0:40:01	SPEAKER_00
 With a button, the price of the remote control.

0:40:04	SPEAKER_03
 With a button to retrieve it, so it will beep.

0:40:08	SPEAKER_03
 So it's wireless.

0:40:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but we don't...

0:40:11	SPEAKER_00
 We haven't looked at the discourse of the speaker and other stuff.

0:40:17	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think it's realistically to do so.

0:40:20	SPEAKER_02
 Well, then it's useless project.

0:40:22	SPEAKER_02
 Look at the case.

0:40:23	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, because we...

0:40:24	SPEAKER_03
 The case of a...

0:40:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, then we don't have to...

0:40:27	SPEAKER_00
 Look at all these special stuff we have.

0:40:30	SPEAKER_00
 The colors are special.

0:40:31	SPEAKER_00
 The form is special.

0:40:32	SPEAKER_00
 It's this whole concept.

0:40:34	SPEAKER_00
 And maybe with the kinetic thing, I think we could do a compromise with the kinetic thing.

0:40:39	SPEAKER_02
 Can we say 15 euros?

0:40:41	SPEAKER_02
 No, it's the...

0:40:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I mean...

0:40:43	SPEAKER_03
 No, then we have to sell it for 30 euros.

0:40:46	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:40:47	SPEAKER_02
 No, we already make less profit of it.

0:40:51	SPEAKER_02
 You can sell for 27.5.

0:40:54	SPEAKER_02
 Then you make as much profit as you would with 12.5 production costs.

0:40:59	SPEAKER_00
 My suggestion is just forget about the whole talking station thing and make it like...

0:41:06	SPEAKER_00
 I still...

0:41:07	SPEAKER_00
 I also feel this concept of making it kinetic.

0:41:11	SPEAKER_00
 Because of the...

0:41:12	SPEAKER_00
 You know, it gives something dynamic to the remote control.

0:41:15	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we can do both in the remote.

0:41:18	SPEAKER_03
 Battery and kinetic.

0:41:20	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:41:21	SPEAKER_00
 No, that wouldn't...

0:41:23	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:41:24	SPEAKER_02
 1320.

0:41:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and it is also not a good...

0:41:29	SPEAKER_00
 And I think that...

0:41:30	SPEAKER_00
 You really do it only kinetic.

0:41:31	SPEAKER_00
 You don't want to think about batteries anymore.

0:41:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, but only kinetic.

0:41:34	SPEAKER_00
 No, no.

0:41:35	SPEAKER_03
 Then you have to shake it.

0:41:36	SPEAKER_03
 And oh, when it's empty.

0:41:38	SPEAKER_03
 It's great.

0:41:39	SPEAKER_02
 It's great.

0:41:40	SPEAKER_02
 Throw it through the room like 20 times an hour.

0:41:42	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no, no.

0:41:43	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no.

0:41:44	SPEAKER_00
 It's very sophisticated, not only the technology.

0:41:46	SPEAKER_00
 When you...

0:41:47	SPEAKER_00
 You're remote like once a day or maybe even less.

0:41:50	SPEAKER_03
 No, that's not true.

0:41:52	SPEAKER_03
 A watch is kinetic.

0:41:54	SPEAKER_03
 Because you walk all the time.

0:41:55	SPEAKER_00
 We can make it.

0:41:56	SPEAKER_00
 No, we can...

0:41:57	SPEAKER_00
 But the remote control gets...

0:41:58	SPEAKER_00
 Why do they state that this technology can't be used to it?

0:42:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, solar cells are also stated.

0:42:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but a calculator also works on solar cells.

0:42:07	SPEAKER_03
 Why are you...

0:42:08	SPEAKER_03
 You solar cells, then.

0:42:10	SPEAKER_00
 Because I think the whole dynamic part...

0:42:13	SPEAKER_00
 It appeals to me thinking of our design philosophy, you know, with the rubber parts and...

0:42:19	SPEAKER_00
 Sturdiness of the thing and when you move it around a lot, then people find the idea funny.

0:42:24	SPEAKER_00
 And when I move my remote control around them.

0:42:26	SPEAKER_02
 That's true.

0:42:27	SPEAKER_02
 It's funny for a week.

0:42:28	SPEAKER_02
 I guess something like that, where you have to move it around very frequently.

0:42:32	SPEAKER_02
 Is the moment...

0:42:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but you don't have to.

0:42:35	SPEAKER_00
 Trust me, the idea of this technology is that you don't think about it just happens.

0:42:40	SPEAKER_02
 No, I don't move my...

0:42:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, we don't have to do it.

0:42:44	SPEAKER_00
 But what...

0:42:45	SPEAKER_00
 That we just have a lack of key futures.

0:42:47	SPEAKER_00
 You have to put something on your box to make people buy it.

0:42:51	SPEAKER_00
 We can't really do the docking thing.

0:42:55	SPEAKER_00
 It's not...

0:42:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we can do it, but it would be easy way out.

0:42:59	SPEAKER_03
 You can do it for 50 cents.

0:43:01	SPEAKER_02
 We've got more than 50 cents.

0:43:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, but we have to do...

0:43:06	SPEAKER_00
 The case alone is...

0:43:07	SPEAKER_00
 It's only a familiar left or something.

0:43:09	SPEAKER_03
 The case alone for a remote control is at least one euro.

0:43:12	SPEAKER_03
 Then we have one euro, 30, for the whole docking station.

0:43:16	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, we can leave it on bad...

0:43:20	SPEAKER_00
 Then our concept is ready.

0:43:23	SPEAKER_01
 Keep remote control.

0:43:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we make some extra profit on that.

0:43:32	SPEAKER_02
 No, we bond.

0:43:34	SPEAKER_02
 But that's...

0:43:35	SPEAKER_02
 No, it won't sell, but...

0:43:38	SPEAKER_02
 Any ideas?

0:43:40	SPEAKER_02
 Of course not.

0:43:41	SPEAKER_03
 Great, is he?

0:43:45	SPEAKER_03
 It's great.

0:43:47	SPEAKER_01
 We just have to go all what we did today again.

0:43:51	SPEAKER_01
 We have to do it over.

0:43:53	SPEAKER_02
 We'll come back tomorrow, okay?

0:43:55	SPEAKER_00
 No, there's still some concepts and some special left.

0:43:59	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it's going to excel in the field of design and looks and feel.

0:44:07	SPEAKER_00
 That's what makes it special.

0:44:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and I would like...

0:44:15	SPEAKER_00
 I would have liked the kinetic part as well to give it some...

0:44:18	SPEAKER_00
 Just to give it some extra special future.

0:44:21	SPEAKER_00
 I know it will work.

0:44:23	SPEAKER_00
 They're not putting technology on this list if it was impossible to...

0:44:28	SPEAKER_00
 To make it happen.

0:44:30	SPEAKER_03
 Why not a hand, I don't know, then.

0:44:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but we'll leave like this.

0:44:37	SPEAKER_00
 Then it's...

0:44:38	SPEAKER_02
 We can't do anything else.

0:44:42	SPEAKER_03
 We're done.

0:44:47	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, is this it?

0:44:49	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to...

0:44:51	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, we'll put the last sheet.

0:44:53	SPEAKER_02
 Now we can't.

0:44:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we have to...

0:45:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, yes, celebration.

0:45:05	SPEAKER_02
 I don't see why, but...

0:45:08	SPEAKER_02
 I think we've got to fill out another questioner to be honest.

0:45:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah?

0:45:12	SPEAKER_02
 I don't hear a bell.

0:45:14	None
 No, not yet.

0:45:19	SPEAKER_04
 All right, I'll see you guys in a minute.

0:45:22	SPEAKER_02
 Bye.

0:45:23	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think so.

0:45:25	SPEAKER_02
 Can we do it here?

0:45:26	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:45:27	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think so.

0:45:38	SPEAKER_03
 Just fill that one in.

0:45:44	SPEAKER_01
 Now we're doing now.

0:45:54	SPEAKER_01
 But it's all in your room.

0:45:56	None
 So there are two more questions.

0:45:59	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, okay.

0:46:02	SPEAKER_01
 Nice.

0:46:32	None
 We're done.
