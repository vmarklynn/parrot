0:00:00	SPEAKER_00
 Welcome back.

0:00:27	SPEAKER_00
 I hope you had a good lunch together.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_00
 This meeting the main agenda to discuss about the conceptual design meeting.

0:00:47	SPEAKER_00
 And the agenda will be the opening and that's the product manager or secretary that's me and the presentations from the Christine and Agnes and Pernamishri Ed.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_00
 Finally in this meeting we have to decide and we have to take a decision on the remote control concepts and the functional design.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_00
 So we have 40 minutes.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's a little bit low but I hope we can finish it up.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_00
 So I'll hand out to the functional team to the Christine to discuss about the components concept.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_02
 Okay so if you could open the PowerPoint presentation I'm number 2.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_02
 So, can we put it in slide show mode?

0:02:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, please.

0:02:13	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_02
 So we were looking specifically at the components, the following components, the case, the power supply, the means of communications with the television set.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_02
 And then since we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition you have to have a microphone, well no you don't actually have to have a microphone in the device but maybe you do have a way, it has to hear the speaker and so it could be in the television set, it could be in the device but somewhere you have to put the microphone and a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it gets lost.

0:03:08	SPEAKER_02
 So the other thing that we, our method for going about this is we've looked at the historical record, what's worked, what hasn't.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_02
 And then we also wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because of course we might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies capabilities to offer us.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_02
 So this is the approach that we took during our research.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_02
 So for the case we told, we were making a specific assumption that it would be curved in design.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_02
 Of course you know I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable but that doesn't seem to be one of the choice, not an option we can really seriously explore.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_02
 So then we were thinking about rubber but unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat factor and there might be some problems with how it goes with the board.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_02
 And then plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle, it gets brittle after a while so still had titanium and wood available but unfortunately titanium has also been eliminated.

0:04:36	SPEAKER_02
 The people in manufacturing said that it couldn't make curved cases out of titanium although how Apple did it with the power book I'm not quite sure but nevertheless they've eliminated all of our options except wood.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_02
 So this is my finding and as she said it's an environmentally friendly material.

0:04:59	SPEAKER_02
 So we're currently proposing, we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_02
 So then there's this other matter of the chips and well you could use a simple design on the board but these simple chips but that's only works for the buttons.

0:05:14	SPEAKER_02
 You don't get very much intelligence with this simple one.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_02
 And then there was the regular which I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_02
 The other option was this advanced chip on print and we found that it includes this infrared sender which remember the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_02
 And manufacturing has told us that they've recently developed a sensor and a speaker that would be integrated into this advanced chip on print.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_02
 So we're now jumping right to our personal preferences.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_02
 I'd really think we should use some of some really exotic woods like well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kind of think of some trees and some nice woods.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_02
 I think that people might really want to design their own cases.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_02
 You see they could do sort of a three dimensional design on the internet and then they could submit their orders kind of like you submit a custom car order you know and you can choose the color and the size of the wheels and the colors of the leather and things like that.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_02
 And then I think we should go with the solar cells as well as the microphone and speaker on the advanced chip.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_02
 So this is the findings of our research and my recommendations for the new remote control would be to have to be made out of wood.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_02
 Do you have any problems with that?

0:06:56	SPEAKER_00
 Can you go back one slide?

0:06:59	SPEAKER_02
 I'm not sure.

0:07:00	SPEAKER_02
 Well I know let's see.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_02
 Let's go back up here.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_00
 Question.

0:07:06	SPEAKER_00
 What's mean exactly it wants a chip on print.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_00
 What's the meaning of that?

0:07:11	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's a multiple chip design and it's maybe printed onto the circuit board.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_02
 I could find out more about that before the next meeting.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_00
 Is it on a microprocessor based or?

0:07:32	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know but I'll find out more on our next meeting.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_00
 Okay that would be great.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_00
 So if you find out from the technology background okay so that would be good.

0:07:40	SPEAKER_02
 Sounds good.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_01
 Well why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material?

0:07:44	SPEAKER_02
 Because it gets brittle, cracks, we expect these remote controls to be around for several hundred years.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_02
 So good expression.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_02
 Good expression.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_03
 Good expression.

0:08:08	SPEAKER_03
 World after us.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know speak for yourself.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_01
 I think with the window you'd run into the same types of problems.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_01
 So I mean it chips it if you drop it.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure.

0:08:27	SPEAKER_00
 So you're not convinced.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_00
 Actually I'm ready to sell it.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_03
 You're what?

0:08:31	SPEAKER_03
 I'm ready to sell it.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_01
 If you use really good quality wood then it might work but you can't just use.

0:08:37	SPEAKER_01
 No you can sell oils with it.

0:08:38	SPEAKER_03
 The only wood you can use are the ones that are hard to explain.

0:08:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah exactly.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_03
 But there's some very pretty woods out there.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_03
 That's actually a very innovative idea.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_02
 Okay good.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_02
 I'm sorry I'm having a hard time keeping with control over my face.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_03
 But it's actually a very innovative and different idea that you can choose your color of wood, your type of wood.

0:09:02	SPEAKER_03
 Mistain.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_03
 I mean each person is going to have their personalized individualized speech recognition remote control in wood.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_03
 That's not on the market.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah so it looks good.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_00
 The design, the functional design, what about you?

0:09:21	SPEAKER_01
 In terms of comments on this or in terms of my own.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_01
 In terms of wow.

0:09:25	SPEAKER_02
 In terms of comments first.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_02
 She works in the cubicle next to me so she was already a little bit prepared for this.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:33	SPEAKER_02
 Luckily Ed was not.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_01
 I think if we can get the quality materials then it shouldn't influence the design principles too much which you'll see with my presentation.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_01
 One thing we'd have to check those with the users whether, how quickly the novelty wears off of having.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah you would want to have to have splinters in your hand while you're using it.

0:09:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah for example.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_01
 So I have to see how kid friendly it is and all that.

0:10:03	SPEAKER_02
 But actually if your dog gets a hold of it they can use it for teething.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_03
 I did that anyway with rubber and plastic so.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah I do it with other materials as well.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_00
 I'll show them up.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_00
 Okay then let's move to Agni.

0:10:19	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:10:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah that's the one.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah it's a very short presentation because I'm actually going to draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_01
 Which basically shows sort of I took the ideas that we were talking about last time and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that you can actually see on it are the on off switch volume and channel control the menu access button ergonomic shape which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the standard very straight remote controls.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_01
 And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customizing idea is that people can actually do sort of quasi measurements on their hand size if someone has larger hands.

0:11:29	SPEAKER_01
 Right my hand you have a wider remote control.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_02
 And yours for example.

0:11:33	SPEAKER_01
 So that's actually a really good idea for custom customizability.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_01
 One thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it just like you have on flip phones so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it especially if you have little kids around.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_01
 They're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a TV show and accidentally change a channel or turn it off.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_01
 And also you had issues with batteries running at so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery starts to die.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_01
 But in terms of invisible features, audio and tactile feedback on button presses and like you said speech recognition.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_01
 So in terms of what this thing would actually look like, despite working in interface design I'm not the greatest artist in the world so you'll have to forgive me.

0:12:31	SPEAKER_01
 You'd have something like this with an on off switch fairly big sort of in the corner and by itself so you don't accidentally turn your TV off while you're trying to maneuver other buttons.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_01
 And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for channels and volume sort of for surfing channels and then volume.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_01
 So the volume would be the up and down because volume goes up and down and then channels left to right.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 And then here you'd have your sort of standard telephone-ish number pad.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_01
 And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your TV and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control so that if the user doesn't want to use their voice they can just turn it off and you don't have them out control accidentally changing things on you.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_01
 So again you can have a little LCD light somewhere, the flip thing and have I forgotten anything?

0:13:35	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think so.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_01
 So as you can see it's a very very simple design which is one of the things I really wanted to keep.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_01
 It's keep it simple not have too many buttons not have too many functionalities thrown into it.

0:13:47	SPEAKER_01
 I think the design can pretty much carry over to everything although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_02
 It'd be like a copper hinge.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_01
 But you also have to start watching after the wait because depending on how much the flip screen will add to the wait of the remote control you don't want it to start getting too heavy.

0:14:09	SPEAKER_01
 But that's the general layout with the general functionalities if you come up with something else.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_01
 As you can see there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customizably you can make this thing fairly small or fairly large depending on personal preferences.

0:14:27	SPEAKER_01
 So that's pretty much all I had to say.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_01
 I mean everything else in terms of design issues.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_01
 I mean the centering of the keypad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is.

0:14:41	SPEAKER_01
 And you tend to use the volume control and the browsing more than the actual number pad so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you're holding the remote control.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_01
 The number pad a little bit lower because it's useless frequently.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_01
 So once we decide exactly what we want then we can figure out the exact positioning.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_01
 But more or less I think it should go along those lines.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_00
 So what's your comments or simple design?

0:15:12	SPEAKER_03
 So what consumers want?

0:15:13	SPEAKER_03
 It's almost like Houston we have a product here.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_03
 Problem is obviously going to be cost.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_03
 I also have a very simple presentation.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_03
 From the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_03
 I also have a copy to a different type of remote.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_03
 This should only be one in here.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_03
 But try and watch.

0:15:49	None
 Sure.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't be a modified.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_03
 They're stealing our product.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_03
 We've been giving simple questionnaires and different areas because obviously we have to see what the consumers are looking for today because trends change very very quickly.

0:16:11	SPEAKER_03
 In six months maybe this idea has already gone out the window.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_03
 So it's going to be a question of how fast we can act.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_03
 They already erased the rest of mine.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_02
 Go to finance.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no.

0:16:23	SPEAKER_03
 Because I had another comment there.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_03
 The market trend, this is what we know from the last questionnaires and all the surveys we've done.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_03
 Fancy and feel good.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_03
 That's what we've been looking for.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_03
 Something that feels good in the hand that's easy to use.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_03
 Looking for a next generation of innovation because all the remotes out there now, they're all very similar.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_03
 They all do the same thing.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_03
 We have to have something completely different.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_03
 Easy to use has always become another major interest.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_03
 With the whiteboard we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_03
 And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers are actually willing to pay the price for exciting technology.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_03
 So even if we have a product that may be more expensive, if it comes out right, if they didn't look and it looks and feels good and has technology.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_03
 The second two, you can see the last one is a very easy, simple design.

0:17:20	SPEAKER_03
 The second one, there's about 45,000 different buttons on it, which makes it fairly hard to read, very hard to use.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_03
 The first one I see that they put in a display.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_03
 Now, this is something else with the little flip up now.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_03
 We're adding all kinds of things in, but with the little flip up, if you have a little display on the flip up and when you close it, everything is locked.

0:17:40	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe the display also makes it easier to use because sometimes when you're looking for buttons, maybe if you see a display.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_02
 Context sensitive instructions.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_02
 Depending on what the mode, the TV or the DVD or something else.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_01
 It was mostly the standard one.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_03
 Now you have one with a very simple also, the idea is simple, but with a display.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_03
 So you can see what you're doing.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use, trendy, fancy, feels good.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_03
 With a display, wood, designer wood, designer colors.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe what you could do is if somebody orders the device, you could send them like some sort of foam rubber ball and then they would squeeze it and it would take the shape of their hands.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_02
 So it's really molded to your specific.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_02
 The geometry of their hands would be.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_03
 Hard they squeeze.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_03
 You know what kind of wood is there?

0:18:56	SPEAKER_01
 But for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_01
 Unless everyone has their own personal remote.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_02
 That actually would increase the revenue.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_03
 But incorporating the three obviously would be something totally new on the market.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_03
 Totally different.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_01
 Already the customizability is a really good sort of medium.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_03
 What it was, it was a Nokia that came out with the changeable colors.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_03
 Take apart and put it on another face, take it off and put it on another face.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_01
 And that took off.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_03
 They sold millions.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_03
 Millions.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_03
 So, so the findings were the research, easy to use, something totally new.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_03
 We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_02
 We'd also have to consider that who we were going to get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_02
 We might want to learn about labor laws in different countries and stuff.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_02
 So we can do it cheap, but you don't want to exploit labor in third world countries.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_02
 So actually you could turn it around and say that the reason the cost is high for the device is because you're paying a working wage to the person who made the device.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_00
 But we can get a production in countries like India.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_00
 Cost of living is low.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, if it is like India or China or Malaysia.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_00
 So you can go with better futures and better price and you can sell more.

0:20:38	None
 Good.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that would be something that manufacturing would have to explore more.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_03
 Where would you manufacture this is?

0:20:50	SPEAKER_03
 So another step.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_00
 We're here to design.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_00
 But that's a nice product.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_00
 We can talk about the production later, okay, depends on the quantity.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_00
 So we don't need to have our own fabric factory or something.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_00
 So we can have a tie up with who do the fabric with the different electronic items.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_00
 Then we can have a business tie up and to get to get the cost to sell more.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_00
 So let's decide first about the components concept and interface concept.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_00
 If it is acceptable for both of you, what Ed was talking.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_00
 And you will design with the display or without display or just simple.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_01
 I think it depends.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I think it's a good idea.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_01
 But we need to really think about how useful it's going to be because theoretically with a TV you already have a big display right in front of you.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_01
 So if we're trying to keep costs down, then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_01
 Very specifically what it would be used for.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_01
 Because if it's only used for one little thing, then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever may not be the most cost efficient way to go.

0:22:20	SPEAKER_01
 But that's just sort of speculation.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, what do you think Ed?

0:22:27	SPEAKER_02
 You like the display in one of the concepts that you showed.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_02
 Do you know how much it costs to add a little display like this?

0:22:37	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_02
 You want to take an action item to go find out?

0:22:41	SPEAKER_03
 It's because we have to find out a cost on it.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry about that.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_03
 No, that's no problem.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_03
 I'm here for the pushing it after it's made.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_03
 I will market it.

0:22:54	SPEAKER_03
 Once we get a price on it, then we can market it.

0:22:59	SPEAKER_02
 So the advanced chip on print is what we've determined in the engineering industrial design is the recommendation.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_02
 And I think we've kind of come to some agreement regarding this concept of a wooden case.

0:23:19	SPEAKER_02
 A customizable and...

0:23:22	SPEAKER_03
 Nice, beautiful mahogany red wooden case.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_01
 Would the buttons be wood too?

0:23:28	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think so.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_02
 No, I think they could be rubber like they are now.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_02
 So you have that tactile experience.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so what we'll do is we will stick with the simple design for time being until the ad find out about how much it's cost to the extra in case we go for the display.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe what you can do is both of you can come up with the prototype, the model.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_02
 So are we done with this meeting?

0:24:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I hope.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_00
