0:09:32	SPEAKER_02
 Luckily, Ed, we were not.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_01
 What?

0:09:37	SPEAKER_01
 I think we can get the quality materials and it shouldn't influence the design principles too much, which you'll see with my presentation.

0:09:47	SPEAKER_01
 One thing we'd have to check those with the users, whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having.

0:09:53	SPEAKER_02
 Even if we had to be able to get ahead of time.

0:09:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, for example.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_01
 So you'd have to see how kids friendly it is

0:10:04	SPEAKER_02
 and what else would you have for food? I think they could use.

0:10:10	SPEAKER_03
 I would have done that anyway forola pepper and plastic.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:10:14	SPEAKER_02
 I would do that.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_00

0:11:29	SPEAKER_02
 En ook of regel bubbles

0:11:32	SPEAKER_01
 Dat is echt een goed idea voor de customisability. One thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it, just like you have on flip phones, so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it, especially if you have little kids around.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_01
 They're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a TV show and accidentally change a channel or turn it off.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_01
 And also you had issues with batteries running at.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_01
 I thought maybe we could put a little battery life light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery starts to die.

0:12:07	SPEAKER_01
 And in terms of invisible features, audio and tactile feedback on button presses.

0:12:13	SPEAKER_01
 And like you said, speech recognition.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_01
 So in terms of what this thing would actually look like, despite working an interface design, it's the greatest artist in the world, so you'll have to forgive me.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_01
 You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big, sort of in the corner and by itself.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_01
 So you don't accidentally turn your TV off while you're trying to maneuver other buttons.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_01
 And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for channels and volume, sort of surfing channels and then volume.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_01
 So the volume would be the up and down, because volume goes up and down.

0:12:55	SPEAKER_01
 And then channels left to right.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_01
 And then here you'd have your sort of standard telephone-ish number pad.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_01
 And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your TV and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 So that if the user doesn't want to use their voice, they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_01
 So again you can have a little LCD light somewhere, the flip thing.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_01
 And have I forgotten anything?

0:13:35	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think so.

0:13:36	SPEAKER_01
 So as you can see, it's a very, very simple design, which is one of the things I really wanted to keep.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_01
 Just keep it simple, not have too many buttons, not have too many functionalities thrown into it.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 I think the design can pretty much carry over to everything, although with the wood, the flip screen might have to do something slightly different.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe like a copper hinge.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_01
 But you also have to start watching after the wait, because depending on how much the flip screen will add to the wait, of the remote control you don't want it to start getting too heavy.

0:14:08	SPEAKER_01
 But that's the general layout with the general functionalities.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_01
 If we come up with something else, as you can see, there's still lots of space on the actual remote control.

0:14:17	SPEAKER_01
 And if you do it customizably, you could make this thing fairly small or fairly large, depending on personal preferences.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 So that's pretty much all I had to say.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, everything else in terms of design issues.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, the centering of the keypad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_01
 And you tend to use the volume control and the browsing more than the actual number pad.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_01
 So that would be sort of a direct line of where your thumb goes when you're holding the remote control.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_01
 The number pad a little bit lower, because it's used less frequently.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_01
 So once we decide exactly what we want, then we can figure out the exact positioning.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_01
 But more or less, I think it should go along those lines.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_00
 So what's your comment or...

0:15:09	SPEAKER_03
 Simple design.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_03
 So what consumers want.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_03
 It's almost like Houston, we have a product here.

0:15:18	SPEAKER_03
 The problem is obviously going to be cost.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_03
 I also have a very simple presentation.

0:15:28	SPEAKER_03
 From the marketing point, you have to see what the consumers want.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_03
 I also have a copy to a different type of remote.

0:15:40	SPEAKER_03
 If you can find me, wherever I'm at.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_03
 This should only be one in here.

0:15:46	SPEAKER_03
 But try and watch.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 Sure.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_03
 This would be a modified.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_03
 They're stealing our product.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_03
 We've been giving simple questionnaires in different ergens.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_03
 Obviously we have to see what the consumers are looking for today.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_03
 Because the trends change very, very quickly.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_03
 In six months, maybe this idea has already gone out the window.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_03
 So it's going to be a question of how fast we can act.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_03
 They already erased the rest of mine.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 No, go to find this.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_03
 Because I had another comment there.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_03
 The market trend.

0:16:30	SPEAKER_03
 This is what we know from the questionnaires.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_03
 From all the surveys we've done.

0:16:35	SPEAKER_03
 Fancy and feel good.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_03
 That's what we've been looking for.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_03
 Something that feels good in the hand.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_03
 That's easy to use.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_03
 Looking for a next generation of innovation.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_03
 Because all the remotes out there now.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_03
 They're all very similar.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_03
 They all do the same thing.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_03
 We have to have something completely different.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_03
 Easy to use, as always, become another major interest.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_03
 With the whiteboard, we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_03
 And I think this is another thing.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_03
 It's interesting as the consumers actually will need to pay the price for exciting technology.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_03
 So even if we have a product that may be more expensive.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_03
 If it comes out right.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_03
 If they look and it looks and feels good and has technology.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_03
 The second two, you can see the last one is a very easy, simple design.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_03
 The second one, there's about 45,000 different buttons on it.

0:17:23	SPEAKER_03
 Which makes it fairly hard to read, very hard to use.

0:17:26	SPEAKER_03
 The first one, I see that they put in a display.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_03
 Now this is something else with a little flip up.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_03
 Now we're adding all kinds of things in.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_03
 But with a little flip up, if you have a little display on the flip up.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_03
 And when you close it, everything is locked.

0:17:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe the display also makes it easier to use.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_03
 Because sometimes when you're looking for buttons, maybe if you see a display.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_02
 Context, sensitive instructions.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_02
 Depending on what the TV or the DVD or something else.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_01
 Especially the standard one.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_03
 Now you have one with a very simple also.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_03
 The idea is simple, but with a display.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_03
 So you can see what you're doing.

0:18:03	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_03
 Trendy, fancy.

0:18:09	SPEAKER_03
 Feels good.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_03
 With a display.

0:18:16	SPEAKER_03
 wood, designer wood, designer colors.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe what you could do is somebody orders the device.

0:18:23	SPEAKER_02
 You could send them like a, some sort of a foam rubber ball.

0:18:35	SPEAKER_02
 And then they would squeeze it and it would take the shape of their hands.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_02
 So it's really molded to tears.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_02
 And then you would know what the geometry of their hands would be.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_03
 Hardly squeezed.

0:18:50	SPEAKER_03
 Resistance.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_03
 Resistance, right.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_01
 But for that, you'd also have to do an average across families.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_01
 That's right.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_01
 Unless everyone has their own personal remote.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that actually would increase the revenue.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_02
 The sales.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_03
 I hope so.

0:19:12	SPEAKER_03
 No, but incorporating the three obviously would be something totally new on the market.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_03
 Totally different.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_03
 And.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_01
 Already the customized ability is a really good sort of.

0:19:22	SPEAKER_03
 Well, it was a Nokia that came out with the changeable colors.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_03
 Take apart and put on another face.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_03
 Take it off and put on another face.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_01
 And that took off.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_01
 They sold millions.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_03
 Millions.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_03
 So with the findings with the research, easy to use something totally new.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_03
 We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_02
 We'd also have to consider that who we were going to get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes to might learn about labor laws.

0:19:59	SPEAKER_02
 You know, in different countries and stuff.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_02
 So we can do it cheap, but you don't want to exploit labor in third world countries.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_02
 So actually you could turn it, you turn it around and say that your part.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_00
 The reason that cost is high for the device is because you're paying a working wage to the person who made the device.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, yes.

0:20:29	SPEAKER_00
 I've been just like India or China or Malaysia.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_00
 So you can go a bit of futures and better price and you can sell more.

0:20:38	None
 Good.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_02
 Well, that'd be something that manufacturing would have to explore more.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_03
 Where would you manufacture this?

0:20:49	SPEAKER_03
 So another step.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_00
 We're here to design.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_00
 That we can talk about the production later, it depends on the quantity.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_00
 So we don't need to have our own fabric factory or something.

0:21:03	SPEAKER_00
 So we can have a tie up with who do the fabric for the different electronic side times.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_00
 Then we can have a business tie up and to get the cost to sell more.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_00
 So let's decide first about the components concept and interface concept.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_00
 If it is acceptable for both of you, what it was talking.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_00
 And you were designed with the display or with the display or just a simple.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_01
 I think it depends.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's a good idea, but we need to really think about how useful it's going to be because theoretically with a TV you already have a big display right in front of you.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_01
 So if we're trying to keep costs down, then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_01
 It depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for.

0:22:03	SPEAKER_01
 Very specifically what it would be used for.

0:22:05	SPEAKER_01
 Because if it's only used for one little thing, then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever.

0:22:18	SPEAKER_01
 It may not be the most cost efficient way to go, but that's just sort of speculation.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_02
 What do you think Ed?

0:22:26	SPEAKER_02
 You like the display in one of the concepts that you showed.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_02
 Do you know how much it costs to add a little display like this?

0:22:37	SPEAKER_03
 No, no.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_02
 You want to take an action item and go find out?

0:22:41	SPEAKER_03
 Because we have to find out a cost on it.

0:22:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry about that.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_03
 No, that's no problem.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_03
 I'm here for the pushing it after it's made.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_03
 I will market it.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_03
 Once we get a price on it, then we can market it.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_02
 So the advanced chip on print is what we've determined and the engineering industrial design is the recommendation.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_02
 I think we've come to some agreement regarding this concept of a wooden case.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_02
 A customizable and...
