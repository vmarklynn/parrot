0:00:00	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, it fell off.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we're ready.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, welcome to this second meeting.

0:00:23	SPEAKER_03
 It's now quarter after 12 and we're given 40 minutes for this meeting.

0:00:29	SPEAKER_03
 This is a meeting on functional design.

0:00:34	SPEAKER_03
 And I want to welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between.

0:00:40	SPEAKER_03
 I did took minutes from the first meeting and I'll show them to you in a moment.

0:00:46	SPEAKER_03
 I know each of you have a presentation and in thinking about the 40 minutes, I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_03
 Each of you having about seven minutes, maybe a little less for your presentations and a little discussion.

0:01:06	SPEAKER_03
 Because I had to have been told there was a new project requirements and we have to make some decision on what functions it will have.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_03
 Does everybody agree with this?

0:01:21	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_03
 And after the meeting, there'll be things to be done.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_03
 And as you can see, it says we get to get lunch and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_03
 But now for the minutes of the first meeting.

0:01:49	SPEAKER_03
 So we'll talk about that one.

0:01:52	SPEAKER_03
 As you can see, it was this earlier today.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_03
 Kate, Steph, Sarah and myself in our four capacities were present.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_03
 I opened the meeting.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_03
 The product was developed and reviewed.

0:02:09	SPEAKER_03
 And we talked about the financial end of it.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_03
 And it's some implications.

0:02:15	SPEAKER_03
 Sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons, bright colors and some of the influence of the Japanese.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_03
 And we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting reports together for this meeting.

0:02:33	SPEAKER_03
 Anybody have any questions on those minutes?

0:02:37	SPEAKER_03
 Are they complete? Did they discuss everything that we covered last time?

0:02:43	SPEAKER_02
 Did I miss something?

0:02:47	SPEAKER_02
 We talked about the individual roles that we each had as well.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_03
 I'm afraid I incorporated that when I said who was present.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_03
 We did and we did a little bit of team building of both making the pictures.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_03
 But I didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_03
 So as a group, I think we are accepting minutes.

0:03:16	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_00
 Is that what we were supposed to say?

0:03:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:03:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I did.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_03
 Good.

0:03:24	SPEAKER_03
 Then we'll move to the three presentations.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_03
 We need to move this.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_03
 Who wants to go first?

0:03:44	SPEAKER_03
 That's as far as it goes.

0:03:49	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if it's actually these.

0:03:52	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, it doesn't have any on this one.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_02
 Excellent.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_02
 Thank you.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_02
 She said we didn't need to screw it in.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, that looks good.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_03
 It's doing its thing.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_00
 There we are.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_00
 Thank you very much.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_00
 One of the biggest issues I thought about from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell more million of these remote controls.

0:04:50	SPEAKER_00
 And I think that this is an opportunity to really take real reaction in the direction of similar hand-held tools that have been used and are used by many of us.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_00
 And to kind of bring the remote control into the same realm as an accessible, useful electronic device as opposed to something that is lost in the couch.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_00
 So my main goal here is to re-envision remote control in this context and to think about the functionality and the current technology and the fact that it could be interacted with other tools.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_00
 Some of the research in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now.

0:05:40	SPEAKER_00
 And that means we do need to make some decisions about what keys or buttons on the remote control to perhaps keep and what one said is card.

0:05:54	SPEAKER_00
 And if we devote some energy into this, I think the recent productions of real reaction, I go everywhere power and the high-definition DVD players.

0:06:08	SPEAKER_00
 Although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_00
 I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools. And in fact, I think the high-definition DVD players and all of this will come along and we will only benefit from the positive feedback from our well-designed tool.

0:06:30	SPEAKER_00
 So again, most users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls. 50% I think of all these numbers, most important is 50% of users say they only use 10% of the buttons.

0:06:46	SPEAKER_00
 And 80% of users, and if we think about this, there are a lot of television, DVDs, stereo, remote control users out there. 80% spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy.

0:07:01	SPEAKER_02
 Could come out with this comfort with this market?

0:07:04	SPEAKER_00
 It was marked at research and there were a hundred people in the room, so 80 out of 100 said they would spend more money.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_03
 In between, as the project manager, they sent me an email from the powers that be that teletext is outdated and the internet is coming in as important.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_03
 But that they want this remote control to only be for TV with incorporating the corporate image color and slogan.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_00
 I think we can really focus on this remote and bring the real reaction branding in and get some positive marketing for our tools, even if we don't advertise for the IGO everywhere.

0:07:59	SPEAKER_00
 So an interesting element was the, would you pay more for speech recognition questions?

0:08:08	SPEAKER_00
 So these market research questionnaires looked into your concern about technology and specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_00
 Now the early adopters, those of us who grew up with technology and lucky for us have the cash to pay for it, the young age group, without the mortgages and responsibilities, 91% of them would pay more for speech recognition in our remote control.

0:08:49	SPEAKER_00
 Very interesting. I leave this up to the group to decide if we want to use this in the designers, but 91%.

0:08:58	SPEAKER_03
 Is it a large enough target market to target it?

0:09:01	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I think, especially in terms of growth, I think this would be a very smart group to target.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, three quarters of the next age group 25 to 35 are interested and with the technologies improving, if we can get things.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_03
 In real numbers, there's the 91% and the 76% translate to in excess of the 4 million or 8 million.

0:09:29	SPEAKER_00
 But would you pay more and doesn't work and is it approachable and did I know that it was?

0:09:37	SPEAKER_00
 That's a very good question.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if speech recognition should be included, but I think it's interesting. I think that maybe shows more about being open to technology.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_01
 Definitely.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_01
 I've got more research on how much more it would be and any existing examples and what reactions to them would be.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_02
 How well our target growth compares to the 50% of existing, that's a pretty good idea.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_02
 But if we're able to build this thing into 12 years, 50% is a natural.

0:10:20	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly. I mean, I did not receive any information on that, but I think the competition, assessing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very, very important.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_00
 Because there was a question about, you want an LCD screen that wasn't responded to, but some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_00
 It turns into something, perhaps you all have seen the Osborne Square, as the Osborne is attempting to manage the super entertainment system with something that looks like a small train.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's a small population.

0:11:09	SPEAKER_02
 You're exactly right.

0:11:11	SPEAKER_00
 But I think the key is to get the early adopters, people with my own technology and they'll be...

0:11:18	SPEAKER_03
 We're not looking at whether the earlier adopters on that screen, that's looking at age groups.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, and I'm making the leap that people who are familiar with technology, that are comfortable.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, you had the other power. I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist, power, channel volume, and everything else is up to the designs.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_00
 And this is also supported by the market research.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, thank you. That's my contribution.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_03
 And we'll turn to the next presentation.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_03
 I think she said we don't need to screw it in, just stick it in and then press FN and F8.

0:12:38	SPEAKER_03
 Next to the control button on the bottom and then F8 at the top.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_03
 And then we'll be patient.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_02
 Tada!

0:12:58	SPEAKER_02
 Can I not just do it to my order?

0:13:03	SPEAKER_02
 You can't be loaded.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_02
 There we are.

0:13:16	SPEAKER_01
 Great, technical functions design.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think first off, basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as your personal preferences.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_01
 I think we need a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_01
 So my method was to look at the existing emotes and what functions they have.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_01
 And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_01
 Pretty much the same as what existing emotes have if we can build on this with the speech recognition.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_01
 That's not something I've brought about at all.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_01
 But it's also something we can discuss.

0:14:04	SPEAKER_01
 And I presume we can miss out functions related to a video or DVD in look control.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_01
 If this is only going to be a TZM-like cable TV in look control.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_01
 So these are two models of existing look controls.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_01
 The one on the left seems to be a fairly standard universal in look control.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_01
 It has fast forward stop play or related to movies.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_01
 It also has, seems to have channel up and channel down, which is more of what we'd expect from either a sky or a cable in look control.

0:14:47	SPEAKER_01
 When you've got hundreds of channels instead of a nearly terrestrial one.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_01
 But I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right, which has also have play, stop and pause.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_01
 I don't think we need them at all.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_01
 I think we just need channel selection volume up volume down.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_01
 And I think an inter function where you can access, it's not like teletext, but along the same line, the access things on the screen.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_01
 Not related to internet one that you mentioned because that would be fire outside our budget and what we want this to do.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_03
 And it's either requirements to expecting others.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's either requirements because the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions, which is more of a text on the screen.

0:15:51	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know how to add your buttons, I was thinking something, something smooth, sleek, little, remote control, big user friendly buttons and a menu that you can access.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_01
 But then I do think we need to discuss the speech and recognition possibility.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_03
 Anything else you want?

0:16:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_01
 So we could go back to the pictures of the pictures of the local draws and possibly discuss what we think about them.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_01
 Or go, maybe just hear what Kate has to say.

0:16:41	SPEAKER_00
 Or be afterwards we could do a whiteboard that you're the one on the right as a basis.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_03
 I think the white, the one on the right as well as less cluttered.

0:17:03	SPEAKER_01
 Definitely less cluttered.

0:17:06	SPEAKER_01
 But still it's, it's there, but it's used something else I was going to say.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_01
 The style of these is terrifying.

0:17:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_01
 I really think we need to not only possibly even materials, like the type of plastic used, but everything including size and shape of buttons, positioning of buttons, the actual shape of the handheld device colors.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_00
 Or the ergonomics.

0:17:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, everything to do with this has to be revolutionized.

0:17:43	SPEAKER_01
 But.

0:17:45	SPEAKER_01
 So that's that for now.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:07	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_02
 Now I want to bring us down to earth again.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_02
 So let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is.

0:19:06	SPEAKER_02
 So I think it's for sending a message to be by infrared.

0:19:17	SPEAKER_02
 And the basic components we've got to build in for our 12,000, 50 energy source, the user interface.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_02
 Incorporate an integrated circuit that actually composes the message based on what we, which buttons, the unit presses, we turn that into a message.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_02
 And then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver.

0:19:45	SPEAKER_02
 Now I would have hoped, I think that's my only slide actually, yeah, I would have hoped to do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of my first cut design.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_02
 But unfortunately, technology defeated me. So if you're bear with me, I'll do it on the whiteboard.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 So we want an energy source.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_02
 And we've got to think about what that might be.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_02
 And we have the user interface.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_02
 And the main components in there are the chip that actually has the intelligence of a machine that translates button presses into a message, which it then transfers to some sending mechanism, which encodes it.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_02
 And sends the message to the receiver.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_02
 So those are the basic things that we've got to get in the cloud.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_03
 But those things, as long as we can get those components, the block that rectangle for the user interface is where the user comes in and what's it look like, what do the buttons look like?

0:22:05	SPEAKER_03
 What does it feel like? That's where the user interface is really coming into its own.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_03
 The technical end is what's actually going to be in there. But also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_03
 For example, the battery energy source or what if the chip for whatever reason breaks down after a certain amount of time, do you just replace it?

0:22:39	SPEAKER_03
 Because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces like for DVDs, movies, whatever does it have to have a way of being segregated from the others in a different frequency or something?

0:23:00	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I'm a wrong here, but I've been thinking of this device as being a cheap mass-produced device, which I myself am really a modern.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_02
 That's almost one in every tent powder or whatever it is.

0:23:15	SPEAKER_02
 I haven't thought of it as being a repair, but I'm not convinced we've been put it into this box for the price that we're going to need to hit.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_00
 I've been thinking of a repair, some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has B-spacic elements, because then...

0:23:48	SPEAKER_00
 I don't believe any of that. I'm not convinced my personal coach is going to give me some advice on my question.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_01
 It does seem like we're just doing something really simple and mass-produced, which is pretty much the same as these existing models, just maybe inspired, a little bit more inspired, but basically just the same.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_01
 Although what suddenly came into my head is they always take two AA batteries, which is really not very efficient at all.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_01
 It could be possible to have a rechargeable internal battery, like an NPC player does, or a mobile phone or whatever. You just plug into a parasol, and then it's charged for ages and ages and ages.

0:24:50	SPEAKER_00
 You don't have to worry if you're placing AA batteries, or that has another element, which is if every time you're done using the remote, you put it on a charger, then it has a battery.

0:25:02	SPEAKER_01
 You'd never need the batteries, but it also has a place. It's not stuck down the back of the sofa. But then again, I don't know if this is within our Christmassy internet.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's a very interesting idea. I'm not a very good industrial designer, and I don't know much about what these things cost. I'll do some research for the next meeting.

0:25:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_00
 Better than the idea about solar.

0:25:24	SPEAKER_02
 So that may not be so good when you're watching TV in the night.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_03
 It would have to store up the energy, and then use it.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_03
 So that we can do that. We are not too heavy and cost too much.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_01
 No, but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably... I mean, it might cost more at first to develop and to install.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_01
 But for a long term use, there'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky AA batteries, and not having any in your kitchen drawer.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_02
 You might make that a selling point if it was something that you could afford to develop.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_00
 Definitely, because I'm thinking in terms of the last and breakage of remote time, it's just to be a little dark, but you can't exactly...

0:26:34	SPEAKER_00
 And the dark could look very fancy.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_03
 That could be your inspiration.

0:26:39	SPEAKER_01
 So I don't know if you could decently...

0:26:40	SPEAKER_01
 So I don't know if you could decently...

0:26:41	SPEAKER_01
...within our face age.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_00
 And we are talking about another component that can be a piece of it.

0:26:46	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. Are we agreed as to what our target group is, though?

0:26:54	SPEAKER_03
 Pretty much so that we'd be looking for the younger end.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_00
 I think you guys see the questions about are there an athlete's peacock?

0:27:01	SPEAKER_00
 Or are they making purchasing decisions?

0:27:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I'm just wondering that because I agree that people with...

0:27:08	SPEAKER_02
 How can I put it more money than a sentence?

0:27:12	SPEAKER_00
 I usually put more money than brains.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_00
 I'll make a note of that.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_02
 But what I was going to say was that although they may be buying personal music devices, and they're not all necessarily buying TV with my components, because they probably live in a household that has a TV of low end of their range.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_00
 It might be good to know who is actually buying time.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_00
 And are we in the region where people have many intentions?

0:27:46	SPEAKER_02
 I think we've got a big hill behind it.

0:27:48	SPEAKER_02
 I haven't really read about this way.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_02
 People who've got a remote control, because they can't even tell you that they should buy our product instead.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_03
 Or do we make sure that it goes through the manufacturer?

0:27:58	SPEAKER_03
 We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_03
 That's probably what would be a more efficient way of doing it.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_00
 And some of our DV players incidentally have them because we have federal agencies that are putting the department that more of them into the go-to-go.

0:28:19	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_01
 Are you going to share any resolutions by the end of the day?

0:28:25	SPEAKER_03
 Probably not.

0:28:28	SPEAKER_03
 The other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_03
 Our functions, we've so far decided, I think, that power channel volume, make it attractive.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_03
 It has to have an entry key and of course the number keys.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_03
 It has to have big user friendly buttons.

0:28:59	SPEAKER_03
 Definitely, we want to be inspired that the current styles are just playing awful.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_00
 Do we need...

0:29:10	SPEAKER_03
 Is that agreeable to everyone?

0:29:12	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, the entry key, I have a chart nearby, I didn't think food.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_00
 But it gives my view.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_03
 Which might throw some light on that.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, those are...

0:29:29	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but a lot of charts.

0:29:35	SPEAKER_03
 Actually, we are almost a half hour out of the 40 minutes that we have to get close to finishing.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_00
 My only comment is, I think maybe we could somehow include an entry key in a power key.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_00
 Ah.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_00
 That was my only...

0:29:54	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:29:58	SPEAKER_03
 Enter power as a simultaneous key.

0:30:02	SPEAKER_00
 Exactly.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_00
 Is that okay with you?

0:30:06	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry, I was reading the chart.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_02
 So, how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually want to press enter?

0:30:15	SPEAKER_00
 Well, if you're pressing enter the thing without a beyond.

0:30:20	SPEAKER_00
 So, maybe when you press power, when you press power again, and you use that as an entry key.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_00
 So, you have to have an off key.

0:30:32	SPEAKER_00
 Well, I was thinking maybe to turn it off, you'd have to press power twice.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_00
 That's interesting.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_00
 And maybe power follows something like a channel down power, and then that would make that choice.

0:30:44	SPEAKER_02
 What could I do with it?

0:30:47	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I'd do this, or we just won't even get credit.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_00
 Or, yeah, or something that has a turning dial where far-ended...

0:30:55	SPEAKER_00
 Who's got an iPod then?

0:30:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I don't.

0:31:00	SPEAKER_00
 I wish.

0:31:01	SPEAKER_00
 Anyway, that was the only comment about some of the decisions people made.

0:31:06	SPEAKER_00
 What's most important?

0:31:08	SPEAKER_00
 Definitely channel-line power.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, things like screen settings and audio settings.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_01
 I would generally do them on the actual television itself.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_01
 Like, yeah, you have a little flap and a little control panel on the actual box itself.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_01
 I wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_01
 So, I would say that they are definitely less relevant.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_00
 Thanks for looking at that.

0:31:44	SPEAKER_03
 So, I guess easy to use is the other thing that we want to be able to do.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_03
 As you said, don't make it too hard for the granny.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_03
 I just joined that set last week.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, I read this.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_03
 First grandchild arrived.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_03
 So, are we agreed then of those things?

0:32:13	SPEAKER_03
 And let's go back to agenda and hook me up.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_03
 I think it's going to be fun.

0:32:28	None
 You probably won't go the first time.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_03
 I'll probably be able to mess.

0:32:37	SPEAKER_03
 Come on.

0:32:38	SPEAKER_03
 It lost it off here.

0:32:44	SPEAKER_03
 No, it was up there, but I couldn't see it down here.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_03
 This time it should be both.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_03
 There we go.

0:33:10	SPEAKER_02
 How do you do that?

0:33:16	SPEAKER_03
 You have to keep doing the FN and F8 to five minutes to finish.

0:33:23	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you a lot for telling me.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:33:30	SPEAKER_03
 We're ready to close.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_03
 That will be completed a questionnaire.

0:33:37	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to have some time for individual work to continue our research.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_03
 And I'll put some minutes of this meeting together.

0:33:48	SPEAKER_03
 Your individual assignments are for Kate to do the components for you staff to do the user interface.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_03
 We'll use the trend watching and each of us will get help from our coach.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_03
 We agreed to get ourselves together and then have lunch.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_03
 That's the end of this meeting.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_01
 I hope that's good enough for her to tell her that's the end.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_03
 I think I went over the functions and wrote them down and marked them.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_03
 That's what I went over and nobody was objecting to me.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_00
 You mentioned I was just going to say could you really go and meet my requirements?

0:34:43	SPEAKER_00
 It has to be for a TV just to be next time.

0:34:48	SPEAKER_03
 The teletext is outdated.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_03
 The internet is important.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_03
 It's only to be for a TV and it must include the corporate image, color and slogan, which I think is more in the user range with staff.

0:35:07	SPEAKER_01
 Is that the yellow and black?

0:35:10	SPEAKER_03
 It doesn't tell me.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_01
 I'll just use it in the website.

0:35:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.
