0:00:00	SPEAKER_02
 Can you just remind me, I don't have to tick the note and okay thing until I finish writing, but it's only if I go back to it, I tick okay again.

0:00:29	SPEAKER_01
 If you're back to a page, then you tick it again to leave it for the second time.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_02
 So if I'm working, if I've done a page, I'm on the second page, I tick it to say I finish that page, and I go back to this, I can just write and then not tick until I finish writing again.

0:00:52	SPEAKER_02
 So it's always after, you never have to do it before, fine.

0:01:04	SPEAKER_01
 I don't believe all this stuff, it's just amazing.

0:01:09	SPEAKER_02
 And you can go on both sides as well.

0:01:13	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, yeah right.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_00
 Where should we start?

0:01:18	SPEAKER_00
 Well I think the first thing is...

0:01:19	SPEAKER_02
 What have we got?

0:01:21	SPEAKER_02
 Well the first thing I think is we need to sort out the core for abstracts or the core for titles, because something that's kind of overdue.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:01:33	SPEAKER_02
 So I volunteered to do that if you like.

0:01:40	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:01:41	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so...

0:01:46	SPEAKER_02
 And I'll do that by...

0:01:51	SPEAKER_02
 I think it was it Thursday today, I'll do that by the end of the week anyway.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_01
 And was it your idea to stick a bit in it where you say we're inviting like from quite a wide audience when we gave priority to linguists?

0:02:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, we're going to do that, but I think we should probably send out...

0:02:15	SPEAKER_02
 Separate calls.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so we'll send one that won't...

0:02:19	SPEAKER_02
 I mean we could mention the fact that we're inviting other people, but I think it would probably just...

0:02:24	SPEAKER_02
 I mean it probably won't matter too much to the other linguists that we're having other people there.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_02
 We can mention it, but it's not going to be too essential.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_02
 And we might actually just end up making them worry that they're going to lose their place or whatever.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_00
 Separate calls is a good idea.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_02
 We do have to decide the priority thing, so that's something else we can look at a little bit later down the line.

0:02:53	SPEAKER_02
 So that's the one for Ling basically, and I'll send that out.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_02
 I'll do that today or tomorrow.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_02
 Now Claire, that's the other thing. She can deal with the psychology.

0:03:19	SPEAKER_02
 Psychology people probably, I reckon that's the best thing to do, because she'll know which email address to use and everything else.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_02
 So if one of us could email Claire, yeah.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_01
 Is it without volunteering?

0:03:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_01
 Or, yeah, right.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_02
 So if Robert emails Claire, and we're going to need to decide exactly what she's going to say on there, we might need to just remind her of the dates, in case she doesn't know.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_02
 She gets the dates, right?

0:04:00	SPEAKER_02
 And I know she already knows that it's just anyone doing psycholinguistics basically.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_02
 So that's fine.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_01
 And actually kind of take care of itself as well.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_01
 If she just sends one around to everyone, then only the psycholinguists will say it was for me.

0:04:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, exactly.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_02
 But then there's the rest of PPLS, and I think we need to decide whether

0:04:29	SPEAKER_00
 the text for the actual call, is she going to rework something or?

0:04:37	SPEAKER_02
 I think she should just write her own.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_00
 Probably. I think she might be glad to see kind of their one for the linguistics.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so what we'll do is I'll copy it.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, the thing is that the main call will go out before she's got around to it anyway.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_01
 Because I can't imagine there'd be an essential difference between it.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_02
 No, there won't be.

0:05:05	SPEAKER_02
 The only thing I'm thinking is I want to make sure that it stands out as something applicable to them, that they don't go, oh, we're just getting rubbish from, you know what I mean?

0:05:17	SPEAKER_02
 I want them to really know that it's addressed to them.

0:05:21	SPEAKER_02
 And the good thing about Claire sending it is she's probably got a psych email address as well, and it might look a bit more relevant to them.

0:05:29	SPEAKER_02
 They know her.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, exactly.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_02
 They know her, et cetera.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_02
 So, yeah, so if I've CC'd the original one, then you can tell her that that can be the basis for her email, but just make sure that they know it's relevant to them, et cetera.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_02
 And obviously in PPLS, we've also got English language now.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_02
 In a way, we could send out that first call to them just as part of the same email, because I think they're more likely to think it was relevant to them.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_02
 I don't really know.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_02
 I don't really know what you think about that.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_02
 I think we definitely should open it up to English language.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_02
 I think particularly at the moment, because they're really trying to sort of merge us into one subject area, even though it should be meaningless, because we're all part of the school.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_02
 I think that it does actually make a difference.

0:06:32	SPEAKER_02
 So, I think we should invite them, but then we've still got the problem of a priority issue.

0:06:39	SPEAKER_02
 Probably what I was thinking is certainly second and third years absolutely need to be top priority.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_02
 But then there's a kind of awkward question of where we put first years, because they don't need to if they want to, should they have priority.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_02
 This is a kind of lower point, but it kind of crosses over with deciding what we're going to do.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_01
 Well, do we have an idea of how many people are going to actually have their whole thing, any kind of, because then it seems to me quite obvious, and we just track the number of second and third year students, and everything else is just, I would favour doing it just on a first-come, first-serve basis.

0:07:30	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. Well, let's send out the console as possible, see what reactions we get, and then...

0:07:39	SPEAKER_01
 But I mean, like, say...

0:07:41	SPEAKER_01
 We were going to do this thing for, I can't even remember, was it two or three days?

0:07:46	SPEAKER_02
 It's three days.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, and so how many posters and talks are you going to actually get here?

0:07:53	SPEAKER_02
 They were 20 minute talks with 10 minute question time, okay, and you can run two in a row, but probably not three, but up to three.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_02
 Two in a row or three in a row?

0:08:09	SPEAKER_01
 You could do two in a row, and that's now, isn't it?

0:08:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_01
 And then give it a 20 minute break, perhaps.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I mean, the thing is, every time we have a break, there's a question of whether we actually serve coffee and biscuits and things, because that's a kind of normal thing to do.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_00
 If we go for, say...

0:08:33	SPEAKER_00
 I'm taking a slot of one and a half hour each, so three, actually, each, that will be three per day, times three, will be 27.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_02
 So are you saying have, say, three sessions in a row, and then do that twice in the morning and twice in the afternoon?

0:08:51	SPEAKER_00
 So it'd be six in the morning, twice in the afternoon.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, so just have an hour and a half in the morning?

0:08:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I mean, or twice in the morning, once in the afternoon.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, would six hours a day be pushing it?

0:09:03	SPEAKER_02
 Not necessarily, because, I mean, the good thing is, would we get that many people wanting to give talks?

0:09:10	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I suppose what we can do is think about the structure now and say, right, what's the maximum we can do?

0:09:17	SPEAKER_02
 So I think that's about as much as we could do, to have an hour and a half, then have a coffee break, then have an hour and a half, then have lunch, hour and a half coffee break, hour and a half.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_02
 And so that would be 18 hours of talks overall, wouldn't it?

0:09:31	SPEAKER_02
 But what do we say?

0:09:33	SPEAKER_02
 So it's 12, 36 talks.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_02
 Is that right?

0:09:37	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm, maximum 36.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, let's just put this down.

0:09:45	SPEAKER_01
 How many seconds a third year students are there?

0:10:02	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I could look, I've got that.

0:10:07	SPEAKER_02
 There's the list, isn't there, postgraduate that I maintain in linguistics?

0:10:19	SPEAKER_02
 There are probably about 30 on there.

0:10:23	SPEAKER_01
 Right, okay.

0:10:25	SPEAKER_02
 But a good number of them are first years, and I don't know.

0:10:30	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, just to get an idea, are you planning on talking?

0:10:32	SPEAKER_02
 No, are you planning? And I'm probably not. So there's a good chance that almost none of the first years are going to volunteer.

0:10:40	SPEAKER_02
 So if we had, say, 20 linguistics, and even then, I mean, there were quite a few people who were abroad and who won't bother to turn up or can't make it or whatever.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_02
 So, you know, it might be that we only get, say, 15 anyway, and then we could be left with 15 blocks for the rest of PPLS.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_02
 So, at least we know that we've got an absolute limit of about 36 talks.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_01
 We're also going to be having posters, aren't we? And I should imagine that most people would rather do a poster than give a photo.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_02
 That's what the coffee breaks will be for, and maybe lunch times. But coffee breaks are probably more like, are we going to be a better time because people will hang around, whereas people are more likely to go off somewhere for lunch, aren't they?

0:11:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_01
 But wouldn't we want to actually just, like, dedicate an afternoon or a moment to be in a poster session?

0:12:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. That's what I was about to say. Poster session is a good idea because just the people presenting the posters are there and can say something about it.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, there's always a problem again than the people who are presenting the posters still get around to go and look at others.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_01
 But people kind of, like, generally sort of sort them out themselves.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, it's the thing about posters, unless you kind of say, you know, if your name is in the first half of a bet, you can move and the other ones can't.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_02
 So, how long should a poster session be? Like, how long will people want to mill around for looking at?

0:12:42	SPEAKER_01
 I'd make it a whole morning or a whole afternoon.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, just because, like, ones that I've been to as well, people tend to kind of come and go from them.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_01
 And I mean, I'd say a whole, either a whole morning or a whole afternoon, at least, but that's just, I mean, just based on the ones that I've been to.

0:13:07	SPEAKER_02
 So that means we could have 30 talks plus one a.m. or p.m. posters.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_02
 And we could probably get quite a few in there. At least six, anyway.

0:13:25	SPEAKER_02
 At least six.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_02
 At least six posters.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, right.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_02
 Like, how many can you have going on at once?

0:13:35	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's just kind of dictated by the size of the room.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, would we have poster boards or is it just going to be posters on the walls?

0:13:45	SPEAKER_01
 Like, do we have any information? I should have found this out. Are you guys second years of first year?

0:13:50	SPEAKER_01
 First year of first year.

0:13:51	SPEAKER_01
 So none of us have been to this before?

0:13:53	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_02
 I've been to Durham Postgraduate Conference.

0:13:59	SPEAKER_02
 And I mean, every conference I've ever been to, the posters have always been in the coffee break, which is why.

0:14:05	SPEAKER_02
 Probably because normally they're limited on space.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_00
 Actually, we have a message here from Mids about the poster session.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_00
 The poster session was introduced in 1999 as part of the main conference.

0:14:15	SPEAKER_00
 In 2000, it was held separately in October.

0:14:18	SPEAKER_00
 The intention was to use it as a way to introduce incoming post grad students to the department's research culture.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_00
 However, I did not pursue this idea the following year because the comments I received from students in 2000 were generally discouraging.

0:14:31	SPEAKER_00
 On the other hand, I later learned that some students did find the October poster session quite a useful experience.

0:14:37	SPEAKER_00
 My suggestion, therefore, is to reexamine the idea of poster session altogether and find a better way to implement it if there seems to be enough interest in it.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I think keeping it alongside the conference is possibly one main thing.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_00
 Last sentence.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_00
 One possibility is to put it back in the main conference and let people choose between a paper presentation and a poster.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:01	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's definitely the idea.

0:15:03	SPEAKER_02
 I think the best idea.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_02
 I can imagine it would seem a bit random, just have like a poster session and just have a poster session.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_02
 What would it be at the beginning?

0:15:15	SPEAKER_02
 So I suppose is it normally second years do it like just after they've come back for this?

0:15:21	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:15:22	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, you mean an October thing?

0:15:25	SPEAKER_01
 That's what it would be.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_01
 I think.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_01
 Well, it seems to me that he was saying that everyone would do it because its goal was to give the new intake.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but I don't think he means that it would be the first years who have only just arrived would do a poster.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no, no.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so at least anyone who's feeling...

0:15:46	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know what I might do.

0:15:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, exactly.

0:15:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I might do.

0:15:50	SPEAKER_02
 I'm still a little bit doubtful, but...

0:15:53	SPEAKER_02
 So that's good anyway.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:15:59	SPEAKER_02
 We've got an idea.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_02
 I think there's 30 talks and say six, ten posters, whatever.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_02
 We can manage to fit in the room.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_02
 So we need to look at where we're going to hold it.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_02
 We could have it in B9, but there's things all over the wall.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_02
 There are those pictures that run all the way around.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, these are links.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_02
 So can we take the pictures down?

0:16:22	SPEAKER_02
 Can we use B9 for the posters?

0:16:24	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we should find out if January they use poster boards.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_01
 If there are some poster boards that we can get hold of, then that's...

0:16:32	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so post the boards.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I'll do all email mitts about that.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:16:39	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:16:40	SPEAKER_00
 Right into the call that we are considering the idea of having a poster session.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_00
 Mm-hmm.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_00
 So people can indicate would they prefer to give a poster or a talk?

0:16:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_00
 But the ultimate decision is on our set because we have to see.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_00
 How does it work out with the poster session?

0:17:01	SPEAKER_00
 How does it work out with the talk?

0:17:03	SPEAKER_02
 Well, what we'll do is say, we can just say, if you want to do a talk, then just say so.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_02
 And if you want to do a poster, then say you want to do a poster and we can sort of base it around that.

0:17:14	SPEAKER_02
 And if we get absolutely tons of people wanting to do posters and we don't think everyone's kind of done it as a compout, then we might have to sort of say to them, well, would you consider doing a talk instead because, particularly the second and third years, because we need more talks and just do it like that.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yep.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_02
 Um...

0:17:37	SPEAKER_02
 We could even say something like, um...

0:17:41	SPEAKER_02
 You know, first years might want to give a poster or something like that because I don't know, maybe that's a bad idea.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_03
 Just...

0:17:50	SPEAKER_00
 Throw a general suggestion at them so you know what happens.

0:17:53	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so we got some sort of idea of...

0:18:08	SPEAKER_02
 The structure and how many talks are we going to be able to have?

0:18:14	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the maximum. I mean, I guess that will evolve when we get a response from people.

0:18:20	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:18:21	SPEAKER_01
 That's fine, isn't it?

0:18:22	SPEAKER_02
 So, I've...

0:18:24	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so English language, um, we'll put on the main call and I'll just...

0:18:29	SPEAKER_02
 I'll just kind of market it as a linguistics English language or something like that, I think.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_01
 And is the other main group then, um, philosophy?

0:18:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, and informatics.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_02
 We've got a lot of things to think about as well.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_02
 So, I had a look at whether they do philosophy of language and logic and stuff here, and they kind of do.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_02
 There's about...

0:18:56	SPEAKER_02
 I think they do.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_02
 There's about three or four full-time members of staff that list philosophy of language.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_02
 Philosophy of language is a major interest, so chances are they're going to have some PhD students that are interested.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_02
 So, do we think we should invite them?

0:19:15	SPEAKER_02
 I think... I'd be surprised if we got sort of four out of them.

0:19:20	SPEAKER_02
 I think that would be still amazing if we did.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_02
 So, I think it's probably worth it.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think we're going to get inundated with requests.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_02
 So, I think it's worth asking them.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_01
 Asking philosophy.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_01
 And to think informatics would...

0:19:36	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, I think informatics are definitely worth asking.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_02
 Uh, there's...

0:19:42	SPEAKER_02
 There's CSDR and...

0:19:45	SPEAKER_02
 um...

0:19:47	SPEAKER_02
 HCLC.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I'm thinking that the informatics potentially is quite a big response.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_01
 It is.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it might be interesting stuff coming in.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_00
 But something recently about...

0:20:02	SPEAKER_00
 I think somebody's master's project to look in how far English is actually...

0:20:09	SPEAKER_00
 or in how far English is a shaping influence on programming languages.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_01
 All right, cool.

0:20:15	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_01
 Um...

0:20:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it is...

0:20:24	SPEAKER_01
 Would we want to ask them and put some kind of like proviso in to make it, um, specific to sort of preemptively...

0:20:34	SPEAKER_01
 um, weed out the numbers or should we just say to them?

0:20:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well, it would be nice to do that language.

0:20:39	SPEAKER_02
 If you got something to think about language...

0:20:41	SPEAKER_02
 It would be nice to do it.

0:20:42	SPEAKER_02
 The thing is we can't afford to bias it towards any particular kind of linguistics in a sense because it's such a...

0:20:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:49	SPEAKER_02
 Because of the way our department is, then we're supposed to sort of embrace all kinds of...

0:20:53	SPEAKER_02
 In fact, even by inviting people from...

0:20:58	SPEAKER_02
...informatics and from...

0:21:02	SPEAKER_02
 Or maybe from philosophy and things.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_02
 It might...

0:21:05	SPEAKER_02
...bias it in a particular direction.

0:21:07	SPEAKER_02
 But I don't know.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_02
 It's probably not too bad.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_02
 I think that...

0:21:11	SPEAKER_02
 I think that between philosophy and informatics and psychology, you've probably got quite a lot of bread there anyway.

0:21:17	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_02
 The thing is...

0:21:20	SPEAKER_02
 The one thing is...

0:21:23	SPEAKER_02
 The only kind of people doing anything like...

0:21:25	SPEAKER_02
 Applied linguistics...

0:21:27	SPEAKER_02
 Are they applied linguists themselves and people in sociology with an interest in language?

0:21:31	SPEAKER_02
 And I don't think we'll be inviting them.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_02
 But I don't think that's too bad because...

0:21:36	SPEAKER_02
 The first thing is there's a good reason for inviting everyone in PPLS because we are in one school.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_02
 And then the fact that we also invite people from informatics, I suppose it's just that...

0:21:47	SPEAKER_02
...we do have pretty strong ties with them.

0:21:51	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think anyone would be too offended.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_02
 I hope not anyway.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_02
 So yeah, so what kind of proviso can we put on?

0:22:02	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, we could...

0:22:04	SPEAKER_02
 We could just say outright anyone in there...

0:22:07	SPEAKER_02
...third year or anyone in their second or third year.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_02
 But I don't know.

0:22:12	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_02
 Or we can just, you know, take whatever we get and pick the best between us, which is...

0:22:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:23	SPEAKER_01
 It seems the most straightforward.

0:22:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, just say it's only just in the general thing saying the linguistics department is having this conference and we're doing quite...

0:22:29	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:22:30	SPEAKER_02
...a nice graduate from the mathematics.

0:22:32	SPEAKER_02
 You're going to email Claire.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_02
 So who wants to send something out to informatics?

0:22:39	SPEAKER_01
 I'll do that.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_01
 That's fine.

0:22:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:22:42	SPEAKER_02
 And should I get into actually philosophy as well?

0:22:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, sure.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:22:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_02
 So what you want to say is anyone who wants to give a talk on logic or philosophy of language, but put a warning that if it's logic, then there's a good chance that...

0:23:05	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, I understand.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_02
...or not that many.

0:23:08	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, maybe, just, maybe if you just put...

0:23:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, just put philosophy of language.

0:23:16	SPEAKER_02
 That's probably good.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I'll just...

0:23:19	SPEAKER_01
 And you send them the thing, same language as the language department is having a postgraduate thing.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_01
 So if you're a philosophy student with, you know, your work has got an interest in language, then...

0:23:29	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's all you do.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:32	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's as much as we need to say.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_02
 That's right.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 So you've got to work out...

0:23:36	SPEAKER_02
 How's it going?

0:23:38	SPEAKER_01
 Basically, I'm thinking, who's...

0:23:40	SPEAKER_01
 Just sending them your call for papers and changing it slightly to say, yeah, philosophy students.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's fine.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_02
 That's fine.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_02
 That's what you want to do.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_02
 As long as it's clear from the subject bar that it's relevant to them and that it says somewhere that...

0:23:57	SPEAKER_02
...for philosophy students with an interest in language and that's it.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_02
 And then between us, we'll have to have another meeting and...

0:24:03	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, at the same time as we're sorting through all the other titles and deciding...

0:24:08	SPEAKER_02
...how to divide up the sessions.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_02
 See, someone suggested to me that it's actually better to have talks on a similar topic spread out as much as possible, which to me just seemed absolutely crazy.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_02
 And the reason she gave me was something to do with taking out like a whole day or a whole afternoon would be quite difficult.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_02
 But I think that balance against the fact that most people want to be able to say, well, look, I can have just this one day off as opposed to what I need an hour over three days.

0:24:40	SPEAKER_02
 You know, an hour or you stay for three days.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_02
 You could end up having to take three afternoons or three mornings or whatever off.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_02
 So I think in general, and also for the sake of the lecturers, I think a lot of the time Simon Kirby's already said to me that anyone, any of his students, he wants to be on the first day, on the Wednesday.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_02
 And that's because I shifted it. I basically had it on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday to begin with.

0:25:05	SPEAKER_02
 And then it moved down twice to Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. So Wednesday is the only day left that he can make.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I see, right. He wants to be there because he can make it.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, so the other thing is when we get some calls, say we have, for instance, three people supervised by Bob Black, then it might be, then we are going to have to...

0:25:28	SPEAKER_02
 Contact Bob and say, Bob, these three of your students are going to be talking.

0:25:34	SPEAKER_02
 Presumably you want to be there. So can you give us a time that would be good for you?

0:25:39	SPEAKER_02
 And then we can put them in a block at one time because he says, yeah, okay, Thursday afternoon, I've got completely free.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_02
 And so I think we do need to stick everyone together, particularly if they've got the same supervisor.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_02
 And it's also good if talks are on the same topic for a whole morning or a whole afternoon because then people will come along and go, oh, this morning, it's all on phonology or this morning, it's all on apply linguistics. And then, okay.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_02
 Mm-hmm.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_02
 As much as possible anyway.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, that's...

0:26:10	SPEAKER_00
 So far, it's just a general statement of interest, what we intend to do, what we actually get to do with C-later when we have this stuff.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:20	SPEAKER_02
 Now, we need, if I'm going to send out this call, we need a deadline for titles. So...

0:26:27	SPEAKER_02
 What should we say? Something like, because we need a deadline for titles and a deadline for abstracts.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_02
 So let's set the latest deadline, the sort of abstracts deadline first because we need to have a meeting and that's going to be when all the real work starts.

0:26:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_02
 So, what's the absolute latest? I mean, maybe the end of...

0:26:57	SPEAKER_00
 Two weeks ahead. End of March.

0:27:00	SPEAKER_02
 End of March might be okay. I'm going away for two weeks on the 4th of April.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_02
 And then I'm coming back just in time for the conference. So any organising, at least stuff where I need to meet physically has to be done before.

0:27:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. And I will be away...

0:27:22	SPEAKER_00
 Probably until Easter. So this actually means we have the week directly after Easter between my coming back and you leaving.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_00
 I tell you one thing.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_02
 It's starting on the Wednesday and the first day back is Tuesday. I think I'm coming back.

0:27:41	SPEAKER_02
 I'm trying to get this right.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_02
 Hopefully I'll be back in time that we'll be able to do something the day before because I think I'm going to be back.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_02
 Might even have to come in the evening, but that's not the end of the world.

0:27:54	SPEAKER_02
 But we might have to set some things up like maybe just get the chairs organised or whatever.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_02
 We might actually have to go into the rooms and get things ready.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_02
 And there's going to be other things like getting the technology ready.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_02
 So not only is there a pressure to have talks that are on a similar topic together, but also if people need the same kind of computer setup, it's good to have them together so we don't have to keep changing it.

0:28:23	SPEAKER_02
 Because I think it was Cedric who's already offered to do whatever we need him to do, but he just needs to know in advance what people need so that he can be there and get it ready for them.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_02
 So I think when people are actually going to need, well, hopefully most people will either have something like PowerPoint or they'll just have a PDF slides or something.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_02
 Hopefully no one will have anything too specialised.

0:28:54	SPEAKER_00
 In my experience with what you usually should have is some kind of overhead.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_00
 I think it will be more.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_00
 In some cases, if it's really tough, we might be in need of some sound system.

0:29:14	SPEAKER_01
 If you do it, it hasn't really been done.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_02
 It's got a lot in there.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_02
 I think it does take a little bit of interesting.

0:29:22	SPEAKER_02
 I think sometimes maybe people need to be in Linux rather than Windows.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_02
 So booting it out.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_02
 It's sometimes an issue I think.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_02
 But I think what we should say is when I put out this call, I'll put both deadlines.

0:29:39	SPEAKER_02
 I think I'll say that when you send in your abstract, you need to mention any technology you intend to use.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_02
 So at least we have all the information.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah?

0:29:49	SPEAKER_02
 So deadlines.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so let's think about this. If we gave them a whole month or just over a month, then that would be okay, wouldn't it?

0:30:04	SPEAKER_02
 Because we've still got... Oh no, it wouldn't be okay at all.

0:30:08	SPEAKER_02
 If we gave them the whole month, that would give us hardly any time.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_02
 So if we gave them say till mid-March, that would be good.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_02
 Give them something like 10 days or whatever to get the title in.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_02
 And then give them a week on top of that to get the actual abstract done.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_02
 And the abstract doesn't have to be much.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_02
 It's probably only half a side of A4 or something, isn't it?

0:30:33	SPEAKER_02
 It's just enough that we can see whether it's interesting or what kind of area it fits into.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_02
 That's all we really need.

0:30:40	SPEAKER_02
 See, ideally I would like to have given them a bit longer.

0:30:47	SPEAKER_02
 But I think that would be an early one.

0:30:51	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_02
 So unfortunately I don't have a calendar.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_02
 So what do you say?

0:31:00	SPEAKER_01
 You're going to send that band crazy.

0:31:05	SPEAKER_02
 That's true.

0:31:07	SPEAKER_02
 No, I think it's okay when you're not around.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:31:20	SPEAKER_02
 31.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_02
 Oh no, it's 28.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_02
 Isn't that...

0:31:30	SPEAKER_02
 It's not...

0:31:40	SPEAKER_02
 Quickly, yeah.

0:31:41	SPEAKER_02
 So if we have it like a Monday, the 14th would probably be quite good for the final deadline.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_02
 And then if I send it out tomorrow, we'll say something like the...

0:31:57	SPEAKER_02
 The fourth would be good.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_02
 A week for the title.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_02
 And then they would have about 10 days from then to actually get the abstract in.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_02
 Does that sound reasonable?

0:32:10	SPEAKER_01
 Why not just give them a week to the abstract?

0:32:13	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, I'm just thinking about...

0:32:16	SPEAKER_02
 Just put it here, yeah, the 11th bit earlier.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_02
 So I'm saying a week to the last single band.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_01
 I was saying just give them a bit longer to get back with the title.

0:32:24	SPEAKER_01
 Or do we need 10 days to get...

0:32:27	SPEAKER_02
 That would be a week anyway.

0:32:29	SPEAKER_02
 But you can give them 10 days to get the title.

0:32:32	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, yeah.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_02
 It depends which way around you want to do it.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_02
 So what's going to take them longer actually to decide what they're going to do and send the title?

0:32:40	SPEAKER_02
 Or is it going to be on the basis of the title?

0:32:43	SPEAKER_02
 Do they want more time to write the abstract?

0:32:46	SPEAKER_00
 I think if they're really serious to be a bit late with the title might not be bad because it will help them to...

0:32:55	SPEAKER_02
 So given the 7th, yeah.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:32:58	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:33:01	SPEAKER_02
 So Monday the 7th is the title and this presumably will apply across the board.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_02
 And Monday the 14th for the abstract.

0:33:12	SPEAKER_01
 We've got an email address and sent all this to him.

0:33:15	SPEAKER_02
 Or was it...

0:33:16	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we kind of have.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_02
 We were given...

0:33:22	SPEAKER_00
...gatching access to the account.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_02
 The only thing is accessing the account.

0:33:28	SPEAKER_02
 They can send it to PGC at Ling.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_02
 As long as we can get the...

0:33:33	SPEAKER_02
 I'll tell you what I'll do then.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_02
 I'll go and see Mike to die.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_02
 And get the password and everything.

0:33:41	SPEAKER_02
 Because we possibly have it, but I'll just sort that out with him.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_02
 Because if we're going to tell everyone to email PGC, then we have to make pretty sure that we can actually access the account and then it's operational and stuff.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_02
 Because so far I've just been using my own email address, but it will be better.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_02
 It's quite easy to send from an email address.

0:34:01	SPEAKER_02
 Because you can send from any email address you like.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_02
 It's just the fact that you need to...

0:34:05	SPEAKER_02
 It's just the fact that when they reply to it, you need to be able to access it.

0:34:09	SPEAKER_02
 So I already tried it once and I'm sure they gave us a password and I even...

0:34:14	SPEAKER_02
 I'll ask it.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_02
 We've got it all.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_00
 That's it.

0:34:21	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:34:22	SPEAKER_02
 I mean...

0:34:29	SPEAKER_02
 You may already know, but the thing is if you want to send this call for abstracts, when you do the philosophy and thing you want, then if you want to send from PGC, then you might already know.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_02
 But you can go... If you did it from webmail, you can just create a new account for yourself.

0:34:45	SPEAKER_02
 Where it says it actually has a send from address and you can just put PGC out of link and just do it that way.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_02
 Or depending on your normal email client, you might be able to do it.

0:34:55	SPEAKER_02
 But it doesn't matter too much.

0:34:57	SPEAKER_02
 The other thing you could do is just fill in the reply to address as PGC, depending on what you want to do.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_02
 But that's what I'll do.

0:35:06	SPEAKER_02
 I'll send it from PGC.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_02
 So if anyone replies, it will just go to that account and any of us can access it at any time.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_02
 Presumably you can access this up from webmail or, you know, or IMAP or whatever.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_00
 Should I take care of the web page?

0:35:22	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, if you want to create a web page and just copy my email into it or something and anything else you might want to do.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:35:30	SPEAKER_02
 And then later on we can put the program in.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_01
 Cool.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_02
 So.

0:35:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:35:59	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:36:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:01	SPEAKER_02
 It's not quite two or three minutes to.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:36:06	SPEAKER_02
 So very quickly then, can we arrange a new time to have a meeting?

0:36:12	SPEAKER_02
 Do you think we need to?

0:36:15	SPEAKER_02
 How long do you think until we need to meet again?

0:36:17	SPEAKER_02
 Are we going off to be getting on with?

0:36:19	SPEAKER_02
 We probably have, haven't we?

0:36:21	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, that's just.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_02
 So, I mean, maybe, I mean, ideally, I suppose we'll meet again here so we can arrange with Melissa and.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:36:31	SPEAKER_02
 We'll just send that an email.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_01
 That would be cool.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_01
 So, I mean, I wouldn't get in touch with the plus or I won't send anything to plus your informatics till I've got your email.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_01
 I'll just, and that's right.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_01
 A modified version of that.

0:36:44	SPEAKER_01
 But I'll try and get a good address to send it to.

0:36:51	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_01
 So that was a note.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_01
 And I'm okay.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_00
 I think latest, as soon as the call is out.

0:37:02	None
 Yeah.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_00
 Because then we have the call thing.

0:37:06	SPEAKER_00
 We have that way and look at the board.

0:37:09	SPEAKER_00
 Organisitorial stuff like.

0:37:12	SPEAKER_00
 Do we know about chairs, tea and stuff?

0:37:18	SPEAKER_01
 All right.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_01
 We finished.

0:37:20	None
 Okay.
