0:00:00	None
 I don't know.

0:00:07	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to go.

0:00:19	SPEAKER_03
 Was the questioner supposed to be filled in before or after the matter?

0:00:24	SPEAKER_03
 We just got a third one.

0:00:26	SPEAKER_03
 Do you want us to do it really fast or wait?

0:00:33	None
 Okay.

0:00:33	None
 Oh, yeah.

0:00:52	None
 That was quick.

0:00:59	None
 Okay.

0:01:06	None
 Okay.

0:01:13	None
 Oh, there we go.

0:01:25	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:27	SPEAKER_03
 Welcome to our second meeting.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_03
 This is the functional design meeting.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_03
 And I hope you all had a good individual working time.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_03
 Let's get started.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_03
 Here's the agenda for the meeting.

0:01:39	SPEAKER_03
 After the opening, I am going to fulfill the role of secretary.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_03
 Take the meeting minutes.

0:01:47	SPEAKER_03
 Then we're going to have three presentations, one from each of you.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_03
 Then we're going to discuss some new project requirements.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_03
 Going to come to a decision on the functions of their mode control.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_03
 And then we're going to close up the meeting.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_03
 And we're going to do this all in about 40 minutes.

0:02:03	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_03
 First, I want to discuss the goals of this meeting.

0:02:07	SPEAKER_03
 First, we need to determine the user requirements.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_03
 And the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_03
 And then we're going to determine the technical functions.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_03
 What is the effect of the apparatus?

0:02:24	SPEAKER_03
 What actually is it supposed to do?

0:02:26	SPEAKER_03
 What do people pick up a remote and use it for?

0:02:31	SPEAKER_03
 And then lastly, we're going to determine its working design.

0:02:35	SPEAKER_03
 How exactly will it perform its functions?

0:02:37	SPEAKER_03
 That's the whole technical side of.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_03
 I'll just give you a minute because it looks like you're making some notes.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, well let's go ahead and...

0:02:55	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to go back.

0:02:58	SPEAKER_03
 So what I want to do right now is hear from all three of you on your research that you just did.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_03
 Who would like to start us off?

0:03:10	SPEAKER_01
 On the line going first.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:03:13	SPEAKER_03
 Do you have a PowerPoint or no?

0:03:15	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it should be in the...

0:03:17	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to do our PowerPoint now.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_01
 You can do it yourself actually.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, did you send it?

0:03:23	SPEAKER_04
 Save it in the project documents?

0:03:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:03:26	None
 Okay.

0:03:27	None
 This one?

0:03:30	None
 Sure.

0:03:32	None
 Okay.

0:03:33	None
 Yeah.

0:03:34	None
 Okay.

0:03:35	None
 Okay.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_03
 Great.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:03:39	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:03:40	None
 Okay.

0:03:41	None
 Okay.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:03:43	None
 Okay.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:03:47	None
 Great.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, the function of a remote control as we've been informed is basically to send messages to the television side.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_01
 For example, switch it on, switch it off, go to this channel, go to channel nine, turn the volume up, etc.

0:04:10	SPEAKER_01
 So, some of the considerations is just, for example, what it needs to include is the numbers, you know, zero to nine, so you can move to channel.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_01
 The power button on slash off.

0:04:23	SPEAKER_01
 The channel going up and down, volume going up and down, and then mute.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_01
 And mute function.

0:04:32	SPEAKER_01
 And then functions for VHS DVD, for example, play, rewind, fast forward stop pause, enter, and enter would be for like, you know, the menu.

0:04:39	SPEAKER_01
 And then other menus for DB as well as TV, whether that means like we can go and decide the brightness of the screen, things like that, all the more complicated functions of menus.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_01
 And we can decide if that's what we want.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_01
 If we want to include that on the remote, or if that's something that would stay on the TV itself, for example.

0:05:01	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_01
 These are two examples, and you can see on the left, it's got a lot more buttons, and I don't know if you can read it, but it says step, go to freeze, slow repeat program mute.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_01
 And so there's just some of the buttons, and so it gives you an idea, one example, and then on the right, it's a lot more simpler, it's got volume, it's got the play, like circle set, which is play rewind, but it's also what is fast forward is also like next on a menu.

0:05:35	SPEAKER_01
 So you have functions that are duplicating.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_01
 And you have a mute button in the numbers, and the eject and the power button, so that gives you two different kinds of more complex and more simple version.

0:05:49	SPEAKER_01
 And then lastly, it's just the questions that we want to consider, like what functions do we want it to include, and how simple complex it should be, and what functions it needs to complete.

0:06:01	SPEAKER_01
 What are needed to complete the installation process, because it's something that also has to be considered, and it's going to be hopefully a one time thing when you set it up should be set to go, but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up in the first place.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so that's it.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_03
 Very good presentation.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_03
 Speak with such authority on the menu.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, who would like to follow that one up?

0:06:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that we just go. Okay.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_03
 Do you want me to run it or you want to run it? Okay.

0:06:37	SPEAKER_03
 Do you do functional requirements?

0:06:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_03
 Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yes. Okay, so we tested 100 subjects in our lab, and we just we watched them, and we also made them fill out a questionnaire and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_02
 75% think they're ugly.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_02
 80% want they are willing to spend more, which is good news for us.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_02
 If we make it look fancier.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_02
 And basically we just need something that really I mean there's some other points up there, but they need to be snazzy and but yet simple. So that's really what we need to do.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_02
 And we need we need it to be simple yet.

0:07:35	SPEAKER_02
 It needs to be high-tech looking.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_02
 So that like they like I guess use the buttons a lot.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know. It's from my research.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, my team wasn't very clear. Oh, sorry.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_03
 What do you mean by the current remote controls not match well the operating behavior of the user like I think it's like the engineering versus user.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_02
 Whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained over because they only use 10% of the buttons.

0:08:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, we use 10% of our brains.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_04
 Good point.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_02
 It works.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_02
 It's a necessary tool.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_02
 Ready for the next five.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_02
 And so people say that they typically lose it as you yourself know because you probably lose your remote control the time much like any small planes like cell phone.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_02
 And they we need something simple because most people well 34% say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one and we don't want to go.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_02
 We don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_02
 I mean they do need to be able to identify it and or I am not very sure what that is.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_02
 It's okay.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_02
 It's very important.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_02
 It is important for the remote control world.

0:08:57	SPEAKER_01
 Is that like ergonomics like your hand movement system?

0:09:02	SPEAKER_02
 It could be.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_02
 Possibly.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe really need to provide more information on what RS I am.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's what my website said.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's a pretty good guess though.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I would assume so.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_02
 I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts.

0:09:19	SPEAKER_02
 But also so the channel the volume and the power buttons are most important on our company website.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_02
 You can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_02
 But those are the definitely the top ones.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_02
 Next slide.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_02
 And so personally I think that we need a modern eye catching design but it really needs to be simple.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_02
 So saying from your site, your presentation, the engineering versus the user specified or modes.

0:09:52	SPEAKER_02
 I think that we should go with something that's more user friendly where the engineering ones, the boxes tend to make it look more complicated than it really is.

0:10:01	SPEAKER_02
 The functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it.

0:10:09	SPEAKER_02
 And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers.

0:10:12	SPEAKER_02
 So even though we need a small number of buttons, we also need to take in like our most people going to be using it for a DVD player or a TVO.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_02
 So what exactly are we using it for as well as the age range.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_02
 So we need a hip but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_02
 And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up and coming thing.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_02
 They really consumers are really interested in it.

0:10:42	SPEAKER_02
 And since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high class.

0:10:49	SPEAKER_03
 Just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say channel 5 and I guess so.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_01
 I had to just say where are you?

0:11:00	SPEAKER_01
 I guess we can interpret it.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_02
 We can just try out different types of speech recognition with an R.

0:11:07	SPEAKER_03
 Didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on TV and it would promote with beeps so that if you ever lost it.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_03
 We can just use a remote phone.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_01
 Oh yeah.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_03
 That's true.

0:11:21	SPEAKER_03
 We could definitely include that if we wanted to.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_03
 If it's within our race.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_03
 Are we ready for our last presentation?

0:11:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I'm just trying to move it.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_04
 I think it should be there.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_04
 Working design.

0:11:45	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_04
 I didn't get a chance to complete this one because some of the tools that I was giving more frustrate.

0:11:53	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, that's fine.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:56	SPEAKER_04
 So.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_04
 Method.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_04
 Method of our design.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_04
 I think I just started listing some of the things that we actually need to put into this.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_04
 We need a power source.

0:12:05	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to need a smart chip if we're going to make it multifunctional.

0:12:10	SPEAKER_04
 Extra functions will probably need an additional chip either that or this smart chip will have to be extremely smart.

0:12:20	SPEAKER_02
 What exactly is a smart chip?

0:12:22	SPEAKER_04
 Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_01
 Well, how much extra would the additional chip be?

0:12:32	SPEAKER_01
 Is that going to push us over our production costs?

0:12:35	SPEAKER_04
 I wouldn't think so because we could probably get it from bulk from a newer company and they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yep.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_04
 Nothing here.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_04
 That's okay.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_04
 Power source.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_04
 I figured batteries because they're easily available.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_04
 Typically, remote has either two double A's or four triple A's, sometimes three.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_04
 It really kind of depends on the size of the actual remote itself.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_04
 A large on off button demographically, we're moving towards an older generation of people, so a large on off button would probably be good.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_04
 Selection button for various entertainment devices, so you want something that will permit you to select the DVD player or the TV or the stereo system.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_04
 A smart chip that permits, sorry, universal application.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_04
 Again, something that will allow us to skip over between devices.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_04
 That's kind of it.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_04
 This is my 52nd design.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_04
 Power source over here.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to have a switch, obviously, between the power source and the rest of it.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_04
 You're going to need the switch.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_04
 Extra bulb could just be for flashiness.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_04
 Subcomponent, which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the device.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_04
 The chip and, of course, the infrared bulb, so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to you.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_02
 So what exactly are you looking at?

0:14:17	SPEAKER_02
 Is this like the front of the...

0:14:18	SPEAKER_04
 This is just like a rough schematic.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_03
 So this is the internal workings.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_03
 So the red would be the front of the remote, though.

0:14:25	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 That's going to be what's communicating with the TV, but the other bulb, I think, is good just to indicate I'm doing something sort of like a...

0:14:33	SPEAKER_04
 We don't have to stare at that infrared because, you know, when the battery starts dying on your remote, currently you have to actually stare at that bulb and go, okay, when I push this button, is it working?

0:14:44	SPEAKER_04
 We can skip that whole thing, right?

0:14:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:14:48	SPEAKER_04
 So you can put it in the dark.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's good.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_03
 We should make a glow in the dark.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, definitely.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, next.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's it.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_03
 Anything you want to add for personal preferences, though?

0:15:02	SPEAKER_03
 You said already that we need a large on-off button, you think.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_04
 I think that that's a good idea because, you know, that's one of the most important buttons.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_01
 Well, should it be larger buttons in general?

0:15:12	SPEAKER_01
 You know, like the examples that I had, they're quite small, so should we try and go for something that has larger buttons?

0:15:19	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_02
 Like, I think that would be an, like, for the design, sorry.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote because most remotes have small square buttons.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should do something like bigger and round.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_02
 Like, almost.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, let's talk about all of our.

0:15:38	SPEAKER_03
 We'll come to a decision later about all the components that we need to include.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_03
 Let's wrap up this one and I'm going to go back to my PowerPoint because we need to discuss the new project requirements, which you might have already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_03
 Wait.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_03
 Come back.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_03
 Let's go through this.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_03
 Here we go.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_03
 New product requirements.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_03
 First, it's only going to be a TV remote.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_03
 We're trying not to over-complicate things.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_03
 So no DVD, no Tivo, no stereo.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_03
 It's not going to be multifunctional.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_03
 Hey, and we need to promote our company more.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_03
 So we need to somehow include our color and our company slogan on the remote.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_03
 We're trying to get our name out there in the world.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_03
 And you know what teletext is?

0:16:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:16:37	SPEAKER_03
 In the States, we don't have it, but it's like they just have this channel where it just has news and weather kind of sports.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_03
 It's very bland looking.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_03
 It's just text on the screen.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_00
 Not even black with text.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_03
 Like running along the bottom.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_04
 You can also get the kind of the TV guide.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_02
 Wait, is it like the weather channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom?

0:16:59	SPEAKER_01
 It's the entire screen.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_04
 It's the entire screen.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_04
 It's just running information.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_04
 You can see me.

0:17:05	SPEAKER_01
 So anyway, you can pick the news, entertainment.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_03
 So it's like a separate channel from like what I'm watching.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_03
 But it's becoming outdated now because of the internet.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_03
 Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_03
 And we have 24 hour news channels now too.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_03
 So those are our new product requirements.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_04
 So do we have to include the company color within that?

0:17:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_03
 It's part of the logo.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_01
 Company color being yellow.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_03
 What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions definitive that we can all agree on about the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_03
 And then we'll close up the meeting.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:17:51	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_03
 So our target group is you mentioned older people.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_03
 Would it just be universal for everyone you think because I think even if something has large buttons as long as they're not childishly large, like even technically non technically challenged people are going to use it.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, they want something user friendly.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_04
 So well, even if we kept the regular standard size of remote, if we reduce the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra, because they're saying they only use 10% of them.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_04
 Then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_03
 So we want for our target group, would we say, I mean, young and old, all age ranges, all not kids, obviously, right?

0:18:53	SPEAKER_02
 No, kids need to know how to use a remote.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_02
 Most of them will into a picture between Disney channel, Cartoon Network.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_03
 So we're going to go anywhere.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think we need to adult in the age range.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_03
 What about technical specifications, like how, how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our vote.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_02
 I would say we should say dumber than the average person.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_01
 Go for the lowest denominator.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_03
 High school.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_03
 So they need no technical experience to operate.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_04
 How about little to no, because there's no way that you're going to be able to make it no.

0:19:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:55	SPEAKER_03
 And we also need to determine the specific functions of this just to get it all out on paper.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_03
 So we said it needs to send messages to the TV, needs to change the channel, turn on and off, just basic simple stuff like this.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_01
 So if you have something, just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_03
 Those are the most important ones.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_03
 And we want to keep, I'll make a note here that we want to keep the number buttons down.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_03
 Correct?

0:20:27	SPEAKER_03
 Because people only use 10%.

0:20:29	None
 Yeah.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_03
 Hey, what else?

0:20:36	SPEAKER_04
 Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily?

0:20:50	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_03
 What do you.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_01
 So what?

0:20:55	SPEAKER_01
 Finding.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_03
 We need to like,

0:20:57	SPEAKER_04
 like, underneath the couch.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_04
 How are we going to accommodate the quick ability to finding?

0:21:04	SPEAKER_02
 Because people really are looking for our mother's more high tech.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_04
 What if we gave it a charger and on the charger, just like a phone, like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger.

0:21:18	SPEAKER_04
 Leave your phone somewhere.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_04
 You push the button to find it.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_04
 It finds.

0:21:23	SPEAKER_04
 Do you think the phone really goes for that though?

0:21:26	SPEAKER_04
 Because useful for the remote phone.

0:21:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_03
 Would that add to our cost though?

0:21:32	SPEAKER_03
 I wonder.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_02
 I would think so because you'd have to develop a base.

0:21:35	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if you have a base, you can start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:41	None
 Mmm.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_04
 Returgical batteries are cheaper usually.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_03
 I think we can make a decision about that later.

0:21:50	SPEAKER_03
 We'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_03
 So that would include battery source.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_03
 Power source rather.

0:21:58	SPEAKER_03
 Is it going to have a charger?

0:22:01	SPEAKER_03
 Or is it going to be run strictly off batteries?

0:22:05	SPEAKER_03
 And we asked the need to deal with the issue that you mentioned of speech recognition if we want.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_01
 If we have the speech recognition, then we can start aiming at it like another kind of more handicapped.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_01
 Disabled demographic.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_02
 Well, there's the people who desire speech recognition.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_02
 The different demographics have different desires.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if you guys can.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_02
 You could, it wouldn't copy onto the things.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_02
 It's black.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_02
 But all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_02
 So basically older people don't really care.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_02
 It's really the people 25 to 35.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_02
 I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of TV though.

0:22:50	SPEAKER_02
 They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and sitcoms.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_03
 And if we introduce it when they're at this stage, they're going to probably always buy a remote that has.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_01
 Then do you put the voice recognition?

0:23:04	SPEAKER_01
 Do you put the receiver on the actual television in the base or in the actual remote?

0:23:08	SPEAKER_01
 Because then you've already got the remote in the hand.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_01
 Why are you just going to speak to the remote?

0:23:12	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_01
 Whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and talk at it.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_03
 Well, and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device too.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_03
 If we said find remote, locate remote or something.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_03
 A certain phrase, then it could be just thrown it out there.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:23:38	SPEAKER_03
 Well.

0:23:43	SPEAKER_01
 15 minutes.

0:23:48	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_01
 Anything else you want to discuss?

0:23:51	SPEAKER_01
 Well, do we want to include the numbers like 0-3-9?

0:23:55	SPEAKER_01
 Can we conceive of leaving them out?

0:23:59	SPEAKER_01
 Wait on the remote itself?

0:24:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_01
 Like you have 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we definitely need those.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_01
 How do you leave those out?

0:24:06	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I don't know.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, if you can conceive, it's like, well, I don't know.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_04
 It's just a way of leaving them out.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_04
 I think people would find that too foreign.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's true.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_03
 And also remember that in this day and age, we need, you know, like a hundred button too.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_03
 I used to have a remote that's not even go up past like 50.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_03
 So I couldn't, whenever I got cable, I had to get a new TV.

0:24:28	SPEAKER_04
 So we need to get to satellite.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, I get your own remote or digital cable.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_03
 I guess we're going to discuss the project financing later, making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget.

0:24:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_03
 So I don't forget we need to include the color of our company and the logo.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_01
 The color being yellow?

0:25:06	SPEAKER_03
 I'm guessing.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_03
 I feel like the double R would be too garish.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_02
 We could just have the logo in yellow or maybe a yellow light for the keys.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_02
 I'll put like stripes.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah, yellow.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yellow could be and it doesn't have to be huge.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, well, if you have like, you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom, the base of it, it's just like yellow with the R.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_03
 So we've simplified, we don't need all those play fast forward, we're wind.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_03
 You know, no menu buttons.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_03
 So we've pretty much pared it down to on off volume mute channel up down the numbers.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_03
 Can we go back to, I'm going to look really quickly back at those two examples and see if there's anything, which one was yours technical functions for functional requirement?

0:26:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_02
 Audio settings and screen settings.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_02
 We need those like audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, screen settings like brightness color.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_02
 Or do we just want that access from television itself?

0:26:25	SPEAKER_03
 I think that that's fine just through the TV.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff?

0:26:32	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the other options sort of like down at the bottom, like farther away, you just have this sort of box in set where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much, but occasionally you will use.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, because we definitely need to have buttons for like subtitles and things like that.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_02
 Because the foreign film market is expanding and stuff.

0:26:51	SPEAKER_02
 And like on television, like I know living in Los Angeles, it's tons of Spanish network television.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_02
 And if it has English subtitles, it's definitely helpful.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_03
 Can we do that off through wind button?

0:27:03	SPEAKER_03
 There's a menu button that pops up with a menu on the TV that says audio, video, whatever language.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_02
 So we need up, down and side to side buttons for the menu.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's what you know you can just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_01
 The channel's just up and down.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, yeah.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_03
 And then something that such as, yeah, the one, you know, the one over there on the left, the engineering center one.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_02
 Right, right, right.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_01
 So we just have like add a menu button then for the various things needed, including the middle of the mission.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_01
 If we have any like settings for voice recognition, though.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_01
 Included menu.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:27:46	SPEAKER_02
 We just got an idea for design.

0:27:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:28:02	SPEAKER_03
 Anybody have anything else I'd like to bring up in this meeting?

0:28:06	SPEAKER_04
 I had something, but I forgot.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_03
 Get out of here.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_03
 Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_03
 After this meeting, we're going to be sent a questionnaire and summary again, which we need to reply to that email.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_03
 And then we're going to have lunch break.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_03
 And after lunch, 30 minutes of individual work time.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to put the minutes, I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the product documents folder.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_03
 If you'd like to review them and I'm going to type up the minutes for this one as well.

0:28:45	SPEAKER_03
 Here's what we're each going to do.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_03
 The ID is going to work on the components concept.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_03
 UID, the user interface concept, and you're going to do some try and watch it.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_03
 Hey, specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach.

0:29:02	SPEAKER_03
 And if anybody has anything they would like to add?

0:29:06	SPEAKER_03
 No?

0:29:07	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_03
 Well, this meeting is officially over.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you all.
