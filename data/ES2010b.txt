0:00:00	None
 I'm going to go.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_01
 Was the questioner supposed to be filled in before after the winter?

0:00:24	SPEAKER_03
 We just got a third one. Do you want us to do it really fast?

0:00:30	SPEAKER_03
 Or wait.

0:00:36	None
 Okay.

0:00:42	None
 Oh yeah, that was quick.

0:00:58	None
 Okay.

0:01:06	None
 Okay.

0:01:16	None
 There we go.

0:01:24	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_03
 Welcome to our second meeting.

0:01:28	SPEAKER_03
 This is the functional design meeting.

0:01:30	SPEAKER_03
 And I hope you all had a good individual working time.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. Let's get started.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. Here's the agenda for the meeting.

0:01:38	SPEAKER_03
 After the opening, I am going to fulfill the role of secretary.

0:01:44	SPEAKER_03
 Take the meeting minutes.

0:01:46	SPEAKER_03
 Then we're going to have three presentations, one from each of you.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_03
 Then we're going to discuss some new project requirements.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_03
 Going to come to decision on the functions of their remote control.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_03
 And then we're going to close up the meeting.

0:01:58	SPEAKER_03
 And we're going to do this on about 40 minutes.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_03
 First, I want to discuss the goals of this meeting.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_03
 First, we need to determine the user requirements.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_03
 And the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control.

0:02:18	SPEAKER_03
 And then we're going to determine the technical functions.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_03
 What is the effect of the apparatus?

0:02:24	SPEAKER_03
 What actually is it supposed to do?

0:02:26	SPEAKER_03
 What do people pick up a remote and use it for?

0:02:30	SPEAKER_03
 And then lastly, we're going to determine its working design.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_03
 How exactly will it perform its functions?

0:02:36	SPEAKER_03
 That's the whole technical side of.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_03
 I'll just give you a minute because it looks like you're making some notes.

0:02:46	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:50	SPEAKER_03
 Oh.

0:02:52	SPEAKER_03
 Well, let's go ahead and...

0:02:54	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to click.

0:02:56	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to click.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_03
 So what I want to do right now is hear from all three of you on your research that you just did.

0:03:06	SPEAKER_03
 Who would like to start us off?

0:03:10	SPEAKER_01
 I don't like going first.

0:03:12	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_03
 Do you have a PowerPoint or no?

0:03:16	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it should be in the...

0:03:18	SPEAKER_01
 Do you want to do our PowerPoints now?

0:03:20	SPEAKER_01
 You can do it yourself actually.

0:03:22	SPEAKER_04
 Oh.

0:03:23	SPEAKER_04
 Did you send it?

0:03:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:03:26	None
 Okay.

0:03:28	None
 Mm-hmm.

0:03:30	None
 Mm-hmm.

0:03:32	None
 This one?

0:03:34	None
 Sure.

0:03:36	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:03:40	None
 Okay.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_01
 Great.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_04
 Well, the function of a remote control as...

0:03:48	SPEAKER_01
 We've been informed is basically to send messages to the television side.

0:03:58	SPEAKER_01
 For example, switch it on.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_01
 Switch it off.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_01
 Go to this channel.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_01
 Go to channel nine.

0:04:06	None
 Turn the volume up, etc.

0:04:08	SPEAKER_01
 Some of the considerations is just...

0:04:12	SPEAKER_01
 For example, what it needs to include is the numbers.

0:04:16	SPEAKER_01
 There are zero to nine, so you can move to channel.

0:04:18	SPEAKER_01
 The power button on, slash off.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_01
 The channel going up and down.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_01
 Volume going up and down.

0:04:28	SPEAKER_01
 And then mute.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_01
 And then, functions for VHS DVD.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_01
 For example, play rewind fast-forward stop-pause.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_01
 Enter.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_01
 And enter would be for like, you know, the menus.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_01
 And then, other menus for DVD as well as TV.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_01
 Whether that means like, we can go and decide the brightness of the screen.

0:04:49	SPEAKER_01
 Things like that.

0:04:51	SPEAKER_01
 All the more complicated functions with menus.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_01
 And we can decide if that's what we want in it.

0:04:57	SPEAKER_01
 If we want to include that in the remote or if that's something that would stay on the TV itself, for example.

0:05:03	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_01
 These are two examples.

0:05:06	SPEAKER_01
 And you can see on the left, it's got a lot more buttons.

0:05:09	SPEAKER_01
 And I don't know if you can read it, but it says, step.

0:05:12	SPEAKER_01
 So, to freeze, slow, repeat, program, mute.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_01
 And so, there's some of the buttons.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_01
 And so, you see an idea.

0:05:23	SPEAKER_01
 One example.

0:05:24	SPEAKER_01
 And then, on the right, it's a lot more simpler.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_01
 It's got volume.

0:05:27	SPEAKER_01
 It's got the play, like circle set, which is play rewind.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_01
 But it's also, what is fast forward is also like next on a menu.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_01
 So, you have functions that are duplicating.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_01
 And you have a mute button in the numbers, and the adact in the power button.

0:05:43	SPEAKER_01
 So, that gives you two different kinds of more complex and more simple version.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_01
 Ready?

0:05:49	SPEAKER_01
 And then, lastly, it's just the questions that we want to consider.

0:05:53	SPEAKER_01
 Like, what functions do we want it to include and how simple complex it should be?

0:05:58	SPEAKER_01
 And what functions it needs to complete?

0:06:02	SPEAKER_01
 What I needed to complete the installation process, because, you know, it also has to be considered, and it's going to be, hopefully, one time thing.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_01
 When you set it up, it should be set to go.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_01
 But we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up in the first place.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, so that's it.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:06:21	SPEAKER_03
 Very good presentation.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you.

0:06:24	SPEAKER_03
 I speak with such authority on the menu.

0:06:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:06:29	SPEAKER_03
 Who would like to follow that one up?

0:06:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that we just go.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:06:34	SPEAKER_03
 Do you want me to run it or do you want me to run it?

0:06:36	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you should run it.

0:06:37	None
 Okay.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_03
 You do.

0:06:40	SPEAKER_03
 Functional requirements?

0:06:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:06:51	SPEAKER_03
 Now, we have Courtney with the Functional requirements.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_02
 So, we tested 100 subjects in our lab, and we just, we watched them, and we also made them fill out a questionnaire, and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_02
 75% think they're ugly, 80%.

0:07:12	SPEAKER_02
 What they are willing to spend more, which is good news for us, if we make it look fancier.

0:07:19	SPEAKER_02
 And basically, we just need something that really, I mean, there's some other points of there.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_02
 But they, it needs to be schnazzy, but yet simple.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_02
 So, that's really what we need to do.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_02
 And we need, we need it to be simple, yet it needs to be high-tech looking.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_02
 So, like, they, like, I guess, use the buttons a lot.

0:07:43	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:07:45	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know.

0:07:46	SPEAKER_02
 It's from my research.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_02
 Why team wasn't very clear.

0:07:50	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, sorry.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_03
 What do you mean by the current remote controls not match well, the operating behavior of the user?

0:07:58	SPEAKER_02
 I think it's like the engineering versus user.

0:08:01	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:08:02	SPEAKER_02
 Whereas, like, the engineering, she showed that the engineering ones are more complex.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:08:07	SPEAKER_02
 And users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained over there.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:08:12	SPEAKER_02
 Because they only use 10% of the buttons, really.

0:08:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_04
 They only use 10% of their brains.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_04
 Good points.

0:08:18	SPEAKER_02
 It works.

0:08:19	SPEAKER_02
 It's a necessary people.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:08:21	SPEAKER_02
 Ready for the next slide.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_02
 And so, people say that they typically lose it as you yourself know, because you probably lose your remote control all the time, much like any small, small, or even like a cell phone.

0:08:33	SPEAKER_02
 And they, we need something simple, because most people, well, 34% say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_02
 And we don't want to go.

0:08:44	SPEAKER_02
 We don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote.

0:08:48	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, they do need to be able to identify it.

0:08:53	SPEAKER_02
 And RSI, I'm not very sure what that is.

0:08:55	SPEAKER_02
 It's important for the remote control world.

0:09:00	SPEAKER_01
 Organomics like your hand movement, so should I?

0:09:02	SPEAKER_02
 Could be.

0:09:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_04
 Possibly.

0:09:05	SPEAKER_04
 Maybe really needs to provide more information on what RSI is.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's what my website said.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_03
 I think that's a pretty good guess, though.

0:09:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I would assume so.

0:09:15	SPEAKER_02
 I think we're supposed to know as remote control experts.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_02
 But also, so the channel, the volume, and the power buttons are the most important.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_02
 On our company website, you can find, like the specific statistics concerning how much each button is used.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_02
 But those are the, definitely the top ones.

0:09:34	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:09:35	SPEAKER_02
 Next slide.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:09:37	SPEAKER_02
 And so, personally, I think that we need a modern eye catching design, but it really needs to be simple.

0:09:43	SPEAKER_02
 So, saying from your site, your presentation, the engineering versus the user specified remote.

0:09:51	SPEAKER_02
 I think that we should go with something that's more user friendly.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_02
 Where the engineering ones, the boxes tend to make it look more complicated than it really is.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_02
 The functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons we really need on it.

0:10:08	SPEAKER_02
 And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_02
 So, even though we need a small number of buttons, we also need to take in like our most people going to be using it for a DVD player or a TVO.

0:10:21	SPEAKER_02
 What exactly are we using it for as well as the age range.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_02
 So, we need a hip, but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product.

0:10:32	SPEAKER_02
 And also, we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up and coming thing.

0:10:38	SPEAKER_02
 They really, consumers are really interested in it.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_02
 And since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for our remote, for it to be more high class.

0:10:48	SPEAKER_02
 And so, just consider it.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_03
 Just to clarify by speech recognition, you mean they would say channel five and the thing would go.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_03
 I guess so.

0:10:56	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_01
 I have to just say where are you?

0:10:59	SPEAKER_01
 I think the beach, you know?

0:11:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I guess we can interpret it.

0:11:02	SPEAKER_02
 Like, we can just try out different types of speech recognition.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_03
 Didn't our rival company's manufacturer remote that you would press the button on the TV and it would remote would beep so that if you ever lost it.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_03
 It's a lot of remote phone you should have.

0:11:18	SPEAKER_03
 Oh yeah, that's true.

0:11:19	SPEAKER_03
 You could definitely include that if we wanted to.

0:11:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_03
 If it's within our rice.

0:11:25	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_03
 I'm ready for our last presentation.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I'm just trying to move it.

0:11:30	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, I think it should be there.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_04
 Working design.

0:11:46	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:11:47	SPEAKER_04
 I didn't get a chance to complete this one.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so, I think it's a little bit more interesting because some of the tools that I was given were frustrating.

0:11:58	SPEAKER_04
 That was fun.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so method method of our design.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_04
 I think I just started listing some of the things that we actually need to put into this.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_04
 We need a power source.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to need a smart chip if we're going to make it multifunctional.

0:12:14	SPEAKER_04
 Extra functions will probably need an additional chip.

0:12:17	SPEAKER_04
 Either that or this smart chip will have to be extremely smart.

0:12:19	SPEAKER_02
 What exactly is a smart chip?

0:12:21	SPEAKER_04
 Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_01
 Well, how much extra would the additional chip be?

0:12:32	SPEAKER_01
 Is that going to push us over our production costs?

0:12:35	SPEAKER_04
 I wouldn't think so because we could probably get it from like a bulk from a newer company.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_04
 They tend to sell their chips pretty cheap.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_04
 Ready?

0:12:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yep.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_04
 Nothing here.

0:12:49	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:12:50	SPEAKER_04
 Power source.

0:12:51	SPEAKER_04
 I figured batteries because they're easily available.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_04
 Typically remote has either two double A's or four triple A's.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_04
 Sometimes three.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_04
 Really kind of depends on the size of the actual remote itself.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_04
 A large on-off button.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_04
 Demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people.

0:13:13	SPEAKER_04
 So a large on-off button would probably be good.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_04
 The selection button for various entertainment devices.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_04
 So you want something that will permit you to select the DVD player or the TV or the stereo system.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_04
 Smart chip that permits, sorry, universal application.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_04
 Again, something that will allow us to skip over between devices.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_04
 That's kind of it.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_04
 This is my 52nd design.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_04
 Power source over here.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to have a switch, obviously, between the power source and the rest of it.

0:13:54	SPEAKER_04
 You're going to need the switch.

0:13:56	SPEAKER_04
 Extra bulb could just be for flashiness.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_04
 Subcomponent, which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the device.

0:14:10	SPEAKER_04
 The chip and, of course, the infrared bulb.

0:14:13	SPEAKER_04
 So it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to.

0:14:16	SPEAKER_02
 So what exactly are we looking at?

0:14:18	SPEAKER_04
 This is just like a rough schematic.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_03
 So this is the internal workings.

0:14:23	SPEAKER_03
 So the red would be the front of the remote, though.

0:14:26	SPEAKER_01
 That's going to be what's communicating with the TV, but the other bulb is good.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_01
 Just to indicate I'm doing something sort of like a...

0:14:34	SPEAKER_04
 We don't have to stare at that infrared because when the battery starts dying on your remote, you have to actually stare at that bulb and go, okay, when I push this button, is it working?

0:14:44	SPEAKER_04
 It probably might skip that whole thing, right?

0:14:47	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, so you can put it in the dark.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's good.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_03
 We should take a little bit dark.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, definitely.

0:14:54	SPEAKER_03
 Hey, next.

0:14:55	SPEAKER_03
 Ready?

0:14:56	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's it.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_03
 Anything you want to add for personal preferences, though?

0:15:02	SPEAKER_03
 You said already that we need a large enough button, you think.

0:15:05	SPEAKER_04
 I think that's a good idea because that's one of the most important buttons.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_01
 Well, should it be larger buttons in general?

0:15:12	SPEAKER_01
 You know, like the examples that I had there are quite small, so should we try and go for something that has larger buttons?

0:15:19	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should.

0:15:20	SPEAKER_02
 I think that would be in for the design, sorry.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like normal remote, because most remote have small square buttons.

0:15:30	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should do something like bigger and round.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, almost.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:36	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, let's talk about all of our...

0:15:39	SPEAKER_03
 We'll come to a decision later about all the components that we need to include.

0:15:42	SPEAKER_03
 Let's wrap up this one, and I'm going to go back to my PowerPoint, because we need to discuss the new project requirements, which you might have already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier.

0:15:53	SPEAKER_03
 Wait.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_03
 Come back.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_03
 Sorry.

0:16:00	SPEAKER_03
 Let's go through this.

0:16:01	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:16:02	SPEAKER_03
 New product requirements.

0:16:04	SPEAKER_03
 First, it's only going to be a TV remote.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_03
 We're trying not to over-complicate things.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_03
 So no DVD, no TV, no stereo.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_03
 It's not going to be multifunctional.

0:16:17	SPEAKER_03
 Hey.

0:16:18	SPEAKER_03
 And we need to promote our company more.

0:16:21	SPEAKER_03
 So we need to somehow include our color and our company slogan on the remote.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_03
 We're trying to get our name out there in the world.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_03
 And you know what teletext is?

0:16:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. In the States, we don't have it.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_03
 But it's like they just have this channel where it just has news and weather kind of sports.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_03
 It's very bland looking.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_03
 It's just text on the screen.

0:16:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_03
 Not even black with writing along the bottom.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:16:53	SPEAKER_04
 You can also get the TV guide.

0:16:55	SPEAKER_02
 Wait.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_02
 Is it like the weather channel where it's got the ticker running on the bottom?

0:16:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_04
 It seems like the entire screen is just running information at random.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_01
 So anyway, it's more like you can pick the news, you can entertain them.

0:17:08	SPEAKER_03
 So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_03
 But it's becoming outdated now because of the internet.

0:17:13	SPEAKER_03
 Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_03
 And we have 24 hour news channels now too.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_03
 So those are our new product requirements.

0:17:21	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_04
 So do we have to include the company color within that?

0:17:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_03
 Let's try the logo.

0:17:30	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:31	SPEAKER_01
 Somebody color being yellow.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_03
 What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions definitive that we can all agree on about the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_03
 And then we'll close up the meeting.

0:17:48	SPEAKER_03
 So.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_03
 So our target group is you mentioned older people.

0:18:11	SPEAKER_03
 Would it just be universal for everyone, you think, because I think even if something has large buttons.

0:18:17	SPEAKER_03
 As long as they're not childishly large, like even technically non-technically challenged people are going to use it.

0:18:25	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, they want something user friendly.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_04
 Well, even if we kept the regular standard size of remote, if we reduce the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_04
 Is they're saying they only use 10% of them.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_04
 Then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons.

0:18:43	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:18:44	SPEAKER_03
 For target group, would we say, I mean, young and old, all age ranges, all not kids, obviously, right?

0:18:55	SPEAKER_02
 No, kids need to know how to use remote.

0:18:58	SPEAKER_02
 Most of them willing to.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_02
 They've got a chance between Disney Channel and Cartoon Network.

0:19:02	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_03
 So we're going to go anywhere.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, I think we need to adult in the age range.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_03
 What about technical specifications, like how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote?

0:19:19	SPEAKER_02
 I would say we should say, dumber than the average person.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_01
 Go for the lowest denominator.

0:19:25	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:26	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:19:27	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_03
 So they need no technical experience to operate.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_04
 How about little to know, because there's no way that you're going to be able to make it.

0:19:36	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_03
 And we also need to determine the specific functions of this, just to get it all out on paper.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_03
 So we said it needs to send messages to the TV, needs to change the channel, turn on and off, just basic simple stuff like this.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_03
 So if you have something, just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_01
 Most channel, on off button volume, volume and channel.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:19	SPEAKER_02
 Those are the most important ones.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_03
 And we want to keep, I'll make a note here that we want to keep the number of buttons down.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_03
 Correct.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_03
 Because people only use 10%.

0:20:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_03
 Hey, what else?

0:20:35	SPEAKER_04
 Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily?

0:20:49	SPEAKER_03
 I think so.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_03
 What do you?

0:20:52	SPEAKER_01
 Sure.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_01
 So what?

0:20:55	SPEAKER_04
 I think we need to, like if this is going to get lost underneath the couch, how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it?

0:21:07	SPEAKER_02
 Because people really are looking for our methods, more high tech.

0:21:12	SPEAKER_04
 What if we gave it a charger?

0:21:14	SPEAKER_04
 And on the charger, just like a phone, like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger and a phone.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_04
 Leave your phone somewhere.

0:21:20	SPEAKER_04
 You push the button to find it.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_04
 And it finds the phone really goes for that though.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_04
 Because it's useful for the remote phone.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:21:31	SPEAKER_03
 Would that add to our cost at all?

0:21:33	SPEAKER_02
 I wonder.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_02
 I would think so because you'd have to develop a base.

0:21:36	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if you have a base, you can start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:43	SPEAKER_04
 And rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_03
 I think we can make a decision about that later.

0:21:53	SPEAKER_03
 Well, still put that as a point that we need to discuss.

0:21:55	None
 So that would include battery source.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_03
 Power source rather.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_03
 Is it going to have a charger?

0:22:01	SPEAKER_03
 Or is it going to be run strictly out of batteries?

0:22:05	SPEAKER_03
 And we also need to deal with the issue that you mentioned of speech recognition.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_03
 If we want.

0:22:11	SPEAKER_01
 If we have a speech recognition, then we can start aiming at it.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_01
 Like another kind of more handicapped disabled demographic.

0:22:21	SPEAKER_02
 Well, there's the people who desire speech recognition.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_02
 There's the different demographics have different desires.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know if you guys can.

0:22:31	SPEAKER_02
 You could, it wouldn't copy onto the things it's black.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_02
 But all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_02
 So basically older people don't really care.

0:22:45	SPEAKER_02
 It's really the people 25 to 35.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_02
 I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of TV though.

0:22:51	SPEAKER_02
 They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas.

0:22:55	SPEAKER_02
 And if it comes.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_03
 And if we introduce it when they're at this age, they're going to probably always buy a remote that has.

0:23:01	SPEAKER_01
 Well, then then do you put voice recognition?

0:23:03	SPEAKER_01
 Do you put the receiver on the actual television in the base or in the actual remote?

0:23:08	SPEAKER_01
 Because then you've already got the mode in the hand.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_01
 Why are you just going to speak to the remote?

0:23:12	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_01
 Whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk after it.

0:23:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_03
 Well, and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device too.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_03
 If we said find remote, locate remote or something.

0:23:27	SPEAKER_03
 A certain phrase.

0:23:29	SPEAKER_03
 Then it could beep.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_03
 Just thrown it out there.

0:23:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:23:34	None
 Wow.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_01
 15 minutes.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:23:45	None
 Anything else you want to discuss?

0:23:48	SPEAKER_01
 Well, do we want to include the numbers like 0, 3, 9?

0:23:52	SPEAKER_01
 Can we conceive and leave them out?

0:23:56	SPEAKER_01
 Wait, on the remote itself?

0:23:58	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:23:59	SPEAKER_01
 Like you have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_01
 Well, we definitely need those.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we need those out.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I don't know.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, if you can conceive, it's like, well, I don't know.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_04
 It's just a way of leaving them out.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_04
 I think people would find that too foreign.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's true.

0:24:16	SPEAKER_03
 And also remember that in this day and age, we need like a hundred button too.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_03
 I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like 50.

0:24:25	SPEAKER_03
 So whenever I got cable, I had to get a new TV.

0:24:30	SPEAKER_04
 So we get sadly.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, so you get your own remote or digital cable.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_03
 I guess we're going to discuss the project financing later, making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment.

0:24:58	SPEAKER_03
 I don't forget we need to include the color of our company and the logo.

0:25:04	SPEAKER_01
 The color being yellow.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_03
 I'm guessing.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_03
 I feel like the yellow army to get rich.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_02
 We could just have the logo in yellow or maybe a yellow light for the kids.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_02
 I'll put like stripes.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah, yellow.

0:25:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yellow could be, and it doesn't have to be huge.

0:25:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:23	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if you have like a, you have sort of strip kind of.

0:25:27	SPEAKER_01
 But kind of down at the bottom, the base of it's just like yellow with the R.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_03
 So we've simplified.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_03
 We don't need all those play fast forward, rewind.

0:25:42	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:25:43	SPEAKER_03
 No menu buttons.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_03
 So we've pretty much paired it down to on off volume, mute, channel up and down.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_03
 The numbers.

0:25:56	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:26:03	SPEAKER_03
 Can we go back to, I'm going to look really quickly back at those two examples.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_03
 And see if there's anything which one is yours technical functions.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_02
 So yeah, yeah, audio, audio settings and screen settings.

0:26:17	SPEAKER_02
 We need those like audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, screen settings like brightness color.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_02
 Or do we just want that access access from the television itself?

0:26:26	SPEAKER_03
 I think that that's fine just through the TV.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff?

0:26:32	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the other opposite sort of like down at the bottom, like farther away.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_01
 You just have the sort of box in that where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_01
 But occasionally you will use.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, because we need to, we definitely need to have buttons for like subtitles and things like that.

0:26:48	SPEAKER_02
 Because the foreign film market is expanding and stuff. And like on television, like I know living in Los Angeles, it's tons of Spanish network television.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_02
 And if it has English subtitles, it's definitely helpful.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_03
 Can we do that off through one button?

0:27:03	SPEAKER_03
 There's a menu button that pops up with the menu on the TV that says you know audio, video, whatever language, you know?

0:27:10	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:27:11	SPEAKER_02
 So we need up, down inside the side buttons.

0:27:13	SPEAKER_01
 For the menu, you can just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons.

0:27:18	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

0:27:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, channels just up and down.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, yeah.

0:27:23	SPEAKER_03
 And then something that, such as, yeah, the ones, you know, going over there on the left, the engineering center.

0:27:30	SPEAKER_02
 Right, right, right, right.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_02
 That one.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_01
 So we just have like add a menu button then for the various things needed.

0:27:37	SPEAKER_01
 Including the voice recognition.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_01
 If you have any like settings for voice recognition though.

0:27:43	SPEAKER_01
 Including the menu.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I just got an idea for a design.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_02
 Good.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_03
 Anybody have anything else I'd like to bring up in this meeting?

0:28:06	SPEAKER_04
 I had something but I forgot.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:28:10	SPEAKER_03
 You can get out of here.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_03
 Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_03
 All right.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_03
 After this meeting, we're going to be sent a questionnaire and summary again, which we need to reply to that email.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_03
 And then we're going to have lunch break and after lunch, 30 minutes of individual work time.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_03
 I'm going to put the minutes.

0:28:38	SPEAKER_03
 I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the product documents folder.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_03
 If you'd like to review them.

0:28:42	SPEAKER_03
 And I'm going to type up the minutes for this one as well.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_03
 Here's what we're each going to do.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_03
 The ID is going to work on the components concept.

0:28:53	SPEAKER_03
 UID, the user interface concept.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_03
 And you're going to do some trend watching.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_03
 Okay. Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach.

0:29:03	SPEAKER_03
 And if anybody has anything they would like to add?

0:29:06	SPEAKER_03
 No?

0:29:07	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:29:08	SPEAKER_03
 Well, this meeting is officially over.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_03
 Thank you all.
