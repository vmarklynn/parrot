0:00:00	SPEAKER_06
 data man, you know, yeah, I want everything and then I'll decide what I want. So this

0:00:04	SPEAKER_04
 was that face-to-face meeting. Okay. But it doesn't, there isn't, so there are things in the iTRECKREK that we definitely don't want in the GDF format like the frame rate i movement. You know, we're expecting the GDF format to be sort of a parsed version of events and you know, there's just too much raw frame frame rate stuff coming out of this. You wouldn't, you wouldn't want it in this kind of format for translation data. We always get back to it.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_05
 We're not actually throwing anything away. We're not throwing anything away.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_06
 We decide to just dig this at some finer method. We'll still have the original end, a method of filtering. But the way to think of this is this is

0:00:56	SPEAKER_04
 the data that we want to be able to analyze against the other tracks of data. So the data that we want to compare with the language or with whatever. And

0:01:06	SPEAKER_06
 so as long as the format in which we pick it up is a format which could be generalized to a finer take because the worst thing that can ever happen to you is you discover that you've done huge amounts of analysis and you actually had the data but you threw it away because you treated it so grossly. Yeah. Okay.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_06
 So in essence what you would then do is- Whatever we should be able to, you know, backtrack and say okay instead of every second, every tenth of a second or some

0:01:33	SPEAKER_04
 such thing. Well, we're not doing frame rate at any frame for, well, maybe we are. I don't know. Well, the- I had thought we were- Yeah, the eye tracker does.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_04
 Right. Well, the kinds of events that we had before talked about putting into the record for that use in Alana and NXT isn't based on saying every X seconds something, you know, give me what's happening every X seconds. It's more like, you know, give me the fixations and the- What needs to know the duration of these things, right? Yeah, oh, yeah. There's a difference between saying that something that's in a particular state every frame, whatever the frame rate is, you know, ten seconds a minute, you know, that's one kind of way of looking at data and a parsed version of the data which isn't at any particular length. It relies on this really close frame rate. Well, so there's no real time. There's

0:02:30	SPEAKER_06
 only- There's only events. What I'm trying to figure out is whether we throw

0:02:34	SPEAKER_04
 time away. No, no. The time is still in there but you'll get what you want is to figure out what are the concepts behind that data that you want represented. So rather than saying the eye was at this particular place, you know, here and then a tenth of a second later here and then a tenth of a second later here, you say there was a fixation from this time to that time and there was blank from this

0:02:55	SPEAKER_06
 time to that time. Okay, so one of the formats in which our tracker data is analyzed is percentage of time spent on some target as opposed to some competitor over the first second after some event. Okay, so you actually have to have to show at some time slice rate where the eye was on the same target as the other guy, a similar target, what we've both been dealing, you know, so we have to we have all the parts, the interesting parts of the screen identified and be able to show distribution of gaze over time. All right, now we could be really unlucky and somebody would expect us to do that at the real frame rate.

0:03:33	SPEAKER_06
 But I think that's really unlucky but but my point is that we mustn't throw away or lose the capacity of being able to deliver that data.

0:03:42	SPEAKER_04
 So there's two issues here, we're not throwing anything away but the question is what tool would you use to get that information out of the data? Would you be?

0:03:49	SPEAKER_06
 So the more you can plan... So typically the eye will move, right? So over any one second the eye is actually fixing on a bunch of different things and you and so when you say the eye was on this from here to here, what's going to happen is it is that if you use the real frame rate it's going to jiggle all over the place, it's going to be on this landmark, it's on this object, that object, this fixed thing, that fixed thing, okay? You've got to get lots and lots of stuff and it's percentage distribution that you're going to want. It's not... I went here, you know, it's not like person walking, I went here, I stayed here. It's more like fly

0:04:24	SPEAKER_04
 hovering. So you need to know the percentage of time it was on during that

0:04:28	SPEAKER_06
 fixation? Because if you if you take them as separate events you get thousands of

0:04:33	SPEAKER_01
 separate events. Yeah, but they sort of start in any times but give you that and then you just major against, you know, against bigger frames. Yeah, the cumulative

0:04:46	SPEAKER_04
 total timer. Okay, so the percentage is... it's not something you're using for measurement, it's a cutoff for whether or not it counts as a fixation? Well, that's

0:04:54	SPEAKER_06
 the problem. There are two ways of doing it. One is that there's always a cutoff, right? But the other is that there will be a time span, a kind of reaction to

0:05:01	SPEAKER_01
 some event span. Yeah, so I'll lag in some of it to... I suppose there's the

0:05:07	SPEAKER_06
 the saccadic movement itself. And so I mean there are really two ways of looking at this. One would like to know, for example, the percentage of time overall in which two people are looking at the same thing. Okay, and one would like to know sequences of they didn't look at the same thing and then they broke it, or they did look at the same thing and then they did or didn't break, you know, one could imagine those two categories. That's a kind of testing of our hypotheses. But there's a certain amount of dues you pay to the way they do things in the literature to get your papers published. And one of the things they will want to know is an event series after some critical event, right? What percentage of time is given to looking where the other guy is looking? And what percentage of time? Over some, you know, reasonable time span of a couple of seconds. All right, so they'll be... They'll want to see essentially the gays settling on particular incidents on particular places. So we have to be able to deliver those two things and they're rather different demands. Right.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_01
 It should still come out. The little sketch I asked this for last week about NXT and whether it would have that sort of tiered effect. So you can see the overlap of where one person is looking compared to the other and their mouse movements and things. Yeah. That should... Because all you want to know is whether they were looking at the same object in the period after. But because it's also based on the the time course of the procedure, you'll be able to basically get the scan path of the pattern of events from that. Okay. Can we try to make

0:06:35	SPEAKER_04
 sure that that this is satisfying elements of the search? Well, there's a whiteboard, right? We love this thing. See if the pens work. So this is A's eyes, right? And B's eyes. And I think what you're saying, you should probably draw this, right? Is that they... You know, if from this time to this time, they're looking at triangle one. What you're saying is that you want to know in the critical... You want to know after they're looking at triangle one, what's

0:07:13	SPEAKER_06
 happening in this period with the sky, right? Or how... Let's imagine a typical construction event. Okay. There's some part... There are separate movable parts on the screen ready for use, right? There may be or not a construction already begun. Somebody makes the first move. There's some kind of communication, either gestural imaginary or verbal, that plans how we're gonna do it, right? Before that happens, the person who speaks is going to do some kind of visual scanning. While they're speaking or communicating in some way, the other person may or may not be looking where they're looking. Okay. They may be overlapping gaze at particular objects which are of interest. Let's call it the construct, existing construct, which could be zero, right? Or the addendum, the thing which is next going to be added. Next piece. Okay. Now in neither case, when you draw this, he's looking at triangle one, what you're actually drawing, you know, for the period of time in which he's steadily looking at triangle one is going to be very, very short, right? Because staring fixatively without interruption, blink or saccade is an extremely short event. At that point

0:08:36	SPEAKER_01
 they're lumped all the individual fixations as long as it doesn't move off that triangle together is a total of gaze time. So it's in a region.

0:08:47	SPEAKER_06
 It's in a region. That's a target. But even so, you're likely to get bouncing in and out of the region, right? So even so you want to look at if we're interested in how long before the construction move takes place, how much of the time they spend looking at the same thing. Let's call that our measure of alignment. So they're going to be, yeah, that's right, A is going to be on triangle one and various other places. That's right. And B, okay. And we're going to look at the percentage of that time where they're both in the same region. So what I want to make sure is that we don't simplify, do you know what I mean, temporarily

0:09:31	SPEAKER_01
 simplify too much? So that, yeah, I mean as long as we're... Because then you lose

0:09:38	SPEAKER_06
 percentages. There shouldn't be anything to be. Right. And so B has some periods of looking at one and which will also be intermittent. Yeah. Because... So you

0:09:52	SPEAKER_04
 know, he might get triangle one there and now maybe this one's going to overlook quite a bit. So what you want to do is be able to define bigger periods, which is the period when they're sort of interested in triangle one overall, right?

0:10:07	SPEAKER_01
 When they should be. We have an event that, yeah, the second lane then for the second before it and then we can just take that chonk out and

0:10:15	SPEAKER_04
 do something with it. Yeah. But that's... That should be... Okay. That's not something that you can do in the NXT career language but you can't do that in any... You know, this is such a special purpose but it's easy enough, given the data format for any of these things to do that. So you can do it on... Because it's just a matter of... The heart barter is deciding how close together these have to be before you decide this is an event that you want to pull out. Because, you know, algorithmically, you're already putting together. I mean, this is essentially already, you know, these fixations with stuff in between. And, you know, we've got an algorithm for deciding when that's a look, I guess. You already

0:10:54	SPEAKER_01
 have that or no? Well, it's just based on a stable fixation result or something crossing into that region. Oh, yeah, yeah. So it's all

0:11:03	SPEAKER_04
 fixations. These are all fixations and saccades but within the... Yeah. So that's easy enough. So the hard thing is they could be moving their eye arbitrarily here, right? And, you know, maybe even having fixations on other things? Yes.

0:11:17	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah. Because, for example, for part of that time, both B and A are probably looking at the construct. Okay. If your intention is to move the red triangle to sit on top of the thing already constructed, you would tend to look

0:11:31	SPEAKER_04
 back forward. Back forward. Yep. So... This is... This is... Yeah. But what you need to do is... We can already build into this GDF format, these regions, if you can give a definition of what you think that is. But I think the right way to do this is to be able to inspect the data in some tool and play around with the definitions because you won't get it right the first time. Yeah, sure. So the question

0:11:58	SPEAKER_06
 would be under what tool should we be looking at these events? And Elan's a

0:12:04	SPEAKER_04
 reasonable choice for that, right? What you need is something... Well, no, because you need to... You need to be able to see the effects of this. So I guess this is a case of Craig writing some scripts. So Robin having some ideas about what the relationship is and saying, you know, add this data automatically. I mean, it's not that hard, right? It's just there'll be a bunch of these. You'll have some rules about how maybe how long you spend on other objects and whether the other object is the existing construction or not, right? So essentially

0:12:40	SPEAKER_06
 there's this AE is divided into TR1 and C and other stuff, okay, where C is the

0:12:50	SPEAKER_04
 construct of the existing thing. Right. So if they had a fixation on C, you wouldn't be worried. But if they had a fixation on C, well, I mean, we take a

0:12:59	SPEAKER_06
 separate... We'd look at the percentage time. I mean, I have no idea because I don't know how people look when they're building things together, okay?

0:13:05	SPEAKER_06
 So there's the addendum and the existing construct and I don't know whether they're going to spend more time looking at one or the other. But if they're... Whatever it is that one is looking at the other's looking the same

0:13:16	SPEAKER_04
 place, they're in good shape. But, you know, they're gonna look at the clock. Yeah, sure.

0:13:20	SPEAKER_06
 And that's what the other stuff is with the... That's what the diagonal stripes are for. That's true. But we can... One of the things we'll be doing is categorizing people I take it or interactions by the amount of time people spend looking at the clock. We expect that we put people under time pressure.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_06
 They'll look at the clock a lot more. But that's like a separate analysis, right?

0:13:40	SPEAKER_06
 Sure. It's a separate analysis, but you don't want to throw it away.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_06
 No. So... So... You need to find if all of these things are actually categorized by the eye tracker as to where the eye is, right, you should be able to pull out any interesting category and say, all right, for this phase it's TR1 or C. For this phase it's SQ1 or C. But what we find... What we can get out of the data

0:14:07	SPEAKER_04
 easily at the moment is at this kind of level, right? And then it's a case of defining algorithmically all these other transformations that you want. So this is one... We hadn't thought of adding before, but we should, right? Which is...

0:14:20	SPEAKER_04
 Well, how would you decide whether something was the current addendum that you have to

0:14:25	SPEAKER_06
 actually transcribe the thing or watch the film for a while? So that's a human decision.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

0:14:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so once you've got that some information, you've got the GDF format, you then filter it to say, right, between time X and time Y, they're constructing it, they're adding triangle one to the construct, and then you just say, in that time period, what essentially they're looking at triangle one, what essentially they're looking at the construct. So that's unreasonable.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, that's the addendum in the construct should be, you know, kind of...

0:14:53	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah. They change their true identity, but they're categories of stuff.

0:14:59	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, cool.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_06
 My kind of assumption was that this was JP land, that's what he was really interested in, was the kind of coding which would define the building sequence.

0:15:10	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_06
 So, and maybe he wants to think about that more and say, well, there were several candidates for the addendum.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_06
 All right, and it was the negotiation of which candidate was going to be the right candidate.

0:15:24	SPEAKER_06
 That's actually the interesting stuff. So I should talk to him about this.

0:15:27	SPEAKER_06
 He's actually emailed me with a list of things he wants to discuss at length.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_06
 But we believe JP had to be defining that maybe.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_06
 Well, this is my question for him. Is he going to define this kind of building sequence in a way that we can get out or see?

0:15:44	SPEAKER_06
 So, I mean, you know, they've been working on construction there for a while, so maybe that they have a coding system that's ready to go, and we should just apply it.

0:15:53	None
 Yeah.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:15:56	SPEAKER_06
 They do a lot of subassembly.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_06
 The tasks they've been doing, so they may well have a...

0:16:01	SPEAKER_04
 I could believe them, you know, taking an interest in that.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_05
 Well, that's fine.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, the general division was a language here and other stuff there, right?

0:16:11	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:16:12	SPEAKER_05
 I understood it.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_06
 Well, we have the actions might mostly be theirs, right?

0:16:19	SPEAKER_06
 But since we have the eye tracker, we're going to have to answer their questions.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah, eye tracker here. Yeah, we know that.

0:16:27	SPEAKER_06
 But so they'll tell us something about that, but presumably what you piously hope happens here is what happened with transactions, right?

0:16:39	SPEAKER_06
 That the verbal analysis and the visual analysis give you the same breaking points, the same chunking points.

0:16:47	SPEAKER_04
 Well, yeah, but I mean, with transaction coding and something like this, you wouldn't consider it verbal analysis exactly.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_04
 It'd be verbal plus action.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I mean, it's a task breakdown.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_06
 It is a task breakdown, but for the verbal version, there are ways of announcing.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_06
 But now we're doing a new one, right?

0:17:06	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, but you wouldn't have...

0:17:07	SPEAKER_04
 You wouldn't do two codings for task level one.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_04
 No, you wouldn't.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_04
 You would do transaction coding and then...

0:17:12	SPEAKER_06
 One of the things you'd like to establish as an outcome of this is that you could analyze either end and you'd get the same chunking of the material.

0:17:19	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think that's realistic because I think what you'd actually do is use the full record of what you have and do a segmentation.

0:17:27	SPEAKER_04
 I think it'd be hard to understand what was going on if you used just the language without which in the video to decide whether we're breaking down the task.

0:17:34	SPEAKER_06
 It's a hypothesis.

0:17:35	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, you don't want it to be coding based on that, though, and then that seems a strange way to go about things.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_04
 Well...

0:17:42	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, the language events are multi-modal, right?

0:17:44	SPEAKER_04
 They're doing all these things together.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_06
 They are doing these things together, but one of the things that you one could imagine doing is having the transcription there and just play it back to a bunch of captive undergraduates and say...

0:17:58	SPEAKER_06
 Why do you care whether they stop the start?

0:18:00	SPEAKER_04
 Just based on the language.

0:18:02	SPEAKER_06
 Because essentially you're looking at cycling sequences and discourse and if the discourse tells you what's going on, that's information.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, one of the questions is how the information is going to be shared across these media.

0:18:15	SPEAKER_06
 And if you can get it all out of the speech, if all of the chunking is available when there is speech, then it's carrying a lot of the burden.

0:18:27	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it seems to me much less important than the other things one could get out of this data.

0:18:31	SPEAKER_04
 But I...

0:18:32	SPEAKER_04
 But this is...

0:18:33	SPEAKER_04
 It's a possibility.

0:18:34	SPEAKER_06
 We have a look at data like this with our old-fashioned analyses.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_06
 And it would be really nice to know that that much information, that chunking of the task information, is being carried by the language.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_06
 Because JP's question, the overriding question, is so what's language for?

0:18:50	SPEAKER_06
 You know, people are busy interacting all the time, and all of our colleagues don't even bother to control for whether people are talking to one another when they're doing these joint tasks.

0:19:00	SPEAKER_06
 Because it seems to them to be irrelevant, because language is irrelevant.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_06
 It would actually be nice to demonstrate that in a place where we're controlling whether you have language or not, you could get the entire chunking of the task out of the language.

0:19:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, well, I can see maybe wanting to know whether you can do the chunking just based on the actions without the language.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_04
 In cases where they use both.

0:19:16	SPEAKER_04
 It's more... I can't quite see why it's important to know that they can do it just based on the language

0:19:21	SPEAKER_06
 because you know it's a self-contained system as opposed to a system which can't be interpreted without the other system.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_02
 Uh-huh, well, I think that was just bound to fail.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_06
 Almost all studies on language claim that language is a self-contained system, which will give you everything you need to know. Really?

0:19:39	SPEAKER_06
 That's the claim.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:19:41	SPEAKER_05
 All right.

0:19:42	SPEAKER_05
 Anyway.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_06
 I didn't say it was true.

0:19:44	SPEAKER_06
 That's the claim, and so it's worth testing.

0:19:47	SPEAKER_04
 So back to this main problem, which is the record that we are getting in the first instance is about these...

0:19:59	SPEAKER_04
 you know, they're looking at some region of the screen to find dynamically.

0:20:04	SPEAKER_04
 And then we need some way of knowing what the... you can see adding these other analyses about, you know, they're jointly focused on this region and trying to figure out what percentage of time they're looking at it.

0:20:17	SPEAKER_04
 As adding new tiers of information to either the Elan track or NXT, they're both sort of track-based in this way.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_04
 But the hard part is knowing how you want to do that.

0:20:28	SPEAKER_04
 And I think in the first instance, what we're trying to get into the GDF format is just this, and then we've got no option but to figure out a way for, like, to look at this, just explore this data, and suggest ways about doing it, and be able to play them back and see when we think we've got these things right.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_04
 I don't think we even know what the set of these things are that we want much less how to get in there.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_06
 And we will...

0:20:53	SPEAKER_06
 So establishing the full set will, you know, take as much of the project.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's right.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_04
 So this is not... you know, this is something we're aiming for, but this isn't something that affects what Craig programs for the initial GDF translation.

0:21:06	SPEAKER_06
 My only concern, as I said when I barged in, was just to make sure that we didn't lose the things that we might need to pick up later.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. So let's just return to this question of frame rate, because this is the thing we were not planning to transfer into this format.

0:21:22	SPEAKER_04
 So again, you know, a frame-wide kind of coding is, can again be seen as a track, but it says...

0:21:28	SPEAKER_04
 Everything will be...

0:21:29	SPEAKER_04
 It's coding like this, right?

0:21:30	SPEAKER_04
 Where you say it's...

0:21:31	SPEAKER_04
 Well, state A, state B, state C, state A.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, but since the definitions of the thing we're looking at are the ones which get rid of the lower level, like jiggling around in the area of a particular object, right?

0:21:46	SPEAKER_06
 So if we're moving the green triangle, we've defined a region which is dynamically the green triangle wherever it is.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_06
 We will jiggle around in there, but it doesn't matter where we are in there.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_06
 That's the neither level of analysis.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_04
 Right, so I'm just... You're happy that it's not going to have frame rate like this.

0:22:04	SPEAKER_04
 It's going to have an interpretation like this.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_06
 Well, that interpretation is definable to frame rate by the only way we're going to use frame rate.

0:22:13	SPEAKER_06
 What does that mean?

0:22:14	SPEAKER_06
 Sorry.

0:22:15	SPEAKER_06
 Well, I mean, because I can say for how many frames this fixation is officially defined.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_06
 So that as long as it's not an untimed event.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_00
 So it's all events have a start time and the day time.

0:22:29	SPEAKER_06
 So it's fine.

0:22:30	SPEAKER_06
 I can say it's a long one or it's a short one or it's 20 milliseconds more than that one.

0:22:35	SPEAKER_04
 It seems to me that Alan's concerns might mean we need to add more information to these tags because this thing in itself is...

0:22:43	SPEAKER_04
 You need to detect a...

0:22:44	SPEAKER_01
 A bunch of fixations, right?

0:22:45	SPEAKER_01
 With the cards.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_01
 So things like fixation, the number of fixations.

0:22:49	SPEAKER_04
 Fixations and the percentage of time those fixations cover, you might want.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, with some measure of the... so we could work out the number of fixations that made and the average fixation duration as well.

0:23:02	SPEAKER_01
 Because having long steady fixations can be informative.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_05
 And so, okay.

0:23:07	SPEAKER_05
 So, number of fixations as percentage of...

0:23:09	SPEAKER_06
 This isn't the leading question.

0:23:11	SPEAKER_06
 This is a question question.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_06
 Why would that be informative particularly?

0:23:15	SPEAKER_01
 If they're holding their... if there's less dancing around, the cognitive focus tends to be in one sort of part.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_01
 So there is a difference between if they... even though they're still looking the same part, if they're looking around it.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_01
 Rather than just holding their gaze, steady or...

0:23:34	SPEAKER_01
 On it.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_06
 So you think that, for example, if they're looking at one or another apex of triangle, it would just...

0:23:44	SPEAKER_06
 It would make a difference.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_01
 We're exploring the thing.

0:23:47	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, it would certainly...

0:23:48	SPEAKER_01
 As opposed to they were simply...

0:23:49	SPEAKER_06
 All right, there it is.

0:23:50	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_06
 So...

0:23:54	SPEAKER_06
 So that really means that we're not throwing away absolute fixations.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_01
 No, I wouldn't...

0:24:00	SPEAKER_06
 Screen location of absolute fixations.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_01
 But the actual...

0:24:05	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, this is still summary data.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_04
 We're talking about just adding attributes to these things that say the number of fixations that counted as that looking at triangle one.

0:24:17	SPEAKER_04
 Right?

0:24:18	SPEAKER_04
 So it's possible out of it.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_06
 So you... so I thought I understood you to mean exploring the figure because, you know, your fixation is a point.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_06
 And the figures are bigger than points.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_06
 So you could be exploring the figure or you could be just somewhere in the region defined as the figure, but not on...

0:24:35	SPEAKER_01
 Well, yes, but that probably isn't going to be easy to get out of it because they have to break up the part.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_06
 So you just want to know the variability of the fixation.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_06
 And wouldn't that differ from person to person?

0:24:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, it can do, but it's also looking at it within their own behavior.

0:24:57	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, so it's the number of different spots within that region where the eye aspect...

0:25:04	SPEAKER_06
 I would say just the number of fixations.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_01
 The number of different...

0:25:07	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, the spots will be different anyway.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_04
 So it's too great, okay.

0:25:10	SPEAKER_04
 You're not going to have the same pixel.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, exactly.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_04
 So we have the option that we can put in an affixation thing here, right, as well.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_04
 If you want the smaller... if you want the smaller coding in here so that it's not just parsed into this idea of which object, but you also have the raw fixation data.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_04
 We can put that in as another track.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_04
 If you think that that's something that you might want to look at in one of these tools that shows you the tracks against each other.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_06
 Well, all I understood you to ask for was the duration.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's all he asked for.

0:25:40	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:25:41	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I think...

0:25:42	SPEAKER_01
 If we've got everything, then I suppose it's...

0:25:44	SPEAKER_01
 You can come back.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_01
 You can always... yes, it's... you're not throwing anything away then.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, and in NXT there's no cost right because... you just don't choose to load those.

0:25:54	SPEAKER_04
 All we're doing is dumping it as output that you can load if you choose to.

0:25:59	SPEAKER_04
 So if the things that you just know are crazy and you're not going to want, then we don't do it.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_04
 But otherwise we go ahead and dump them because it's easy to dump up the fixations.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:26:11	SPEAKER_06
 Number of different fixations.

0:26:12	SPEAKER_04
 Okay, so it's the number of fixations.

0:26:14	SPEAKER_04
 Well, actually, do you want the average duration?

0:26:16	SPEAKER_06
 Did you want the number of different ones?

0:26:18	SPEAKER_01
 The duration thing as well, somehow, whether it's the average one or...

0:26:22	SPEAKER_06
 Duration of each fixation in the region.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_04
 Not each?

0:26:26	SPEAKER_04
 Well, if it's each, you have to break it down into another tier, right?

0:26:30	SPEAKER_04
 You can say there were three fixations and they averaged at a certain time, but you don't want to...

0:26:35	SPEAKER_01
 The average should be all right to work.

0:26:37	SPEAKER_04
 Well, what about the overall sum of the durations?

0:26:40	SPEAKER_04
 Is that...

0:26:41	SPEAKER_01
 Well, you've already got that number of fixations in the average time...

0:26:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, then that's the way you want it that way around?

0:26:48	None
 Yeah.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_06
 So you had some measure of jiggle in the region, roughly.

0:26:53	SPEAKER_04
 And did you want the percentage of time fixated as opposed to...

0:26:58	SPEAKER_04
 Which is sort of another view of this number?

0:27:01	SPEAKER_04
 You can have as many of these...

0:27:03	SPEAKER_01
 That should be...

0:27:04	SPEAKER_01
 You should be able to derive that presumably from...

0:27:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:27:07	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it's not...

0:27:08	SPEAKER_04
 The extra cost of having these as attributes is not high.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_04
 So, you know, it saves you having to do...

0:27:18	SPEAKER_04
 Write scripts to do arithmetic on that later.

0:27:20	SPEAKER_04
 If you know that these are numbers that are going to be useful to you.

0:27:24	SPEAKER_06
 What's our error of measurement on location on the screen?

0:27:28	SPEAKER_06
 So, to what degree do we actually know whether the two little eyes, little circles, are exactly in the same place, or just somewhere in the same region?

0:27:39	SPEAKER_01
 It can vary a bit depending on the calibration, but we're building in a sort of error margin.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_01
 We based on pixels around, but there will also be a minimum one, because I'm trying to think of probably the small, virtual mouse icon is so small, it'll need a slightly larger...

0:27:58	SPEAKER_01
 It's...

0:27:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_01
 So, a larger error margin around it.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, so my question was going to be...

0:28:06	SPEAKER_06
 The mouse is a dynamic object, right?

0:28:08	SPEAKER_06
 The eye track is a dynamic object, or is it only the piece that the other person's eye track is on?

0:28:15	SPEAKER_06
 That's an object in this definition.

0:28:17	SPEAKER_01
 No, the other person's gaze position is a...

0:28:20	SPEAKER_06
 Is an object.

0:28:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, with some...

0:28:23	SPEAKER_06
 With plus or minus something or other.

0:28:25	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_06
 Around it.

0:28:27	SPEAKER_06
 Some circular area.

0:28:29	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:28:31	SPEAKER_06
 And...

0:28:32	SPEAKER_06
 So, you can be on the object, but not on the other person's gaze.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_06
 So, there can be a triangle, which has...

0:28:43	SPEAKER_06
 So, if there...

0:28:44	SPEAKER_06
 A's gaze in the center, and your gaze actually happens to be here.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_06
 Yes.

0:28:51	SPEAKER_06
 You're in the triangle region.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_06
 Does this...

0:28:53	SPEAKER_01
 But not looking at their individual.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_01
 But they probably will avoid looking directly.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_01
 If they're looking directly at it, it's obscuring the part.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_06
 But it's directly at it when these two...

0:29:08	SPEAKER_06
 In this situation, when these two overlap.

0:29:11	SPEAKER_06
 Right, like this.

0:29:12	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:29:13	SPEAKER_00
 So, I think that's going to cut that.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_00
 Because the...

0:29:16	SPEAKER_00
 Don't worry about this, just in...

0:29:17	SPEAKER_00
 They're only looking at one thing at times, or whether it's a triangle, or whatever else.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_00
 So, what you suggest in there is they can be looking at the triangle and maybe a mouse pointer, and maybe an eye at the same time.

0:29:27	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_06
 Well, it would come up...

0:29:29	SPEAKER_06
 It would say yes.

0:29:30	SPEAKER_06
 Right, I mean, because they would be in the same place.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_06
 So, if you...

0:29:34	SPEAKER_06
 You're going to have dynamic regions which overlap one another by definition.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_06
 If the mouse is on...

0:29:38	SPEAKER_06
 The mouse is on the...

0:29:39	SPEAKER_05
 The construct.

0:29:40	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:29:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:29:43	SPEAKER_04
 Well, well, those are different tracks of information.

0:29:45	SPEAKER_04
 So, what you want is one track of information about which object it's on.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_04
 What about whether or not it's on the other guy's gaze?

0:29:50	SPEAKER_04
 And what about whether it's on one of the mouse's...

0:29:52	SPEAKER_06
 We...

0:29:53	SPEAKER_06
 Treat those as other objects.

0:29:55	SPEAKER_06
 But the difference between them and the parts of the thing to be constructed is that they're allowed to overlap with other things.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_06
 Nothing breaks.

0:30:05	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:30:06	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but in the analysis, you should treat those as completely separate tracks of information.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_04
 Because they can be looking at...

0:30:13	SPEAKER_04
 They could look simultaneously at somebody's mouse, somebody's gaze, and some object.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_04
 Right?

0:30:18	SPEAKER_06
 Yes.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_06
 As opposed to simply looking at somebody's gaze when the mouse isn't also there.

0:30:21	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:30:22	SPEAKER_05
 And you want to know those things.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_06
 So, these are independent.

0:30:24	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:30:25	SPEAKER_04
 They're independent dynamic objects.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_04
 So, what we want is whether they're looking at the other person's gaze, right?

0:30:30	SPEAKER_04
 And say they are in this period.

0:30:33	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I mean...

0:30:34	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:30:35	SPEAKER_06
 So, a definition of we're all looking at it and touching the same thing.

0:30:38	SPEAKER_06
 So, imagine that we've just added a piece to the construct.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_06
 All right?

0:30:43	SPEAKER_06
 So, now that's the construct.

0:30:45	SPEAKER_06
 And both mouse symbols are on it.

0:30:50	SPEAKER_06
 Right?

0:30:51	SPEAKER_06
 And both gazes are on it.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_06
 Yep.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_06
 Right?

0:30:56	SPEAKER_06
 So, at that point, you should have a lineup of A is on the construct, A is on the mouse, A is on...

0:31:03	SPEAKER_06
 A is on A's mouse, A is on B's mouse, A is on B's gaze, and B likewise.

0:31:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:31:10	SPEAKER_04
 So, there's a lot of tracks here, right?

0:31:12	SPEAKER_04
 Because what we just did is this fixation track.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_04
 And there's A's mouse, not their eyes, is on an object, right?

0:31:23	SPEAKER_04
 And the mouse might be on it.

0:31:25	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, but the mouse is also trying a one dynamic object.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_04
 But it doesn't matter.

0:31:30	SPEAKER_04
 That's fine.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:31:32	SPEAKER_04
 The mouse, which thing?

0:31:33	SPEAKER_04
 Where is the mouse?

0:31:34	SPEAKER_04
 You know, it's on this object.

0:31:36	SPEAKER_04
 And then A's eye is on...

0:31:40	SPEAKER_04
 Well, A's mouse, I guess, right?

0:31:42	SPEAKER_04
 A's eye might be looking at A's mouse here.

0:31:47	SPEAKER_04
 Right?

0:31:48	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, these are all the different ways of taking cross products, the things that could be collocated.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_04
 So, you just treat them as independent.

0:31:55	SPEAKER_04
 And I guess it from what you say...

0:31:56	SPEAKER_04
 And then you look for combinations of them.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_04
 I'm guessing from what you're saying, you want all these tracks.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_04
 I think we need to.

0:32:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_04
 Which is a measurable line.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_04
 And it's looking where the other guy is directing attention.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_04
 And there are two measures of where the other guy is directing attention.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_06
 That you get from the visual track.

0:32:08	SPEAKER_06
 One is where the mouse is.

0:32:09	SPEAKER_06
 The other is where the gaze is.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_06
 So...

0:32:12	SPEAKER_06
 So, you know, I think that's a good idea.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:19	SPEAKER_04
 So, yeah.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_00
 So, yeah.

0:32:21	SPEAKER_00
 So, it's just a matter of adding the two mice pointless and the two gazes as extra objects.

0:32:27	SPEAKER_00
 So, yeah.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_00
 As long as I've got an ID in there, we can just say, right, at this...

0:32:31	SPEAKER_00
 Between these times, they're looking at that object or the look at the mouse, the look at whatever.

0:32:35	SPEAKER_04
 But the important thing is you don't treat that entire set as mutually exclusive and exhaustive.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_04
 It's just...

0:32:40	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:32:41	SPEAKER_04
 The...

0:32:42	SPEAKER_04
 The objects is like a separate level of analysis.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_04
 It's just one of the looking at the objects, then one of the looking at the gaze.

0:32:49	SPEAKER_06
 But it's also going to be the case that whatever region you define as the region of the dynamic object of the red triangle may get to the point where it overlaps the region of the dynamic object of the green square.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_06
 What do we do about that?

0:33:03	SPEAKER_06
 Does that happen?

0:33:04	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_06
 Because if you have them close together, there's always some fuzz factor around there.

0:33:08	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, right.

0:33:09	SPEAKER_06
 And so, if they're left lying close together, or in fact in the model, in the...

0:33:14	SPEAKER_06
 Not in the model, in the supplies set, they're actually neatly packed into a little space.

0:33:20	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_04
 So, what you're saying is like a new problem for us, which is...

0:33:23	SPEAKER_04
 I'm going to change...

0:33:24	SPEAKER_01
 Two objects close together.

0:33:25	SPEAKER_01
 Your eye gaze can actually be looking at the left edge of one and the right edge of the other.

0:33:32	SPEAKER_01
 And they're therefore looking at two objects at once.

0:33:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_04
 So, you're saying...

0:33:36	SPEAKER_04
 Speak, speak, okay.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_04
 Can you write on my pen pad?

0:33:41	SPEAKER_04
 Just say...

0:33:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, pens.

0:33:43	SPEAKER_04
 Pen.

0:33:44	SPEAKER_04
 Whiteboard pens.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_04
 So, you're saying, you know, they could be looking at square one at this point.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_04
 Because they...

0:33:54	SPEAKER_06
 Because the two are so close together that their regions overlap.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_04
 That's a problem for the data models and either the things that we're using.

0:34:03	SPEAKER_01
 That's a problem.

0:34:06	SPEAKER_01
 Unless we just define it as...

0:34:09	SPEAKER_01
 There's only... they are exclusive.

0:34:11	SPEAKER_01
 And whichever area has the greatest overlap is what they're actually looking at.

0:34:16	SPEAKER_01
 What do you mean by greatest?

0:34:17	SPEAKER_01
 Well, if you've got your sort of eye position and it's unlikely to be exactly 50% in one object and 50% in the other.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_04
 Draw it.

0:34:27	SPEAKER_04
 My special reasoning is no good.

0:34:30	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's really important.

0:34:32	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's really information.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_04
 I'm the one that uses the whiteboard because I actually put the marker on.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:34:38	SPEAKER_01
 Well, I'm thinking is if you've got, say, one object there and...

0:34:43	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, so this is...

0:34:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, this is the better pen.

0:34:46	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:34:53	SPEAKER_01
 Part one and part two.

0:34:56	SPEAKER_01
 And you've got their sort of... they're looking...

0:35:00	SPEAKER_02
 They're...

0:35:02	SPEAKER_01
 Then that overlap means they're looking at two pieces simultaneously.

0:35:09	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:35:10	SPEAKER_04
 But you had a way of choosing which one, right?

0:35:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but maybe a bad idea.

0:35:13	SPEAKER_04
 This is more of it.

0:35:14	SPEAKER_04
 It may be a bad idea.

0:35:15	SPEAKER_06
 You've just thrown data away.

0:35:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's a decision.

0:35:19	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the thing is that...

0:35:21	SPEAKER_01
 I'm saying is if they're looking... if most of what their overlap is here, then we stick with that one.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_04
 So, what do you mean, which... is it closer to the... is the circle...

0:35:33	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, what is the circle?

0:35:34	SPEAKER_04
 They're looking at a pixel or something, right?

0:35:37	SPEAKER_01
 No, that... because the gaze position will be a sort of fuzzy area.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_01
 It won't just be a pixel.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_01
 It will be a natural... like a circle.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_01
 Why is it wobble?

0:35:48	SPEAKER_01
 The gaze will wobble.

0:35:49	SPEAKER_01
 So that's... that's going to be...

0:35:52	SPEAKER_01
 So that's very... it's a sort of lump target.

0:35:57	SPEAKER_01
 So there'll be a bit of a... some sort of overlap.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_01
 Two objects.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_06
 Or indeed, they might be looking from one to another.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, they're deciding which one to choose or thinking.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_06
 So you don't want to decide it's only one.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_00
 The only GDS force is working at the moment.

0:36:13	SPEAKER_00
 It's actually got a separate track for each part.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well, that's fine.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_06
 I was going to say that's the obvious.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, but what?

0:36:19	SPEAKER_04
 And that's going to be analytically.

0:36:20	SPEAKER_04
 Because it's going to...

0:36:22	SPEAKER_04
 Well...

0:36:23	SPEAKER_04
 Which one is yes or no?

0:36:24	SPEAKER_04
 How many parts of it?

0:36:25	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it depends on what you're building.

0:36:28	SPEAKER_00
 There's different parts.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_00
 There's different parts, whether you're doing the 10 gram, whether you're doing an airplane or whatever.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_00
 Six, two, a dozen.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:36:36	SPEAKER_06
 I know ways of getting around the center.

0:36:38	SPEAKER_00
 We can easily analyze it down later on.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, I think it's very likely that...

0:36:44	SPEAKER_06
 If the other ones are oscillating,

0:36:46	SPEAKER_01
 then that's presumably going to change the width. So you're actually going to see them flipping between...

0:36:53	SPEAKER_01
 Well, not if the regions overlap.

0:36:55	SPEAKER_01
 If they're really close to the region,

0:36:56	SPEAKER_04
 it's going to get boxed. It's really close.

0:36:58	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_06
 And if you define the regions so neatly that there's...

0:37:05	SPEAKER_06
 You know, that we're losing gaze because of jiggle outside this closely defined region when it's in the middle of space, then...

0:37:12	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, I actually like the solution.

0:37:15	SPEAKER_06
 However, ugly, it looks in terms of the data format of having a track for every...

0:37:18	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, well, the last format I'm worried about,

0:37:20	SPEAKER_04
 it's the way you do the analysis because you don't want to have to say... You know, did they jointly look at triangle one?

0:37:28	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:37:29	SPEAKER_04
 Did they jointly look at square one?

0:37:30	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_04
 Did they jointly look at...

0:37:32	SPEAKER_04
 You know, you need some way of...

0:37:33	SPEAKER_04
 It's a thing.

0:37:34	SPEAKER_04
 Going over the whole thing.

0:37:36	SPEAKER_04
 But we can find ways around that.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_04
 I think for now we do it this way and then we think about what we need out of it in the end.

0:37:42	SPEAKER_04
 It's just, you know, in a lawn that has the side effect, that if you go for the naturalistic way of up translating to a lawn, there'll be a zillion tracks and it'll probably ruin their viewer because you'll get very sparse data on each track.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_04
 It'll be like the old referring expression general visualization in the map task, you know, when they talk about one object, one landmark, and then another one.

0:38:04	SPEAKER_04
 That was brilliant.

0:38:05	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it's big, right?

0:38:07	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, it is big and you do have to scroll through it to see what's going on, but it gives you a very clear picture of what's going on.

0:38:12	SPEAKER_06
 Well, we'll see if a lawn likes it or not.

0:38:14	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_06
 Well, okay.

0:38:16	SPEAKER_06
 So we better do a test one.

0:38:17	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_04
 And we better also like have in the representational list of part, like even in the NXT of translational list of parts.

0:38:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:38:25	SPEAKER_00
 It affects the way we do the NXT.

0:38:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:38:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:38:28	SPEAKER_00
 But there's only list of parts in the GDF.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_00
 So, yeah, that's not a problem.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_00
 There's a base basically what we've got is, well, there's three places where you've got the ID there.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_00
 So you've got an ID for a part, you've got an ID for a location on the screen.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_00
 So that's just the target config, the clock, whatever else.

0:38:41	SPEAKER_00
 And then we can easily add IDs for the two mouse points and the two gazes.

0:38:45	SPEAKER_00
 And from that, basically all the tracks that are doing is saying, between this time there's a look at this object, yeah, this ID.

0:38:53	SPEAKER_00
 So, so it's effectively a track for each ID.

0:38:57	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:38:58	SPEAKER_06
 So what about the point where a part becomes the construct?

0:39:02	SPEAKER_06
 You still are unified as a part.

0:39:04	SPEAKER_00
 But not much should lose that.

0:39:06	SPEAKER_00
 Well, what happens there is that the two, the existing parts basically cease to exist.

0:39:12	SPEAKER_00
 And a new part with a new ID starts existing at the point where they're joining.

0:39:16	SPEAKER_06
 So every time a part is added to the construct, it becomes a new part.

0:39:20	SPEAKER_06
 So the construct actually has, say, it has six things that are added to some initial thing.

0:39:28	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:39:29	SPEAKER_06
 So if there's just the initial thing you've put in the middle of the screen, that's just the initial object.

0:39:34	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:39:35	SPEAKER_06
 As soon as you put a part, there's a construct.

0:39:36	SPEAKER_06
 But it's construct one because when you add another part, construct one ceases to exist.

0:39:40	SPEAKER_06
 And you get construct two.

0:39:42	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:39:43	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:39:44	SPEAKER_06
 So actually defining all of those as the construct is going to be the trickiest thing.

0:39:49	SPEAKER_01
 It's also going to be a problem because you're going to have one part to construct forming in the middle of a fixation.

0:40:00	None
 Right.

0:40:01	SPEAKER_01
 So it's not going to be quite as clear.

0:40:04	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:40:05	SPEAKER_01
 So you're looking at triangle one, right?

0:40:07	SPEAKER_01
 All of a sudden it's something else.

0:40:10	SPEAKER_01
 And it becomes construct or assembly, whatever.

0:40:13	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:40:14	SPEAKER_04
 And there could be more than one construct at a time, right?

0:40:17	SPEAKER_04
 There is no construct.

0:40:19	SPEAKER_04
 And then you can start again.

0:40:21	SPEAKER_04
 Also when you build some sort of assembly, then you can screw that and link the.

0:40:24	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:40:25	SPEAKER_04
 But why does it, why does construct one become construct two when you add something to it?

0:40:28	SPEAKER_04
 Because the.

0:40:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's always working the moment because it's generating a new idea when you create a new part.

0:40:35	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, and this is because we don't want it to stay triangle one.

0:40:37	SPEAKER_04
 When you start with a construct, it's not a construct at all.

0:40:39	SPEAKER_04
 It's just a one thing.

0:40:40	SPEAKER_04
 And we don't want to triangle one to suddenly have.

0:40:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:40:43	SPEAKER_06
 Well, the problem is that all of these things are popping out of existence.

0:40:46	SPEAKER_06
 So do we know the difference between we broke it and it went away?

0:40:51	SPEAKER_06
 And it's now part of the construct.

0:40:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but there's join events.

0:40:56	SPEAKER_00
 So if a join event, if there's a join event linked to linked to item, then you know, it's become part of a construct.

0:41:01	SPEAKER_06
 Or can we tag the constructs with what's in them?

0:41:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, the contracts are already tagged with it.

0:41:09	SPEAKER_00
 So there's actually a separate part of the data format which says for each construct, which two parts made that.

0:41:15	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:41:16	SPEAKER_06
 So we could essentially, well, then we could cumulative or it is a new construct because it has a new listed, a new cumulative listed parts.

0:41:24	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:41:25	SPEAKER_00
 But you can still track what parts went into it.

0:41:27	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:41:28	SPEAKER_06
 So you can still find triangle one, whatever.

0:41:30	SPEAKER_06
 Some fancy programming is going to have to be done to say, I was looking at triangle one and I'm looking at triangle one in construct one.

0:41:38	SPEAKER_06
 Because the first construct was triangle one and square one.

0:41:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:41:42	SPEAKER_00
 But that's easy to me because the, the, the, each construct has the IDs for the, the things that construct it.

0:41:48	SPEAKER_06
 So now we have to ask whether.

0:41:54	SPEAKER_06
 So let's imagine this.

0:41:55	SPEAKER_06
 We've made a construct of two parts and we're a triangle and a square and we're considering now adding something on to the side of the square that isn't attached to the triangle.

0:42:05	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:42:07	SPEAKER_06
 Are we looking at the square?

0:42:09	SPEAKER_06
 Are we looking at the construct?

0:42:11	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:42:12	SPEAKER_04
 That was the next question I had.

0:42:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:42:15	SPEAKER_01
 You're really looking at the construct.

0:42:17	SPEAKER_01
 Because I said in this definition, I should be looking at the construct.

0:42:19	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:42:20	SPEAKER_06
 The reason to figure out that you're looking at the square rather than the triangle.

0:42:25	SPEAKER_00
 Well, yeah.

0:42:26	SPEAKER_00
 The thing is that we used to have the x, the x, y traces from the ASCII format.

0:42:30	SPEAKER_00
 So if you want, if you want to be able to save on looking at the square instead of on the construct.

0:42:34	SPEAKER_00
 So it is possible to get that data out.

0:42:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:42:38	SPEAKER_00
 It's not doing it.

0:42:39	SPEAKER_00
 It's not doing it in the jazz sandwich at the moment, but I can easily add it to give that information if you want.

0:42:43	SPEAKER_06
 Because I mean, that's the example presumably that's the best example of overlapping areas.

0:42:50	SPEAKER_06
 Because if the two things are now about it, of course, there's an area which is coming into both of them.

0:42:56	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:42:57	SPEAKER_06
 So what I'm trying to run through in my head is that we can always tell the difference between something going out of existence.

0:43:06	SPEAKER_06
 Because it's trying to construct something going out of existence because we threw it away.

0:43:10	SPEAKER_06
 Right. Suppose we pick up and we screwed up the first time we put the triangle with the square and we threw it away.

0:43:18	SPEAKER_06
 We decided we didn't like it.

0:43:20	SPEAKER_06
 And we took another one.

0:43:22	SPEAKER_06
 Is it triangle one? Is it triangle one prime or something like that?

0:43:26	SPEAKER_06
 It's the replacement triangle.

0:43:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:43:28	SPEAKER_00
 If you create a new part, it gets a new ID.

0:43:30	SPEAKER_00
 So if you get your dragon new part, how do I know what it replaces?

0:43:34	SPEAKER_04
 You don't because that's, you'd have to have human coding to do that.

0:43:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:43:40	SPEAKER_04
 You want to know which one they're planning on using.

0:43:42	SPEAKER_06
 This is true. But if I have triangles one, two, three, right, and I throw them away.

0:43:47	SPEAKER_06
 Any triangles I take out are to replace one, two, three.

0:43:51	SPEAKER_04
 Well, you know which mold they come from.

0:43:53	SPEAKER_04
 And so you know which shape they match, but you can't possibly know which one of the ones they're meant to replace.

0:43:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:43:59	SPEAKER_06
 You don't know which one they're meant to replace, but you know they're not meant to replace any better all better.

0:44:04	SPEAKER_06
 They haven't been thrown away.

0:44:05	SPEAKER_01
 They can't replace the new parts when they appear when the previous one's broken.

0:44:13	SPEAKER_06
 Right. So the new parts are replacing those which have disappeared from the screen.

0:44:18	SPEAKER_06
 Yes.

0:44:19	SPEAKER_06
 And if there's no more TR1 track, the TR1 track is gone.

0:44:22	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, so there's no two parts with the same shape?

0:44:24	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, there are many.

0:44:25	SPEAKER_01
 Same shape, but not the same shape and color.

0:44:27	SPEAKER_05
 Same identity.

0:44:28	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, same shape and color.

0:44:29	SPEAKER_05
 Right. Okay.

0:44:30	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, is that true?

0:44:31	SPEAKER_01
 You've decided not to make all the triangles written, squares written.

0:44:32	SPEAKER_01
 That's what they're at the moment.

0:44:34	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. So you can't tell what is meant to replace that because it's the same.

0:44:37	SPEAKER_01
 It's just the case of the mold, right?

0:44:39	SPEAKER_01
 Yes. That's the way it works at the moment.

0:44:41	SPEAKER_01
 I assume that's how nine Negan had set up a lot.

0:44:46	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. So that's back to Tim's.

0:44:50	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:44:51	SPEAKER_06
 So shape plus color.

0:44:54	SPEAKER_01
 They are individual.

0:44:56	SPEAKER_01
 They're unique.

0:44:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yep.

0:44:58	SPEAKER_06
 All the parts are unique.

0:45:00	SPEAKER_06
 So we hang on, that makes the task a little bit easier.

0:45:04	SPEAKER_01
 Yes. Right.

0:45:05	SPEAKER_01
 Tim, 10 grams are much easier and you can see all the lines.

0:45:11	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:45:12	SPEAKER_01
 So it is just a construction task rather than a puzzle.

0:45:16	SPEAKER_06
 Indeed.

0:45:17	SPEAKER_06
 Which kind of leaves you with an obvious way of making the same task harder and easier, doesn't it?

0:45:22	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:45:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:45:24	SPEAKER_06
 But this also, that's hard to code.

0:45:25	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, that's really a thing we might do.

0:45:27	SPEAKER_06
 Okay. So now let's make sure that the coding would survive that.

0:45:31	SPEAKER_06
 It's just, it's a beautifully controlled situation.

0:45:33	SPEAKER_06
 The construction task is essentially the same.

0:45:35	SPEAKER_06
 It's the figuring out stuff that gets harder if everything is purple.

0:45:40	SPEAKER_06
 For just to choose a color at random here.

0:45:43	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:45:44	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. So I think the ending is probably a little bit, then two triangles, isn't there?

0:45:47	SPEAKER_00
 There's two identical triangles in the tangram.

0:45:49	SPEAKER_01
 Yes. At the moment, there are two, I think, two small ones and two large triangles.

0:45:54	SPEAKER_01
 They're actually the same physical size and shape.

0:45:57	SPEAKER_01
 At the moment, they're in different colors.

0:45:59	SPEAKER_01
 That also means in the new parts list, they're therefore, you know, two large triangles and two small ones.

0:46:07	SPEAKER_01
 Small ones.

0:46:08	SPEAKER_01
 Whereas in the revised edition, if they were all just plaque, they'd only be one, uh, mold in the new parts.

0:46:15	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:46:16	SPEAKER_04
 Well, in, when you specify these things, do you specify the molds or does it figure out what the molds are based on?

0:46:20	SPEAKER_04
 So is this hard word into Tim's program or is it just an artifact?

0:46:23	SPEAKER_04
 An artifact is the way we-

0:46:24	SPEAKER_01
 It's hard word. It just-

0:46:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah. Yeah. When you specify the molds in the- in the- in the- the file that generates the parts, we've got a list of parts.

0:46:31	SPEAKER_00
 The molds are based just taken out of the- the file that generates the- the first place apart.

0:46:35	SPEAKER_00
 Right. Okay.

0:46:36	SPEAKER_00
 So- So how many parts- How many parts are in the file?

0:46:39	SPEAKER_00
 That's how many parts appear in the- in the parts box.

0:46:42	SPEAKER_06
 So if you have five black triangles, they're going to be five black triangles in the parts box or one.

0:46:46	SPEAKER_00
 If you have five black triangles, there's going to be five- five parts in the part- five black triangles in the parts box.

0:46:51	SPEAKER_00
 But- So minor- But what you can do, in the initial configuration, you can reuse a triangle.

0:46:57	SPEAKER_00
 So if you only want one black triangle, you just create one black triangle in the parts box and then reuse that black triangle five times in the configuration.

0:47:05	SPEAKER_06
 Mm-hmm. Okay.

0:47:07	SPEAKER_06
 As long as this is possible. So I mean, that just is a kind of thing which is so simple.

0:47:12	SPEAKER_06
 So much like a single.

0:47:14	SPEAKER_06
 Yep.

0:47:15	SPEAKER_06
 Seem.

0:47:17	SPEAKER_06
 One zero variable change that it did.

0:47:19	SPEAKER_06
 But what would- Doesn't matter, because I'm trying to kind of map this onto biofix.

0:47:23	SPEAKER_06
 And biofix has multiple, you know, all the- The nuts are red or all the flat things or-

0:47:36	SPEAKER_01
 No, they can't have different nuts there. Well, it's not very different-

0:47:42	SPEAKER_06
 The same part is different colors.

0:47:44	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah. Yeah, but they don't have enough to make unique.

0:47:47	SPEAKER_01
 No, I mean, there's more than- There are multiple pieces of the same.

0:47:51	SPEAKER_01
 Mm-hmm.

0:47:53	SPEAKER_06
 So when you say a red nut or a green bolt or a long green bolt, then there'll be lots of them lying around.

0:48:01	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:48:02	SPEAKER_06
 I think that's how the robot is set up too.

0:48:04	SPEAKER_06
 Mm-hmm.

0:48:05	SPEAKER_06
 So five green bolts.

0:48:06	SPEAKER_06
 Here is one.

0:48:07	SPEAKER_04
 I think we've gotten to the point where, you know, to try to summarize, we think Tim's program can do both of these conditions.

0:48:16	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:48:17	SPEAKER_04
 But I'm still worried about what the effects are for analysis, because you were aiming at something in the GDF format, and I wasn't quite sure what.

0:48:27	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:48:28	SPEAKER_06
 So all I'm doing is kind of worrying out loud about all the things that will happen that will miss by a simple view of, for example, regions and looking at triangle one.

0:48:38	SPEAKER_06
 Yes.

0:48:39	SPEAKER_04
 When it's triangle one, not triangle one anymore.

0:48:41	SPEAKER_04
 So, okay, so I'll summarize what we said about that part, that every time you cast up a new part from a mold or, you know, every black triangle has a different idea.

0:48:50	SPEAKER_04
 And you know it's a black triangle, because you know which mold it came from.

0:48:54	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:48:55	SPEAKER_04
 But you don't know which part it was intended to replace on the screen, because you can't mind read.

0:48:59	SPEAKER_06
 That's true.

0:49:02	SPEAKER_06
 So how can we define the shapes that people build?

0:49:07	SPEAKER_04
 What do you mean define?

0:49:09	SPEAKER_06
 If, assuming I was, for a moment I was JP and I wanted to know how they actually went about building the thing.

0:49:19	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:49:21	SPEAKER_06
 And I wanted to look at the strategy.

0:49:25	SPEAKER_06
 And I wanted to see if the strategy was different when we could talk about it, and when we just picked up whatever.

0:49:31	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, suppose I can't talk to you and I'm doing this task with you and I can't talk to you.

0:49:35	SPEAKER_06
 The thing which is going to be hardest for me is making elaborate plans with you.

0:49:41	SPEAKER_06
 I can reach for the next thing and you can go where I reach.

0:49:44	SPEAKER_06
 But if I have some sub goal, some long term sub goal of doing something clever with putting these together because it's hard and putting these together because it's hard.

0:49:52	SPEAKER_06
 It's going to be almost impossible to convey that to you.

0:49:55	SPEAKER_06
 And the difference in the history of construction is an important thing.

0:50:02	SPEAKER_06
 And I wonder how we can get that information back.

0:50:04	SPEAKER_04
 I think that this is a human coding that is part of the action in coding because I don't see how anybody but a person watching this can guess why they cast off this thing at this time.

0:50:15	SPEAKER_06
 Why is not, that's not the question I'm asking. The question I'm asking is what's the history of the construct.

0:50:22	SPEAKER_06
 So you have the names of the things in there.

0:50:24	SPEAKER_06
 And you have two constructs.

0:50:25	SPEAKER_06
 Suppose we have two sub constructs.

0:50:28	SPEAKER_06
 And whichever one had two pieces put together first is the earlier number of those constructs.

0:50:33	SPEAKER_06
 How do you tell the difference between adding a piece to this first construct and creating a second construct?

0:50:42	SPEAKER_00
 When the file construct, the way the constructs are defined in the file, you've got your parent construct and the parts that it was constructed out of.

0:50:50	SPEAKER_00
 And the other thing is it's a parent-child relationship.

0:50:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, so you've got a parent-child relationship and the child can be a part or it can be another construct.

0:50:58	SPEAKER_06
 So construct two, construct one is a red triangle and green square.

0:51:05	SPEAKER_06
 Construct two is two green squares.

0:51:10	SPEAKER_06
 Construct three is a red triangle, a green square and another red triangle.

0:51:17	SPEAKER_06
 Construct four.

0:51:18	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but that's okay because they all have different underlying part numbers.

0:51:21	SPEAKER_04
 And when you say what a construct is.

0:51:23	SPEAKER_06
 So how are we going to tell when, for example, you think we're going to have to do human coding on when two sub constructs are put together?

0:51:31	SPEAKER_05
 No, no, no, no.

0:51:32	SPEAKER_06
 No, that's definition where a construct has construct as children.

0:51:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, because there's a joint action.

0:51:37	SPEAKER_00
 The result, what you need to do is to do a construct in the part, two parts, whatever you think together.

0:51:42	SPEAKER_00
 And then the result there is a construct.

0:51:44	SPEAKER_00
 You've got time when that happens.

0:51:45	SPEAKER_00
 You can see that construct appeared at that time.

0:51:48	SPEAKER_00
 And you can still track the children of that construct.

0:51:50	SPEAKER_06
 We can zip through this and look at all the interactions in which people built construct construct, construct first, which we expect them to do as a wild hypothesis more when they have verbal communication than when they don't.

0:52:04	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, and we can do that by simply searching for any constructs that have construct as children.

0:52:10	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:52:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, so we can easily look at things like that automatically.

0:52:14	SPEAKER_04
 It's just the why they get new parts that's the problem for us. We can't, if they suddenly, if they decide to get a part of a mold, we don't know. We can't know why until they do something with it.

0:52:25	SPEAKER_06
 We haven't actually made a rule that you can't collect extra parts, right?

0:52:29	SPEAKER_01
 Extra parts don't appear, so you can't click.

0:52:32	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, yeah, you said that.

0:52:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, there are a couple of minutes like grayed out there.

0:52:36	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but you can see the mold is there, but they don't come filled.

0:52:40	SPEAKER_05
 No, no, I mean, you have to break one to get one.

0:52:42	SPEAKER_04
 Yes.

0:52:43	SPEAKER_04
 You can, but you can break one. When you break one, you don't cast off the mold yourself. It happens automatically. Yes.

0:52:49	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. Never mind that.

0:52:50	SPEAKER_01
 It appears.

0:52:51	SPEAKER_01
 And then you like it.

0:52:52	SPEAKER_01
 So they just have to use it. Yeah.

0:52:54	SPEAKER_01
 The new part lights up sort of thing.

0:52:56	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, but they have to drag it up past the mold line.

0:53:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, you have to bring it into play.

0:53:02	SPEAKER_06
 And you can't just bring extras in case you screw up.

0:53:06	SPEAKER_01
 You have to screw up first and then you bring it.

0:53:08	SPEAKER_01
 That is one thing unlike the, say the bow fix or anything.

0:53:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, with this extra part.

0:53:13	SPEAKER_01
 There aren't any extra parts.

0:53:14	SPEAKER_01
 And at the moment, the software doesn't.

0:53:16	SPEAKER_01
 But it does have replacement.

0:53:18	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:53:19	SPEAKER_01
 Replacement, but no superfluous.

0:53:22	SPEAKER_01
 So you can't have a standard stock of extra parts that will never use.

0:53:26	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. So this is why question doesn't even arise.

0:53:28	SPEAKER_06
 So you appreciate, you appreciate the cost.

0:53:30	SPEAKER_04
 Because you know what they're going to do with it.

0:53:32	SPEAKER_04
 When they decide to move it past the mold line, they're doing something with it probably.

0:53:36	SPEAKER_04
 And you'll know what they're going to do with it because.

0:53:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but by the time both of them are doing that, they must have already broken something.

0:53:43	SPEAKER_00
 So you don't love what they were facing.

0:53:45	SPEAKER_06
 So they rejected something.

0:53:47	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:53:48	SPEAKER_06
 Is there a way of telling the difference between intentional and intentional breakages?

0:53:58	SPEAKER_06
 How would you do that?

0:54:00	SPEAKER_04
 Intentional.

0:54:01	SPEAKER_01
 In the sense that they break deliberately when they bring them into the new parts.

0:54:07	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, it's like the trash can idea.

0:54:09	SPEAKER_06
 They both put their hands on a construct because they don't like it.

0:54:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but there'd be no way of coding that automatically.

0:54:16	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:54:17	SPEAKER_04
 How could you possibly do that?

0:54:19	SPEAKER_01
 You have to hope that there's language in one of them say something.

0:54:22	SPEAKER_01
 But that's a human coding.

0:54:23	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:54:24	SPEAKER_01
 So there's no way you could tell that just from the role movement.

0:54:30	SPEAKER_01
 So not generically.

0:54:32	SPEAKER_06
 Because if they're going to do it by gesture, they'll build up a convention.

0:54:37	SPEAKER_04
 So that's going to be a problem for JP.

0:54:42	SPEAKER_04
 Remember all the things we're looking at are with language and without language.

0:54:46	SPEAKER_04
 And it's going to be very difficult to tell whether they broke something intentionally without the language.

0:54:50	SPEAKER_04
 Which means it's probably not.

0:54:51	SPEAKER_06
 They develop a convention.

0:54:52	SPEAKER_06
 Suppose they start off with language and then they say.

0:54:55	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:54:56	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:54:57	SPEAKER_04
 This is probably part of the action coding.

0:54:59	SPEAKER_04
 Sure.

0:55:00	SPEAKER_04
 I just want to make sure that they're not.

0:55:02	SPEAKER_04
 Wishlist.

0:55:03	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:55:04	SPEAKER_01
 Wishlist.

0:55:05	SPEAKER_01
 As a side effect.

0:55:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:55:07	SPEAKER_01
 I'm trying to remember if the people deliberately break things by moving two pieces together.

0:55:11	SPEAKER_01
 They don't break.

0:55:14	SPEAKER_00
 They do.

0:55:15	SPEAKER_00
 If one person is dragging a part to a part that isn't that the part that's just sitting on the screen does not be in touch.

0:55:22	SPEAKER_00
 They both break.

0:55:23	SPEAKER_01
 So the intentional thing is when they actually both click on the same object.

0:55:30	SPEAKER_06
 For sure you know that's.

0:55:32	SPEAKER_06
 Well, it's not necessarily intentional.

0:55:34	SPEAKER_04
 They could just screw up.

0:55:35	SPEAKER_04
 They could discuss to send it a break something.

0:55:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:55:39	SPEAKER_04
 I don't know what's very good.

0:55:41	SPEAKER_06
 No, we'll never get away with that.

0:55:42	SPEAKER_06
 We'll get a bad score.

0:55:43	SPEAKER_06
 Let's just throw that away and start again.

0:55:45	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:55:46	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:55:47	SPEAKER_06
 Wish reminds me we have fixed the score problem.

0:55:52	SPEAKER_06
 Have we?

0:55:53	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:55:54	None
 Yeah.

0:55:55	SPEAKER_00
 It was through the rotation.

0:55:57	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yes.

0:55:58	SPEAKER_01
 The percentage score.

0:55:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:56:00	SPEAKER_01
 So rather than the number of penalties or something like no, the score.

0:56:03	SPEAKER_01
 It was the percentage overlap.

0:56:05	SPEAKER_06
 And that made the score.

0:56:07	SPEAKER_06
 That's that's the way it's worked out.

0:56:10	SPEAKER_01
 But the problem was to do with the.

0:56:13	SPEAKER_01
 Which they had relative and absolute piece and.

0:56:17	SPEAKER_01
 It's all to symmetry.

0:56:19	SPEAKER_01
 But it wasn't a bug.

0:56:22	SPEAKER_01
 It was a.

0:56:23	SPEAKER_01
 Don't tell me it was a feature.

0:56:25	SPEAKER_06
 No, it was them just forgetting to.

0:56:28	SPEAKER_04
 To find something that had to be.

0:56:30	SPEAKER_01
 And the.

0:56:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:56:32	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:56:33	SPEAKER_01
 Which is probably a documentation fault.

0:56:36	SPEAKER_04
 It's in the documentation, but it's like.

0:56:40	SPEAKER_00
 It's like.

0:56:41	SPEAKER_00
 It's quite.

0:56:42	SPEAKER_06
 It's like.

0:56:55	SPEAKER_04
 Well, one past things or anything else you want to tell us about the prior part of this, which is the.

0:56:59	SPEAKER_04
 You know, what else is holding you up from.

0:57:02	SPEAKER_01
 Well, yes, we should go back to the beginning.

0:57:04	SPEAKER_01
 The Camtasia was tested last week and initially we were a bit worried because.

0:57:12	SPEAKER_01
 In the old version, it seemed to interfere with it.

0:57:15	SPEAKER_01
 But when you when Craig recompiled it and it is new version, it's like.

0:57:19	SPEAKER_01
 Seems to work fine.

0:57:20	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:57:21	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:57:22	SPEAKER_04
 So it doesn't slow down the eye tracker.

0:57:23	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't do anything nasty.

0:57:24	SPEAKER_04
 So we can tell.

0:57:25	SPEAKER_00
 So we pay for it.

0:57:26	SPEAKER_00
 There's very small graphical bugs, but it's not.

0:57:29	SPEAKER_00
 It's not a big thing.

0:57:30	SPEAKER_00
 It's like a couple of white pixels in the course of a.

0:57:33	SPEAKER_00
 Of course, with a task.

0:57:35	SPEAKER_00
 So it's not the distract.

0:57:36	SPEAKER_00
 Nothing important.

0:57:37	SPEAKER_04
 Nothing big enough.

0:57:38	SPEAKER_04
 They're going to look at it.

0:57:39	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

0:57:40	SPEAKER_06
 So the last, I think I'm sorry, you know, I had a sort of emails from you and I probably didn't catch everything.

0:57:47	SPEAKER_06
 The problem was that there are two Camtasia records.

0:57:50	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

0:57:51	SPEAKER_01
 There will now have to be two Camtasia records because.

0:57:54	SPEAKER_01
 Each person actually sees a different screen because of.

0:57:57	SPEAKER_01
 They don't see their own gaze.

0:57:59	SPEAKER_01
 They see the only other gaze.

0:58:00	SPEAKER_01
 So there will need to be two separate Camtasia.

0:58:03	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:58:04	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, do you need to come to Camtasia to do that?

0:58:08	SPEAKER_01
 Hopefully.

0:58:10	SPEAKER_01
 Officially or.

0:58:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:58:13	SPEAKER_01
 The question is the license for Camtasia.

0:58:15	SPEAKER_00
 You just need one editing thing and two recording things because.

0:58:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, the recording.

0:58:21	SPEAKER_00
 The recording program is just quite a small program that just generates the video.

0:58:28	SPEAKER_00
 So don't forget the licensing for that just to see.

0:58:32	SPEAKER_04
 So you're going to look into this, right?

0:58:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I hadn't thought about it.

0:58:36	SPEAKER_01
 I just assume we just get one and one license code run a lot further.

0:58:40	SPEAKER_01
 So it was technically she had to look at the license conditions.

0:58:43	SPEAKER_04
 It might not.

0:58:44	SPEAKER_01
 I suspect that it will be a per machine.

0:58:47	SPEAKER_01
 I think.

0:58:48	SPEAKER_04
 I never prejudge licenses in plugred.

0:58:51	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

0:58:52	SPEAKER_01
 I'll have a look at the actual Camtasia license.

0:58:55	SPEAKER_01
 The other thing we.

0:58:58	SPEAKER_04
 Well, and hold on before we get going further.

0:59:01	SPEAKER_04
 So this has implications for data storage, right?

0:59:04	SPEAKER_04
 Because we've got, well, no, this is three times right because we've got.

0:59:08	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, no, we're going to build.

0:59:10	SPEAKER_04
 We're going to use Joe's script to build the videos on the fly, right?

0:59:13	SPEAKER_04
 Because it's fast.

0:59:14	SPEAKER_04
 So the permanent storage is just the Camtasia stuff.

0:59:17	SPEAKER_04
 So.

0:59:18	SPEAKER_04
 Is that a problem?

0:59:23	SPEAKER_04
 Where are we putting things?

0:59:25	SPEAKER_04
 Is there?

0:59:26	SPEAKER_06
 Is there such a thing as dual track video?

0:59:31	SPEAKER_06
 Because you can certainly mix things.

0:59:33	SPEAKER_06
 What ideally one wants, one doesn't really want to have these things.

0:59:37	SPEAKER_06
 Because we're using them for backup and for coding.

0:59:40	SPEAKER_06
 We don't really want to play them independently.

0:59:43	SPEAKER_06
 We almost always want to use them in exactly in parallel time aligned.

0:59:48	SPEAKER_04
 You can dump them into one video frame if you don't mind losing resolution.

0:59:52	SPEAKER_04
 But that's maybe a problem, right?

0:59:54	SPEAKER_01
 Well, the other problem is Camtasia has to be manually launched in both machines separately.

1:00:00	SPEAKER_04
 So the synchronization is going to be a problem?

1:00:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:00:03	SPEAKER_06
 What are we doing for synchronization otherwise?

1:00:05	SPEAKER_01
 During the task, there's a flash and a bleep.

1:00:08	SPEAKER_01
 Not during the task.

1:00:11	SPEAKER_01
 Before.

1:00:12	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, before we.

1:00:13	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, so that we'd have to realign them and couldn't.

1:00:17	SPEAKER_06
 Yes.

1:00:18	SPEAKER_06
 Dumps them from their start points.

1:00:19	SPEAKER_06
 Well, maybe you could.

1:00:22	SPEAKER_06
 The thing that you're dumping them onto just starts running with flash and a bleep.

1:00:25	SPEAKER_06
 You turn on the two copies whenever at different times, but they're still.

1:00:30	SPEAKER_06
 No, what are they?

1:00:33	SPEAKER_06
 I don't really understand the parts that are operating here.

1:00:37	SPEAKER_06
 Camtasia's are turning on.

1:00:39	SPEAKER_06
 There's no time stamp that comes from some common source.

1:00:42	SPEAKER_01
 No.

1:00:43	SPEAKER_01
 They're on the two separate machines and you start and end them separately.

1:00:48	SPEAKER_01
 They're not talking to each other.

1:00:50	SPEAKER_01
 They're just recording.

1:00:51	SPEAKER_01
 You start it recording and it starts recording once in one screen and you start the other recording and the other machine.

1:00:58	SPEAKER_01
 So.

1:00:59	SPEAKER_01
 They don't know.

1:01:00	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

1:01:01	SPEAKER_01
 These are backups.

1:01:02	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

1:01:03	SPEAKER_04
 So the flash allows you to hand synchronize them later if you need to buy stripping extra video off the front.

1:01:09	SPEAKER_04
 As long as you make sure you start them before the flash, then you're fine.

1:01:13	SPEAKER_04
 But there's a cost of having to go to backup, which is synchronizing them.

1:01:18	SPEAKER_06
 So they'll include things like the eye tracker calibration.

1:01:24	SPEAKER_06
 Yes.

1:01:25	SPEAKER_06
 Which is not bad thing actually.

1:01:27	SPEAKER_06
 Because sometimes you want to go back and find out if this was just a particularly duff subject.

1:01:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

1:01:32	SPEAKER_01
 See how long it took them actually.

1:01:33	SPEAKER_01
 That's true.

1:01:34	SPEAKER_01
 How long did it take them to calibrate?

1:01:36	SPEAKER_01
 Every time we calibrated the damping slip.

1:01:38	SPEAKER_01
 How many days before the validation worked or something?

1:01:41	SPEAKER_01
 So you should start the Camtasia really early then.

1:01:44	SPEAKER_01
 Well, at the moment that's why I was assuming.

1:01:47	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

1:01:48	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

1:01:49	SPEAKER_06
 No, that actually saves you hours trying to make somebody's data smooth out when it won't.

1:01:53	SPEAKER_06
 Because.

1:01:54	SPEAKER_01
 You go back and actually, yes, they were crap.

1:01:56	SPEAKER_01
 That's a technical term.

1:01:58	SPEAKER_01
 It's a technical categorization and psychological research.

1:02:02	SPEAKER_01
 The other thing we were getting started was the microphones.

1:02:07	SPEAKER_01
 Because only one of the Camtasia videos will actually have the same track.

1:02:12	SPEAKER_01
 And that's because.

1:02:17	SPEAKER_01
 We're just getting one people to the two mics.

1:02:24	SPEAKER_01
 It's supposed to be worse.

1:02:26	SPEAKER_06
 We need real sound recording.

1:02:28	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

1:02:29	SPEAKER_06
 That's two tracks.

1:02:31	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

1:02:32	SPEAKER_01
 At the moment it's in what we've finally just.

1:02:36	SPEAKER_01
 At 12 o'clock today, looks like we've got it.

1:02:40	SPEAKER_01
 Sust.

1:02:41	SPEAKER_01
 Is to get one channel, one microphone being the left channel and one being the right channel to merge into a stereo.

1:02:49	SPEAKER_01
 Go.

1:02:50	SPEAKER_01
 File.

1:02:51	SPEAKER_01
 Unfortunately.

1:02:52	SPEAKER_01
 On what?

1:02:53	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

1:02:54	SPEAKER_01
 On one machine.

1:02:56	SPEAKER_06
 On one of the.

1:02:59	SPEAKER_01
 The display piece easier, the Camtasia video.

1:03:03	SPEAKER_01
 It's.

1:03:06	SPEAKER_01
 That's not what you're putting it.

1:03:09	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, that's our only sound record.

1:03:12	SPEAKER_05
 Yes.

1:03:13	SPEAKER_04
 Well, okay.

1:03:14	SPEAKER_04
 You've got the proper sound record, but you're not dumping it through Camtasia to record it.

1:03:18	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

1:03:19	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

1:03:20	SPEAKER_01
 Camtasia is recording.

1:03:21	SPEAKER_04
 Well, before we were going to use Camtasia at all, what we were going to do, what were we going to do with the sound?

1:03:27	None
 Mm-hmm.

1:03:28	None
 Yeah.

1:03:29	SPEAKER_02
 So, is there any sound degradation that comes about from putting this through Camtasia rather than running it out straight?

1:03:36	None
 No, you got.

1:03:43	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:03:44	SPEAKER_04
 You got exactly the same access to sound quality as you got from anything else on the windows.

1:03:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

1:03:51	SPEAKER_00
 You can decide whatever quality you want.

1:04:01	SPEAKER_00
 So, whatever.

1:04:02	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

1:04:03	SPEAKER_04
 So, what you're planning on doing is bunging it on one of the Camtasia tracks and then splicing it off the Camtasia track.

1:04:08	SPEAKER_04
 It's an easy bit of.

1:04:16	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:04:17	SPEAKER_04
 And then you're going to bung it out of the other Camtasia track too if you need it, right?

1:04:21	SPEAKER_04
 But we're going to store all three separately.

1:04:25	SPEAKER_04
 Then.

1:04:26	SPEAKER_04
 And the sound is going to start at the same time as one of the arbitrary one of the Camtasia videos, but you'll know when the real experiment.

1:04:35	SPEAKER_04
 You'll know the relationship between that and the eye tracker timings.

1:04:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because the synchronization, the audio and visual synchronization comes at a specific point in the eye track file.

1:04:49	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:04:50	SPEAKER_04
 No human intervention required.

1:04:52	SPEAKER_04
 It's time stamped.

1:04:53	SPEAKER_00
 No, it's stamped into it.

1:04:55	SPEAKER_00
 So, it's just after just after it prints the line, styling experiment.

1:04:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

1:04:59	SPEAKER_00
 I'm pretty sure it's.

1:05:07	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:05:08	SPEAKER_04
 Hold on.

1:05:09	SPEAKER_04
 Do we need that?

1:05:10	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I thought the way that Tim had the setup originally, the audio, the timestamps used, there would be joint timestamps between the audio and the eye tracker.

1:05:22	SPEAKER_04
 So that, you know, the audio record.

1:05:27	SPEAKER_04
 Ten seconds in was the same as ten seconds into the eye tracker record so that we didn't have to do any extra handwork.

1:05:33	SPEAKER_04
 You know, any chopping the starts of audio signals to get.

1:05:36	SPEAKER_04
 There was nothing.

1:05:37	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

1:05:38	SPEAKER_04
 So we're relying on your MATLAB script to get us the chopped version of the audio, right?

1:05:44	SPEAKER_00
 The MATLAB script just says, yeah, it gives you the timing of the audio beep in the end signal.

1:05:52	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

1:05:53	SPEAKER_04
 So we can either adjust the eye track data or we can actually chop the audio signal.

1:05:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:05:58	SPEAKER_06
 Take off the first, whatever, 70 seconds.

1:05:59	SPEAKER_06
 There's going to be a way to sooner or later to align the eye track, Camtasia 1, Camtasia 2 with two sound channels.

1:06:09	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

1:06:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, but, but, um, lining up the Camtasia 2 is going to take, he's working on a MATLAB script for the sound, but not for.

1:06:20	SPEAKER_04
 So the one that's got the sound on it, that'll also tell you where to chop the video to get it to line up.

1:06:25	SPEAKER_04
 The one that doesn't have the sound on it, it won't.

1:06:34	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, the beep will fall.

1:06:35	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, so it's just the beep's.

1:06:37	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, okay.

1:06:38	SPEAKER_04
 So no hand synchronization required at all.

1:06:41	SPEAKER_04
 As long as the scripts work.

1:06:43	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

1:06:44	None
 Yeah.

1:06:45	None
 Okay.

1:06:53	SPEAKER_04
 Okay. How confident are you about the finding these things?

1:06:58	SPEAKER_00
 Break off.

1:06:59	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, you've seen the bit was it was.

1:07:08	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:07:09	SPEAKER_04
 So we just have to hope we don't have any subjects with odd vocalizations.

1:07:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I don't see it on a technical that's what we know.

1:07:17	SPEAKER_06
 They also tend to have a funny, funny shape.

1:07:20	SPEAKER_06
 So, yeah.

1:07:23	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

1:07:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, because this is the dropout test.

1:07:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yep.

1:07:34	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

1:07:35	SPEAKER_06
 Is there an end signal?

1:07:37	SPEAKER_06
 When you decide it's all over, does it?

1:07:39	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

1:07:40	SPEAKER_00
 There's a signal at the start and the end of every trial.

1:07:42	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

1:07:43	SPEAKER_06
 So when you when you've pressed, we're finished.

1:07:46	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

1:07:51	SPEAKER_06
 It's just that all kinds of crazy things happen when you're writing things.

1:07:54	SPEAKER_06
 So saving a percentage of a trial, sometimes a good idea.

1:07:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

1:08:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

1:08:18	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, yeah.

1:08:21	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

1:08:24	SPEAKER_00
 It's a stereo jack.

1:08:27	SPEAKER_00
 It's a stereo jack, but it's a mono microphone.

1:08:30	None
 You got a solution for that then?

1:08:32	None
 Line in.

1:08:33	None
 It's going through a line.

1:08:35	SPEAKER_04
 So it's quieter because it's not powered, but it's still.

1:08:38	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:08:39	SPEAKER_04
 We still pick up the signal.

1:08:41	SPEAKER_04
 Because, you know, people might want to use this for speech recognition or something.

1:08:44	SPEAKER_04
 You never know if the date is there.

1:08:46	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

1:08:47	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, it's crazy we're in an anacolic room, which we specially built in anacolic room.

1:08:50	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

1:08:51	SPEAKER_06
 It's not dead in the room, which we specially built for this.

1:08:53	SPEAKER_06
 And you're going to want for some line answers.

1:08:55	SPEAKER_06
 We shouldn't screw it up more than we have to.

1:08:57	SPEAKER_06
 Is there anything we can do to improve this?

1:09:01	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, no.

1:09:02	SPEAKER_04
 No, no.

1:09:03	SPEAKER_04
 Better to collect it sort of.

1:09:04	SPEAKER_05
 Do you have a powered microphone or something?

1:09:06	SPEAKER_00
 Well, when they're out there, they're out there.

1:09:08	SPEAKER_00
 So they have batteries in them, but it's not.

1:09:11	SPEAKER_00
 It doesn't seem to be powered because of the line in it.

1:09:13	SPEAKER_00
 Inputs are low.

1:09:14	SPEAKER_04
 Wait, wait.

1:09:15	SPEAKER_04
 I thought a solution was fixing this problem with a model microphone socket.

1:09:19	SPEAKER_04
 Sound card?

1:09:20	SPEAKER_04
 So you said the problem was the.

1:09:23	SPEAKER_04
 The sound of the sound is.

1:09:25	SPEAKER_05
 The sound is.

1:09:26	SPEAKER_06
 The input is mono.

1:09:28	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

1:09:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

1:09:30	SPEAKER_00
 The jack that is plugged into is stereo.

1:09:33	SPEAKER_00
 But when it's recording from microphone, it records in mono.

1:09:37	SPEAKER_04
 So is that fixable?

1:09:39	SPEAKER_04
 Like is there any way we're in the sound card?

1:09:41	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:09:42	SPEAKER_04
 And these sound cards are better solutions than monkeying about with trying to filter white knives out.

1:09:47	SPEAKER_00
 I think we remember the out front ten.

1:09:50	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that's what one thing you do is record the speech signal separately for each person.

1:09:56	SPEAKER_00
 But then you have to pull the two sounds together.

1:09:59	SPEAKER_04
 Which isn't hard.

1:10:00	SPEAKER_00
 But if each machine recorded the sound, we recorded the recording.

1:10:05	SPEAKER_06
 So you have to line the videos anyway.

1:10:10	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

1:10:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

1:10:12	None
 Yeah.

1:10:13	None
 Yeah.

1:10:14	None
 Yeah.

1:10:15	None
 And then it's the.

1:10:16	SPEAKER_04
 It's easy.

1:10:17	SPEAKER_04
 I'm not the technical person.

1:10:21	SPEAKER_04
 It's not.

1:10:22	SPEAKER_06
 It's not.

1:10:23	SPEAKER_00
 I was thinking in a MATLAB script, you just read for one read felt T.

1:10:27	SPEAKER_00
 And then.

1:10:28	SPEAKER_04
 So is there any reason why we don't do that?

1:10:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

1:10:37	SPEAKER_00
 But then the math script will tell you how far apart there.

1:10:41	SPEAKER_00
 You can just measure the drift between the two of them.

1:10:43	SPEAKER_00
 You get a list of where the beeps are.

1:10:45	SPEAKER_00
 And then you say, right, this stream is like, I don't know, 0.25 seconds behind the other

1:10:50	None
 one. Says Robin thinking about cutting and splicing.

1:10:56	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

1:10:57	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:10:58	SPEAKER_04
 Well, it's in the old days, we probably would have.

1:11:02	SPEAKER_04
 If they'd been in the same room, we would have read a little stereo thing in the background as backup as well, just to make sure because it's slightly dicier.

1:11:09	SPEAKER_04
 You know, if his scripts don't work.

1:11:11	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:11:12	SPEAKER_06
 I want to see.

1:11:13	SPEAKER_06
 I want to see one of them look really nice before we start running subjects.

1:11:17	SPEAKER_06
 Can we do that?

1:11:19	SPEAKER_04
 It doesn't have to be a real trial.

1:11:20	SPEAKER_04
 It just has to be two guys talking in the two bits.

1:11:23	SPEAKER_06
 And then I just want to know it works the way you expect it to work.

1:11:26	SPEAKER_06
 This is not a gesture of mistrust.

1:11:28	SPEAKER_06
 This is just experience that if anything can screw up, it will.

1:11:32	SPEAKER_06
 We've both been so badly picked in the past.

1:11:37	SPEAKER_06
 I'm trying to choose my language carefully because we're being recorded.

1:11:40	SPEAKER_06
 We're here more choice language at the point when we've all done a lot of work and then we discover we can't use the session because of something we didn't think about.

1:11:51	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

1:11:52	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:11:53	SPEAKER_04
 But this sounds reasonable to me.

1:11:55	SPEAKER_04
 So I think.

1:11:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

1:11:58	SPEAKER_04
 Do they both have the same sound card problem?

1:12:06	SPEAKER_04
 I wouldn't count on it.

1:12:08	SPEAKER_00
 They've both got the same sound card.

1:12:10	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

1:12:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

1:12:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

1:12:13	None
 Yeah.

1:12:14	None
 Yeah.

1:12:15	SPEAKER_06
 It's probably worth mentioning this to the guys in the garage in Toronto, right?

1:12:20	SPEAKER_06
 To say.

1:12:21	SPEAKER_06
 Yes.

1:12:22	SPEAKER_01
 Yes.

1:12:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

1:12:33	SPEAKER_00
 So the external version has got plugs that size.

1:12:38	SPEAKER_00
 And that is stereo microphones.

1:12:40	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

1:12:41	SPEAKER_00
 But yeah, the other one is like the smaller size and that isn't stereo.

1:12:45	SPEAKER_00
 So the card can do it.

1:12:47	SPEAKER_00
 It's just that the connectors on the back of the computer can't.

1:12:51	SPEAKER_00
 Well, yeah.

1:12:52	SPEAKER_06
 I think tell the guys that's a, if the documentation said it could record in stereo, then I think we should talk to them about how they've done this.

1:13:01	SPEAKER_06
 Is you not sure from the documentation what it says it can do?

1:13:05	None
 That's quite a trouble.

1:13:07	None
 It's finding it.

1:13:08	None
 It's a concern.

1:13:09	None
 And what's your work with the size?

1:13:12	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:13:13	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:13:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

1:13:15	SPEAKER_00
 But as far as we can do and find the website of the, yeah, the creative labs website and the review of it.

1:13:21	SPEAKER_00
 And they weren't entirely clear, but they both suggested that it, that it was a mono, that it was a mono microphone.

1:13:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

1:13:28	None
 And it's not the people that are interested in other things, but I'm more interested in the other things.

1:13:33	None
 Yeah.

1:13:34	SPEAKER_04
 It's just the way they're wired it.

1:13:39	SPEAKER_04
 So it's getting late and I've got a two o'clock and I've got a nice lunch.

1:13:44	SPEAKER_04
 So I want to eat my lunch today.

1:13:48	SPEAKER_04
 What did you want to get through today?

1:13:50	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, I think it was useful going through your expectations about this because that's quite a bit clearer in my head at least.

1:13:58	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:13:59	SPEAKER_04
 But I think mostly we leave you to go away and redesign the GDF or add new bits to the GDF along these lines.

1:14:07	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

1:14:08	SPEAKER_00
 So basically the output of the GDF is just going to be a whole series of events.

1:14:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

1:14:13	SPEAKER_00
 With starting in time and the event's going to have whatever, whatever the object is that's been looked at and things.

1:14:18	SPEAKER_00
 And then, yeah, and then it's a matter of we can put whatever filters we need after that so you can say, right?

1:14:24	SPEAKER_00
 I just want to say from the time where they picked up triangle one to the part time it became part of the assembly, find out how much how much percentage of time they were looking at it or whatever.

1:14:33	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

1:14:34	SPEAKER_06
 So given that there are these events recorded, we can use any of them as the beginning of any of them as a start point, for example, right?

1:14:42	SPEAKER_06
 There are also motions being recorded of objects.

1:14:45	SPEAKER_06
 Yep.

1:14:46	SPEAKER_00
 So there's movements, there's look events.

1:14:48	SPEAKER_00
 There's fixations of blinks in there at the moment as well.

1:14:52	SPEAKER_00
 And yeah, and see, looks at objects and looks wherever else.

1:14:59	SPEAKER_04
 But I think the thing to do is for you to go away and think about it this way with the different tracks, the different objects and the kinds of things we've added about whether they're looking at the other person's gaze and what have you.

1:15:11	SPEAKER_04
 And try to change the spec so it reflects this and maybe by that point there will be some sample data or something.

1:15:22	SPEAKER_04
 And the right thing to do is for us to look at the spec the way you understand it now and some data.

1:15:29	SPEAKER_04
 And then Alan will have new ideas about what's needed or about these post analyses.

1:15:33	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:15:34	SPEAKER_04
 And then we can add them in.

1:15:36	SPEAKER_04
 But it's going to emerge over time.

1:15:37	SPEAKER_05
 That's clear.

1:15:38	SPEAKER_06
 That's great.

1:15:41	SPEAKER_06
 Before we break up for lunch, I just want to make sure that I know how long it's going to be before we run mode.

1:15:49	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

1:15:50	SPEAKER_06
 So the sound thing is stands in our way.

1:15:54	SPEAKER_06
 We need to be recording sound online.

1:15:56	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

1:15:57	SPEAKER_06
 So that's the thing that has to be solved.

1:15:58	SPEAKER_06
 The shape thing is solved.

1:16:00	None
 Yeah.

1:16:01	SPEAKER_04
 That's solved now.

1:16:03	SPEAKER_04
 We think.

1:16:04	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:16:05	SPEAKER_04
 Test.

1:16:06	SPEAKER_04
 We believe.

1:16:07	SPEAKER_05
 We have to test.

1:16:08	SPEAKER_06
 So that's that should be done this week.

1:16:11	SPEAKER_06
 In fact, like tomorrow, for example, the shape, all the shape problems are solved.

1:16:18	SPEAKER_06
 Generating shapes, no problem.

1:16:22	SPEAKER_06
 Scoring shape overlap, no problem.

1:16:24	SPEAKER_06
 Nothing is a problem.

1:16:25	SPEAKER_06
 There are no visual display.

1:16:27	SPEAKER_03
 You don't have your models, how do you?

1:16:29	SPEAKER_06
 What is, how do you know that the model is a different from frame?

1:16:38	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, they had their inspection last week.

1:16:42	SPEAKER_06
 JP staggered away from it.

1:16:44	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

1:17:05	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:17:07	SPEAKER_04
 Well, anything you actually need fixed.

1:17:10	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:17:15	SPEAKER_04
 Joe doesn't live here anymore, right?

1:17:20	SPEAKER_04
 Well, but he wasn't going to be booking any time to us after the 31st of October.

1:17:25	SPEAKER_04
 So that means that any bugs that need fixed in our correct responsibility, right?

1:17:33	SPEAKER_04
 You don't know any change on that, right?

1:17:37	SPEAKER_04
 That's what he said to us originally.

1:17:40	SPEAKER_04
 So I would assume, you know, no more contact with Joe.

1:17:42	SPEAKER_04
 It's not fair to get work out of somebody for free.

1:17:45	SPEAKER_04
 So, you know, ask Craig instead.

1:17:50	SPEAKER_06
 Well, he's physically here.

1:17:52	SPEAKER_06
 We want to pay him for some more time.

1:17:54	SPEAKER_06
 You can do that.

1:17:55	SPEAKER_06
 Would that be a just better use of our time and get?

1:18:01	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

1:18:03	SPEAKER_04
 Well, he wasn't paid in advance.

1:18:06	SPEAKER_04
 He was being paid in a rear, so it doesn't matter.

1:18:11	SPEAKER_06
 I think he is around, and I believe.

1:18:14	SPEAKER_04
 I think it's better to have all the software.

1:18:17	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, it's not big things.

1:18:18	SPEAKER_04
 It's just maintenance of this program at this point.

1:18:21	SPEAKER_06
 But if everybody has a lot to do and, you know, Joe could give it a couple of hours, which is what it might take just to fix it, then let's do it because starting run time is not getting to be.

1:18:31	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

1:18:32	SPEAKER_04
 You know, like, because the problem is you've got to have it immediately when you discover a bug in that.

1:18:36	SPEAKER_04
 And we can make Craig shift all his other priorities to do this because we bought him.

1:18:40	SPEAKER_04
 Right.

1:18:41	SPEAKER_04
 But we can't.

1:18:42	SPEAKER_06
 We can't make Joe do this.

1:18:43	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

1:18:44	SPEAKER_06
 So it's kind of between availability and speed from start to finish, given that this is somebody else's code.

1:18:49	SPEAKER_04
 But it sounds like you don't think there's anything that actually needs fixed at the moment because we only need this to work well enough that you can use it for something.

1:18:57	SPEAKER_04
 We've got more products.

1:18:58	SPEAKER_06
 We're building models.

1:18:59	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

1:19:00	SPEAKER_04
 And how many models do you need to completion and how long does that take?

1:19:04	SPEAKER_06
 You have the design and some.

1:19:08	SPEAKER_04
 And you got.

1:19:11	SPEAKER_04
 Well, and you know about complexity.

1:19:14	SPEAKER_01
 Well, that's what I'm waiting for.

1:19:16	SPEAKER_04
 You're waiting on Marlous.

1:19:24	SPEAKER_04
 You can cold call her today this afternoon.

1:19:28	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

1:19:30	SPEAKER_06
 I think so.

1:19:32	SPEAKER_06
 I have to check back with JP fairly soon.

1:19:36	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

1:19:37	SPEAKER_06
 You wanted to.

1:19:40	SPEAKER_06
 The next 18 month plan.

1:19:43	SPEAKER_06
 Great.

1:19:44	SPEAKER_06
 Deliberables.

1:19:45	SPEAKER_06
 Great progress with the experiment.

1:19:47	SPEAKER_06
 Well, that's what we're doing now.

1:19:48	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

1:19:49	SPEAKER_06
 So what do we think if you have a fairly hectic week, are we looking for subjects next week?

1:19:55	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

1:19:58	SPEAKER_06
 Ads go up.

1:20:00	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, I do.

1:20:01	SPEAKER_06
 I do.

1:20:02	SPEAKER_06
 But I think ads should probably go up this week.

1:20:04	SPEAKER_06
 We want people for next week.

1:20:06	SPEAKER_06
 Is that okay?

1:20:07	SPEAKER_06
 Is anybody now terrified at the thought that we're live next week?

1:20:10	SPEAKER_06
 There are people coming in here.

1:20:12	SPEAKER_06
 One after another or two after two more likely.

1:20:17	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

1:20:18	SPEAKER_06
 Is this generalized is this generalized anxiety Robin or do you have a specific thing that.

1:20:24	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

1:20:25	SPEAKER_06
 So aside from the usual angst which we all suffer when we go live.

1:20:32	SPEAKER_06
 So we want to do some piloting at the end of the week.

1:20:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yep.

1:20:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

1:20:37	SPEAKER_00
 So we'll get the audio stuff tested.

1:20:39	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

1:20:40	SPEAKER_00
 Single mic friends.

1:20:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

1:20:42	SPEAKER_00
 Get that test in a couple days.

1:20:44	SPEAKER_00
 I assume that's something you need me for in terms of that.

1:20:47	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

1:20:55	SPEAKER_06
 Oh yeah.

1:20:56	SPEAKER_06
 But she's actually relaxed that somewhat.

1:20:58	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

1:20:59	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

1:21:00	None
 Yeah.

1:21:01	None
 Yeah.

1:21:02	None
 Mm-hmm.

1:21:03	None
 Mm-hmm.

1:21:04	SPEAKER_03
 Mm-hmm.

1:21:05	None
 Mm-hmm.

1:21:06	None
 Mm-hmm.

1:21:07	None
 Mm-hmm.

1:21:08	None
 Mm-hmm.

1:21:09	None
 Mm-hmm.

1:21:10	None
 Mm-hmm.

1:21:11	None
 Mm-hmm.

1:21:12	None
 Mm-hmm.

1:21:13	None
 Mm-hmm.

1:21:14	None
 Mm-hmm.

1:21:15	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, stensive blue book time, which isn't.

1:21:19	SPEAKER_04
 So you can dash in there for half an hour at a time.

1:21:22	SPEAKER_04
 Doesn't sound very useful for you.

1:21:24	None
 It's...

1:21:25	SPEAKER_05
 Uh-huh.

1:21:26	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

1:21:27	SPEAKER_05
 Well, you guys started out.

1:21:29	SPEAKER_06
 We have a solid booking for all the mornings anyway.

1:21:32	SPEAKER_06
 Right?

1:21:33	SPEAKER_06
 Except by permission of us.

1:21:35	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

1:21:36	SPEAKER_06
 We own it.

1:21:37	SPEAKER_06
 So we can change that.

1:21:39	SPEAKER_06
 I mean, everybody acknowledged the other week that we...

1:21:42	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

1:21:43	SPEAKER_06
 But it would be kind to tell her ahead of time, which of your morning sessions you're booking.

1:21:46	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:21:47	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

1:21:48	SPEAKER_06
 Don't worry.

1:21:49	SPEAKER_06
 There's a booking system.

1:21:51	SPEAKER_06
 Right?

1:21:52	SPEAKER_06
 So it's public.

1:21:53	SPEAKER_06
 What's booked and what is it?

1:21:54	SPEAKER_04
 Mm-hmm.

1:21:55	SPEAKER_04
 I thought that was a problem that your mornings weren't sliced up on the booking system.

1:21:58	None
 Yeah.

1:21:59	SPEAKER_06
 Mm-hmm.

1:22:00	SPEAKER_06
 All right.

1:22:01	SPEAKER_06
 Maybe you should get on there and book mornings as far as the eye can see.

1:22:06	SPEAKER_06
 Does, you know, if you're told, use the booking system.

1:22:11	SPEAKER_06
 We think we spoke to all the people who used those facilities the other day, but we could be wrong.

1:22:17	SPEAKER_06
 So...

1:22:18	None
 Yeah.

1:22:19	SPEAKER_04
 And one of the people upstairs, downstairs, have, you know, as rules about who you hand the keys to.

1:22:30	SPEAKER_04
 Well, there's a key goal to do.

1:22:32	SPEAKER_04
 Because, you know, we like people to know to ground the...

1:22:34	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, I thought the lending for the booking system.

1:22:37	SPEAKER_06
 Caroline.

1:22:38	SPEAKER_06
 From Caroline?

1:22:39	SPEAKER_06
 Oh, the general office.

1:22:41	SPEAKER_06
 The general office.

1:22:42	SPEAKER_05
 See, because you're supposed to have training in...

1:22:44	SPEAKER_06
 But no, they need an account on this machine to actually use it.

1:22:48	SPEAKER_06
 They need an account on these machines.

1:22:49	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, okay.

1:22:50	SPEAKER_05
 So that's the same thing.

1:22:51	SPEAKER_05
 So that they could book.

1:22:52	SPEAKER_04
 They couldn't actually...

1:22:53	SPEAKER_04
 And you control those accounts.

1:22:54	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, okay.

1:22:55	SPEAKER_06
 That's fair enough.

1:22:56	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

1:22:57	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

1:22:58	SPEAKER_06
 We're also working on a way of making sure that the machines return to zero state when they're...

1:23:02	SPEAKER_06
 Uh-huh.

1:23:03	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

1:23:04	SPEAKER_06
 When you come off.

1:23:05	SPEAKER_04
 That's safe.

1:23:06	SPEAKER_06
 Because then they learn the first time.

1:23:07	SPEAKER_06
 Well, people have been leaving various bits of who knows what around them, right?

1:23:11	SPEAKER_06
 Which we think is what's critical.

1:23:14	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, yeah.

1:23:22	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

1:23:23	SPEAKER_04
 I really have to get out of here.

1:23:25	SPEAKER_04
 So, what else is important before you run?

1:23:28	SPEAKER_05
 Nothing, right?

1:23:30	SPEAKER_05
 Piloting, piloting, piloting.

1:23:31	SPEAKER_06
 You have to build the things you have to try the machines.

1:23:34	SPEAKER_06
 The machines, things we have to check them with Marlos and JP that they like the representation of the variables, right?

1:23:43	SPEAKER_06
 How about...

1:23:44	SPEAKER_06
 Do you have any time on Friday?

1:23:45	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, I don't think I brought my diary up.

1:23:48	SPEAKER_04
 But maybe...

1:23:49	SPEAKER_06
 Why?

1:23:50	SPEAKER_06
 Maybe you and I should be the pilot subjects.

1:23:52	SPEAKER_06
 First pilot subjects, the ones who know which questions we want to ask.

1:23:56	SPEAKER_06
 And then we should get another pair who are naive to the whole thing.

1:24:00	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

1:24:01	SPEAKER_02
 So...

1:24:02	None
 Yeah.

1:24:03	SPEAKER_02
 This is generalized floating anxiety.

1:24:08	SPEAKER_06
 No, no.

1:24:09	SPEAKER_06
 It's wisdom, but yeah.

1:24:13	SPEAKER_06
 Well, because actually we can...

1:24:16	SPEAKER_06
 We make comments.

1:24:17	SPEAKER_06
 They keep backing a vote into the development.

1:24:22	SPEAKER_04
 So, do you know what time of day you might want?

1:24:27	SPEAKER_04
 Because I should check that.

1:24:32	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

1:24:37	SPEAKER_00
 You don't need me involved in the pilot there.

1:24:42	SPEAKER_00
 Well...

1:24:43	SPEAKER_00
 You all have to be there.

1:24:44	SPEAKER_00
 You all have to be there too.

1:24:46	SPEAKER_00
 I'll be around, but yeah, I'll be sure.

1:24:50	SPEAKER_00
 Hopefully it all runs smoothly.

1:24:53	SPEAKER_00
 I can relax.

1:24:55	SPEAKER_04
 Okay.

1:24:56	SPEAKER_04
 So that all sounds good fun.

1:25:01	None
 Okay.

1:25:06	SPEAKER_04
 Well, I can just leave you guys here.

1:25:20	SPEAKER_04
 Why not?

1:25:27	None
 Okay.

1:25:37	None
 Okay.

1:26:06	None
 Okay.

1:26:21	None
 Okay.

1:26:38	None
 Okay.

1:26:59	None
 Okay.

1:27:20	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

1:27:44	None
 Okay.

1:28:05	None
 Okay.

1:28:26	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.
