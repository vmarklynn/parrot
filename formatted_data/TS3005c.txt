SPEAKER_02: How far do you find?
SPEAKER_02: What's the door?
None: Dude, dude, dude.
None: What's the door?
SPEAKER_02: Transmeter, huh?
SPEAKER_02: Transmeter.
None: Yeah.
None: Yall.
None: So, if you can say, if you can see here, like a little box, it's like a sheet of tape.
None: That's also a door.
SPEAKER_04: What's it called?
SPEAKER_01: Transmeter.
SPEAKER_04: JBL on the wall.
None: JBL on the wall.
None: No.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, that's not good, right?
SPEAKER_02: What in that queue?
None: Move the meeting room and bring that door.
None: It's like the internet drive.
None: You have to say something.
None: He's not always fast.
None: No, no, no.
None: I'm going to have to wait for you in the meantime, but I have to pay more attention.
None: Yeah, I can talk to you.
None: You should speak, you know.
None: Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.
None: Sorry.
SPEAKER_00: Sorry.
SPEAKER_03: Have a trip.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, welcome everyone to our next meeting.
SPEAKER_03: I have prepared a little presentation once again, or at least an agenda.
SPEAKER_03: The biggest part of the presentation will be on your side.
SPEAKER_03: We are here at the conceptual design meeting, which is here by opened.
SPEAKER_03: Once again, I will try to write some minutes, which I just, from the previous meeting, placed inside our project folder, which was quite some typing.
SPEAKER_03: Today, we once again have three presentations, if I'm right.
SPEAKER_03: And after that, we will take a decision on the remote control concept.
SPEAKER_03: And just as the last time we have 40 minutes to accomplish that.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, well, let's start with the first presentation in the same order as last time.
SPEAKER_03: Take it away.
SPEAKER_02: Bling.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, welcome.
SPEAKER_02: You all.
SPEAKER_02: Component design.
SPEAKER_02: Before I would like to accommodate some of those things I elaborate some of the things I did.
SPEAKER_02: I elaborated on the concept.
SPEAKER_02: What should be said about the components, its properties and what kind of materials we use to make one of those remote controls?
SPEAKER_02: First of all, I've subtracted some of the components that are used from what the remote control is formed.
SPEAKER_02: First of all, the case, the case, the surrounding of the remote control.
SPEAKER_02: I would like to give you an idea of how I thought about the true materials.
SPEAKER_02: The materials gone there.
SPEAKER_02: The case is made from rubber, I suppose, because when you use the remote control, a lot of people will drop the remote control in the break because the titanium was also an option.
SPEAKER_02: But it's a very expensive material.
SPEAKER_02: I think the best suitable material to use for remote control.
SPEAKER_02: It's also possible to create fancy colors with rubber.
SPEAKER_02: It makes it easy to let itself color.
SPEAKER_02: Rubber, the total piece of rubber that's used to make the case is the same color.
SPEAKER_02: If you scratch it, it's still the same color.
SPEAKER_02: Perhaps it's a little bit damaged.
SPEAKER_02: But it's a very strong material.
SPEAKER_02: I had an idea. It's single curved.
SPEAKER_02: It's too dimensional.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's best drawn green.
SPEAKER_00: It's a color.
SPEAKER_02: It's a brass color.
SPEAKER_02: New.
SPEAKER_02: Forward blank.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Let's make it black.
SPEAKER_02: I thought of an idea like this.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, not that.
SPEAKER_02: Blank.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: It also looks nice when it's on your table.
SPEAKER_02: It doesn't lay flat down on the table, but it stands.
SPEAKER_02: It's a side view.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, it's a side view.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not technically good at 3D modeling.
SPEAKER_02: It's just an idea I had.
SPEAKER_02: It also looks nice when it's on the table.
SPEAKER_02: The graphical user interface and the buttons.
SPEAKER_02: We also thought about that already.
SPEAKER_02: I thought about the LCD touch screen, which is easy to clean too.
SPEAKER_02: One of the great advantages of the LCD screen is just to use some classics or other cleaning stuff.
SPEAKER_02: It should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright.
SPEAKER_02: I already explained some properties of that material.
SPEAKER_02: I think, oh, you also almost concluded about that.
SPEAKER_02: This should be our two button component.
SPEAKER_02: That's all about the buttons.
SPEAKER_02: We also thought about that already.
SPEAKER_02: It will be chargeable with an option for a mount station.
SPEAKER_02: You can put the remote control in a mount station.
SPEAKER_02: It charges itself up instead of plugging it in or something like that.
SPEAKER_02: Questions?
SPEAKER_02: No, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_02: Just looking.
SPEAKER_02: They should be long lasting.
SPEAKER_02: Not via MTA in about two minutes or 30 minutes or 40 minutes of use.
SPEAKER_02: The next step is the chip.
SPEAKER_02: The component that makes or transmits the signal to the television.
SPEAKER_02: There was an option to use a rather simple chip, but I think because of our highly requiring requirements.
SPEAKER_02: There should be an advanced chip in it with also the ability to facilitate speech recognition.
SPEAKER_02: Unfortunately, it's still in a test phase.
SPEAKER_02: There should be some more investigation on that side.
SPEAKER_02: My personal preference is, I also overheard in the last meeting that we should use our own business scholars.
SPEAKER_02: That was correct, wasn't it?
SPEAKER_02: I think they are rather boring for use with rubber.
SPEAKER_03: Well, business scholars, I thought it was the slogan and the corporate image.
SPEAKER_02: They should be in mind, wasn't it?
SPEAKER_03: But I don't think you have to make the entire thing in there.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so it doesn't have to have the slogan recognized.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_02: Well, that's possible, of course.
SPEAKER_02: You could make a little R&R on the top of the machine.
SPEAKER_02: So they are pretty boring, I suggest because the availability with rubber to make fantastic colors.
SPEAKER_02: And also, in a lot of possible colors, so it's possible to make very fancy remote controls, which people, in which people will find their interesting.
SPEAKER_02: And we'll buy them faster when they look at the same old gray or black colors.
SPEAKER_02: As I said before, rubber is impossible to damage severely.
SPEAKER_02: Instead of, of course, you can break it when you break it, for example, with paracysses or something like that.
SPEAKER_02: But if you drop it, it's not broken right away.
SPEAKER_02: Instead of using plastic, hard plastic or titanium.
SPEAKER_02: And I personally like the single curved remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Because it makes it fancy.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. Well, that's all about my findings.
SPEAKER_03: All right.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, thank you.
SPEAKER_03: I will go next.
SPEAKER_00: All right, so I saw a little bit about the interface.
SPEAKER_00: I should look.
SPEAKER_00: The term that there will be no buttons, but only an LCD screen, so I have to look on that.
SPEAKER_00: And the design is therefore based on what we just thought of.
SPEAKER_00: First, there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition.
SPEAKER_00: And this is that you ask, you give a question through the device.
SPEAKER_00: And it answers you.
SPEAKER_00: And they already put this in a coffee maker.
SPEAKER_00: And so that you say, good morning, coffee maker.
SPEAKER_00: And it says, says, do you back?
SPEAKER_00: Good morning, Joe, or what's your name?
SPEAKER_00: This is an easy way to program that.
SPEAKER_00: You say, record into the device, into the speaker.
SPEAKER_00: And then you say the question and three seconds later, you say the answer.
SPEAKER_00: And then when you say the question, it gives you the answer.
SPEAKER_00: Perhaps it's useful, but because people lose the remote, they can yell.
SPEAKER_00: Remote, where are you?
SPEAKER_00: And that's because that calls for something.
SPEAKER_00: That's true.
SPEAKER_00: And perhaps you could implement that.
SPEAKER_00: And then I have to go out of the presentation, because I try to make some kind of ID or what you do, but I can draw.
SPEAKER_00: Don't make too much of it.
SPEAKER_00: I try to the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_00: I try to draw.
SPEAKER_00: I thought at least the icon for the volume.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if there's an icon for the program, but...
SPEAKER_00: Just be.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, just be.
SPEAKER_00: And then the buttons above and below, the mute button, also very nice, as an icon.
SPEAKER_05: So what's the button for two digits?
SPEAKER_00: I forgot that one.
SPEAKER_00: I thought I forgot something.
SPEAKER_00: And the numbers, it should be a bit larger, I think.
SPEAKER_00: It's not really on scale and...
SPEAKER_00: No.
SPEAKER_00: An options button.
SPEAKER_00: And I thought the button for the tail text apart, because it's not really options, I think.
SPEAKER_00: Options are the settings of the remote and of the TV and that kind of thing.
SPEAKER_00: You could call it settings or something.
SPEAKER_00: But this is a bit how I thought it.
SPEAKER_00: And the LCD somewhere on your remote, perhaps you could be more curvy to remote perhaps.
SPEAKER_00: So that's better in your hand or something.
SPEAKER_00: And a microphone for the speech recognition if you want to implement that.
SPEAKER_00: And then if you press the options button, we have an example of...
SPEAKER_00: And then you should get the other options with what you could do and that you could do with something like this.
SPEAKER_00: It's also...
SPEAKER_00: I think we discussed earlier that older people don't really want to use these extra settings.
SPEAKER_00: And older people also don't really want to use this kind of option we use.
SPEAKER_00: So they want to use one button and then something happens.
SPEAKER_00: And not choose with this kind of...
SPEAKER_00: And you could put a really scrolling device on the side of your remote.
SPEAKER_00: So you could scroll across these things.
SPEAKER_00: That's an option.
SPEAKER_00: And that was my finding thing.
SPEAKER_03: Thanks.
SPEAKER_03: Third.
SPEAKER_04: No daddy.
SPEAKER_03: Remember this presentation.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: I'm going to tell you something about the trend washing.
SPEAKER_05: The trends from the past years, what people like, what youngsters like, what elderly people like, about shapes, colors, material and stuff.
SPEAKER_05: The way that I use was...
SPEAKER_05: Like I told, I watched the trends from past years about color shapes, material they wanted from elderly and young people.
SPEAKER_05: So we can keep that in mind for designing the files itself.
SPEAKER_05: Files are made.
SPEAKER_05: The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look fancy.
SPEAKER_05: The second important thing that should be enough in a fadive.
SPEAKER_05: Like the LCD screen that's quite innovative.
SPEAKER_05: So that should be great meeting for this.
SPEAKER_05: And the third thing is it should be East Use.
SPEAKER_05: I think with only one menu for button channel volume, it should also be enough for East Use.
SPEAKER_05: The personal preferences for the young people, they liked fruity colors, like banana yellow, strawberry red and stuff.
SPEAKER_05: Grass green.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, like that.
SPEAKER_05: The round shapes and soft materials, like the rubber, it should be soft, it should be feeling spongy or sponge bob.
SPEAKER_00: Like this.
SPEAKER_00: Let's build it into a sponge.
SPEAKER_05: Elderly people like colors which you are being seen in autumn, like wood, dark brown, red, deep red and stuff.
SPEAKER_05: They like square shapes with round edges and hard materials like wood, titanium, those kind of materials they like.
SPEAKER_05: This is a bit like the young people's like, the fruity colors, innovative, all the colors you see the blue, the red, the white, yellow, that stuff.
SPEAKER_05: And then I personally thought a front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like this or something.
SPEAKER_05: It's a bit like banana and the color should be yellow or something.
SPEAKER_05: And for the elderly people just plain old because we decided to have two kind of remotes, two designs or was it two colors?
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, different colors, yeah. We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes.
SPEAKER_05: I think like my colleague, you said, is that it's better or for the elderly people something like the iPod or something with round squares.
SPEAKER_05: Simple but easy to use.
SPEAKER_05: So that's it.
SPEAKER_05: That's why people are more traditional. Yeah, like the older colors I can maybe...
SPEAKER_00: You could change the colors that was also the only shape you should take.
SPEAKER_03: The colors are easy to change.
SPEAKER_02: Change the shape of the old one.
SPEAKER_00: Perhaps you could find something in the middle. Round corners but square.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe then both groups won't buy it.
SPEAKER_00: If you do it square with round corners but a little in the middle.
SPEAKER_02: I know what you mean, you kind of like a mouse bone.
SPEAKER_00: Like this.
SPEAKER_00: So it's a bit square but it's also a bit...
SPEAKER_02: Kind of like a beer glass.
SPEAKER_00: So but then...
SPEAKER_00: I know what you mean. Same size.
SPEAKER_02: It's also easy to put in your hand.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but it's also how other remotes are shaped.
SPEAKER_00: So that's...
SPEAKER_00: Perhaps that's good thing. So that's easy to use.
SPEAKER_00: People know that.
SPEAKER_02: We'll recognize that's a remote control.
SPEAKER_02: What I saw in your...
SPEAKER_05: Something like that. You know, autumn colors like red, brown.
SPEAKER_05: They like the wood a lot.
SPEAKER_05: So maybe we could give it like a wooden look or something.
SPEAKER_05: A bit old-school style.
SPEAKER_05: Red, suns, medieval.
SPEAKER_05: That's what it's all about.
SPEAKER_05: That's kind of things.
SPEAKER_05: So you see the big difference between the young people.
SPEAKER_05: Fresh, exciting.
SPEAKER_05: And old people.
SPEAKER_05: That's easy to look at.
SPEAKER_05: So, sorry.
SPEAKER_00: That's easy to do with the color.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, I think it's easier to do in color than in shape.
SPEAKER_05: Otherwise we have to get different shapes and colors just way easier than shapes.
SPEAKER_05: And material, yeah, rubber.
SPEAKER_05: Rubber is like I said, young people like more soft materials.
SPEAKER_05: They're spongy ones.
SPEAKER_05: And the old people like plain wood.
SPEAKER_05: So we have to decide if we're going to use re-hards rubber or soft rubber.
SPEAKER_05: Or something.
SPEAKER_05: Something between that.
SPEAKER_05: Soft rubber.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, soft rubber.
SPEAKER_05: Which you can feel in it.
SPEAKER_05: I know you.
SPEAKER_02: No, I think you should be promoted.
SPEAKER_05: No, or what should be next.
SPEAKER_05: No, no, but you have to like like a erase or something.
SPEAKER_05: That's a bit you can press it in or something harder.
SPEAKER_00: But like this kind of rubber.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, something like this, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Quite hard.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, quite hard, but you can press it in.
SPEAKER_05: It feels kind of spongy.
SPEAKER_05: spongy.
SPEAKER_05: Something like this.
SPEAKER_04: No, think it's rubber.
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no.
SPEAKER_03: So we need a spongy feeling.
SPEAKER_00: If you have something.
SPEAKER_04: We're going to invite SpongeBob.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe he can.
SPEAKER_00: So we should first decide about shape, I think.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think it's a better thing to do.
SPEAKER_00: Then you can fit the LCD screen in it.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, I can't help it.
None: I can't help it.
SPEAKER_02: I also can't help it.
SPEAKER_02: Notice, as you used, you had a remote control, but the LCD screen was rather small.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think the LCD screen should be like your size.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But I think it should be larger.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, three quarter of the, three quarters.
SPEAKER_02: So you don't have to put your,
SPEAKER_05: but it won't get that small when LCD screen is.
SPEAKER_02: So when you got this. Can I like this?
SPEAKER_02: Or should it be larger, I think.
SPEAKER_02: Larger, because you want to put your hands.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, because you can put your hands there.
SPEAKER_00: And then you won't touch the screen.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, true, true, true, true.
SPEAKER_02: You're thumb here.
SPEAKER_00: But not on the screen, because.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: That's all the side.
SPEAKER_00: Because when you put your hands on it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but if you make the LCD screen as large as the remote control itself, you always get some.
SPEAKER_02: You always touch it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: You can be very greasy and stuff, but you won't get that small, because you have how much?
SPEAKER_05: 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 buttons on the screen.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: You don't want it too small.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, how large?
SPEAKER_05: You have to, you have to, because some fat people would thick fingers.
SPEAKER_05: You have to keep your dress tree, but it's the same time.
SPEAKER_02: Well, if you want to make it international, Japanese people get rather small hands.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, true, but we have the soul option.
SPEAKER_02: Zoom option.
SPEAKER_02: Of course.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You can make it larger with a company.
SPEAKER_02: A greater feel to push the button.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And we won't include a pen or something to point.
SPEAKER_02: What do you have a finger?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Your fingers, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You lose a pen.
SPEAKER_02: You lose a pen.
SPEAKER_02: You lose a pen, you can't use it.
SPEAKER_03: You can't use it with a finger.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: You have to.
SPEAKER_00: They think it's handy to use pen.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think this is a good size for the screen.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know how large the external remote should be with a bit.
SPEAKER_03: And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all that.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but that can be used to put any soft tissue.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you can buy those.
SPEAKER_03: If I can interrupt you, maybe I should show some points on which we should take a decision.
SPEAKER_03: Sure.
SPEAKER_03: So we can discuss these points.
SPEAKER_03: Those points.
SPEAKER_03: Energy question mark.
SPEAKER_03: How should we supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do with separate docking station and then put accused in it?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, chip on print and case. Those are points my coach advised me to discuss here, but I hope you have ideas about them.
SPEAKER_00: I think energy or batteries and then the docking station.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, so that's the first point to include rechargeable batteries.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Which you can recharge through the docking station.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So if the batteries are dead.
SPEAKER_02: I kind of like you.
SPEAKER_02: You've got some some of those wireless mice.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Computer mouse.
SPEAKER_02: Kind of like those kind of batteries.
SPEAKER_00: But it should be, I think, normal batteries.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, normal playing.
SPEAKER_05: No, normal playing batteries.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: You can buy the supermarket or refill.
SPEAKER_03: Or be very rechargeable.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
None: Batteries.
SPEAKER_00: And what was with the chip on print?
SPEAKER_02: The chip on print.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think so.
SPEAKER_02: Chip on print with a simple, yeah, simple, but we also discard that.
SPEAKER_02: Didn't we?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but how does that work with LCD screen?
SPEAKER_03: You still have a...
SPEAKER_02: You always have a print plate.
SPEAKER_04: Thank you, Juan.
SPEAKER_04: You always have a print plate.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, sure, of course.
SPEAKER_04: Always so.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know what we have to decide about that.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, well, it's a good question.
SPEAKER_03: It was in there and I didn't have any...
SPEAKER_02: Chip on print, I think what I mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got, it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button.
SPEAKER_02: But when you got an LCD screen, Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_02: With no...
SPEAKER_02: With not...
SPEAKER_02: The buttons are not always on the same place.
SPEAKER_02: For example, if you enlarge a button, or if you got several options appearing on your screen, the code nations aren't always the same.
SPEAKER_02: When you got a regular button, the button of standby is always on the same place.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I don't know.
SPEAKER_05: And you get on the print plate of LCD screen, there's more at fault than the low print plate.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So that's not of any discussion, I think.
SPEAKER_03: No, you need some kind of CPU, I guess.
SPEAKER_03: I suppose so.
SPEAKER_02: No, I don't know.
SPEAKER_05: I don't think...
SPEAKER_02: It is a simple CPU, where it is.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_05: But I don't know if...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, because it has to...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, it's quite a simple LCD screen.
SPEAKER_05: I think they don't need that...
SPEAKER_02: The remote control has to know where you're in a settings menu, or just...
SPEAKER_02: You just want to turn on the volume.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, okay, true.
SPEAKER_05: True.
None: True.
SPEAKER_02: True.
SPEAKER_02: So it has to have some kind of...
SPEAKER_02: calculation unit on CPU, to know in which state you are, and which button you are pressing at the right moment.
SPEAKER_03: Because we're projecting the buttons on the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's a touchscreen.
SPEAKER_02: And the touchscreen makes it possible to get the coordination of your finger on screen.
SPEAKER_02: In the case, yeah, we already discussed the case, so we wanted to make it from rubber.
SPEAKER_00: But the hard rubber, like this, or softer rubber?
SPEAKER_02: The hard rubber, I think.
SPEAKER_02: That's easy to...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I'm down to the back from the floor when you...
SPEAKER_00: We have different colors.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, this is...
SPEAKER_05: The shapes is something between square shapes with round shapes.
SPEAKER_05: No, I don't think...
SPEAKER_05: It's more round than square.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's a bit longer.
SPEAKER_00: So it meets...
SPEAKER_05: I think it meets more the young people than the older people.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but that's what we wanted.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's how it started to turn into a main target.
SPEAKER_05: It's loaded for the years, I think.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know how about my idea of making it...
SPEAKER_02: with one single curve.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, yeah, that's...
SPEAKER_05: I think I thought that was quite...
SPEAKER_02: Because it's a gadget, and you want to show it off, of course.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you have a fancy design, right away.
SPEAKER_05: You can put it on your table, with LCD screen.
SPEAKER_05: You don't have to put it in your head.
SPEAKER_05: You can put it next to you, and then...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, that's good.
SPEAKER_05: It's not easy.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_02: So you write that down, and you get a single curve, rubber, fancy colored, remote control.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, you can draw it on your paper, and then...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, you can...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but I don't understand.
SPEAKER_04: And load it on the...
SPEAKER_04: the user, the server.
SPEAKER_03: About the user interface, there are also some questions.
SPEAKER_03: About the concepts, I think.
SPEAKER_03: You have some ideas.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I have what I...
SPEAKER_00: You showed you drawing.
SPEAKER_00: I should...
SPEAKER_00: Go...
SPEAKER_00: Go again.
SPEAKER_00: I miss a few buttons, but...
SPEAKER_00: At least, you should also have...
SPEAKER_00: I just remembered a menu to go back to the first...
SPEAKER_00: but if you touch options, you can go back to this right away.
SPEAKER_00: Now, the server...
SPEAKER_04: Isn't it better to have the sound and the channel buttons horizontal?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: With the minus and the plus.
SPEAKER_05: I think it's easier than...
SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: I thought it was easier to handle this way, but I don't know what they think.
SPEAKER_01: That's right.
SPEAKER_00: If you like the buttons, the horizontal vertical.
SPEAKER_02: The horizontal screen, if you make the screen vertical, it does not matter.
SPEAKER_02: If you make it in a rectangle.
SPEAKER_00: Well, if you make it like this...
SPEAKER_00: So, if you...
SPEAKER_00: Put it like this...
SPEAKER_00: Where?
SPEAKER_05: I think it's easier to have it...
SPEAKER_05: something like...
SPEAKER_05: the button minus here...
SPEAKER_05: plus over here...
SPEAKER_05: minus here...
SPEAKER_05: plus over here...
SPEAKER_05: and on here...
SPEAKER_05: the other buttons...
SPEAKER_05: and on here...
SPEAKER_05: the top...
SPEAKER_05: the options...
SPEAKER_00: But I think...
SPEAKER_05: And then you have something like the B over here...
SPEAKER_05: and the sound...
None: I think that's another one you're used to.
SPEAKER_00: I think I would put a plus in the middle here...
SPEAKER_00: and then the P in the middle and the sound...
SPEAKER_00: and then the P in the middle and the sound...
SPEAKER_00: Something like...
SPEAKER_05: Something like...
None: Shit.
SPEAKER_02: Take your time.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Plus, minus, plus...
SPEAKER_04: Oh!
SPEAKER_00: Almost.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I think when you're holding it, you could press the minus in the plus...
SPEAKER_00: and with the other finger, the minus in the plus.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, I think you're going to...
SPEAKER_05: you're going to use it with one sound.
SPEAKER_00: But I think...
SPEAKER_00: perhaps I have some...
SPEAKER_02: Will you use the build engineering there?
SPEAKER_04: Who's the usability engineering?
SPEAKER_04: She...
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to do some examples.
SPEAKER_00: Because perhaps you should choose what's most often used.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Because we can use that better.
SPEAKER_05: Consistency.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, I have that...
SPEAKER_04: those numbers.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I have...
SPEAKER_04: What good work.
SPEAKER_03: I don't really know.
SPEAKER_03: Everybody is searching in a tunnel selection.
SPEAKER_05: Per hour, 168, volume selection, four times...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but I mean if it's usually plus or minus, above each other, of next to each other, I don't know how to reload.
SPEAKER_02: Not much often is used, but...
SPEAKER_05: Oh, I thought you were doing what's on the remote.
SPEAKER_00: Looking here, but here's...
SPEAKER_00: Below, here also, you know, here's next to each other.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's...
SPEAKER_05: I think, because I have two televisions at home, one is horizontal, one is vertical.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, it doesn't really matter.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Tick-picks.
SPEAKER_00: I think the volume is usually above each other, because you go higher and down.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, lower.
SPEAKER_00: And the program is next to each other, because you go further and back.
SPEAKER_01: Hmm.
None: True.
SPEAKER_00: That's how it is usually.
SPEAKER_00: I think that's how I look here.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, let's see.
SPEAKER_02: Let's cut the chase.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, well, I think we don't have to decide about that now, how well we will put the button.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_05: It is usually at the face.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: It's confident.
SPEAKER_00: There's actually a design, you should know where you would play.
None: Okay, well...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Interface, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And the speech, shall we implement that?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, well, we just heard about the new...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, I think it's easy for that to wear, or you would then just sit down here.
SPEAKER_00: Thanks for the book.
SPEAKER_00: But then you should also find a place.
SPEAKER_00: If you do it like this, you could put it in a corner or something.
SPEAKER_00: You can talk into the corner.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, microphone.
SPEAKER_02: Not even necessary, because you can make a very sensitive microphone to make it possible to just put it around underneath it or on the bottom of it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, maybe at the bottom where you can hold it with your hands, and there's also a microphone over there.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_02: That's not important.
SPEAKER_02: I think that's not very important, because it doesn't matter where the microphone is.
SPEAKER_00: But you should decide where you are.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, I should.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: I think where it isn't seen the most,
SPEAKER_02: indeed, it shouldn't be very visible.
SPEAKER_00: You put it in a logo of the country. Yeah, shit.
SPEAKER_05: No, maybe just in between the round of the R.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, because I think it should be in an important position where people can see it, because it is the unique idea of our remote, the speech control.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Where you want to put it?
SPEAKER_03: Well, maybe it's where...
SPEAKER_02: And it doesn't make it any more fancy, because you get to see...
SPEAKER_00: It does, because you can find it better if you use it.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but...
SPEAKER_00: It's a way for you to...
SPEAKER_00: So it makes more fancy, because other remote don't have that.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: But are we talking about the button or about the microphone?
SPEAKER_03: The microphone.
SPEAKER_03: There is no button.
SPEAKER_03: I like the one. It's very small thing, but you can make it look like it's big, so it's really an important function of the remote.
SPEAKER_05: I think the left corner should be the best.
SPEAKER_05: Where it isn't...
SPEAKER_05: It isn't most inside.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
None: I think...
SPEAKER_02: Well, put it there.
SPEAKER_02: I don't mind.
SPEAKER_02: It doesn't really matter.
SPEAKER_04: No.
SPEAKER_04: Actually, does it...
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So?
SPEAKER_02: Any more...
SPEAKER_03: So, well, type...
SPEAKER_03: Supplements?
SPEAKER_02: Interface type?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, well...
SPEAKER_03: We already discussed it.
SPEAKER_03: The LCD, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Supplements...
SPEAKER_05: I think...
SPEAKER_05: Like you said, scroll...
SPEAKER_05: Next to the remote...
SPEAKER_05: Isn't that handy?
SPEAKER_05: I think it's better to just type what you'd like to do on the screen.
SPEAKER_05: If you want to go back, if a back button goes back, if you want to choose audio settings, press all your settings, and it goes to that sub menu.
SPEAKER_02: That's my name to defend.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: The young people do like this...
SPEAKER_02: You used to scroll.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So, why not?
SPEAKER_02: On...
SPEAKER_02: On-side.
SPEAKER_00: Or at least, yeah, I don't know after you scroll, but the menu aren't changed that they like most.
SPEAKER_00: And I think you can navigate through a menu with a scroll.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think you've got a settings...
SPEAKER_00: It's faster.
SPEAKER_05: I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options.
SPEAKER_05: Yes.
SPEAKER_05: But if you don't have a lot of options...
SPEAKER_05: Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_05: You have a lot of options.
SPEAKER_02: Because when you use...
SPEAKER_02: When you use the settings menu, for example, to look up some...
SPEAKER_02: Some channels on your...
SPEAKER_02: on your television.
SPEAKER_02: You should scroll down...
SPEAKER_02: on a menu, which probably does not fit on your screen.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_02: So, then it's very handy to scroll down.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: You make just a rubber just like on your mouse, or just put it on a side, and it's very easy to use.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, no problem.
SPEAKER_03: And I think it will make it even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side,
SPEAKER_00: which... It's also different.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Well, there's our five minutes...
SPEAKER_03: warning.
SPEAKER_03: Any more questions about design?
SPEAKER_03: Or do you need to face...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, components, everyone.
SPEAKER_04: Color, sword, clear...
SPEAKER_04: And what do you think?
SPEAKER_02: The material is clear.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, what's the standard color?
SPEAKER_02: The standard.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we don't...
SPEAKER_02: No, we have different color.
SPEAKER_02: How many colors do we have?
SPEAKER_02: We have different colors, but you should have a standard color.
SPEAKER_02: I think black.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, black.
SPEAKER_02: Black, I think.
SPEAKER_02: With a yellow...
SPEAKER_05: Darker, something like this.
SPEAKER_05: This color or something.
SPEAKER_02: And just a regular...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, like...
SPEAKER_02: And then have different...
SPEAKER_05: I think it's better to have silver nowadays.
SPEAKER_05: Silver, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's a few more silver...
SPEAKER_02: See a lot of silver,
SPEAKER_05: a lot of black.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, the silver, it's silver, black, our own big colors.
SPEAKER_05: I think we have silver, black, and between those...
SPEAKER_05: Like, I don't know...
SPEAKER_05: Five colors between the...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, what about a yellow thing?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's better to have yellow, you have...
SPEAKER_03: We ugly, but it's definitely fancy.
SPEAKER_02: Red.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's right.
SPEAKER_02: Green.
SPEAKER_02: With silver.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Rubber...
SPEAKER_02: Silver rubber isn't fancy.
SPEAKER_04: True?
SPEAKER_02: When you use titanium, silver is fancy, but when you use silver rubber, it's fancy.
SPEAKER_02: Silver has to shine, and rubber doesn't shine.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Especially when you just made a soft rubber like this.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You understand?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I understand.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I would think about colors like red, yellow, blue,
SPEAKER_05: yeah, of course, the fruity colors. And the autumn colors, like red and brown.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, dark red and brown, maroon.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so...
SPEAKER_00: And do I have to have a normal black one or...
SPEAKER_03: Who's it?
SPEAKER_03: Pinking.
SPEAKER_03: No, I don't think.
SPEAKER_03: Pinking.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so that wraps it up.
SPEAKER_03: Everybody knows what to do.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I don't know what to do.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what to do.
SPEAKER_01: I would have done what to do.
SPEAKER_03: The next meeting is once again in 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_03: Here are the individual actions, and especially notice that the industrial design and usually the interfaces are going to work together on a prototype, a smart board, and of course, to all four of us specific instructions will be emailed by a personal coach.
SPEAKER_00: We'll work together, but do we have to stay here or do we?
SPEAKER_03: Well, I'd say just wait for an email and find out.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I think we should work.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, well, that was what I had to say.
SPEAKER_03: Final thoughts from anyone or...
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, well, thank you very much.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: How finished?
SPEAKER_00: Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_00: So, I was thinking, I'm finished now.
None: I think I'll just wait for the things or the emails to get.
None: I'll make a new one for you.
None: Thanks.
None: All right, face out.
None: Bye.
None: Okay, well, I'll try to put the minutes in the project folder as soon as possible.
None: Okay.
None: Hopefully, faster this time.
None: Okay, good luck.
None: Well, everything is clear.
None: Is that here?
None: Here, for fun.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, this is a smart board.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
