None: You got a 10 from all the way.
None: They put some.
None: You got a 10.
None: You became brown on your own.
None: You don't say you became brown.
None: Well, that's not as a matter of speak.
SPEAKER_02: They put some stress out.
SPEAKER_02: I'm just relaxing.
None: You're going to stress out now.
None: So I'm going to...
None: Because?
None: We have to do some extra design.
None: You'll see.
SPEAKER_02: You'll see.
SPEAKER_02: Fourth meeting.
None: You have to do what?
SPEAKER_03: Extra deciding.
SPEAKER_03: What?
SPEAKER_01: Well, we'll see.
SPEAKER_02: I'll show you the notes again.
SPEAKER_02: Very interesting.
SPEAKER_02: Well, you two will present us your prototype.
SPEAKER_02: Then I guess that's your bit.
SPEAKER_02: I didn't see anything about it.
SPEAKER_02: I thought you would do that.
SPEAKER_02: Then you were a telescope.
SPEAKER_02: I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this design.
SPEAKER_01: That's important too.
SPEAKER_02: We'll evaluate after we have redesigned it.
SPEAKER_02: We'll see about the costs.
SPEAKER_02: We'll evaluate our production.
SPEAKER_02: Then we can close.
None: All right.
SPEAKER_02: Well, the finance world of later.
SPEAKER_02: So, firstly, I'll show you the notes.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think it's very interesting.
SPEAKER_04: I think it is.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, nay.
SPEAKER_02: I'd never...
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: This is copy-paste.
SPEAKER_02: For me, of course.
SPEAKER_01: Of course.
SPEAKER_01: It's a very strange layout.
SPEAKER_01: It's a nice course.
SPEAKER_02: Well, we went to the agenda.
SPEAKER_02: Well, we had some presentations from you, tree.
SPEAKER_02: I summarized what you said to us.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think it's very interesting to go to it again.
SPEAKER_02: Repeat it.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: This is what we decided.
SPEAKER_02: It's also copy-paste from what we made together.
SPEAKER_02: We still know that.
SPEAKER_02: Then we can use the time better.
SPEAKER_02: Well, next, you two will present the prototype for us.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: We both will.
SPEAKER_04: Or one as well.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: So, make mistakes.
SPEAKER_01: Well, this is our design.
SPEAKER_01: It's pretty much like a mic draw drew during the last meeting.
SPEAKER_01: With the different perspectives of it, we will begin with the front.
SPEAKER_01: We have, of course, the round shape, the round basic shape, with the upper part being the front.
SPEAKER_01: So, this part, which is made of hard plastic, the front.
SPEAKER_01: And we're using different colors.
SPEAKER_01: Of course, for the launch, we use the basic ugly colors.
SPEAKER_01: Later, we'll put out more interesting colors with different patterns and pictures and everything.
SPEAKER_01: But basically different colors.
SPEAKER_01: White colors, not black, too dark, fancy color.
SPEAKER_01: Then we have the lower part of the device, which is, of course, part of the back, actually, because it's also titanium.
SPEAKER_01: You see it also on the side view that only this part is the front.
SPEAKER_01: And the rest of it, the underside of it, the back side.
SPEAKER_01: And the lower part of the front is, of course, titanium, made of titanium, and has the titanium color, of course, the look.
SPEAKER_01: Then we have, on the back of the front, the logo in the upper corner, which is also part of the back, part of the titanium, titanium part.
SPEAKER_01: It's a double R.
SPEAKER_04: It's a double R.
SPEAKER_01: It's a double R, yeah, the logo, it's a difficult to draw, so small, but it's our double R.
SPEAKER_01: The logo is in there.
SPEAKER_01: So, that's the logo in the upper left right corner.
SPEAKER_01: And we have the buttons.
SPEAKER_01: It's difficult to draw again.
SPEAKER_01: The little oval around, I think, oval will be better for the...
SPEAKER_01: For the...
SPEAKER_01: For the...
SPEAKER_01: Different channel buttons.
SPEAKER_01: So, they're all oval, those are here, and then we have the...
SPEAKER_01: The channel up and volume.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the volume and the channel controls in the middle here.
SPEAKER_01: With kind of arrow shapes, it makes it also a bit more exciting and basic.
SPEAKER_01: Round or square buttons.
SPEAKER_01: And then also here are the two buttons we agreed on.
SPEAKER_01: We have the OK button.
SPEAKER_01: The OK button is here in the middle of the...
SPEAKER_01: Of the channel and volume changes.
SPEAKER_01: And then we have here the menu button and the...
SPEAKER_04: All right, menu for the...
SPEAKER_01: And the video button.
SPEAKER_01: Right, so...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And of course, this is the low part, this is the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_00: OK.
SPEAKER_01: This is what we made of it.
SPEAKER_01: You can make suggestions if you want.
SPEAKER_02: If I look at it, decide.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe we should finish first our talk and then you can add to the...
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what to do.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I don't want to express you, but I'll finish this quick.
SPEAKER_01: Go now.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, I've had everything, I guess, on the back.
SPEAKER_01: On the back, with the...
SPEAKER_04: On the back, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: We thought about, yeah, the back is, of course, totally titanium.
SPEAKER_01: And we thought about the logo big in the middle.
SPEAKER_01: So, again, the double R.
SPEAKER_01: We had then the logo on front and on the back.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe that's too much, but you have to say it if you think that way.
SPEAKER_01: And the company slogan, we thought in a kind of arc shape above the logo.
SPEAKER_01: That's basically what we were thinking about.
SPEAKER_04: And about the side view.
SPEAKER_04: This, the front won't be as thick, but again...
SPEAKER_04: That drawing technique makes it very difficult to...
SPEAKER_01: Oh, and before I forget, the voice recording is at the bottom.
SPEAKER_01: You can record it using a backup bar.
SPEAKER_02: When I look at this side view, I think when I have that in my hand, it's terrible.
SPEAKER_02: If you look, if this is thick, and this is thin, it's nice over your hand.
SPEAKER_02: It fits the hand.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, I agree.
SPEAKER_02: What I agree is that when you have such an arc in the middle, so that the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker.
SPEAKER_02: So, then it falls over your hands.
SPEAKER_04: If your handle will remote, you usually don't have your hand straight in the middle.
SPEAKER_03: In the middle, you have it a bit.
SPEAKER_03: It depends on the size.
SPEAKER_03: If it's kind of small, this is great, but if it's larger, then you want to grab it.
SPEAKER_03: How large is it?
SPEAKER_03: That's the question.
SPEAKER_03: That's the question.
SPEAKER_01: Well, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: What do you suggest, Andy?
SPEAKER_01: It was Mike's prototype, and you seem to agree on it.
SPEAKER_02: Well, the size, I haven't seen yet.
SPEAKER_02: The size, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Well, the size doesn't really matter.
SPEAKER_01: The size.
SPEAKER_00: The size.
SPEAKER_01: The size.
SPEAKER_01: He drew the size.
SPEAKER_01: You weren't paying attention, as usual.
SPEAKER_01: Well, in any case, we'll discuss it now.
SPEAKER_01: I think this is a pretty good idea.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I agree with the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_03: You have it in your palm like this, and you can watch the screen.
SPEAKER_03: And if you have it in the middle, your hand might be over it.
SPEAKER_01: But you hold it like this.
SPEAKER_01: You're not holding it like this, but something.
SPEAKER_04: You're doing grab it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, how do you call it then?
SPEAKER_01: Well, you don't have it like this.
SPEAKER_01: You have it more like this.
SPEAKER_01: So you're using buttons this way, or like you're writing it.
SPEAKER_03: So you have a screen on it.
SPEAKER_03: You want to look at your screen.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, well, it falls into your hand, I think.
SPEAKER_01: And maybe you can grab it a bit higher.
SPEAKER_03: No, I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01: That's the reason to put the LCD screen, of course, on the upside.
SPEAKER_04: Well, as far as I can see, three of us agree.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, well, I think if you agree, then that's it.
SPEAKER_04: You're the project manager.
SPEAKER_04: You can make the hard decision.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: But can you leave it like this?
SPEAKER_02: All right, if you think that that's the way you should.
SPEAKER_01: You said it was totally unuseable.
SPEAKER_02: No, but do you?
SPEAKER_02: No, when I, my personal taste is that I wanted to fall over my hands with a thick...
SPEAKER_01: But you don't think this is completely unuseable, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: I think not totally.
SPEAKER_02: Not totally.
SPEAKER_02: For me, I wouldn't buy it.
SPEAKER_01: Of course, you are also human.
SPEAKER_01: We have to take every one into account.
SPEAKER_03: You might be a target customer.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Who else thinks like you?
SPEAKER_01: We don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe you're a thousand people.
SPEAKER_02: But that's more market research.
SPEAKER_02: So let it be like this at the latest moment.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so that's that and you're the suggestions.
SPEAKER_02: No, I think it's great.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: But what about the redesigning?
SPEAKER_02: Comes to that later.
SPEAKER_02: You.
SPEAKER_02: You can do it.
SPEAKER_02: Wow, that's wonderful.
SPEAKER_01: You're very pretty.
SPEAKER_02: You can do the evaluation criteria on this.
SPEAKER_02: All right, great.
SPEAKER_02: That's more useful.
SPEAKER_02: Then just speaking.
SPEAKER_03: Well, this is just a short intro.
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to do the evaluation.
SPEAKER_03: This is going to be done at the end of seven point skill criteria.
SPEAKER_03: So I made a few questions on the hand of the most important requirements and trends and we have to look if our if our device is working correctly.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I put some questions in a word file.
SPEAKER_03: See if I can find them.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, I think you have all seen this kind of evaluation.
SPEAKER_03: So I don't have to explain it.
SPEAKER_03: The first question is, is the device good looking?
SPEAKER_03: Because most people thought that earlier the devices were ugly, ugly.
SPEAKER_03: 75% of them.
SPEAKER_03: So what do we think?
SPEAKER_01: Well, we designed it.
SPEAKER_01: So of course, we are very.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we're not quite objective about that.
SPEAKER_02: No, but we need to be.
SPEAKER_03: We have to evaluate it.
SPEAKER_03: So I have to take this questionnaire.
SPEAKER_03: So we have to answer now.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we're changing the question.
SPEAKER_02: You have to take this questionnaire.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but I can.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_02: But well, we can go because of the time.
SPEAKER_02: Pretty quick through this.
SPEAKER_02: Do we find it good looking?
SPEAKER_02: Well, we think so.
SPEAKER_03: I think you know, we designed it to be perfect.
SPEAKER_03: So, but we have to be critical about it.
SPEAKER_03: And I have to take all these points and get an average at the end.
SPEAKER_03: So we know where we stand.
SPEAKER_03: One.
SPEAKER_03: Because there are some things we might have forgotten.
SPEAKER_02: Well, so it's point four.
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_03: So let's start with the beginning.
SPEAKER_03: Just one one.
SPEAKER_03: Is it good looking?
SPEAKER_01: Well, I guess I think it's it's it's pointed towards the youth of course.
SPEAKER_01: If you look at the design and the colors and everything, it was our target audience of course, but it's also not completely unacceptable for all the people, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: It's not the type any it might be.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's for all the people.
SPEAKER_01: It's more that classic.
SPEAKER_03: You put the black front on it or something.
SPEAKER_01: No, I think yeah, they like black, of course, but I think they'll they think the titanium look of it is also.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's also good for them.
SPEAKER_01: So I think we both consider consider it.
SPEAKER_01: We consider it the youth and also a bit all the people.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: It's very good looking and not only for youth young people.
SPEAKER_04: I think we shouldn't discuss any points that long.
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_04: No, how many points there are about that?
SPEAKER_02: I told you the 40.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: A number please.
SPEAKER_02: Get on.
SPEAKER_01: Is it easy to change channels?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, well, I think so.
SPEAKER_03: So the last one is seven.
SPEAKER_02: Easy to change channels.
SPEAKER_02: No, it's not false.
SPEAKER_02: It's one.
SPEAKER_03: Sorry.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, right.
None: Well, two.
SPEAKER_02: Ten channels.
SPEAKER_02: Well, we have to go to it.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's as easy as can be made.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: So I, yeah, how can you make it any easier?
SPEAKER_03: The power channel and volume buttons are easy accessible.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you would use it.
SPEAKER_03: Two.
SPEAKER_03: Two.
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_03: The device is easy to find if you lose it.
SPEAKER_02: No, we don't have anything about that.
SPEAKER_04: We don't have that.
SPEAKER_04: It's easier to find than a normal black one on something.
SPEAKER_04: Of course, we call it.
SPEAKER_04: Well, six.
SPEAKER_01: Six.
SPEAKER_01: Well, we don't have to devise that beep so when you lost it at all.
SPEAKER_02: Functions easy to learn.
SPEAKER_02: Well, we do want to have a...
SPEAKER_02: You have so few films.
SPEAKER_02: Less one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I agree.
SPEAKER_02: And the device are as I sensitive.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I feel too.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Because the voice recorded.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Self learning.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: All right.
SPEAKER_02: Two.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but just do something.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We need...
SPEAKER_02: Are we taking too much time?
SPEAKER_02: I think this is two time consuming.
SPEAKER_02: Not two.
SPEAKER_02: I agree.
SPEAKER_02: Not two words.
SPEAKER_02: This is how you have to put this to the customers.
SPEAKER_03: Erase sensitive.
SPEAKER_02: Well, a little bit.
SPEAKER_02: So four.
SPEAKER_03: Four.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, very much.
SPEAKER_02: One.
SPEAKER_02: One and features included.
SPEAKER_02: Also one.
SPEAKER_02: And.
SPEAKER_02: Well, those nine is defensive looking.
SPEAKER_02: We still think so.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Device fence.
SPEAKER_02: And they think fence shooting too because of the titanium back.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: Other enough technology.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Well, also we have two.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's great.
SPEAKER_02: Is the device easy to use?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, we have not many buttons.
SPEAKER_01: So we have maybe two.
SPEAKER_01: Wow.
SPEAKER_02: So the voice recording.
SPEAKER_02: Three.
SPEAKER_02: Are the trends about fruit, in fact, the most implemented well in our coffers, in our fronts.
SPEAKER_02: So yes, one.
SPEAKER_02: One or two.
SPEAKER_03: Is the material extra to four, I think.
SPEAKER_03: If you look at this.
SPEAKER_01: Well, it doesn't really resemble any fruit.
SPEAKER_01: That's true.
SPEAKER_01: But we have the...
SPEAKER_01: Ah, fruit colors, of course.
SPEAKER_01: And you can also have a front with the fruit.
SPEAKER_03: It's the fruit that is very attractive.
SPEAKER_02: Well, the titanium is strong and the rest...
SPEAKER_02: The buttons feel soft, so I would say at least two.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: This is the last meeting.
SPEAKER_04: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: But we have to design much more.
SPEAKER_02: Because there was some irritating account manager coming to me.
SPEAKER_01: I knew things were going smoothly.
SPEAKER_01: It had to be some kind of trouble, a long way.
SPEAKER_02: Well, look at the costs at this point.
SPEAKER_02: My God, I had to fill it in.
SPEAKER_02: It was to go through 12, right?
SPEAKER_02: 12 and a half.
SPEAKER_02: 12 and a half.
SPEAKER_02: So, well, what costs a lot?
SPEAKER_02: The sample speaker costs four.
SPEAKER_02: What?
SPEAKER_02: The sample speaker.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, that's easy.
SPEAKER_03: Kick it out.
SPEAKER_02: Kick it out.
SPEAKER_02: We have to go to 12 and a half.
SPEAKER_02: The speaker costs fair by far the most.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's a bit an optional option.
SPEAKER_02: It isn't worth.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: We could make two different versions, one with and one without.
SPEAKER_02: It's just extra.
SPEAKER_02: Kick it out.
SPEAKER_02: So, zero.
SPEAKER_02: Then we go to 14.6.
SPEAKER_02: But more.
SPEAKER_02: Well, the titanium I don't want to lose, actually.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: LC3.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, hand dynamo.
SPEAKER_02: Come on.
SPEAKER_01: The remote control has a battery.
SPEAKER_01: Well, we have a bit of a problem, I think.
SPEAKER_04: Why should we use an advanced chip?
SPEAKER_04: Well, we've already had the LC3.
SPEAKER_04: You had said.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Come to do it with a regular chip.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: Why not?
SPEAKER_01: Because that...
SPEAKER_01: No, because...
SPEAKER_01: What's the difference between a simple regular?
SPEAKER_02: What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip?
SPEAKER_02: A regular chip.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: A simple?
SPEAKER_01: A simple.
SPEAKER_01: Well, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I read something about it, but...
SPEAKER_01: Elementary.
SPEAKER_02: Well, ties.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I read something about it, but it wasn't very clear.
SPEAKER_01: I didn't include it in my report.
SPEAKER_02: What happens if we do single...
SPEAKER_01: Well, you have to use...
SPEAKER_01: A chip, so...
SPEAKER_01: Well, you have to use the advanced chip one.
SPEAKER_01: We have to use the advanced chip one.
SPEAKER_01: If you have the LC3.
SPEAKER_04: We have very little options for the more.
SPEAKER_04: But if you have a regular chip, you can't have the LC3.
SPEAKER_01: Well, we have to put the...
SPEAKER_03: No, we need to have the...
SPEAKER_02: Well, we could say...
SPEAKER_02: Well, this special color...
SPEAKER_02: That isn't there, because the fronts...
SPEAKER_02: They will buy it.
SPEAKER_02: This special color.
SPEAKER_02: But that's only one half.
SPEAKER_03: It doesn't...
SPEAKER_03: Not relevant.
SPEAKER_02: Then you only have one half left.
SPEAKER_04: You must use the chip back in this.
SPEAKER_01: But then we have to lose the LC3.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: Then the whole concept is...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I know.
SPEAKER_01: That's what my information is.
SPEAKER_01: I didn't put the advanced chip in there for fun.
SPEAKER_03: You can make a chip, but if you don't sell...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: We have an advanced chip on print, and we have an LC3.
SPEAKER_04: I think that's a bit double.
SPEAKER_04: You don't need both.
SPEAKER_02: The advanced chip is needed to have the LC3 in this play.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Says his...
SPEAKER_02: There was in the second meeting, I think.
SPEAKER_02: Well, what do they mean with curves?
SPEAKER_01: Again, because you have...
SPEAKER_02: I did single curves to...
SPEAKER_02: Well, you said double curved.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: He...
SPEAKER_02: Because I thought it's a bit cheaper already.
SPEAKER_01: We can also make it flat.
SPEAKER_01: What do they mean with curves?
SPEAKER_01: Is this curved?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, this curved?
SPEAKER_01: One curved.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, this is actually two curved.
SPEAKER_01: No, it's how you look at it.
SPEAKER_01: One curved.
SPEAKER_01: Simple.
SPEAKER_01: But then we have a huge problem, I think.
SPEAKER_01: We can never get below that...
SPEAKER_02: We have a big financial problem.
SPEAKER_04: We make it more expensive to buy.
SPEAKER_02: Well, then we have two dollars less profit.
SPEAKER_02: Come on.
SPEAKER_02: If we make this 50 million, they won't test it to congratulate us.
SPEAKER_03: If I make people brand-aware, they are willing to pay more.
SPEAKER_03: But...
SPEAKER_03: Because we use a brand at the front and at the back.
SPEAKER_03: If you have lots of marketing, people might buy.
SPEAKER_04: Or we could...
SPEAKER_02: If you make it cool to have.
SPEAKER_02: By the way, we also have this one.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, that's just great.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, cost nothing.
SPEAKER_02: Oh.
SPEAKER_02: That's nice.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_01: I think you'll agree that we...
SPEAKER_01: Now we have this screen.
SPEAKER_01: It's very not practical to consider this after we have designed the entire thing.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, but I just got it.
SPEAKER_00: Well, that's pretty...
SPEAKER_00: That is pretty stupid.
SPEAKER_04: That's pretty practical.
SPEAKER_04: Well, Colant, titanium.
SPEAKER_04: Who?
SPEAKER_04: Titanium, Colant, plastic.
SPEAKER_02: You want to jump to titanium?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, well, if we...
SPEAKER_04: We have to get cheaper.
SPEAKER_02: And make all plastic.
SPEAKER_02: Then we're there.
SPEAKER_01: But I don't agree.
SPEAKER_04: I think we've got to...
SPEAKER_02: If you look at the ugly...
SPEAKER_02: The yellowish...
SPEAKER_02: The ugly looking dumb...
SPEAKER_02: We won't.
SPEAKER_02: That no one would buy.
SPEAKER_04: It's not ugly looking.
SPEAKER_04: The looks remain the same.
SPEAKER_04: No, I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01: I think the titanium just provided the tough look and the...
SPEAKER_02: And the feel and the fact that it is strong.
SPEAKER_01: And also the older people will like it because of that.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Because it's not our target audience, but it's useful.
SPEAKER_01: We still...
SPEAKER_02: We have to put it to get more people from younger group, but not lose the one.
SPEAKER_01: I think that the titanium is very important.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, all right.
SPEAKER_04: But then we...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we have a problem.
SPEAKER_01: But you can better dump the LCD screen now.
SPEAKER_04: You can dump the special color.
SPEAKER_04: We use plastic.
SPEAKER_04: The plastic is already in color.
SPEAKER_03: I don't think you should dump the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_01: Well, what else?
SPEAKER_01: Nothing.
SPEAKER_03: Or you should...
SPEAKER_03: Or change the titanium or dump the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_03: I think you could better change titanium to a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Then lose the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_03: Because you have lots of functions in it too.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, well, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Why can't I agree with that?
SPEAKER_01: So we use...
SPEAKER_01: Unfortunately.
SPEAKER_02: I'll put it in the report.
SPEAKER_02: Titanium Colored Plastic.
SPEAKER_02: Titanium Colored Plastic.
SPEAKER_02: Titanium Colored Plastic.
SPEAKER_02: Titanium Colored Plastic.
SPEAKER_02: Titanium Colored Plastic.
SPEAKER_02: Titanium Colored Plastic.
SPEAKER_02: Titanium Colored Plastic.
SPEAKER_01: I agree.
SPEAKER_01: So, titanium or colored plastic for the back?
SPEAKER_02: I'll talk to the managers.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_04: Titanium stays there.
SPEAKER_04: Titanium, I think.
SPEAKER_04: I think this is...
SPEAKER_02: This is...
SPEAKER_02: This is...
SPEAKER_02: This is really good.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, this is good.
SPEAKER_01: But it's not bad enough.
SPEAKER_01: So we have to use the...
SPEAKER_01: ditch the titanium, I'm afraid.
SPEAKER_01: Ah, those...
SPEAKER_01: Those account managers.
SPEAKER_02: What do they know?
SPEAKER_02: Come on.
SPEAKER_02: What do we know?
SPEAKER_02: What do we know?
SPEAKER_02: All we want is a fancy design.
SPEAKER_01: But we don't really have to...
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_04: No, because we didn't know anything about it.
SPEAKER_04: If you don't have to make it,
SPEAKER_03: we have to deal with it now. If you don't have the money, you can't make it.
SPEAKER_03: So, this is too expensive.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_01: So, we have to make it cheaper.
SPEAKER_01: Titanium gone and add plastic.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but then we've got money...
SPEAKER_01: An on plastic times two and then we are there.
SPEAKER_01: Well, no, it's just on all plastic.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_01: Right, right, not yet.
SPEAKER_01: That's a ghost niggas.
SPEAKER_01: A lot of plastic, eh?
SPEAKER_01: It's just free money.
SPEAKER_01: So, now two for the two make it clear.
SPEAKER_02: But then we can add the special color.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Because we have money left.
SPEAKER_02: And we still have money left.
SPEAKER_02: What do we want, guys?
SPEAKER_01: I want gold plating.
SPEAKER_01: No, not the head.
SPEAKER_01: I want chrome.
SPEAKER_04: Well, I think the case is double-curved, eh?
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: We have to...
SPEAKER_00: Oh, no!
SPEAKER_00: All right.
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, but that's safe.
SPEAKER_01: Well, you can double-curve if you don't have titanium.
SPEAKER_01: And that we dropped.
SPEAKER_01: So, it can be done.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: But it's pretty funny.
SPEAKER_01: We do want to reach 12.5.
SPEAKER_01: But it's not too...
SPEAKER_01: It's not too stale.
SPEAKER_01: It's 11.
SPEAKER_04: It's not too stale, but it looks like it.
SPEAKER_01: Well, we get our salaries, we make it nice.
SPEAKER_02: We have to jump out of titanium.
SPEAKER_02: And we'll hate the managers for that.
SPEAKER_02: But now we're going to object...
SPEAKER_02: We evaluate our project.
SPEAKER_02: Project.
SPEAKER_02: Project.
SPEAKER_02: Well, satisfaction only for example, are we satisfactory about our creativity?
SPEAKER_01: Well, I can get no satisfaction, but, eh...
SPEAKER_01: I think it's, eh...
SPEAKER_01: Well, and if we consider the cost, then this is the best, can.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's terrible that we got those costs at the last moment.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, me too.
SPEAKER_02: That's really bad.
SPEAKER_02: That's ridiculous.
SPEAKER_01: That's...
SPEAKER_02: That's...
SPEAKER_02: But also for our creativity, we have a nice design.
SPEAKER_02: And then you get the cost and you have to dump all your creativity.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, right.
SPEAKER_04: We use our creativity, but we just have to adapt it to the cost.
SPEAKER_04: Which is very practical, but...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's the way...
SPEAKER_02: Well, all right.
SPEAKER_02: Leadership.
SPEAKER_02: Terrible.
SPEAKER_02: Teamwork.
SPEAKER_02: Leadership.
SPEAKER_03: Well, it's...
SPEAKER_03: It was very democratic.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, well, I think so, so.
SPEAKER_02: I feel that they need the questionaries each time, so...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Well, the managers were terrible.
SPEAKER_02: So, with their all-door, useless requirements, but, all right.
SPEAKER_02: Our teamwork.
SPEAKER_01: They didn't think of the requirements.
SPEAKER_01: It's the requirements of the user, I guess.
SPEAKER_02: Now, they said, oh, we won't...
SPEAKER_02: We won't...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We'll stay the text.
SPEAKER_02: We won't use the DVD.
SPEAKER_01: Now, but they base that on...
SPEAKER_01: And user specifications.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: Teamwork.
SPEAKER_02: Well, great, I think.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Thanks for the...
SPEAKER_02: Well, what do you think about the smartboard?
SPEAKER_01: It was a complete disaster.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I like it.
SPEAKER_01: That's a smartboard.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And that's a digital pen.
SPEAKER_04: It's also a smartboard.
SPEAKER_01: Now, it's part of a way around.
SPEAKER_01: That's the smartboard.
SPEAKER_02: I like this smartboard, but I hated that one.
SPEAKER_02: This isn't a smartboard.
SPEAKER_02: Well, it's both a smartboard.
SPEAKER_03: That's a smartboard.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, all right.
SPEAKER_03: But you...
SPEAKER_00: Oh, there's a large...
SPEAKER_03: Large television.
SPEAKER_02: You used a smartboard.
SPEAKER_02: It's both a smartboard, but this one is used for a desktop.
SPEAKER_02: And that one is used to draw.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but you can...
SPEAKER_03: This is just a Bimmer function.
SPEAKER_03: And here, on this one, you can draw pictures and things together.
SPEAKER_02: Well, which one did you like?
SPEAKER_02: That one.
SPEAKER_02: Left or right?
SPEAKER_02: That one.
SPEAKER_03: That one is...
SPEAKER_03: Actually, it just doesn't work.
SPEAKER_04: I think this is meant by the digital pen.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: That is, so.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think that's a big smartboard.
SPEAKER_03: I think that's a big smartboard.
SPEAKER_03: I don't need a smartboard.
SPEAKER_04: No, it's a smartboard.
SPEAKER_04: No, well.
SPEAKER_04: We use that one.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but we need it.
SPEAKER_03: It gives me a Bimmer.
SPEAKER_03: That's a smartboard.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, much cheaper.
SPEAKER_02: It's all left up to a Bimmer or have this one standing here in a...
SPEAKER_02: I like it.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I like it.
SPEAKER_04: I like it.
SPEAKER_01: But you can...
SPEAKER_01: I said it about three times now.
SPEAKER_01: A green board with chalk is much more useful than that.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it is.
SPEAKER_02: The simple school board.
SPEAKER_02: And the digital pen.
SPEAKER_02: Did you like that one?
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: I didn't use it.
SPEAKER_01: I wrote things down, but I didn't...
SPEAKER_01: I used it to check it out.
SPEAKER_02: You just need to check it out.
SPEAKER_02: But...
SPEAKER_02: You can send that to anyone.
SPEAKER_00: Because you just need to travel something on a page for yourself.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: And then you're going to send it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, well.
SPEAKER_01: And then also, you write things now.
SPEAKER_01: And you can also bring your note block.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: What's the...
SPEAKER_01: What's the point of importing it into?
SPEAKER_04: I drew this.
SPEAKER_04: I made a mistake, but it...
SPEAKER_04: It would have been useful if I could show this on the screen.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, all right.
SPEAKER_01: For drawing.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, for drawing.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, for drawing.
SPEAKER_01: Not for personal notes, right?
SPEAKER_04: I think that's not very...
SPEAKER_04: Notes.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, you can bring your paper work along.
SPEAKER_01: Well, of course, if you have a lot of paper drawings...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I agree on that.
SPEAKER_02: But for notes, you have to put that in a strict...
SPEAKER_02: You have to put in names, then the date.
SPEAKER_02: And all those things, notes for a meeting are very strict.
SPEAKER_02: So if you would write them down for yourself and then put that in your computer...
SPEAKER_02: You still have to type it over to words.
SPEAKER_02: So it doesn't have any...
SPEAKER_02: Does that matter?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I understand.
SPEAKER_01: But I think this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paper work.
SPEAKER_01: It's not very...
SPEAKER_01: No, I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01: A lot of documents are...
SPEAKER_03: It's only useful if you have to draw something.
SPEAKER_04: But then it's really useful, I think.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, right.
SPEAKER_02: Etc. Well, the laptops.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, great.
SPEAKER_02: Of course, great.
SPEAKER_02: Can we keep them?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you can.
SPEAKER_02: Bye, my man.
SPEAKER_02: Bye, let's go.
SPEAKER_02: It's positive, manager.
SPEAKER_02: Other things we used here...
SPEAKER_02: I hated the cameras.
SPEAKER_02: I hated the microphones.
SPEAKER_02: Well, they might hear us.
SPEAKER_03: Well, did you really...
SPEAKER_01: Really great.
SPEAKER_01: Did you really take those in account?
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: F of time, I didn't notice they were there.
SPEAKER_02: I haven't looked one time directly at the camera.
SPEAKER_02: I don't care about it.
SPEAKER_01: But we shouldn't talk about it.
SPEAKER_01: Because...
SPEAKER_01: Well, we're in this environment.
SPEAKER_02: Etc.
SPEAKER_02: We can...
SPEAKER_02: Etc.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: New ideas found.
SPEAKER_02: What kind of ideas for future schedule we have with?
SPEAKER_02: For future meetings you've got.
SPEAKER_04: You missed the option to communicate to email between...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, email.
SPEAKER_01: Shit, yeah, email.
SPEAKER_01: Well, that's just environment.
SPEAKER_01: They set us up with...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, all right.
SPEAKER_04: But that's one new idea.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Well, new ideas found by this.
SPEAKER_02: Not.
SPEAKER_02: Nothing.
SPEAKER_02: Well, we don't want information in the beginning.
SPEAKER_02: We hate this.
SPEAKER_02: That's...
SPEAKER_02: Digital pen is useless.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, we don't.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we don't want it.
SPEAKER_01: We're all for drawing.
SPEAKER_02: We're drawing, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So it is useless.
SPEAKER_02: But, uh, two...
SPEAKER_02: But, uh, then you have to have a lot of drawing.
SPEAKER_02: Because, well, I had a company and I'm going to, uh, buy those expensive, huge, expensive things.
SPEAKER_02: And I have to pay those papers that are expensive.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not going to wear.
SPEAKER_03: For people who sketched the old day, I can imagine that it's...
SPEAKER_02: Well, they still have a nice graphics program on the laptop.
SPEAKER_02: Because this is huge.
SPEAKER_04: Well, you can draw on a laptop like you paint or draw with your hand.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I agree.
SPEAKER_03: But if you...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Well, life just isn't working if you're sketching.
SPEAKER_01: Indeed.
SPEAKER_01: But, what if, uh, maybe this board, uh, a smart board is malfunctioning or something, but suppose it was working correctly.
SPEAKER_01: Would it be useful then?
SPEAKER_01: If it wasn't off all the time.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, no.
SPEAKER_02: I hate it to draw like that.
SPEAKER_02: You can draw anything neat.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but he's saying if it is correct, and you can draw very...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, if it's a life,
SPEAKER_02: it would be perfect following. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Wow.
SPEAKER_02: But maybe that thing is...
SPEAKER_02: It's very expensive towards a just a green board.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but then you can save it instantly.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's used for.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: If it works correctly, maybe this thing is just malfunctioning.
SPEAKER_01: If you get another one and you make sure it does work, I think then it's pretty useful.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Because, yeah, you can draw things quickly and clearly for anyone in the discussion room.
SPEAKER_01: And then you can save it immediately.
SPEAKER_02: Well, they are now...
SPEAKER_02: Hmm.
SPEAKER_03: Celebration.
SPEAKER_02: It is.
SPEAKER_02: So.
SPEAKER_02: Did you tell me...
SPEAKER_02: Congratulations.
SPEAKER_02: True.
SPEAKER_02: Celebration.
SPEAKER_04: Well, we didn't go to the bar.
SPEAKER_04: Finally, maybe we earned money.
SPEAKER_02: Well, that's it.
SPEAKER_02: I think I don't know how long we still have...
SPEAKER_02: I don't know how long we had for this last meeting.
SPEAKER_01: But maybe till four o'clock or something?
SPEAKER_01: Well, I do not know.
SPEAKER_02: Well, yeah, this is a bit...
SPEAKER_02: Well, we still have to make the entry port and all those things.
SPEAKER_02: I have to do that.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You better get started.
SPEAKER_02: Did you save this one in the folder?
SPEAKER_02: Can you do that?
SPEAKER_01: Well, we must save this thing in the shared map.
SPEAKER_04: But, Neil, you have got some work left.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know what you would have to do.
SPEAKER_02: It's a good word to do the folder.
SPEAKER_04: You don't have to go to a PCO TFT.
SPEAKER_02: Well, it worked.
SPEAKER_02: Two times quick.
SPEAKER_02: So, it is usual.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, great, man.
SPEAKER_00: This is nice.
SPEAKER_03: Bicycle.
SPEAKER_04: It's a battery.
SPEAKER_04: I want to conquer that stuff.
SPEAKER_02: Design.
SPEAKER_01: Do you believe it yourself?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, he saved them all ten.
SPEAKER_02: Well, all right.
SPEAKER_04: Well, they wondered everything we produced.
SPEAKER_01: They also want to see my cat and his rabbit.
SPEAKER_04: Well, my big bird.
SPEAKER_01: You're a big, beautiful bird.
SPEAKER_02: Where is this?
SPEAKER_01: Maybe the pen is just broken and the board isn't.
SPEAKER_01: Or the other way around them.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe you are broken.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think.
SPEAKER_01: So, too.
SPEAKER_04: You think you have to make clear to her that way or where?
SPEAKER_03: I think she's listening.
SPEAKER_03: He also.
SPEAKER_02: She always knows she's talking about.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, you mean our big brother?
SPEAKER_01: Our coach, our personal coach.
SPEAKER_01: Our manager.
SPEAKER_01: She also our accountant.
SPEAKER_01: Is she responsible for sending that information to the lathe?
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01: Because then we have to confront her with our...
SPEAKER_01: So, as you can see, we're ready.
SPEAKER_03: I feel what.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: We put the passion actually in the mode into...
SPEAKER_02: What we could have because of the cost.
SPEAKER_02: That's our new environment.
SPEAKER_02: I like who didn't put the passion into the electronics.
SPEAKER_03: Play our accountant.
SPEAKER_02: Do that.
SPEAKER_02: That's a nice title.
SPEAKER_03: But we couldn't.
SPEAKER_03: Very catching.
SPEAKER_03: I'm sure management would like that.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I'm going to resign after this project anyway.
SPEAKER_03: That's just great.
