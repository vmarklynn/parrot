SPEAKER_02: Em
SPEAKER_03: About that design Perhaps What is most important in In remote control What is most important functional aspect?
SPEAKER_02: Un hoo
SPEAKER_01:...at least we have to make it work.
SPEAKER_03: It should be easy to work with. We can have a speech recommendation in the first place.
SPEAKER_03: We just have the television, I want which channel.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, what?
SPEAKER_03: Or we can say for example, recite all the proghtn9 instead of just remote control it is doing some searching for you so you don't have to look for the channel maybe I just want to press I want to have a button for all the movies tonight or a button for all the magazines all the information documentary tonight and then your list of view and I will choose from the list so instead of pressing the channel number íƒœ
SPEAKER_00: TV eitself could have it. I could talk to the TV television itself.
SPEAKER_02: I need not have any.
SPEAKER_02: You are far from the TV.
SPEAKER_00: We have some arrays or something.
SPEAKER_03: Different technology.
SPEAKER_03: The main idea I want to say is that there should be a function instead of choosing the TV channel there is an option you can choose either TV channels or the content of the program.
SPEAKER_03: It's a good idea
SPEAKER_01: but I think that technically it would be a little bit more tricky to achieve this.
SPEAKER_03: Because you see now all the TV programs are available on the web.
SPEAKER_03: They are available in the XML format or whatever format we don't care.
SPEAKER_03: We just said that there is some content.
SPEAKER_03: We just want to retrieve the content and then class it, sort them by the types of programs.
SPEAKER_03: Some of the websites they already provide this service.
SPEAKER_03: You can just use the service available.
SPEAKER_03: Download it to this remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Then there are only six buttons for six categories or the only seven buttons.
SPEAKER_03: So you just choose the category one and you reuse the same button for example to choose among the sorted list the program you want.
SPEAKER_03: You don't have to choose among 100 channels.
SPEAKER_03: If you have 100 channels you just have six buttons, seven buttons.
SPEAKER_02: We should also optimize the number of.
SPEAKER_01: I think that just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to navigate through the...
SPEAKER_01: Oh yes. So you launch?
SPEAKER_01: Channel program or content.
SPEAKER_01: So in an easy way.
SPEAKER_03: So you don't have to display here.
SPEAKER_03: Just display on the TV screen.
SPEAKER_01: Good idea.
SPEAKER_01: Which remote control we just navigate through the...
SPEAKER_03: I think there will be revolutionary.
SPEAKER_03: Because all the TV remote control we have are all numbers.
SPEAKER_03: Lots of buttons.
SPEAKER_03: And then you don't know what to choose.
SPEAKER_01: The end.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. So...
SPEAKER_01: I think for the technical points we have to check how to gather the data from the program or content and all these stuff.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. So we have five minutes to...
SPEAKER_03: We have sometimes to use the whiteboard.
SPEAKER_03: You can use it five minutes.
SPEAKER_00: And another interesting idea for this would be to have a light adaptation system depending upon the picture.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So if you are watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Some dark scene.
SPEAKER_00: So the lighting in the room changes.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. But we are designing just remote control.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, you have an option in the remote control.
SPEAKER_00: If you want to have that option you press that button in the remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Do you want to have a concepture remote control there or you just want to put the function in?
SPEAKER_03: If you want to...
SPEAKER_01: Please no mind.
SPEAKER_03: Go and draw something right.
SPEAKER_00: I am afraid you are forced to put your lapel.
SPEAKER_00: Where is it?
SPEAKER_02: The lapel.
SPEAKER_02: Before the design let's assume what?
SPEAKER_00: Where is it?
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: That one.
SPEAKER_02: This one.
SPEAKER_02: Before writing you can see that let's assume what we said.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So the most important function is to choose the content.
SPEAKER_03: We agree on that.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: The first one is to...
SPEAKER_03: buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Or you could be anything.
SPEAKER_03: You could put buttons to choose...
SPEAKER_04: uh...
SPEAKER_04: content.
SPEAKER_03: Or channels.
SPEAKER_03: So we have both the user can choose...
SPEAKER_03: Which one do you want?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, by content or by channel?
SPEAKER_03: By content or by channel?
SPEAKER_03: Choose by content or by channels?
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_03: And then what did we say just now?
SPEAKER_03: Other than this?
SPEAKER_01: And we have to find a way how to gather information about the content.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So technically how the problems that...
SPEAKER_03: how to do it is to...
SPEAKER_03: how to get the content?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's not very difficult to...
SPEAKER_01: to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by content.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Content.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So this we have to work it out.
SPEAKER_03: So this one is a problem.
SPEAKER_03: And...
SPEAKER_01: I think that's the...
SPEAKER_01: the main thing.
SPEAKER_01: To reflect about it.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So we'll get some information in the next meeting.
SPEAKER_03: So for now we get...
SPEAKER_03: This is the functional designer spec.
SPEAKER_03: That's the first aspect.
SPEAKER_04: All right.
SPEAKER_04: We'll get information and then we'll come back in...
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you everybody.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So maybe we'll meet in...
SPEAKER_02: maybe five minutes.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: We'll discuss the...
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: I think I'll become...
None: Oh, yeah.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
