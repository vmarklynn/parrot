SPEAKER_01: is
None: oh Uh-oh, off the menu keyboard does not surf
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so welcome everyone. So we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing a new remote control.
SPEAKER_00: So I will first start with warm welcome, opening stuff.
SPEAKER_00: Then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it.
SPEAKER_00: And then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will have to fulfill to complete this process.
SPEAKER_02: So it has to one thing, except 25 minutes but I have something else to do.
SPEAKER_02: So I have another meeting soon.
SPEAKER_02: So maybe you could hire a bit.
SPEAKER_02: It's true.
SPEAKER_02: I have another meeting so if you could...
SPEAKER_00: You have another meeting soon?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So I have to be quick for the loan more product.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So the goal is to have a remote control, so to have an advantage over our competitors, we have to be original, we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user friendly.
SPEAKER_00: So the design step will be divided in three main points.
SPEAKER_00: First it will be the functional design.
SPEAKER_00: Third is the conceptual design and then is the design design.
SPEAKER_00: So the functional design is to identify the main user needs, the technical function, the remote control should fulfill.
SPEAKER_00: And then we will move to conceptual design where we will specify the different components involved, what kind of user interface we want and what are the different trends in user interface and stuff like that.
SPEAKER_00: And then the detailed design will consist in specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've made in the second point.
SPEAKER_00: So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control, for each of us to draw your favorite animal on the white wall.
SPEAKER_00: What an original idea.
SPEAKER_00: Do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us without a good term?
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Let's go.
SPEAKER_02: You should have the same thing.
SPEAKER_00: If you want to react about this wonderful drawing, I let you comment.
SPEAKER_02: It's an abstract drawing of an ink tank.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: It's an abstract drawing.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's nice and original.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if it's a real drawing.
SPEAKER_02: It's an abstract drawing, so this is very important.
SPEAKER_00: You want to draw something?
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Sorry.
SPEAKER_01: You have to imagine a little bit.
SPEAKER_00: Of course, your animal is recorded, so it's not lost.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Sorry too.
None: Did you know?
SPEAKER_02: It's a cat.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's a cat.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: The name is Caramel.
SPEAKER_01: I think I'm too sure if I'm a cat.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Next time you'll do something, okay?
SPEAKER_02: Next time I'll come.
SPEAKER_00: I'm a bit short in the game.
SPEAKER_00: What could they draw?
SPEAKER_00: Maybe I can draw.
SPEAKER_00: A very simplified code.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if it looks like a bug.
SPEAKER_01: Quite square.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if it looks more like a dog.
SPEAKER_00: I would say.
SPEAKER_00: I hope that it helps you in the process of designing a robot.
SPEAKER_02: For putting a logo.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Let's move on.
SPEAKER_00: You're the financial objective of a project.
SPEAKER_00: It's to say to have a prediction cost lower than 12.5 euros.
SPEAKER_00: I have a selling price twice that price in order to target a profit of 50 million euros.
SPEAKER_00: Is there a market for a new remote control?
SPEAKER_02: It's a trendy, original, and fulfilled a single device remote control.
SPEAKER_00: We have to discuss that on the finder tool.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: You can suggest points like this.
SPEAKER_00: We have to decide, for example, if you can control one device or multiple.
SPEAKER_00: What are your ideas about that?
SPEAKER_00: Maybe I can have the opinion of the other things.
SPEAKER_02: If you bundled the remote control with something that we sell, then it could be a single device otherwise.
SPEAKER_02: It could be a programmable one.
SPEAKER_02: Otherwise, we would buy remote control from us.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So, if it sold by its own, it would rather be for multiple devices.
SPEAKER_00: Do you agree?
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe it should be for multiple devices.
SPEAKER_00: Do you have any ideas of design ideas or any technical requirements we should fulfill?
SPEAKER_01: I think we shouldn't have too many for my part.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not fighting it for any requirements right now.
SPEAKER_01: If you don't have so many buttons.
SPEAKER_00: A few buttons.
SPEAKER_00: Do you have it also to be lighted, not to be used in the dark?
SPEAKER_00: It might be a good idea.
SPEAKER_00: Do you have any idea of the trend in the domain?
SPEAKER_00: What it should look like or something like that?
SPEAKER_01: Something which is not squarely.
SPEAKER_00: With a box.
SPEAKER_02: Like for something that at least fits in your hand.
SPEAKER_00: The basic requirements.
SPEAKER_00: So, fitting your hand.
SPEAKER_02: And your pockets.
SPEAKER_00: And also it may be important for the remote control to be to resist to various shocks that can happen.
SPEAKER_00: What if it falls?
SPEAKER_00: What a proof as well.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe it is a original because you can use it in your bath.
SPEAKER_00: Whereas the others count.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe water proof would be very original.
SPEAKER_00: I think a water proof remote control.
SPEAKER_00: So that the people can use it in their bath.
SPEAKER_02: That could be similar.
SPEAKER_02: But if you don't have a remote control.
SPEAKER_02: You can just cover it with some plastic.
SPEAKER_00: But it is still something you have to buy.
SPEAKER_00: That's all the shock.
SPEAKER_02: I mean there are people that have a remote control.
SPEAKER_02: And they are worried that it's going to break and put some extra plastic around it.
SPEAKER_02: And they actually do it themselves.
SPEAKER_00: But maybe we can bulk it with already this plastic thing.
SPEAKER_00: And the water proof is not working that case.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe we can sell all that together.
SPEAKER_00: So plastic protection.
SPEAKER_00: And the water proof box as well.
SPEAKER_00: That might be good track to follow.
SPEAKER_00: But it is not a problem.
SPEAKER_01: I think we should have something.
SPEAKER_01: Most of the time I lose my remote control.
SPEAKER_01: We should have a special button on the TV.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe we can make the remote control.
SPEAKER_00: But we don't design the TV.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe we can have something you whistle.
SPEAKER_00: And the remote control.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So we can have a whistle remote control.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: A whistle.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: Whistle label.
SPEAKER_00: Whistle tracking.
SPEAKER_00: Whistle tracking.
SPEAKER_00: Whistle tracking remote control.
SPEAKER_00: That's a good idea.
SPEAKER_00: That's very original.
SPEAKER_00: And that's quite cool.
SPEAKER_02: But of course, you don't normally need any audio recording stuff on your remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: They have to go to the cost.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But still we have to have an advantage of our competitors.
SPEAKER_00: I think this is a good advantage.
SPEAKER_02: It's cool.
SPEAKER_02: I think I like that there.
SPEAKER_02: But I'm not sure about what you're giving us.
SPEAKER_00: We have to ask the cost of that's designed to the industrial designer.
SPEAKER_00: Which is you.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So try to find that for the XBT.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So next meeting is in 30 minutes of the company.
SPEAKER_00: So I will ask the industrial designer to find out more about this industrial design.
SPEAKER_00: So any working function we have discussed.
SPEAKER_00: So then I will ask the user interface designer to think about the point we discussed, like the number of buttons, the the fight that is lighted or not, things like that, and what would be convenient for the user.
SPEAKER_00: And also we ask the market expert to try to find out what are the absolute requirements, it's absolutely needed in remote control for the user.
SPEAKER_00: So and then I will just ask you to think about that and look at your mail because you will receive some good advice soon.
SPEAKER_00: So thank you.
SPEAKER_00: I think that's good.
SPEAKER_00: All for this point.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: So welcome back in five minutes.
SPEAKER_02: Have a nice day.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Anyway you will receive some messages.
SPEAKER_00: Can I check anything?
SPEAKER_00: Correctly...
SPEAKER_02: What?
None: What?
SPEAKER_01: I really see
None: What? What?
None: I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know
