SPEAKER_05: We still have to do our questionnaire.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. First of all, I'll start with the costs.
SPEAKER_03: Because that's going to influence our design.
SPEAKER_03: If you don't know if you already had a look or not...
SPEAKER_02: Did you do your questionnaire already?
SPEAKER_02: I already did it. It's not much.
SPEAKER_02: Because we have a problem.
SPEAKER_03: If you look closely, you can see it.
SPEAKER_03: I already took the liberty to make some suggestions.
SPEAKER_03: At the moment we have 15 buttons.
SPEAKER_03: One LCD screen, one advanced chip, one print.
SPEAKER_03: We use a sensor for the speech.
SPEAKER_03: We use kinetic energy.
SPEAKER_03: We wanted the buttons in a special color.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. The first thing we should drop.
SPEAKER_03: The special color of the buttons.
SPEAKER_02: That's for the trendy...
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Everything is.
SPEAKER_03: Should we switch to a hinted dynamo?
SPEAKER_03: It's still the same idea as kinetic energy.
SPEAKER_01: You should do it.
SPEAKER_01: People like it.
SPEAKER_05: Just do normal battery.
SPEAKER_01: It has to be 12 and a half.
SPEAKER_01: Oh my goodness.
SPEAKER_04: You're going to need these.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. So we're at 25.
SPEAKER_03: Do we keep the shape doubly curved?
SPEAKER_03: Do we go for single curved?
SPEAKER_05: I guess we'll have to go for single curved.
SPEAKER_05: We have to drop on everything.
SPEAKER_01: But we can keep it single curved with top view still curved.
SPEAKER_01: But from the side it's flat.
SPEAKER_01: And the screen is just...
SPEAKER_03: How about...
SPEAKER_03: The other option I saw was to drop the buttons 1 through 9.
SPEAKER_03: So you can directly access a channel.
SPEAKER_03: But instead I use only the up and down errors.
SPEAKER_03: That's what I was thinking.
SPEAKER_01: Skip 9 buttons and 4 and a half euros.
SPEAKER_02: We have lots of basic options.
SPEAKER_05: They don't need special colors.
SPEAKER_03: It's more like it.
SPEAKER_03: You were saying.
SPEAKER_05: That was exactly my point.
SPEAKER_05: Let's drop all the buttons and just make one.
SPEAKER_05: I mean we're going to use the LCD screen anyway.
SPEAKER_05: So we'll just have to use it for everything.
SPEAKER_05: And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen and select the channel.
SPEAKER_03: So maybe we can drop a few more buttons.
SPEAKER_02: We only need the manual arrow button thing.
SPEAKER_02: Everything you can do with the manual.
SPEAKER_05: We need one integrated button for everything.
SPEAKER_05: A joystick.
SPEAKER_05: I was...
SPEAKER_03: If you go to...
SPEAKER_05: If you go to our...
SPEAKER_05: If you are in the sound system there...
SPEAKER_05: And you want to adjust the treble for instance.
SPEAKER_05: This is just an example.
SPEAKER_05: You want to see a bar on which you can adjust it from 0 to 10.
SPEAKER_05: But you want a sound preview of how it's going to sound.
SPEAKER_05: So you want to click on it, activate it and when you move it, hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound.
SPEAKER_05: So you'll need a joystick or a battery.
SPEAKER_01: Or a battery scroll wheel push button.
SPEAKER_01: So that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it, adjust it, click again and then you're out of it.
SPEAKER_01: But you still need to have...
SPEAKER_01: Well you can use the scroll wheel as well for the channels.
SPEAKER_01: But you still have to have some button in the menu to go back.
SPEAKER_02: You can do one integrated scroll wheel push button.
SPEAKER_02: Then just drop all the other buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Well not all, not sound I guess.
SPEAKER_02: The cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, one integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button.
SPEAKER_02: So we have to make it more...
SPEAKER_03: You could also drop three more of these without losing much functionality.
SPEAKER_01: What is the sample sensor?
SPEAKER_01: Sample speed?
SPEAKER_01: Speed recognition.
SPEAKER_01: Good.
SPEAKER_03: Drop speed recognition?
SPEAKER_03: No but...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's possible.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, it's expensive but we never considered the possibilities of speed recognition.
SPEAKER_05: Because it can take the function of a lot of buttons.
SPEAKER_03: It's not very easy to use.
SPEAKER_01: No, it can be disturbed by noise.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, but let's say that...
SPEAKER_01: Let's see what's more popular.
SPEAKER_01: I guess the screen was more popular than the speed recognition.
SPEAKER_01: I have to look on that.
SPEAKER_01: Let me see.
SPEAKER_01: Now there are more people who like speed recognition than LCD screen.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, because if you...
SPEAKER_03: But if you...
SPEAKER_01: But it's both a high-priced...
SPEAKER_02: There's a lot of concept that we need to know.
SPEAKER_01: No, we keep the screen.
SPEAKER_01: It's about the same.
SPEAKER_01: 81 to 91%.
SPEAKER_05: We haven't really integrated this speech into the system so we can...
SPEAKER_05: Drop that.
SPEAKER_03: Let's drop the speech.
SPEAKER_03: For the last year's...
SPEAKER_03: So we still have three and a half year to lose.
SPEAKER_03: We need to lose some buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, if you lose the back, the okay button...
SPEAKER_03: Let's say we only have the four arrows...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01:...on the menu button.
SPEAKER_01: And then use...
SPEAKER_03: Or in the power button, you have also...
SPEAKER_01: Okay, and the menu button does also...
SPEAKER_01: Does the okay function then?
SPEAKER_01: When you in the menu...
SPEAKER_01: So that's when you're...
SPEAKER_01: So you activate the menu?
SPEAKER_02: If we do two integrated scroll wheel push buttons...
SPEAKER_02: We can drop all the push buttons...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: With one integrated button we can do the whole menu thing...
SPEAKER_02: And then we can do the channel, the volume, etc.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That would save 0.2 euros compared to...
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_02: No, it's three euros.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, two...
SPEAKER_03: This together is more expensive than...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, if...
SPEAKER_03: It's almost the same as...
SPEAKER_01: Okay, for example, if you have four buttons...
SPEAKER_01: The channel up and down, follow you.
SPEAKER_01: That's right, okay, I think we have to keep that.
SPEAKER_01: And then...
SPEAKER_01: And the power button.
SPEAKER_01: And the power button.
SPEAKER_01: So that's five.
SPEAKER_03: That's the basic.
SPEAKER_01: That's basic.
SPEAKER_01: That's what you need anyway.
SPEAKER_01: And then for the menu...
SPEAKER_01: You can have a button that activates the menu...
SPEAKER_01: Or do we just integrate a scroll wheel with a push button?
SPEAKER_01: And then if the moment you use the scroll wheel, the menu gets activated and then you can scroll to an option.
SPEAKER_01: Click on it.
SPEAKER_01: It goes into a feature.
SPEAKER_01: Click on it again.
SPEAKER_01: Slacks feature.
SPEAKER_01: School adjust it.
SPEAKER_01: Click again.
SPEAKER_01: It's okay.
SPEAKER_01: Then you only need one button to move back...
SPEAKER_01: Or...
SPEAKER_01: Or under each option...
SPEAKER_01: You set a screen thing...
SPEAKER_01: What says back?
SPEAKER_01: And you select that one.
SPEAKER_01: Click can, you go one step back.
SPEAKER_01: And in that menu...
SPEAKER_01: Scroll, click, one step back.
SPEAKER_01: So then you need five buttons...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And one integrated scroll wheel push button.
SPEAKER_01: But you can drop three buttons.
SPEAKER_00: But I see that...
SPEAKER_01: That's one euro more expensive.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, sorry.
SPEAKER_03: I could have...
SPEAKER_01: Because which button do we have now?
SPEAKER_01: Those five, which I mentioned, and then menu...
SPEAKER_01: And then...
SPEAKER_01: Power.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The four...
SPEAKER_01: Thanks for the arrows.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Power.
SPEAKER_05: If you go to 8, I don't know how to...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so four arrows...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Power.
SPEAKER_01: Power, probably.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's five.
SPEAKER_03: We have a back and a okay button.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, that's seven.
SPEAKER_01: I want to activate the menu.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's eight.
SPEAKER_01: But we can't reduce that.
SPEAKER_01: We keep this play.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Even if we drop three buttons from here, we still have to make some adjustments around here.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: We need the chip for the LCD display.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we need the headphones.
SPEAKER_02: That's okay, it's splastic.
SPEAKER_01: Instead of...
SPEAKER_03: They're not to make it wood, because that also is good in the market with the 45-plus people.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but that's not our market.
SPEAKER_03: No, that may be not, but maybe...
SPEAKER_03: It's better than plastic anyway.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know, hard plastic.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, plastic with a special color.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, plastic with a special color.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: No, but...
SPEAKER_01: Because we have to use the special color anyway, you forgot that.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So let's go for the plastic.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, plastic.
SPEAKER_01: And since it's not kinetic, it doesn't have to flip around that much.
SPEAKER_03: It's free.
SPEAKER_01: We still have a problem of two euros.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_02: If you drop two...
SPEAKER_02: The buttons, those are really needed.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we can drop them.
SPEAKER_02: And the advanced chip on the front.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you still need it.
SPEAKER_01: Do we really need that advanced chip for an LCD display?
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So the other option would be to go for the sample speaker, which can use a regular chip, which is six euros in total.
SPEAKER_05: It doesn't matter.
SPEAKER_01: I rather keep the display.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So the only option is a hand dynamo.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And something else.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, that's one euro, right?
SPEAKER_05: It can't be fed all the buttons in an integrated scroll push button, because that will save us one and a half euro already.
SPEAKER_01: And then integrated.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but that would make it not so easy to use.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's not that important, easy to use, but...
SPEAKER_05: Then you...
SPEAKER_05: Then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want.
SPEAKER_03: There's still two additional buttons, I believe.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, for you.
SPEAKER_05: At least one for power.
SPEAKER_03: I am power.
SPEAKER_03: This is three buttons and this.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, it's just as expensive as what we are now.
SPEAKER_02: It can integrate the button.
SPEAKER_02: How many functions can it have?
SPEAKER_03: Three.
SPEAKER_03: Up, down.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, endlessly.
SPEAKER_05: I mean, it can be a power button, as soon as it's powered on.
SPEAKER_05: You can...
SPEAKER_01: It probably works for like three seconds.
SPEAKER_05: In main menu, you can choose flip channel.
SPEAKER_05: You can choose sound options.
SPEAKER_01: Then you should do everything in the menu on the screen.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_05: Maybe we should, because we don't have money and we want to screen.
SPEAKER_03: You can choose this, drop this.
SPEAKER_03: Then we have a half euro left.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So we can maybe still use power bit.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but we...
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_05: I guess we have.
SPEAKER_01: It saves us four euros and it costs us two and a half.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: Let's see.
SPEAKER_01: We need one and a half.
SPEAKER_01: But we still 13 left.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: No, I'm miscalculated.
SPEAKER_01: 13, so still half.
SPEAKER_01: There goes the special...
SPEAKER_01: But that will make it last repeating, so that's no option.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, what else?
SPEAKER_03: Uncurved?
SPEAKER_03: No, no.
SPEAKER_02: We're sure about it.
SPEAKER_01: At fans, Chip, we need for the display.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it says right here.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: They made it very easy for us.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: We made it hard for ourselves with the display, but it's a cool feature.
SPEAKER_03: I don't think I can persuade the management to say, this is better for the markets, so it's all more difficult.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, what we could do is...
SPEAKER_02: Dropped the special collar.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And do the special collar for the buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, since we only have one button.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but...
SPEAKER_01: I mean, what is meant by special collar?
SPEAKER_01: I just...
SPEAKER_01: I do something else.
SPEAKER_03: I think black or white, I think.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think it's gray regular.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_05: But we definitely want the thing to be a special collar.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So I rather have an hand dynamo.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and then drop the collar.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You can still play with it then, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working, so I guess that isn't an option.
SPEAKER_02: Display.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: You only have to power it up when you want to use it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I know.
SPEAKER_02: If you have to power it up for 10 minutes.
SPEAKER_02: No, I don't think...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: The current status of chips are pretty...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Energy clean saving.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, true.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Let's go for the hand dynamo then.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, hand dynamo.
SPEAKER_03: Do we want an extra button?
SPEAKER_01: Or do we...
SPEAKER_01: Or do we do uncurved and flat?
SPEAKER_01: The style of...
SPEAKER_02: No, it has to be curved.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it has to be curved and you have that collar.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's the most important.
SPEAKER_02: That's the most important.
SPEAKER_02: Or something.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Is it a special form?
SPEAKER_01: What is special form?
SPEAKER_01: Oh, a special form.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe that's nicer.
SPEAKER_03: For scroll?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, no, we don't have any buttons.
SPEAKER_01: So, we're only...
SPEAKER_02: Make it a special collar then.
SPEAKER_02: We're going to integrate it better, and I think also...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we're going to make it a special collar then.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, this is just a scroll.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, push it down.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Make it a special collar then it looks fancy.
SPEAKER_03: So, whoa, where is it, Bidget?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Let's save it.
SPEAKER_02: Two special collars, we only have one left.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Let's do it like this.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, because it does not lose our identity of the product as we...
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Um...
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: Let's get this one.
SPEAKER_03: Hold.
SPEAKER_05: Wow, we come back to the drawing board then.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, back to work.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, all your drawings are pretty much...
SPEAKER_05: It's silly, because we should have had this meaning before we start drawing.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's a fun part of it.
SPEAKER_01: I wanted to tell you, Bidget.
SPEAKER_03: I wasn't allowed, so...
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: All right.
SPEAKER_03: I just forgot to save this.
SPEAKER_03: Just a minute.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, what's the next phase?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, this is the last phase, of course.
SPEAKER_01: The agenda by your humble PM.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, sorry.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Well, we first should have had a prototype presentation, so I actually saw that it hadn't made no sense because we had to draw everything.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: We went straight into finance.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that was more important.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Pushed up the agenda.
SPEAKER_03: Evaluation criteria, and you have to use something about that.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I sure did.
SPEAKER_01: And it combines with product evaluation.
SPEAKER_01: So you put it in the...
SPEAKER_01: We all have to keep in mind what has changed now.
SPEAKER_01: The end result is a bit left on...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Because the evaluation is based on the initial user requirements.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Let's make it big.
SPEAKER_01: Well, we evaluated the design with a seven point skill.
SPEAKER_01: It's following.
SPEAKER_01: The remote control is recording criteria blah blah blah.
SPEAKER_01: True or false, and then on the skill of seven points.
SPEAKER_01: If you all know it.
SPEAKER_01: Well, the criteria are based on the user requirements, the trends from the marketing research and marketing strategy of the company itself.
SPEAKER_01: Well, there are in a word document, which I will open now.
SPEAKER_01: Open up.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: It's open yet.
None: No.
SPEAKER_01: We all have to agree on a certain level.
SPEAKER_01: What's this?
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Well, the first point is the remote control matches the operating behavior of the young user.
SPEAKER_01: So that means the operating behavior was using quite a lot of functions.
SPEAKER_01: How do you think about that?
SPEAKER_05: I think it does.
SPEAKER_05: Because the operating behavior of the young user was also defined in color and shape.
SPEAKER_05: And the use of LCD, right?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The use of a little bit of does.
SPEAKER_01: It's mainly mainly concentrating on a lot of functions in this question.
SPEAKER_05: So do you think we have extended menus?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You can do a lot of these things.
SPEAKER_01: You can make a lot of extended menus.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, the possibilities are almost unlimited to build a menu in the screen.
SPEAKER_01: So on the scale from 1 to 7, what do you think?
SPEAKER_02: 2 or 3?
SPEAKER_01: 2 or 3?
SPEAKER_01: Something like that.
SPEAKER_01: Well, yes, it's 1.
SPEAKER_01: So what do you say?
SPEAKER_01: I agree on 2.
SPEAKER_01: Do you feel this in now?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_01: I say 2 personally, but.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and the new designers would say 3, but now in the original design.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but we have to evaluate, I guess, what we have now.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, then I say 3.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you say 3?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You say also 3?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, well, I say still 2, but that's a 3 then.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, you're marketing it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I know.
SPEAKER_01: So it's made bold.
SPEAKER_01: But it's not very clear.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe you like it.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe the color.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe other color, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Better.
SPEAKER_01: Red.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: It doesn't have to be bold anymore.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah, very true.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: True.
SPEAKER_01: Well, the remote control.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_04: Definitely one.
SPEAKER_04: It has to be.
SPEAKER_01: The remote control hides irrelevant or less used functions.
SPEAKER_01: For example, audio sets and screen settings.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's very true point.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, it hides all those functions.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, they're hidden in the screen.
SPEAKER_01: If you don't want to use them, you don't just scroll over them.
SPEAKER_01: You play some, I don't know where.
SPEAKER_01: So that's very true, I guess, for our case.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the second point.
SPEAKER_01: Not so much.
SPEAKER_01: It shows the relevant and most used functions.
SPEAKER_01: Power button.
SPEAKER_01: Do we still have a power button?
SPEAKER_01: Well, yeah, the button's integrated, huh?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So shit.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we've dropped it.
SPEAKER_01: You just push it in for...
SPEAKER_01: That's not what's integrated.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, just push it in for three seconds or something and then...
SPEAKER_01: Exactly, it's just like a mobile.
SPEAKER_03: Just goes for all of you and everything.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It shows relevant and most used functions.
SPEAKER_01: In Woodwell.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: On one side, I would say yes.
SPEAKER_01: say yes and the other side would say no. I don't know. It shows the most youth functions
SPEAKER_02: and they are relevant. Can you reach channels directly with just one button? No. With the
SPEAKER_01: scroll button. Yeah and then say channel and then. Well we should build it so that if
SPEAKER_05: you don't kind of push into the menu or something, when it's on, yeah. It's turned on. It automatically has the program and the volume function but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or something. Yeah. Or you double click it. But how do you change from volume to channel? No because it has four arrows right? No, no. No. Because you scroll
SPEAKER_03: wheel. Yeah. That you can push in. Yeah. I was thinking still about our integrated
SPEAKER_01: joystick. No. We have no buttons left. So kind of the joystick was not an option. Yeah so is it Bama? So you have to double click I mean for volume and three double click for the menu or something. Yeah. Hold it. Yeah. We'll make it a more scope. But ease of use was not very important. Yeah. Remodeling. So that should be true. Yeah. But that's not a question. And your most control shows the relevant and most use functions. Well I think it's pretty much in the middle. Yeah. For you have to search for them in the screen in the menu. So yeah. So maybe it's more like a five. Yeah. I would go for five or six.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah. Five or six. Five. Okay. Five. Five. All right. That's not this remote. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So remote control. Yeah. Yep. Just one button. All right. The remote control makes use
SPEAKER_01: of technological innovation like LCD screen and speech recognition. Well yeah. We dropped the speech recognition. But it has at least one innovation. I say to them. We still have
SPEAKER_05: the fruit and vegetable print. Yeah. But that's not that's not this question. Never mind.
SPEAKER_01: The other question. I'm a bit lost. This one. I think that too. To. Yeah. I think LCDs more usable than speech. Yeah. Definitely not the bold one. It's way more practical. Right.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. That's a fancy look. I feel we're using fruit and vegetable print. Primary colors are sponge-like material. It should have been two questions. I realize now because sponge-like
SPEAKER_05: material is dropped. But the look I feel. Yeah. So we still have the primary colors. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But only on the outside. Not on the button. The button has also color. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_05: One button. Yeah. Yeah. Still we dropped also on the double curve. Yeah. You can check
SPEAKER_01: with the cell sheet. Yeah. We have single curve now. And no color. And no material. Yeah. So maybe in the middle or something. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's. Yeah. Actually we didn't
SPEAKER_05: do so well on this one because it's basically an old one with little curve on the side and in a different color. Still. It's still hard. I mean the sponge-like and the 3D shape
SPEAKER_01: that would give it something younger fresh. Yeah. Yeah. But then we would have to drop our red screen. Oh, red. Yeah. You like balls. Yeah. I like balls. The road control
SPEAKER_04: this place is corporate logo. Yeah. Of course. Of course. Because you just have to draw.
SPEAKER_05: Just wait a minute. Yeah. But it's a white part. Because we couldn't hardly draw on the lower half of the screen. We couldn't make it big enough to actually draw in the. Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So I mean I wanted to put digits on the buttons as well. But there's enough space for the corporate
SPEAKER_01: logo. I mean. If we have only one button. Yeah. So I will say that is very true. And even
SPEAKER_05: the shape we have now simulates kind of an R and the reversed R doesn't it?
SPEAKER_01: The road control is easy to use. Well, I would say. No. Skill I would say 6 or something.
SPEAKER_05: I don't think it's easy to use. The only thing easy about it is that you don't have to
SPEAKER_02: move your fingers. Yeah. It's the only one button. You only have to control one button.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, exactly. And it has a nice screen. But yeah. It gives official feedback. Yeah. I would say 5 or 6. I would say 6. What do you say? It's really nice. Because you're putting everything.
SPEAKER_01: So 6 more. Yeah. Yeah. I would go for the 6 too. Okay. Yeah. Most folks got. Well, another question. The remote control is durable. I don't know if that's the correct word. Definitely
SPEAKER_05: imp casing. And you have a hard battery. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because the battery is still stinging. It's last forever. True. True. And the casing is blessing. The casing is hard
SPEAKER_01: plastic. Also last forever. Yeah. If you don't drop it too much, it's should last pretty long. I would go for one. Yeah. Well, I think rubber compared to better. So I think 2 is more appropriate. Okay. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Logo. Okay. I would go for 2. The last one.
SPEAKER_01: You can watch the controls. It's a good example for companies. You put the fashion in electronics.
SPEAKER_04: No. No. I would go for 4. Yeah. Because we kind of try to, but we kind of filled with the
SPEAKER_01: budget that we have. Yeah. True. Yeah. Okay. So a 4. It's, it's, it goes. It's not the best we could do. I guess. The last two with the budget because it's not the bad idea we had.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. So. So. That's it. If I understood it right, we have to count these numbers. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. We're talking about, yeah, we have to count them. Count them. Add them. Yeah. Just add them and then. It's five to start to calculate it. Yeah. I all made it. I all made it. I all made it possible of positive questions. So we can count it. I mean, if you have reversed questions, you have to reverse the skill. Okay. Yeah. So four. Did you make this questionnaire? Yeah. Thanks. Nice
SPEAKER_03: work. Okay. No. Three plus. I wouldn't be able to do that fast. Plus one plus five.
SPEAKER_01: Five. Oh. Easy. Question number four. Yeah. Yeah. Well, wait a second. Oh, it's going wrong. How hard is it? Okay. Pretty difficult. Yeah. Just start over. There's no, there's
SPEAKER_02: no numbs. You can't know. Yeah. It's a bit just type in the digits. They're all one
SPEAKER_05: digit numbers, right? And then you can count them together. Yeah. You can just count them
SPEAKER_01: by half. Let's move over to three plus one. Four. Four. Nine. Yeah. You're 11. 15. 16. 16. Oh, 16. 16 plus. Oh, six. 22. 22. Oh, hard as this. 22. Yeah. Nevermind. 24. 28.
SPEAKER_01: That was 28. 28. Okay. 28. Okay. Five by nine. By nine. That's a three. Yeah. The lower the score, the better, right? Yeah. 20. Yeah. 28. By nine. By nine. Makes three points.
SPEAKER_05: 11111111. So we're better than average. Yeah. Are you sure this number actually tells us something? No. I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some too negative. So if you give a true to a positive, it actually means that the lower the lower the better, but if you give true to a negative question, yeah, but there are
SPEAKER_01: no negative questions. I guess. No. Good example. You're doing that's good. Easy to use. Easy to use. This way is good. Fans you look at feel that's good. Yeah. In the face was also good. Marketing requirement. Yeah. Most use function. I guess you could do it. Hide this function. That was also a good thing. Yeah. And matches the upright of the user was also a good thing. Okay. We were positive questions. Yeah. Through by purpose. So yes. So the it tells us something. Yes. But the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those things. Yeah. Definitely. Definitely. Because now it's just an average. Yeah. It's
SPEAKER_05: better than average. But yeah. Okay. Because of the LCD screen. Yeah. So it looks and stuff. It's still. Yeah. It's not. It's not really eye catching except for the color. The color
SPEAKER_03: screen. Okay. So this we had this we had. Pro. Pro. Pro type presentation. We dropped. So the finance we looked we have redesigned. Not one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. We have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this. So you can just make one big LCD screen.
SPEAKER_05: With some casing around it. Yeah. Okay. We're still going to go for the fancy colors. Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Are we going to stick with the green or are we going to do blue? We can just use this one
SPEAKER_03: and then over painted with the bit on a special color. The frame is special color. One. One scroll button. Yeah. And you might want to add a infrared. Yeah. For what? It doesn't function. So we have to do other things. Well, we have to make and report every decision we made so far. All right. And I tried to get you just before I received the Excel sheet.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. So you made it start, right? Yeah. I'm somewhere. Should we give it some time? Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. That's how do we make the scores? I've taken this away also. And this. That's the
SPEAKER_01: infrared. Oh, yeah. Of course. Yeah. Four watts. Shape. Current. Oh. Yeah. We did a special
SPEAKER_03: color for the line width. That's it. Ten. Yeah. It's going to be one scroll. All right.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah. Yeah. And the look and feel is more natural than this. I think I have to make a.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, that's right. Yeah. Basically. I don't know. We had to drop. Yeah. It smells very fashionable. Any more. It's okay. It's really ugly. Yeah. Where did we start? Which was it? Or 26 something like that? Yeah. That looks a little bit more special color for it.
SPEAKER_02: Like a olive color and then this one or our spickles in it. I don't know. Spickles. Yeah. Can we
SPEAKER_05: do with? Can we do a print? I'm not sure. I think we have to choose. If you see the options. Okay. Special color. We do have special color. Does it mean I read it already.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. It's very special. Shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Some big dots. Purple. Purple. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no. My remote is actually. Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, no. That's why we have that bottom. Oh, yeah. It's so cute. Oh, no. Just cut. Control
SPEAKER_02: Z. Is that that? Yeah. Yeah. How did we do that? Just dual screen. No. That's coming
SPEAKER_05: deleted. Yes, we can try. It doesn't respond also to the undo. It looks like it's crashed. No, very nice. Where do you want some more dots? Yeah, over here. You can even
SPEAKER_03: draw anymore. Even kill me. You pushed a button or something. Or can you just push
SPEAKER_02: a button? It's not the prettiest I know. It's not so random. It's okay. Actually, the
SPEAKER_01: R and another R. Yeah. It's called the real remote, right? Yeah. Maybe it can say that,
SPEAKER_03: the real remote. Yeah, just on the middle of the LCD display. Yeah. Welcome. We can make
SPEAKER_05: a logo. Yeah. Yeah. Put it like the shape. Designed by something like that. I mean, it's
SPEAKER_02: not too... It's not their logo, is it? Yeah. Do they have a logo? Oh, yeah. This is
SPEAKER_03: a logo. Two R's. Yeah. You can just reuse that because the name is the shape. You can
SPEAKER_05: copy and paste the picture if you want. So, shall we do the logo in black or not? Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. What's that? Looks more like a campfire. Are you dissing my drawing? This is
SPEAKER_05: one? Yeah. It looks like a ribbon. Yeah. Okay. So, we want to draw. This is actually quite nice. Do we need to do anything? I hear you people are typing. Typing the report. I don't
SPEAKER_02: see any new messages. Luckily. Luckily. Is the last assignment or final? Yeah. It's
SPEAKER_01: almost four. What time do we have to deliver the report? Four o'clock. That's four, yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Before that. Just in comparison. This is really bizarre. It looks like there's a...it
SPEAKER_03: looks like butterfly. It's somewhere inside. No, it's on the beamer. It's not a beamer. It's
SPEAKER_05: a normal TV screen kind of thing. It's somewhere in here. It's only. Yeah. It's something
SPEAKER_01: was projection from behind. I guess. Oh. Yeah. There is some kind of projection I think. Yeah. It's a beamer. But then with a mirror. It looks like a big screen, but in fact, it
SPEAKER_05: isn't. So, are we going to change anything to this? Well, it's a single curve. So,
SPEAKER_02: this is a flat. Yeah, exactly. Okay. It doesn't matter. But it's better to have in the
SPEAKER_01: front this kind of shape because it looks nice. I mean, you see more of this than of that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. More like that. Yeah. And this is also going to be...that's very ideal.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah. But sometimes then all of a sudden it does work. Yeah. What's this? That's the detector.
SPEAKER_05: Oh. Okay. I don't see a detector over there. Yeah. I think you only need two points or not.
SPEAKER_01: I thought it was a kind of thing to put it on and then draw right lines for something.
SPEAKER_05: It's not working because it's more slanted. Yeah. Yeah. Where it just messed it up. Well, maybe.
SPEAKER_05: Oh. Yeah. Yeah. It matters for the aim of this thing. Yeah. Well, it wasn't good.
SPEAKER_01: It was to make it 90 degrees. Yeah. It has to touch the corners, I guess. But this one wasn't good because if I was drawing here, I drew a line and then it came over here.
SPEAKER_03: Though you probably have to recalibrate. Yeah. Five minutes to the end of the meeting.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah. And the recalibration is done using this icon here. Can we get to that icon?
SPEAKER_03: Oh, it's so hard. Yeah. Well, I did. Yeah. It's working again. It's working again.
SPEAKER_01: It's better than before. Okay. Yeah. We're improving that. Do you go with it? Yeah. It has improved pretty much.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah. It's only a bit like to that side, but that is that one. By the way, what is better?
SPEAKER_05: This one makes the angle either like this. So if I change this, it will go there.
SPEAKER_05: If I change that, it will go there. It's better than it was, I guess.
SPEAKER_05: I will take this away because it looks silly. Yeah. We're pretty well.
SPEAKER_01: Five minutes before the meeting is over. And then we have to write this.
SPEAKER_03: And I don't know if he has to present because I didn't receive any information about that.
SPEAKER_01: All right. Maybe we will. After these five minutes, you have to...
SPEAKER_03: I have still 10 minutes. What's this anyway?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. All right. After that five minutes, it looks like it can't work.
SPEAKER_03: You can just have coffee or...
SPEAKER_03: No, they don't have beer. You can just finish my presentation.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. The presentation is still open. So you finish that and you'll see...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, next slide.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we have to do that project evaluation. Just do that quickly.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. How do you do it?
SPEAKER_03: Well, basically what that says, we discuss it.
SPEAKER_03: So, what?
SPEAKER_03: The project process, Gold, you were pleased with the process as well.
SPEAKER_05: Do you mean the interaction between us or...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, the interaction and the steps he followed.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, well, at first I was really stressed because it went a bit fast.
SPEAKER_05: But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on the second time, I think I did a bit better.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah. And the third time, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And we move more to working together as a team because at first you make your individual contribution and then come here and you have no idea what the others have to make.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah. And then finally you have some idea. Okay, this is what we're going to make together and I will arrange this.
SPEAKER_01: And you arrange that and you have a kind of idea of what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own.
SPEAKER_01: So the process, I mean the interaction between us became better and better, I guess.
SPEAKER_02: Especially after the first meeting.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, especially if you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting, I guess.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, and what's that due to my leadership?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Well, you did become more assertive the second time around to that.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: You were more in charge kind of thing.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Was there enough room for creativity?
SPEAKER_05: I guess so.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I mean...
SPEAKER_02: Only the financial parts...
SPEAKER_02: Limit is...
SPEAKER_01: Afterwards, but if you don't take that into account, there's a plenty of room for creativity also.
SPEAKER_01: Not only did drawing and then the making of a thing itself, but also in explaining it to the other people by means of...
SPEAKER_01: We were pretty democritic.
SPEAKER_01:...the powerpoint and words and stuff like that.
SPEAKER_03: About the board and such.
SPEAKER_03: Did you stop in?
SPEAKER_03: Was it helpful?
SPEAKER_01: I think in essence, the digital pen is better than the smart board because it just works better.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I've made several notes just to test it and just put the pen into it and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly.
SPEAKER_01: So it's better, better device than the screen.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe.
SPEAKER_01: But the screen is useful in essence, but it doesn't work that well.
SPEAKER_05: The pen is more intuitive because we're all used to writing with pen.
SPEAKER_05: As I said, I have no idea how powerpoint works.
SPEAKER_05: So it will take me a half a day to be able to make a normal powerpoint presentation.
SPEAKER_05: But once I get to know the program, probably, I mean, it looks better.
SPEAKER_05: So there's something like that. You can give it a kind of home style like we have the logo and everything.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: Good morning.
SPEAKER_01: Finished meeting now.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Are there any new IDs about this?
SPEAKER_03: Oh, I think it's really useful.
SPEAKER_01: Especially useful, I guess, to evaluate designs and graphical stuff and the dull screen and stuff like that.
SPEAKER_02: I think the powerpoint is too limited.
SPEAKER_02: You can draw easy in the powerpoint.
SPEAKER_02: The drawing board has to be integrated into powerpoint so that you can just easily...
SPEAKER_05: The problem with powerpoint for me is that you have to put in the pre-made chunks as well.
SPEAKER_05: You can draw something on the sketch board and then take it there or whatever.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But it's useful to show something to a small audience and then to...
SPEAKER_02: It's okay, but...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: These kind of screens, this size, are useful to discuss things.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Check your email.
SPEAKER_04: You should enter our questionnaire.
SPEAKER_01: Yauk.
SPEAKER_01: You also.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: All right.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, boss.
SPEAKER_05: See you in a second, huh?
SPEAKER_01: See you soon.
SPEAKER_01: I hope so.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, we have to pull it this way.
SPEAKER_05: All right.
