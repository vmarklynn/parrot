SPEAKER_03: I'm not sure how to make sure to do it.
SPEAKER_03: These are stripes.
SPEAKER_03: I've picked this animal because it's very fast.
SPEAKER_03: It is, it knows exactly what it wants.
SPEAKER_03: It hardly ever waces any resources.
SPEAKER_03: What does it want?
SPEAKER_03: Well, basically, it hunts for prey.
SPEAKER_03: But it does it always in a very well thought way.
SPEAKER_03: It knows exactly what it wants.
SPEAKER_03: It never kills an animal just for the killing.
SPEAKER_03: So it's very efficient and it tries to do everything as fast as possible.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And it always goes for security in seeking hide spots and doing everything.
SPEAKER_03: Security, speed and efficiency is important.
SPEAKER_03: And I think that it's great.

SPEAKER_00: I guess.
SPEAKER_00: You take your free and use a trendy interface.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: You're supposed to make it different from what other people have and make it a little distinct.

None: Finish meeting now.
SPEAKER_00: Put this down.
SPEAKER_00: Exactly.
SPEAKER_00: As well.
SPEAKER_00: I guess we have a little time extra on it.
SPEAKER_00: Just a little quick discussion to open our work.
SPEAKER_00: What do you guys think about the first ideas is very short.
SPEAKER_00: I'll start with you.
SPEAKER_00: What are your first ideas for new products?
SPEAKER_01: Well, I basically had a question.
SPEAKER_01: Are you going to introduce a multi remote control?
SPEAKER_01: Is it just the TV or do we want to?
SPEAKER_00: The project I got was just for TV remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Just for TV remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I guess.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I was thinking about design remote control with our motto and all.
SPEAKER_01: The thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with.
SPEAKER_01: No rational changes or whatever.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So very intuitive design.
SPEAKER_00: I guess.
SPEAKER_01: We might have to consider other design aspects of our product.
SPEAKER_01: So that was something I wanted to add.
SPEAKER_01: And perhaps some usability aspect TV is becoming central in most homes.
SPEAKER_01: Do we want people who are disabled in any way to be able to use it as well?
SPEAKER_00: I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it.
SPEAKER_00: I think really disabled people might be a problem.
SPEAKER_00: But I think it's a little thing to take into consideration.
SPEAKER_00: I think we really need to cut the meeting short.
SPEAKER_00: Anything you want to share quickly?
SPEAKER_03: Only one thing that has to be an as according to me is the material it is made of.
SPEAKER_03: It should be something light.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Speak to itself.
SPEAKER_03: It should be light.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
