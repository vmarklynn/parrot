SPEAKER_03: Hello again.
SPEAKER_01: Hey, Project Manager.
SPEAKER_04: Project Manager, I'm talking to tell you I have little problems with my laptop.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So I had a little less time to complete.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: A little problem.
SPEAKER_04: A little problem.
SPEAKER_04: A little problem.
SPEAKER_04: A little problem.
SPEAKER_01: A little problem.
SPEAKER_01: Project Manager.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Your project manager.
SPEAKER_03: Welcome to the conceptual design meeting for real reaction.
SPEAKER_03: Hello again.
SPEAKER_03: It's the same as the last time.
SPEAKER_03: Also this time there will be three presentations.
SPEAKER_03: And we must reach a decision on the remote control concepts.
SPEAKER_03: At the end, when I finish it off, I have some info from a more class I visited.
SPEAKER_03: I have some information.
SPEAKER_01: I'm doing a lot.
SPEAKER_03: Mostly.
SPEAKER_03: I used to master.
SPEAKER_03: The concepts on where we must reach a decision on are from RF2 sorts.
SPEAKER_03: Component concepts and user interface concepts.
SPEAKER_03: The first one is really about the total package.
SPEAKER_03: Well, we have decided to do the touch screen.
SPEAKER_03: But it must be a case around it.
SPEAKER_03: So it won't be as breakable.
SPEAKER_03: How about the energy?
SPEAKER_03: Can you reload it?
SPEAKER_03: Or just berries which you must exchange?
SPEAKER_03: The user interface concept with the type and the supplements where to put word button.
SPEAKER_03: And I would say, yes, can you begin?
SPEAKER_03: Sure.
SPEAKER_03: At the end, I will take notes.
SPEAKER_03: At the end, the minute will be at the share pool.
SPEAKER_00: Let me see.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's this one.
SPEAKER_05: Right.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I'll be talking about components.
SPEAKER_00: What I did was I reviewed previously used items by two different age groups.
SPEAKER_00: Below 45 and above.
SPEAKER_00: And I just watched what the differences are.
SPEAKER_00: I checked what we want and how can we aim at the target group.
SPEAKER_00: What I found was that senior citizens.
SPEAKER_00: Sorry.
SPEAKER_00: It's okay.
SPEAKER_00: They like the traditional materials like wood and such more.
SPEAKER_00: Wood and chrome.
SPEAKER_00: They like luxurious styles.
SPEAKER_00: Whereas the young and dynamic.
SPEAKER_00: They like more soft materials.
SPEAKER_00: Finger of the teletabits, for instance.
SPEAKER_00: Soft and fluffy and colorful.
SPEAKER_00: Well, the shapes are curved and round.
SPEAKER_00: You get them at the picture.
SPEAKER_00: And they like sports and gaming.
SPEAKER_00: And it gives them the vitality.
SPEAKER_03: So, one little question about the material.
SPEAKER_03: A soft material for a remote control.
SPEAKER_00: I'll get to that.
SPEAKER_00: You'll see.
SPEAKER_00: First off, let's start with the energy.
SPEAKER_00: I had a choice between a few different sources.
SPEAKER_00: But the two basic sources that I found were the best possible with a battery versus kinetic.
SPEAKER_00: When you move something, it gets energy.
SPEAKER_00: I figured, well, that's kind of high-tech.
SPEAKER_00: When you have a remote control, when you pick it up, it has power.
SPEAKER_00: That would be actually very nice.
SPEAKER_00: I figured, but we could also use a battery that's better.
SPEAKER_01: When the power gets low, you have to shake it or something.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you just have to shake it around.
SPEAKER_00: Then it has some more energy.
SPEAKER_00: So, you could just go for a battery or you could go for both.
SPEAKER_04: Have you considered the option of using the solar panel?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I actually did.
SPEAKER_00: But the thing is about solar panels.
SPEAKER_00: You have to have light.
SPEAKER_00: Some light preferably.
SPEAKER_00: You could use normal light, but you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something.
SPEAKER_00: So, ultimate use of a solar panel.
SPEAKER_00: You could use solar panels.
SPEAKER_00: But you have to implement them into the remote control, leaving you a bit less space for the interface.
SPEAKER_00: So, what's actually, I figured that, well, seeing that you'll always be within the distance of TV.
SPEAKER_00: From the TV, there comes a whole bunch of light.
SPEAKER_00: So, it would actually power itself from the TV, but you would just take up all the space and you wouldn't have the full amount of power actually used.
SPEAKER_00: So, prefer a kinetic?
SPEAKER_00: I prefer a kinetic, because it's, well, the costs aren't that much higher.
SPEAKER_00: And it's just a bit more high-tech than a normal battery.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, if you don't move a remote control.
SPEAKER_00: Well, you pick it up and you press buttons and...
SPEAKER_03: That's enough to keep the energy level...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, well, actually it is.
SPEAKER_00: And if it isn't, you just shake it a bit.
SPEAKER_00: And it would power up again.
SPEAKER_00: But like I said, you could use a battery that you just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves.
SPEAKER_00: And for rest, you just use all the battery.
SPEAKER_01: And when the battery doesn't work, I usually shake it too.
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Exactly. Thank you, Tim.
SPEAKER_00: Furthermore, we checked the cases.
SPEAKER_00: We have different options concerning the cases here.
SPEAKER_00: You simply add a basic standard model.
SPEAKER_00: It was kind of square and I figured that was a bit boring.
SPEAKER_00: So, you could go for the single curve or the double curve.
SPEAKER_00: Single curve, it's just a nice curve.
SPEAKER_00: But you could go in a double curve.
SPEAKER_00: And that's several different dimensions.
SPEAKER_00: That gives you a whole new...
SPEAKER_03: Dynamic loop.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that gives you a younger and more high-tech look, I figured.
SPEAKER_00: But we'll discuss later.
SPEAKER_01: Are you going to draw it?
SPEAKER_00: What?
SPEAKER_00: One meter draw.
SPEAKER_00: In 3D.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I can't imagine.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I could show you.
SPEAKER_00: Well, let's say you...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Let's say that's your standard design.
SPEAKER_00: That's a bit your standard design.
SPEAKER_00: But you could actually go like something like this.
SPEAKER_00: And then in 3D effect you could go.
SPEAKER_00: So, you just...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, this is a bit difficult to even.
SPEAKER_00: I didn't take a major in art.
SPEAKER_00: But you could have a whole new, the back.
SPEAKER_00: The depth you could just play around a bit.
SPEAKER_00: You don't have to use standard...
SPEAKER_03: A little artistic.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you could at least move space for creativity.
SPEAKER_00: It might be an idea, but...
SPEAKER_00: Well, for the more...
SPEAKER_00: Well, plastic versus rubber, we could choose what's better, plastic or rubber.
SPEAKER_00: I prefer rubber because it feels...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's soft.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's soft and...
SPEAKER_00: I like soft people.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, plastic also has that cheap feeling to it.
SPEAKER_00: I usually associate plastic with something as cheap.
SPEAKER_00: That's maybe just me.
SPEAKER_00: We could talk about it later.
SPEAKER_00: For the more buttons, traditional or touch screen, well, we discussed it in a previous meeting.
SPEAKER_00: So, I figured, just leave it at LCD.
SPEAKER_00: And chipset.
SPEAKER_00: Well, if we are going to use traditional buttons, we could go with a simple chipset.
SPEAKER_00: But if we decide to go on an LCD screen, we would use an advanced chipset and that would bring the necessary cost source with it.
SPEAKER_00: So, that's something we have to keep in mind.
SPEAKER_00: If it isn't a manageable budget wife, we'd have to go off to simple buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I think we're going to sell 10 millions of them.
SPEAKER_01: So, I bet a big company in Korea or Taiwan, like Samsung, engavers a big discount on the chipset.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, probably.
SPEAKER_01: Usually chips are more expensive than one dollar.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, probably, but so.
SPEAKER_00: But, yeah, that shouldn't be a real issue.
SPEAKER_00: That shouldn't be that big issue.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I just had a...
SPEAKER_00: I put in big summaries, we could discuss it a bit.
SPEAKER_00: What are your ideas when concerning battery versus kinetic?
SPEAKER_04: I think you should use kinetic as a backup.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, combination.
SPEAKER_00: Combination, right?
SPEAKER_00: You used battery and charged it up with kinetic.
SPEAKER_00: When you pick it up, it charges up.
SPEAKER_01: Like an acu.
SPEAKER_01: Acu.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Just like the wire from Saika.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, exactly.
SPEAKER_00: What do you think?
SPEAKER_03: I prefer both to combine them.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_00: Well, that would bring some more cash, but I mean...
SPEAKER_00: Who cares, right?
SPEAKER_00: That's the project manager's problem.
SPEAKER_04: Of course, battery in.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: 50 cents.
SPEAKER_00: Well, and then we have single-curve versus double-curve.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, maybe I have something in my presentation to...
SPEAKER_00: Good, but then.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, now we'll just wait and...
SPEAKER_00: Plastic versus rubber?
SPEAKER_00: Rubber.
SPEAKER_04: Rubber, isn't it possible to make combination what kind of rubber?
SPEAKER_04: It's all bendable, we move, so you've got to sit there around.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, I figured it would be rather hard.
SPEAKER_00: Rubber, this is an occasion, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Rubber casing, because if you use a touch screen, it's just the casing around it, so you could go for plastic, but I figured...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I would choose rubber.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe I can ask it right now, the question that I have, is it possible if it's necessary to make a touch screen square?
SPEAKER_04: It is, and I think, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: I think that the touch screens are generally square, but it's the case you put around it that makes a shape.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, maybe we can do it.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, but if you have a square LCD screen, you put a case around it that has like bulbs or...
SPEAKER_01: That covers part of the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that would solve custom-isable.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, I get it.
SPEAKER_00: So, one of the opinions, rubber or plastic, I prefer rubber.
SPEAKER_00: Me too.
SPEAKER_00: You too?
SPEAKER_00: You sure?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it has a bit.
SPEAKER_04: As long as it's firm, and you don't...
SPEAKER_04: It's not bendable or something, I think that goes too far.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it shouldn't flop over when you hold it.
SPEAKER_00: No, that's...
SPEAKER_00: That's the chipset that will hold it firm in place, and an LCD screen will...
SPEAKER_04: Might even bounce back when you drop it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it might.
SPEAKER_00: Traditional versus LCD wire figured we're all set on that.
SPEAKER_00: And then also the simple versus advanced.
SPEAKER_00: I figure if we go for LCD, we should have the advanced.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So that shouldn't be a problem.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, well, that's my...
SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: Welcome.
SPEAKER_01: Can I do anything?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, do your thing.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Bringing it on.
SPEAKER_01: Expert map.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, last week...
SPEAKER_01: I went to Paris and Milan, a professional trans-watching, from marketing, our research and development department, and I, went to Paris and Milan.
SPEAKER_01: In Paris and Milan, we asked different people, differing in age and in income, the amount of money to spend.
SPEAKER_01: What they like in design and material nowadays.
SPEAKER_01: Findings.
SPEAKER_01: Our main audience, so that's people below 40, prefer the following.
SPEAKER_01: At first, the colors of fruit, very basic colors like Janus explained.
SPEAKER_01: Fresh colors, green, red, strawberry, red, yellow, banana, yellow.
SPEAKER_01: Considering material, yeah, they like spongy material, like spongy, like a soft material.
SPEAKER_01: Janus mentioned it also.
SPEAKER_01: I think he did some findings himself.
SPEAKER_01: You were in Paris.
SPEAKER_01: Like this.
SPEAKER_01: Like big, flashy colors, fresh.
SPEAKER_01: It's nice, I think.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, our secondary audience, people above 40, 40 years in age, they like the dark, traditional colors.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, materials like wood.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, wood is not a material you build every mocton trollar.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, you could.
SPEAKER_01: No, you could.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but just a wood and a cake.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Like you have those fake panels on the floor, but that isn't wood anyway.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: But that's our secondary audience.
SPEAKER_01: We decided to take, yeah, the people below 40.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: This doesn't apply.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, the third.
SPEAKER_01: There are some overall thoughts about new remote controls.
SPEAKER_01: They have to look fancy.
SPEAKER_01: They should be technological, innovative.
SPEAKER_01: They should be fancy things in.
SPEAKER_01: And easy to use.
SPEAKER_01: But that's common.
SPEAKER_01: My personal preferences.
SPEAKER_01: We have to aim at our main audience and therefore use fresh colors.
SPEAKER_03: Would you prefer, did you choose the color of your remote control?
SPEAKER_01: Oh, I'll come to that in a second moment.
SPEAKER_01: I think about removable covers as he mobile telephone market to customize your own remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Like the Nokia, the removable covers just put a red on it and go to shop and buy green one.
SPEAKER_01: A third.
SPEAKER_01: Material being used could well be stuff like rubber.
SPEAKER_01: Do advantages.
SPEAKER_01: It fits within the current market trends and it adds safety to your remote when you drop it.
SPEAKER_01: So to come back to your question, I think, and the people in Milan and Paris also think that the rubber should be pretty hard, like seen on regular mobile phones.
SPEAKER_01: Actually, they have a lot in common,
SPEAKER_00: phones and... Well, I actually saw a phone that could use this remote.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, maybe you could use your remote at the phone.
SPEAKER_00: Hey!
SPEAKER_01: Let me make the next step.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, exactly.
SPEAKER_01: And my second sheet of personal preferences.
SPEAKER_01: We have to reconsider the speech function recognition.
SPEAKER_01: It's very innovative.
SPEAKER_01: So that you say,
SPEAKER_02: SPSS, and it goes to...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, like something.
SPEAKER_01: You can see that a market is just screaming for new technologies like speech recognition and stuff, but we have to keep the costs in mind.
SPEAKER_01: About 50 years.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it can be very expensive.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, second, building games like Snake or Tetris.
SPEAKER_01: I'm using the younger users.
SPEAKER_01: Also, the link with mobile phones.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but you don't use that games when you're watching television.
SPEAKER_03: No, but...
SPEAKER_01: No, okay.
SPEAKER_01: But you don't use games when you're making a telephone call.
SPEAKER_01: It's just the same.
SPEAKER_04: When your parents are watching some boring program, you can take a remote and do something else.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_01: When you're at college.
SPEAKER_00: You take your remote to a school.
SPEAKER_01: You also take...
SPEAKER_01: You take your iPad and go play games.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, I do that.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, and...
SPEAKER_01: At third, I stick with it.
SPEAKER_01: The login functionality.
SPEAKER_01: With the slogan, take parents to control through a new dimension.
SPEAKER_05: Very nice.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, so...
SPEAKER_03: Oh, great, really.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: You interface contents.
SPEAKER_04: Well, it's just simple PowerPoint markup.
SPEAKER_04: I want to make it more dynamic for you so I'll do it there.
SPEAKER_04: But the main concept is...
SPEAKER_04: Take one big touch screen.
SPEAKER_04: Always display the primary buttons, clear and visible.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe even like this with uses of a lot of space.
SPEAKER_04: And make the menu structure changeables.
SPEAKER_04: Where if you press system...
SPEAKER_04: Well, multiple system options can maybe five or ten or one can fit in.
SPEAKER_04: Or maybe even a step further when you want to...
SPEAKER_04: Have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button.
SPEAKER_04: And other buttons can maybe display it here if that's necessary.
SPEAKER_04: And well, how do we want to look?
SPEAKER_04: That's a remote look.
SPEAKER_04: Well, you've got to hold it in one hand.
SPEAKER_04: So the middle like all remotes have to be a little bit small.
SPEAKER_04: So you can put it inside your hands.
SPEAKER_04: And some remotes you can use with a thumb.
SPEAKER_04: But I think that's too difficult for this one.
SPEAKER_04: So you can make it a little broader here and here.
SPEAKER_04: And maybe use your thumb on the main buttons.
SPEAKER_04: And use your other hands on the menu structure.
SPEAKER_04: So here are going to be the program buttons, one, two, three, four, etc.
SPEAKER_04: And the volume control and program control maybe.
SPEAKER_04: And down here...
SPEAKER_04: Well, yeah, this could be one big LCD menu structure.
SPEAKER_04: So you can use it in this way.
SPEAKER_04: One thing you've got to keep in mind, keep the remote clear of too much function at the same time.
SPEAKER_04: Know that if you are changing the menu structure here, and well, I still believe you should keep displaying the buttons.
SPEAKER_04: But if you're programming the caller of the TV, do not display 20 other options that are possible.
SPEAKER_04: Keep it as simple as possible.
SPEAKER_04: And do not use too many levels.
SPEAKER_04: Do not have to select screen first and then brightness and then caller and on plus and on push plus 20 times.
SPEAKER_04: But just need just in one button if possible.
SPEAKER_04: And well, in all known TV levels channel one, two.
SPEAKER_04: And when you get to 10 and want to go back, well, you have a problem.
SPEAKER_04: You just must move more into the TV, you press 10 and you go to 10 and not to 1 and 0 after that.
SPEAKER_04: So the button less.
SPEAKER_04: And things like teletext, put them in the menu, things like...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: What do you think about it back and forth come up?
SPEAKER_01: Buttons, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Like an internet tech plan.
SPEAKER_04: Trying to tell it is volume plus and minus.
SPEAKER_04: And this is program plus and minus.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, but that is for going from 4 to 5.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: But if you go from 2 to 8.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, you're watching 2U sports on 17.
SPEAKER_04: And your wife is watching you can switch.
SPEAKER_04: Switch easy.
SPEAKER_04: Well, yes, I think that's a good idea.
SPEAKER_04: But well, my friends would be put it in the menu.
SPEAKER_04: And if you are using that button a lot of times, well, of course, that menu will still be displayed on the screen.
SPEAKER_04: You just don't have to play games in between.
SPEAKER_04: But if you're really switching between 2 channels, you won't have time to use the other options.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, well, I already told that.
SPEAKER_04: That's why I conclude.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I think we can discuss a little about the three kind of revolutionary things Tim came with.
SPEAKER_03: The parental control games and the voice recognition.
SPEAKER_03: There's not too much decision on that one.
SPEAKER_03: So I think the parental control is a good function to put in the remote.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know how you think about it.
SPEAKER_04: There are all the languages put it in the menu structures somewhere.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but properties and parents are comfortable.
SPEAKER_01: How I see it is you put it on the remote.
SPEAKER_01: And then you have like windows, log on screen with parents, children, something like that.
SPEAKER_01: When you want to use a parents option, it has to be fast.
SPEAKER_04: You don't want to go down and watch the news at 8 o'clock and turn it on.
SPEAKER_04: Wait 20 seconds for the log on screen and remember your code.
SPEAKER_03: But I think most people find it much more important that their children don't watch sexual violence on the television.
SPEAKER_03: Wait 10 or 15 seconds longer so they can finally watch it because they use like with their XB simple log on the address.
SPEAKER_04: Push parents and if you push parents then you have to log in.
SPEAKER_01: Go to three digits and a few log in like two on three and it's in.
SPEAKER_04: And if you push children you don't have to log in.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if it's worth the time and effort we're going to spend on it.
SPEAKER_00: Well, it's a simple function but it's going to take a lot of resources and a lot of time into programming because you'll have to start working with the profiles and such.
SPEAKER_00: And I'm not sure if it's actually worth investing that much time and effort into it.
SPEAKER_03: I don't think there's big markets for it because you read many times in magazines and stuff and you read on the news that.
SPEAKER_03: They believe that children are influenced by television and well we're aiming to below 40 years.
SPEAKER_03: But there are a lot of people below 40 who have children in young age who want them to not watch violent or anything.
SPEAKER_04: Well, maybe some idea on that.
SPEAKER_04: Just make the remote as it is.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: But make an option to insert profiles because if my granddad would buy this remote he wouldn't want to bother with all the things to do.
SPEAKER_04: Make it an option in the menu and install profiles or something.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That's a better idea.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It just has to be when it's delivered out of the store.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It has to be just simple and plain.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: If you want to install it personally.
SPEAKER_01: If I got kids and I could choose between two remote controls, one with parents controlling one without and I would buy the one with.
SPEAKER_04: I still have some questions about how to incorporate it.
SPEAKER_04: I'm thinking about some channels they cannot see but well when I think you have all the standard channels and only maybe after 10 o'clock in the evening, films and movies will come.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe some timing will be instead of channels because if you're watching I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: Or in a day cartoons will come up maybe Friday night.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe it can work with show view.
SPEAKER_03: You can control your video recorder with show view.
SPEAKER_03: When you take in the number it will start and end recording but maybe there's some option that.
SPEAKER_03: The kind of show view numbers are violent and that they are blocked out.
SPEAKER_04: Sometimes you have a phone and you have a phone that says someone who has sent all the show view numbers on the program.
SPEAKER_04: But they do the remote and that's all.
SPEAKER_01: They have a day that isn't possible.
SPEAKER_00: Well if you want to incorporate the parental control, let's say we do.
SPEAKER_00: What if a child goes up to the TV and presses up for instance?
SPEAKER_00: Nobody is stopping a child from checking the channel.
SPEAKER_04: Well you could say if a parental control is only it will go from 14 to 16 with that bad job.
SPEAKER_00: Well I'm not sure because for that to happen you'll have to receive a signal from the remote control.
SPEAKER_00: So it would be a constant signaling.
SPEAKER_00: What may be better is to incorporate a separate device that you can program with the remote control.
SPEAKER_00: And that provides parental control for instance.
SPEAKER_00: And that's just an optional device.
SPEAKER_00: Besides the remote control you will have a separate.
SPEAKER_03: I wouldn't put an optional device and that it becomes too much I think.
SPEAKER_03: If we do it we will do it in a kind of way he said like profile, parent profile, family profile.
SPEAKER_01: And you know when you install another device children can still go up to the TV, pop open the thing and.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah that's true but in the same instant same happens when you have remote control.
SPEAKER_00: The only difference is the people buying the remote control will now get the added feature of parental control.
SPEAKER_00: And those people wouldn't necessarily want it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah okay.
SPEAKER_01: But it's just an added future.
SPEAKER_03: Okay and what do you guys think of the games in the FOIS recognition?
SPEAKER_03: I personally think that that becomes too much.
SPEAKER_04: Well yeah it's more like a gadget of functionality.
SPEAKER_04: Email to from management that it's very popular to use FOIS recognition.
SPEAKER_04: But I don't think when you're watching TV and hearing loud noises from TV someone screaming, ah one and you're still chatting with each other.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah like FOIS recognition is too much I think.
SPEAKER_01: In games?
SPEAKER_01: I games.
SPEAKER_04: I can see games I can't put it on the chip anyway so.
SPEAKER_04: That doesn't it's a primary feature of the remote.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources.
SPEAKER_03: So that will that must be in it you think.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah that will be nice.
SPEAKER_03: Okay so the games are in it the FOIS recognition are not and the parental control are optional.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah it's in it but how do we do it?
SPEAKER_04: I think so.
SPEAKER_04: Well I think also it's a good idea but it's very difficult to incorporate so we should make it to complex.
SPEAKER_04: So some manual function you choose parental control and maybe FOIS will emerge when you put it on.
SPEAKER_04: But how it's going to work?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah but will there like the first idea from you can buy it without a wet parental control?
SPEAKER_03: Or are we going to put it in and just?
SPEAKER_04: I think best would be to put it in and make it in the menu option.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah to put it in always.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah and you can just when you buy it you can select the personal preference, parental control, home and capacity or something.
SPEAKER_00: Well I don't know if you had two different remote you could choose one with receiver in it.
SPEAKER_00: So you could actually easily build in parental control but it would be more expensive.
SPEAKER_00: So in that way you could make cheap moral and expensive moral.
SPEAKER_00: Could we make the simple moral, do you like moral for instance?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah but TVs aren't capable of sending.
SPEAKER_00: Yes they are.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah I thought they were just...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah you have some to receive.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah but most of them... That is true.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe you just have to restrict it to what program so the parents says you cannot watch channel 7, 9 and 10.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah and you cannot watch all channels after 10 o'clock and there's just some little clock in the middle.
SPEAKER_00: Well yeah you could easily do that after the market but you still have the problem about the television itself.
SPEAKER_04: I know it's very simple, I have seen some of the remote who have a clock in it.
SPEAKER_04: So the remote doesn't transmit when it's off the wall.
SPEAKER_01: But on the TV at least my TV is a compartment which you can press and there are buttons behind it which you can use.
SPEAKER_04: If you don't have a pool it's very blunt that's not our problem just have the parents buy it as a glue and it's not part of the remote.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah of course.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah that is true.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah you could go and like that would actually make things a lot more easy.
SPEAKER_00: You could just buy them on television.
SPEAKER_00: Make it that problem.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah I figured we could do that.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure what marketing thinks about it but...
SPEAKER_01: I have to consult my legal at first.
SPEAKER_03: Okay so I think we have decided on the things that from Janus the energy, the combination between battery and kinetic.
SPEAKER_03: The case will be double curve and rubber in a flashy fruity color.
SPEAKER_03: With cover is removable, the buttons will be touchscreen but they may not be too many buttons.
SPEAKER_03: And in the menu structure there must not be five minutes to go.
SPEAKER_03: Too many levels and it must be easy to use.
SPEAKER_03: The parental control will be incorporated but it must be not too complex and the games are in it.
SPEAKER_03: So I think we have a little more.
SPEAKER_01: Oh I have one thing left.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe for Jerome.
SPEAKER_01: The fuse.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe it's handy to build an expert view and a simple view.
SPEAKER_03: Like a mode or something.
SPEAKER_04: The expert view you have in the menu structure when you don't use it is simple.
SPEAKER_04: And when you do system properties, entire list pops up and all kind of stuff you can pull.
SPEAKER_03: It's already incorporated a little.
SPEAKER_00: You could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself for a more advanced user.
SPEAKER_00: Which buttons do you want to in it?
SPEAKER_00: You can build in a back forward button and somebody would just want to watch two channels.
SPEAKER_01: Just leave the other numbers away.
SPEAKER_00: You could have people want to.
SPEAKER_03: We take it to the other meeting.
SPEAKER_03: I went to a master class and two things can come in handy for us.
SPEAKER_03: The first thing is we talked about knowledge management, knowledge engineering and the fact that the idea of knowledge sharing and learning knowledge from other companies.
SPEAKER_03: Like that.
SPEAKER_03: It's very hot at the moment.
SPEAKER_03: So it's mostly for the management expert to look what other marketing.
SPEAKER_03: Just talking about my self.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, come on.
SPEAKER_03: What other companies had also with the marketing campaign when they put on a new remote just some import export?
SPEAKER_03: And another one?
SPEAKER_03: Benchmark.
SPEAKER_03: Benchmark.
SPEAKER_03: That's the word I saw.
SPEAKER_03: Another thing is there was a survey and it came out that people like to buy things from a single large provider instead of those who are partnering with us.
SPEAKER_03: So we must bring it as if a real reaction is a big company, a trust for company.
SPEAKER_01: I know a marketing name for it.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: R to the third power.
SPEAKER_03: R3.
SPEAKER_03: Real reaction remote.
SPEAKER_03: I had another idea to put the whole idea of a real reaction and a single brand and that kind of thing.
SPEAKER_03: When you put on the remote you see kind of just like when you're a little...
SPEAKER_03: Real reaction remote.
SPEAKER_03: With the motto we put fashion electronics and then you go...
SPEAKER_01: Okay, but it has to be like a second because you have to put in a code also.
SPEAKER_04: You can show somebody a logo for 0.5 seconds.
SPEAKER_04: They'll still remember it.
SPEAKER_03: But Linguron every time you see it.
SPEAKER_03: The idea from this thing is that we must present it as we are a single large provider who will stand on our own.
SPEAKER_00: If you have the LCD screen you can have a small logo at the bottom and you can just stay there.
SPEAKER_00: That spins around.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that spins around.
SPEAKER_03: Also, but we are...
SPEAKER_01: It's just like a globe.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's a little bit smaller.
SPEAKER_03: Think about that kind of thing.
SPEAKER_03: That's what they said in the Masterclass.
SPEAKER_03: And Shinéva.
SPEAKER_03: Next meeting starts in 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_03: So maybe you can go to Paris and Milan.
SPEAKER_01: What's again?
SPEAKER_01: Who gave you the Masterclass?
SPEAKER_01: The Masterclass.
SPEAKER_03: Ronald Batemburg.
SPEAKER_03: French Mellars.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, thanks.
SPEAKER_03: Very special.
SPEAKER_03: Next session.
SPEAKER_03: I did the industrial development session.
SPEAKER_03: Usually in the face.
SPEAKER_03: We'll work together on a prototype.
SPEAKER_03: And we'll drawing it on the smartboard.
SPEAKER_03: So that's a kind of newer thing.
SPEAKER_03: And the marketing expert will be keeping busy with the product evaluation.
SPEAKER_03: But the most specific instructions we sent to you by E-Mem.
SPEAKER_00: So we're going to work together right now?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, well, this is what I heard.
SPEAKER_03: The Masterclass.
SPEAKER_03: Not the Masterclass.
SPEAKER_03: So you just wait for the specific instructions.
SPEAKER_03: But I think it was a very good session.
SPEAKER_03: Gentlemen.
SPEAKER_03: Definitely.
SPEAKER_04: No new ones.

SPEAKER_03: See you in a half hour.
SPEAKER_03: But keep an eye on your left foot.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure if real, because I saw something about individual actions.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but there's still my instructions that you will work together.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Here or that's not my problem.
SPEAKER_03: My buy.
SPEAKER_03: So, super managers.
SPEAKER_03: The product manager always works alone.
