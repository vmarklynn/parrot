None: So....
SPEAKER_02: Bock's coming.
SPEAKER_02: 2019 o'clock, Okay now.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Hey everybody, welcome to the detailed design meeting.
SPEAKER_01: Let's see, our agenda.
SPEAKER_01: Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that.
SPEAKER_01: And I think it looks like we've come up with some ideas.
SPEAKER_01: And we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary.
SPEAKER_01: So, for later in the meeting I've done a spreadsheet of production costs.
SPEAKER_01: So we'll take a look at that and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it.
SPEAKER_01: So, actually, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You guys want to give a prototype presentation?
SPEAKER_02: Okay, well, so our design looks something like this.
SPEAKER_02: This being the wheel that you use to change channels or volume or whatever.
SPEAKER_02: So, the button serves as the power button if you hold it down and you just tap on it.
SPEAKER_02: I think it brings up the menu.
SPEAKER_02: And the base of the remote control, which has a squishy sponge you'd ever feel, is interchangeable.
SPEAKER_02: So, you can change the color according to, you know, the suit your living room or whatever.
SPEAKER_02: I can change the vegetable.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I can change the vegetable.
SPEAKER_01: It was that broccoli.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, broccoli.
SPEAKER_02: So, this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want.
SPEAKER_02: This is not to scale because it would have the battery inside it.
SPEAKER_02: It's a mango.
SPEAKER_02: It's trendy fruit.
SPEAKER_02: It's not just ordinary fruits.
SPEAKER_02: You don't have orange.
SPEAKER_02: You have mango.
SPEAKER_02: I guess strawberries, not just trans-eat.
SPEAKER_02: Very bright strawberry.
SPEAKER_02: So, we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control.
SPEAKER_02: And the people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them because they'll need to switch them up.
SPEAKER_02: It's been a little bit difficult to make sure that it's hand-holdable and that the user can use it.
SPEAKER_02: You know, it's not too big.
SPEAKER_02: But we think that this size will be okay.
SPEAKER_02: And we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow.
SPEAKER_02: And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was design yet, actually, would be the thing, the locator.
SPEAKER_02: So, the locator is just chip it inside there.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. So, that's just...
SPEAKER_02: The beeper is also inside there too, somewhere.
SPEAKER_02: So, you have to have a button on your...
SPEAKER_02: You have to attach the button to the...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we didn't design that.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we have that...
SPEAKER_02: But it would be coordinating with that.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Hit that...
SPEAKER_02: You know, match the handset.
SPEAKER_02: Get up the broccoli.
SPEAKER_02: Mango.
SPEAKER_02: Ta-da.
SPEAKER_01: If you want to look in your project documents folder, there's a Excel spreadsheet.
SPEAKER_01: The only one that's in there, production costs.
SPEAKER_01: And if you open it up, I've just stuck the numbers in.
SPEAKER_01: There's a real challenge there.
SPEAKER_01: But if I missed anything that we've gone over, or if you see something in that, it has changed.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, we decided on batteries.
SPEAKER_01: And the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button.
SPEAKER_01: I said, Uncurved or flat.
SPEAKER_01: I think that's what you have there.
SPEAKER_01: For the plastic part would be...
SPEAKER_02: My impression was that flat meant like one of the square remotes.
SPEAKER_02: But it's really not very clear.
SPEAKER_02: Because you've got single curve and double curve.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what that means.
SPEAKER_02: One side is curved and then the other side is curved.
SPEAKER_01: Well, if we're talking about the area just...
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see.
SPEAKER_01: So what else?
SPEAKER_01: There's plastic for that area around the button.
SPEAKER_01: And then rubber would be the squishy, like saying, right?
SPEAKER_01: And lots of special colors, actually.
SPEAKER_01: School wheel.
SPEAKER_01: Do you see anything that I've missed?
SPEAKER_02: No, I think that's all right.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So that would make our total of 11.9, which is...
SPEAKER_01: And less than 12.5, which means we'd be making more of a profit.
SPEAKER_01: And if we saw a lot of squishy things...
SPEAKER_01: Ooh, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
None: So...
SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
SPEAKER_01: What did you work on?
SPEAKER_02: I've got some evaluation criteria.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I've got the presentation.
SPEAKER_02: Silence.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: What happens is we have to decide whether this whole project we've been working on, and actually meet the standards we were set at the start.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: The method is...
SPEAKER_02: Well, I've analyzed the user requirements and integrated them to the TransFunding Marketing reports and in our company's strategy marketing.
SPEAKER_02: And the findings were that we needed to look in a certain way, feel in a certain way.
SPEAKER_02: And this is everything's listed down.
SPEAKER_02: Looking in a certain way, feel in a certain way.
SPEAKER_02: It has to be technologically and overtive.
SPEAKER_02: And it has to be easy to use.
SPEAKER_02: These are all things we looked at at the start.
SPEAKER_02: And criteria that have to be met.
SPEAKER_02: We have to use a table.
SPEAKER_02: I'll show you that later together to decide whether it meets the standards.
SPEAKER_02: And we have therefore in total, we have five...
SPEAKER_02: We have 11 points according to which this should be evaluated.
SPEAKER_02: And the quite...
SPEAKER_02: Well, basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria.
SPEAKER_02: I would like to show you the table we have to use.
SPEAKER_02: No? This is the table.
SPEAKER_02: Can you see this here?
SPEAKER_02: So the questions I've given you...
SPEAKER_02: Could you write that down?
SPEAKER_02: True is one and four is seven.
SPEAKER_02: And we'll just go through each point together.
SPEAKER_02: I think if each of us gives an opinion, then they can be mixed somehow.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know how it works, exactly.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I've been told...
SPEAKER_02: Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's in the...
SPEAKER_02: It's in the project documents.
SPEAKER_02: Is it meeting three minutes now?
SPEAKER_02: It's called evaluation criteria.
SPEAKER_02: And it's...
SPEAKER_02: Under evaluation.
SPEAKER_01: The PowerPoint one.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, okay, cool.
SPEAKER_02: We found that open.
SPEAKER_02: So it was...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, choose one.
SPEAKER_02: Choose one and four is seven.
SPEAKER_02: Do you want us to discuss this together?
SPEAKER_02: Do you want us to do it, sing?
SPEAKER_01: We can do it separately and then discuss it.
SPEAKER_01: If that's what people want to do.
SPEAKER_02: So it's actually a scale.
SPEAKER_01: Wait, one is true and...
SPEAKER_01: So these are the questions we're answering.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: And one is...
SPEAKER_02: If it's fancy, you put one.
SPEAKER_01: One, right.
SPEAKER_02: If it's really unfancy, it's...
SPEAKER_01: If it's somewhere in between, you put four.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, something.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Does it feel fancy?
SPEAKER_02: It feels like a video.
None: No.
SPEAKER_02: There should already be questions.
SPEAKER_02: Should be more.
None: The black two is easy to insert.
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to say yes.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Very, very true.
SPEAKER_02: I imagine there's somewhere on the front.
SPEAKER_02: There's a little case that you still don't know.
None: I'm going to say yes.
None: I'm going to say yes.
None: I'm going to say yes.
None: I'm going to say yes.
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to say yes.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_02: Unless you feel you need it.
SPEAKER_02: So, 1.1, we're just going to circle.
SPEAKER_02: 2.
SPEAKER_02: 1.5 to 13.
SPEAKER_02: So, 1 was 2 and 7 was false.
SPEAKER_01: So, we do have about the same thing.
SPEAKER_02: I was thinking 1 means no points.
SPEAKER_02: OK.
SPEAKER_02: So, starting again, 1.1.
SPEAKER_02: So, 1.2.
SPEAKER_02: 1.3.
SPEAKER_02: 1.4.
