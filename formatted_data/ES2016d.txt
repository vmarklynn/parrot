None: best yes
None: yes Okay, this is our last meeting.
SPEAKER_02: I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting and then we'll have a prototype presentation.
SPEAKER_02: Then we will do an evaluation or we'll see what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation.
SPEAKER_02: Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget.
SPEAKER_02: Then we'll do the evaluation and then we can finish up after that with the changes that we'll need to make or hopefully everything will fall right in line.
SPEAKER_02: The minutes from the last meeting, we looked at the trends.
SPEAKER_02: We had the fashion trends that people want a fancy look and feel.
SPEAKER_02: It was twice as important as anything else.
SPEAKER_02: They liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles and a spongy feel.
SPEAKER_02: So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype.
SPEAKER_02: They wanted limited buttons and simplicity.
SPEAKER_02: Then we looked at the method for coming up with our own remote, looking at other devices, the iPod.
SPEAKER_02: We really liked to look at that.
SPEAKER_02: We also had the kids remote for a simple idea, a two-part remote, which was what we originally looking at.
SPEAKER_02: Then there was tacos.
SPEAKER_02: Speech recognition becoming more predominant and easier to use.
SPEAKER_02: But I think we still decided not to go with that.
SPEAKER_02: Then we looked at the components, the materials for the case, the different energy sources, different types of chips and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote.
SPEAKER_02: And basically, what we were making for the prototype.
SPEAKER_02: So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over.
SPEAKER_04: The prototype.
SPEAKER_04: The prototype.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, do you need this?
SPEAKER_04: No.
SPEAKER_04: There you go.
SPEAKER_04: Basically, we went with the colour yellow.
SPEAKER_04: We were working on the principle of fruit, which was mentioned, it's basically designed around a banana.
SPEAKER_04: But it would be held in such a fashion where it is, obviously, it wouldn't be that floppy because this would be hard plastic.
SPEAKER_04: These would be like the rubber grips.
SPEAKER_04: So that's how hopefully we grip the ergonomics of it.
SPEAKER_04: But all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_04: To use your imagination, it's a bit.
SPEAKER_04: And this here represents the screen where you'd go through.
SPEAKER_04: And the simplest functions would be almost identical to an iPod, but that won't work through channels, that with other ethos, the volume would up and down.
SPEAKER_04: And then to access the more complicated functions, you press that and go through the menus.
SPEAKER_04: That's simple.
SPEAKER_04: That's just representally infrared beam.
SPEAKER_04: That's a simple analog switch.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: We could use the voice.
SPEAKER_04: That blue bits should be yellow.
SPEAKER_04: That'd be where the vouchers would be, I suppose.
SPEAKER_04: And that's about it.
SPEAKER_04: This is simple.
SPEAKER_04: We can make it.
SPEAKER_03: We have a plastic covered with rubber.
SPEAKER_03: We might add some more underneath here.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe give it a form.
SPEAKER_03: I'm supposed to hold them like that, but just if you grab it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's my best.
SPEAKER_03: Definitely she would.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, left handed over.
SPEAKER_03: And they're supposed exactly, you know, you might as well.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think that might be smaller.
SPEAKER_03: Think about the buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, either one on either side.
SPEAKER_02: But not doing it all.
SPEAKER_03: Just a quick one off button.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think it's pretty important.
SPEAKER_03: So you don't have to fiddle with that.
SPEAKER_03: OK.
SPEAKER_03: That's that.
SPEAKER_03: I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: You're going to play with that over there.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Nice flimsy because it's straight up heavy.
SPEAKER_04: Right.
SPEAKER_04: Just like that.
SPEAKER_01: I'm happy.
SPEAKER_02: Well done.
SPEAKER_01: Kind of a banana.
SPEAKER_04: No, whether or not it would fall to the cost of everything I suppose.
SPEAKER_04: Would they scroll and they all say they?
SPEAKER_02: Well, luckily we are going to find out.
SPEAKER_02: Or not likely.
SPEAKER_02: Do you have a marketing presentation for us?
SPEAKER_01: OK.
SPEAKER_01: You guys are going to help me do an evaluation of the criteria.
SPEAKER_01: So first, I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier.
SPEAKER_01: And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype.
SPEAKER_01: And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did.
SPEAKER_01: So the criteria we're going to be looking at are the complaints that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier.
SPEAKER_01: So we're going to be doing it based on a 7 point scale.
SPEAKER_01: And one is going to mean true that we did actually achieve that 7 being false we did not achieve that.
SPEAKER_01: So for the first one, we need to decide did we solve the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote?
SPEAKER_02: I think it's definitely different than anything else out there.
SPEAKER_02: So if they think that what is out there is ugly, then yes.
SPEAKER_02: I would say most definitely.
SPEAKER_02: It's bright.
SPEAKER_02: It's bright.
SPEAKER_02: It still has your traditional black.
SPEAKER_02: It's curved.
SPEAKER_04: It's no shop.
SPEAKER_02: Angles to it.
SPEAKER_02: Not angular.
SPEAKER_03: I'd say it comes to the ergonomics of form and stuff.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, that's definitely more beautiful than your average.
SPEAKER_03: However, the color.
SPEAKER_01: I think color is the track to us.
SPEAKER_03: So that has been dictated pretty much by the company.
SPEAKER_03: So to answer that, honestly, I would rather say we have not solved the problem completely in the remote because the color is ugly.
SPEAKER_03: Definitely.
SPEAKER_03: It's nothing you can say about that.
SPEAKER_03: I much prefer something like brushed chrome.
SPEAKER_03: That form.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, something more modern to go.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: A modern color to go with the modern form.
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_03: It's different.
SPEAKER_03: You don't want your three feet huge LCD display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with someone like that.
SPEAKER_01: OK, so do you think since we, this wasn't a sign criteria, do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle of them?
SPEAKER_01: Is that something good?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: What do you think?
SPEAKER_01: Three, four.
SPEAKER_02: I would say four.
SPEAKER_02: Four is there.
SPEAKER_02: OK.
SPEAKER_02: Very non-committal for.
SPEAKER_01: OK.
SPEAKER_01: The second one, did we make it simple for new users?
SPEAKER_03: It's very intuitive.
SPEAKER_03: I think so.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So that was the main name.
SPEAKER_04: My name is what we had.
SPEAKER_03: Do the one.
SPEAKER_03: One?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: OK.
SPEAKER_01: OK.
SPEAKER_01: And do the controls now match the operating behavior of the users?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Because we've brought it down to basically four controls where they did the most common, which are channel and volume.
SPEAKER_04: And then the other one was just a massive, just going further.
SPEAKER_04: Just scrolling further.
SPEAKER_02: Just scrolling through and selecting.
SPEAKER_00: So one.
SPEAKER_00: So that's one.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think that's one.
SPEAKER_02: OK.
None: OK.
SPEAKER_01: OK.
SPEAKER_01: The fourth one, how about the problem of a remote being easily lost, one of the number ones?
SPEAKER_03: I think that big and that yellow you just saw.
SPEAKER_03: What did you like to do in the bright end?
SPEAKER_04: But if we were to, if we were to, the speech recognition, we could maybe just use that solely for the finding thing.
SPEAKER_04: That was what we would manage.
SPEAKER_02: So if we incorporate speech recognition into it,
SPEAKER_04: then just use to find it when it was lost. But like I said, I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: You'd lose something and say, yellow, so easily.
SPEAKER_04: And it's not going to fall like a rectangle, slip down behind things.
SPEAKER_04: That's going to be a difficult shape to.
SPEAKER_02: It is quite bright.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe in the middle again, three or four.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, losing things is one of those things that people can lose.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, in a million ways, you can pick it up or walk away with it.
SPEAKER_04: And then you lost it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But if we do go with the speech recognition, then our scale goes up quite a bit.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Probably two.
SPEAKER_02: If we eliminate the fact that it's impossible to guarantee that it's not going to be lost then.
SPEAKER_02: Let's say two with speech recognition, which, of course, may be changed depending on budget.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: You could add an extra feature, actually, which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from television.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We could add that, but that's nothing we have thought of, which
SPEAKER_02: may be cheaper than speech recognition, if it were just a, yeah, true.
SPEAKER_04: But I mean, just as whistling clapping and screaming, you have that shape.
SPEAKER_04: So I can't be that.
SPEAKER_03: It's based on this anti-entie thousand sort of technology.
SPEAKER_03: They are suitcases and stuff where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage, another piece that starts beeping that can't cost much.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to hide so you have one piece.
SPEAKER_03: You have to glue somewhere behind your TV.
SPEAKER_02: You stick it behind your TV and the other.
SPEAKER_02: Pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_03: That'd be tough, though.
SPEAKER_03: Well, also your remote would alarm you if somebody stole your TV to your television.
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_03: And then you can run off to that without taking the beautiful remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So are we adding one of these two features?
SPEAKER_01: Let's add one of those features and say yes.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So we're going back to a one or two.
SPEAKER_01: Two.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Are we technologically innovative?
SPEAKER_04: I just want to show.
SPEAKER_04: I don't get my name up.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know what the controls was.
SPEAKER_04: Just screened on.
SPEAKER_04: It's all just stolen.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I thought it was.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But there's not a lot of yellow.
SPEAKER_02: There's not a lot of yellow.
SPEAKER_02: Of course, I wasn't really.
SPEAKER_02: You're kind of forced to take that color.
None: Two.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know the way we are that innovative.
SPEAKER_01: No, not true.
SPEAKER_01: But how many remote steers do you like this?
SPEAKER_02: If we added the screaming factor.
SPEAKER_02: And we go up.
SPEAKER_02: I would say we're probably up for.
SPEAKER_01: Really?
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: It's going to hurt us.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Spungy material.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we have that.
SPEAKER_01: We have some splashes.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We have some splashes sort of made you.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: It's not a one though.
SPEAKER_03: One would be the whole thing.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Because it's only got to fold.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's a good thing.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And then we have some splashes.
SPEAKER_03: These parts of the grips and perhaps the backside.
SPEAKER_02: The bottom underneath on the back.
SPEAKER_01: So that's a four.
SPEAKER_01: Probably a four at most.
SPEAKER_01: And lastly.
SPEAKER_01: Did we put the fashion in electronics?
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: If your fashion is but is Carmen Miranda?
SPEAKER_02: You betcha.
SPEAKER_03: Well, the recent fashion has rather displayed in the LCD and the way you operate it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, the form on the color, but it definitely is.
SPEAKER_03: This is what we were told.
SPEAKER_04: Let's say, definitely.
SPEAKER_04: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Now I just got a calculator.
SPEAKER_01: 17, the baddest.
SPEAKER_01: What's your baddest?
SPEAKER_04: 17.
SPEAKER_02: Seven is.
SPEAKER_02: Two point.
SPEAKER_02: Four.
None: Two point.
SPEAKER_02: Four.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I've been done math.
SPEAKER_01: What?
SPEAKER_01: I'm sure you can't wait.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, we'll say 2.42.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: How's that work?
SPEAKER_03: Press, I can't do that without a calculator.
SPEAKER_03: It's been a while.
SPEAKER_02: And what is the acceptable criteria?
SPEAKER_02: Is there like a scale that we have to hit?
SPEAKER_01: Oh, no.
SPEAKER_01: It just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it?
SPEAKER_01: Basically.
SPEAKER_02: All right, then.
SPEAKER_01: So that's that.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, well, let's see.
SPEAKER_02: Now we get to do the budget numbers.
SPEAKER_02: You didn't know that you were going to have a budget.
SPEAKER_02: But we do.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: It's been going a long time.
SPEAKER_04: I'm not 2.42.
SPEAKER_01: I said, you just keep skydiving.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So I have here 50%.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We want a 50% profit on this.
SPEAKER_02: I can't really see that very well.
SPEAKER_02: 12.5 euros is what's the cost.
SPEAKER_02: So it's too much.
SPEAKER_02: Well, let's see.
SPEAKER_02: I like this.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: So the top.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if you guys can read that enough.
SPEAKER_02: I can't sit on my glasses on.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So we've got the energy source.
SPEAKER_02: There's a four five six categories.
SPEAKER_02: We have energy source, electronics, case.
SPEAKER_02: Then we have case material supplements, interface type.
SPEAKER_02: And then button supplements.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So first of all, energy source.
SPEAKER_02: We pick battery.
SPEAKER_02: Probably some either two or four.
SPEAKER_02: Two.
None: Two.
SPEAKER_03: Like it.
SPEAKER_03: Four is going to be too heavy.
SPEAKER_03: So that's not our problem.
SPEAKER_03: People can change it every month.
SPEAKER_03: They won't go on.
SPEAKER_02: Excellent.
SPEAKER_02: They bought it.
SPEAKER_02: This is consumerism.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: So for the electronics, our choices are simple chip on print, regular chip on print, advanced chip on print, sample sensor, sample speaker.
SPEAKER_03: That's the advanced chip on print.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: We have one of those.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Then the case is a probably it's double curved.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: So the case materials are plastic, plastic.
SPEAKER_02: I guess it's two since one for the top one for the bottom.
SPEAKER_02: Is that right or is it just one?
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe it's one because of the single mode.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I guess it doesn't matter because the price on that one is zero.
SPEAKER_02: Special color.
SPEAKER_03: That's not a special color.
SPEAKER_02: The ugly color.
SPEAKER_02: Interface type.
SPEAKER_02: We have push buttons, scroll wheel interface, integrated scroll wheel push button, LCD display.
SPEAKER_02: So we actually have the LCD display.
SPEAKER_04: And then is it the integrated or?
SPEAKER_04: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Button supplements.
SPEAKER_02: Special color.
SPEAKER_02: Special form.
SPEAKER_02: Special material.
SPEAKER_03: We could of course make the buttons wood.
SPEAKER_03: Same.
SPEAKER_01: How can they?
SPEAKER_01: Really love that?
SPEAKER_01: Or titanium.
SPEAKER_01: The cost is all the same.
SPEAKER_02: But we only have one button.
SPEAKER_02: So really we shouldn't be sure.
SPEAKER_02: We shouldn't be sure.
SPEAKER_02: Anything.
SPEAKER_02: The button supplements.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I think no.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: We're going to leave that one blank because we run on LCD and scroll.
SPEAKER_02: So our total is 15.5.
SPEAKER_02: Which I believe is by three euros over.
SPEAKER_03: So we go for the hand dynamo.
SPEAKER_02: So the only thing better than if a Nana's shape remote is one that you shake.
SPEAKER_04: What if we complete and took out the one single button we've got on and just had a scroll wheel interface.
SPEAKER_04: And the LCD display.
SPEAKER_04: I suppose the LCD display is the one that's putting out.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Well, because we have to have both, right?
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And that's that's face it also depends on the software on the television.
SPEAKER_03: You can have the information of this.
SPEAKER_03: Display on the screen.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you could maybe take out the LCD display.
SPEAKER_04: Even if it comes up on the computer itself on TV itself.
SPEAKER_02: So we may not need the LCD display.
SPEAKER_04: Not as possible.
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_03: There you go.
SPEAKER_03: There we go.
SPEAKER_02: 12.5.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So we just remove our screen screen here.
SPEAKER_04: Big a dial.
SPEAKER_04: Easy to use.
SPEAKER_04: Even easy to use.
SPEAKER_02: Besides, look at what the LCD does to our lovely remote.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Back to the design room, boys.
SPEAKER_03: Take away.
SPEAKER_03: There you go.
SPEAKER_01: What's the blue part?
SPEAKER_00: That was just we got out of yellow.
SPEAKER_04: There you go.
SPEAKER_04: There you go.
SPEAKER_01: Even simpler.
SPEAKER_04: Looks more like a banana.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So costs under 12.5 euro.
SPEAKER_02: There's no.
SPEAKER_02: We redesigned it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Now it's yes.
SPEAKER_02: Next slide.
SPEAKER_02: Project evaluation.
SPEAKER_02: Project process satisfaction with, for example, room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, means, new ideas found.
SPEAKER_02: So I guess that, let's see.
SPEAKER_02: I think that perhaps the project evaluation is just supposed to be completed by me.
SPEAKER_02: But I'd like to hear your thoughts.
SPEAKER_01: Kind of fill in some time.
SPEAKER_02: What did you think of our project process?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think we don't quite well.
SPEAKER_04: We started off a little week.
SPEAKER_02: Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning.
SPEAKER_02: But as the day went along, we had more idea of what we were doing.
SPEAKER_02: Room for creativity.
SPEAKER_02: There was that.
SPEAKER_02: I think we tried a lot of different things.
SPEAKER_02: And I think it was interesting as you guys brought up more information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things.
SPEAKER_02: You guys worked together.
SPEAKER_02: Well, as a team.
SPEAKER_02: And the means.
SPEAKER_02: Which was the whiteboard and the pens.
SPEAKER_02: I had some problem with the pen.
SPEAKER_01: I think my power point.
SPEAKER_01: No, I know.
SPEAKER_03: People I work for.
SPEAKER_02: I have a list of employees that you would like fired.
SPEAKER_02: New ideas found.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, for the remote, maybe no, not for technology.
SPEAKER_02: Closing, cost are within the budget.
SPEAKER_02: Project is evaluated.
SPEAKER_02: Complete final questionnaire and meeting someone.
SPEAKER_02: That's it.
SPEAKER_02: I still have to do my minutes.
SPEAKER_02: Actually.
SPEAKER_02: So there will probably be another questionnaire coming up.
SPEAKER_02: And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can.
SPEAKER_02: What goes on after that.
SPEAKER_02: That's the end of our meeting.
None: Nancy.
None: Tyler.
None: Jeff.
