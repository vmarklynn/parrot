None: an was
SPEAKER_02: So you found your spots? Yes.
None: Blame, blame.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Where's my screen gone?
SPEAKER_00: Oh.
SPEAKER_03: Who did?
SPEAKER_03: Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_03: You have to talk in English.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: My screen is gone.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, it's called black.
SPEAKER_00: I'm afraid I'm a bit slow for this stuff.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I'm afraid I'm a bit too slow.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know how much preparation you guys did, but not a lot.
SPEAKER_02: You see this beautiful presentation.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Very nice.
SPEAKER_02: Let's get started.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I sort of prepared this.
SPEAKER_02: I'm opening acquaintance tool training, how to use the things here.
SPEAKER_02: Project plan discussion and the rest of the meeting.
SPEAKER_02: We're supposed to develop a new remote control that's both original, trendy and user-friendly.
SPEAKER_02: So I hope you have good ideas.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: We're working from top to bottom, functional design.
SPEAKER_02: And we do some individual work, new and meeting to discuss the results, et cetera, et cetera.
SPEAKER_02: And at the end of the day, we should have a prototype thrown up.
SPEAKER_02: We have available the Smartboard and the Wideboard.
SPEAKER_02: We should take some practice.
SPEAKER_02: We have some instructions now to do that.
SPEAKER_02: How to document work.
SPEAKER_02: This is for toolbar.
SPEAKER_02: Next, we have a pen.
SPEAKER_02: And we can use this pen to perform expressions.
SPEAKER_02: So it doesn't always work.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so you can draw.
SPEAKER_02: Draw.
SPEAKER_01: Draw.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: And in the format menu, you can select color and line width, et cetera, et cetera.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Each of you can take some practice and you should draw an animal.
SPEAKER_02: And you should explain with different colors and with different pen widths.
SPEAKER_02: And you should explain why you draw that particular animal.
SPEAKER_02: So you're in.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Don't take up too much space.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Different pen widths.
SPEAKER_03: How do you do that?
SPEAKER_02: With the format menu.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Use different colors, et cetera.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: What's that supposed to be?
SPEAKER_01: Should it be one?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah, four left.
SPEAKER_00: It's the rough yellow.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it needs some yellow.
SPEAKER_01: Can you use one blank sheet burr drawing?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So he must save it at the end.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you can press the next button, which is.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, in the file option.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: In file menu.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: No, you can do it.
SPEAKER_03: How much time do we have to draw anyway?
SPEAKER_03: I can take forever on this.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, do I have to explain why it chose this animal?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's a great animal.
SPEAKER_00: It's a giraffe.
SPEAKER_00: How'd you guess?
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's more like a dinosaur.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: I will give it an eye.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
None: That's nice of you.
SPEAKER_00: Hey, come on.
SPEAKER_00: So leave to eat.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Pretty good.
SPEAKER_01: Could you press the next?
SPEAKER_01: The next.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: That'll do.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Thanks.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Is this part of our acquaintance or introduction?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, introduction.
SPEAKER_02: Get acquainted.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: That's the idea.
SPEAKER_03: Here, lime broke.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: All right.
SPEAKER_01: That's fast.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I see.
SPEAKER_01: This is the spot.
SPEAKER_00: Keep depression.
SPEAKER_01: I'm guessing a turtle.
SPEAKER_01: I say good gas.
SPEAKER_03: I'm guessing a turtle.
SPEAKER_01: I say good gas.
SPEAKER_02: Why a turtle?
SPEAKER_03: Because of its shell.
SPEAKER_01: Because it's slow.
SPEAKER_01: It's slow.
SPEAKER_01: You were slow too?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I was a bit slow too.
SPEAKER_01: Dude, you're a good drawer.
SPEAKER_01: Some other lime.
SPEAKER_03: Do you have a turtle pet?
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Does it have legs?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it looks exactly legs, but...
SPEAKER_03: Stop it, stop.
SPEAKER_01: It's more like a tank.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's fins, but I don't know where.
SPEAKER_03: They kind of look like mold legs.
SPEAKER_03: What's sharp nails?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Some spots.
SPEAKER_01: Some eye.
SPEAKER_01: It's a friendly turtle, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, well, I think it's fair enough.
SPEAKER_03: A little tail, maybe?
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what position is.
SPEAKER_01: Does it have ears?
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: Can you erase ears?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: A gum.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_02: Eraser.
SPEAKER_03: And why did you choose this animal?
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: It just came into my mind.
SPEAKER_01: There's no particular reason.
SPEAKER_01: It's like a pen.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you like it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I'm guessing I'm done.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: That's my turtle.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: How to select the next?
SPEAKER_01: Here.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: There you go.
SPEAKER_03: Colors were under format, all right?
SPEAKER_03: Let's see.
SPEAKER_03: How am I going to do this?
SPEAKER_02: I read it.
SPEAKER_02: Gengaroo.
SPEAKER_03: Not quite, actually.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Fire.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: 8.
SPEAKER_03: It's a cat.
SPEAKER_03: It's a cat.
SPEAKER_01: Not a cat, but an accident.
SPEAKER_02: Why a cat?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: They're my favorite bats.
SPEAKER_02: You have some.
SPEAKER_03: I have a color already.
SPEAKER_03: I'm not so good at drawing with this kind of stuff.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, shit.
SPEAKER_02: I'm the pet.
SPEAKER_03: Excuse my language.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know how to draw a face, but you get the idea.
SPEAKER_03: It's my favorite pet animal.
SPEAKER_03: Because they're cute, they're independent, and cuddly.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: That's it.
SPEAKER_03: Or do I need to use more colors?
SPEAKER_02: I think it's okay.
SPEAKER_02: Get ID.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: We have a financial aspect to this project.
SPEAKER_02: We can sell them at 25 euros.
SPEAKER_02: The aim is to reach to sell as much as 50 million euros.
SPEAKER_02: That's quite a big amount of money.
SPEAKER_02: And the production cost should be the half of the selling price.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Now it's time for some discussion.
SPEAKER_02: Let's take it.
None: Two.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: What do you want to discuss?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We should get started.
SPEAKER_02: I'm taking notes.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: We each have a specific task, as I saw in my mill.
SPEAKER_02: I didn't know if you received the same mill.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I guess so.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So the industry, industry designer, should produce a working design.
SPEAKER_02: Am I correct?
SPEAKER_03: Two.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: The user interface, these are the shoots, specified a technical functions.
SPEAKER_02: Right?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And the marketing experts should come up with user requirements.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Did any of you already do some work on this part?
SPEAKER_03: Well, I started making an overview for myself what I had to do.
SPEAKER_03: Because we have three design steps.
SPEAKER_03: And in every step I have a specific task to perform or whatever.
SPEAKER_03: So I had to, I don't know, make an overview for myself about what I have to do and kind of let it work in to get ideas about how I have to fill the ideas.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I started with the first phase, I think, was the functional.
SPEAKER_03: And let's see.
SPEAKER_03: I had to focus on the working design, which you said.
SPEAKER_03: How does the apparatus work?
SPEAKER_03: Well, I basically had two points.
SPEAKER_03: According to the coffee machine example, I have batteries to supply energy and we use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the TV.
SPEAKER_03: And that's basically all I have so far.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I got another point.
SPEAKER_02: I had to use infrared light to communicate the signal to the device.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So that's very common.
SPEAKER_00: I had some buttons for the ON and OFF function.
SPEAKER_00: You already told that.
SPEAKER_00: And for the changing to all the channels and changing the volume.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: The basic options for remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I kept it global because that it activates the deactivate specific functions.
SPEAKER_03: I wasn't thinking yet about that.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, you wanted to fill the channel, but you might want to use tail text also.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know what the word is in English.
SPEAKER_02: So you might leave.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: What did the marketing expert do?
SPEAKER_01: Well, from a marketing perspective, well, the function design phase consists of the user requirements.
SPEAKER_01: What needs and desires are to be fulfilled.
SPEAKER_01: So there are a few means to reach that by doing research.
SPEAKER_01: To see what existing products are there out in the market.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, what functions do they have?
SPEAKER_01: Especially what are their shortcomings?
SPEAKER_01: Are there any new functions which can be added to our product?
SPEAKER_01: Well, we have to do some internet search, for example, for what kind of applications do current remote control support?
SPEAKER_01: And what are future of current and future televisions?
SPEAKER_01: So we can see what needs to be supported.
SPEAKER_01: And we can interview current users and future users.
SPEAKER_01: What would they like to see on a new remote control?
SPEAKER_01: Especially for future users, I'm thinking of early adopters.
SPEAKER_01: Because they use new technology first.
SPEAKER_01: And they play with a lot of tools and stuff.
SPEAKER_01: So maybe they have some good ideas to add.
SPEAKER_02: And you can get that information?
SPEAKER_01: I think I can get that information.
SPEAKER_02: That's a very handy.
SPEAKER_02: But have you any ideas so far as what do the user requirements are?
SPEAKER_01: No, not specifically more to how to get them.
SPEAKER_00: I got some requirements.
SPEAKER_00: It has to be user friendly.
SPEAKER_00: Really easy to use buttons.
SPEAKER_00: Not very small buttons.
SPEAKER_00: But also the big, big buttons.
SPEAKER_00: But just normal buttons.
SPEAKER_00: There's to be a small unit.
SPEAKER_00: You can take it with you everywhere in your house.
SPEAKER_00: So it has to be a gigantic machine.
SPEAKER_00: And a good zapping range.
SPEAKER_02: What do you mean by that?
SPEAKER_00: The distance from your television to your remote control has to be quite a big distance.
SPEAKER_00: It has to be capable for a zapping.
SPEAKER_01: From the other end of the room or something.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment.
SPEAKER_02: I think the best is to go to...
SPEAKER_03: Is that you?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: All right.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Any more points to discuss?
SPEAKER_02: I think we can go ahead with what we have.
SPEAKER_02: I will summarize the things we discussed and put it in the project folder.
SPEAKER_02: Use the industrial designer can work on the working design, etc. etc.
SPEAKER_02: And it seems you get more information by email.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: It was it for me.
SPEAKER_01: Thanks.
SPEAKER_00: Are you going to put the notes on the project folder?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: Writing very fast.
SPEAKER_02: How is readable?
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So, do we have more to add to the discussion?
SPEAKER_03: Well, no, I'm just a bit wondering what we're going to do the next.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Do we only have to do a phase one, the functional design?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And after that, we are going to the conceptual...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We're just working in three phases.
SPEAKER_02: We need a future work.
SPEAKER_02: We have a meeting, a future work meeting.
SPEAKER_02: And at the end of the day, we have the final meeting.
SPEAKER_02: And then I have to prepare.
SPEAKER_02: I have to defend our design.
SPEAKER_02: So, make it good.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: We'll do our best.
SPEAKER_02: Better make it good.
SPEAKER_03: I am going to work on the conceptual design already.
SPEAKER_03: Because it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in.
SPEAKER_03: Do we...
SPEAKER_03: I mean, is it going to be a multimedia control center?
SPEAKER_03: Do we want to be able to use the video recording?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's my question also, because like new functions...
SPEAKER_02: That is the user requirements.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And do they want all those functions?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But we need good communication about this stuff.
SPEAKER_03: Because I have to put the components into the design.
SPEAKER_00: So, if I don't know what the components are, I was kind of...
SPEAKER_00: I think we have first to start with the basic functions.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: We can...
SPEAKER_01: Well, like some...
SPEAKER_01: Like some...
SPEAKER_01: Some remotes were out there, which I know there is one button, which is very easy to switch between devices.
SPEAKER_01: So, you can switch to your video and then the same buttons, control your video.
SPEAKER_01: And another function, I think, of switch to your media center, because it's getting very popular.
SPEAKER_01: And then use your Windows Media Center under your TV with the same remote control.
SPEAKER_01: So, with the switch, one single switch.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I know what you mean, but you will need several other buttons for a video player.
SPEAKER_03: You need to play and fast forward and stuff like that.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and you don't need that for the TV.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: And for...
SPEAKER_03: Title text.
SPEAKER_03: You need additional buttons as well.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I'll just put my ideas in here.
SPEAKER_03: And then we can...
SPEAKER_03: This project...
SPEAKER_03: The next...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We could just start with the assumption that's only for TV and video.
SPEAKER_02: And then we reserve the possibility to add all the features.
SPEAKER_02: So, you have a basic starting point and you can always extend that.
SPEAKER_02: So, make sure it's extendable.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It has to be user friendly.
SPEAKER_00: So, it's...
SPEAKER_00: It's...
SPEAKER_02: The least amount of functions possible.
SPEAKER_02: So, it's easier to get to know how it works.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I'll see you again when the computer tells us to.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Half an hour.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You're the...
SPEAKER_02: The business.
SPEAKER_02: You're fired.
SPEAKER_01: Not yet.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Let's move on.
SPEAKER_02: Let's see what we've got to do.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
None: See you later.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: See you later.
SPEAKER_03: Good luck.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: Well, good luck.
SPEAKER_03: What the...
None: Oh, yeah.
