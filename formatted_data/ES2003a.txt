SPEAKER_02: Okay, well I think we're ready to begin.
SPEAKER_02: Right, my name's Adnjogged, we're here because of real reaction.
SPEAKER_02: We have a new group.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, Ebenezer, Ademisoye.
SPEAKER_01: You like to support it?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, go for it.
SPEAKER_02: Any Z.
SPEAKER_02: Any Z.
SPEAKER_02: E-R.
SPEAKER_01: Ebenezer, and you're ruled as?
SPEAKER_01: I'm the marketing expert.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Next we have TireGrammer, T-A-R-I-K, T-R-I-K.
SPEAKER_04: And your rule in this is?
SPEAKER_02: Industrial designer, industrial designer.
SPEAKER_02: And lastly we have Dave Kachren.
SPEAKER_02: And you're going to be the user interface.
SPEAKER_02: Right, this is the agenda for today's meeting.
SPEAKER_02: As you can see, we're opening acquaintance, tool training, project plan, discussion, and closing.
SPEAKER_02: We already got through opening and partially through acquaintance.
SPEAKER_02: So the reason we're here, we're going to design a new remote control, as you probably all know.
SPEAKER_02: The very broad overview is original, trendy, and user friendly.
SPEAKER_02: Of course, we'll have to go into a bit more detail in that.
SPEAKER_02: But personally, I think that the original is going to be a very key aspect of this design.
SPEAKER_02: There's a lot of remote controls out there anyway, so we're going to need something that's really going to set it apart.
SPEAKER_02: This is how today seems to be going to work.
SPEAKER_02: Now the three-k faces, as you've probably already been told, the functional, conceptual, and the detailed design.
SPEAKER_02: The first one is going to be covering the user requirements spec, technical functions, working design.
SPEAKER_02: Second, seems to be conceptual components, properties, materials.
SPEAKER_02: And the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far.
SPEAKER_02: Of course, you've all got the similar emails, I believe.
None: What can I say?
SPEAKER_02: Every user?
SPEAKER_02: Do you want to draw your favorite animal?
SPEAKER_02: Sure.
SPEAKER_00: Whiteboard.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I'll make this quick since we don't have much time.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So it's not the best picture in the world.
SPEAKER_01: Also, elephants have a very good memory, much like myself.
SPEAKER_01: And I can't remember back when I used to live in Nigeria, but I think I used to have a pet elephant.
SPEAKER_01: So elephants are big, strong, and gentle, and they have great memories, and they began to let it eat, just like I've been using.
SPEAKER_02: Brilliantly done.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: Do you like to have a shot at the artistry?
SPEAKER_04: Oh, I'm going to take it to your belt.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I think you should also have your little pal mic on as well.
None: Oh, that's good.
SPEAKER_01: We can clip them on.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, there's this microphone as well.
SPEAKER_01: Just somewhere.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's just across here.
None: Yep.
SPEAKER_03: This is what's we clip?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I'll follow you if you.
SPEAKER_02: There you go.
SPEAKER_02: You probably just stick it in your pocket for now.
SPEAKER_02: I wouldn't worry too much.
SPEAKER_02: I'm just going to go back and do it.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I'm destroying your outfit there.
None: Yeah, I'm just going to go back and do it.
None: Yeah, I'm just going to go back and do it.
None: Yeah, I'm just going to go back and do it.
SPEAKER_04: All right, here we have a tiger.
SPEAKER_04: I was love tigers.
SPEAKER_04: They're big, they're big as cats.
SPEAKER_04: They're a project on cats of the wild and as a kid.
SPEAKER_04: It was my favourite cat just because it looks the best.
SPEAKER_04: The stripes are orange.
SPEAKER_04: My dad used to talk about it.
SPEAKER_04: He's from Bangladesh.
SPEAKER_04: I used to tell me how bad the money is.
SPEAKER_04: That was a kid.
SPEAKER_04: They're just the most ferocious animals in the wild.
SPEAKER_04: That's why I like them.
SPEAKER_04: It doesn't say I'm going to let me really pull.
SPEAKER_02: Excellent.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you, right?
SPEAKER_02: I love you if you'd like to have a dash.
None: Thank you.
None: Thank you.
None: Thank you.
None: Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
None: Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: I'll call the best drone in the world, but it'll be for now.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not quite as feared as your average tiger, but cats are one of my favourite animals.
SPEAKER_02: What can you say?
SPEAKER_02: You've got all of those qualities in an animal.
SPEAKER_02: We've all managed to master the whiteboard there.
SPEAKER_02: So, on to project finance.
SPEAKER_02: As you can see, 12.5 euros per unit.
SPEAKER_02: That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware.
SPEAKER_02: We're hoping to sell them for 25.
SPEAKER_02: If we're aiming for 50 million euros, we're going to have to be selling an awful lot of them.
SPEAKER_01: That was a property.
SPEAKER_02: That's the amount made.
SPEAKER_02: 50 million, and if you're making 12.5 euros in each one, then awful lot need to be sold.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Now we better just get on with the meat of the project.
SPEAKER_02: So, I'm going to guess that we've all used remote controls.
SPEAKER_02: Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market?
SPEAKER_03: Well, the thing I'm aware of is that there are a very high price end of the market.
SPEAKER_03: There's emerging markets such as touch screen, LCD remote.
SPEAKER_03: There can be programmed in much more sophisticated ways, conventional models.
SPEAKER_03: So, you can redesign the interface to your own needs.
SPEAKER_03: You can program in macros and you get a much greater degree.
SPEAKER_03: When you get these three and one five normal transfers, but you can get integration between the different things that is designed to control too much greater extent.
SPEAKER_03: You can have one macro to turn the TV to the right channel, rewind the tape and the VCR and get it to play what's this rewind, for instance.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: It occurs to me there might be a niche for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality, but using a conventional push button design.
SPEAKER_03: And therefore putting it into a much lower price bracket.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, that's true. With the price range we're looking at going for a touch screen would probably possibly be a bit.
SPEAKER_02: But you think again, something to control multiple units in a simple fashion.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I mean, I see you get ones that you can switch between multiple units, but something that could operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion.
SPEAKER_03: And I did something into which would you have some at least limited facility for running macros.
SPEAKER_02: Would it be ideal something along the lines of one on button would turn on say the video recorded the TV, maybe the sound system as well on one go.
SPEAKER_03: For instance, I say, or you press say the play button for the DVD player and it turns the TV on and on to the right channel as well.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, that sounds like a good strong idea.
SPEAKER_02: Any takes this.
SPEAKER_01: I've noticed that gaming becoming quite popular with television.
SPEAKER_01: When I was younger we used to play games using our cable using the cable subscribe cable providers.
SPEAKER_01: But our remote controls get worn out really easily.
SPEAKER_01: And the remote controls not a great kind of keyboard keypad for playing games.
SPEAKER_01: So perhaps one that was more specialized for game playing or interactive television.
SPEAKER_01: They recently brought out this new remote control for people to sit their favorite channels to record things.
SPEAKER_01: Instead of people entering in what time things start, you simply start a slide of bar to say what time it begins and slide a never bar to say what time it ends.
SPEAKER_02: Do you have heard I've seen the barcode design before?
SPEAKER_01: It's taken out the you don't have to be really clever to use the remote control.
SPEAKER_01: I think the gaming you know you want you want some big buttons for up down left and right shoot.
SPEAKER_01: You want to be able to change angles and interactive television.
SPEAKER_01: So you need buttons to change the television angle.
SPEAKER_01: The camera angles and stuff like that.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, well we're beginning to run out of time now. So we've got a couple of ideas we can.
SPEAKER_02: We'll have to work fast.
SPEAKER_02: All right, as you can see we've got 30 minutes until the next meeting.
SPEAKER_02: So we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality.
SPEAKER_02: How the user interface might work. That'll be a key aspect, especially if the idea of some kind of macro facility because you have to program it.
SPEAKER_02: You have to have a lot of response back or at least some kind.
SPEAKER_02: And we're going to maybe try and have to figure out what the user wants.
SPEAKER_02: What the user wants. Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Right. Has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage?
SPEAKER_02: Anything you think that might have been missed so far?
SPEAKER_04: When you talk about gaming, do you think they should have some sort of stick on it rather than the.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, that's like control that's you know of games for.
SPEAKER_04: Reset that ridiculous.
SPEAKER_02: I don't see why not almost everybody's probably used to a console by now and all of them incorporate small.
SPEAKER_02: Deep ads on them. In fact, even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well.
SPEAKER_02: It's probably an interface that most people are used to.
SPEAKER_02: And that could allow easy navigation users as a joystick as well.
SPEAKER_03: And the other key feature that would be a good idea of building it is to make something fairly ergonomic.
SPEAKER_03: Fits as comfortably as possible into the hand.
SPEAKER_03: Of course, it also allows for the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional attractive shape for it overall.
SPEAKER_02: So small stylish and something that is a little bit different slightly sort of biomorphic and form.
SPEAKER_03: Which it would need to be to sort of conform for the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, that's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily.
SPEAKER_02: I would hope so anyway.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: I'd say we finish this one up, we'll get started. I'll write up what we've kind of quickly done.
SPEAKER_02: And I'll get it out to everybody.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Very good.
SPEAKER_02: As far as I'm aware, we leave the microphones here.
SPEAKER_02: So we're going to talk about why we need to stick a laptop for this.
