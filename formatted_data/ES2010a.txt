SPEAKER_00: Let's do it.
SPEAKER_00: So to start writing on here, do you have to start by pressing anything on this page?
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I filled a buzz.
SPEAKER_01: Me too.
SPEAKER_01: That's cool.
None: Okay.
None: Hi everybody.
SPEAKER_00: Welcome to our kickoff meeting for our new product that we're going to be designing.
SPEAKER_00: I'm Mandy and I'm the project manager and I know all your names again.
SPEAKER_00: Courtney.
SPEAKER_00: Yep.
SPEAKER_00: Vanilla and Amber.
SPEAKER_00: Alright.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So first, let's go through this PowerPoint.
SPEAKER_00: I wonder what button I press.
SPEAKER_03: Let's do it on our own.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Or how about I just click?
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Here's our agenda for this meeting.
SPEAKER_00: We're going to start with our opening which was our introductions.
SPEAKER_00: We're going to get to know each other a little bit better.
SPEAKER_00: Tool training.
SPEAKER_00: We're going to, I guess, figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles.
SPEAKER_00: We're going to make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Here's our project.
SPEAKER_00: We're going to make a new remote control that's original, trendy and also user-friendly.
SPEAKER_00: And how we're going to do it is each of us is going to, we're going to have discussed the functional design first.
SPEAKER_00: How is it going to be used?
SPEAKER_00: What's the actual goal here?
SPEAKER_00: It has to operate the TV bubble, and we're going to do individual work on that and then meet the same thing with conceptual design, just the base overview of the project.
SPEAKER_00: And then we're going to do individual work.
SPEAKER_00: That's pretty much the whole process for today.
SPEAKER_00: And then the detailed design, just more in depth, get the actual schematics of the remote.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: All right.
SPEAKER_00: First, we're going to start off by using our tools.
SPEAKER_00: And the whiteboard thing, do you guys want to give that a try, even though the ink wasn't working?
SPEAKER_00: Or do you want to do it on here?
SPEAKER_02: I think we should forego the whiteboards since we can't actually see what we're writing
SPEAKER_00: on. We can do it on here.
SPEAKER_00: All right.
SPEAKER_00: Let's go forward then.
SPEAKER_00: So we're all going to draw our favorite animal and then sum up our favorite characteristics of that animal.
SPEAKER_00: Even if you're not a good driver like me.
SPEAKER_00: All right.
SPEAKER_02: Just excuse me.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_00: Let's see.
None: I have things.
SPEAKER_01: Let's see.
SPEAKER_02: I draw like I'm in grade five.
SPEAKER_02: So we'll do that.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, about one more minute.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I'd like to start off.
SPEAKER_01: I'll go.
SPEAKER_01: This is my picture.
SPEAKER_01: I drew fish.
SPEAKER_01: I like fish because, you know, they're a whole water vascular system thing.
SPEAKER_01: It's pretty cool.
SPEAKER_01: They've got a pretty good habitat and they're pretty sometimes, sometimes fishes, but that's okay.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, only if they're piranhas.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, they're easy, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: All right.
SPEAKER_00: You want to go next?
SPEAKER_02: I'll go.
SPEAKER_02: I drew a kitty.
SPEAKER_02: It's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat.
SPEAKER_01: No, I love cats.
SPEAKER_02: No, I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: I love cats.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it does look like a cat.
SPEAKER_02: I love cats because they're independent.
SPEAKER_02: They pretty much know what they want.
SPEAKER_02: They get it.
SPEAKER_02: They move on.
None: I love cats too.
SPEAKER_00: I'm a cat person.
SPEAKER_00: I'm allergic to cats.
SPEAKER_01: I'm allergic to cats too.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_00: If you're around when I had a roommate who was allergic, but if she was around my cat forever, she became used to it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you know, if you're around the full one, pretty tight.
SPEAKER_01: I still can't sleep with them in my room.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: This summer, I love cats.
SPEAKER_01: It's crazy.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I drew a badger.
SPEAKER_03: Cool.
SPEAKER_00: I drew a badger.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Good choice.
SPEAKER_03: Why badger?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: They're grumpy and mocked her and all.
SPEAKER_03: Are you trying to suggest something?
SPEAKER_03: Well, a little bit like the...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And then, she knew when to do a badger.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And then, I don't know if she know Brian Jacques.
SPEAKER_03: He's a little puddling rider.
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_03: Sounded us from, like, a red wall.
SPEAKER_03: That kind of looks badger school and that one too.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: And I'm last.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Look at my sad sad giraffe.
SPEAKER_00: No, it's good.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no.
SPEAKER_00: It ends up looking like some kind of dinosaur, but whatever.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know even much about giraffes, but I just love the way they look.
SPEAKER_00: They're just such odd creatures, you know?
SPEAKER_00: I like that they're so unique and individual.
SPEAKER_00: I guess.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know much about their behavior or anything, though.
SPEAKER_00: I want to see a couple of what they really have to.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: You can like the way they look.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
None: All right.
SPEAKER_00: I guess we're getting straight back into business here.
SPEAKER_00: The selling price for our remote is going to be 25 euro.
SPEAKER_00: And our profit aim is 50 million euro.
SPEAKER_00: We're going to make this an international product marketed in the states, in Europe, in Asia.
SPEAKER_00: And our production costs to make that profit is going to be a max of 1250 euro per remote.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So we're going to talk for a little while.
SPEAKER_00: Here are some topics that we might be able to discuss.
SPEAKER_00: Our experiences with remote controls are first ideas about this new remote.
SPEAKER_00: Anything that you can bring to the table for this project.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: You want to start us off?
SPEAKER_00: Anybody have anything to offer?
SPEAKER_02: Well, we want to make a multifunctional remote, right?
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: One remote for everything.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_03: We have what sounds system, TV, DVD, VHS.
SPEAKER_03: I think they'll be facing VHS-T, though.
SPEAKER_03: But it's still there, so it's pot.
SPEAKER_03: We're going to do it.
SPEAKER_01: It needs to be compatible because universal remote controls are never universal.
SPEAKER_01: They're never universal.
SPEAKER_00: That's right.
SPEAKER_00: Especially if you buy a not big product DVD player, say, usually it doesn't work if it's not one of them.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, it's so obvious.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So we're going to have to figure out how to cover all the different variances in signals.
SPEAKER_01: And we need an insanely good instruction booklet because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways.
SPEAKER_00: OK. And another thing that I think is important is the design of the product, how it feels in your hand.
SPEAKER_00: If it's just flat and kind of boring, those don't, nobody wants to buy those anymore.
SPEAKER_00: They want the ergonomic ones.
SPEAKER_00: They want like the flashy ones.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So like this keeps on.
SPEAKER_00: This is the biggest ones that look high tech, too.
SPEAKER_03: But at the same time, I'm so lucky.
SPEAKER_00: Right.
SPEAKER_02: So that people with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand.
SPEAKER_00: Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that?
SPEAKER_00: There's fast ones.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: That's true.
SPEAKER_02: What kind of battery would we want to use?
SPEAKER_02: Because battery changing is usually double A.
SPEAKER_02: OK.
SPEAKER_01: Do some of them use triple A's though?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Some use triple A's.
SPEAKER_01: So double or triple?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I guess that is.
SPEAKER_03: We need to do triple A.
SPEAKER_03: We can, but most people usually have the only surround.
SPEAKER_00: OK.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But that has to do with the size of it, too.
SPEAKER_00: Well, as long as we know that issue is, if we wanted to be more thin, then we'd probably want to go with a triple A.
SPEAKER_01: Could you go with a small lithium battery?
SPEAKER_00: It's OK.
SPEAKER_00: We don't have to decide about it now just as long as we remember battery type and size is important.
SPEAKER_00: OK.
SPEAKER_00: Anything else?
SPEAKER_00: All right.
SPEAKER_00: Move along.
SPEAKER_00: Oh.
SPEAKER_00: We're closing the meeting.
SPEAKER_00: Next meeting is going to start in 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_00: Here's what we're going to do.
SPEAKER_00: The ID, which is who?
SPEAKER_00: OK.
SPEAKER_00: You're going to think about the working design.
SPEAKER_00: What do you think of it?
SPEAKER_00: OK.
SPEAKER_00: And you ID.
SPEAKER_00: The technical functions design, making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do, the functionality of it, operating all those different things.
SPEAKER_00: OK.
SPEAKER_00: And the marketing person, Courtney, is going to do the user requirements specification.
SPEAKER_00: I guess that means specifying what exactly the user is going to be looking for.
SPEAKER_00: Right?
SPEAKER_00: Right.
SPEAKER_00: I would think so.
SPEAKER_00: OK.
SPEAKER_00: And you're going to get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while.
SPEAKER_00: OK.
SPEAKER_00: So does anybody have anything they want to say before closing the meeting?
SPEAKER_00: OK.
SPEAKER_00: This meeting is officially over.
