SPEAKER_00: Okay, everyone's ready.
SPEAKER_00: So we are here for our functional design.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. So we are here for the functional design meeting.
SPEAKER_00: So first I will show the agenda.
SPEAKER_00: So I will take notes during this meeting.
SPEAKER_00: So I will try to summarize it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards.
SPEAKER_00: So then each of you will lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time.
SPEAKER_00: So user requirements, specification, technical function design and working design.
SPEAKER_00: Then I will present you some new project requirements I received from the management board.
SPEAKER_00: Then we will take the decision on the remote control needed functions.
SPEAKER_00: And then I will assign you to task for the next part of the meeting of the process.
SPEAKER_00: So we want to start the presentation of what they do.
SPEAKER_01: Do you want to start?
SPEAKER_03: You can start.
SPEAKER_03: You have a PowerPoint.
SPEAKER_03: It should be in the folder, no?
SPEAKER_00: I am maybe there.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Where are you?
SPEAKER_03: I'm Triasnick.
SPEAKER_00: Ouch.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: There is a technical problem.
SPEAKER_03: Do you think we said it in the wrong folder?
SPEAKER_03: It was somewhere in something like this.
SPEAKER_03: I don't remember the name.
SPEAKER_01: What do you have in short?
SPEAKER_01: Go up.
SPEAKER_01: But it's been two.
SPEAKER_03: Go up.
SPEAKER_03: Again?
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: We will back.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe we have to enter the RAM.
SPEAKER_03: We have to enter.
SPEAKER_03: Over?
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: No, there is nothing.
SPEAKER_00: There is no...
SPEAKER_00: We have a technical problem.
SPEAKER_01: Otherwise, could you just describe by hand?
SPEAKER_01: With the whiteboard.
SPEAKER_00: If you remember, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Basically, what we want here is remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Of course, we want to control.
SPEAKER_03: Most people want to have a remote for the high-fi and TV and stuff like that.
SPEAKER_03: But other people want also remote for controlling toys like robotic pets and robots and stuff.
SPEAKER_03: Other people also want to have remote for controlling the whole house.
SPEAKER_03: There is a project called X-Houd or something like that.
SPEAKER_03: You can integrate your remote with computers and stuff.
SPEAKER_03: There is one thing.
SPEAKER_03: The other thing is the finder feature by Wistling or whatever.
SPEAKER_03: If you have the finder feature, then you can also have, at the same time, any general Wist commands.
SPEAKER_03: If you want.
SPEAKER_03: I think it should be a packet in that case.
SPEAKER_03: Usually, the Facebook consists of two parts.
SPEAKER_03: One is the voice command.
SPEAKER_03: The one is the actual buttons part.
SPEAKER_03: The buttons part would be a set of buttons for choosing devices.
SPEAKER_03: A set of buttons for special navigation in space.
SPEAKER_03: A set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access.
SPEAKER_01: What do you mean by linear access?
SPEAKER_03: Video tape goes forward backwards, fast and stuff.
SPEAKER_00: Special navigation, linear access, random access and there is a false one.
SPEAKER_00: The button is for special navigation.
SPEAKER_03: For special navigation, you might have a TV in the menu and you will say yes.
SPEAKER_00: Linear access, random access.
SPEAKER_03: Parameter.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, Parameter.
SPEAKER_03: If there are common parameters, maybe you could use special buttons for that.
SPEAKER_03: Or maybe you could have everything generic.
SPEAKER_03: But there are a lot of remotes on the market right now.
SPEAKER_03: Basically, most of everybody has this stuff.
SPEAKER_00: And voice command, did you...
SPEAKER_03: Was command you could specify and think you could assign any button to any button.
SPEAKER_03: If you have enough processing power, I guess.
SPEAKER_00: So that closes your investigations.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think so.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with...
SPEAKER_04: I don't know if you can open this.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if I can open this.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe you can...
SPEAKER_04: It's not here.
SPEAKER_04: It's in...
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: It's in here.
SPEAKER_04: A document.
SPEAKER_04: I think we can open it.
SPEAKER_00: In which folder?
SPEAKER_04: Here.
SPEAKER_00: Shortcut to maybe...
SPEAKER_05: But it's not there.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe you can send it to me by email.
SPEAKER_00: Just to participate one.
SPEAKER_04: Add Ami.
SPEAKER_00: I'm trying to show it to everyone.
SPEAKER_00: That would be more comfortable.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: You send it?
SPEAKER_04: It's participant one.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: This is this email.
SPEAKER_03: I'm designing it.
None: It's in my face.
None: Okay.
None: You can.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So maybe I can switch slides whenever you ask.
SPEAKER_00: That would be more convenient.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: You can go.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: In how our usability lab, we observed the remote control use among 100 subjects.
SPEAKER_04: And the subject also filled a questionnaire.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: And here are the results.
SPEAKER_04: So you can see that the 25% of users find most remote controls ugly.
SPEAKER_04: So we have to find something to make them more nice, more kind.
SPEAKER_04: 80% of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy.
SPEAKER_04: 80% of users would spend more money when a remote control would look...
SPEAKER_04: Oh, it's not good.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: It's not really interesting.
SPEAKER_04: I can say, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: 75% of users say they zap a lot.
SPEAKER_04: We have to have a remote control very hard for that.
SPEAKER_04: The buttons have to be...
SPEAKER_04: Like you say, resisting to shocks.
SPEAKER_04: And 50% of users say they only use 10% of the buttons in the remote control.
SPEAKER_04: So all the buttons we have to have to use a real use and not to...
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So if you have buttons, maybe you can be good.
SPEAKER_04: Not many buttons and you use the above buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: But what kind of remote controls do you have?
SPEAKER_03: Sorry?
SPEAKER_03: I have to use the above buttons.
SPEAKER_04: It's a TV.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Most of it is a TV.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but in fact, it seems that we are going to make a TV remote control.
SPEAKER_00: According to new requirements I received from the manager.
SPEAKER_00: I would present them in the following.
SPEAKER_00: Ah, good.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, you can give us...
SPEAKER_04: So there are the frustrations expressed by users.
SPEAKER_04: So they say they lost often the remote control in the room.
SPEAKER_04: So they want to have a way to...
SPEAKER_00: To find it.
SPEAKER_00: To find it.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And a lot of the time, it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control.
SPEAKER_04: So they want something very simple and...
SPEAKER_04: Easy to use.
SPEAKER_04: And remote controls are bad for...
SPEAKER_04: What is RSI?
SPEAKER_03: RSI, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: You're a wrist.
SPEAKER_03: You can't be painful.
SPEAKER_03: You can't tell on this.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I didn't know that.
SPEAKER_03: If you also fit up on the computer in a tense position.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so we have to make it more ergonomic.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but...
SPEAKER_03: You can say...
SPEAKER_03: I can say...
SPEAKER_00: It's your job.
SPEAKER_00: Sorry.
SPEAKER_00: But the message from Microsoft.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, before that, I have some...
SPEAKER_04: Some...
SPEAKER_04: I think...
SPEAKER_04: To say, before.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: We know that...
SPEAKER_04: I use a lot of remote control to change channel.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And to change volume selection of...
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: And not a lot for setting...
SPEAKER_04: For setting the...
SPEAKER_04: The channels and things like that.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So it's better to put...
SPEAKER_04: Something very easy to that.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: This function should be very accessible.
SPEAKER_00: Very accessible, yes.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: This is the main function.
SPEAKER_04: So then we ask some questions to them.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And we ask this question.
SPEAKER_04: If they prefer an LCD screen or...
SPEAKER_04: On a remote function remote control.
SPEAKER_04: And if they pay more for a speech recognition in remote control.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And you can go...
SPEAKER_04: We have here the results of...
SPEAKER_03: The first question.
SPEAKER_04: Of the questions.
SPEAKER_04: So you know that...
SPEAKER_04: For the younger...
SPEAKER_04: It's very important.
SPEAKER_04: To have the speech recognition.
SPEAKER_04: And the others is...
SPEAKER_04: Not so important, but...
SPEAKER_04: We know that people between 15 and 25 are people who watch a lot TV.
SPEAKER_04: And who can use a lot of this...
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So maybe we can have a speech recognition.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, maybe this is important.
SPEAKER_00: Moreover, maybe those...
SPEAKER_00: Like those teenager customers can advise their parents to buy...
SPEAKER_00: This equipment.
SPEAKER_00: So we have to take care of that point of view, I think.
SPEAKER_00: Also.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Okay. And after it's a conclusion.
SPEAKER_04: So as we said before, I think...
SPEAKER_04: A remote control lighting in the dark, it's a good thing.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Not too many buttons like we said before.
SPEAKER_04: It's easy to use a way to find it easily in the room.
SPEAKER_04: And...
SPEAKER_04: Resistance...
SPEAKER_04: To...
SPEAKER_04: To shock and to...
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: And nice.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, these aren't...
SPEAKER_04: I don't know if you see something else important or...
SPEAKER_01: I'm just thinking of something.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: We want to have a...
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if this is a good idea.
SPEAKER_01: We want to have a general remote control for everything.
SPEAKER_00: No, no.
SPEAKER_00: It seems that we know what to have a TV remote control.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: From the management port, I receive an email.
SPEAKER_00: Because it would be costly.
SPEAKER_00: And also, it would take more time to develop to have a...
SPEAKER_00: A general remote control.
SPEAKER_03: It's not...
SPEAKER_03: I think...
SPEAKER_03: The second claim.
SPEAKER_00: That it would be too long to develop.
SPEAKER_03: That should be the same.
SPEAKER_00: Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Because I receive that email from management board.
SPEAKER_00: And it seems to tell that...
SPEAKER_00: That if we want to be on the market as early as possible, we should focus on TV more.
SPEAKER_00: It seems that the market is more important.
SPEAKER_00: So maybe it's a good decision.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know what's happening.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know if they should know what to do.
SPEAKER_03: I'm not going to be able to do a fast-to-can design.
SPEAKER_03: I don't think...
SPEAKER_01: Finish tonight.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: But basically, yeah, maybe I can continue with my presentation.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: But I think we have some technical problem also.
SPEAKER_01: So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Do I have...
SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I have enough cables.
SPEAKER_03: You can even like a dog with it.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so I'm just going to describe.
SPEAKER_01: In fact, for remote control, this is quite easy.
SPEAKER_01: We just have...
SPEAKER_01: Sorry.
SPEAKER_01: Kind of going...
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Are you okay?
SPEAKER_01: Like that.
SPEAKER_01: I'm just going to describe.
SPEAKER_01: Basically, we have a battery, a power supply here.
SPEAKER_01: After that, we just have a user in the face.
SPEAKER_01: Let's say that...
SPEAKER_01: Something like that, which could be an LCD, let's say, or an array of push button, something like that.
SPEAKER_01: Push button or LCD.
SPEAKER_01: After that, we feed that into an electronic chip.
SPEAKER_01: So I say, you see, and I feed that to an LED, which is infrared, which is an infrared component.
SPEAKER_01: And so, what we...
SPEAKER_01: For myself, this is for us, this is quite easy.
SPEAKER_00: You see the central unit?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: This is just a chip, which does all the numerical...
SPEAKER_01: Computational?
SPEAKER_01: numerical computation according to you display.
SPEAKER_01: And so for us, this is quite easy.
SPEAKER_01: We just need to define what we want to do when the user in the face wants something.
SPEAKER_01: And after that, we just do the coding to send that to the television.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So for us, this is quite easy.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. So this is quite easy.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And we just have to define the processing power that we need, especially if we want to do some speech recognition, in that case, that we are going to use more...
SPEAKER_01: This will take more time to develop.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, of course, of course.
SPEAKER_01: But for a standard one, this is really easy.
SPEAKER_01: It's a question of one month and so on.
SPEAKER_00: Do you speak about voice control?
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, I say.
SPEAKER_00: Stand at both and when?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Stand on remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Text may be one month to do that.
SPEAKER_03: So the only time problem is the voice control equation?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Definitely.
SPEAKER_00: So do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition?
SPEAKER_00: I would say...
SPEAKER_01: Tamir.
SPEAKER_01: I would say about 8 months to have the first results.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so it's a bit long, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: One month for the standard one with button.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Even if we have a LCD display.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, even.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, this is really standard devices now.
SPEAKER_01: And 8.
SPEAKER_01: For a speech recognition.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so we can take this into account.
SPEAKER_00: So we think it would be good to go for speech recognition.
SPEAKER_03: But we don't have time to market.
SPEAKER_01: And also, how much?
SPEAKER_01: I think...
SPEAKER_01: I think we should go on that.
SPEAKER_01: During the kickoff meeting, you said that we shouldn't go up to 12.5.
SPEAKER_01: Euro, some units.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So how many units should we sell together?
SPEAKER_00: Well, each unit is sell 25 euros.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but how many...
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: How much do you get?
SPEAKER_03: If you buy 1 million units, 1,000 units.
SPEAKER_03: Tips, because you need tips, right?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: How much would it cost for 1,000?
SPEAKER_01: Usually, this is less than that $2 per chip.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Because we have...
SPEAKER_03: Even for a powerful one that has good enough for those possible missions.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: It seems that we want to sell like 4 million units from the first meeting.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: For more than 4 million units.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe we can look at the new requirements I received from the management board and discuss all functions we want to have.
SPEAKER_01: I just had a question.
SPEAKER_01: Do you want to continue with your presentation?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I will continue.
SPEAKER_00: Well, ask your question if you want.
SPEAKER_01: You say that I don't remember my heart, but 30% of the people say that it's quite difficult to use the remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Do they say that this is difficult, but for the same reason, or do they have other reason?
SPEAKER_01: Maybe to keep in mind, maybe to access to that menu, you should do something.
SPEAKER_04: I think they say that it's difficult to learn how to use it.
SPEAKER_04: But when you know how to use it, it's okay.
SPEAKER_01: It's not intuitive.
SPEAKER_01: But yeah, maybe, and what about if we design a remote control, which can be configured as you want?
SPEAKER_01: You say that I want...
SPEAKER_01: I have six words on it.
SPEAKER_03: A lot of people are... if you have the LCD screen, you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also would look the way you want them.
SPEAKER_03: But it would be hard to configure.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, imagine that.
SPEAKER_03: So it's really something for the expert user.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, there are markets and markets.
SPEAKER_03: I think the young people that are...
SPEAKER_03: Christine here said that...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it is. So for our young people, it would be cool.
SPEAKER_03: They are able to use it.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe their parents will not, but they will configure it.
SPEAKER_03: I guess, I don't know if there's study.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe it would be more complex to configure it, to be simple.
SPEAKER_00: Then creating a simple project.
SPEAKER_03: And the other thing is that if you make something that's simple, and it's the user, the user means that it will be exactly the same as everything else.
SPEAKER_03: Otherwise, if it's different, then of course it will be hard to learn first.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But also, we see that most people find remote controls to complex because they have too many buttons.
SPEAKER_00: And they mainly use only channels and volume buttons.
SPEAKER_00: So we made just... make it very easy to use remote control, with mainly those buttons. And maybe also some lightning stuff because most people find also hard to find remote controls, lose it, etc.
SPEAKER_00: These two points are the main frustrations.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe if we design something very simple and easy to find when lost, it will add a serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop.
SPEAKER_00: But let us see first the new requirement.
SPEAKER_00: So we don't have to... so this is in the same direction as we were speaking.
SPEAKER_00: So we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext.
SPEAKER_00: And stuff like that.
SPEAKER_03: That takes just one button.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but then you have to define the buttons to serve amongst pages.
SPEAKER_03: So we'll do that with the channel key.
SPEAKER_00: So anyway, we don't have to include this feature because it's not used anymore by users.
SPEAKER_03: I'm sure that it doesn't like, but I don't see just one button.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: If one button is still one more button, if we want to make it very simple, we have to reduce the number of buttons compared to our competitors.
SPEAKER_00: Well, anyway, I have this point we can discuss.
SPEAKER_00: Also, as I told before, it would be better if it's only for the TV because we want to be quick on the market.
SPEAKER_00: And then also we have to make very clear that this remote control is part of our products and show our corporate logo and colors on the design as well, so that they identify it as one of our products.
SPEAKER_00: So this is the key point.
SPEAKER_00: So before finishing, we can define what would be the characteristic of the control, of the remote control and which button do we need, which function do we want, etc.
SPEAKER_00: Capital.
SPEAKER_00: So, do you...
SPEAKER_00: So from the marketing expert, I think a key aspect is the easy to use aspect.
SPEAKER_00: It should be very simple and most buttons are never used only 10% of the buttons are used often.
SPEAKER_00: So I think we have to do something very simple and I think we all agree on that point.
SPEAKER_03: Well, if it is going to be just the TV remote control, it is going to be very simple.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_00: So, the key point here is simple.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe, so, a few buttons, channel volume control, and what function do you see?
SPEAKER_03: The key point is simple, just the TV remote control, there is no other function.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe switch TV on and off.
SPEAKER_03: You want to keep all the zones so that advertising can, even you can come back.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, volume, maybe a mute button and then one off button.
SPEAKER_00: And that's all.
SPEAKER_01: I know that you say that many people are doing plenty of zapping.
SPEAKER_01: I know I discovered that when I did a quick look.
SPEAKER_01: They do not, so they do something which is quite nice now.
SPEAKER_01: You have a button, you press it and this is the previous channel which is coming back.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, this is cool.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe we can include that also, previews channel button.
SPEAKER_00: So, we have like channel button, the previous channel button, the volume button, press a mute button and just the traditional one off button.
SPEAKER_03: And of course, the channel changing buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I talk about that.
SPEAKER_03: How should we implement that?
SPEAKER_03: Because there could be numerical only, there could be also incremental.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Incremental, definitely because zapping you switch them.
SPEAKER_01: Let's say that we can do something like that.
SPEAKER_01: This is a ninx remanthal.
SPEAKER_01: But when you press it for a long time, you go 5 by 5.
SPEAKER_01: You go faster?
SPEAKER_01: You go faster.
SPEAKER_03: Hmm, the standard thing idea that if you press it for a long time, it does something else in general.
SPEAKER_03: So, if you have your 10 buttons for the numerical buttons and you have, instead of having just one memory, you have a few percent for a long time.
SPEAKER_03: No, it doesn't work.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe we should have also a DG, but have a complete keyboard and type console commands.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, thanks to the channel 2A.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe we have also two FDG, or only incremental.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know, because if you have this for like, if you want to 10 to 203 channels, for example, then you cannot work with just memory and incremental.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, because you have your previous channel button, if you have incremental only, it doesn't work.
SPEAKER_00: Because the previous channel is either minus one or plus one.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So, I think we need also DG.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe we can make very obvious the channel and volume button, and smaller button, turned there with the DG.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, when you tap usually, you would like to press the same button at the time.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, we can do something like that.
SPEAKER_01: We can design the remote control to have access.
SPEAKER_01: Some remote control have protection.
SPEAKER_01: And so, you...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I just was thinking, there is a...
SPEAKER_03: You know, that's some mass with a wheel like this.
SPEAKER_03: Just having the up-down buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, kind of justic.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, maybe we can have a wheel for incremental.
SPEAKER_00: So, have a wheel for incremental, have the DG on the lower side that can be closed.
SPEAKER_00: So, as you say, protected.
SPEAKER_00: And, yeah, I think this is the first side.
SPEAKER_03: You have to turn it.
SPEAKER_01: And do we have a...
SPEAKER_01: Or a ball?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, not a wheel, but a ball.
SPEAKER_01: And you say, it's better.
SPEAKER_00: I would say the wheel is better.
SPEAKER_03: It is the expert of...
SPEAKER_03: Because it's not like a volume with a smooth, you turn it into one by one.
SPEAKER_03: So, you have to...
SPEAKER_03: The user should feel the...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, the script.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, a bit.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's a good idea.
None: And...
SPEAKER_00: Well, also, we have to decide...
SPEAKER_00: So, it should be lightening in the dark.
SPEAKER_00: I think, because most people lost their remote control.
SPEAKER_01: It's quite easy with backlight on the...
SPEAKER_01: With LED or...
SPEAKER_03: If it's a blue LED and we set that...
SPEAKER_00: And we put an LCD display, because it was important for young customers, if you remember.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's all important if you have multifunction.
SPEAKER_03: If it's not multifunction, then there's no proponing, actually.
SPEAKER_03: Just increase the cost.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, the user doesn't have an advantage of that.
SPEAKER_00: So, no LCD.
SPEAKER_00: And so, no speech as well, because it would delay too much...
SPEAKER_00: The development tools.
SPEAKER_03: The delay, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It would be cool.
SPEAKER_03: It would go to your country.
SPEAKER_03: Say, CNN, for example.
SPEAKER_03: It would go to CNN.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that would be cool.
SPEAKER_00: But, eight months is really long.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe we can just...
SPEAKER_00: Ten years.
SPEAKER_00: So...
SPEAKER_00: I will...
