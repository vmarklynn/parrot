SPEAKER_03: It's notYourDays Lie diseases?
SPEAKER_02: Hello.
SPEAKER_02: Good afternoon sorry I am a late.
SPEAKER_02: No broadly.
SPEAKER_02: Good second traffic.
SPEAKER_01: It's possible this time of day starts at 3 o'clock.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Let me see.
SPEAKER_01: Our fourth and last meeting.
SPEAKER_01: There he is.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, this is our last meeting.
SPEAKER_01: This meeting we will discuss our final design.
SPEAKER_01: And we will do some evaluation about not only the product, but also the project.
SPEAKER_01: And then we're going to close the project today as well.
SPEAKER_01: So after that you'll be free to go and spend all your money.
SPEAKER_01: And this design, detailed design meeting, we will discuss the look and feel of the design, the usability interface design, and we will do the product evaluation.
SPEAKER_01: In order to do that, we have this agenda.
SPEAKER_01: We will have the prototype presentation first.
SPEAKER_01: Then we will set up some evaluation criteria.
SPEAKER_01: Then we will look at the finance.
SPEAKER_01: We will have to see if everything we want to do is also possible within our budget.
SPEAKER_01: Because everything goes money.
SPEAKER_01: And the more functions you want to have, the more money it will cost.
SPEAKER_01: So we have to see if it fits within the 12.5 euro per remote.
SPEAKER_01: We will see that later.
SPEAKER_01: Then we will do the project evaluation and the closing after that.
SPEAKER_01: We've got 40 minutes.
SPEAKER_01: So we will be finished at half past three.
SPEAKER_01: But first, we will do the prototype presentation.
SPEAKER_01: So if there's somebody else for it.
SPEAKER_00: Well, this is what me and Richard came up with.
SPEAKER_00: The default spot for the on-off button.
SPEAKER_00: The mute button just below that.
SPEAKER_00: Then there's the volume and channel selectors.
SPEAKER_00: Simple plus minus button.
SPEAKER_00: We thought of a help button.
SPEAKER_00: If you hold it and you press another button, the help goes to the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_00: Then there's the 0 to 1 to 0 buttons.
SPEAKER_00: A button for a teletext.
SPEAKER_00: A button for the subtitles and the company logo.
SPEAKER_00: So it's rather simple prototype.
SPEAKER_00: And we'll have to see from testing how the user's take it.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Is this the moment where we ask?
SPEAKER_02: Where can I ask questions about the functionality?
SPEAKER_00: Sure.
SPEAKER_00: Just pop in at any time.
SPEAKER_02: When you're in teletext, there are usually buttons where you just press it and you go to the next teletext page.
SPEAKER_04: That's just the normal remote controls.
SPEAKER_04: So you push it.
SPEAKER_04: You come in page 100.
SPEAKER_04: You can use the normal 1 to 0 buttons.
SPEAKER_04: You can also use the better for changing the channel.
SPEAKER_04: So the shifting better.
SPEAKER_04: For shifting up in the teletext and shifting down.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: But I thought in a few meetings earlier we tried to give it simple.
SPEAKER_01: Just a few buttons and large buttons.
SPEAKER_01: But I think these are all together.
SPEAKER_01: Quite a few buttons.
SPEAKER_01: So I'm wondering if we really need all of those buttons.
SPEAKER_00: I think if you look at most controls, they've got more buttons than this.
SPEAKER_00: And well, the on-off button is a necessity.
SPEAKER_00: You can't drop that one.
SPEAKER_00: The volume and channel buttons, you obviously need those.
SPEAKER_00: The mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume down button twice.
SPEAKER_00: So we could cancel that one.
SPEAKER_00: I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does.
SPEAKER_04: Or you can build in when you press one button.
SPEAKER_04: Long time.
SPEAKER_04: We just discussed that already.
SPEAKER_04: We think all people don't know that option.
SPEAKER_00: Well, you can't leave out the number buttons, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: And take some subtitles.
SPEAKER_00: So it's rather basic already.
SPEAKER_02: That's what I pointed out earlier, you just make control for just the TV. There's just not much to gain here.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So yeah, somebody about something about the design of the buttons there?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's not a hard to draw on the whiteboard, but they're supposed to be equal sized round with a little logo on it for the volume, the triangle and stuff.
SPEAKER_04: Just for recognition.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, and we don't need a letter or some remote controls.
SPEAKER_04: Because we use the little display, we don't have to use it.
SPEAKER_00: So for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons.
SPEAKER_00: We have a different color than the case, so they jump out.
SPEAKER_01: Because we only have 30 minutes left, I will move on to the finance part, which is pretty exciting to see if it's all possible what we want to do.
SPEAKER_01: And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for 12.5 euros.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if I'm building correctly, so just correct me if you see something wrong.
SPEAKER_01: I counted two batteries, but maybe we can also use one.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if it's possible.
SPEAKER_01: It's rechargeable.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, let's do euros.
SPEAKER_01: We need the advanced chip, so there's not much to save there.
SPEAKER_01: Here we have the single curve.
SPEAKER_01: We can see that the difference between end curves and the single curve is 1 euro.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know, but I think the single curve is good for the design and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control.
SPEAKER_01: I think we have to keep that.
SPEAKER_01: Then we have the case material supplements.
SPEAKER_01: It's plastic. It's the cheapest one we need.
SPEAKER_01: So that's not much to save either.
SPEAKER_01: But then the biggest cost are the buttons. So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our cost though.
SPEAKER_01: Because we will have to get 12.5 euros at the end.
SPEAKER_01: So let's first count the buttons we have now.
SPEAKER_01: That will be even more than 18 euros.
SPEAKER_01: 17.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, including the help.
SPEAKER_01: I think we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long or pressing down a number.
SPEAKER_01: That saves us 1 euro already.
SPEAKER_01: Then we have got 15, I think.
SPEAKER_02: I assume you count the volume and channel for two buttons each.
SPEAKER_01: Those are one.
SPEAKER_04: I think actually there are two buttons.
SPEAKER_04: It's just one better.
SPEAKER_04: Two for one big bell.
SPEAKER_04: But they are more expensive than the small ones.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but it's not stated in this.
SPEAKER_01: So maybe we can make one button with the volume in the channel in one by pressing.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I think maybe you can just integrate three of those numbers to one button.
SPEAKER_02: That's the possibility as well.
SPEAKER_01: So it's good for the design as well.
SPEAKER_01: It looks a bit like a cross.
SPEAKER_04: I think they count the materials.
SPEAKER_04: It's not a better one itself, but on the chip there.
SPEAKER_01: But I think because we have the advanced chip, we can just count this as one button.
SPEAKER_02: But now that I think this really is for buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe it is, but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get 12 and a half euros.
SPEAKER_01: Also the LC display.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's too expensive for the display we use.
SPEAKER_00: If we leave out the display, we can also save money on the chip.
SPEAKER_01: That's right.
SPEAKER_01: But what's the biggest foundation of our remote then?
SPEAKER_02: Only the docking station, I guess.
SPEAKER_00: But the docking station isn't even in this schematic.
SPEAKER_01: No, it's not even taken into the price.
SPEAKER_01: That's extra.
SPEAKER_01: That's right.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe we should move to a different supplier.
SPEAKER_01: That's an option.
SPEAKER_01: Poland, something.
SPEAKER_01: Polish player.
SPEAKER_01: If we can count this as one button and integrate these buttons in three, then we save a lot of money as well.
SPEAKER_00: We could save money on it, but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.
SPEAKER_00: My mother can't even send a nasa-mess message.
SPEAKER_04: That's a point.
SPEAKER_04: We can't buy a remote control when you can use it.
SPEAKER_04: We must stay below 1250.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Well, since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier, more easy, maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little.
SPEAKER_02: Especially since we have those nice features.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but we have to stick to the 1250.
SPEAKER_01: We don't have any more budget to the market.
SPEAKER_01: It's a little bit too small.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: It's possible to make one for 1250.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01: If you leave out the LCD display and if you use less buttons, say...
SPEAKER_01: You can do it with a single chip.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: You want to make a bit than fancy and good looking.
SPEAKER_04: With an effective option.
SPEAKER_04: You can stay below 1250.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's difficult as well.
SPEAKER_02: We can actually be a choice between either a good remote and a higher production cost or just any other remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Or we can leave out the 10 buttons and take one scroll wheel for the program numbers.
SPEAKER_01: Then we save 10 buttons and we have 5 and 1.
SPEAKER_01: Let's see if we have this one and we've got the advanced.
SPEAKER_00: We're getting closer.
SPEAKER_00: We can't get closer.
SPEAKER_02: How would a scroll wheel work here?
SPEAKER_01: Maybe you can scroll.
SPEAKER_01: If you scroll, you will see the numbers on the LCD display until you've got the right number and you push it.
SPEAKER_02: That would bring up the price of the scroll wheel also.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, but then you can push some other buttons as well.
SPEAKER_00: You could just not scroll for half a second.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: That's right.
SPEAKER_01: If you scroll to a number and you wait a half second, then it turns to that channel.
SPEAKER_02: I think that would be the end of our usability.
SPEAKER_01: It would definitely drop costs.
SPEAKER_01: We need the battery.
SPEAKER_01: The regular chip is not possible.
SPEAKER_00: It has to be advanced.
SPEAKER_00: If you want to use an LCD screen, you need an advanced chip.
SPEAKER_01: Then we can save a Euro by a flat design.
SPEAKER_01: That's an option we can...
SPEAKER_01: Then we're almost there.
SPEAKER_00: If you could just leave out one more button.
SPEAKER_04: Or we have to skip the subtitle button.
SPEAKER_01: That is a big advantage for us.
SPEAKER_01: Can we integrate the text and the subtitles in one button?
SPEAKER_01: If you push it...
SPEAKER_02: Three titles.
SPEAKER_02: Right now you just push the text button.
SPEAKER_02: Go to page 888.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And the text disappears, but the subtitles stay there.
SPEAKER_04: But if you push it, it's a bit too wide.
SPEAKER_00: What if you have to scroll to page 888?
SPEAKER_02: That could be just scroll to 8.
SPEAKER_02: But then again, that would be just a pretty much an option for all their people.
SPEAKER_02: Don't even know what a scroll wheel is.
SPEAKER_02: Holding a remote with today's spec to have like ten buttons for the numbers 1 to 0.
SPEAKER_02: There are only five buttons on it.
SPEAKER_02: And a scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: I think if you make good advertisement on television and in the guide, you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: You just make it real simple.
SPEAKER_01: It saves a lot of money and we can keep our LCD screen, which can provide extra information how to use the scroll wheel, how to use the other buttons as subtitles.
SPEAKER_01: And it's good for the innovative design as well.
SPEAKER_01: If you would erase these...
SPEAKER_01: You're razor.
None: Hey, we could put...
SPEAKER_01: Looks a bit odd, maybe.
SPEAKER_02: That's a pretty big scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_03: Something like that.
SPEAKER_01: Then we've got the scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: If we erase this one...
SPEAKER_01: These are two buttons then.
SPEAKER_00: We could wake two buttons out of that.
SPEAKER_00: If you press the volume button, you can control the volume with the scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_00: So that would save two buttons if you do the same for the channel.
SPEAKER_01: That's really a good idea.
SPEAKER_01: And that will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious.
SPEAKER_01: So we make one for the volume, one for the channel.
SPEAKER_01: Please scroll.
SPEAKER_01: So if we...
SPEAKER_01: That's right.
SPEAKER_01: So we've got one, two, three.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we can leave the text in if we want.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: That's me so it's better.
SPEAKER_00: If we leave out all those buttons perhaps you can go with the flat case and make it smaller overall.
SPEAKER_00: So if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button, the screen right under that then the scroll button.
SPEAKER_00: You get a much smaller remote.
SPEAKER_01: So we can decrease this one to four buttons.
SPEAKER_02: Right now we have five buttons.
SPEAKER_04: You can make quite a big remote control for just the same price as a small one.
SPEAKER_04: You have to pay for the double curved or single curved.
SPEAKER_01: So it's more the moles in which they are being made I think.
SPEAKER_01: Single curved is really easy to just fill in and cases come right out of the machine.
SPEAKER_01: Single curved you have to have a different machine than a flat one.
SPEAKER_01: I think this is a really easy one.
SPEAKER_01: But does everybody think about the flat or single curved design?
SPEAKER_02: Well I still think we should go for the single curved design.
SPEAKER_00: Richard argument was very good.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We have to cut costs.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to just go to the board and ask for more money.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But I think we can then keep the single curved one just to express our LCD screen a bit more.
SPEAKER_01: So people will use it more and especially for the help functions.
SPEAKER_01: It will be good if we have scroll bar scroll button.
SPEAKER_01: It will be necessary to have a good help function as well.
SPEAKER_01: Sorry this is scroll.
SPEAKER_01: I think it was better to have this price this bit earlier before we went on to the whole design.
SPEAKER_01: But I'm glad we could make a bit.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's pretty different.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So all the last one.
SPEAKER_02: And this one.
SPEAKER_02: This is not really like for the group we were making or remote.
SPEAKER_02: This will really require a lot of marketing.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And to get this to sell.
SPEAKER_02: Because if other people like familiar forms and familiar stuff, this is not familiar for them.
SPEAKER_02: No, but I think we have to do a lot of convincing them.
SPEAKER_04: I think the most.
SPEAKER_04: But they know the scroll buttons from old radio.
SPEAKER_04: They also buttons like that for changing.
SPEAKER_01: We can let it.
SPEAKER_01: We can stick it out.
SPEAKER_01: Like old buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe that's recognizable for them as well.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's a good one.
SPEAKER_01: So I'm afraid we have to move on.
SPEAKER_01: And it's less frightening I think if they see this design they think there are only five buttons.
SPEAKER_01: But we will see.
SPEAKER_02: But it might be confusing too.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But it's very special.
SPEAKER_04: So I would buy.
None: Yeah, but you're not 60.
SPEAKER_01: That's right.
SPEAKER_01: I would buy if I was 60.
SPEAKER_01: No, I didn't know.
SPEAKER_01: Articus and 12 and all of you rose?
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, they are.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: No, but we can go on with the project evaluation.
SPEAKER_01: Let's see.
SPEAKER_01: I can sit down I think we still have 15 minutes left so nice on schedule.
SPEAKER_01: The project process.
SPEAKER_02: So I like set up all these criteria.
SPEAKER_02: A valuation criteria.
SPEAKER_02: That's right.
SPEAKER_01: That was the thingy.
SPEAKER_01: The point I forgot.
SPEAKER_01: Shoot.
SPEAKER_01: There we are.
SPEAKER_01: If the evaluation could do you.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: Go ahead.
SPEAKER_01: We've got five minutes I think.
SPEAKER_01: Five more minutes.
SPEAKER_01: No, we've got 15 minutes.
SPEAKER_01: But okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so I did some literature study.
SPEAKER_02: Analysis of the requirements we set up earlier.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Translated it into criteria.
SPEAKER_02: Which would be these.
SPEAKER_02: Is the remote fancy?
SPEAKER_02: The shape looking few?
SPEAKER_02: Inovative.
SPEAKER_02: What new functions are there?
SPEAKER_02: Easy to use.
SPEAKER_02: Learnability is a very important factor here.
SPEAKER_02: Is it functional?
SPEAKER_02: Are there not too many functions?
SPEAKER_02: A amount of functions and are those functions that are there?
SPEAKER_02: Are they useful?
SPEAKER_02: And the cost.
SPEAKER_02: The target group is the remote really for the group we're making it for.
SPEAKER_02: And great cognitive ability.
SPEAKER_02: If our company is if it is easily recognizable, there are company made it.
SPEAKER_02: So we're supposed to be evaluated right now.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Let's see.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I have to say this was a little hard because the minutes over the last meeting.
SPEAKER_02: We're not here.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's because my pen failed to upload his data.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I tried to, but it's giving errors.
SPEAKER_01: It's giving errors by downloading software.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Is the design fancy on a scale of 1 to 7?
SPEAKER_01: I think it's fancy.
SPEAKER_04: Six.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: You'll go for six.
SPEAKER_02: Good.
SPEAKER_02: Is the design inovative?
SPEAKER_02: Very.
SPEAKER_01: I'll see these same titles.
SPEAKER_01: Seven.
SPEAKER_01: Seven?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So we've got 20 cents for our docking station.
SPEAKER_02: Should we do all?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Is the design easy to use?
SPEAKER_01: That's a bit...
None:土y.
SPEAKER_02: Well, would be for us, but...
SPEAKER_01: I would say four.
SPEAKER_01: Four or five.
SPEAKER_01: Four or five.
SPEAKER_01: I'd go for four or two.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Is it functional?
SPEAKER_02: Is the design functional?
SPEAKER_02: Do we have all functions that we want to include?
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: I think we do.
SPEAKER_02: Do we have too many functions?
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: No, I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01: It's pretty slow.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's seven.
SPEAKER_02: Seven?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, and do we...
SPEAKER_02: Take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control, like it getting lost, and...
SPEAKER_00: Sorry, I haven't thought of that one.
SPEAKER_01: Of course.
SPEAKER_01: I think we do.
SPEAKER_01: I had them worked out.
SPEAKER_01: They're ugly, not very functional, and getting lost.
SPEAKER_02: But the production costs within the preset limits?
SPEAKER_02: Well, they are now.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Does the design fit the group of focus?
SPEAKER_00: I think that's a free.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: No, I think with a new radio button, I think it's better.
SPEAKER_04: We have the test.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, no.
SPEAKER_00: I still...
SPEAKER_00: I think it's too fancy to flash...
SPEAKER_02: Radio button is not exactly what older people expect of remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, true.
SPEAKER_01: How we give it a four?
SPEAKER_02: I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_02: I think I'd go for two.
SPEAKER_02: I'd go for three.
SPEAKER_03: That way I'll have to do it three.
SPEAKER_03: It's good.
SPEAKER_02: Is the company recognizable?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, it is.
SPEAKER_02: It's the logo there.
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_01: And they want to put fashion in their products in the slogan of the company.
SPEAKER_01: We have the removable front cases.
SPEAKER_01: So I think it's very recognizable.
SPEAKER_02: There will be this.
SPEAKER_02: I was also supposed to calculate the score, but...
SPEAKER_02: Thought we would have another private...
SPEAKER_02: We've got a calculator after this.
SPEAKER_00: 20.
SPEAKER_01: Like after this are we done?
SPEAKER_01: We've got the...
SPEAKER_02: We've evaluated.
SPEAKER_02: Well, anyhow, these are seven factors.
SPEAKER_02: Time seven is 40.
SPEAKER_02: Something, two.
SPEAKER_02: Nine.
SPEAKER_01: Nine.
SPEAKER_01: Nine.
SPEAKER_02: Nine is 49.
SPEAKER_02: Minus one.
SPEAKER_02: Minus three.
SPEAKER_02: Minus four.
SPEAKER_02: Minus four.
SPEAKER_02: Minus eight.
SPEAKER_02: 41.
SPEAKER_02: 41.
None: Out of 49.
SPEAKER_01: That's...
SPEAKER_03: All right, 80%.
SPEAKER_02: I guess we'll just touch the name on the bottom here.
SPEAKER_01: Does 84%.
SPEAKER_01: I think that's a pretty nice score.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So that will be the evaluation.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: So that brings us to the project evaluation.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: Project process.
SPEAKER_01: Did we move through the right faces, you think, along the process?
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think we should have had the finance thing a lot earlier.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That's right.
SPEAKER_02: In the design phase.
SPEAKER_01: So lack of information about prices.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's true.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So this section was there room for creativity?
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_01: Not too much now.
SPEAKER_02: It's because of the finance.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: There was no room but the finance.
SPEAKER_00: The room was...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And I would have liked to go for the...
SPEAKER_02: younger users also.
SPEAKER_02: And just to be able to access internet and...
SPEAKER_02: get something of your own.
SPEAKER_02: Strictions.
SPEAKER_01: Internet access.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Leadership.
SPEAKER_01: Was it clear what everybody had to do?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: According to their roles and functions.
SPEAKER_04: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: Teamwork.
SPEAKER_01: Did it work out?
SPEAKER_01: Working together.
SPEAKER_01: Also, you two with...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it was okay.
SPEAKER_01: Last phase.
SPEAKER_01: Nice.
SPEAKER_00: The tasks are very strictured so you can just do step by step.
SPEAKER_00: It was very easy.
SPEAKER_01: Searched tasks.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Were there means sufficient for the tasks that we had to do?
SPEAKER_01: Or were there too much?
SPEAKER_00: Well, the smart board...
SPEAKER_00: The drawing is just a pain in the ass but...
SPEAKER_00: Smartboard...
SPEAKER_00: The digital pen is very nice.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: If it wants to download this data.
None: Smartboard was...
SPEAKER_03: You're dating.
SPEAKER_01: So you brought in one of the flip over or...
SPEAKER_00: Flip over or a more precise...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Fosters as well.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Flip over.
SPEAKER_04: But if you want to share...
SPEAKER_04: When you make a picture like this on the presentation.
SPEAKER_04: It's easier to share it with other people.
SPEAKER_04: So you can save it and put it on the internet or...
SPEAKER_04: In the shared folder or...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I tried to open the file.
SPEAKER_02: It's on my laptop but it didn't work.
SPEAKER_01: You need the smartboard application I think.
SPEAKER_01: But I think you can...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Should be possible.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you can export this image.
SPEAKER_01: Best.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, best be.
None: You should have done that.
SPEAKER_01: So the sharing of the information was okay.
SPEAKER_01: That's it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'm here on the table.
None: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: Or questions about the project or...
SPEAKER_01: About the product?
SPEAKER_01: It goes...
SPEAKER_01: I think...
SPEAKER_01: Then that we...
SPEAKER_01: Get to our last week.
SPEAKER_01: Articles within the budget?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Considering we are not going to make a docking station.
SPEAKER_01: That's good.
SPEAKER_01: But maybe because of the docking station, the...
SPEAKER_01: Price of the remote can also be a little bit higher.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And I think you can compensate that as well.
SPEAKER_01: So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem because it's very cheap to make as well.
SPEAKER_01: Do we think we're going to get the 12.5 million?
SPEAKER_01: What was it?
SPEAKER_01: 15 million.
SPEAKER_01: 15 million.
SPEAKER_01: I think we will.
SPEAKER_01: If you're going to export this product, it's innovative.

SPEAKER_01: Take a dent.
SPEAKER_01: Sometimes.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, still don't think...
SPEAKER_02: I mean, if we're going to make a scroll button anyway.
SPEAKER_02: You can do more.
SPEAKER_02: You can do more for the younger people and for the older people.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So maybe we should just refocus.
SPEAKER_01: Just put it on the market for everybody.
SPEAKER_01: You can...
SPEAKER_01: Specifically for...
SPEAKER_01: You can change markets by changing the front cover.
SPEAKER_01: That's one thing you can change it with.
SPEAKER_01: So you can also try to reach the younger people by putting fancy covers on the market.
SPEAKER_01: Just as a test.
SPEAKER_01: See how it works?
SPEAKER_01: That's I think a good advantage.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is.
SPEAKER_02: Then it would be with older people.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Even if it were there covers.
SPEAKER_01: Then I think we can have our little celebration right now.
SPEAKER_01: That's it.
SPEAKER_01: I think we still have to fill in one more questioner.
SPEAKER_01: I think...
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: I didn't get a message from the...
SPEAKER_01: Oh, I think I have one.
SPEAKER_01: Five more minutes.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, let's guys.
SPEAKER_01: Then we still have some questions.
SPEAKER_01: If somebody has some questions they can ask them now.
SPEAKER_01: We can put these in the project folder as well.
SPEAKER_01: Let's get it.
SPEAKER_01: Export is...
SPEAKER_01: Picture I think?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I'll just put it in my documents and...
SPEAKER_01: That's okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I think I'm going to make our final presentation now.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you're supposed to make it.
SPEAKER_01: And then I will be back in about 10 minutes to show you the final presentation.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Summary of the project.
SPEAKER_02: Are we supposed to go into our rooms again?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, maybe if the full...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: No questioner.
SPEAKER_01: I think you all get the questioner in your room.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And then I'll meet you and think about 10 minutes.
