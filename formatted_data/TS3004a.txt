None: Hello.
SPEAKER_00: Good morning.
SPEAKER_03: Hello.
SPEAKER_00: You have to put it exactly on the plate.
SPEAKER_02: Good morning.
SPEAKER_01: Good morning.
SPEAKER_00: Should I bring my pen to?
SPEAKER_00: No, that's for me.
SPEAKER_03: I've got my mouse.
SPEAKER_01: I do.
SPEAKER_02: Come on.
SPEAKER_02: There we are.
SPEAKER_03: My laptop is crashing.
None: Damn, computer.
SPEAKER_02: Help, help, help.
SPEAKER_02: Let's just check one more time.
SPEAKER_03: Can't hear me.
SPEAKER_03: Actually, my laptop doesn't work.
SPEAKER_03: Check.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I think it works.
SPEAKER_01: Test, test.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, it's work.
SPEAKER_00: So you're all right, what are we going to do or not?
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to make a remote control.
SPEAKER_01: I think my laptop is with etchy.
SPEAKER_00: I just made a simple presentation.
SPEAKER_00: We also put some things in it.
SPEAKER_00: How does this work?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: One, I'll hold it right.
SPEAKER_03: That's one.
SPEAKER_00: That's half 11.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So that's my name.
SPEAKER_00: We're going to make a remote control.
SPEAKER_00: You already know that.
SPEAKER_00: We have a look.
SPEAKER_00: We're going to this agenda of our meeting.
SPEAKER_00: You know this is about 25 minutes.
SPEAKER_00: This meeting.
SPEAKER_00: The first thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do.
SPEAKER_00: We also read what these things are.
SPEAKER_00: Not yet.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So it has to be original training user friendly.
SPEAKER_00: That's where we're going to design.
SPEAKER_00: First, we have three steps of making the remote control.
SPEAKER_00: The first thing is the functional design.
SPEAKER_00: It's very important.
SPEAKER_00: We have to look what the needs are, the effects of the functional design.
SPEAKER_00: And how the remote control works.
SPEAKER_00: That's where we're going to look in the functional design.
SPEAKER_00: That's for the next meeting.
SPEAKER_00: The second thing is the conceptual design.
SPEAKER_00: That's what the specifications of the components and properties.
SPEAKER_00: And the specifications of the user interface.
SPEAKER_00: We have to look what the market is doing for what kind of remote controls are in the market.
SPEAKER_00: And the third thing is the detailed design.
SPEAKER_00: And that's exactly what it is.
SPEAKER_00: This is exactly how it looks.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So this is two smart boards.
SPEAKER_00: There's an introduction of that one.
SPEAKER_00: You already saw.
SPEAKER_00: You know all that you can put things in the project map folder.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So now we have a look at that one.
SPEAKER_00: So what we're going to do first is so you can read.
SPEAKER_00: You have to draw a favorite animal on the white board.
SPEAKER_00: And say, why is your favorite animal?
SPEAKER_00: So, and you have to try it out.
SPEAKER_00: And we have to use different pen colors and different thickness of the pen.
SPEAKER_00: So first, to show you, maybe you can come here to have a look how it works.
SPEAKER_00: You can see that.
SPEAKER_00: This is a new page.
SPEAKER_00: It's okay.
SPEAKER_00: You spend format.
SPEAKER_00: And a different color can use you.
SPEAKER_00: And I just take pink.
SPEAKER_00: Take, there's no pink.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Purple.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: And line with ten.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: I'll just take what I'm going to draw as an elephant.
SPEAKER_00: I'll draw slowly because otherwise it won't work.
SPEAKER_00: It's a very nice elephant.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: It looks very nice.
SPEAKER_00: And just how much is this?
SPEAKER_00: Oh, no.
SPEAKER_00: It's like a dinosaur.
SPEAKER_02: It's a pink elephant.
SPEAKER_00: This takes you long.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Whatever.
SPEAKER_00: Just erase this one.
SPEAKER_00: It's a bit slow.
SPEAKER_00: You can see this is a bit annoying.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So just for you guys, just one of you can draw a painting if you want.
SPEAKER_00: Just round.
SPEAKER_00: Don't, yeah, just use it like that.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Just say format.
SPEAKER_03: You can use a pen.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And what's the color?
SPEAKER_00: It's a format.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I'll take this one.
SPEAKER_03: Just to be water.
SPEAKER_03: No, it has to be an animal.
SPEAKER_00: So if it should be a snake, it's an animal.
SPEAKER_03: So I first draw the water.
SPEAKER_02: The water is important.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Now I'll make the animal.
SPEAKER_03: It's a fish.
SPEAKER_03: Wow.
SPEAKER_02: So.
SPEAKER_03: And this is so verm.
None: Beautiful.
None: Yeah.
None: Wow.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Next.
SPEAKER_03: Do you have to write down what you want?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Wow.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Next.
SPEAKER_00: Do you have to write down why it doesn't matter.
SPEAKER_00: It's to get used to the white part.
None: Okay.
None: Just make a new blank page.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Well, Paul.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Like this.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, not too far to the pen.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Let's make it.
SPEAKER_02: And dark.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back so that.
SPEAKER_01: No, today.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's a pig.
SPEAKER_03: Pig?
SPEAKER_02: No, it's a dog.
SPEAKER_02: No, it's a dog.
SPEAKER_02: It's a sheep.
SPEAKER_02: Not a hat.
SPEAKER_00: We only have 25 minutes.
SPEAKER_00: Take it easy.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, I'll make a cat of it.
SPEAKER_01: I was going to make a cat too.
SPEAKER_00: You should find this.
SPEAKER_02: Not too quick.
SPEAKER_00: Just hold it more to the back thing.
SPEAKER_02: I just draw it too quick.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: That's it.
SPEAKER_02: More?
SPEAKER_00: No, that's okay.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: I thought these pens would be just.
SPEAKER_00: You write it down and you don't know the two words.
SPEAKER_00: You already did it or no?
SPEAKER_00: No.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's right.
SPEAKER_02: You just...
SPEAKER_02: You just got to write on this paper.
SPEAKER_02: Sorry.
SPEAKER_02: You really got to write on this paper?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I know.
SPEAKER_00: It's a real pen.
SPEAKER_00: I thought it would be just in the type of words.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's just a picture.
SPEAKER_00: Oh.
SPEAKER_00: So, it's not that cool what I thought it would be.
SPEAKER_03: You can't edit it in the words.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: Oh.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: It's a donkey.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know what time did we start this meeting and not sure.
SPEAKER_02: I think it was...
SPEAKER_03: Half past ten.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
None: Brilliant.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Nice.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
None: Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: You have to save everything.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So, what we know is that we have to sell this remote control for about 25 euros.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: And we have to make a profit of 50 million euros.
SPEAKER_00: So, we have to use a big market in Europe.
SPEAKER_00: Please.
SPEAKER_00: The prediction costs about half the price is selling price.
SPEAKER_00: Sorry.
SPEAKER_00: Wow.
SPEAKER_00: Easy.
SPEAKER_00: So, can someone make a calculation about how many we have to sell these to make 50 million?
SPEAKER_00: No.
SPEAKER_00: So, we're going to have a little discussion about what the experience are with the remote controller.
SPEAKER_00: So, we're going to have a little discussion about what the experience is and everything.
SPEAKER_00: So, we just have a look.
SPEAKER_03: We think about remote controls.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: My first question was, does it have to be a universal remote control?
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That's a good question.
SPEAKER_03: Because we sell it only from the...
SPEAKER_03: And not with the television.
SPEAKER_03: We sell it apart.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's...
SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_01: It's not...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it probably would be universal.
SPEAKER_02: And not only television or more devices.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think you can buy a universal remote control for 25 years.
SPEAKER_00: Not sure.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I know.
SPEAKER_03: You can buy a universal control.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So, we just say it's a universal remote control.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Perfect.
SPEAKER_01: And also for the FECR and DVD player.
SPEAKER_01: And everything.
SPEAKER_00: Just...
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Buttons on that.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, probably.
SPEAKER_02: Not just the TV.
SPEAKER_00: No, just everything.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: See you.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So, yeah, what's a remote control?
SPEAKER_00: It's a black thing with some buttons on it.
SPEAKER_00: It's not nothing very special.
SPEAKER_00: But...
SPEAKER_00: Well, we can try to make special.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So, do you have any ideas how it has to look for usability?
SPEAKER_03: No, I've talked about making it the same as style as the television.
SPEAKER_03: We don't have the same television all the time.
SPEAKER_03: So, that's no matter.
SPEAKER_03: If we control the FECR and DVD player player with it.
SPEAKER_03: It has to be clear.
SPEAKER_03: Because kits and elderly are going to use it.
SPEAKER_03: So, it's not only for the technical persons.
SPEAKER_03: I think it must be a very good control.
SPEAKER_03: So, you can use it from everywhere in your room.
SPEAKER_03: The infrared thing must be from very good quality.
SPEAKER_00: That's right.
SPEAKER_00: It should be a good point.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Nothing frustrated.
SPEAKER_01: And how big should it be?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: It shouldn't be too big.
SPEAKER_02: But I don't think we can make it too small.
SPEAKER_02: Because it has to have a lot of functions.
SPEAKER_02: We can't make it smaller than things we know, I think.
SPEAKER_00: Just big enough for the buttons we have.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Or we have to make something like mobile phones that you can fold it open.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe then you can make it smaller and you're weaker.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe more trendy.
SPEAKER_00: You think about one you can fold open.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Or you can see more options.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe for the DVD player or something.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Or you can just generate general things like volume and TV channels.
SPEAKER_02: And inside things you don't use that often.
SPEAKER_01: Or you could think of a small touchscreen on the remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Why should you use a touchscreen on the remote control?
SPEAKER_01: Maybe it's making a menu in it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Or maybe to keep it easy and small.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I can't have to put a touchscreen on it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe it would be a bit...
SPEAKER_03: It's not reachable, I think.
SPEAKER_03: And we have to care for the strength of the remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Because remote controls are most things in the house that falls down on the ground and get often broken.
SPEAKER_00: And if you have a touchscreen in it, it's definitely too much fun.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Lots of kits use it and touchscreen is not kits.
SPEAKER_03: You can put games on your remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: And how about the batteries?
SPEAKER_01: Should you put it in a rechargeer or...
SPEAKER_00: Oh, maybe not to good at it.
SPEAKER_00: Just put it on your television and just recharge.
SPEAKER_00: You never have to use any batteries.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe not to good at it.
SPEAKER_02: But we have to look at the price and I think...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: How expensive is a normal rechargeer?
SPEAKER_02: How much is your standard mobile phone rechargeer?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's a bit separately from your phone.
SPEAKER_01: It's probably expensive, but I don't know what the production costs are.
SPEAKER_00: If you look at the market, it's probably still the best way to just put batteries in it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Because the home station is a really good idea because lots of people are lose their remote control.
SPEAKER_03: And they don't know where it is.
SPEAKER_03: And now they can put it always at the same place.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe it's...therefore it's a good idea, but maybe it's expensive.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe use it as a separate option.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Sell it separately.
SPEAKER_03: You can buy it with...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but I have a mouse that's also...
SPEAKER_01: Chargable?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in a station.
SPEAKER_01: Or you can change your batteries.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_00: Option, just the option.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And then you can set something on paper already.
SPEAKER_03: Size, looks, usable.
SPEAKER_03: The buttons on usual places.
SPEAKER_03: The arm of button must be on top.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It has to lay good in the hand.
SPEAKER_03: You have to...
SPEAKER_00: Has it be...does it has to be...have to be...like...
SPEAKER_00: A different form than a normal remote controller.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if we think we have to look at that.
SPEAKER_02: Well, you can do everything in a distant way, but...
SPEAKER_03: You can make it very special to create our own.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Looks, but it's very hard to...
SPEAKER_01: If we want to make it special, we probably have to do a lot of testing if it really works.
SPEAKER_02: No, you can...
SPEAKER_02: Have the basic things on the same place.
SPEAKER_02: Like on off-button on top and the TV channels, one, two, three, four, as a block.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And then the volume, obviously, on top, so you can see.
SPEAKER_02: But the rest is...
SPEAKER_02: You don't use that often, so...
SPEAKER_02: If you have a clear button with a good icon on it, it should be clear as well.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control, I think.
SPEAKER_02: So you can do something unique with that.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and what we have to think about too is a button that you use often are...
SPEAKER_01: Maybe...
SPEAKER_01: Like when you fall it open, when you have it closed, you can still do the functions.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, or top-order.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but the basic options on top.
SPEAKER_01: Basically, when I'm watching TV, I'm just using five buttons.
SPEAKER_00: So...
SPEAKER_00: Maybe it's very hard to make it full open and to look like it's very...
SPEAKER_00: What's it called?
SPEAKER_00: Very nice.
SPEAKER_03: If you make it full open, it's also...
SPEAKER_03: The strength is not as good as a remote control.
SPEAKER_00: So maybe you have to keep it like a square, just normal remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, but yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think we have to close this to finish this meeting.
SPEAKER_00: There's some more things.
SPEAKER_00: We have another 30 minutes, so then we're going to meet again.
SPEAKER_00: So you know what you have to do?
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: For me, the marketing expert, the user requirements specification, do I need to think as a user, only the looks and what you want to do with it?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think if you have to know if it's for TV, DVD player, all the things.
SPEAKER_00: Also from a user, but...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, there's also about strength.
SPEAKER_02: Everything.
SPEAKER_00: So everything you want.
SPEAKER_00: It's not strength, that's something for...
SPEAKER_00: It's not for you.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: What's in the market, what's normal, what kind of...
SPEAKER_02: Do you want to do a remote control?
SPEAKER_02: Do you need any young remote control?
SPEAKER_02: I already wrote some down.
SPEAKER_03: So what is?
SPEAKER_00: Yep.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, just...
SPEAKER_00: Is that okay?
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: There's already a document in the folder.
SPEAKER_03: So you can see me too.
SPEAKER_00: So see you in 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: For the next time you have to put it exactly on the square.
SPEAKER_00: You're left on.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, Paul.
SPEAKER_02: Didn't say that.
SPEAKER_02: No, sorry.
SPEAKER_02: You're off of...
SPEAKER_03: Ciao.
SPEAKER_02: Bye bye.
None: Okay.
