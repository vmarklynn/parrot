SPEAKER_03: Ja, here we go again. Welcome.
SPEAKER_03: You have again tree presentations, and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to further remote control has to sport.
SPEAKER_03: So, let's go.
SPEAKER_04: Yes. Who wants to start?
SPEAKER_04: Me first again or?
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: Does me.
SPEAKER_04: All right.
SPEAKER_04: Very nice to meet you.
SPEAKER_04: Can anyone visit a private app?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
None: Hello.
SPEAKER_04: Hello.
SPEAKER_04: Did you hear the request given?
SPEAKER_04: Q1-2-1 – fлиxen tpying u Ponzi Q2-2 – f email Q1-2 – f blexen tpying u Ponzi Q1-2 – f furna i cod, hue, hue gre Q1-2 – f bol sparkle De de vela meins, adressen em.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, well, this is the fruit and vegetables.
SPEAKER_04: Looks are fresh, bright colors.
SPEAKER_04: So to give you an ID.
SPEAKER_04: Well, the developments, development 1.
SPEAKER_04: Well, the most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look and feel.
SPEAKER_04: Instead of the current functional look and feel.
SPEAKER_04: Well, fancy stands for an original look and feel of the case and the interface.
SPEAKER_04: And the second most important aspect is that the remote control should be technological, innovative.
SPEAKER_04: Well, it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls.
SPEAKER_04: I think we pretty much cover that with our screen and speed recognition.
SPEAKER_04: So I don't expect that to be a problem.
SPEAKER_04: The third development is that the remote control should be easy to use.
SPEAKER_04: Well, the first aspect was twice as important as the second aspect, which was twice as important as the third aspect.
SPEAKER_04: So that kind of gives you these ratios.
SPEAKER_04: So fancy look and feel is the most important point of attention.
SPEAKER_04: So the fruit and vegetables in combination with the sponsor material.
SPEAKER_04: Well, technological innovation.
SPEAKER_04: We cover that pretty much, I guess.
SPEAKER_04: And easy to use.
SPEAKER_04: I don't think that would be a problem.
SPEAKER_04: So my point of attention is especially this part that this will be correct.
SPEAKER_04: So that was the marketing presentation.
SPEAKER_04: I had only one document left.
SPEAKER_01: Did you like the first?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, no, I don't mind.
SPEAKER_04: So kind of this.
SPEAKER_04: So a small example, kind of this, nothing about the buttons, but just sponge kind of thing and some fruit and colors.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: Just made a quick design.
SPEAKER_03: Cool.
SPEAKER_03: All right.
SPEAKER_03: All right.
SPEAKER_03: I think growing.
SPEAKER_03: OK, you're just using the same.
SPEAKER_02: OK.
SPEAKER_02: Copartus.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, layout.
SPEAKER_02: What now?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's OK.
SPEAKER_03: You probably opened it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, true.
SPEAKER_02: F5.
SPEAKER_02: F5.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: So I'm dealing with the component design.
SPEAKER_02: Let's see.
SPEAKER_02: I used some design examples we had from similar products.
SPEAKER_02: And I used possibilities for our manufacturing department about current components, which will have to be implemented in the design.
SPEAKER_02: That's why I had to go first.
SPEAKER_02: Well, they gave me an idea about what people want.
SPEAKER_02: We're mainly focusing on this group, but I want to make the distinction clear.
SPEAKER_02: I could not drag the pictures into the slide source.
SPEAKER_02: So I don't have examples of how it looks like.
SPEAKER_02: But it comes down to what you think we should do with the spongy and the fruity-looking type.
SPEAKER_02: If the young dynamic people want soft primary colors, which look like fruits, you know, you can and shapes that are curved and not saw it straight-lined anymore.
SPEAKER_02: So this basically goes on to what you were mentioning earlier.
SPEAKER_02: There's a lot of factors involved in choosing the components.
SPEAKER_02: There's a lot of options that we have to discuss.
SPEAKER_02: For example, the energy source.
SPEAKER_02: We have four types.
SPEAKER_02: The basic battery.
SPEAKER_02: We have a hand dynamo, which we do not refer to it as the Knife God.
SPEAKER_02: The kinetic provision of energy, which means if you move the thing, if you shake it, which will be fun for toddlers, right?
SPEAKER_02: If they want to use the.
SPEAKER_02: And of course, so are ourselves.
SPEAKER_02: But I don't know how we would use that into the design of the actual product.
SPEAKER_02: So indoors.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, also in countries where it isn't much light, like in Scandinavia, they wouldn't be able to use it half of the year, you know?
SPEAKER_02: So that's not cool either.
SPEAKER_02: So for the case, there's the traditional uncarved flat hard case, single curved, which means that it has curves in one dimension or the double curves.
SPEAKER_02: I wasn't able to finish my personal preferences sheet, but well, you know, we will have to go for the double curved because it's daring and different from what we have now.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The case materials.
SPEAKER_02: Well, we have all kinds of hard materials, like the hard plastic, the wood and the titanium.
SPEAKER_02: I would definitely go for rubber because it fits most in what people want to see nowadays.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Poof.
SPEAKER_02: This is a lot of text.
SPEAKER_02: I wasn't able to organize this yet.
SPEAKER_02: We have several interface designs.
SPEAKER_02: We can use scroll buttons for the menus.
SPEAKER_02: But we already kind of decided to go for the push buttons for the arrow buttons.
SPEAKER_02: So that's not really interesting.
SPEAKER_02: Electronics.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe we want to decide on what electronics to use.
SPEAKER_02: The advanced chip, I think, is easiest to implement for the production because they can print it better.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think this is about it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I was working on some personal preferences.
SPEAKER_02: I first chose for the battery because, yeah, I'm traditional.
SPEAKER_02: And that's the most obvious easiest choice to go to.
SPEAKER_02: But I really think that we should maybe think about the kinetic energy where we have to move the thing to be able to use it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The additional feature.
SPEAKER_01: Or combine both with one source of energy.
SPEAKER_02: I can imagine that the kinetic type energy source would be more expensive to make.
SPEAKER_02: But it is more long-lasting that people don't have to ever buy batteries again.
SPEAKER_04: That is more fun.
SPEAKER_02: And it's also more fun.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I always chuck my remote control around.
SPEAKER_04: So just playing with it.
SPEAKER_04: And especially when the material is rubber, it can be done.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, you can't harm it.
SPEAKER_02: So it's a perfect combination.
SPEAKER_02: You don't have to be scared about bands get off the floor and breaking it or whatever.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So that's the end of it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So go ahead.
SPEAKER_04: So double-carves is like this.
SPEAKER_02: No, it means curved in two dimensions.
SPEAKER_02: So a single curved would be a square box.
SPEAKER_02: But then with curves on one dimension, and double-curved would mean that it would have curves in the eyes.
SPEAKER_01: Every direction looks really good.
SPEAKER_01: One very important thing I was thinking about is the speech option.
SPEAKER_01: We were going to use that.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So that's one thing, which I'm not sure of how to implement it into the design.
SPEAKER_03: Well, the visual representation is not there with speech.
SPEAKER_01: It has to be combined with a menu for functions.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So I think you can just match the speech commands with the functions that are already present.
SPEAKER_03: OK.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we don't think you have to design anything.
SPEAKER_01: And do the speech just for the basic options for the simple buttons for everything, also for the funds options.
SPEAKER_01: OK.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, this is our very basic trend design.
SPEAKER_01: Everybody says it.
SPEAKER_01: So that's what's.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: In the last meeting, we were putting the simple and the advanced options separated.
SPEAKER_01: It's obvious.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, pressing the menu option will disable all other options on your remote control.
SPEAKER_01: And only the LCD panel will light up.
SPEAKER_01: And then you can only change the buttons that you need to control.
SPEAKER_01: I guess.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, design has to be very attractive with that.
SPEAKER_01: Sure.
SPEAKER_01: You're hoping for it.
SPEAKER_01: OK.
SPEAKER_01: You have to do this.
SPEAKER_01: But this is the simple layout display on the upper side with the menu button and maybe some sort of cancel button or save button.
SPEAKER_01: That would be the back.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Back and OK.
SPEAKER_01: Back and OK.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: You did read the minutes, I wrote.
SPEAKER_03: You did read the minutes, I wrote.
SPEAKER_01: A little bit, I think, but not necessarily.
SPEAKER_03: Because I pretty much summed up all the buttons there.
SPEAKER_01: OK.
SPEAKER_01: So I didn't read that.
SPEAKER_03: I hate doing work for nothing.
SPEAKER_01: But this is the basic design for the buttons.
SPEAKER_01: I wanted to categorize everything with speech, display, sound, everything.
SPEAKER_01: You know that in your minutes.
SPEAKER_01: Every push button has its own lead light.
SPEAKER_01: So you can make it more trendy for younger people.
SPEAKER_01: And if there are older people, they want it more luxurious.
SPEAKER_01: So that's also an option.
SPEAKER_01: That was it.
SPEAKER_03: That was it.
SPEAKER_03: OK.
SPEAKER_03: And I'm again.
SPEAKER_03: OK.
SPEAKER_03: So what do we have to do side is what kind of components do we use?
SPEAKER_03: Energy source, chip type, case type, and user interface.
SPEAKER_03: But I didn't see a clear distinction between this.
SPEAKER_03: So I think what we have is OK.
SPEAKER_03: So we only, we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: The case would be doubly curved.
SPEAKER_03: Rubber material.
SPEAKER_03: Rubber material.
SPEAKER_03: And that's the only thing we have left.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we need the chip on print to be able to support the screen and.
SPEAKER_02: OK.
SPEAKER_02: Now it's easy.
SPEAKER_02: Audio function.
SPEAKER_04: So is that he advanced?
SPEAKER_04: Chip?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Otherwise, you would have a simple chip just for pressing it.
SPEAKER_02: But we need more.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: I'm just thinking this is not my department, but I'm not sure what this is going to cost to be able to.
SPEAKER_03: I didn't get any info this.
SPEAKER_02: Because we need to sell it for 25 euro a piece.
SPEAKER_04: It's going to be difficult, huh?
SPEAKER_04: The cost of making it should be 12 and a half.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: I didn't get any information about that.
SPEAKER_01: I don't produce it in China, so it's not problem.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Child labor, man.
SPEAKER_02: We love it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, so it doesn't.
SPEAKER_03: Let's see the new thing.
SPEAKER_04: Well, the interface type.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, the interface.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe we can.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's quite difficult because we haven't got all the options.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_03: Do you have a picture of doubly curved case?
SPEAKER_03: Can you put it in the group folder?
SPEAKER_02: Let me see.
SPEAKER_02: Let me see.
SPEAKER_04: What is that?
SPEAKER_04: If you go to your home page or something.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I'm going there now.
SPEAKER_04: Get your own information.
SPEAKER_04: Inspiration.
SPEAKER_04: I got my fresh and fruity picture.
SPEAKER_04: Also, there.
SPEAKER_04: Well, you didn't draw it yourself.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_04: Too last time.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe it's the menu.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, that was the menu I was looking at.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, maybe it's easier with an arrow.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So that indicates that there's a menu under that menu.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, perfect.
SPEAKER_03: So that's cool.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe it's easier if you guys come over here.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: See, this is the standard traditional type where the forum serves the function.
SPEAKER_02: It's really basic, but this is more appealing to old people.
SPEAKER_02: And we don't want that.
SPEAKER_02: This is what we're looking for.
SPEAKER_02: And that means curved in both dimensions.
SPEAKER_02: Not only like this, but it has to be...
SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
SPEAKER_02: It has to be kind of instead of the PlayStation module, it has to be like the GameCube, you know, where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument, and it has to be nice to hold.
SPEAKER_01: It has also to be luxurious for rich people.
SPEAKER_01: This looks a little bit like an ownership children.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but that's the problem.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the dilemma, actually, because we want to appeal to the young public with flashy colors and with a lot of shape.
SPEAKER_02: And the rubber, it will look cheap always, you know, with...
SPEAKER_01: With the colors you can make it, make the colors with the lets beneath the buttons.
SPEAKER_01: If you press the button and you can disable the core and lets for people that don't like it.
SPEAKER_02: There is mobile phones in which you can change the color also of the lights.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe we should consider this function to customize it.
SPEAKER_02: And so, I mean, kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colors.
SPEAKER_02: And people want something different, or more design.
SPEAKER_02: They can go for one color.
SPEAKER_02: For example, this photo camera.
SPEAKER_04: Cool, underwater.
SPEAKER_02: Personally, I think it's really ugly.
SPEAKER_02: Just give me the thing that it's inside there, but yeah, then maybe I'm too old for this stuff.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. So, I think are all...
SPEAKER_03: I am bright colors.
SPEAKER_02: This is with the curve that I mean.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That's singly curve.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Which would be nice.
SPEAKER_03: We could make compromise between that, but I don't know if we're with the effort.
SPEAKER_02: You compromise between what?
SPEAKER_03: Instead of doubly curve, we take a single curve.
SPEAKER_02: So, this will be a single curve.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, this is only in this dimension.
SPEAKER_04: Like this.
SPEAKER_04: So, curve here.
SPEAKER_04: Not in the eyes.
SPEAKER_04: Exactly.
SPEAKER_04: So, we keep it singly, single curve then.
SPEAKER_03: That would be an option, I don't know what you think.
SPEAKER_02: I think that...
SPEAKER_02: I mean, our aim is to make something different, right?
SPEAKER_02: To make something new.
SPEAKER_02: I would go for the double curve.
SPEAKER_02: I'm thinking, you know, a drawing palette where you have the shape for your thumb.
SPEAKER_02: So, it kind of holds nicely something like that.
SPEAKER_01: Well, this is really your decision.
SPEAKER_01: We can make more options for buttons if you have it in your hand.
SPEAKER_01: You are not only...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you don't need to want the dimension, but you can use other dimensions for pressing the buttons.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, as well.
SPEAKER_02: You can make a trigger button or something like that.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, or that is the confirmation button or something.
SPEAKER_02: That you scroll with your thumb, with the arrows, and then confirm.
SPEAKER_02: That would be a nice way to use it.
SPEAKER_02: But, I mean, yeah, I'm thinking big already and we need something...
SPEAKER_02: Well, that you can able to use in one hand, I think.
SPEAKER_04: So, from top view looks kind of like this, but from the side, you can have it also in a kind of shape.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe because the screen is on top, you can have buttons to interface.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe you can have this kind of shape, a little upwards, so that the screen is more towards yourself, so you can easily see your screen.
SPEAKER_04: How about you have it in your hand?
SPEAKER_04: So, it's kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen.
SPEAKER_04: So, then you have double...
SPEAKER_04: Double curves in some way.
SPEAKER_04: So, this is...
SPEAKER_04: This is...
SPEAKER_04: So, the screen is positioned over here.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, something like that.
SPEAKER_04: And the buttons are more...
SPEAKER_04: Oh, it's very thick now, but...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, understand what you mean.
SPEAKER_02: Let's...
SPEAKER_02: How about we do a pop-up screen like the laptop?
SPEAKER_02: So, that only the simple functions will be feasible at first.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that you can...
SPEAKER_02: If you want.
SPEAKER_02: And then it comes up or...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, something like that.
SPEAKER_03: So, you have the side view?
SPEAKER_04: But then the side view can be straight if you have a pop-up screen.
SPEAKER_04: But I don't know if that's too expensive.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I want to be able to...
SPEAKER_03: Like this.
SPEAKER_02: No, like I would draw it like this.
SPEAKER_02: Let's say this is the side view that you have a screen that will come up here and can go down that way.
SPEAKER_02: You know what I mean.
SPEAKER_02: So, that it will come up like that.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so the buttons are on top here and you flip it over that...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, or preferably even keep the simple buttons here.
SPEAKER_02: And then under the screen even...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, the other one.
SPEAKER_01: More advanced buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's good.
SPEAKER_01: More advanced options for the menu.
SPEAKER_01: For the LCD menu.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, it's not all because you need most of them, the error buttons, but you can hide the okay in the back and the menu button also because when you flip it over and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will activate the mode automatically.
SPEAKER_02: Activate the...
SPEAKER_04: So, okay, but you need some button to flip this.
SPEAKER_04: Right, you choose to make it mechanically.
SPEAKER_02: But you can make a trigger here.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and it says menu when it flips open
SPEAKER_04: and then you have the buttons to control the combination with your...
SPEAKER_01: It's not very strong. If you drop it one time...
SPEAKER_04: True, it can go open.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the idea of it was...
SPEAKER_02: Because you close it, you cover the LCD screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever.
SPEAKER_04: And it will be covered in some kind of thin rubber layer.
SPEAKER_02: Exactly, exactly.
SPEAKER_02: We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break.
SPEAKER_02: No, it's very solid.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that may work.
SPEAKER_02: That actually will offer some extra protection.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, but then we still have the thing of the shape.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I was thinking if you have your hand, if this is your...
SPEAKER_00: Harder.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, the lower part doesn't work, I guess, so maybe you should try it over there.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_02: If this is your thumb and this is your hand like that...
SPEAKER_02: With your wrist...
SPEAKER_02: That it would be kind of shaped like this, you know?
SPEAKER_02: So, it's easier to hold in your hand to...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Left hand, that's a problem.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, of course.
SPEAKER_02: Then you would have to...
SPEAKER_02: To make it like this, like you drew here.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And maybe then make this thicker also than the center, give it...
SPEAKER_02: I would give it a female shape, but yeah.
SPEAKER_03: If you will shape it, if too...
SPEAKER_03: Obviously.
SPEAKER_01: It could make some more appealing to guys.
SPEAKER_01: Which you can change.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but that's optional for later, I guess.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but we have hardware inside, which is...
SPEAKER_02: So it has to have some sort of basic shape.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we better...
SPEAKER_02: And also the screen, you can unmold it.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, so, okay, we should better choose one shape.
SPEAKER_04: But that's kind of the idea, so it lays good in the hand.
SPEAKER_02: And then on the side with your thumb...
SPEAKER_04: It lays the screen here, where you can...
SPEAKER_04: You can use the button.
SPEAKER_03: So the key options are primary colors.
SPEAKER_02: And then I would...
SPEAKER_02: Spongebob.
SPEAKER_02: I would do the arrows here, kind of thing.
SPEAKER_02: Spongebob can be raised by himself.
SPEAKER_02: And the simple buttons here.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And the control things in the middle, the arrows?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's what I mean, the arrows over here.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and here the numbers.
SPEAKER_04: Simple, okay.
SPEAKER_04: All right.
SPEAKER_03: I think that's a nice design.
SPEAKER_03: Pretty nice design.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: That's cool.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, that looks pretty fancy.
SPEAKER_02: Or do we want to make a shape look like a banana or something?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, this.
SPEAKER_04: Bananas are weird shape and other fruits also.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: It's better to have some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary colors.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know what colors should the basic print be like.
SPEAKER_04: Some soft green or something or...
SPEAKER_01: And then...
SPEAKER_01: Or a dark blue or...
SPEAKER_04: Oh yeah, dark blue.
SPEAKER_04: And then...
SPEAKER_04: Should use...
SPEAKER_04: And then very bright yellow banana or an orange, green apple, stuff like that.
SPEAKER_04: It's very bright tones, I guess.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we need very primary colors, like bright red, bright yellow.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but primary colors we can create with the LEDs on the...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: If you make it just...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, give it the blue color, then it's just a neutral color, also for the more...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, for the older people.
SPEAKER_04: That doesn't really work to draw.
SPEAKER_04: I guess.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, what's this?
SPEAKER_03: This text.
None: Right.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, you have text.
SPEAKER_03: You can also make a line this.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, two hours further.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, thickness.
SPEAKER_01: And that's blue.
SPEAKER_04: Why not go for the 20?
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: That's what I call painting.
SPEAKER_04: So that's a dark blue basic color, I guess.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it is pretty nice.
SPEAKER_04: And then...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, with some yellow banana...
SPEAKER_04: And how about some flashing stand by lights?
SPEAKER_02: Like you have on the Samsung, well, I don't like to call brand phones.
SPEAKER_02: Because I remember from one of our first meetings that people lose their remote controls often.
SPEAKER_02: So not only in the colors of the LEDs that we want something to keep it feasible at all times.
SPEAKER_04: But...
SPEAKER_04: How do you mean?
SPEAKER_03: Some of the flashing colors, so you can't lose it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, exactly.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's a bit too much.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, an orange.
SPEAKER_04: All right.
SPEAKER_04: Well, this is more like purple, I guess.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: It should be more real dark blue.
SPEAKER_04: So the contrast with the fruit of Jackson is pretty high.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So, yeah, this would be a nice device, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: So, the color shoots and should I give that display?
SPEAKER_04: I mean, the color of the background of this display.
SPEAKER_04: Well, I don't guess it has to be...
SPEAKER_04: 60...
SPEAKER_04:...65,000 colors.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, too expensive.
SPEAKER_04: So, just a blue, blue backlight or something like that.
SPEAKER_04: Green is too old-fashioned, but blue.
SPEAKER_02: As long as you use high contrast between the background and the foreground color.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So, that people with...
SPEAKER_01: White backlight?
SPEAKER_04: White backlight and dark.
SPEAKER_01: Dark letters.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Whatever, which is visible.
SPEAKER_04: I know you should test it under a light condition, I mean, it's hard to tell.
SPEAKER_02: And also for people who are a bit color blind.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, it's obviously red and green, I believe.
SPEAKER_04: Which colors should the buttons be?
SPEAKER_01: That's adjustable.
SPEAKER_04: Whoa.
SPEAKER_04: White just...
SPEAKER_04: All buttons?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: No, no.
SPEAKER_01: That's how we are going to make it a more trendy.
SPEAKER_01: What?
SPEAKER_01: Or is that too expensive?
SPEAKER_04: Maybe, I mean, they have to...
SPEAKER_04: They have to have some color, right?
SPEAKER_04: And if the background is very dark blue.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe green.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe we want to make the background the bright colors.
SPEAKER_02: So, the total thing is very bright.
SPEAKER_02: Like the pictures I showed you guys.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Those things were all bright red, red, red, flashy.
SPEAKER_04: So, more like...
SPEAKER_04: Doesn't work.
SPEAKER_04: Very well.
SPEAKER_04: More like this color.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, something like that, something like that.
SPEAKER_02: And then...
SPEAKER_04: Then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something.
SPEAKER_04: But then again, which colors should the buttons be?
SPEAKER_04: The press buttons.
SPEAKER_04: Should they be white or black or...
SPEAKER_01: Right, maybe.
SPEAKER_01: And it looks quite cheap.
SPEAKER_01: That's color, I think.
SPEAKER_04: The green?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but it's pretty fresh on the other side.
SPEAKER_02: It's actually pretty trendy color at the moment.
SPEAKER_04: It's trendy, I think.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: My couch is in that color.
SPEAKER_03: Ooh, this is a couch.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Well, that works pretty well.
SPEAKER_04: And then time was up.
SPEAKER_03: Right, don't you?
SPEAKER_02: Do you get a pop-up?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, within five minutes.
SPEAKER_03: That you have five minutes left or...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, left and then...
SPEAKER_03: Let's kick you out.
SPEAKER_04: So, something like this.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: That should be pretty nice color.
SPEAKER_04: But maybe the buttons...
SPEAKER_04: All buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colorblind people.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: No, this is red or green.
SPEAKER_01: But the buttons had their own lads or not.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the red and green are actually the easiest to discriminate.
SPEAKER_02: Even for colorblind.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: They will see one of each as gray.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But if you use green on blue, those kind of colors will look the same.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So red buttons are okay.
SPEAKER_01: I think so.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, that gets the default setting the red buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but I think you need to keep in mind that the lads are just extra light.
SPEAKER_04: How do you mean?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: They don't determine the color.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That much, I think.
SPEAKER_01: I think about the red lads and blue lads and blue...
SPEAKER_01: Oh, that's too busy, I guess.
SPEAKER_03: You have a background.
SPEAKER_03: Each number is transparent.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Partly, but you have to print on the number or the sign.
SPEAKER_03: So he comes...
SPEAKER_03: You better...
SPEAKER_04: You better keep the lads and the buttons itself in the same color, I guess.
SPEAKER_04: So just an extra bit of light inside the deck.
SPEAKER_04: You can...
SPEAKER_02: What we should do is make kind of a see through plastic buttons with one color the lads behind it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So that the whole button will shine as the color...
SPEAKER_02: And if you think about easy to use buttons, we have to...
SPEAKER_02: Well, we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold for both hands, but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: If you hold the machine.
SPEAKER_03: Don't mean to discourage you.
SPEAKER_03: Basically, you two are going to work on Smartboard next 30 minutes to design the design.
SPEAKER_03: Alright.
SPEAKER_03: Alright.
SPEAKER_03: And you will do the evaluation of the product, which we don't have yet.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, about.
SPEAKER_04: So, how should I do that?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Or you send it to me.
SPEAKER_03: Because you are going to design it on this board, right?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but maybe you can do the evaluation.
SPEAKER_03: You don't have to evaluate yet, but you can make a procedure which you follow.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I probably get instructions that have to do that.
SPEAKER_04: So I make another presentation, I guess.
SPEAKER_04: I know what's going to happen in life.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, so...
SPEAKER_03: You have a basic ID.
SPEAKER_03: And you two are going to do this.
SPEAKER_03: So we're going to work here on this sketchboard.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Alright.
SPEAKER_02: Thanks.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Alright, so that's where...
SPEAKER_03: I just just make a new page and be creative.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Alright.
SPEAKER_01: So you have to do it at this moment after?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you have 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Then we have to see something.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So we have to show to the management.
SPEAKER_02: What we are thinking about.
SPEAKER_02: So we make a new...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That's just a debate on this.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Or...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, just...
SPEAKER_02: Alright.
SPEAKER_03: Make a new one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Alright.
SPEAKER_02: Save this board.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I'll just keep it there.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_03: Just press save.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: It'll be fine.
SPEAKER_04: On the left.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, sorry.
SPEAKER_03: You can also use the clip art.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That's your color.
SPEAKER_02: Draw in paint or something.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Because...
SPEAKER_01: That we can make the user on the grid.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, because I have to focus on the basic look and field design.
SPEAKER_02: So how it's going to look.
SPEAKER_02: And you have to think how we're going to put the screen in it and those kind of things.
SPEAKER_02: So if I'm drawing and you think, okay, I'm not going to be able to put a screen in there.
SPEAKER_02: I guess I have to put a screen in there.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Do you mind if I draw in black then for normal sketches?
SPEAKER_04: I don't need buttons.
SPEAKER_04: I use your lines.
SPEAKER_02: I use my words.
SPEAKER_02: So we kind of want the colors.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So the plastic buttons also help.
SPEAKER_04: Because of their only...
SPEAKER_04: How much are good at drawing?
SPEAKER_04: During interaction.
SPEAKER_02: Excuse me?
SPEAKER_04: Well, it's a good thing that the buttons aren't...
SPEAKER_04: Well, that they are plastic because then you can light up the light on grid when they are usable.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe you should draw it very large like this.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, this part isn't functioning.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_02: How do we erase?
SPEAKER_02: Now, or insert text?
SPEAKER_03: I know, maybe just start typing.
SPEAKER_01: But that's a bit big, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: You also do the other sides, not only in the front side.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, exactly.
SPEAKER_03: Side view.
SPEAKER_01: Let's make first the other views.
SPEAKER_01: The front view, side view.
SPEAKER_02: I thought for the side view that the base exception would be rather...
SPEAKER_02: A bit thicker than the middle where you're holding it, because your fingers have to fit underneath.
SPEAKER_02: You know, it has to be very small.
SPEAKER_04: But then you assign it the meeting is over.
SPEAKER_02: Exactly, but the upper side has to be a bit more like that, I think.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, just play.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the display we put in here, the basic functions, and here where it's most reachable.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The arrow functions.
SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, this is hard.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I don't have to draw it exactly, do we?
SPEAKER_02: No, it's okay.
SPEAKER_02: Let me try it one more time.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe if it's easier if I draw it in one.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, of course, it will become way more ugly.
SPEAKER_01: You can make it larger.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe it's easier to draw one.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's a tech forever.
SPEAKER_02: It's fun to work with this pen.
SPEAKER_02: So larger.
SPEAKER_02: That's the basic I think.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_02: Side.
SPEAKER_03: Five minutes left before the meeting ends.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Other views?
SPEAKER_04: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit.
SPEAKER_01: That's the question.
SPEAKER_02: Let's fill in the buttons later.
SPEAKER_02: So this is going to be from the...
SPEAKER_04: Is this from the side?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Because the screen goes up like that, right?
SPEAKER_04: So then it's like this.
SPEAKER_04: Or that's not convenient.
SPEAKER_04: Then you have to screen like this and you look like the...
SPEAKER_04: It's better to have it somewhat like this.
SPEAKER_04: Or does it flip the idea?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it is.
SPEAKER_01: Or is it easier to integrate the LCD screen into this bubble?
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Because it doesn't have to flip.
SPEAKER_01: Because space for making an LCD...
SPEAKER_04: It's better to have this like this, I guess.
SPEAKER_04: And then flip it like this.
SPEAKER_01: But why do we need the flipping?
SPEAKER_02: You can adjust the angle to which it flips.
SPEAKER_02: And it can flip all the way up to there.
SPEAKER_04: So yeah.
SPEAKER_04: But we still keep the flipping mechanism.
SPEAKER_02: Thanks, huh?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we keep the flip.
SPEAKER_02: And because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: The shape is okay.
SPEAKER_01: But yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I don't see the...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Why we shoot used the flipping mechanism.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I thought it would be cool.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's for...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but maybe...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but maybe we should then...
SPEAKER_01: Because we have enough space here.
SPEAKER_01: We got the basic functions.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, they are the middle.
SPEAKER_01: The arrow...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Shouldn't we integrate it?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, and then...
SPEAKER_04: We should...
SPEAKER_04: Like...
SPEAKER_04: Oh.
SPEAKER_04: Dude.
SPEAKER_04: Come on.
SPEAKER_04: So this is the shape.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, it has a...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's not working.
SPEAKER_02: It doesn't end so well.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side, it doesn't fall on the screen.
SPEAKER_04: So there's a layer of rubber on the sides.
SPEAKER_04: Definitely.
SPEAKER_04: So no flipping.
SPEAKER_04: No flipping or no flipping.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You wanted the flipping, so...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I guess, but I mean, most folks can, right?
SPEAKER_01: If you drop it, it just breaks.
SPEAKER_01: And it has to be very strong because of the...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it's a bit strong and the kinetic.
SPEAKER_04: So you better make it, be better make it like this.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, if you go for the connect...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, for the children, it's...
SPEAKER_01: For people not 16 years.
SPEAKER_04: They're already responsible enough to have a mobile phone, so also to deal with their remote controller.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah?
SPEAKER_02: Well, yeah, I'm just thinking totally different designs also.
SPEAKER_02: Remember that the weird pocket phone thing here, which...
SPEAKER_02: It's like kind of a gameboy, they will shit try something like that.
SPEAKER_03: I thought up a name for our product.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's called the real remote.
SPEAKER_03: Ooh, all right.
SPEAKER_03: Copyright sign of the real.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: All right.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I like it.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe you can include that somewhere.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, we should work on our own right.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah, we have some included in our designs as well.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we'll see.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: How's that?
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: See you two half an hour.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Good luck.
None: Yep.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, that's a side.
SPEAKER_01: Ah, it's okay.
SPEAKER_01: But do we want options on the other side with a little bit of buttons?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Or I just think we do.
SPEAKER_01: Could make an infolume button scroll.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, or also scrolling for the...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: We kind of wanted to stick with the...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: I'm just thinking if we want to make something different, right?
SPEAKER_02: So with the scroll is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you are going to design it.
