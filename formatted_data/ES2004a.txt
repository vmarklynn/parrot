None: We're not like to do the lights.
SPEAKER_02: You can see that in the better.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Am I supposed to be standing up there?
SPEAKER_01: So you've got both of these clipped on.
SPEAKER_01: She's going to hold on to me.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'll go.
SPEAKER_01: This is my birthday.
None: Yeah.
None: God.
SPEAKER_01: I'm just going to fall off.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Hello everybody.
SPEAKER_02: I'm Sarah, Project Manager.
SPEAKER_02: And this is our first meeting.
SPEAKER_02: It's a surprising event.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, this is our agenda.
SPEAKER_02: We will do some stuff, get to know each other a bit better.
SPEAKER_02: We'll come to each other.
SPEAKER_02: Then we'll go do two training, talk about the project plan, discuss our own ideas and everything.
SPEAKER_02: And we've got 25 minutes to do that as far as I can understand.
SPEAKER_02: Now we're developing a welcome approach.
SPEAKER_02: You probably already know.
SPEAKER_02: We want it to be original.
SPEAKER_02: Some people haven't saw it.
SPEAKER_02: It's not out in the shops.
SPEAKER_02: It's a trendy, appealing to a wide market, but not a hunk of metal.
SPEAKER_02: And user-friendly, granny, two kids, maybe even creatures, should be able to use it.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: First is the functional design.
SPEAKER_02: This is where we all go off into our individual work.
SPEAKER_02: What needs need to be fulfilled by the product.
SPEAKER_02: What effect the product has to have.
SPEAKER_02: And how it's actually going to do that.
SPEAKER_02: Conceptual design, what we're thinking, how it's going to go.
SPEAKER_02: And then the detailed design, how we're actually going to put it into practice and make it work.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: We're going to practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the whiteboard, our girlfriend.
SPEAKER_02: And some of the characteristics of that animal.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And the space for everyone else.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not going to ask you to guess I'm going to tell you that supposed to be a tiger.
SPEAKER_02: And I see them as majestic.
SPEAKER_02: And independent.
SPEAKER_02: And proud.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I kind of talk.
SPEAKER_03: It's actually sitting.
SPEAKER_03: It's not standing.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
None: I see it as one thing.
SPEAKER_03: It's very supportive.
SPEAKER_03: It's your best friend in you.
SPEAKER_03: You can talk to a dog.
SPEAKER_03: It can be a best friend.
SPEAKER_03: It doesn't discriminate between you based on what you are.
SPEAKER_03: Second, it's loyal.
SPEAKER_03: And third thing, it's got intuition.
SPEAKER_03: I mean dogs can sometimes make out between a thief and a person.
SPEAKER_03: So basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Please, please leave me a space at the bottom.
SPEAKER_01: I'm a little.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: We're standing on a chair.
SPEAKER_00: I think I'm going to have to change.
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to have to change.
None: You can go around them.
SPEAKER_00: And also my drawing skill isn't that great.
SPEAKER_01: As you can see, the quality of the work today.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's standing.
SPEAKER_00: We're good.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Now I'm going to have to change what it was originally to be.
None: Because that looks like a beak.
SPEAKER_01: Crocodile.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it can be a crocodile.
SPEAKER_00: It can be a crocodile.
SPEAKER_00: It was in the first place.
SPEAKER_00: It was an attempt to a tea rigs.
SPEAKER_00: And then it's sort of changed into a pelican, but it can be a crocodile.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And I have to think on the spot of things that is scary.
SPEAKER_00: A strong.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's funny.
SPEAKER_00: I think I'm going to have to change.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I'm very impressed with your artistic skills.
SPEAKER_01: Mine's a dreadful.
SPEAKER_01: Oops, this is now coming apart.
SPEAKER_01: I just put the top in.
SPEAKER_01: I'll put that clicks in.
SPEAKER_01: I'll hold it on.
SPEAKER_01: Oops.
SPEAKER_01: Oh dear.
SPEAKER_01: What happened there?
SPEAKER_02: Technical help.
SPEAKER_01: Hopefully I'll stay on 200 versions.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Again, this is off the top of my head.
SPEAKER_01: I was going to do a big count too.
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to do a big count.
SPEAKER_01: It's not a vampire bat, honestly.
SPEAKER_01: Somewhere there's a body behind.
SPEAKER_00: That's the worst.
SPEAKER_01: It's meant to be an eagle.
SPEAKER_01: You can tell it's a flying animal.
SPEAKER_01: Could have been a seagull.
SPEAKER_01: I never thought of a seagull.
SPEAKER_01: Again, I'm thinking on my feet.
SPEAKER_01: Goodness.
SPEAKER_01: I suppose they're also independent.
SPEAKER_01: I'll put that one down again.
SPEAKER_01: Dada.
SPEAKER_01: Um.
SPEAKER_01: They're good at golf.
SPEAKER_01: They're dependent.
SPEAKER_01: Independent, right?
SPEAKER_01: Did you say they're good at golf?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think.
SPEAKER_00: They're good.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, right.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not good at golf.
SPEAKER_01: I'll say they're quite free-spirited.
SPEAKER_01: Flying around everywhere.
SPEAKER_01: Doing their own thing.
None: And birds of prey, aren't they?
None: Oh dear.
SPEAKER_01: Intrappered.
SPEAKER_01: Intrappered.
SPEAKER_01: There we go.
SPEAKER_01: I hope that pen's going to be okay.
None: Whoops.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: That was fine.
None: Right.
SPEAKER_01: Finance-wise, we've got a lot of money.
SPEAKER_02: 17.
SPEAKER_02: 17.
SPEAKER_02: One point four you know would make a bond or something?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, saying that.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, about 17.
SPEAKER_03: 17 pounds.
SPEAKER_00: Should we be making notes of this?
SPEAKER_00: We can just refer to this later.
SPEAKER_01: I think so.
SPEAKER_02: I'd be able to put the app on a shared folder.
SPEAKER_00: Having said that, though, if you want to get one of those, the ones on the market, the moment, that's there about 20 pounds anyway.
SPEAKER_00: Right.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we have one.
SPEAKER_01: So I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price.
SPEAKER_01: Or is it going to make our product look cheapy-cheapy-option?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Production costs at 1250.
SPEAKER_02: So for the huge margin.
SPEAKER_02: Half of the selling prices.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Taking that by building it.
SPEAKER_02: And profit aim is 15 million euros, which is that?
SPEAKER_01: You know, first year.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I presume so.
SPEAKER_01: You've got market range international.
SPEAKER_01: And you did say earlier it's got to be accessible and usable by all age groups.
SPEAKER_01: We're not focusing on business market.
SPEAKER_01: Any particular thing.
SPEAKER_01: It's everyone.
SPEAKER_01: Use a friend of everyone.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Big target group.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think we have to...
SPEAKER_02: I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that.
SPEAKER_02: Making that key point.
SPEAKER_02: Just that it's going to be an international market.
SPEAKER_02: Like, that's trading America.
SPEAKER_02: Things like that.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Water New Experience is in film and controls.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, we've got...
SPEAKER_02: We have three videos, a TV and sort of amp thing.
SPEAKER_02: I'll set up.
SPEAKER_02: So we've got one of the Universal remote controls.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The program, each of you is in too.
SPEAKER_02: But that kept losing the signals.
SPEAKER_02: So we have to reprogram it every now and again.
SPEAKER_02: I think it was quite cheap as well.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That might have happened to you.
SPEAKER_02: But that was quite good.
SPEAKER_02: The fact that you could...
SPEAKER_00: You saw the ones that you have.
SPEAKER_02: You didn't have six remote controls.
SPEAKER_03: You want to do great everything into one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: My experience has only been given the remote control with the object I buy.
SPEAKER_01: Not doing any tampering with it in programming.
SPEAKER_01: Using it to program TV videos and things.
SPEAKER_01: But basically on or volume up and down.
SPEAKER_01: Channel one to that basic function.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think I could go any further with it.
SPEAKER_01: Than that.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: So there's got to be something usable by someone like me as well.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's the main stuff anyway.
SPEAKER_02: And you don't want to...
SPEAKER_02: I hate looking at a control.
SPEAKER_02: And seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words.
SPEAKER_02: And seeing what they all do.
SPEAKER_02: And just sitting there searching for the teletext button.
SPEAKER_01: And still, you don't necessarily understand symbols you're meant to understand.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_02: When you've got the main things on the front of it.
SPEAKER_02: And a section opens up for something.
SPEAKER_02: To the other functions when you can do sound.
SPEAKER_02: Or actually kind of recording things like that inside it.
SPEAKER_02: Because it doesn't make...
SPEAKER_02: When you pick it up, it doesn't make it really complicated to look at.
SPEAKER_02: It's obvious.
SPEAKER_02: What you're doing.
SPEAKER_02: Actually, that just raises a point.
SPEAKER_01: I wonder what our design people think.
SPEAKER_01: But you know on a mobile phone, you can press the key.
SPEAKER_01: And it gives you a menu.
SPEAKER_01: It's got a menu display.
SPEAKER_01: I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful.
SPEAKER_01: So you've got a little LCD display.
SPEAKER_03: I was thinking of the same lines.
SPEAKER_03: You instead of having too many buttons and make it complicated for the user.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe you have an LCD display or something like that, like a mobile.
SPEAKER_03: With menus.
SPEAKER_01: And with menus.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And if it's somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone, people might find it easier to browse and navigate also.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: What about the older generation?
SPEAKER_02: What about Granny and Grandex?
SPEAKER_02: I don't understand.
SPEAKER_02: My Grandex can answer his mobile phone.
SPEAKER_02: He couldn't even dream of texting or something like that.
SPEAKER_01: Can he program his remote controller?
SPEAKER_01: Is he basic with that too?
SPEAKER_02: I don't think they're taping.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: My Grandex is better than me using teletax.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: So that's a problem, regardless of any design modifications you come up with.
SPEAKER_01: That's going to be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps.
SPEAKER_01: And that's another issue over time.
SPEAKER_00: Well, it just needs to be as long as it's self intuitive.
SPEAKER_00: And you can work out why everything's doing.
SPEAKER_00: Because I mean menus on sort of neat phones now.
SPEAKER_00: They're still got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know how.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know how.
SPEAKER_02: I don't like the new phones that kind of got a windows based running system.
SPEAKER_02: I find it really confusing.
SPEAKER_02: I kept getting lost in the phone.
SPEAKER_02: I have not got a new one but my friend got a new one.
SPEAKER_02: And I was trying to do things with it.
SPEAKER_02: And I just kept getting lost.
SPEAKER_02: But that's just me.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know how for 25 or 12 euros 50, how much of an excellent screen you could get.
SPEAKER_00: You'd have to so keep it down to a black and white LCD thing in your room.
SPEAKER_01: Is it possible that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for a large print like you do in large print books?
SPEAKER_01: Obviously it displays less on the screen.
SPEAKER_01: It displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Or what about kind of a dual function in that you've got the basic buttons just for your play volume program things?
SPEAKER_02: And also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures, obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that.
SPEAKER_01: The other thing is just tucking into mobile phone design features again.
SPEAKER_01: You could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the flip over.
SPEAKER_02: I think that's a cost of thing.
SPEAKER_03: How much are you going to know about?
SPEAKER_03: It might save a bit of space instead of looking bulkier, it might look small.
SPEAKER_01: But it might have some cost implications.
SPEAKER_01: And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone.
SPEAKER_01: It can still be lightweight plastic, you know, something that's easily molded and produced.
SPEAKER_01: Sorry, I'm trying on your territory guys.
SPEAKER_02: Right, okay, we've got half there for the next meeting.
SPEAKER_02: So we're all going to go off and do our individual things.
SPEAKER_02: I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and meet again.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And I get to do another fantastic presentation.
SPEAKER_00: Just a quick thing about the, what you're saying about the, doesn't need to be fashionable.
SPEAKER_00: So I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the, we put the fashion into electronics.
SPEAKER_00: I think the whole design thing might be fine.
SPEAKER_00: Sure.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, you can still have plastic and it looks quite good.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, it doesn't have to be, you know, that that was my main point.
SPEAKER_01: We do have to use metal.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper, I presume it would.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, the sky will look like controls.
SPEAKER_02: And they're kind of molded and look a bit different than the telewesteral control to fill up a plastic.
SPEAKER_02: It looks a bit slotted.
SPEAKER_02: So yeah, I guess that's a second.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So let's break up there.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So see you in half an hour.
SPEAKER_01: Do we go back to our roofing system?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
None: Okay.
