None: Back end of an elephant.
SPEAKER_02: Oh my gosh.
SPEAKER_05: I've never got a new straw that well.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. And you want to write up on there?
SPEAKER_05: It says you've got to sum up your favorite characteristics of that animal.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. It's big.
SPEAKER_04: It's got a great memory.
SPEAKER_04: Is it?
SPEAKER_04: Oh.
SPEAKER_04: It's supposed to have a great memory.
SPEAKER_04: You say an elephant never forgets.

SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So, um.
SPEAKER_02: Do you want to use the white...

SPEAKER_00: A combination of a lion and tiger.
SPEAKER_05: All right.
SPEAKER_00: You've not seen Napoleon Dynamite.
SPEAKER_00: No.
SPEAKER_00: That's a hilarious memory.
SPEAKER_00: You have to see it.
SPEAKER_00: And, it's best characteristic is...
SPEAKER_00: And, it's pretty much the awesomest animal.
SPEAKER_00: But, you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. Well done.
None: Great.
SPEAKER_02: Me?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
None: Miss Mark Singh.

SPEAKER_05: Well, I'll try my best.
SPEAKER_05: To draw.
SPEAKER_05: Can I just draw the face?
SPEAKER_02: Um.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think you can just draw the face.
SPEAKER_02: But then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks.
SPEAKER_02: Oh.
SPEAKER_02: To cap.
SPEAKER_05: That's a very silly cap.
SPEAKER_05: Which also has what a big fat body and...
SPEAKER_02: A long tail.
SPEAKER_05: Okay. Do you want to do some...
SPEAKER_05: Right.
SPEAKER_05: Do you want to just write some words about it?
SPEAKER_05: Why?
SPEAKER_02: Because, um, cuddly?
SPEAKER_05: And usually caps are very friendly, usually.
SPEAKER_05: And the healing law, the heal.
None: And they can feel when the humans...
SPEAKER_05: Wow.
SPEAKER_05: Problems.
SPEAKER_05: They can't be spiritual.
SPEAKER_05: So, that's why I like caps.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, done.
SPEAKER_02: There we are.
SPEAKER_05: Sleep.
SPEAKER_05: Do do do do do do.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Um, I don't actually have a favourite animal for the...
SPEAKER_02: For the... for the... for the meeting else.
SPEAKER_02: Draw...
SPEAKER_02: A little...
SPEAKER_01: Uh...
SPEAKER_01: I honestly can't draw for toffee.
SPEAKER_01: Uh...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: In fact, nope.
SPEAKER_02: It's just...
SPEAKER_02: A prairie dad?
SPEAKER_02: Nope.
SPEAKER_02: Uh...
SPEAKER_02: That's cool.
SPEAKER_02: That's exactly what it is.
None: Not a very good one.
SPEAKER_04: Not bad, I would say.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's pretty good.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, well, you got it.
None: It's a...
SPEAKER_01: It's a skull.
SPEAKER_01: And I like them because they're cute.
SPEAKER_01: And stupid.
SPEAKER_03: Very good.
SPEAKER_03: Ah.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So, I guess that was the test to see if this equipment was all working.
SPEAKER_02: Uh...
None: Hmm.
SPEAKER_02: Let's move on to the next page.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, project finance.
SPEAKER_02: Selling price is 25 euros.
SPEAKER_02: I bet aim...
SPEAKER_02: 50 million euros.
SPEAKER_05: Like a random tenacily...
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, production costs...
SPEAKER_02: I...
SPEAKER_02: Can't cost any more than 1250 to make.
SPEAKER_02: We're going to build experience with remote control.
SPEAKER_02: So, talk about who's used luck.
SPEAKER_02: Any ideas?
SPEAKER_02: Stuff like that.
SPEAKER_02: Next meeting starts in 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_01: At coach 12.
SPEAKER_00: I think before we close, uh, we're expected...
SPEAKER_00: I mean, the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our...
SPEAKER_00: What our ideas were.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, if you want to go back to the last slide.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think we're...
SPEAKER_00: I think we're going to have to stick them up with some ideas for...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion right now.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_02: I thought this was just given us instructions for them to do next.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think this is just the preliminary...
SPEAKER_00: Get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been...
SPEAKER_00: And what we would...
SPEAKER_00: Roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: This is with remote controls then.
SPEAKER_02: Pretty much everybody here with our games.
SPEAKER_03: Is this a TV one we're supposed to make?
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, it's a TV remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: A new remote control for TV.
SPEAKER_05: What would I like?
SPEAKER_05: What?
SPEAKER_05: Um...
SPEAKER_02: You want it big? Do you want it small?
SPEAKER_02: Medium.
SPEAKER_02: Are we going for like telephones or going little teeny tiny things?
SPEAKER_02: Or are we going for something that's big and...
SPEAKER_00: It seems like there's like...
SPEAKER_00: There's sort of a tension between two ideas.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, you want one remote that maybe can work all of the functions of TV.
SPEAKER_00: And if you have whatever associated with the TV, the DVD players...
SPEAKER_00: Video.
SPEAKER_00: It's the same time you don't want a really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That's the other thing is it's going to be cheap.
SPEAKER_02: Because I was thinking something that's got different...
SPEAKER_02: Like maybe an LCD display on it that's got different pages for different devices.
SPEAKER_02: But that would probably be quite expensive.
SPEAKER_03: But how do we know how much...
SPEAKER_03: I mean, how much do we have per...
SPEAKER_03: How much?
SPEAKER_00: You can't be more than $1.250 per unit.
SPEAKER_02: Per unit, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So do we have to be realistic within the budget for...
SPEAKER_02: Well, at the moment, we could...
SPEAKER_02: I mean, because we...
SPEAKER_02: This is what we're doing at the moment. It's just saying what we'd like.
SPEAKER_02: And then after we've found out what we can like, some different ideas...
SPEAKER_02: We've researched to find out if any of these ideas are feasible or not.
SPEAKER_02: So it would be nice to have something that controls lots of different things.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Couldn't we have like one that comes out?
SPEAKER_05: Like, so you have one in...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: It doesn't have to be really thick. I mean, rock controls can be thin bits.
SPEAKER_05: And then you have one of your DVD and you sort of slide it out.
SPEAKER_05: And then it all comes compact.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, that's the line.
SPEAKER_05: So it's not...
SPEAKER_05: You're actually just putting three or four different remotes together, but making them thinner and into one.
SPEAKER_05: That's the idea.
SPEAKER_05: So you just flip them out.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Well, have one very complicated one on one side with all the DVD and VCR, and then on the other side, one remote control, that would be very, very simple.
SPEAKER_04: It's just the channel program plus and minus.
SPEAKER_04: And then just the mute button, for example.
SPEAKER_04: I can really, really, really simple on one side.
SPEAKER_04: And the other side would be very complicated.
SPEAKER_02: One side for kids, one side for adults.
SPEAKER_02: I'm actually...
SPEAKER_04: Of grandma as well, you know.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two-sided remote, because it would be very hard to use in a way that you...
SPEAKER_04: No, but you would slide it into something...
SPEAKER_04: Like something on the back would hold.
SPEAKER_04: Like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons.
SPEAKER_02: Like it or something like a flip telephone, something like that, maybe.
SPEAKER_05: That'd be cool.
SPEAKER_02: Flip it open and you've got all the buttons or you flip it closed and you've just got their basic buttons on the outside, maybe.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, we've got five minutes left.
SPEAKER_03: Start breaking up.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Well, we've got a few ideas there.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we should...
SPEAKER_00: I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a rough conceptual.
SPEAKER_00: The stage one was technical functions designed, what effect the apperata should have.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So I mean, we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface.
SPEAKER_00: But the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the TV but also devices connected to the TV.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: We'll be able to operate the DVD players.
SPEAKER_00: Things like that.
SPEAKER_02: I think we should also have a backup plan of...
SPEAKER_02: I just think that it might be expensive to make something that...
SPEAKER_02: I mean, we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything.
SPEAKER_02: We should have a backup plan of just a really good television remote control that is just for a TV but it's just a really good, nice one.
SPEAKER_02: What do you reckon?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I'm just thinking, Baron, we have something that's cheap to make.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's true.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe we should just concentrate on having a good TV remote and have it be...
SPEAKER_02: I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker.
SPEAKER_00: Have it be like ergonomic.
SPEAKER_00: It's comfortable to use, simple to use and looks decent.
SPEAKER_05: We know maybe...
SPEAKER_05: We'll make it interesting for people to buy though.
SPEAKER_02: Or maybe even something that's for disabled people or some people that don't see very well or...
SPEAKER_02: Big buttons for touchy buttons for...
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to find a niche for our remote like market it to a certain kind of people.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, just one that looks really fucking cool.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, no, I think you're in.
SPEAKER_04: Could be really light or, I don't know, sometimes, special.
SPEAKER_00: Rather than focus on...
SPEAKER_02: Otherwise, we'll be talking about how to do this and do that.
SPEAKER_02: I think we should...
SPEAKER_04: It will be end of the day if it says just TV remote doesn't say combination at all.
SPEAKER_02: Obviously everyone...
SPEAKER_02: Sounds like we're all a bit gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once.
SPEAKER_00: But remote's spinning out from other remotes.
SPEAKER_00: Having a little nested remotes and say, yeah, that's right.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, I'd like one that makes tea as well, but that's not going to happen.
SPEAKER_05: I think a flip up thing, because you always have this problem of like if it's on the...
SPEAKER_05: Well, I didn't know it.
SPEAKER_05: Like we had five or six remotes and they'd be lying on the couch and you'd come and sit down and...
SPEAKER_05: Oh, the television switch down or something.
SPEAKER_05: So maybe something that like...
SPEAKER_05: Does have a lid or closes so you don't accidentally press a button or...
SPEAKER_02: Okay, like a lot functional it like you have when you're telephones.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: But make it like really snazzy and cool with people who want it.
SPEAKER_05: So make it, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's going to be sellable.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's true.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, it doesn't have to have a flip function.
SPEAKER_00: It can just have a lock function so that it's not usable when you don't want it to be used.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: And even for kids as well, it's safer for them, I guess.
SPEAKER_05: Like they don't flick onto channels that are not allowed to flick onto.
SPEAKER_02: No porn channel for children.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: All right, so we've got some ideas.
SPEAKER_02: I guess that's move on.
SPEAKER_02: Let's close that.
SPEAKER_01: What does ID, VID and E stand for?
SPEAKER_02: Industrial designer.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Which is...
SPEAKER_05: These are kind of specific.
SPEAKER_05: And I'm marketing.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: There you go.
SPEAKER_02: So let's...
SPEAKER_02: Use your interface designer.
SPEAKER_02: That's me.
SPEAKER_02: That's...
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: That's you.
SPEAKER_02: So you're going to be the one that's working out what buttons we need.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: Industrial designer.
SPEAKER_02: You're the one that...
SPEAKER_02: You know, you're going to be working out kind of box it goes in, I guess.
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_02: Whether it's...
SPEAKER_02: I...
SPEAKER_02: What goes into the box somehow?
SPEAKER_03: How it works.
SPEAKER_02: And the marketing.
SPEAKER_05: These are quite...
SPEAKER_01: These are quite...
SPEAKER_05: So what the user requires...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, what?
SPEAKER_00: And what?
SPEAKER_00: Right, okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's...
SPEAKER_00: I guess.
SPEAKER_00: You two...
SPEAKER_02: You two are going to be...
SPEAKER_02: I think you just double...
SPEAKER_02: You know, you're working together.
SPEAKER_02: You're the one that's going to go and find out...
SPEAKER_02: Do the research.
SPEAKER_02: See what people want in a remote.
SPEAKER_02: What buttons are used more often and stuff like that.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, we've been warned to finish the meeting now.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, everyone.
SPEAKER_02: Well done.
SPEAKER_00: Good meeting.
SPEAKER_00: All right.
None: See you in 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So, do we take this off?
SPEAKER_05: I don't.
