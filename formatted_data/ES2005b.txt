SPEAKER_03: It's from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on rules for each of you.
SPEAKER_03: However, there are some changes that I've got from on high that are a bit there.
SPEAKER_03: What I didn't actually realize was that this is for a specific television.
SPEAKER_03: So they're all in one idea because I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: And they require that they...
SPEAKER_03: I'll get to that as you see it's point number four.
SPEAKER_03: And we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we're going to do from it.
SPEAKER_03: So presentations, were you...
SPEAKER_03: Anybody got?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Wearing to go?
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I need to plug you in.
SPEAKER_03: I'm not just a...
SPEAKER_03: It's a...
SPEAKER_02: A inspired design.
SPEAKER_03: Do you want me to move?
SPEAKER_03: I'm just going to screw it in.
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to swap it in.
SPEAKER_03: With function F8.
SPEAKER_03: Let's see, we blew one of the hearts out of the F8.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Me again, Raj as a marketing expert.
SPEAKER_00: As we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out.
SPEAKER_03: Someone's fine.
SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry.
SPEAKER_00: I have to look at the market potential for this product.
SPEAKER_00: Consumer likings and everything.
SPEAKER_00: What is the potential for this product?
SPEAKER_00: Are we able to achieve this our net profit or our aim?
SPEAKER_03: Then...
SPEAKER_00: Press F5 to start.
SPEAKER_00: Then the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey.
SPEAKER_00: A detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings.
SPEAKER_00: But they prefer, but they not prefer, but what problems they do encounter in all these types of things.
SPEAKER_00: And what we got first, we found that...
SPEAKER_00: But they...
SPEAKER_00: What problems they are having with the grant remote controls available in the market?
SPEAKER_00: 75% of users, they find that the remote controls available in the market are ugly.
SPEAKER_00: They are not so good looking.
SPEAKER_00: So we have to put stress on this.
SPEAKER_00: We have to take care of this factor also like our design should be appropriate, should be good looking for the consumers.
SPEAKER_00: And yes, this will definitely...
SPEAKER_00: This can definitely put in house our sales.
SPEAKER_00: And even the good thing about this is that 80% of users, they are willing to pay more for this good looking remote controls also.
SPEAKER_00: So even if the available market cost for the available remote control is less, even then we can sell it at 25 euros, which may seem quite high.
SPEAKER_00: But if our looks are...
SPEAKER_00: If the remote control we design have a better look, better designs, then we can hope that consumers will prefer these remote controls.
SPEAKER_00: And the second thing, some companies think that they should have more and more functions of the users in their remote controls.
SPEAKER_00: But rather than those having more functions in the remote controls, we should emphasize what actually consumers want, what they operate, rather than making it too complicated.
SPEAKER_00: Because mostly it has been found that 50% of the users, they use only 10% of the buttons.
SPEAKER_00: So there is no fund of having 90% buttons making the remote controls too bulky, too complicated, too expensive.
SPEAKER_00: And because I think I believe that technologies use will only if the consumers they want to use it.
SPEAKER_00: Otherwise there is no fund of having all this type of thing.
SPEAKER_00: So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls, but it will increase our profit also.
SPEAKER_00: So we have to take care of this factor also.
SPEAKER_00: It was function I want to go.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, you are going to go back just to escape.
SPEAKER_00: Then if we look at this slide, these are your shared documents.
SPEAKER_00: You can see.
SPEAKER_01: I was just going to say what was the question for us.
SPEAKER_01: Are you coming onto that?
SPEAKER_00: Look at the market potential.
SPEAKER_00: But how we should design our remote controls, what it should be there.
SPEAKER_00: So as to enhance our profit.
SPEAKER_00: So these are different age group persons.
SPEAKER_00: Like sorry, I can open it in another way.
SPEAKER_03: Speechwork here.
SPEAKER_00: If we look at the cost, whether the consumers they are willing to pay more for speech recognition in their remote control or not, we can find that the up to a 35 year age group, we have a very good disliking for this point like for speech recognition in their remote control.
SPEAKER_00: So we can emphasize on this point also.
SPEAKER_00: Because it will definitely enhance our sales in this particular age group from 15 to 35.
SPEAKER_00: And I think that most of the users of the TV are belong to this age group.
SPEAKER_00: So we should look at who buys it as well.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we can look at that factor also.
SPEAKER_03: Which other 25 to 35 is usually.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And...
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: If we look at this data, how what are the problems because the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market?
SPEAKER_00: They find that 35% of the consumers find too difficult to operate in remote control.
SPEAKER_00: So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls.
SPEAKER_00: And we should provide proper manuals, files, use also.
SPEAKER_00: So as that consumers could easily learn and need not to have any much technical knowledge to see to know how to operate these remote controls.
SPEAKER_00: So this is also a very major factor to take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales.
SPEAKER_00: So this is all about market potential by me.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, thank you.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, that's cool.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, so we do.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if the cable's going to be long.
SPEAKER_01: I just can't get over whatever runs or underneath.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, and then what do I press F8?
SPEAKER_00: F8.
SPEAKER_01: Function F8.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, cool.
SPEAKER_00: It's not coming up.
SPEAKER_00: Function F8, again.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, no signal.
SPEAKER_00: There you go.
SPEAKER_00: Computer.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, and then how do I press the big one to get it off to the F5?
SPEAKER_01: F5, and I press that again to get it all.
SPEAKER_03: F5, and the cable bring it back and just the left button for advancing.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so I'm the interface designer user interface designer.
SPEAKER_01: I'm concerned with what effect the operator should have on the user.
SPEAKER_01: I'm also, I want to point out that our motto put the fashion in electronics.
SPEAKER_01: And then we're going to make a product that's trendy and fashionable.
SPEAKER_01: And how do I press the next button?
SPEAKER_01: Just a left there.
SPEAKER_01: So I looked at existing designs and also the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like, what people dislike.
SPEAKER_01: What people fashionable because we said people between 25 and 35 were the main buyers of our TV, I think.
SPEAKER_01: So what they like and what they find fashionable and ergonomics research.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know, I haven't actually been able to do any of this myself, but maybe that comes up, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: And the findings, well, that was a basic function, send messages to the television set.
SPEAKER_01: That's what people want to do.
SPEAKER_01: So they need to be included.
SPEAKER_01: But I've got some pictures here of some leading ones.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know how to get some.
SPEAKER_03: If you're a scape, then you can see your bar.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, okay, cool.
SPEAKER_01: I've got the glasses.
SPEAKER_01: I hope it fits.
SPEAKER_01: These are two leading remote controls at the moment.
SPEAKER_01: You know, they're gray.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, this one's got loads of buttons.
SPEAKER_01: It's hard to tell from here what they actually do.
SPEAKER_01: And they're doing very exciting at all.
SPEAKER_01: Personally, I prefer this one just because it's no easier to use.
SPEAKER_01: It's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff.
SPEAKER_01: But there you go.
SPEAKER_01: I think we can do much better than that.
SPEAKER_01: I hope so.
SPEAKER_01: Hang on.
SPEAKER_01: F5.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, sorry.
SPEAKER_01: Personal preferences.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I think we need to, I think the ergonomics is quite important.
SPEAKER_03: Particularly, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: There was a bit in the RSI and things as well.
SPEAKER_01: And I thought not too edgy and like a box, more kind of handheld, more.
SPEAKER_01: Not as a computer and organic.
SPEAKER_01: Organic, yeah, more organic shape, I think.
SPEAKER_01: Simple designs.
SPEAKER_01: Like the last one we just saw, not too many buttons.
SPEAKER_01: And as a Raj point out, only 10%, 50% of people only use 10% of the buttons.
SPEAKER_01: So I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and how nice it is.
SPEAKER_01: Handheld and portable, I think, is important.
SPEAKER_01: Because TFT have just released, I think, is it a remote control for presentations or a big screen?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, not so many, anyway.
SPEAKER_01: So handheld and portable.
SPEAKER_01: I thought about other functions for TV, but as you pointed out, people don't actually want that.
SPEAKER_03: And also the company wants to keep it stuck to the TV for, to keep them stuck to the TV.
SPEAKER_01: It's the one TV.
SPEAKER_01: And so the last thing I thought, which I quickly mentioned in the other one, was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people, like blowing the dark.
SPEAKER_01: Which does already exist, but it's not very widely used.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think easy finder with a whistle function or something or rechargeable station because it's pain when you run out of batteries.
SPEAKER_01: And I think that, yeah, that's it.
SPEAKER_02: So I noticed we talked about speech recognition and whistling.
SPEAKER_02: And I just curious now, have we done any research on how many people can whistle?
SPEAKER_02: Or is that a function we want in the remote?
SPEAKER_02: Do you have trouble whistling?
SPEAKER_02: I don't, but I know a lot of people do, really?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it just, I mean, it has to be a certain kind of whistling, too.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's whistling, too.
SPEAKER_03: So you could have the, you could have the basically instead of a whistle, if it's got the voice recognition, you could have it just, you know, where are you?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's costly though.
SPEAKER_02: Much easier thing is just any loud noise, like clapping, shouting, you know, that's good.
SPEAKER_02: And then would the response be a beep's back, or something?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, something.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I said this up, so plug it in, press F5, function F5, function F8 for the function F8.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I need to twit on the thing, you got to think?
SPEAKER_02: I think it's just lacking in.
SPEAKER_02: It's good.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So as the industrial designer, my job is to take an input from you guys.
SPEAKER_02: So it's good you went first.
SPEAKER_02: And I shot it down some notes as to what are the needs.
SPEAKER_02: And what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others.
SPEAKER_02: So Raj told us that consumers are going to spend more for fancy products.
SPEAKER_02: And we also mentioned that the current products don't always match users operating behavior.
SPEAKER_02: A lot of the buttons aren't used.
SPEAKER_02: And mention that they're not fun to use.
SPEAKER_02: And a novel feature, which you just brought up with this automatic speech recognition feature, or noise detection feature for when you lose your remote, there could be a little microphone on it.
SPEAKER_02: And any noise over a certain threshold, it'll pick up as a distress signal from you.
SPEAKER_02: And I'll beep back and say, no, here I am.
SPEAKER_03: Sure, surely that would have to be sort of specific, rather, above a threshold.
SPEAKER_03: Because if you had a live movie on you, likely you could get it back at you.
SPEAKER_02: Well, maybe you could have a...
SPEAKER_02: That would be a consideration to take into account this.
SPEAKER_03: Sorry, didn't mean to do really either.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, well, that's for later down the road.
SPEAKER_02: And then as for the user interface, it should be trendy.
SPEAKER_02: I am not computer-y.
SPEAKER_02: So more low tech.
SPEAKER_02: And not too many buttons.
SPEAKER_02: So I took these onto consideration.
SPEAKER_02: And also I have some limitations from the boss.
SPEAKER_02: And practical limitations, which I kind of threw out the window.
SPEAKER_02: And so I did a little research.
SPEAKER_02: And unfortunately, all I had to work on was our corporate archives of the great products we've made before, which include spacecraft, coffee makers, and boat trains.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, is that what they're...
SPEAKER_02: Or high speed trains.
SPEAKER_02: Right, and having personally worked with all these products, I have a great deal of experience with the industrial design.
SPEAKER_03: If you can build spacecraft, you'll have no problem with our control.
SPEAKER_02: So I figured, just put them all together.
SPEAKER_02: We had a caffeine-powered space shuttle train transport to your TV.
SPEAKER_02: And as for the user interface problem, too many buttons.
SPEAKER_02: Give it one button.
SPEAKER_02: And it's for the cowboy and all of us.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not quite sure what the function is there.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I like that design.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, you could have a...
SPEAKER_03: Is that just switches on the speed recognition that it's entirely speech-operated?
SPEAKER_02: So I think I missed the budget thing.
SPEAKER_02: It was 15 million euros.
SPEAKER_02: And we got a sold 25 of them.
SPEAKER_01: Not a problem.
SPEAKER_03: OK, no, it's after 9 euros.
SPEAKER_03: We've got a...
SPEAKER_03: We've got a profit.
SPEAKER_03: We've got a profit.
SPEAKER_03: So we're making that at 12.5 euros a time.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I guess more realistically than.
SPEAKER_02: We need a product that's got some kind of nifty outer casing, cheap plastic.
SPEAKER_02: That should be just like a 10 to the price maybe or less.
SPEAKER_02: An energy source, which would probably just be your regular batteries.
SPEAKER_03: Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea?
SPEAKER_02: It's like a little bit stationary.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we could do that too.
SPEAKER_02: I hadn't thought of that.
SPEAKER_01: That might cost more though, because obviously with batteries, we don't need to provide...
SPEAKER_01: Or we provide the first batteries, but...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's more...
SPEAKER_01: It does cheaper.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, if you think about these base stations though, it's essentially just a lead with a...
SPEAKER_03: Self-connecting brake.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_03: Right, I don't think I'd be able to...
SPEAKER_02: I'll price that one.
SPEAKER_02: The user interface, the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons.
SPEAKER_02: But since we're a cutting-edge company, we of course will have alternatives.
SPEAKER_02: Like speech recognition, whistling recognition, then rocket power.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And lastly, the transmission interface is just some engineering thing.
SPEAKER_02: You don't have to worry about that.
SPEAKER_02: So here's a great schematic that my apprentice designer gave me.
SPEAKER_02: As you can see, the remote control have parts and those parts, like that.
SPEAKER_02: And, you know, it's got a...
SPEAKER_02: Well, operating procedure.
SPEAKER_02: It looks something like that.
SPEAKER_02: And I suppose you all know how it works, because we've all used it.
SPEAKER_02: And we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were.
SPEAKER_02: Personal preferences, I think, programmable options, which just require a small amount of memory, non-volatile memory, just...
SPEAKER_02: So the user can put in their favorite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings that would turn it on.
SPEAKER_02: It's not blasting.
SPEAKER_01: That's a good idea, actually.
SPEAKER_01: I like the performance of the options.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you do.
SPEAKER_02: And the bells and whistles that we mentioned, you know, take more budgeting, more technical expenditure of effort.
SPEAKER_02: And it's also much more likely to not work if we add these bells and whistles.
SPEAKER_03: So I got...
SPEAKER_03: Okay, thank you so much.
SPEAKER_03: I'll take that back.
SPEAKER_03: Right, also, so, you know what I said, got not very long before we think so.
SPEAKER_03: Didn't manage to forward it onto you, is...
SPEAKER_03: I'm just going to say I'll find it for some...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I think it needs to go in there.
SPEAKER_02: Just...
SPEAKER_03: We had that to disinclute telltext because it's become outdated, nobody uses it in any way.
SPEAKER_03: Oracle would have to say with that, but no, but...
SPEAKER_03: It's only for the television, which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And instead of colors and...
SPEAKER_03: sort of color options, they want corporate color and slogan somehow implemented a new design.
SPEAKER_01: Corporate color.
SPEAKER_03: Yellow.
SPEAKER_03: I presume.
SPEAKER_03: Everything, all this sort of, you know, the corporate website and everything's yellow.
SPEAKER_03: And the local...
SPEAKER_03: So it's Logan, we put the fashion and electronics.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know exactly how to incorporate...
SPEAKER_03: I mean, I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape, you could kind of have it working as way around it or something.
SPEAKER_03: Where are my...
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have.
SPEAKER_03: Now, we had, as listed options, we had speech recognition, potentially, flat screen interface, LCD interface.
SPEAKER_03: We also want to limit their number of buttons.
SPEAKER_03: So we'll pretty much take that one as red.
SPEAKER_03: We'll use the basic functions for our television.
SPEAKER_03: No teletext.
SPEAKER_01: Although the danger with that is it could look a bit cheap.
SPEAKER_03: Not enough buttons, you mean the hair.
SPEAKER_03: Well...
SPEAKER_03: So it's a striker balance between a few and a...
SPEAKER_03: Or it looks like we're just cutting on the...
SPEAKER_01: On number of buttons, can I...
SPEAKER_03: I do, however, have this from over my head.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: They don't want teletext on it.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, cool.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe, Raj, you could find out what people would think about that on the little thing.
SPEAKER_03: About the...
SPEAKER_03: What people...
SPEAKER_03: Other people would require teletext.
SPEAKER_03: In the teletext option, in the remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Attached.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So I take it your position now, always, that...
SPEAKER_03: The bells and whistles we've got to come up with a gimmick, but not too complicated to gimmick it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_03: I mean, the sort of inkling I'm getting from a little bit of web chanel I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a TFT display, interactive display.
SPEAKER_03: However, that does say in a bit like the...
SPEAKER_03: More complicated design that Raj...
SPEAKER_03: Sorry, Raj.
SPEAKER_03: I said people didn't like it.
SPEAKER_03: Although, I guess, if there's a sort of thing about standard interfaces that people use already, sort of windows style, drop down menus, or whatever, I think maybe that's a bit...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Going a bit far, but, you know, like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons, and if you hit that sort of menu at the top, you have...
SPEAKER_03: It goes to a different selection of buttons, so it keeps it simple.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Going the dark, is that sort of with a light inside it, or is it...
SPEAKER_03: Going the dark material.
SPEAKER_01: Going the dark material, and I was thinking.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: I guess that would be cheap kind of.
SPEAKER_00: I'll be able to see something about this.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's really, really very important point, is if we look at the market, because people, 50% people, they find that the mode controls are often lost somewhere in the room.
SPEAKER_00: In the room.
SPEAKER_00: But from last.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, are lost.
SPEAKER_00: And means they forget where they have kept the mode control last time.
SPEAKER_00: But if we add speech recognition, as well as glowing the dark, and both these factors will help them locating their mode control.
SPEAKER_00: Like, if they come and speak something, and the mode control replies to something, something, and it glows in the dark.
SPEAKER_00: Both these factors, both these points will help them to locate where they have kept this remote control.
SPEAKER_00: And this will definitely enhance our market sales.
SPEAKER_00: So we should take it into consideration also.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_03: Speech recognition.
SPEAKER_03: Take it.
SPEAKER_03: I don't have no products.
SPEAKER_03: There was a much...
SPEAKER_02: There was a much...
SPEAKER_02: Well, that cannot two years ago, they had some basic speech recognition on it.
SPEAKER_02: You could program it with your channels, and then say, you know, the BBC One, and it goes to that channel.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it didn't work very well though, because of this noise and interference problem.
SPEAKER_02: They mentioned, you know, if the television says you are listening to the BBC One.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Or, yeah, an advert for BBC Two or the BBC One will switch the channel for you, kind of.
SPEAKER_02: Right, right.
SPEAKER_02: And so there's a lot of this.
SPEAKER_02: You'd be watching the TV and then all of a sudden it pick up a noise and turn it off, or turn the volume off or something.
SPEAKER_02: But if you can work around that noise problem.
SPEAKER_01: Well, what about this might get a big too expensive actually, but what about something was built into the TV that you can press and it'll send out a little signal.
SPEAKER_01: You know, like the ones that we can't hear.
SPEAKER_01: Or something.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know, you can do that, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That will activate the remote control start to beat.
SPEAKER_03: So like I kind of backwards remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And then I do just, you know, subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise.
SPEAKER_02: Well, you could do then would be you have a remote control by the TV speaker.
SPEAKER_02: Or not remote, I'm sorry, a microphone by the TV speaker and the transmitter there.
SPEAKER_02: It sends back to your mode because you can't expect the television manufacturers to put that feature into the device.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's the only thing.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, then you have like a little separate module by the TV stick.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That comes with our remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: And then the remote control will know what's being produced by the TV.
SPEAKER_03: And then the speaker will be the speaker.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's certainly possible.
SPEAKER_02: And another thing is about this losing your mode and trying to find it again.
SPEAKER_02: If you do have this sort of speech interface to it, you don't even need to find it.
SPEAKER_02: You just say, you know, whatever you want the remote for, you know, to change a channel.
SPEAKER_02: Or to turn the TV on and off.
SPEAKER_02: You just shout your command to it and do it for you.
SPEAKER_02: If it's within, you know, within hearing range.
SPEAKER_02: And I, you know, could be somewhere in the room, you know, if no idea where it is.
SPEAKER_02: And it still does jump.
SPEAKER_02: That could also be built into the TV.
SPEAKER_01: There is might make our network a bit obsolete.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Hopefully we'll do it as a joke or head up the earth.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing.
SPEAKER_03: So I think rather than, and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference and not working very well and things are there.
SPEAKER_03: And the expense of the time.
SPEAKER_03: So I think if we're going to go well, I mean, like to think about the problem with the TFT or the LCD kind of thing is if you're also wanting the kind of.
SPEAKER_03: Organic globbies are feeling to it.
SPEAKER_03: Then you might have trouble incorporating screen.
SPEAKER_03: But I guess not.
SPEAKER_03: I just pretend that's not the problem.
SPEAKER_03: And how are you about the blue and the dark and the old?
SPEAKER_01: Maybe not even all of it because we said colors and fashion were important. So maybe just like a little line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest.
SPEAKER_02: The materials cheap, but it's just the the ground and the dark material needs some light to charge it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: If you're sitting in the dark for too long or if it's done under the coach cushions.
SPEAKER_03: We're using the same mind.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, well, we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, because what I thought maybe we're going to have to we're going to have a logo on as well.
SPEAKER_03: Bright yellow logo in a.
SPEAKER_03: It's looking.
SPEAKER_03: Then, you know, they're going to be fairly bright and colored anyway.
SPEAKER_03: And you can have sort of a trimming as well.
SPEAKER_01: And then you can have a dark and the dark and the dark.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that more than finding it that was more like you know, if you're watching a film in the dark.
SPEAKER_01: You can still see the red.
SPEAKER_03: That was more of a.
SPEAKER_03: If we're going to go with the idea of a feedback.
SPEAKER_03: The more finder then that kind of stuff.
SPEAKER_03: It makes it fairly unnecessary.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so we've got do we want to go with the TFT idea.
SPEAKER_03: Is there a getting.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, I think I think they're sort of find the finder things.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, it's a good pull.
SPEAKER_02: We're right.
SPEAKER_02: I think a consideration to is that these are remote get abused a lot.
SPEAKER_02: You know, you get thrown around.
SPEAKER_02: There's a good chance that the TFT screen would break or get damaged.
SPEAKER_02: They're pretty fragile.
SPEAKER_01: So is that one of our definite requirements that they were.
SPEAKER_03: And no, I mean, we were not was going on rough.
SPEAKER_03: I just sort of.
SPEAKER_03: Marking research, I guess.
SPEAKER_03: And.
SPEAKER_03: So stick with sort of programmability.
SPEAKER_03: For the buttons that we do have.
SPEAKER_03: And.
SPEAKER_03: So that's sort of included in your sub module kind of stuff.
SPEAKER_03: You're finding out by tell text.
SPEAKER_03: If you could find that.
SPEAKER_00: Speed to go.
SPEAKER_03: I think we're going to scratch the speech recognition is a bit of a.
SPEAKER_03: Expensive.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, it's much cheaper than TFT.
SPEAKER_02: It's just a mic.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Some integrated circuits.
SPEAKER_02: It'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Well, that kind of takes back the RF.
SPEAKER_03: The RF remote sort of ideas.
SPEAKER_03: Um.
SPEAKER_03: Five minutes.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Decisions.
SPEAKER_03: Folks.
SPEAKER_03: It's vote.

SPEAKER_03: So we've got with speech recognition.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: The speech recognition limited buttons, organic design.
SPEAKER_03: And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down enough.
SPEAKER_03: I've fallen at my head.
SPEAKER_03: Program ability.
SPEAKER_00: Glow in dark.
SPEAKER_01: If it's not a text message, I think it's good to get it.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And also integrating the member to integrate the logo and the slogan.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So, um, can you put all these reports in the project documents folder?
SPEAKER_03: If not already in there as well.
SPEAKER_03: So it just helps me.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Some where I say here.
SPEAKER_03: And, um, I'll put anything I'm putting anything I do in there anyway.

SPEAKER_03: So.
SPEAKER_02: Did you get my email?
SPEAKER_02: I did.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: What I thought was about the material is, um, maybe not this kind of material, maybe more like, um, this kind of rubbering materials, a bit more bouncy.
SPEAKER_01: Like he said, they get chucked around a lot.
SPEAKER_01: Um, a bit more durable.
SPEAKER_01: And that can also be ergonomic.
SPEAKER_01: And it kind of feels a bit different from all other American trials.
SPEAKER_01: The REPA.
SPEAKER_03: More surf.
SPEAKER_03: Um, flash like the plastic.
SPEAKER_04: Mm hmm.
SPEAKER_04: Wow.
SPEAKER_00: But we have to take care of it.
SPEAKER_00: But we have to take care about children also.
SPEAKER_00: And that means if children catch out of here, if they choose, it shouldn't be too harmful.
SPEAKER_00: So whatever material we use.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, no.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It's funny.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: We have to safety point of view also.
SPEAKER_00: We have to take care.
SPEAKER_01: I think with, with the more organic shape, it won't be as, what is it, how many sharp corners is that?
SPEAKER_01: So that's something good.
SPEAKER_01: Um, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Oh my god, it smells good for children.
SPEAKER_02: We have to fleece out of the box and make the thing, a big red ball, foam ball.
SPEAKER_02: So I think they need some.
SPEAKER_02: There's no buttons at all.
SPEAKER_02: It's always on and just yell at it.
SPEAKER_01: That's a good idea.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Chosen up.
SPEAKER_03: It's going to be a big yellow.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yellow.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: With the color, does it have to be all yellow?
SPEAKER_03: Please God, no.
SPEAKER_03: Um, well, I wouldn't, I mean, the reaction to an all yellow and what control wouldn't be anything other than horror.
SPEAKER_03: So I think just having it.
SPEAKER_00: Small yellow.
SPEAKER_00: It's a red in a logo.
SPEAKER_00: It's small yellow strip or yellow square.
SPEAKER_00: Is it a logo in it?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, I'll see if I can argue with the boss about putting the, what is it?
