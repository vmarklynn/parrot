None: o o o
SPEAKER_03: o
None: Calls come back, don'tAN don't tell anything, I'm All here.
None: You know what I mean inside just In this place retreating without trying to learn how to capture I don't know but inside of that
None: If you're falling mad and those would What do we have to do?
SPEAKER_03: First, I want to say I'm the secretary, so I make the minutes.
SPEAKER_03: You find them in your map, in the group, just minutes from the first meeting.
SPEAKER_03: You'll find the next minutes also there.
SPEAKER_03: Then, I want to hear from you what you've done.
SPEAKER_03: And after that, I have some new products, requirements.
SPEAKER_03: And after that, we have to make decisions what we will do.
SPEAKER_03: And then we're ready.
SPEAKER_03: We have 40 minutes for this meeting.
SPEAKER_03: After that, we'll have lunch.
SPEAKER_03: So first, I want to ask the...
SPEAKER_03:...industrial designer to tell what he did.
SPEAKER_03: That's my task.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: What have I put it?
SPEAKER_02: My documents are not.
SPEAKER_03: Hmm.
SPEAKER_02: I've saved it on my computer, my presentation.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, on your computer or...
SPEAKER_03: But where?
SPEAKER_02: What's the name?
SPEAKER_02: What's the name of it?
SPEAKER_02: It was about the working of the remote control.
SPEAKER_03: It's the technical function or the functional requirements.
SPEAKER_02: Nope.
SPEAKER_02: Let's kick off.
SPEAKER_02: Working design.
SPEAKER_02: Working...
SPEAKER_02: Now, I don't know where it is.
SPEAKER_03: Hmm.
SPEAKER_03: Working design.
SPEAKER_03: It is the product documents.
SPEAKER_02: And I'm part of this until...
SPEAKER_03:...in desktop.
SPEAKER_03: Up.
SPEAKER_03: One, up.
SPEAKER_03: Up.
SPEAKER_03: My documents.
SPEAKER_03: What the fuck is this?
SPEAKER_02: Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Oh boy.
SPEAKER_03: Working design.
SPEAKER_02: That's the empty one.
SPEAKER_02: And I had one.
SPEAKER_02: I had one.
SPEAKER_02: I had one.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Here it is.
SPEAKER_03: Not a ticket.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
None: A little later, but here it is.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: It's a little difficult.
SPEAKER_02: What I'm going to tell you.
SPEAKER_02: It's about the working of the remote control.
SPEAKER_02: I just had half an hour to study it.
SPEAKER_02: I don't get it.
SPEAKER_02: Ten minutes to tell it.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I think it will be a few minutes.
SPEAKER_02: First, I will tell you something about the findings.
SPEAKER_02: What I discovered about the remote control.
SPEAKER_02: The working of it.
SPEAKER_02: Then I'll have some kind of map.
SPEAKER_02: So, I'll talk about the remote control.
SPEAKER_02: With a little bit of science.
SPEAKER_02: I'll show it in a few minutes.
SPEAKER_02: And then what I'll think about it.
SPEAKER_02: First, the findings.
SPEAKER_02: The remote control is a very difficult thing to explain.
SPEAKER_02: To just all of you who haven't seen a remote control inside.
SPEAKER_02: I've seen it because it's not so expensive.
SPEAKER_02: And there are a lot of wires.
SPEAKER_02: Which connect the components in it, the battery, and switches and things like that.
SPEAKER_02: It's a lot of small electronics.
SPEAKER_02: So, it won't be too expensive to build it.
SPEAKER_02: And the 12 euro 50, I think, will make it.
SPEAKER_02: And here I have the top of the remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Here's some kind of chip.
SPEAKER_02: On top of this, there are the numbers.
SPEAKER_02: You have all on your remote control.
SPEAKER_02: And the teletext button.
SPEAKER_02: Here's the battery.
SPEAKER_02: When you push the button, it will be sent to the chip.
SPEAKER_02: And the chip will send it to all kind of sub components.
SPEAKER_02: That's what I said.
SPEAKER_02: It's very difficult.
SPEAKER_02: And after that, it will be sent to the infrared.
SPEAKER_02: And that will send it to your television.
SPEAKER_02: That's a short how it works.
SPEAKER_02: I think I can make it difficult.
SPEAKER_02: We all don't get it.
SPEAKER_02: My preference is it won't be...
SPEAKER_02: We shouldn't make it too big.
SPEAKER_02: Also for the cost.
SPEAKER_02: We should only put one battery on it, along lasting battery.
SPEAKER_02: Also for the cost.
SPEAKER_02: Use only plastic.
SPEAKER_02: Not other materials.
SPEAKER_02: Also because of the cost.
SPEAKER_02: Not too much buttons on it.
SPEAKER_02: We can also make a button with a menu button.
SPEAKER_02: And then that you will see it on a TV.
SPEAKER_02: And on a TV you can switch into the menu.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's easier.
SPEAKER_02: And the bleep signal.
SPEAKER_02: You thought it was.
SPEAKER_02: But we can also use it a bleep like something when the battery is empty.
SPEAKER_02: Then there's a bleep.
SPEAKER_02: You'll have to change it in a week or something.
SPEAKER_02: And also the bleep.
SPEAKER_02: What I told you about when you lost it and you push the button.
SPEAKER_02: And then you will bleep bleep.
SPEAKER_02: And we will find it.
SPEAKER_02: This is just two questions.
SPEAKER_03: The battery.
SPEAKER_03: You say one battery is cheaper.
SPEAKER_03: Why?
SPEAKER_02: If we use only one small pen light, then it will be cheaper than what you are doing.
SPEAKER_03: When you use two, you can use it two times longer.
SPEAKER_02: But then we will have to make the remote control long lasting.
SPEAKER_03: Just the size of the remote control.
SPEAKER_03: And the buttons.
SPEAKER_03: When you use it on the television, you need the television.
SPEAKER_03: Which can use it.
SPEAKER_02: But I think this, our remote controllers for the tele-efficient, we sell in our company.
SPEAKER_02: Or is it also for other televisions?
SPEAKER_03: I think we have to use it also on other televisions.
SPEAKER_02: Then this is an option.
SPEAKER_02: So maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions.
SPEAKER_02: And we make it easier for our televisions.
SPEAKER_02: And on the other televisions, you can also use it.
SPEAKER_03: But then the one choose.
SPEAKER_03: I think that's two different things.
SPEAKER_03: We have to choose one.
SPEAKER_02: It has to work on all televisions.
SPEAKER_02: Then I think the menu button will only work on the newer televisions.
SPEAKER_02: And we will look forward and don't make a remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Which is for all the televisions.
SPEAKER_02: And I just have one more idea.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe it's one of your tasks.
SPEAKER_02: But to have a trendy remote control, we can also make something like Nokia mobile phones to change covers.
SPEAKER_02: So if you have a trendy house with all red yellow and something, then you can put a red cover on it.
SPEAKER_02: And also different things.
SPEAKER_00: We'll just add to the cost.
SPEAKER_02: Then it won't be, we'll have just one cover on the original one.
SPEAKER_02: And then you can buy the covers.
SPEAKER_00: Yes. But you have to be able to change it.
SPEAKER_00: Does it make it more difficult to design?
SPEAKER_02: I think it will be a little more difficult, but not too much.
SPEAKER_02: Just like with Nokia mobile phones.
SPEAKER_03: You have to have a much more Nokia phone, then this one.
SPEAKER_02: We'll have to put five covers on it and see if it works.
SPEAKER_02: If it won't work, then we'll get something else.
SPEAKER_02: And we won't go further with it.
SPEAKER_03: Are there profits bigger than the cost?
SPEAKER_02: A government in China, maybe I guess, so expensive, I think.
SPEAKER_03: But there are also design costs.
SPEAKER_03: I don't think when you have remote control, do you change the coffee?
SPEAKER_02: Maybe I won't.
SPEAKER_02: But maybe I think trendy people or children, when you can paint on it and the children think of it.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, this is my remote control.
SPEAKER_02: I made a picture on it.
SPEAKER_03: I think that two less people will change it for good profit.
SPEAKER_02: Do you think about it?
SPEAKER_01: It's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it will make profit enough.
SPEAKER_01: It's an original idea.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, it is.
SPEAKER_03: I don't think we have to do it.
SPEAKER_02: You're the project manager.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, that's it.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: So now the user interface design.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, that's good.
SPEAKER_02: Come on.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, well, I should give a short talk about the technical function design.
SPEAKER_01: I thought the technical function design was for remote control to have some influence on the TV set.
SPEAKER_01: Both audio and video in a cordless way, no cords attached.
SPEAKER_01: And well, it all by pushing a button on the remote.
SPEAKER_01: That was from my own experience and the previous meeting.
SPEAKER_01: I find some interesting quotes on the web.
SPEAKER_01: Well, the same idea here.
SPEAKER_01: Message to the television.
SPEAKER_01: And well, basic operations like on and off and switching channels.
SPEAKER_01: And maybe a teletext or something like that.
SPEAKER_01: All these are two remotes.
SPEAKER_01: And that's our dilemma, I think.
SPEAKER_01: We just heard from the industrial designer how difficult it is.
SPEAKER_01: Shall we make a basic remote control with just swapping channels and volume and power button and will nothing much more or more functions on the remote.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe more devices you can influence radio or video recorder.
SPEAKER_01: VCR.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, well, that's our dilemma. Any ideas about that?
SPEAKER_03: Basic or multifunctional?
SPEAKER_01: We were good back on that later.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, well, that was just on my mind.
SPEAKER_01: So I didn't know what way we would go.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, well, that was my functional talk.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_00: So I'm going to have a presentation about the market, about what people think.
SPEAKER_00: We did usability lab test with 100 persons.
SPEAKER_00: And we looked at several things among them design.
SPEAKER_00: What for stations they had while using remote controls.
SPEAKER_00: Well, what will be our market?
SPEAKER_00: And we asked them if we had some new features.
SPEAKER_00: If there will be a good idea or not.
SPEAKER_00: Well, our findings are users. They dislike the look and feel of current remote controls.
SPEAKER_00: They especially found them very ugly.
SPEAKER_00: And they also found them hard to learn how to use it.
SPEAKER_00: Well, they also set a lot.
SPEAKER_00: So, sapping should be very easy.
SPEAKER_00: And 50% of the users only use 10% of the buttons.
SPEAKER_00: So a lot of unused bitness.
SPEAKER_00: There is more findings on the bitness.
SPEAKER_00: Which bitness find users very important and which not.
SPEAKER_00: And how much do they use them?
SPEAKER_00: Well, the most used bitness is the channels for action.
SPEAKER_00: And we asked them how well event they think the bitness are.
SPEAKER_00: The power volume and channels elections are very relevant.
SPEAKER_00: Tailatex is less relevant but also important.
SPEAKER_00: Not important. They found the audio.
SPEAKER_00: And it's not the volume bit specific.
SPEAKER_00: The pitch or the left or right.
SPEAKER_00: The screen and the brightness and channel settings.
SPEAKER_00: And they also are not used very often.
SPEAKER_00: Then we have a few graphs about the market.
SPEAKER_00: Here we can see what the market share is of several groups.
SPEAKER_00: As you can see, most users are between 36 and 45.
SPEAKER_00: The younger group between 6 and 25 is not very big.
SPEAKER_00: And to come back on the swapping things.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think the younger will be most interested in it.
SPEAKER_00: But they are not a very big group.
SPEAKER_00: And here we asked them how would you like a new feature?
SPEAKER_00: If you have an LCD on the remote control.
SPEAKER_00: What would you think of it?
SPEAKER_00: Now you can clearly see young users say from a.
SPEAKER_00: They will be very nice.
SPEAKER_00: And all the users think they are a bit scared of change.
SPEAKER_00: I think they won't like it.
SPEAKER_00: And another thing.
SPEAKER_00: How would you like to have speech recognition on it?
SPEAKER_00: Well, you see the same young users.
SPEAKER_00: I think that's an interesting idea.
SPEAKER_00: And old users not.
SPEAKER_00: Well, we found out that I are two several markers at which we can aim.
SPEAKER_00: The first are the younger.
SPEAKER_00: The age between 16 and 45.
SPEAKER_00: They are highly interested in the features.
SPEAKER_00: As you can see here.
SPEAKER_00: And they are more critical on their money spending.
SPEAKER_00: The second group is the older group.
SPEAKER_00: The age between 46 and 65.
SPEAKER_00: They are less interested in new features.
SPEAKER_00: But they spend their money more easily.
SPEAKER_00: Now, if you look back at this graph.
SPEAKER_00: You can see that among the first group is about 60%.
SPEAKER_00: And the second group about 40%.
SPEAKER_00: So the first group is bigger.
SPEAKER_00: Well, then I come to my personal preferences.
SPEAKER_00: The first question is also we have to ask.
SPEAKER_00: Is at which mark do we aim at?
SPEAKER_00: Of course, saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that all people won't buy it.
SPEAKER_00: But less of them will buy it.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I...
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: But I fact, even young people say it's hard to use remote control.
SPEAKER_00: So if you make a remote control, that is very easy to use.
SPEAKER_00: That's especially aimed at this group.
SPEAKER_00: Even the young group will also be more interested.
SPEAKER_00: And we can make special features.
SPEAKER_00: But I think it looks nice in the first time.
SPEAKER_00: But when you use it, I don't know what's the good thing of speech recognition.
SPEAKER_00: Well, that's my second point.
SPEAKER_00: Less important functions should be discarded from the remote control.
SPEAKER_00: It's about the kitchen we had earlier.
SPEAKER_00: You can find most functions on a TV set.
SPEAKER_00: So you don't have to have a lot of audio options or screen options to change the brightness.
SPEAKER_00: That's these things.
SPEAKER_00: Well, the design is very important.
SPEAKER_00: One thing I didn't say I think is that a lot of users also said that I will buy a good lurking remote control if there will be one.
SPEAKER_00: But they found most remote controls very ugly.
SPEAKER_00: So the design of our remote control is very important.
SPEAKER_00: And it should be very self-friendly as most users use it for that.
SPEAKER_00: That way are my findings.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I have one question.
SPEAKER_02: If we aim for the younger people, and there will be a lot of features like LCD or the speech recognizing, the cost will be a lot higher.
SPEAKER_02: I think we don't have that in our budget.
SPEAKER_02: Do you think?
SPEAKER_01: I don't think 25 euros for a remote is really cheap or something.
SPEAKER_01: So it's hard to get the younger.
SPEAKER_03: I think LCD is cheaper than speech recognition.
SPEAKER_03: I think that can be a good option.
SPEAKER_03: LCD.
SPEAKER_01: Just LCD.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
None: Only the LCD.
SPEAKER_03: So.
SPEAKER_03: But we'll come back on that.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Now.
SPEAKER_03: Go.
SPEAKER_03: What?
SPEAKER_03: We'll go back on the decisions later.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: We have a few new product requirements.
SPEAKER_03: First, teletext.
SPEAKER_03: We have internet now, so we don't need the teletext anymore.
SPEAKER_03: So.
SPEAKER_03: Not necessary.
SPEAKER_03: Next.
SPEAKER_03: Only for the television.
SPEAKER_03: So we don't look at other things like the radio or something.
SPEAKER_03: Only the television.
SPEAKER_03: Third.
SPEAKER_03: We look at the age group of 40 plus.
SPEAKER_03: Now, younger than 40.
SPEAKER_03: Big group and like you showed.
SPEAKER_03: Not very much people by our stuff.
SPEAKER_03: Fort point.
SPEAKER_03: Our corporate color and slogan must be used.
SPEAKER_03: Very important for the design.
SPEAKER_03: So you can see it on our side.
SPEAKER_03: Next.
SPEAKER_03: We have to make our decisions what we want to do.
SPEAKER_03: So.
SPEAKER_03: Like you said, we need the.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe it's good to put it in a document.
SPEAKER_03: We have to decide what controls do we need.
SPEAKER_03: So.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe you can tell us.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe we can first have a discussion on the.
SPEAKER_00: To provide requirements you just said.
SPEAKER_00: Sorry.
SPEAKER_00: The requirements you just said.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe you first have a discussion about that.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: That person think tell the text is a good option.
SPEAKER_00: Not everyone who's lucky to be can go to internet when they want to see the latest news.
SPEAKER_03: But we don't do it.
SPEAKER_03: You recrymines.
SPEAKER_03: So.
SPEAKER_03: Not my recrymines.
SPEAKER_02: Well, just have to do that.
SPEAKER_02: We have to do this.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Unfortunately.
SPEAKER_03: So.
SPEAKER_03: What controls do we need?
SPEAKER_01: Well, power button.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Power.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I think separate channels.
SPEAKER_03: Channel.
SPEAKER_01: But then both the separate channels.
SPEAKER_01: So.
SPEAKER_01: Zero to nine or something.
SPEAKER_01: Nine.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe it's easy to.
SPEAKER_03: What was your one?
SPEAKER_03: Techno line.
SPEAKER_00: So the functional requirements.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: We have.
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_03: Well, is that example of the L-min?
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: That was the.
SPEAKER_03: The.
SPEAKER_03: The.
SPEAKER_03: The.
SPEAKER_03: The.
SPEAKER_03: Hello.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: What do we need?
SPEAKER_03: On off.
SPEAKER_03: Zero to nine.
SPEAKER_02: To change to the next channel.
SPEAKER_02: Just one button.
SPEAKER_02: To move up, move down.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's the.
SPEAKER_00: Channel.
SPEAKER_00: Do we make a menu?
SPEAKER_03: Menu.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: New.
SPEAKER_03: New.
SPEAKER_03: Teleficient.
SPEAKER_03: Do have menus.
SPEAKER_03: Menu.
SPEAKER_03: I think.
SPEAKER_03: The.
SPEAKER_03: Only one or two.
SPEAKER_03: Nomash.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: And.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That's.
SPEAKER_00: I think it will be quite easy to use with.
SPEAKER_00: For arrows.
SPEAKER_00: Up down for channel selection.
SPEAKER_00: Left.
SPEAKER_00: Right.
SPEAKER_00: For volume.
SPEAKER_00: And.
SPEAKER_00: A menu.
SPEAKER_00: A button.
SPEAKER_00: And if you press the menu button, you get into the menu.
SPEAKER_00: And you can use the same buttons.
SPEAKER_00: You can use them to tend to scroll to the menu and change the options.
SPEAKER_03: On the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_00: You mean.
SPEAKER_00: Well, yeah, that depends on if you have the menu on the TV.
SPEAKER_00: Or you get the menu on the LCD screen on the remote control.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's better to have it on the remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Because it has to work on all televisions.
SPEAKER_03: So.
None: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: And we're coming to the cast.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: But if we.
SPEAKER_00: But well, if we aim at the younger market.
SPEAKER_00: As they as we seen in the usability lab.
SPEAKER_00: They will buy a nice looking.
SPEAKER_00: Remote control.
SPEAKER_00: And also to find the easy to use.
SPEAKER_00: Part very important.
SPEAKER_00: So if you have LCD screen and not too many buttons.
SPEAKER_00: I think that will increase.
SPEAKER_00: Even when it's a bit more cost, it will still sell.
SPEAKER_03: So.
SPEAKER_03: Now we don't have a lot of buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Is this enough?
SPEAKER_03: Mute.
SPEAKER_03: Mute.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe in the menu.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but then it's always more than one.
SPEAKER_01: Mute thing to do.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe more.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: Well.
SPEAKER_03: Then that's all.
SPEAKER_03: This will be the buttons.
SPEAKER_03: And.
SPEAKER_03: I think that's enough for the next phase.
SPEAKER_03: So.
SPEAKER_03: You can go on to.
SPEAKER_02: But now we have only the buttons.
SPEAKER_02: And we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like.
SPEAKER_03: No, that's for the next phase.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: If it's a check.
SPEAKER_03: Phase two is to conceptual design.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Then we will have to concepts.
SPEAKER_03: That's for the next point.
SPEAKER_03: Now we've launched break.
SPEAKER_03: After that, we have 30 minutes for work.
SPEAKER_03: And you can find the minutes in the project document for the inclusive.
SPEAKER_03: The buttons.
SPEAKER_03: You're in the video action.
SPEAKER_03: You can find them in the email.
SPEAKER_03: So not harmful.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Good.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you.
None: So.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Yeah.
None: Okay.
None: You have another.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: You should.
None: You can start at the computer.
None: Shoot.
None: Shoot.
None: Shoot.
