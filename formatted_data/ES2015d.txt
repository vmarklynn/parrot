SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: There you go.
None: Sorry?
SPEAKER_02: Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Why do we have two different microsoft?
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: What would the difference be?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the difference would be...
SPEAKER_01: I'm tapping.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, I can't see where your screen is.
SPEAKER_01: Alright.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, here you go.
SPEAKER_01: Alright.
SPEAKER_01: The agenda for this...
SPEAKER_01: Oh.
SPEAKER_01: Alright.
SPEAKER_01: The agenda for this meeting is who initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers.
SPEAKER_01: And then we will evaluate it, given the criteria that we gave it.
SPEAKER_01: And talk about our finances, whether we were under or over our budget.
SPEAKER_01: I have a spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of what we've made, given our options, and evaluate the product as a group.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And so first we'll have the prototype presentation.
SPEAKER_01: Do you need the PowerPoint?
SPEAKER_00: I just got a piece like.
SPEAKER_00: Alright.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: That's nice.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, here we are.
SPEAKER_02: This is what we came up with.
SPEAKER_02: It's a pretty simple design, it's based on a mine-goal.
SPEAKER_01: Mine-goal.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And we have the company logo here.
SPEAKER_02: And this will be the...
SPEAKER_02:...imperage.
SPEAKER_02: The air.
SPEAKER_02: And this will be the PowerPoint.
SPEAKER_02: The...
SPEAKER_01: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So what was it?
SPEAKER_02: Where's the LED?
SPEAKER_02: It's in the middle of the middle of the little arch.
SPEAKER_02: So I want this to be higher.
SPEAKER_02: And we just have a sample design we wanted it all to be...
SPEAKER_02:...pum hell.
SPEAKER_02:...pum hell.
SPEAKER_02:...yes, pum hell.
SPEAKER_02: And all the...
SPEAKER_02:...potenters are accepted.
SPEAKER_02: And we've done...
SPEAKER_01: Mostly have a number 10 button.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, that was a mistake, isn't it?
SPEAKER_02: Right, it will be cool.
SPEAKER_00:...no, it will be cool.
SPEAKER_02: Tell me, can I want to ask you something?
SPEAKER_02: Sorry.
SPEAKER_02: I was in charge of the number.
SPEAKER_02: And this is just...
SPEAKER_02:...and we've got like a lab in the class.
SPEAKER_00: The plus?
SPEAKER_00: So one plus one.
SPEAKER_02: You have an O.
SPEAKER_02: Press a plus button.
SPEAKER_02: I need to do a one plus.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_01: I've never heard of that kind before.
SPEAKER_02: Well, we just thought we have all the numbers here.
SPEAKER_02: So we wanted something...
SPEAKER_02:...representative with numbers larger than 10.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Because if you...
SPEAKER_00:...on your average...
SPEAKER_00:...remote, if you press one twice, you just go to...
SPEAKER_00:...or say, you wanted channel 12, you press one...
SPEAKER_00:...and you go channel one, and then two, then you just go to channel two instead of 12.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, just not...
SPEAKER_00: So if you just like one plus two, you could go to...
SPEAKER_00:...1012 or two plus two.
SPEAKER_00: But you do this channel 10.
SPEAKER_01: Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two?
SPEAKER_02: No, no.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, that's where you have all these numbers, these numbers.
SPEAKER_02: These numbers all work independently, up to nine.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but I mean, if you press it, it'll go to that channel, right away.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Because you've got to press the plus afterwards.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, no.
SPEAKER_02: The plus doesn't occur.
SPEAKER_02: I've just gone past number nine.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I know.
SPEAKER_01: But if I want to go to say number, like 65, channel 65, but I press the six, it'll go to channel six.
SPEAKER_01: Oh.
SPEAKER_01: And then I'll press the plus, and then we'll go to 65, and then put the five, and we'll go to 65.
SPEAKER_02: Then you press the plus first.
SPEAKER_02: Oh.
SPEAKER_02: It doesn't...
SPEAKER_02: We haven't pressed.
SPEAKER_02: I wouldn't have thought you pressed the plus, but it's a number six, but she's very close.
SPEAKER_02: She has to do it.
SPEAKER_00: What do you say to define that?
SPEAKER_00: I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Like, on the way to channel six.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it wouldn't be a problem.
SPEAKER_01: But I was just wondering, like, as long as we realize that's what it'll do.
SPEAKER_03: There's a delay on remotes, I think, where you can have it.
SPEAKER_03: It's like a five-second input time.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, as long as we hit them, that...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that...
SPEAKER_03: It should be fine.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: As long as there's not a big pause between the two buttons.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, on the top there is volume and channel.
SPEAKER_00: And channel.
SPEAKER_00: Which is so...
SPEAKER_00: Okay, cool.
SPEAKER_00: You can just see and feel like that without thinking about it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Where's the power button?
SPEAKER_00: It's in the network.
SPEAKER_00: It's in the network.
SPEAKER_00: It's in the network.
SPEAKER_00: It's in the network.
SPEAKER_00: Oh.
SPEAKER_00: Oh.
SPEAKER_02: Like it's fast but with...
SPEAKER_02: Taking your hand off the remote.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And we went for, like, a circular design for the numbers, because we thought that was kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: A economic zero-considering.
SPEAKER_00: A economic...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It might actually help with repetitive stress, injury.
SPEAKER_00: It could cause another type of repetition.
SPEAKER_00: But yeah, no, I mean it's a different movement.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And the feel of it, I mean we've made this out of Plato, which is representing the, you know, the world.
SPEAKER_00: The spongy, the revenant.
SPEAKER_00: Because it was said before in the materials specification that this anti-RSI materials often use in stressful.
SPEAKER_00: So this has got a bit of give to it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the stress bar feel.
SPEAKER_00: Do you like feel it yourself?
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: How fit my work.
SPEAKER_01: How of your hand?
SPEAKER_01: My goodness.
SPEAKER_01: There you go.
SPEAKER_01: Hey, did you?
SPEAKER_01: Did you?
SPEAKER_03: Did you?
SPEAKER_03: Oh, it's nice.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, I think I killed the five.
SPEAKER_03: I did.
SPEAKER_00: I did four.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, god.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, as for the colours, we were presented with a limited range.
SPEAKER_00: Of colours for this prototype.
SPEAKER_00: But we're thinking that, seeing as we're having an interchangeable casing, we're thinking of the way that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use or the combination.
SPEAKER_00: And we're thinking to carry on with the fruit and vegetable theme, the colour combination just to be named after different fruit.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, no.
SPEAKER_00: We're black and yellow, water, and green.
SPEAKER_00: You know, the vanilla might be the most popular bit just the lens.
SPEAKER_00: More subtle cream, the other colour.
SPEAKER_00: It looks more like a bit garish.
SPEAKER_01: I do like vanilla and banana wood.
SPEAKER_00: But Anna is more representative of our colour scheme, like the company, the yellow and the black.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_00: So for corporate identity, that would probably be the most abstract.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, watermelon, you know, probably appealing to the business.
SPEAKER_00: Kind of Christmas, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Seasonal.
SPEAKER_00: Apple, green, brown, more kind of trendy, you know.
SPEAKER_02: The paragonal kind of girly and funky kind of.
SPEAKER_02: Cool.
SPEAKER_02: And the most sophisticated costume.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That's the most old decor.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we saw the components.
SPEAKER_00: It was definitely a focus of ergonomics.
SPEAKER_00: And just a single handheld device.
SPEAKER_00: And you don't need to use both hands.
SPEAKER_00: One hand to hold this and type in with the other.
SPEAKER_00: You can just use your thumb.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: As you said, the rubber is probably used for a couple of better anti-RSI.
SPEAKER_01: That's about it.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_01: Good work, everyone.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: And so now that we have a prototype, we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches what our budget can handle.
SPEAKER_01: So I have something I'm going to.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, what do you need to do at presentation first?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know what order it goes up.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to check that out for a second.
SPEAKER_01: Which I didn't.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Sorry.
SPEAKER_01: You're right.
SPEAKER_01: The evaluation criteria is this.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Come on, my computer.
SPEAKER_03: Sorry, my computer is going to be technical difficulties.
SPEAKER_03: Just press out and press the grade again.
SPEAKER_03: Also, I did that.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: All right.
SPEAKER_01: And then again, I think.
SPEAKER_01: One more time.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, still not there.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Now, I think for this one, I could do as before, use the whiteboard or maybe I'll just do it on right on the screen, where you can see it.
SPEAKER_03: We're going to be doing an evaluation report together based on the prototype that we've just seen.
SPEAKER_03: And looking back at my notes from our, with our conceptual and our functional meetings, I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were back to our kickoff meeting this morning.
SPEAKER_03: And we'll evaluate as to whether we've done what we set up to do.
SPEAKER_03: And we're going to do it on a one to seven scale, where one is true and seven is false.
SPEAKER_03: So basically the lower the points, the better.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So question number one.
SPEAKER_03: Does the remote, whoops.
SPEAKER_03: Sorry.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, I'm not going to be able to, I'll do it on the whiteboard.
SPEAKER_03: I can't change it.
SPEAKER_03: So I'm going to ask you to push it down once.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I'll write down our scores up on the.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Number one, do we have a fancy look and feel?
SPEAKER_00: Feel, I think.
SPEAKER_00: I think quite successful with the, yeah, rubber coating.
SPEAKER_01: The look is a little bit more playful.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it depends on your definition of fancy, but it's definitely different.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, definitely.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think the color has a lot to do with it.
SPEAKER_00: The colors we were given for making the photos like aren't the colors that I think we would have necessarily chosen.
SPEAKER_00: It's not the kind of.
SPEAKER_00: I thought we were given red and black.
SPEAKER_00: Red, black and yellow and orange.
SPEAKER_00: I guess.
SPEAKER_02: I don't want to go for black because most people are to black and grey, so you want to stand
SPEAKER_00: out that way in here. If you can imagine that in maybe a kind of pale metallic finish or something.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I know it's for rubber.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, you can visualize this in nice colors.
SPEAKER_00: I think it would look great.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I kind of like the potato look.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, well, I was wondering if it would make me.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, sorry, the mango.
SPEAKER_03: It's fine.
SPEAKER_03: Fruit or vegetable depends on your mood.
SPEAKER_03: Totally.
SPEAKER_01: So myself would say a one or two.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I would say two.
SPEAKER_02: I would say two.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And one being true.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So I add two.
SPEAKER_00: Two.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Actually, that's what you're confusing.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So question number two was, is it technologically innovative?
SPEAKER_03: So I know we have the kinetic energy, which is very innovative.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And the use of the rubber.
SPEAKER_00: The use of the rubber, the use of the LAD.
SPEAKER_00: The LAD isn't musically innovative.
SPEAKER_00: And we don't have any scroll buttons.
SPEAKER_00: It's all push buttons.
SPEAKER_00: There's no LAD control.
SPEAKER_00: So if you're thinking about the rest of the market.
SPEAKER_00: It's probably halfway in some aspects it is.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I think we have three.
SPEAKER_03: And I think, I mean, it's tough to say because we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this.
SPEAKER_03: Because then I would want to say, we want this to be the purpose.
SPEAKER_03: So I mean, we'll put three, but I think we actually reached our goal.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We didn't want it any more than that.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Question number three, will it be easy to use?
SPEAKER_01: I think so.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I think one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I can't really get confused with that.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, we have to work out the number plus the pluses.
SPEAKER_03: The pluses, but once that's figured out, it's half the tenning on.
SPEAKER_03: Number four, is this a good looking remote?
SPEAKER_03: Remember that 75% of users find most remote controls ugly.
SPEAKER_00: Again, I think the color comes into this.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, color will definitely be effective.
SPEAKER_01: I think that the logo could be smaller.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And maybe an odd to the prominent way.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe like at the bottom.
SPEAKER_02: The management said that it had to be prominent.
SPEAKER_01: Well, it just had to be on there.
SPEAKER_01: I just did not touch it.
SPEAKER_03: It's time it's in three I killed.
SPEAKER_03: I was just wondering if it should be like flatter.
SPEAKER_01: I suppose I've got quite the appeal of it being like a big glob.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But you know what I've just thought of?
SPEAKER_02: Maybe it's the bottom is just sort of flat.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the bottom could be like chopped a bit.
SPEAKER_02: But then around.
SPEAKER_02: That's true.
SPEAKER_02: It would still be comfortable.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe it could be on the bottom.
SPEAKER_03: So you wouldn't like if it's flat here.
SPEAKER_03: So it sits up like that.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, that was the only thing.
SPEAKER_01: I'll follow over all the time.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's less.
SPEAKER_03: If it's weighted maybe.
SPEAKER_03: It's a good looking remote.
SPEAKER_03: We want to show it off to our friends.
SPEAKER_02: You were though.
SPEAKER_02: It's more interesting.
SPEAKER_01: I think it was another color and it was like.
SPEAKER_01: I think it look okay.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe two.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, I would make it that way rather than like your average.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Remind like that.
SPEAKER_00: But definitely another color.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not happy with that.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so should we say two?
SPEAKER_03: For that, sure.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Question number five.
SPEAKER_03: What's?
SPEAKER_03: Will people be willing to spend 25 euros on this product?
SPEAKER_03: Remember that 80% of users were willing to spend more money when remote control looked fancy?
SPEAKER_02: I think we have to market it in the right way.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: To say that is a simple thing.
SPEAKER_02: So people don't just say it and think.
SPEAKER_02: This is so simple to say.
SPEAKER_02: I do want to spend 25 euros.
SPEAKER_02: You have to market.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: The marketing of lots of units.
SPEAKER_03: The kinetic energy.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: The kinetic energy.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Holy.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, no.
SPEAKER_00: Shake it.
SPEAKER_00: It's awful.
SPEAKER_00: Shake it.
SPEAKER_00: It's awful.
SPEAKER_02: Say it in.
SPEAKER_02: There's a B-Five of you.
SPEAKER_03: No, I guess I don't know much about the remote control industry.
SPEAKER_03: How much your average sells for?
SPEAKER_03: But you're a marketing expert.
SPEAKER_03: I know I am.
SPEAKER_02: I think they're quite 10.
SPEAKER_02: 10.
SPEAKER_02: But you don't have to buy batteries.
SPEAKER_03: So in the long term, this can actually save you my household.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So I'll market it that way.
SPEAKER_03: Exactly.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So yeah, I think with a good marketing scheme and the personalization options.
SPEAKER_03: So yeah, I would give it a two.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Number six.
SPEAKER_00: Can someone read it out?
SPEAKER_00: Does this prototype match the operating behavior of the alpha-g?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So that was mainly that.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think it does.
SPEAKER_00: It's artistic.
SPEAKER_00: It's like the most accessible buttons are the volume and the channel changing.
SPEAKER_00: And it's just you don't have to think about it.
SPEAKER_00: You don't have to look down to find them.
SPEAKER_00: Clearly they're easy to use.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I guess the I think the keyword there is average.
SPEAKER_03: Because there were some people that used the video input and sound and stuff.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But they're not you and I really.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Number seven.
SPEAKER_03: How do you push it down?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's going to be easy to find when lost.
SPEAKER_03: Remember that 50% of users lose their own regularly.
SPEAKER_02: We had the alarm system.
SPEAKER_02: Is the alarm system still implemented?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: When you press the alarm system, the light.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Light on the end or flash the ball.
SPEAKER_00: But I mean, it's not obviously obvious from the outside.
SPEAKER_00: That's going to happen.
SPEAKER_02: Because you can't particularly see the light on the inside.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The light.
SPEAKER_02: It will.
SPEAKER_00: But when the alarm's not.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: If you must button makes a noise, right?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It turns into a darkening starts cracking.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Here I am.
SPEAKER_00: Awesome.
SPEAKER_00: I think if it was having an alarm system, I mean, when it lights up, I mean, it could light up when the alarm went.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something, it wouldn't be any point.
SPEAKER_00: So you can't see the alarm.
SPEAKER_00: But it would like to.
SPEAKER_01: I thought it was going to make a noise.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We can't see an alarm inside.
SPEAKER_03: Just the alarm system itself.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: You're just explaining why it's not on the prototype.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So we can say that.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Sorry.
None: We can give it a one because compared to every other remote ever made, this one will be easier to find.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Sorry.
SPEAKER_03: The question number eight.
SPEAKER_03: Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new?
SPEAKER_03: Remember that 34% of users usually found it difficult.
SPEAKER_03: So.
SPEAKER_03: So.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic.
SPEAKER_00: But I think that itself makes it.
SPEAKER_03: It's a make more sense for the middle one to be just an enter button.
SPEAKER_03: So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So it's just like channel six.
SPEAKER_01: That's.
SPEAKER_01: And.
SPEAKER_01: And.
SPEAKER_02: And.
SPEAKER_02: And.
SPEAKER_02: And.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So.
SPEAKER_00: So.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So we can.
SPEAKER_03: We'll say yes.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: One.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Question number nine.
SPEAKER_03: Well, minimize the effects of our SI, which was repeated strain in.
SPEAKER_03: In.
SPEAKER_01: And.
SPEAKER_01: Which affected over a quarter of users.
SPEAKER_01: I think so.
SPEAKER_00: It's like right in the.
SPEAKER_00: But if yours.
SPEAKER_00: You thumb might get a little.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think we may have to do some more research in the other strain injuries that we don't know about.
SPEAKER_01: It is soft.
SPEAKER_01: And that's kind of what the.
SPEAKER_01: And people PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for.
SPEAKER_01: So.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what other options we get.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, you can hold on to your left hand and.
SPEAKER_03: Use your index figure.
SPEAKER_03: But there's not really any other options.
SPEAKER_03: It's like a keyboard.
SPEAKER_03: So.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I think we did as much as you can with the local troll.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So.
SPEAKER_03: One or two, do you think.
SPEAKER_00: I think.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think two.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Number 10.
SPEAKER_03: Did we somehow incorporate the company color and logo?
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: And the color is going to be there even if it's like vanilla is the yellow.
SPEAKER_02: We can't really do that because for example, on the banana, we can't have everything yellow.
SPEAKER_02: It will sound like.
SPEAKER_02: So.
SPEAKER_02: It's not always going to be the same color.
SPEAKER_03: It sounds like the color is something that we.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The colors are yellow and gray.
SPEAKER_01: Gray.
SPEAKER_02: So it could be gray on the banana one.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Could be gray.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, the yellow, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: The yellow is ugly though.
SPEAKER_03: Depending on that.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So we have to talk to our executive managers and see if we can get away with just the art.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think this is the.
SPEAKER_00: The fact that we.
SPEAKER_00: We need success.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Perhaps.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: The buttons in the middle.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So do you think that's more of a three then?
SPEAKER_03: Four.
SPEAKER_03: Four.
SPEAKER_03: I think four.

SPEAKER_03: But we have good reasons for it.
SPEAKER_03: So we can still put a.
SPEAKER_03: Four.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And final question.
SPEAKER_03: Did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics?
SPEAKER_03: Current trends of fruits and veggies desire for sponginess.
SPEAKER_01: I would say so.
SPEAKER_01: But maybe more like two.

SPEAKER_02: I think.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: Maybe if it was sent it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: So based on.
SPEAKER_01: This evaluation.
SPEAKER_01: Do we average the notes?
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: We do.
SPEAKER_03: So what was I going to put for that?
SPEAKER_03: Two for a fashion.
SPEAKER_03: I would say two.

SPEAKER_01: Satisfactory? Is that the computer programs are good? Yeah, it could be really straightforward.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. I think it was the only thing was having to remember to, you know, take the okay,
SPEAKER_02: the thing I was the only one who struggled with that. I'm actually not sure if I could stay with
SPEAKER_03: the English language. Yeah. I'll probably still be there. Yeah.
