None: Hanna, Hanna, Hanna, Hanna, Hanna, Last meeting we have discussed the concept of design and we ask you to prepare a prototype for the multi-controll.
SPEAKER_02: I'd be in.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so let's see what.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so can you go to the shed folder?
SPEAKER_01: The shed folder.
SPEAKER_02: The folder presentation.
SPEAKER_01: We have a presentation because I have a presentation.
SPEAKER_01: The pumpkin.
SPEAKER_01: So I got a participant three, three.
SPEAKER_02: It's a final design.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So I discussed with you.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototype.
SPEAKER_01: Because we were not decided whether we wanted to have an LCD or not.
SPEAKER_01: Because it's too expensive.
SPEAKER_01: So we come out with two versions.
SPEAKER_01: One weave and one with our LCDs.
SPEAKER_01: But both comes with a charger.
SPEAKER_01: And then detachable or unparalleled control module.
SPEAKER_01: And detachable big buttons for all people.
SPEAKER_01: So.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so I'll show you two prototypes.
SPEAKER_03: Here are the first one with the beautiful LCD and display.
SPEAKER_03: And you can just browse into the navigation menu by a joystick-like button.
SPEAKER_03: You can choose the direction.
SPEAKER_03: And if you just push on it, it's considered like an Enter function.
SPEAKER_03: You have on the side here the microphone for the speech recognition system here.
SPEAKER_03: And you switch that control.
SPEAKER_02: Why you put it in the side?
SPEAKER_02: Well, I think it's not a good AS movie to do that.
SPEAKER_01: No, it's all around the microphone.
SPEAKER_01: The microphone picks up the speech from the microphone.
SPEAKER_04: Is it only a single microphone or microphone?
SPEAKER_03: So it's a microphone array.
SPEAKER_02: It's very costly.
SPEAKER_02: It's just a single microphone.
SPEAKER_03: I think we put it here because I think when you are browsing your LCD, you will be close to, well, it's better to place it here, for instance.
SPEAKER_03: And here is a little switch that control if you want the speaker recognition system to be on or off.
SPEAKER_03: And so this remote control comes up with its Charger.
SPEAKER_03: How much does it cost this one?
SPEAKER_03: Well, this prototype is made for about 15 dollars.
SPEAKER_03: 15 dollars.
SPEAKER_03: But it's not a division.
SPEAKER_03: But it's just a prototype.
SPEAKER_03: And if we optimize the...
SPEAKER_04: The cost will be less.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, the production costs.
SPEAKER_03: We can achieve about 10 dollars.
SPEAKER_02: How many?
SPEAKER_03: How many, excuse me, party?
SPEAKER_03: Well, a battery.
SPEAKER_03: We use about...
SPEAKER_01: The two AA batteries, isn't it?
SPEAKER_01: AA rechargeable batteries.
SPEAKER_01: Rechargeable, of course.
SPEAKER_03: Of course, because we have the charger.
SPEAKER_01: We have the charger, so it's no problem.
SPEAKER_02: And you just say, one battery?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, one battery.
SPEAKER_03: Is it two or one?
SPEAKER_04: It's kitty tick.
SPEAKER_02: It's actually...
SPEAKER_01: It's a flexible thing.
SPEAKER_01: No, it's a voltage rating for that.
SPEAKER_04: The voltage rating.
SPEAKER_04: What type of battery?
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah, it's just a simple battery.
SPEAKER_03: Rechargeable.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: If you...
SPEAKER_04: Something like two, a three size battery.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, and if you want to charge the battery, you just put the remote control like that.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Plug in the charger and leave it alone.
SPEAKER_03: It's all right.
SPEAKER_03: Then the next time you pick it, Oh.
SPEAKER_01: It works.
SPEAKER_01: I forgot to tell you, there is only a single button there.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, just explain the button.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, all right.
SPEAKER_01: This button is like a mouse.
SPEAKER_01: You can move in 360 degrees of direction.
SPEAKER_01: So, you can make a turn.
SPEAKER_01: And it...
SPEAKER_01: The functions associated to all the actions you make.
SPEAKER_01: You have a click.
SPEAKER_01: You have a double click.
SPEAKER_01: All in a single button.
SPEAKER_01: You can move up, down, left, right.
SPEAKER_01: Or you can do a swing.
SPEAKER_01: So, a swing to the left or swing to the right.
SPEAKER_01: Defines other functions.
SPEAKER_01: So, even though it's a single button, but it's pretty flexible because of the 360 degree movement.
SPEAKER_04: On the LCD is this one.
SPEAKER_04: On the remote.
SPEAKER_01: This is the version that comes with LCD.
SPEAKER_01: Here present another version,
SPEAKER_02: the body else. I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months of function is button getting destroyed.
SPEAKER_02: Oh.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. This is new prototype.
SPEAKER_03: So, we have the second version also with a different button configuration.
SPEAKER_03: The second version is also simpler.
SPEAKER_03: We just have to put the microphone.
SPEAKER_03: So, basically, it's the same switch.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Basically, it's the same things I've presented before.
SPEAKER_03: But here we have four buttons for navigation.
SPEAKER_03: Plus one button acting as an enter button.
SPEAKER_03: So, according to what you said, it's more robust to the user.
SPEAKER_03: And it's also cheaper to produce.
SPEAKER_03: We can produce a set remote control for about four other hours.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: It's easy.
SPEAKER_04: Good.
SPEAKER_04: And I think you forgot the point here to have a button to find the charger.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, no.
SPEAKER_03: Because there's a measure.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Speed-chognition system.
SPEAKER_04: And if you disable speed-chognition system then...
SPEAKER_01: Well, I will come to that point later.
SPEAKER_03: So, Norman will explain to you.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe we'll set the charger with this.
SPEAKER_01: Of course.
SPEAKER_01: Either the charger, in either versions, they use the same charger.
SPEAKER_02: So, the price of the charger included in the...
SPEAKER_01: It's a standard module.
SPEAKER_01: So, you should get for a cheap price.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: It's the same charger that you can use for the handphone.
SPEAKER_01: But again, it depends on the types.
SPEAKER_01: I think we have to investigate more on that.
SPEAKER_02: The price should be below 12 and 12.
SPEAKER_01: But as the marketing manager says, people are willing to pay more for good design.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, people are willing to pay more.
SPEAKER_04: But the company is not willing to invest more.
SPEAKER_02: The price of selling is 25 euros.
SPEAKER_02: And the price of...
SPEAKER_03: Alright, so, go on Norman with the special features.
SPEAKER_01: Well, come out to that.
SPEAKER_01: The thing that makes the controller cheap is that it is modular.
SPEAKER_01: So, you want more functions, you pay more.
SPEAKER_01: If you want less functions, if you want a reasonable price, you can put it back in or you can use the other one.
SPEAKER_01: Or...
SPEAKER_01: The special connection is the wisdom microphone.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Then the microphone is put in.
SPEAKER_01: Then you have a special connection.
SPEAKER_01: You pay less for the system.
SPEAKER_01: You see.
SPEAKER_01: You see.
SPEAKER_01: You see.
SPEAKER_01: You see.
SPEAKER_01: You see.
SPEAKER_01: You see.
SPEAKER_01: You see.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: It's pretty flexible in the...
SPEAKER_03: You also have the two other modules for the parental control.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: You can head up to your remote control.
SPEAKER_03: If you want to have more power on what you do.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And with channel you want to choose, and so on.
SPEAKER_03: Here is just the module for the kids.
SPEAKER_03: And if the parents want to watch TV, they come up with their modules, they just plug in it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And they can have all the control they want here.
SPEAKER_03: We also have this module for old people.
SPEAKER_03: With big buttons, clearly labeled, and it acts like the previous one.
SPEAKER_03: You just plug in and it works.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The idea, the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful.
SPEAKER_01: Simplicity, meaning that we have few buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Powerful is that all the controls, the one you saw, we saw earlier in the meetings.
SPEAKER_01: With lots of buttons.
SPEAKER_01: But here you only have few buttons, but you retain them.
SPEAKER_01: The same powerful functionalities.
SPEAKER_01: And then you have the same condition with simplicity.
SPEAKER_01: So that's the best idea.
SPEAKER_01: The concept, that's our innovation in this design here.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, now we come to other important features that I did not tell you.
SPEAKER_01: The first one is the speech synchronizer.
SPEAKER_01: Again, it's detachable or add-on.
SPEAKER_01: And then we also have security features.
SPEAKER_01: For example, this year.
SPEAKER_01: It's very robust, but it doesn't break.
SPEAKER_01: The material one was the material.
SPEAKER_01: It's titanium.
SPEAKER_01: It's very...
SPEAKER_01: Again, either battery life is an durable one.
SPEAKER_01: Again, because it's AA batteries, you can choose the types of batteries you want.
SPEAKER_01: You can replace the cheaper one.
SPEAKER_01: Again, you pay for what you get.
SPEAKER_01: And then the other point is robust.
SPEAKER_01: And then you have a replacement reminder.
SPEAKER_01: So when you finish watching your TV and you turn off the TV, and then there's a message coming out that please put that back to the charger.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So that's the reminder part.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And they also use a programmable channel and vocabulary.
SPEAKER_01: So it's up to the user to define.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: Sorry.
SPEAKER_01: And then because of the children that are using the device, we have also a pre-filter of TV programs by John.
SPEAKER_01: And this can be used by the adult or by the children.
SPEAKER_01: So instead of choosing the channel, you are choosing the TV contents of the night.
SPEAKER_01: So it's pretty powerful.
SPEAKER_01: And that's why the not buttons are reduced because of this feature.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And for the materials that is cheap to produce, I think it's quite clear from...
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And also like the wet and the fancy designs.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe you can improve more the design.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe.
SPEAKER_02: What's the price to produce?
SPEAKER_03: Well, so the price to produce.
SPEAKER_03: For the simplest one, we start from four dollars to produce such a device.
SPEAKER_03: It's about...
SPEAKER_02: It's about...
SPEAKER_03: Without the charger.
SPEAKER_03: It's about, well, two dollars to produce the microphone and speech recognition systems.
SPEAKER_03: Two dollars for the...
SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: And finally, three dollars for the charger.
SPEAKER_03: So if you sum up everything, we don't have to...
SPEAKER_03: With the LCD.
SPEAKER_03: Which costs two dollars.
SPEAKER_03: You have two plus four plus four plus two plus two.
SPEAKER_04: I think we use the Excel.
SPEAKER_04: We don't have only...
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So the total cost,
SPEAKER_03: if you want all the functionalities, will be about 15 dollars.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But it's just if you want all functionalities.
SPEAKER_02: It's just if you want all functionalities.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Excuse me?
SPEAKER_04: It's below the pre-pitch.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it's a nice inputs.
SPEAKER_04: But we have an...
SPEAKER_04: Other inputs from the public demands.
SPEAKER_04: I think we would just have a rough look.
SPEAKER_04: And then we can make our statements.
SPEAKER_04: And we can finalize the product based on this.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So we can find out how we could come to some final conclusions.
SPEAKER_04: So the marketing made an evaluation criteria.
None: And this was some of the findings.
None: And in the market, we have a lot of information.
SPEAKER_04: And we have a lot of information.
SPEAKER_04: And we have a lot of information.
SPEAKER_04: And in the market, the people are not really interested with LCD, without LCD, with speech recognition, interface, or without speech recognition, interface.
SPEAKER_04: But most of the people, what they are interested is, first thing is, they want to have a fancy look and feel.
SPEAKER_04: It should be very fancy with colorful technologies.
SPEAKER_04: It should be much more technologically innovative.
SPEAKER_04: Of course, in that, we could put LCD or recognition to be more technologically innovative.
SPEAKER_04: And the third one is easy to use.
SPEAKER_03: And I think that the technical innovation is in the product itself, since we haven't yet remodeled, who are Halloween to choose, and interactively with the TV screen, with just four buttons.
SPEAKER_04: And if you go to the next slide, here you can find, these are the latest version of the Dets.
SPEAKER_04: And so this, and Paris and Milan, they are the detector, these trends, that this year, it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable.
SPEAKER_04: So people are really interested to see if they haven't remodeled in the shape of the fruit or vegetable or whatever they like.
SPEAKER_04: So I think it should be much more customized to make a different shapes.
SPEAKER_04: And the second thing is, and if the material, they really do not want it to be very hard, as in the case of very plastic-caught titanium, it should be somewhat spongy.
SPEAKER_01: But then the problem is that is it robust to mishandling?
SPEAKER_01: We should find a material that is robust, at the same time spongy.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, spongy.
SPEAKER_04: So finally we have these three criterias.
SPEAKER_04: One is fancy look.
SPEAKER_04: Second is, innovative.
SPEAKER_04: And third is, easy to use.
None: So these are the three criteria, on which we are going to build our remod.
SPEAKER_04: And we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these.
SPEAKER_04: Say that, we have a seven point scale, from one to seven.
SPEAKER_04: And for each of the product, you could just give me the scale, according to this.
SPEAKER_04: So in our case, we have a width LCD and without LCD.
SPEAKER_04: So on this scale, if it is true, if it is, if it has a fancy look, you could just tell me one.
SPEAKER_04: Or if it is false, it doesn't look much fancy, then you could just tell me seven.
SPEAKER_04: So we can make our study on this.
SPEAKER_01: So is evaluation depending on Earth, other users?
SPEAKER_04: No, no, we have, you are designed two products now.
SPEAKER_04: One is with LCD and without LCD.
SPEAKER_01: But who will give the scoring a, we ourselves or, you, or the party.
SPEAKER_04: No, according to you, designers, how you feel, does it with LCD and without LCD?
SPEAKER_04: Okay, let us make this L and without LCD.
SPEAKER_04: On this scale, we have a LCD remote control.
SPEAKER_04: How does it look?
SPEAKER_04: Is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy?
SPEAKER_03: Well, it doesn't look much fancy.
SPEAKER_03: I will say three or four.
SPEAKER_04: And you both agree for that?
SPEAKER_01: I think we can improve on the design.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, somewhere, comment that this is like the stone edge of the design.
SPEAKER_01: So we have been focused all this time on the technical aspect, functional aspect.
SPEAKER_01: But also the simplicity.
SPEAKER_01: As for the design, maybe we should hire a designer to do.
SPEAKER_04: So I take three on the LCD.
SPEAKER_04: So without LCD, how would you rate it?
SPEAKER_03: Four.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's more easy to make fancy things when it's not complicated.
SPEAKER_03: So removing the LCD gives us more liberty to
SPEAKER_04: have a fancy look. And in the sense of innovativeness with LCD?
SPEAKER_03: Well, it's the same for both.
SPEAKER_03: So I will give five, six.
SPEAKER_04: Five with LCD and
SPEAKER_03: Well, five also Norman, please.
SPEAKER_01: From the innovation aspect, I feel that what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototype that we saw in the last meeting is that the retrieval of TV programs by content.
SPEAKER_01: Because that is really innovative.
SPEAKER_01: And for now, another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity.
SPEAKER_01: Few buttons with a lot of functionalities.
SPEAKER_01: So without LCD?
SPEAKER_01: For both, I have a thing that our product has the best in all.
SPEAKER_01: Well, this is a bias and judgment.
SPEAKER_04: No, no. According to design aspect, we want to know how do you feel innovativeness?
SPEAKER_01: Innovation is very high.
SPEAKER_04: With LCD.
SPEAKER_03: And without LCD?
SPEAKER_03: For both.
SPEAKER_03: Innovation is the same innovation.
SPEAKER_01: So maybe you can put six.
SPEAKER_03: No, six.
SPEAKER_04: Let's go with four things.
SPEAKER_04: Both.
SPEAKER_04: No, actually to make it with LCD, you make more efforts.
SPEAKER_04: So either is high innovativeness included if you make it with LCD.
SPEAKER_04: Then when it is without LCD, there is not much innovativeness.
SPEAKER_01: So I can't go.
SPEAKER_01: There was an issue here is that what is display on LCD?
SPEAKER_01: We haven't really I mean, that's what you are saying.
SPEAKER_01: Actually, it's good to have an LCD, but what are we going to display on an LCD?
SPEAKER_01: No, it's like this.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, on the LCD,
SPEAKER_04: according to what I understand from your model is, you have a joystick here.
SPEAKER_04: And you have an LCD.
SPEAKER_04: You just press your joystick.
SPEAKER_04: You get here a program.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but then the same program on the TV screen.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Exactly.
SPEAKER_04: No, on the TV, it doesn't display on the TV now.
SPEAKER_04: If you have the LCD.
SPEAKER_04: LCD, then there is no meaning in having on the TV.
SPEAKER_04: Or then again, you have a channels, volume, and all this stuff.
SPEAKER_04: But you can display all on an LCD.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, that depends upon your design.
SPEAKER_04: So.
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, for the users who opt for LCD, we will give them the LCD.
SPEAKER_01: We will give them the LCD.
SPEAKER_01: We give them the customer ones, right?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So without LCD, you want to put it the same level of innovativeness.
SPEAKER_04: And which word do you recommend?
SPEAKER_04: Is it to use with LCD or without LCD?
SPEAKER_03: Well, I think both are really easy to use because there are a few buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Well, the menu are clear, well-organized.
SPEAKER_03: So.
SPEAKER_03: Well, with little knowing of the technology, you can easily use the product.
SPEAKER_03: So I would give a six for the user to use.
SPEAKER_01: I think.
SPEAKER_02: Sorry.
SPEAKER_02: No, it's just if I see the the rate, I think it's better to do it without LCD.
SPEAKER_02: Because as with LCD, just we increase the price.
SPEAKER_02: They have the same rates of without LCD.
SPEAKER_04: Or we can just go back to the previous slide where we have a few updates.
SPEAKER_04: So, I mean, in the product design, you could just amend it to make some future changes according to the fruit on the stable or a spongey touch.
SPEAKER_04: Without LCD and without speech recognition, even then our product is going to be very good.
SPEAKER_03: Very good to produce.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And if we have less technology, we are more liberty to follow the shape and things like that.
SPEAKER_01: I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect.
SPEAKER_01: I think the easy to use aspect is different for different people.
SPEAKER_01: For the young generation, easy to use may be very complicated because there are a lot of controls with lots of buttons.
SPEAKER_01: For kids, they want simplicity, the city is similar for the office, for the office, for the office.
SPEAKER_01: So that's why with the parental module, we can have a bit more complex design if they want it.
SPEAKER_01: But what I'm trying to say here is that we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of buttons.
SPEAKER_01: So in terms of easy to use, I think it's very user customizable.
SPEAKER_01: User customization is very important.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So without LCD,
SPEAKER_04: I just take it 5 or you want the 26. I think it's the same.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, as you say, we'd better...
SPEAKER_03: We'd better...
SPEAKER_04: I think it's better to have this without LCD.
SPEAKER_03: And to improve the...
SPEAKER_04: As our project manager says that without LCD, it is going to reduce the cost also, and it's going to be much simpler to use.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, simply to use Morne Berthi to have a fancy look.
SPEAKER_03: So let's go back to our laboratory.
SPEAKER_02: So what do you prefer to buy this special permission?
SPEAKER_02: Huh?
SPEAKER_02: And you want to buy the integration of...
SPEAKER_01: The special permission is an on-module.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, that's going to be an optional.
SPEAKER_04: If someone wants to buy it, they can have it otherwise.
SPEAKER_03: It's an optional option.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Since, well, according to this study, people are more...
SPEAKER_02: I think it's more the first ponji here.
SPEAKER_02: I'm more controlled.
SPEAKER_02: It would be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Because maybe parents...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, if you have an add-ons,
SPEAKER_04: the kids may just hide the parental module and so that the parents can't do it.
SPEAKER_02: Parents take care of the kids, forget where they put it on.
SPEAKER_02: So maybe better if you have all these in the same...
SPEAKER_02: In the same set.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And individual buttons to make them work.
SPEAKER_01: The problem is if a customer wants a certain component and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children.
SPEAKER_01: When you sell the product in the market, you could meet any kind of people.
SPEAKER_01: And not all people will need all the functionalities you propose to them.
SPEAKER_01: So we might lose the customer because of this.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know, what do you think?
SPEAKER_02: So you mean that even if this module is supposed to be...
SPEAKER_02: It would be functional?
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: But what do you think? I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: I have to make a marketing survey that how many married couples or how many couples have a TV or to the number of singles who have a television.
SPEAKER_04: So based on that, I think...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But the question is, does those modularity increase the production cause or decrease the production cause?
SPEAKER_01: Well, it's about the same.
SPEAKER_01: Because if...
SPEAKER_03: Well, you can...
SPEAKER_03: If you add something like...
SPEAKER_03: Oh, no.
SPEAKER_03: Because if you add something like...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, maybe because it's three different pieces to build a bit.
SPEAKER_04: But you can make it on a single piece with three different options.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's cheaper if you...
SPEAKER_03: You already built the old functionalities on the same module.
SPEAKER_03: But on the same piece of it.
SPEAKER_01: Well, the other aspect is that when they have the existing product, you're going to maintain the...
SPEAKER_01: You're going to keep the same customer because the same customer will come back
SPEAKER_04: to buy other add-ons. Yeah, that's right.
SPEAKER_01: How many could you just provide with an optional service?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, if so, if you don't buy it now, it's a future.
SPEAKER_01: So, in that way, you're actually keeping the same customer attracting them to come back and again and again.
SPEAKER_04: So, it's something like a Microsoft product.
SPEAKER_04: I'm trying to follow the Microsoft.
SPEAKER_02: We don't want that.
SPEAKER_01: And we don't want to...
SPEAKER_04: Updates and we sell it.
SPEAKER_04: We make updates and sell it on this.
SPEAKER_01: Well, if the buyers can be upgraded, it can be a good thing.
SPEAKER_01: They had to depends on the production.
SPEAKER_04: And that was the idea about the shape of the remote controls.
None: Well, so...
SPEAKER_04: And they've been made into a fruit and vegetable types.
SPEAKER_03: They require different types of PCBs.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but, well, the components, we'll have to change because we have to deal with the shape.
SPEAKER_03: But I don't think it will increase the cost much.
SPEAKER_04: Or it could be like this.
SPEAKER_04: The PCB would be the same for all, but only the exterior shape is different for all.
SPEAKER_03: Well, but it's a bit complicated to...
SPEAKER_03: If you need machines to...
SPEAKER_03: different machines to...
SPEAKER_01: Well, well...
SPEAKER_01: Well, we can change this to propose the customers with skins.
SPEAKER_01: For example, the mobile phones nowadays...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: They sell different kinds of skins.
SPEAKER_01: And then people just feel that,
SPEAKER_03: oh, I have a new skin and it looks better. And then it's a double shape.
SPEAKER_03: And then...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know the skins.
SPEAKER_01: And with this spongy texture, things like that.
SPEAKER_04: You can fly in one material that being...
SPEAKER_01: Sponging.
None: Sponging.
SPEAKER_01: You need to look into the material.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, a flurry,
SPEAKER_03: like a pet dog kind of thing. Yeah.
