None: One minute.
SPEAKER_03: Like a minute, so I'll do whatever you want.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah, that's I call that one.
SPEAKER_04: I thought maybe you could display it on the screen, but it's not necessary.
SPEAKER_02: No, this is just about there.
SPEAKER_02: I have some shokk over here.
None: It tastes funny.
None: What if you don't?
SPEAKER_02: It's like mixed chocolate milk and coffee or something.
None: Oh, that's nasty.
None: Pictures.
None: Next after each other in the last place.
None: Yeah, that would be easier with opening.
SPEAKER_04: Did you put it in the chat hole?
None: Yeah, let's see.
None: Oh, we can begin.
None: Move to the meeting room and bring your laptop.
None: Thank you.
None: That's a date too.
SPEAKER_02: Welcome to the.
None: Sorry.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, maybe good for a presentation if I just.
None: Not sure this yet.
None: No, I see.
None: Okay, but welcome to the fourth meeting, the detailed design meeting, or we have to re-position on the details after remote control presented by your one-amountly project manager.
SPEAKER_03: What we going to do once again, I'm going to take minutes.
SPEAKER_03: So no presentation for me.
SPEAKER_03: First, we have a prototype presentation by G and G.
SPEAKER_03: You have to work some.
SPEAKER_03: Evaluation.
SPEAKER_01: Evaluation.
SPEAKER_03: Sorry.
SPEAKER_03: Evaluation criteria.
SPEAKER_03: In combination with finance, I.
SPEAKER_03: I received an Excel file.
SPEAKER_03: Which we have to fill in later on.
SPEAKER_03: You see.
SPEAKER_03: And then we must see if we stay under the 12 and a half euro.
SPEAKER_03: So that's.
SPEAKER_00: That's a big problem.
SPEAKER_03: So let's wait.
SPEAKER_03: We have we have we must have some time for that.
SPEAKER_03: Because it will be quite a lot of mathematics.
SPEAKER_03: And after that, uh, uh, uh, evaluation of the process, how we, uh, how we have done it here with the smart work with, uh, with our laptops, with, uh, all, all this.
SPEAKER_03: And, uh, afterwards, uh, we're closing.
SPEAKER_03: Once again, 40 minutes.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, uh, let's start.
SPEAKER_03: I will give the word to, um, G and G, for the prototype presentation.
SPEAKER_04: Presentation.
SPEAKER_02: I will try to write a little bit of the instruction.
None: I will try.
SPEAKER_02: Jane, Jane, Jane.
SPEAKER_02: Jane and Jane.
SPEAKER_02: Jane and Jane.
None: Okay.
None: Okay, guys.
None: Take away.
None: Take away.
SPEAKER_04: This was our first concept.
SPEAKER_04: We decided to use a single touch screen.
SPEAKER_04: So we've worked out this concepts, how to hold it, where to put it.
SPEAKER_04: Um, um, well, we began with, with a form of shape, where this, uh, is easy to hold in one hand, left or right hand, so we made a little bit less thick.
SPEAKER_04: And, uh, have some artistic meaning.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yes, yes.
SPEAKER_04: Nothing.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, that's better.
SPEAKER_04: Um, well, during the meeting, I showed you the concept of placing the buttons on top, usable with the atom, and the menu structure, if necessary, with your other hand.
SPEAKER_04: So it's going to hold it easily, and it has to be accessible with your other hand too, of course.
SPEAKER_04: So we began working on the concept.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Well, as you saw, we would just have to basically mount with the panel LCD screen.
SPEAKER_01: Well, these would be the main buttons.
SPEAKER_01: You could change them later on in your own profile if you want to, but, well, standard, they will be delivered with this kind of, uh, setup, with the more, more advanced menu, uh, sitting right here, with the sub menus and stuff.
SPEAKER_01: We made a top, uh, or front view, just like you want a back view.
SPEAKER_01: As you can see, this, uh, here, there are, uh, two weird bumps in it.
SPEAKER_01: This is for the added effect of, uh, well, uh, youth and dynamic, and, uh, this is for the artistic effect.
SPEAKER_01: Well, what we figured is, uh, we'll show you a picture later on, you'll have more, a better idea after that, but the idea is for it to stay in balance with these two, uh, with these two.
SPEAKER_01: So when you put it on the table, it will just lay down.
SPEAKER_01: It won't roll around the stuff, but it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone, maybe, or like these older phones, you may get the idea.
SPEAKER_01: So this is about, uh, how we figured it should be.
SPEAKER_01: The panel, you would hide with some more, uh, rubber layers, like we discussed earlier on.
SPEAKER_01: Uh, you would, you wouldn't see the, uh, straight panel, but more fluidly and round.
SPEAKER_04: The panel is this, uh, of course, goes like this.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: But the overlaying layer is, uh, a little bit, uh, curved and stuff.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And, uh, in these bumps, you could actually, uh, put some electronics so that the wood, you could make a more thinner, uh, design.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And that would actually look very nice.
SPEAKER_01: And, uh, about color, what, hey?
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah, that this, um, can be held with your hands, so this, maximum is, oh, yeah, one and a half centimeters.
SPEAKER_04: So you have room here for your battery, and maybe even other, uh, electronic chips.
SPEAKER_04: So you can just be the, uh, the layer of the touch screen and some, some wires underneath it to make it as, uh, clean as possible in the middle for good, great.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Uh, as color state, do you have a picture in there?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Now, this is the idea about, uh, the bumps.
SPEAKER_01: You can see there's a, a very, a useful, uh, dynamic, uh, exterior.
SPEAKER_01: You just want to hold it if you, uh, you are young and, uh, dynamic like us.
SPEAKER_02: Like, uh, Easter egg.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's like, but this is for children.
SPEAKER_01: We, we want more adult version, but this is like a remote control for children.
SPEAKER_01: It's called a we-mode.
SPEAKER_01: We-mode.
SPEAKER_01: A we-mode.
SPEAKER_01: A we-mode.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Hey, that's actually a brilliant marketing stand.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Well, where the hell got it mine?
SPEAKER_01: So this is actually basically the idea.
SPEAKER_01: We, we just want to build a more adult version of, of this.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I can imagine that.
SPEAKER_01: And, and for colors, we, we figured starting with basic colors like, uh, white or metallic gray.
SPEAKER_01: There was some, uh, technological colors actually.
SPEAKER_04: It would be best to appeal to a broad public and make the coffers exchangeable.
SPEAKER_04: So the young people will buy an orange in a red, you know, blue, and whatever.
SPEAKER_04: But when, uh, all our people, they go in the shop and they see, uh, an orange, um, remote control, it would be less appealing than a white one.
SPEAKER_04: And young people, we think, are a little bit more flexible.
SPEAKER_04: I think, I'll buy for a couple of euros and no, nice hit.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover.
SPEAKER_02: So that you can pick a cover in the, uh, in the shop.
SPEAKER_04: I think a cover is necessary because of the actual, the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_04: So there must be some cheap standard cover, um, maybe white or something that comes with it.
SPEAKER_04: And you can buy so we can make extra.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but you, you mustn't forget that, uh, our target aim is younger people.
SPEAKER_03: We had decided to, uh, put some flashy, fruity colors in it.
SPEAKER_03: And, uh, in the survey from Milan in Paris, uh, it, uh, it came out that, uh, the older people are, uh, more willing to, uh, to spend money on extra futures.
SPEAKER_03: So I think, uh, it will be a better idea to have some, uh, the other way around.
SPEAKER_00: The other way around.
SPEAKER_03: The other way around.
SPEAKER_03: As, as standard.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: For the people who, uh, really want, uh, more sophisticated, more traditional look, they are willing to pay, uh, that.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: They want, uh, they want more luxury stuff, but they have to money to do it and they want to buy that.
SPEAKER_03: So maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I might be, uh, perhaps, alright.
SPEAKER_01: I would, I would actually agree with this sounds logical.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Another idea.
SPEAKER_02: Uh, maybe we could, uh, develop a cover, uh, with wood style.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Then you please, uh, elder users as well.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Well, yeah, a color of wood style, a white, and, uh, a couple of, uh, fruity colors.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And, uh, delivered standard with a fruity color, but not too, not too much.
SPEAKER_04: This is a banana and mango, not, not purple, orange and yellow.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But, uh, the main, I think, uh, the standard must be some kind of, uh, uh, attractive, flashy colors, not too, but, uh, a little, yeah, like, like, like, like, this, this, and,
SPEAKER_01: this isn't too much, is it? Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Well, the button, well, and the button is, uh, all, uh, except for the buttons,
SPEAKER_02: it could be a standard model.
SPEAKER_01: Uh, something like this would be nice. Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: That's, that's you for the most.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: It's my time now.
None: It's very dangerous.
SPEAKER_03: The marketing expert.
SPEAKER_01: Uh-oh.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: During, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
SPEAKER_02: During, uh, design, design life cycle, we, uh, we made a lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff.
SPEAKER_02: Um, now it's the time to, uh, evaluate our prototype concept to, uh, to the past requirements.
SPEAKER_02: So we're going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis.
SPEAKER_02: Um, we're going to do that with a seven point scale.
SPEAKER_02: Opening a word document now.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: One.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_02: Uh, I have to explain something.
SPEAKER_02: We have to.
SPEAKER_02: Uh, be consensive about things.
SPEAKER_02: So there's to be a group, uh, group decision.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So we're going to, we're going to, we're going to vote.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The thing we need.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: One.
SPEAKER_02: The remote controls designed for people with age below 40.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Seven.
SPEAKER_02: Seven is false.
SPEAKER_02: Two.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: One more.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: One.
SPEAKER_01: I think most two.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's not just designed for people under the age of 40.
SPEAKER_01: It's also designed for people above 40.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So, uh, one is appropriate.
SPEAKER_02: There are no, no, no.
SPEAKER_02: We're like a four.
SPEAKER_01: Now, uh, three or two or three because it's not just a question of aim that is designed for people with age below 40.
SPEAKER_01: But it's also designed for people.
SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
SPEAKER_04: Also, it's about to be primary appealing to minus 40, but also to also for.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: The second, the remote controls beautiful.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Wow.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: There's the user interface.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: User interface.
None: Expert.
SPEAKER_01: Data text buttons and volume buttons.
SPEAKER_01: No, data text buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Data text.
SPEAKER_01: Data text in the menu.
SPEAKER_04: False.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.

SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Big and clear.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Big and clear.
SPEAKER_04: You could make a telltakes button six, otherwise people read my, uh, I'm going to think we have no telltakes.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But the telltakes button, yeah, you could.
SPEAKER_01: It's not your show, it's.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not a patient entirely unclear.
SPEAKER_01: But so I wouldn't give it a seven.
SPEAKER_01: I would give it a more than five for the six.
SPEAKER_01: Five?
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: I was thinking very black and white.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Black and red.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you, Jerry.
SPEAKER_03: Glad.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: We have to get the same volume.
SPEAKER_02: The remote control is easy to be found.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Well, we put fancy colors here.
SPEAKER_01: And it has these all these fruity colors and it has a strange shape.
SPEAKER_01: So yeah.
SPEAKER_04: But trouble finding it.
SPEAKER_04: It's not making any sounds.
SPEAKER_02: No, okay.
SPEAKER_02: So.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Look, if you put your normal remote control under your bed or you throw the remote control under your bed,
SPEAKER_04: is it better finding a more make a difference? We have the better.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: I think so.
SPEAKER_04: My remote control is black.
SPEAKER_02: A little bit maybe?
SPEAKER_02: A little bit.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Or we can do it glow in the dark.
SPEAKER_03: So it's even a dark place you feel.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think five.
SPEAKER_02: It doesn't really make a lot of...
SPEAKER_01: Well, then I'll go for four.
SPEAKER_01: Four?
SPEAKER_01: Because four is between three and between three.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_04: So I'll go for four.
SPEAKER_02: I must see that.
SPEAKER_03: Between four and six.
SPEAKER_03: Well, according to the other remote controllers, there may be there in your TV room.
SPEAKER_03: This one will stand out.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's better question actually.
SPEAKER_03: I think that's 51 or more small drawer.
SPEAKER_03: You'll find it.
SPEAKER_03: If it's like on your couch, you think what's that for kind of old stuff.
SPEAKER_02: But the survey on their users was that they really lost it.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, that's stupid.
SPEAKER_02: Not seeing it, but lost it in the house or something.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_01: If you see a strange shape lying somewhere, then you'd recognize it as, whoa, that's a strange...
SPEAKER_04: That's a remote control.
SPEAKER_02: What is that?
SPEAKER_02: I agree, I agree.
SPEAKER_02: Most of the time you lose it.
SPEAKER_02: So you're most control us fresh food to color.
SPEAKER_04: I would call it juice too, because we decided not to make two fresh colors.
SPEAKER_02: Not too fresh.
SPEAKER_02: The remote controls made of soft material.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, rubber is kind of soft.
SPEAKER_01: Kind of soft, but not too soft.
SPEAKER_03: Not too silo.
SPEAKER_03: Three.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, is it used?
SPEAKER_03: Easy to use.
SPEAKER_03: Easy to use?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, can it be zero?
SPEAKER_03: Well, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's the kind of...
SPEAKER_01: It's easy to use.
SPEAKER_02: It's not the most easy to use.
SPEAKER_04: No, you can do two, because it can be easier.
SPEAKER_04: It can be easier.
SPEAKER_02: Just with ten buttons.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but then you lose our function.
SPEAKER_04: Functionality and our fancy look.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but the most easy to use.
SPEAKER_02: It's just with one button.
SPEAKER_04: But the other easy to use, because you have primary buttons always.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay, but not the most easy to use.
SPEAKER_01: I'll go for two.
SPEAKER_01: My vote's from two.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, my two.
SPEAKER_02: We also have to compare it to the remote controls on the market nowadays.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, wait, it's just a minute.
SPEAKER_04: Inspiration.
SPEAKER_03: What's the time we also have to do the evaluation in the protocol?
SPEAKER_02: Regular remote stuff.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I'm having...
SPEAKER_02: Okay, 11.
SPEAKER_02: The remote controls are innovative.
SPEAKER_04: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: Two, one.
SPEAKER_04: I agree, Tim.
SPEAKER_03: Of course.
SPEAKER_03: You have seen a more innovative thing in the remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Remote control is...
SPEAKER_02: Remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Remote control.
SPEAKER_04: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: One.
SPEAKER_04: Very multifunctional.
None: No.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: The remote control...
SPEAKER_02: It has speech recognition.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: This is used with speech recognition.
SPEAKER_02: The remote control has building games.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: But maybe make it too, because the games are in a sub menu.
SPEAKER_04: And it's not...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but they are built in, so it's one.
SPEAKER_01: I know, built in.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Last.
SPEAKER_02: Last.
SPEAKER_01: Last.
SPEAKER_01: You're really like the parental advice.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: Did you make this, Ruder?
SPEAKER_04: I'd say fast.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he made it.
SPEAKER_01: He changed it, now.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I will...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
None: Do the...
SPEAKER_02: The math.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, dear.
SPEAKER_02: How is your turn?
SPEAKER_02: Okay, thank you.
SPEAKER_03: Let's see.
None: Hmm?
SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, we have now to calculate the production cost.
SPEAKER_03: If it's under 12.5 euro, then it's...
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: But is it...
SPEAKER_03: If it is...
SPEAKER_03: No, this is right.
SPEAKER_03: No, we design.
SPEAKER_03: If you're under...
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: If they...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Tomorrow.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's good.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's...
SPEAKER_03: Sorry.
SPEAKER_03: If the costs are under 12.5 euro, then we can move on to the...
SPEAKER_03: Project evaluation, as we have experienced it.
SPEAKER_03: Otherwise, we have to do a little redesign thingy.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_03: We have to fill in the numbers.
SPEAKER_03: After components.
SPEAKER_03: After components, we have to...
SPEAKER_03: We want to do it in.
SPEAKER_03: And see if we stay under the 12.5 euro.
SPEAKER_03: So, do we have a hand dynamo?
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: That's zero.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Battery one?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Can I have one?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Solar cells?
SPEAKER_03: Zero.

SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: Simple chips.
SPEAKER_03: Simple sensor.
SPEAKER_03: Simple speaker.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: A false chip.
SPEAKER_02: It's three.
SPEAKER_02: Three?
SPEAKER_02: Three euros.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, one.
SPEAKER_02: One thing?
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_03: Three euros.
SPEAKER_01: No, zero.
SPEAKER_01: What's a sample sensor?
SPEAKER_01: Well, that's...
SPEAKER_01: Speed recognition.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, speed recognition.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_03: One.
SPEAKER_03: Zero.
SPEAKER_03: Uncurved flat.
SPEAKER_03: No, zero.
SPEAKER_03: But is it...
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: It's not made from a single uncurved thingy and then...
SPEAKER_00: No.
SPEAKER_03: And then...
SPEAKER_03: No, okay.
SPEAKER_03: So, it's only once double-curved.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, because the layer around it...
SPEAKER_04: It's around the bubbles on the...
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: We're now in a problem.
SPEAKER_03: Because we have...
SPEAKER_03: Which...
SPEAKER_03: 11 euros.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We don't have anything else.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, go on.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, go on.
SPEAKER_01: We'll see...

SPEAKER_03: Detanium.
SPEAKER_03: Detanium, no.
SPEAKER_04: Special...
SPEAKER_04: Special color?
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so, not.
SPEAKER_01: No, it's a standard color.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, this is a special color.
SPEAKER_03: We want to make the wood colors.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, if you're honest with your type...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but it's a special color.
SPEAKER_02: That's an adult.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's another brand.
SPEAKER_02: That's another article...
SPEAKER_02: To sell.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but we can't...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's true.
SPEAKER_03: But yeah, it doesn't account for this.
SPEAKER_04: No, you will finish and list first and then look back.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, they're push-button, no.
SPEAKER_04: No.
SPEAKER_04: Skull wheel, no.
SPEAKER_03: Skull wheel, no.

SPEAKER_03: We don't have first.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_01: No, we're only four here, all over budget.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so what's the thing we can change?
SPEAKER_01: Well, are there...
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so we can make it single-curved or uncurved.
SPEAKER_00: Can I...
SPEAKER_00: I say something?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, of course.
SPEAKER_03: Can I say something as project managers?
SPEAKER_03: Just good on...
SPEAKER_03: The kinetic thing.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Can we just skip it?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Because you have to shake it, but that's not really enough.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, we just put a bit better in it.
SPEAKER_04: Mobile phone nowadays.
SPEAKER_02: Daniel.
SPEAKER_02: Yo.
SPEAKER_02: What do you talk about?
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: What do you think about putting a battery in it?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But also selling like the coffers, a docking station, just apart from the thing, so that you can put...
SPEAKER_02: Rechargeable batteries in it.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, just...
SPEAKER_04: But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway.
SPEAKER_04: This is just...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, not really enough.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_03: But we forget about the kinetic.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, sure.
SPEAKER_03: Well, if we do that, we shall leave 30 to health.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, well, you can go from double-curved to single-curved.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Of course.
SPEAKER_01: And that will solve the budget problem.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so we have to make...
SPEAKER_03: But the single-curved...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Single-curved is just...
SPEAKER_04: It's just...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, well, the single-curved...
SPEAKER_04: One-curved.
SPEAKER_04: And not the back-curved, I think.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Exactly, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That's one option.
SPEAKER_03: That's one option.
SPEAKER_03: And then, yeah, we could have it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But it's a main point of the...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but we'll do it.
SPEAKER_04: So, then we have to cut out.
SPEAKER_04: We got one.
SPEAKER_04: We got a tip.
SPEAKER_03: There's a little bit of problem.
SPEAKER_03: No, that can be done.
SPEAKER_03: So, although can we make it with a bag of...
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: A little less...
SPEAKER_03: Problems.
SPEAKER_03: Hey.
SPEAKER_02: Those are...
SPEAKER_02: Arks.
SPEAKER_02: What are they for?
SPEAKER_02: Blue...
SPEAKER_03: Blue...
SPEAKER_03: Fill in the name of the event.
SPEAKER_03: Just...
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Explanation.
SPEAKER_03: I can delete it for you if you want.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, no, no.
SPEAKER_03: So, if we do this, we are on 12 and a half Euro.
SPEAKER_03: And we're done.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but does it fit without design?
SPEAKER_04: Do we actually add that?
SPEAKER_03: Well, the only thing that don't...
SPEAKER_03: Single curves.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, single curves, but there's a curve in it.
SPEAKER_04: So, we just make the bubbles cut off the back and then...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we just make it flat.
SPEAKER_01: But...
SPEAKER_02: You do look at...
SPEAKER_02: Look, what is the...
SPEAKER_02: If you make it double-curved, it costs one Euro more.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: But...
SPEAKER_02: You make it optional.
SPEAKER_02: No, but...
SPEAKER_02: Does it have a lot of extra...
SPEAKER_02: Actually, function more...
SPEAKER_01: Yes, it does.
SPEAKER_01: Does it have added work?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, aesthetic value, but not function.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's really aesthetic value.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, you make like 11.5 Euro as a profit.
SPEAKER_02: Instead of 12.5, but...
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if 12.5 is a fixed price.
SPEAKER_02: Now, let's assume it is.
SPEAKER_01: We wish it assumed that it is.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think the kinetic would be a marketing promotion.
SPEAKER_01: If you promote kinetic...
SPEAKER_01: kinetic remote control, I mean, that would sell better than a normal remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Do you think?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Well, now you can shake your remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I mean, you can go into your neighborhood and tell me, Ha, mic remote control is kinetic.
SPEAKER_01: You have a standard old,
SPEAKER_02: electric control remote control.
SPEAKER_04: What about all the environment freaks? Yeah, but it does fit in a cost profile.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's...
SPEAKER_04: Good like this one.
SPEAKER_04: You make a make a...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And a specialized extra gold version.
SPEAKER_03: Because if you want to go to kinetic, you're an attorney in a health and you must go to flat.
SPEAKER_03: And I think now it's more of a compromise.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And if you make the single curve, just a big curve, then it's...
SPEAKER_00: That is one big...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, one big...
SPEAKER_03: Good curve.
SPEAKER_03: I was going to say nasty words, but I get it.
SPEAKER_03: This is strange, by the way.
SPEAKER_03: Wood is cheaper than rubber.
SPEAKER_03: We thought that wood would be more expensive.
SPEAKER_04: But it's not as good as a figure.
SPEAKER_03: It's just cut down some trees.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, maybe.
SPEAKER_03: But this is it?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, this is it.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, this makes it more...
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to save it.
SPEAKER_01: It is possible, but you can't use double curves for titanium.
SPEAKER_01: That's one of the functionality.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, well...
SPEAKER_02: Considering we have...
SPEAKER_02: We have to do all those hours again.
SPEAKER_02: Back.
SPEAKER_02: One back?
SPEAKER_02: Gosh, no, really sorry.
SPEAKER_03: Well, we were above.
SPEAKER_03: We did a little redesign.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it's that rule.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Now it's about time to talk about this project.
SPEAKER_03: Some things.
SPEAKER_03: Were there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings?
SPEAKER_02: I didn't think so.
SPEAKER_02: There was a lot of room for it.
SPEAKER_02: But that's mainly because of the information that was delivered to us.
SPEAKER_02: It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there.
SPEAKER_02: I couldn't go on the internet and fix my own stuff.
SPEAKER_03: That's true.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I think you two, especially you and then you both had the less creative roles in the project.
SPEAKER_04: That's true.
SPEAKER_04: I think you could just sign up and remove it, if you'd like.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That's true.
SPEAKER_01: I think you're room and I.
SPEAKER_01: We had more design.
SPEAKER_01: We had more room for creativity than you two.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's true.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: How about the leadership?
SPEAKER_02: Leadership was crappy.
SPEAKER_01: The leadership wasn't crappy.
SPEAKER_01: It was the leader that was crappy.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, thank you.
SPEAKER_01: Leadership was okay.
SPEAKER_04: No, we're done.
SPEAKER_04: Example of crappy.
SPEAKER_02: Leadership was...
SPEAKER_04: Okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I thought the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting.
SPEAKER_02: You could have...
SPEAKER_02: It was your first no disrespect or something, but you could have structured it a little bit more.
SPEAKER_02: I was talking most of the time, the first meeting.
SPEAKER_04: You could have shut up, you know?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I know the situation too.
SPEAKER_03: I was also very unhappy, very unsatisfied about me.
SPEAKER_03: About the first meeting.
SPEAKER_03: I hope...
SPEAKER_03: And we will never do it again.
SPEAKER_03: Get better.
SPEAKER_03: I think the last two meetings, also we reached some good decisions.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, more consensus.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, we were more constructive.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So that's cool.
SPEAKER_03: Teamwork?
SPEAKER_03: Well, maybe that's only...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, well, it's for us.
SPEAKER_04: Well, we work together on the project, but everybody has their own tasks.
SPEAKER_03: More like presentations, some points we're discussing.
SPEAKER_03: Really teamwork where you two...
SPEAKER_03: Two or three.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it went well.
SPEAKER_01: It's just...
SPEAKER_01: The heart of feelings.
SPEAKER_01: Stupid pain by the...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we had some trouble with the pain by the way.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you must push here a little while.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but there was something difficult.
SPEAKER_04: Just write your name right now.
SPEAKER_04: Try to write your name.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Just a little bit smaller, ankle-width quicker now.
SPEAKER_04: You can go quicker because then it won't notice it.
SPEAKER_04: Ah, he knows how it works.
SPEAKER_04: I followed a masterclass for the small one.
SPEAKER_03: I think that's the main issue.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So, about this one, you were dealing with...
SPEAKER_03: The digital pen?
SPEAKER_03: The idea is great, but the work probably...
SPEAKER_03: The digital pen, I thought the first time I did individual work, I used it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But the first two meetings, I brought up the project.
SPEAKER_02: I was thinking about the digital pen.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but the first two meetings, I brought up with me, but I didn't use it at all after the first meeting.
SPEAKER_02: No, I have a feeling.
SPEAKER_02: But it's not real useful.
SPEAKER_01: No, it doesn't have that much added value to it.
SPEAKER_04: As I said a few moments ago, I would like myself to write with a normal pen because it must...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it's almost the same concept, but you can just...
SPEAKER_04: You can simply put it on your scanner, it's the same concept, it must depend on...
SPEAKER_04: You have to download the software, it's very slow.
SPEAKER_03: And it is still your own handwriting, it's up and up and...
SPEAKER_04: It doesn't give any added value.
SPEAKER_03: No, not really.
SPEAKER_03: And the smartboard is useful, but the pen is not user-friendly, I think.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, not user-friendly.
SPEAKER_03: It takes a lot of time to draw things and write things.
SPEAKER_02: It's not very precise, we're trying to...
SPEAKER_04: Like when you do this.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, and try to write your name in a normal size, yeah?
SPEAKER_02: Smaller?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, smaller, just when you're writing on a letter.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but that's not...
SPEAKER_03: When you send an add-up for an audience, you don't gonna write...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, as you saw on this drawing, it's open, open this one or that one.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, we had more problems even here.
SPEAKER_04: When we tried to draw these buttons, it's almost impossible, we can clear the values when you're...
SPEAKER_03: But maybe there's some function with...
SPEAKER_03: No, it isn't.
SPEAKER_04: And the eraser was not a problem, it's this large.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, you try to erase this line.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I'm gonna erase my name.
SPEAKER_04: I'm gonna erase my name.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's a big eraser.
SPEAKER_04: New ideas?
SPEAKER_04: What kind of new ideas?
SPEAKER_03: Well, the idea of the touchscreen is...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, two years.
SPEAKER_03: Go on.
SPEAKER_03: I'm just...
SPEAKER_04: New ideas about the working of this software, about the project, about remote control.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know what I mean.
None: What?
None: What?
None: What's the word?
SPEAKER_03: Did you word what you said?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what I mean.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what I mean.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I have some figure.
SPEAKER_02: Here.
SPEAKER_02: The evaluation.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The mean number is 1.8, 1.86.
SPEAKER_02: So that's fairly good, I think.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, because what does it mean?
SPEAKER_02: So true.
SPEAKER_02: That...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, the requirements...
SPEAKER_02: Are true or varied?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: Excellent.
SPEAKER_03: But the new ideas found with working with this software?
None: Not really.
SPEAKER_04: Not really.
SPEAKER_04: You have to improve it.
SPEAKER_04: The concept is okay.
SPEAKER_04: I think, but it has to be quicker.
SPEAKER_04: It's still opening my program.
SPEAKER_04: Almost all my entire computers locked up.
SPEAKER_04: You need process.
SPEAKER_04: And it just takes too many time.
SPEAKER_04: People will still feel the need to write it quickly on a page and not download it and save it.
SPEAKER_03: You are expected to be more user friendly.
SPEAKER_04: When you use a pen, you can just draw like you normally.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe the idea you proposed is a screen here.
SPEAKER_02: You draw it and it's placed over there.
SPEAKER_04: Or at least when you don't have to adapt to technology, you can write in a way you normally write.
SPEAKER_04: Now you have to keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen.
SPEAKER_04: That's a very bad concept.
SPEAKER_02: That's very bad.
SPEAKER_04: No.
SPEAKER_02: I think that this is better than regular flipovers.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it can be saved easier.
SPEAKER_04: But if you're in normal flipover, a lot of people write text.
SPEAKER_04: It's not a text option.
SPEAKER_04: Writing text, you've got to really do your best.
SPEAKER_03: And maybe some functions for a circle or a square.
SPEAKER_03: You have to draw it yourself.
SPEAKER_04: Now maybe even insert picture.
SPEAKER_04: If you have some presentation.
SPEAKER_01: Or text function.
SPEAKER_01: Type text.
SPEAKER_01: That would be an X-level.
SPEAKER_02: Well, insert image.
SPEAKER_02: Isn't available.
SPEAKER_02: Because then you could picture from scanner clip.
SPEAKER_02: That can be done already.
SPEAKER_02: But not the hyperlink.
SPEAKER_03: Predefined squares.
SPEAKER_02: Hey, what if you do like hyperlink?
SPEAKER_04: There will be a Google.com.
SPEAKER_02: Real reaction door for now.
SPEAKER_02: That's okay.
SPEAKER_04: You'll just make a link in.
SPEAKER_04: Well, that's nice.
SPEAKER_04: There's one way to get double-click it.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe if you're not using the erase.
SPEAKER_03: Or erase.
SPEAKER_02: Sorry.
SPEAKER_02: Something else.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
None: Select.
SPEAKER_02: Double-click.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Are you have, as you saw, you have a little, you can, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: You can go.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: There.
SPEAKER_03: So there, the functionality is there.
SPEAKER_03: But it's not ideal.
SPEAKER_03: And it's very, it costs a lot of time to use.
SPEAKER_04: To use.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And that's a pity.
SPEAKER_03: If you, if you have 30, 40 minutes, yeah, or just kind of things.
SPEAKER_03: And we are now with four people.
SPEAKER_03: Well, imagine you are here with 10 people.
SPEAKER_04: Everyone has to.
SPEAKER_04: That's obviously the case from here with the management.
SPEAKER_04: You get two minutes to make your case.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Two minutes to drawing.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: You'll rather use PowerPoints and work it out in a fun.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And one or two things you have to draw when you're there.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: This is the flip board.
SPEAKER_02: What I really miss also is, is it, is it a hurdle?
SPEAKER_02: It's a decision, decision system like, with the evaluation.
SPEAKER_02: You have to, both like, what do you want, the one or two?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe a little application like, give your number and click one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, just like you said with the screen, which you can write, also, a voting and I can just,
SPEAKER_02: voting application, just a little group, group decision application.
SPEAKER_01: But the problem is, well, you can't discuss anything.
SPEAKER_01: Well, you can, but you will discuss a lot less than, like we did now.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, one person maybe said free, but we said, no, I'll think too, because this and this, and then you can react on it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But if you put a free on it, just figure out, well, everybody knows what I'm knowing, so they'll all just put it to on.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, of course.
SPEAKER_02: But you can still discuss about it, but click it in an application.
SPEAKER_02: That's a lot easier to process.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, okay, for processing.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But then I think the idea of one person entering it and the rest discussing it, that isn't that bad idea, actually.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Not that your opinion isn't valued, but still.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So, manager.
SPEAKER_03: That's it.
SPEAKER_04: Well, just about, just when are we going to produce it?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Tomorrow.
SPEAKER_03: Celebrate.
SPEAKER_03: Because we're within the budget, the project is a failureite, but before we go to celebrate, I have a little question which you can't answer, because there must be some kind of entry port.
SPEAKER_03: I'm busy with the entry port right now.
SPEAKER_03: You might think, what the hell is he doing?
SPEAKER_02: What is an entry port?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, about all the meetings, what we have decided.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: A report of this day.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That must be made, but I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: Here is the standing.
SPEAKER_03: Well, we can celebrate now, but the entry port is.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, 10 minutes left.
SPEAKER_02: I ran.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, if not, 10 minutes left to finish of the entry.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Well, that can be done.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe we can do it together.
SPEAKER_03: You can see when I've.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I will put it on a storyboard.
SPEAKER_03: You can see it.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I think it will be your, my better version.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's a three, 75 pages.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: 75 pages.
SPEAKER_03: Well, just a moment.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, Daniel.
SPEAKER_02: You want a chair?
SPEAKER_02: Maybe.
SPEAKER_02: A chair, man.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, man.
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no, no, I'm just.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, you can, you can read it.
SPEAKER_03: And here it is.
SPEAKER_01: So you finish it, actually, so we just have to read it.
SPEAKER_01: And so yes or no?
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Well, it's not read only, but it's not five minutes yet for finishing.
SPEAKER_03: This is about the functional design.
SPEAKER_03: Management expert.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: You have to change that.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: When I said it, I remember I said it only version.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but you can save it on another name.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Mark thing, actually.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: About three functions, which are most used, and which must immediately be visible on our remote control.
SPEAKER_03: It must be simple to use, very clear what to do, and the younger people.
SPEAKER_03: So this is really about what kind of things must be in it.
SPEAKER_02: And maybe.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I understand you.
SPEAKER_03: I can talk a little bit.
SPEAKER_02: You have to pull switch channels at the top, because that's the most functional.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_02: Data text at the second.
SPEAKER_03: I really didn't follow.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, volume changing second.
SPEAKER_03: So this one's for switch.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: You go there and you go there.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Go on.
SPEAKER_03: Well, maybe I can do it.
SPEAKER_03: One, two, three.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Very good.
SPEAKER_03: Three.
SPEAKER_03: If the order is in this important, that's the word for four.
SPEAKER_03: The order.
SPEAKER_03: Then the conceptual design.
SPEAKER_03: Well, all the things we have discussed, the energy, which turn out to be a battery.
SPEAKER_03: So that's working.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe you can add it later.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We decided.
SPEAKER_03: Because, yeah, because because.
SPEAKER_03: It is still double-carved.
SPEAKER_03: The rubber, the plushie, the fruity, the removable.
SPEAKER_03: It's not double anymore, eh?
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no anymore.
SPEAKER_03: But this is what was initialed.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And the added functions like that are snake, it's in the parent control, touch screen.
SPEAKER_03: So it's just a summary of what we had discussed.
SPEAKER_01: One small thing, the added functions.
SPEAKER_01: Was it included in the cost?
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01: That's very cheap.
SPEAKER_04: It's very cheap.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe you come at.
SPEAKER_02: No, it's not very cheap, but it's very necessary.
SPEAKER_02: No, but it's development inside corporation.
SPEAKER_02: Like we don't have to buy parental control around people can.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I still.
SPEAKER_02: It has some thoughts.
SPEAKER_03: But, okay.
SPEAKER_00: So we can discuss that.
SPEAKER_03: We can discuss that kind of things, I think, with the board of the lecture.
SPEAKER_03: What's the company call?
SPEAKER_03: I just keep forgetting it.
SPEAKER_03: Real reaction.
SPEAKER_03: Real reaction.
SPEAKER_03: I thought.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Real reaction.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you can ask.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So anybody misses something here about the end conclusion.
SPEAKER_03: But yeah, okay, that's what I'm going to write.
SPEAKER_03: The end conclusion, that's all I'd say.
SPEAKER_03: And here nothing.
SPEAKER_04: The decision to make the buttons on the top and the menu on the bottom.
SPEAKER_04: And clearly touch screen you've mentioned.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, touch screen I've been thinking about.
SPEAKER_02: But the decisions are put in the conclusion, I think.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Why we decided to use a flat LCD.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I'm going to redesign something now.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Because I think it will have five minutes from to finish meeting.
SPEAKER_04: Anything for you change anything maybe you saved the first.
SPEAKER_04: You can select file and export and then the feedback files.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but then you add the same thing.
SPEAKER_04: Well, eight.
SPEAKER_04: We have another blank one.
SPEAKER_04: For example, children.
SPEAKER_02: Anything?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, wait.
SPEAKER_02: Wow.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: It's a new way commercial logo.
SPEAKER_02: That's a plate.
SPEAKER_04: Don't say that.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, that's cool.
SPEAKER_03: Finish meeting now.
SPEAKER_04: Why are only the first five smartphones?
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to finish my entry for.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Hereby's meeting is finished.
SPEAKER_03: You declare I am the one who can say that.
SPEAKER_03: Hereby the meeting is finished.
None: Yeah.
None: And also the finished.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: How about the entry for?
None: You can go to the next.
None: Yeah.
None: Okay.
None: What the fuck?
SPEAKER_01: That is quite an editing sound.
SPEAKER_03: I'm a questioner.
