SPEAKER_01: things are expensive.
None: For blah blah.
SPEAKER_00: Fight.
SPEAKER_02: Got to close this?
SPEAKER_02: We don't have any changes.
SPEAKER_02: So no.
SPEAKER_04: There we go.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, here we are again.
SPEAKER_01: Detailed design.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, come on.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I forgot to insert the minutes, but it's about the same thing we discussed before.
SPEAKER_01: It opened anyway.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: Other design.
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, we took rubber as the material last time.
SPEAKER_01: We also know that you just been busy with it.
SPEAKER_01: Took the advanced ship to implement the advanced features.
SPEAKER_01: Well, we discussed the design.
SPEAKER_01: Note sharp corners we rounded it off.
SPEAKER_01: Like you see on the other screen.
SPEAKER_01: Just fine.
SPEAKER_01: We agreed that the color should be yellow and black.
SPEAKER_01: We'll be in the back because it's more trendy than black anyway.
SPEAKER_01: So I'm okay.
SPEAKER_01: We agreed that we would implement both LCD and speed recognition.
SPEAKER_01: But I'll get to that in a moment.
SPEAKER_01: Because some changes in the financials have left us some implications anyway.
SPEAKER_01: So like I said, we had no inside of finances, no prices, but we have them now.
SPEAKER_01: And it's bad.
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, we are a prototype presentation.
SPEAKER_01: Well, first you guys built the prototype.
SPEAKER_01: So you could present that.
SPEAKER_00: But let's see what we had to do.
SPEAKER_01: No, just go ahead and present the will scrap it later because I think it's more as the same.
SPEAKER_02: It's basically what we agreed upon.
SPEAKER_00: Just to do it.
SPEAKER_00: I haven't changed that much.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, not at all.
SPEAKER_01: I didn't expect any.
SPEAKER_01: You just colored it.
SPEAKER_02: And final design.
SPEAKER_02: Basically, you knew what we discussed, covered buttons for we made a rubber, yellow color, black components.
SPEAKER_02: As you can see right over here.
SPEAKER_02: I like the menu.
SPEAKER_02: It shows a different type of color for the menu, a bit darker yellow.
SPEAKER_02: So that come really shows in this keypad.
SPEAKER_02: If you put them all black, it's not really that good a contrast.
SPEAKER_01: And I suppose the yellow is not printed on the rubber.
SPEAKER_01: It's part of the rubber, I suppose.
SPEAKER_01: Probably.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think that's more durable anyway, than printed on to.
SPEAKER_02: It's more easier to just paint it on the rubber than to the integration story again.
SPEAKER_02: So we have it's a bit round shape.
SPEAKER_02: That's what we had.
SPEAKER_02: We chose the buttons to be teletext, okay button, favorite channel and the mute.
SPEAKER_02: So that's basically what we chose there.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: You have anything to add please.
SPEAKER_03: No, this is just a description of what we see there.
None: So yeah.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That's pretty much it.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: That's my time to ruin everything.
SPEAKER_01: Well, not ruin everything, but.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, sorry.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: Finances.
SPEAKER_01: That's what we have here.
SPEAKER_01: What you drew.
SPEAKER_01: We have battery power.
SPEAKER_01: We have advanced chips and the sensor, the simple sensor and for speak recognition anyway.
SPEAKER_01: So which you see, the which is one of the most expensive parts.
SPEAKER_01: So, well, we have one curve, the design, rubber design.
SPEAKER_01: And we had a special color.
SPEAKER_01: It was supposed to be yellow, it was a special color.
SPEAKER_01: So it's just half a euro for it.
SPEAKER_01: We have push buttons and an LCD display, gives us a total of 17 euros in production cost, which is higher than the 12.5 that we are permitted to use.
SPEAKER_01: So easy.
SPEAKER_01: What do we scrape?
SPEAKER_01: I think the best solution that I came up with is just to take out the speech recognition.
SPEAKER_01: I'd say that too.
SPEAKER_01: Because the LCD has more support on customer side.
SPEAKER_01: There are 91% of the people or something like that.
SPEAKER_01: And the number of people who are in the same position as the person who favor an LCD display.
SPEAKER_02: And only 60% that favor speech recognition.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's hard to have an extra function with the speech which you can't do with normal remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Which people already do.
SPEAKER_01: So I took that out.
SPEAKER_01: So I was still stuck with 13.
SPEAKER_01: So I had to take out the special color, I suppose.
SPEAKER_01: And yeah, I didn't see anything else I could take out.
SPEAKER_01: So the push buttons, we need those.
SPEAKER_01: So, apparently what I came up with, in order to have production costs of 12.5 euros, scrape speech recognition and the separate covers can account for the, if people want it, well, just then we'll just do it in black.
SPEAKER_01: We'll just deliver it in black.
SPEAKER_01: It has all the function that it's supposed to have.
SPEAKER_01: And if you want the custom design, then you can buy the separate covers.
SPEAKER_02: Or whatever you want.
SPEAKER_02: Disagree with you on that.
SPEAKER_02: Because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this.
SPEAKER_02: So can't we just, basically extend it to 13?
SPEAKER_01: Okay, let's just see what we, now we have to be under 12.5.
SPEAKER_01: It's not, okay, there's no go.
SPEAKER_01: We go over 12.5.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: But there's another problem.
SPEAKER_03: If we take another cover, for instance, black, then we also need another button frame.
SPEAKER_03: Because black and black doesn't work, obviously.
SPEAKER_01: So I think that's what you were assigned to do really to see how both of us work together.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So I think it's one of the, it's a good way to help people to make, to keep product 22.
SPEAKER_01: Just keep, you just make new covers for it, like we agreed before.
SPEAKER_01: I agree.
SPEAKER_01: And everything that's left is the basic function that we want our product to have.
SPEAKER_01: Because the expensive parts are in the advanced chip, but we need that for the LCD display.
SPEAKER_01: Then again, we have the LCD display, which is also expensive.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but let's go together.
SPEAKER_01: And yeah, we could take out the curve.
SPEAKER_01: We could take out the curve indeed.
SPEAKER_01: We could take out the curve.
SPEAKER_01: Is that an option?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, for you.
SPEAKER_02: I think the model is more important than the really the curve.
SPEAKER_02: Because if you just end up with an entirely black, I think it's just ruined it.
SPEAKER_01: But the fact that I took that decision or took this example, actually not really a decision, but the example is because we do offer the possibility of adding your own custom cover.
SPEAKER_01: So you can change it into any color you want.
SPEAKER_01: It's just you deliver a basic remote control with the possibility to change it into whatever you want.
SPEAKER_03: Can you add another also change the material?
SPEAKER_03: We take plastic for the basic cover.
SPEAKER_01: You can take plastic, but something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really can't forward from the marketing research.
SPEAKER_01: Is that people like the pushing feeling of the spongy feeling of the...
SPEAKER_01: We can put it in a...
SPEAKER_01: It also makes it different from the existing remote control.
SPEAKER_01: It's all plastic, in terms of rubber would increase durability, because it doesn't break.
SPEAKER_03: But what do you then suggest we lose?
SPEAKER_03: Because we have to lose two things.
SPEAKER_01: Like I said, I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special color, which would make this...
SPEAKER_01: Okay, and that's enough.
SPEAKER_01: Like in gray.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's enough.
SPEAKER_02: So black in gray is okay.
SPEAKER_01: I guess those are the basic colors.
SPEAKER_02: Which we can fabricate.
SPEAKER_04: I think those people want to pay for it.
SPEAKER_04: Why do we have to keep us on the profit?
SPEAKER_01: That's the order.
SPEAKER_01: We're just a project team.
SPEAKER_01: And we got our orders from our company, which say we don't want to speak of...
SPEAKER_01: We can take more than 1250 for this.
SPEAKER_01: That's not our decision to take.
SPEAKER_01: We have a budget of 1250 per product.
SPEAKER_02: We need to stick to that.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think it's really bad either.
SPEAKER_01: We have the backup design thing.
SPEAKER_04: I hope the people would like it.
SPEAKER_01: I think they would do.
SPEAKER_01: I think they do like it.
SPEAKER_01: We agree upon that the cover thing was a nice idea, because you could have all sorts of designs, while at the same time just manufacturing one product, one basic product, which you can turn into any taste you want.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's the best solution.
SPEAKER_01: Make those custom covers for the design aspect and keep the functionality between within the boundaries of the budget.
SPEAKER_03: So you should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to say under the cost.
SPEAKER_03: They know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost.
SPEAKER_03: That they know that.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think it's worth it.
SPEAKER_01: It doesn't mean anything to the customer.
SPEAKER_03: Of course.
SPEAKER_03: We don't care that you had to.
SPEAKER_03: No, but I think the cover is such a nice idea.
SPEAKER_03: Let's, that then they allow us to make some more costs.
SPEAKER_01: We can at least tell them we didn't get that.
SPEAKER_01: You don't know what I think it should either be a pack.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe they should be sold in stores with a standard cover.
SPEAKER_03: We're not talking about that cost, but the one that has given us the order to design this.
SPEAKER_03: We could at least make it like this, but like you said, and then tell them, okay, we had to drop this and that just that you know.
SPEAKER_03: It isn't still an option, but not for this price.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's true.
SPEAKER_01: So actually, it's not that much of an increase, but yeah, we can't contact them.
SPEAKER_01: It's just the order that we got.
SPEAKER_01: That's what we got to go with.
SPEAKER_01: So it's either once just to get it through final.
SPEAKER_01: It's either turned into plastic, drop the squishy feel, make it more breakable, or turn it yellow.
SPEAKER_01: So, it's something we have to decide on.
SPEAKER_03: Let's say, lose the curve.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, that's true.
SPEAKER_01: We could lose the curve.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I forgot that.
SPEAKER_01: Sorry.
SPEAKER_01: The curve.
SPEAKER_02: So which curve is that made?
SPEAKER_02: That's basically that.
SPEAKER_01: Just this one, just the banana curve.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, so this would be straight.
SPEAKER_01: No, that would be a curve inside the thing, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: Now, would that just be a straight remark, just like that?
SPEAKER_01: Which would, yeah, turn it into something far more ordinary.
SPEAKER_01: We could make it yellow then.
SPEAKER_02: Second that.
SPEAKER_01: Second that you're second to lose the curve.
SPEAKER_02: No, that it would turn out to be a pretty straightforward remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: It's not really.
SPEAKER_01: So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve, to separate from the rest of the remote control world.
SPEAKER_01: So to speak.
SPEAKER_01: So we keep the curve.
SPEAKER_01: So the only solution is either to use to lose the yellow or lose the rubber.
SPEAKER_01: And I'm in favor of keeping the rubber because it has more advantages than the color yellow has.
SPEAKER_02: I would say.
SPEAKER_02: I would agree with you on the color because that's an extra option.
SPEAKER_02: Max or service we can deliver for a little bit more money.
SPEAKER_02: So yeah, I guess people are willing to pay for that.
SPEAKER_01: So I think we can take that option and just with the idea in the back overhead that you can customize your remote control.
SPEAKER_01: So I think that would still make it a nice product.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, we're fine on that.
SPEAKER_01: So it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing.
SPEAKER_01: But anyway, we're here.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, basically what we discussed is now.
SPEAKER_01: That's just now.
SPEAKER_01: Just could just discuss how the project went.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, it was kind of.
SPEAKER_01: I wanted to sort of expect to that.
SPEAKER_01: Everything would turn out this way, but.
SPEAKER_01: Because yeah, everything cannot be for free.
SPEAKER_01: We didn't.
SPEAKER_01: I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time because that was.
SPEAKER_01: It was really essential really to make because we spent.
SPEAKER_01: An entire stage designing a product.
SPEAKER_01: Of which we had no idea what it would cost.
SPEAKER_01: So just something.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's really.
SPEAKER_01: Nothing stroke with reality actually.
SPEAKER_01: I do.
SPEAKER_03: I felt it blind throughout the project.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, beginning I had no list of.
SPEAKER_01: I think it would have been.
SPEAKER_01: And then I had no list of available finance at least the last me.
SPEAKER_01: I would have expected had to have that.
SPEAKER_01: So let's.
SPEAKER_04: See.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, see if it sells.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, I suppose this sells because it's very.
SPEAKER_01: Very extended, but.
SPEAKER_01: Like hoping that sells.
SPEAKER_01: I suppose it sells because it's good.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's got everything for the for the reasonable price because we didn't know what it's going to cost anyway.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: That's a fairly evaluate the product of us our design.
SPEAKER_04: I have some.
SPEAKER_04: A method and requirements and scale off.
SPEAKER_04: I will present some statements and we will decide together what if it's true or false.
SPEAKER_04: Then we see if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not.
SPEAKER_04: And I will.
SPEAKER_04: Make a new blank sheet.
SPEAKER_04: So the buttons the look and feel I thought it was okay, but the advanced settings screen audio and channel.
SPEAKER_04: But your major thing.
SPEAKER_01: We are not.
SPEAKER_01: I think that is totally met because the menu really took them for the.
SPEAKER_01: They have the feel they want.
SPEAKER_01: They have the simplicity they want.
SPEAKER_01: No, it's all.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's very very well met either two or one maybe.
SPEAKER_01: I think we took that everything they wanted to consideration so it could either be a two or one.
SPEAKER_04: So.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, one and a half.
SPEAKER_04: But it's not an option.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah, it's a creator own option.
SPEAKER_04: Look and feel it.
SPEAKER_04: It's true.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, so.
SPEAKER_04: And the next one.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, when it's lost, you can find it for deaf people.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think it's perfect, but we did everything possible to get it back.
SPEAKER_01: Because it's stuck in your couch.
SPEAKER_01: You can't see the light.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe you can't hear it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, we tried.
SPEAKER_01: I think that deserves a one.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, definitely.
SPEAKER_04: That's okay.
SPEAKER_04: And the next one.
SPEAKER_04: How is that?
SPEAKER_04: We don't have a menu.
SPEAKER_04: Menu, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I think that's part of it.
SPEAKER_03: It could be a little bit more difficult than a normal emotional.
SPEAKER_03: But then again, it's for young people.
SPEAKER_04: So.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, and LCD tells a lot about.
SPEAKER_02: It's pretty straightforward.
SPEAKER_02: You have a pretty straightforward navigation.
SPEAKER_02: I'll choose to navigate through the LCD menu.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, big problem.
SPEAKER_04: So it's one or one I.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_00: I think what we did for the.
SPEAKER_01: On phones.
SPEAKER_01: So I think.
SPEAKER_01: Issue on making a menu, actually.
SPEAKER_01: And now it's just true.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think it takes no.
SPEAKER_01: It really doesn't take time to learn.
SPEAKER_01: I think we took it so easy.
SPEAKER_01: We have so little buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Everything speaks for itself, really.
SPEAKER_01: So I think it's yeah, we didn't.
SPEAKER_01: It takes no tour one.
SPEAKER_01: I guess maybe it's a two because the LCD is a little is a little new and.
SPEAKER_01: There are some options hidden under the menu button.
SPEAKER_01: So I might make it to two instead of a one.
SPEAKER_04: I guess.
SPEAKER_04: And LCD, you have to.
SPEAKER_04: See it.
SPEAKER_04: So let's make that a two.
SPEAKER_04: It's a little bit.
SPEAKER_04: Learning.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: It's a little bit same, but.
SPEAKER_04: It tells you.
SPEAKER_01: It's not in a good way.
SPEAKER_01: I think so.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's perfect.
SPEAKER_01: The where it is, what it can't do.
SPEAKER_01: If it's useful.
SPEAKER_01: I think.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: What are we.
SPEAKER_04: Displaying on the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_04: Just only the channels and.
SPEAKER_04: Or.
SPEAKER_03: In the menu, sir.
SPEAKER_03: What's like brightness and.
SPEAKER_03: Those kind of things we've put in the menu.
SPEAKER_03: Because we have no buttons for this.
SPEAKER_02: Basically the menu options indeed.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, in the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_01: The small screen.
SPEAKER_01: And for the channel selection.
SPEAKER_01: I thought it was.
SPEAKER_01: I thought the people wanted previews on there.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I thought it was possible.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Because it's.
SPEAKER_01: It requires quite a bit of bandwidth.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think it's possible already, but.
SPEAKER_01: They didn't really define what should be used for.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe a TV guide or something.
SPEAKER_01: For example, TV guides.
SPEAKER_01: I think that's.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That you can transmit.
SPEAKER_01: Do it and everything.
SPEAKER_01: Just for extra information on your programs.
SPEAKER_04: It must be clear.
SPEAKER_01: Also things like.
SPEAKER_01: What's for menus or.
SPEAKER_01: How about preferences of your.
SPEAKER_01: How about configuring your remote control for favorite.
SPEAKER_01: Your favorite channel for.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: How do you configure that.
SPEAKER_01: So that's could be done by the LCD display.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's good.
SPEAKER_01: No, maybe it's not a one because it's we're not using it perfectly.
SPEAKER_01: We didn't give it.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think we're discussing how we gave it enough thought though.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think we should just lower this for maybe maybe to three.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: You could have used it more effectively.
SPEAKER_01: Probably.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, indeed.
SPEAKER_04: So everybody's agree with.
SPEAKER_04: Free on it.
SPEAKER_04: We are using it.
SPEAKER_04: But it's not.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's not poorly used, but it's not efficiently used.
SPEAKER_01: I think.
SPEAKER_01: We could have even lost the selection button and done everything via LCD selection.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's now it's just extra to illustrate him.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's an extra feature.
SPEAKER_01: But okay.
SPEAKER_01: Free.
SPEAKER_03: That's not really only an extra.
SPEAKER_03: Nothing.
SPEAKER_03: Seven.
SPEAKER_04: Seven.
SPEAKER_04: That's a.
SPEAKER_04: Can you talk to remote control?
SPEAKER_01: Or we can say.
SPEAKER_01: Well, we can't talk anymore.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So we script that.
SPEAKER_02: Or we could say neutral because we scratch the.
SPEAKER_01: Just to be a prey.
SPEAKER_01: But of course you can talk to your remote control.
SPEAKER_01: This is doing.
SPEAKER_04: You can talk to it.
SPEAKER_04: Not with the speech recognition.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, all the trends and no colors anymore.
SPEAKER_01: So.
SPEAKER_01: Well, we did take everything in consideration, of course.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think that's okay.
SPEAKER_04: But the colors we don't have special colors.
SPEAKER_01: No, we don't have the colors.
SPEAKER_01: But we took into consideration the fact that it's customizable.
SPEAKER_01: We don't have it.
SPEAKER_02: So.
SPEAKER_02: So.
SPEAKER_01: We don't have it.
SPEAKER_01: We do have it.
SPEAKER_01: It's just sold as a package.
SPEAKER_01: It's not part of the basic product.
SPEAKER_03: Changing colors is also trends.
SPEAKER_01: That's what I call trendy.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, the shape is trendy.
SPEAKER_01: The.
SPEAKER_01: The functions are trendy.
SPEAKER_01: It's just the colors that are not supporting the basic model.
SPEAKER_01: Because yeah, it's just not affordable.
SPEAKER_01: It's not a matter of.
SPEAKER_02: Go there too then because it's not perfect because we can't do it initially.
SPEAKER_01: It's possible but you have to pay extra for the.
SPEAKER_01: For the possibility of having it on a different color.
SPEAKER_04: Oh.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: The two right?
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: The last one.
SPEAKER_04: That's a roll score overall.
SPEAKER_04: It's a.
SPEAKER_04: It's a.
SPEAKER_04: It's a.
SPEAKER_04: It's a.
SPEAKER_04: It's a.
SPEAKER_04: It's a.
SPEAKER_04: It's a.
SPEAKER_04: It's a.
SPEAKER_04: It's a.
SPEAKER_04: It's a.
SPEAKER_04: It's a.
None: It's a.
None: It's a.
SPEAKER_04: It's a.
SPEAKER_02: It should be divided.
SPEAKER_02: That's interesting.
SPEAKER_04: it's.
None: It's T 3.
SPEAKER_02: It's two two third.
SPEAKER_05: two two thirds.
SPEAKER_04: So we can say it.
SPEAKER_04: It's the product.
SPEAKER_01: It's.
SPEAKER_01: It's ok.
SPEAKER_01: mostly it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition because yeah that gives you a 7 which ruins your average without that it would be like it would be under 2 so I think even with this it's reasonable.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah if we make it into a 4 as in neutral because we didn't implement it so we can't say that we yeah and it's really not well implemented we come out on an average of 2 1 8.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think it's 2 so it's okay. Which is pretty one good. Yeah 2 is pretty good.
SPEAKER_02: It's at least on the positive side so we could definitely have done better if we've had more resources but
SPEAKER_01: yeah I think it's probably yeah. I do admit that we did miss a little or didn't talk I'm talking about the possibility of the LCD display we could have used it more efficiently we just didn't think of it that way. Yeah we've scored a few. So like I said changing channels everything hidden in your LCD display so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything.
SPEAKER_03: What I think for this price this is really a reasonable product. I think we did very well
SPEAKER_01: even if you look at this score we did quite well. With an LCD screen just looking for improvements
SPEAKER_03: what you could have improved. But if people really want speech recognition then they must be prepared to pay more. Yeah I did not mention get kids just stick them in TV and say change
SPEAKER_01: the channel. But for this price you cannot accept that. I don't think so. It's not affordable. No you should lose the LCD screen probably but I think that's the more worth the speech recognition.
SPEAKER_01: It's also more attractive. Definitely. Okay. What was that? Yeah. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So that's the final product without the speakers. I guess. Let's see what was left of that.
SPEAKER_01: Another one. Yeah we evaluate the products. General projects. What's in the product? I mean for example I thought we were pretty creative and when we created we took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example which I thought was pretty creative because it was never ever ever listed somewhere. Favorite channel? Well anyways you know leaderships up to you. I mean perhaps I screwed up because I put it for the speech recognition to do it but that's not for me. I think we did pretty well as teamwork. I was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime because when I got the input for the financial results initially of course I wanted to contact you say look this is you're doing the wrong thing you're wasting your time now because we're implementing stuff that we cannot afford so it would be better if there was more communication between the director's education which would normally do either call or email someone so that was too bad it wasn't possible here. That's the same thing that I
SPEAKER_03: didn't get. But they were using materials that I didn't have. So it didn't have or didn't
SPEAKER_01: knew what they cost or whatever. There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them so that was a little unclear I suppose. I think it's smart but smart but it was pretty cool. I think it's a question for design issues. My head's right.
SPEAKER_01: It's very easy just to give your thoughts a little easier to share them. Although for actual design
SPEAKER_02: I'd say it's a little less time. The response time is very bad because it's good to visualize
SPEAKER_01: everything but I think the response time should it could be a lot better. The digital pen was
SPEAKER_02: definitely better to draw my ideas into further elaborate on that. But there's also one problem with
SPEAKER_03: this I noticed. You have to finish a page before I don't have to. No no no no I didn't check the
SPEAKER_01: finished button. It just you just did you copy it or whatever. Okay I saw that only if you check the notes or press done then then you can then exports the word automatically. But it's not necessary to check either one of those two. Okay but I made a preview you can just preview your page
SPEAKER_03: in the in the program. Okay but I made three pages and they were not finished and when the third one was finished I wanted to download it and then it was not possible anymore because you have to close all the pages before going further. Okay before starting a new page. Okay so you cannot work on one on one page at the same time. That's not possible. Okay finish it completely then download it. It's then start a new one. Yeah that's not very handy. Let's if you know that's
SPEAKER_01: done. Yeah understand it. Okay. And a new idea yeah more communication between between that's the thing I noticed the communication is very important because if you get new information it's essential for other teammates to know that as soon as possible because you would avoid making doing extra work because you were doing extra work now working on the on the speech recognition limitation both on the technical and on the design side. So I think that could have been better but that's I think it's more of a setting here that you kind of communicate
SPEAKER_02: then and somewhere else. Yeah possibly be is a more real-time information base so we can all see
SPEAKER_01: yeah I think so unless spam probably I'm not sure you got spammed as well but I get spend like every every two minutes there was another email about master classes or something so which were totally useless actually I thought I should probably look into them. They're all useless
SPEAKER_02: so I just I personally did not have that that's probably your luck distribution but I also did not really was you had that as well is that we finished up the design and then we checked the website and then there was just extra information of the five minutes yeah there was a little delay in
SPEAKER_01: that yeah I didn't have any more information it's just always the same here so that's that's kind of an email change but not for me so I had no extra information to go and I wouldn't than what you give me actually I couldn't do any research myself or that's yeah I could have done a little extra work probably but I was busy enough anyways and any ideas found or is that probably
SPEAKER_00: yeah I would say I'm doing half of this anyway I have no clue it's like
SPEAKER_01: should if the project is evaluated and it was within budget we should sell a ray
SPEAKER_02: bring out the beer champagne
SPEAKER_01: okay one more about it I'm sure what we should still do that let's see but
SPEAKER_03: all your tasks are finished right yeah I have no way you're assistant my coach is being very
SPEAKER_01: silent now yeah yeah I asked the the total report you finished up I think we took very little time now because yeah we're agreement everything the design is okay one thing we missed though we
SPEAKER_03: never a product name no how about you probably it's better than I think than a serial number Sony TR something or I think of a catchy name I'll be working on this until the beep until the
SPEAKER_04: beep show fruit name fruit name or something like that banana remote or something you don't
SPEAKER_01: want to remember banana yeah it's the problem it's not yellow because it's not yellow it's not
SPEAKER_02: yellow yeah it's curved yeah well I was going for the RC deluxe but it's not really a catchy name
SPEAKER_03: or anything it's more no it's at least it's not something with numbers numbers are so meaningless to
SPEAKER_02: be yeah something with our company name can we do anything with that everything we'll website which will help us out
SPEAKER_01: we'll react to the future RC step into the future of remote controlling your TV
SPEAKER_02: is that a name or a catchy slogan yeah or a control your remote control the real reactor
SPEAKER_01: really I go for future RC probably something
SPEAKER_03: the real reactor I don't find that that betta-do
SPEAKER_01: real reactor yeah it's a real reaction that makes me think of different products in a remote control really and that's sure we actually don't know
SPEAKER_04: this is a pink
SPEAKER_02: yeah so that's the one option reactor
SPEAKER_03: I'm looking for things in the name so at the first three that is I'll see you right the banana down or you I take sure
SPEAKER_04: remote
SPEAKER_03: banana RC the triple R real reaction remote control
SPEAKER_04: R3C do you mean it like R3C you mean it like this yeah the real reaction remote control R3C
SPEAKER_01: all right no I got it should be it should be longer because it's not a product name it should be done a box triple R doesn't just write a triple like a word triple R see triple the stripe of triple Rc
SPEAKER_04: you see the triple RC R3C
SPEAKER_01: R-C dash I think it like this more triple R triple Rc
SPEAKER_02: like a C right now or a dash and a C about do both
SPEAKER_01: sure if it looks stupid I think that the RC together takes away the the image of it's a triple the first the first one looks like it's a triple remote control but it's only a single-round control and especially on the triple R that's important
SPEAKER_03: I would react to remote I would lose to see just name it triple Rc's not it sounds like thinking about two different things and combining it I would just say triple R triple R yeah yeah triple R that's also short it's so catchy
SPEAKER_02: okay so which one are we going to scratch definitely I'd say this one as well yeah the looks I think we're all in
SPEAKER_01: agree you know the triple R triple R triple R
SPEAKER_04: triple R
SPEAKER_01: triple R you're pretty cool when you're pretty cool looks pretty cool what did you do now just like this is just just bring triple R looks doesn't look bad it's short it's okay so I've to write my report now I guess yeah so we have everything at the product we have the cost oh we have the possibility of everything okay I think it's a journey and I'm going to return to my layer and finish the report what was the short meaning what efficient though the boss has always the last one to go home
SPEAKER_00: so probably okay okay see you in a minute
SPEAKER_04: I will write that one in a word document okay
None: okay could you guys draw me a picture of the file design to put in the cover of the report
SPEAKER_03: cover I think this one I'll let's just do it all over again
SPEAKER_02: I don't really know whether we can save it as a picture of it
SPEAKER_04: is it okay if I try is it okay with you yeah okay I will ask you when I'll put it back
SPEAKER_03: I need to information so it's okay it has been saving something but I do I don't know oh can I say X-P-S X-P-S is it okay can I not split this my document is the wrong one I cannot
SPEAKER_04: it's maybe it's not on the network of the rest I don't think so
SPEAKER_03: I wouldn't take that one no that's pity that means that we have to draw it again are you gonna do that sure how Okay. Okay. Okay.
