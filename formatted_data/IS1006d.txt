None: Oh.
None: Throat.
None: Mhm.
None: Um...
SPEAKER_07: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So my Christa, it's the Heisameen.
SPEAKER_00: It's the detail design meeting, so we're going last meeting.
SPEAKER_00: So first, Marc and Rama are going to present the prototype.
SPEAKER_00: Then Samuel will propose some criteria to evaluate this prototype.
SPEAKER_00: Then we...
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Then we're going to do some findings to see if it is feasible.
SPEAKER_00: And at the end we will evaluate ourselves as a team.
SPEAKER_00: So first let's see the prototype.
SPEAKER_02: Here we have our prototype model.
SPEAKER_00: And you have some slides.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, some slides.
SPEAKER_06: So in which...
SPEAKER_06: So this is our remote control.
SPEAKER_06: It's a working prototype.
SPEAKER_06: You can use it now by switching all these buttons.
SPEAKER_06: So first I present as we came to this perfect model and then we'll give some technical specifications.
SPEAKER_06: That's...
SPEAKER_06: Well, so let's start.
SPEAKER_06: Please next slide.
SPEAKER_06: We analyzed all the fruits and contacted NASA and made some real good...
SPEAKER_06: Yeah, if you can see this and the stars are showing that we didn't write.
SPEAKER_06: And society will accept it.
SPEAKER_06: For sure.
SPEAKER_06: And making some analysis of different fruits, we choose the ultimate four, ultimate colors and ultimate smell of it.
SPEAKER_06: Please next slide.
SPEAKER_06: But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea.
SPEAKER_06: Because it's the most of the model, the ever-moder material we can select.
SPEAKER_06: And it's practical.
SPEAKER_06: And it still suits for our needs.
SPEAKER_06: So please press something.
SPEAKER_06: And as I said...
SPEAKER_06: It's great.
SPEAKER_00: It's great.
SPEAKER_06: It's great.
SPEAKER_06: Everyone is really, really glad to obtain such a device.
SPEAKER_06: So you can touch it with your own hands.
SPEAKER_04: Can I?
SPEAKER_06: Sure.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: What do you say?
SPEAKER_04: It says...
SPEAKER_04: I'll say.
SPEAKER_05: Spodgy.
SPEAKER_05: I'll buy it.
SPEAKER_05: One day if I need to.
SPEAKER_05: Hopefully my daughter will like it.
SPEAKER_06: Okay.
SPEAKER_06: And we got the answer.
SPEAKER_06: Yes, of course.
SPEAKER_05: Of course.
SPEAKER_06: Of course.
SPEAKER_06: Please next slide.
SPEAKER_06: This is the prototype you can have a look at it.
SPEAKER_06: And that's all I wanted to say.
SPEAKER_06: Now it's technical specification by our...
SPEAKER_06: Colling.
SPEAKER_03: So there's a button missing.
SPEAKER_03: This is really flexible.
SPEAKER_02: And you're watching the option.
SPEAKER_02: So function.
SPEAKER_02: So as we discussed, we have to switch on, switch off whenever we want.
SPEAKER_02: And so we have buttons.
SPEAKER_02: And using LCD or like you can use this jock wheel and select which option on LCD and then do on and off.
SPEAKER_02: Then you will have volume control.
SPEAKER_02: So you can press this button to increase or decrease your volume.
SPEAKER_02: And we have some LCD controls.
SPEAKER_02: Like switching the LCD display if you want to use LCD or you don't want you can just use normal button.
SPEAKER_02: And we have speech recognition.
SPEAKER_02: Here you have microphone and then it takes your voice and then it's trying to recognize and it converts into the action and location finder.
SPEAKER_02: And we want to do the location basically using speech recognition.
SPEAKER_02: You can just say very smart remote control or you can just give some nickname to your remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Bob is Bob.
SPEAKER_01: Bob.
SPEAKER_01: And Bob.
SPEAKER_01: It would say hi.
SPEAKER_01: Hey Bob.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, hi and then you can use it.
SPEAKER_02: So our team is now fruits mainly strawberry.
SPEAKER_02: So you can have these are strawberries.
SPEAKER_02: And then you can see the look LCD and all the switches.
SPEAKER_00: Colorful.
SPEAKER_02: Material.
SPEAKER_02: We want to stick to Titanium.
SPEAKER_02: And we want roots.
SPEAKER_05: Belly, spark, we tighten.
SPEAKER_05: I didn't know it exists but that's great.
SPEAKER_02: So we want to have simple and perfect shapes.
SPEAKER_02: The cache on this font.
SPEAKER_02: You can have your own designs and you can feel simple designs.
SPEAKER_02: And you can choose colors on your day for each day or even many colors.
SPEAKER_00: That's for the city or for the Titanium.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, for the LCD.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we have Titanium.
SPEAKER_02: Titanium is still working on.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's still working on.
SPEAKER_02: Titanium.
SPEAKER_06: Okay.
SPEAKER_06: We'll start with the LCD.
SPEAKER_06: You can ask Bob.
SPEAKER_06: Yeah.
SPEAKER_06: Just use this.
SPEAKER_01: You have Bob, please.
SPEAKER_01: Hey, you know you've been today.
SPEAKER_01: You've been today.
SPEAKER_01: You've been in big color.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, even you can configure your colors for each day depending on your mood or black.
SPEAKER_02: You can have many colors.
SPEAKER_00: And what are the strawberries for?
SPEAKER_00: These are like sensors.
SPEAKER_02: Of course.
SPEAKER_02: What do you think?
SPEAKER_02: That's what the strawberries are.
SPEAKER_02: That's what the strawberries are.
SPEAKER_02: That's what the strawberries are.
SPEAKER_04: So after this meeting, you'll propose a party for our success for our shooting.
SPEAKER_04: So if you are a vegetarian or you have any options, please let us know.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So after this meeting, you'll propose a party for our success for our shooting.
SPEAKER_02: So if you are a vegetarian or you have any options, please let us know.
SPEAKER_06: Yeah.
SPEAKER_06: And we can just eat some strawberries.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_07: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Anything specific questions?
SPEAKER_00: We'll see the financial party for all the time.
SPEAKER_06: Let's make a party for us to make it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Then we can discuss.
SPEAKER_00: With the five, 50 millions, we first make a party.
SPEAKER_02: Then we can have almost five million left.
SPEAKER_00: What a design.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So.
SPEAKER_00: It's my turn.
SPEAKER_00: Let's see if it meets the evaluation criteria.
SPEAKER_05: If you meet the evaluation criteria.
SPEAKER_07: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So evaluation, please.
SPEAKER_05: So you made a very nice prototype and I think we now need all together to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it.
SPEAKER_05: If it fulfills our what we want to do and things like that.
SPEAKER_05: So next slide, please.
SPEAKER_05: As you know, before going and creating and producing these strawberry remote control, it's very important to first verify if it makes sense, if we have a chance to sell it.
SPEAKER_05: So we need to evaluate it and try to do it in a quantitative way as much as we can.
SPEAKER_05: So what I propose is that we are going to have this scale from 1 to 7, one meaning that yes, it fulfills the criterion, whatever it is, and 7 meaning no, it doesn't fulfill at all.
SPEAKER_05: And we're going to list all the criteria.
SPEAKER_05: I'm going to go to that next slide.
SPEAKER_05: And together try to evaluate this according to this criterion from 1 to 7.
SPEAKER_05: And then we're just going to have an average which will give us the value of our remote control.
SPEAKER_05: So maybe we can have a look at the criteria.
SPEAKER_05: So these are the criteria.
SPEAKER_05: I thought were important.
SPEAKER_05: Of course this can be discussed, but let's see.
SPEAKER_05: So let's suppose we have fancy here and we have this scale from 1 to 7 with 4 in the middle.
SPEAKER_05: So what do you think?
SPEAKER_05: Is it fancy?
SPEAKER_00: I think that fancy we can say it is fancy.
SPEAKER_05: It is very, very fancy or have you ever seen something like that?
SPEAKER_00: I am not the only one who is missing.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, of course.
SPEAKER_05: What do you think?
SPEAKER_05: It feels a bit.
SPEAKER_05: No, wait is later.
SPEAKER_05: No, wait.
SPEAKER_05: Well, the fancy less now.
SPEAKER_05: I think it's quite fancy.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we can do it with 5 or 6.
SPEAKER_05: No, it's 1.
SPEAKER_05: It's another, yes.
SPEAKER_05: One means it's a very fancy, 7 mean no.
SPEAKER_05: So it's 1 or 2, but it's maybe 2.
SPEAKER_05: So here, 2.
SPEAKER_05: Then we have technology.
SPEAKER_05: So what about technology?
SPEAKER_05: We have speech recognition, we have location based.
SPEAKER_05: We have a CD.
SPEAKER_05: Change color.
SPEAKER_05: Change color.
SPEAKER_05: I think it's a one for that.
SPEAKER_05: At least the one, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Rob business.
SPEAKER_02: Till we need to.
SPEAKER_05: So let's suppose my daughter take it and try it away.
SPEAKER_05: Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again?
SPEAKER_05: Maybe not the prototype.
SPEAKER_05: Let's try.
SPEAKER_05: Oh my god.
SPEAKER_05: We just lost one trouble.
SPEAKER_05: No, no.
SPEAKER_06: But it all.
SPEAKER_06: It's still working.
SPEAKER_06: And your daughter got bonus.
SPEAKER_05: It's a strawberry.
SPEAKER_05: So it's not so bad.
SPEAKER_05: I would say 3.
SPEAKER_05: That makes sense, yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Rob is.
SPEAKER_05: Useful.
SPEAKER_05: Well, so the question is, does it have the minimum requirement of a remote control?
SPEAKER_05: I don't know.
SPEAKER_05: These buttons are not clear, but you have at least a little bit of a screen.
SPEAKER_02: Next.
SPEAKER_02: What is the next choice?
SPEAKER_02: This is volume control and channel change.
SPEAKER_00: It depends on the main.
SPEAKER_00: And you can do two sides.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And you can do on LCD using this.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Or scrolling all the option.
SPEAKER_05: So before we go on the LCD, it's not touch control, touch screen.
SPEAKER_05: You cannot go to channel 25.
SPEAKER_00: You can by using the directly.
SPEAKER_06: You go.
SPEAKER_00: So the basic board.
SPEAKER_00: Push here.
SPEAKER_06: So simple. Basic mode is you got just two buttons.
SPEAKER_06: Yeah.
SPEAKER_06: And the drug dial.
SPEAKER_06: Oh, you can check this.
SPEAKER_06: You use this like volume up, volume down.
SPEAKER_06: And if you go to the side.
SPEAKER_06: It's channel up, channel down.
SPEAKER_06: Okay.
SPEAKER_06: And if you want to make just 25, you push on this.
SPEAKER_06: Yeah.
SPEAKER_06: You can select.
SPEAKER_06: You select.
SPEAKER_06: Five.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: It's much longer than tapping to two five.
SPEAKER_05: No, don't you think so?
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: We can't go.
SPEAKER_05: That's it.
SPEAKER_02: You need to press.
SPEAKER_02: Less than five.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: But it's nice because people anyway don't go there.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So what do you think for it?
SPEAKER_05: Useful.
SPEAKER_02: Seems to be useful.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We need address.
SPEAKER_02: We want to be only address two main functions here.
SPEAKER_02: And the other functions will be on LCD.
SPEAKER_00: Let me understand why.
SPEAKER_00: Because I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_00: That's for this one.
SPEAKER_00: This one are two different different.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Up down or left?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And which, what is that?
SPEAKER_06: The digital control.
SPEAKER_06: The digital control in the cursor.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: It's like selection of menus.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Similarly, like you will have blocks and you select which one.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: I would say that the.
SPEAKER_00: No, it looks useful.
SPEAKER_05: Two or three.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Two or three.
SPEAKER_05: Two.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So size and weight.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Is it the effective size and weight that is it real size, real weight?
SPEAKER_05: Or is it sizes on almost sizes going to be that?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Because the weight will be a bit lighter because the state and the.
SPEAKER_06: The 10ium, although it's going to be light.
SPEAKER_05: It's going to be lighter because this seems to be very heavy.
SPEAKER_05: I mean, from a daughter, for instance, yeah.
SPEAKER_05: I'm not sure if she can use it.
SPEAKER_02: But the state should be okay.
SPEAKER_05: I'll put a tree for that because I haven't seen the weight.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: That's not that color and shape.
SPEAKER_05: Well, so color, it seems that we have the several colors for the LCD.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: And it's not very clear what is the color of the.
SPEAKER_05: The case.
SPEAKER_05: The case is still.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, it's going to be tight on your.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_05: That's nice.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's good.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: And what about the strawberries on the top?
SPEAKER_00: Not convinced.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe I'm not fending better.
SPEAKER_05: Well, you know, it's this fruit and vegetable year.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And they're not useful.
SPEAKER_00: So maybe it is.
SPEAKER_05: I think usefulness is, as I just have to remind you, that usefulness is much less important than fanciness.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Whether it's fancy or not, no, we have to decide.
SPEAKER_05: But this.
SPEAKER_00: I would have found more fancy that the fruits are useful.
SPEAKER_05: So that maybe the fruit may be here.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, then it's a bit difficult to use.
SPEAKER_02: We are just giving the fruits for more fanciness and more attraction.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So maybe I think we can have rubber or some sponges, stuff or strawberries and different colors.
SPEAKER_05: So it seems we are even so clear the shape of this.
SPEAKER_00: No, not sure.
SPEAKER_00: Why?
SPEAKER_00: If it was like this.
SPEAKER_02: But it looks really.
SPEAKER_00: It's not really good.
SPEAKER_02: No, it's not fancy anymore.
SPEAKER_02: So these are kind of rubber things, even if you lose one, how can you just put whatever.
SPEAKER_02: Even we can provide many different colors and different fruits.
SPEAKER_02: More or less.
SPEAKER_06: It covers all the angles.
SPEAKER_06: Yeah.
SPEAKER_06: Even if it is, you know, it's very rounded, but still you got some rubber fruit here.
SPEAKER_06: And it's completely, completely secure to leave it with children.
SPEAKER_06: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So you feel like it's something a protection for the remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we have sensors here and so here and here.
SPEAKER_02: Also.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So even if you don't put it works, but this is really fine.
SPEAKER_05: So just the three.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Because everybody doesn't seem to be convinced, although it's quite, you have good arguments.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: And the last one is adaptive.
SPEAKER_05: This is not maybe not as important as the other one.
SPEAKER_05: But can we adapt it to each personal use?
SPEAKER_06: Sure.
SPEAKER_06: Just look at it.
None: Great.
SPEAKER_07: Full adaptable.
SPEAKER_06: Full adaptable.
SPEAKER_07: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: That's it.
SPEAKER_05: So you can fit it to your palm.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: What else can we need?
SPEAKER_05: Do you think you are going to be able to do that with Titanium as well?
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It's for Titanium.
SPEAKER_00: It's for Titanium.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: For Titanium.
SPEAKER_05: If this is, if you're able to do that, then I think it is over one.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Let's go for one.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Now we have to do the average.
SPEAKER_05: Three.
SPEAKER_05: Three.
SPEAKER_05: Three.
SPEAKER_05: Three.
SPEAKER_05: We are good at that.
SPEAKER_05: It's 2.17.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: 2.17.
SPEAKER_05: That's nice.
SPEAKER_05: 2.17.
SPEAKER_05: Out of 7.
SPEAKER_05: I think we have a good thing.
SPEAKER_05: Well, that's all I had to say about Titanium.
SPEAKER_05: So it's a good evaluation.
SPEAKER_05: It seems to be good, yeah.
SPEAKER_05: We have 2.17.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Thanks.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So now it has to fulfill the financial criteria.
SPEAKER_00: So we have a chair.
SPEAKER_00: And it's just a chair.
SPEAKER_05: And it's so, so how many batteries do we need?
SPEAKER_05: One battery.
SPEAKER_00: One battery.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So, two.
SPEAKER_05: Why two?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, this is one of the same.
SPEAKER_04: No.
SPEAKER_04: No.
SPEAKER_04: Never install.
SPEAKER_05: Two batteries are one.
SPEAKER_07: Oh.
SPEAKER_02: No, nobody's one.
SPEAKER_02: We need only one.
SPEAKER_00: Only one.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but the price is two.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, sorry, sorry, sorry.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: You never use the Excel?
SPEAKER_04: No, never.
SPEAKER_04: What's the limit?
SPEAKER_04: It's okay, just I don't know.
SPEAKER_06: It's not my field.
SPEAKER_06: 12 bucks.
SPEAKER_04: 12 bucks.
SPEAKER_04: 12.5.
SPEAKER_04: Check the number also.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, electronics.
SPEAKER_05: We have sample chip.
SPEAKER_05: It's a simple chip.
SPEAKER_02: Simple chip.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: One.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: For buttons.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: For the sample speaker or sensor for speech recognition.
SPEAKER_00: Here.
SPEAKER_00: One also.
SPEAKER_02: What are two?
SPEAKER_05: One.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So, the case.
SPEAKER_05: Which one is it in the end?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think we will go for single.
SPEAKER_02: It's single.
SPEAKER_04: It's flat.
SPEAKER_04: It's flat.
SPEAKER_04: It's flat.
SPEAKER_04: It curved.
SPEAKER_00: I thought you can curve it.
SPEAKER_00: It's flat.
SPEAKER_00: Curveable.
SPEAKER_04: It's curable, but it's not curved.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe there's a superman for that or what.
SPEAKER_04: So, it's only in curve.
SPEAKER_00: I think the price is this one.
SPEAKER_00: This one.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Don't shoot.
SPEAKER_07: We tried.
SPEAKER_07: We tried.
SPEAKER_06: Okay.
SPEAKER_06: So, what is it?
SPEAKER_05: Titanium.
SPEAKER_05: That's expensive.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: The first titanium, I think it's fine.
SPEAKER_00: It's thick.
SPEAKER_00: It's Titan.
SPEAKER_00: Special color?
SPEAKER_00: No.
SPEAKER_05: No, no, no.
SPEAKER_00: No, no.
SPEAKER_00: No, no.
SPEAKER_00: No, no.
SPEAKER_00: No, no.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, sorry.
SPEAKER_00: Again.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Special color.
SPEAKER_02: Oh.
SPEAKER_02: Or it's only on the.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: In LCD display.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But there is no color here.
SPEAKER_02: So, I put it here.
SPEAKER_02: Pushboard on.
SPEAKER_02: So, the LCD.
SPEAKER_00: How many push buttons?
SPEAKER_00: Three or two?
SPEAKER_02: Two.
SPEAKER_02: Two.
SPEAKER_00: Is there the score?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
None: One is active.
SPEAKER_01: One else.
SPEAKER_01: One else.
SPEAKER_01: Display.
SPEAKER_02: That's all.
SPEAKER_00: No, here.
SPEAKER_00: We choose this one and not this one.
None: Oh, I think no.
SPEAKER_00: Is it the scroll wheel and push button?
SPEAKER_04: This is the only scroll wheel.
None: Only scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_00: Only scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So, trying to make sure that you have it.
SPEAKER_00: How do you do to select?
SPEAKER_00: No, but you select with the two.
SPEAKER_05: The other two out.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, you go on the location with your.
SPEAKER_00: Well, and then you.
SPEAKER_00: Then it automatically.
SPEAKER_02: We can just do like if you.
SPEAKER_02: You go.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Oops.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's price is really.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Special colors.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_06: Four buttons.
SPEAKER_06: Yeah.
SPEAKER_07: Buttons and strawberries.
SPEAKER_02: Special form.
SPEAKER_00: You have all of this, no?
SPEAKER_04: She's very hard on this.
SPEAKER_00: Special card.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe not this one with.
SPEAKER_05: No, special material.
SPEAKER_05: We have.
SPEAKER_05: That's for buttons.
SPEAKER_05: But buttons are standard.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, buttons are standard.
SPEAKER_05: It's only buttons.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So.
SPEAKER_05: Nothing special.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So we are at 17.8.
SPEAKER_00: Not special colors.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
SPEAKER_05: No, the color is in the LCD.
SPEAKER_00: And the buttons are not colorized.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: I think the speakers go for.
SPEAKER_02: We can just use this red.
SPEAKER_00: It's already too expensive.
SPEAKER_05: So what is, are we supposed to cut things out now?
SPEAKER_05: Until we get 12.50.
SPEAKER_00: So think of what we can cut here.
SPEAKER_05: Well, if I look at what is the most expensive thing, it's the LCD and the speaker.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Apparently we have to choose one or the other.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_06: Well, as you may know, there are some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical energy.
SPEAKER_06: I mean, producing electricity from mechanical energy.
SPEAKER_06: So the point is that when you take the device and push the button, you produce enough energy.
SPEAKER_00: That you don't need the battery.
SPEAKER_06: Yeah, that you don't need the battery.
SPEAKER_06: So it's something like a hand dynamo, but a real high-tech version of it.
SPEAKER_00: But it's like the hand dynamo.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe the jack wheel can be like that.
SPEAKER_05: So, but if we select the hand dynamo, it's okay.
SPEAKER_05: We only win one.
SPEAKER_05: That's already that.
SPEAKER_06: It's okay.
SPEAKER_00: Let's do that.
SPEAKER_06: Let's do that.
SPEAKER_06: So,
SPEAKER_00: I'm here.
SPEAKER_06: And I propose to, so, about chips, advanced chip on print, right?
SPEAKER_06: So put minus one there, please.
SPEAKER_03: Let's hear this is legal.
SPEAKER_00: Why not?
SPEAKER_00: Let's try.
SPEAKER_06: And then?
SPEAKER_00: Maybe minus three, no?
SPEAKER_02: So, was the result?
SPEAKER_02: Let's have a look.
SPEAKER_02: It's not changing, no?
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_05: You click somewhere, you see if it changes.
SPEAKER_05: Oops.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, it does.
SPEAKER_05: Maybe put minus two, so it looks more reasonable?
