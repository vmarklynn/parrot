SPEAKER_05: So, well, welcome everyone.
SPEAKER_05: As you may have noticed, I created separate folders because it was a little bit busy in our shared project documents folder.
SPEAKER_05: I don't know if everybody put their own documents in the right folder, which is for now the detailed design meeting.
SPEAKER_05: That's newer.
SPEAKER_02: We didn't make any.
SPEAKER_02: We should say that one.
SPEAKER_01: Didn't we just do that?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, safe in the folder.
SPEAKER_02: Safe as...
SPEAKER_05: Oh, no, that's just one big document so you can leave that whatever it is.
SPEAKER_05: Oh.
SPEAKER_05: And we have a...
SPEAKER_05: Okay, I'll turn it off.
SPEAKER_05: Well, not many documents this time.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, yes.
SPEAKER_05: I have it open myself, I guess.
SPEAKER_05: Well, the detailed design meeting.
SPEAKER_05: We're finally getting somewhere.
SPEAKER_05: What are we going to do?
SPEAKER_05: I've opened it already.
SPEAKER_05: I'm still going to take some minutes.
SPEAKER_05: And if I'm right, you two are going to give a product representation.
SPEAKER_05: Where are we going?
SPEAKER_05: Aren't you?
SPEAKER_05: And did you do something with evaluation criteria?
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Good.
SPEAKER_05: We have a correct agenda.
SPEAKER_05: And then we have to look at something which is less nice, the finance aspect, where we can afford what we have designed.
SPEAKER_05: And if we can, we can...
SPEAKER_05: The final part, which is the production or project evaluation, how did we work together and what are the results and how happy are we with those?
SPEAKER_05: Okay, well, finance will be later.
SPEAKER_05: Now I have to give you a word too.
SPEAKER_05: You too.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Get up, Stato.
SPEAKER_02: Hey, Ruz.
SPEAKER_01: We made a prototype.
SPEAKER_01: We first start with the overall...
SPEAKER_01: This is about the total remote control.
SPEAKER_01: We made it green.
SPEAKER_02: Just an example color.
SPEAKER_02: So there's one of the colors we would like to see in our product.
SPEAKER_01: And the screen light blue.
SPEAKER_01: So this is the scroll button and the microphone on the side here under.
SPEAKER_01: And the R&R logo just says R&R now.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Any questions so far?
SPEAKER_02: I think the microphone...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, just an idea about how to...
SPEAKER_00: That's possible.
SPEAKER_02: That's possible.
SPEAKER_02: That's possible.
SPEAKER_02: Well, it's an idea.
SPEAKER_01: Perhaps you should make it a bit big so people know it there.
SPEAKER_00: Do not forget it.
SPEAKER_02: The function, it doesn't really have to be small.
SPEAKER_02: Big, of course.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_02: The microphone could be just a minor hole on the left button.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: We also made some ideas about how the options menu would work.
SPEAKER_02: Using the scroll button on the sides.
SPEAKER_02: Good up.
SPEAKER_01: You push the scroll button.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you push the scroll button.
SPEAKER_01: And it's claps out.
SPEAKER_01: If you press down.
SPEAKER_02: And it drops down menu or a full out menu comes out.
SPEAKER_02: And you get the options becoming available.
SPEAKER_02: For example, TV settings.
SPEAKER_02: Remote settings.
SPEAKER_02: Remote settings, etc.
SPEAKER_02: So you can scroll down to with the scroll button.
SPEAKER_02: As you can see, it's here.
SPEAKER_02: Just push it in.
SPEAKER_02: The menu comes out like this.
SPEAKER_02: And it all becomes visible.
SPEAKER_01: You could also touch it so that it comes out.
SPEAKER_01: And use the scroll being as a...
SPEAKER_01: What you think is...
SPEAKER_01: Indeed.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: It's also nice to see that we made a small menu.
SPEAKER_02: The options menu becoming available when pressing the scroll button.
SPEAKER_02: Any opportunity to use the tail text, which is used, which is still be used.
SPEAKER_02: And we think that it's very handy to put it not under the options menu, but in a separate button.
SPEAKER_02: In a separate button, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's what you should use the teletext sign.
SPEAKER_02: Sign in.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: You can modify that layer.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Should I make any comments about it next time?
SPEAKER_01: Well, this is the total interface of the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_01: The numbers, which is pretty straightforward.
SPEAKER_01: We put an extra button in.
SPEAKER_01: We can erase it.
SPEAKER_01: But it's the button where you can switch channels.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, just when you are on one and you go to two, you go to five.
SPEAKER_01: You can go back to one with that button.
SPEAKER_01: You can just press it.
SPEAKER_01: It has an error.
SPEAKER_01: We put that in.
SPEAKER_01: Thought it would be handy here.
SPEAKER_01: This is the one number, two numbers, better.
SPEAKER_01: Below that, the page and the sound.
SPEAKER_01: And in the middle, the mute.
SPEAKER_01: Battery indicator.
SPEAKER_01: It's quite large.
SPEAKER_01: And this is the on-off button.
SPEAKER_01: Stand by.
SPEAKER_01: Or at least it should look like it.
SPEAKER_01: And the options, the tail text.
SPEAKER_02: You can see clearly now that the tail text and options menu isn't taking much part of the screen.
SPEAKER_02: So it's very...
SPEAKER_02: When you usually doesn't become irritating to see.
SPEAKER_02: Because if you put it on the top, you always get to see the options menu.
SPEAKER_02: Because people regularly read from left to right.
SPEAKER_02: That's it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Well, that's about it.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
None: Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: I will put that on the...
SPEAKER_01: Nice, man.
SPEAKER_05: When I was typing the RR stands for...
SPEAKER_01: That's the logo of the...
SPEAKER_01: It's the...
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Right now it's only RR, isn't it?
SPEAKER_02: Full screen.
SPEAKER_05: I would have recognized it if we were to write collars.
SPEAKER_00: Sorry.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: If you were to write it in the criteria, evaluation.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: My task was this time to put up a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we could...
SPEAKER_04: Requirements from the...of the users.
SPEAKER_04: My name, my job.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: My name.
SPEAKER_04: Method.
SPEAKER_04: Questionnaire with 7 points skill from 1 to 7 from 2 false.
SPEAKER_04: Like a question, is it not big enough?
SPEAKER_04: We can say it's true or false by steps.
SPEAKER_04: One means absolutely not true.
SPEAKER_04: Seven means true.
SPEAKER_04: The three important things of...
SPEAKER_04: You used the PowerPoint.
SPEAKER_04: The format of this year is...
SPEAKER_04: Is the remote control fancy enough?
SPEAKER_04: Is it innovative enough?
SPEAKER_04: And is it easy enough to use?
SPEAKER_04: And then the evaluation itself?
SPEAKER_02: What?
SPEAKER_04: So...
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: First question.
SPEAKER_04: Is the design fancy enough?
SPEAKER_04: Project venture.
SPEAKER_04: What do you think?
SPEAKER_05: Well, it looks fancy.
SPEAKER_04: Actually, with the green color.
SPEAKER_05: And the curves which we decided.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Only what happened to the single curve?
SPEAKER_02: No, the single curve idea was...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: You should make the sideways.
SPEAKER_02: The sideways view.
SPEAKER_01: I guess.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, not that bend.
SPEAKER_00: Not that bend.
SPEAKER_05: Smart word.
SPEAKER_01: Can I draw here?
SPEAKER_02: Sposal.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Something like this from the side.
SPEAKER_01: But with a bit of a curve here, right?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's a single curve indeed.
SPEAKER_01: So if you flip it like this.
SPEAKER_02: Here, it's not very...
SPEAKER_02: It's also very handy if you make a side curve.
SPEAKER_02: Way to make the remote control very thin at the bottom.
SPEAKER_02: At the bottom.
SPEAKER_02: And make it rather thick on the top, because on the top it has the screen, which takes in some space.
SPEAKER_02: And the batteries can be located over there.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: Let's make the back of this part a bit bigger.
SPEAKER_01: So that the place...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it's going to be a little bit heavy at the top.
SPEAKER_02: Let's hope now.
SPEAKER_01: That's a bit of fall on the roof.
SPEAKER_04: With two batteries, the whole grid plate at the top.
SPEAKER_04: And if you were holding it...
SPEAKER_01: I think the batteries should be in here.
SPEAKER_01: Because it's just nothing.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, energy.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, but we have to rate.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, we have to rate.
SPEAKER_04: Is this sign of face enough?
SPEAKER_04: Two?
SPEAKER_04: It's a one.
SPEAKER_04: Four, this is a seven.
SPEAKER_04: So fancy enough means...
SPEAKER_04: Thus, it comes to the younger people and the elderly people.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's pretty fancy.
SPEAKER_01: It doesn't make it green than the older people want.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, you have to green all the colors.
SPEAKER_04: Don't get better than that much now.
SPEAKER_04: It's all designed.
SPEAKER_01: I think it does.
SPEAKER_05: And it does.
SPEAKER_05: I think that's because of the microphone and also the screen.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I don't know whether older people will use it.
SPEAKER_05: It's a new thing.
SPEAKER_05: Well, so...
SPEAKER_01: I will make it a two or something.
SPEAKER_03: A two?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I'd say it.
SPEAKER_03: It's true, it's a one.
SPEAKER_01: All right, it's a one.
SPEAKER_01: Very fancy.
SPEAKER_01: It's a one.
SPEAKER_05: A little bit strange, we have to adjust that ourselves.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I should use that one, but it doesn't.
SPEAKER_01: But it's a one.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, now it's two.
SPEAKER_04: True is a one.
SPEAKER_04: Where is the true is a one?
SPEAKER_04: Where is the true?
SPEAKER_01: Are they pink?
SPEAKER_01: It's very true.
SPEAKER_02: It's very true.
SPEAKER_02: Because we designed it to be very fancy.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but...
SPEAKER_02: It's very fancy, I think.
SPEAKER_02: If you have a scene that's a remote control like this.
SPEAKER_05: No, okay.
SPEAKER_05: No, it's fancy.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, one, two.
SPEAKER_04: Let's give it a two.
SPEAKER_04: Is it innovative?
SPEAKER_01: I think it is.
SPEAKER_01: Because it has an SD-screen, a microphone.
SPEAKER_01: And a server.
SPEAKER_01: It's from Robert.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's a scroll.
SPEAKER_02: It's an after-school screen.
SPEAKER_03: It's the one.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's the one.
None: It's the one, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: True.
SPEAKER_04: Also...
SPEAKER_04: The buttons are easy to find.
SPEAKER_04: That was a big requirement of the old people.
SPEAKER_01: Because they're right on your screen.
SPEAKER_01: So you can use the...
SPEAKER_01: They're right on your screen, so I don't know where you would...
SPEAKER_01: With the ones on the buttons.
SPEAKER_04: It's easy to find.
SPEAKER_04: Not only this button, it's all the buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think they are.
SPEAKER_01: The options are a little bit harder, but if you...
SPEAKER_02: Take the heart out, okay.
SPEAKER_04: Sure.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's easier than the regular remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think this is easy to find.
SPEAKER_04: I think the options buttons are not the easiest way to...
SPEAKER_01: No, they're not, but they're easy to find.
SPEAKER_03: True.
SPEAKER_02: They are a lot easier to find than...
SPEAKER_02: Then on the regular remote controls, where you have to find out what which sign or icon means on the A3 button.
SPEAKER_02: That's true.
SPEAKER_02: So you have to use the manual to understand...
SPEAKER_02: Next.
SPEAKER_05: Which number are we going?
SPEAKER_02: I think it's a two.
SPEAKER_02: At least.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, it's two, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Two, three.
SPEAKER_04: It's not perfect, but I think it's a three.
SPEAKER_02: Three?
SPEAKER_02: And why is that?
SPEAKER_04: Because I don't think...
SPEAKER_04: Maybe it's easy to find right away.
SPEAKER_04: I think if you have the button at the right, I don't think you can find the option button.
SPEAKER_01: But if you want it, you have to use the button at the right.
SPEAKER_01: You can touch it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Instead both the options...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but then you have written option on here, the tail of the text button.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, then I think also to you.
SPEAKER_01: You can touch the option and it comes back.
SPEAKER_02: I do, I do.
SPEAKER_02: The next question.
SPEAKER_02: The next question.
SPEAKER_02: Oh my god.
SPEAKER_05: What about you?
SPEAKER_05: Two, resulting one question.
SPEAKER_05: It's different.
SPEAKER_04: It's easy to use as well for younger elderly people.
SPEAKER_01: For younger people, I think it's easy to use.
SPEAKER_04: Young means 16 to 40 years.
SPEAKER_04: And elderly from 40 years to their death.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's the most useful remote control ever to be manufactured.
SPEAKER_05: Very enthusiastic.
SPEAKER_02: It is obviously easy to use.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, because it has the regular controls, like as you can see on the screen now.
SPEAKER_02: And you don't have all the other options always on your screen.
SPEAKER_02: So as things really easy to use, you want these options to...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, as well as you...
SPEAKER_04: If you're of text, 60 years old, you're holding one of those things in your head.
SPEAKER_01: They don't want the extra options.
SPEAKER_04: No, but we're going to make this for all kinds of people.
SPEAKER_05: And all the ways we could use the speech recognition.
SPEAKER_01: I think it is.
SPEAKER_01: If they read the manual.
SPEAKER_01: Because they're fine.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, perhaps that is one of the most...
SPEAKER_02: Because a lot of youth...
SPEAKER_01: It's not difficult. You say...
SPEAKER_01: Genre 1 and Genre 4.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: To the speech recognition.
SPEAKER_01: Then you say the question and the answer.
SPEAKER_01: And that's everything it does to the speech recognition.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, well maybe that would make it even more easy to use.
SPEAKER_05: I think it would be...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think it does.
SPEAKER_02: So, because all the people who can't...
SPEAKER_02: Make it too.
SPEAKER_04: Also, to...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Another session for this...
SPEAKER_04: I chose 3.
SPEAKER_04: 3?
SPEAKER_04: I would also say 3.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, you have 3, 3, 2, 2, 1.
SPEAKER_05: 2.
SPEAKER_05: So, what are we going to do?
SPEAKER_05: 2 and all.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, 3, I see.
SPEAKER_05: Give me more.
SPEAKER_05: I don't know, question.
SPEAKER_04: We both overwhelmed with buttons.
SPEAKER_04: No.
SPEAKER_04: No.
SPEAKER_04: No.
SPEAKER_04: No, that's...
SPEAKER_01: That's the one.
SPEAKER_01: I think that's the left one.
SPEAKER_01: There's definitely a...
SPEAKER_01: I mean, the 7 is it?
SPEAKER_01: It is.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, the most one.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, but I think you should make it one scale with one thing good.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: It doesn't...
SPEAKER_05: It doesn't be...
SPEAKER_00: It doesn't...
SPEAKER_05: It doesn't sound like...
SPEAKER_02: It doesn't overwhelmed.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: All right.
SPEAKER_04: Designed for you.
SPEAKER_01: Rural...
SPEAKER_01: Through all this colors.
SPEAKER_01: The different...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_05: This will make them in different colors.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, this option.
SPEAKER_05: That's true.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I thought we had about single colors, but you can also make a wood color.
SPEAKER_01: Not just one single color, but the wood.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Like...
SPEAKER_01: Also with the rubber.
SPEAKER_05: I think you've got...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_05: It feels like we're gonna make a print on rubber, can't you?
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But then when you square two is us, come on.
SPEAKER_01: That's the one?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it is harder to...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, many questions.
SPEAKER_04: I have...
SPEAKER_04: Two.
SPEAKER_05: Uh, okay.
SPEAKER_05: Well, we have time.
SPEAKER_05: We're getting paid.
SPEAKER_02: We're getting paid.
SPEAKER_02: We're getting paid.
SPEAKER_04: You're so much cheaper than that.
SPEAKER_04: That's a one, that's rubber.
SPEAKER_04: What can I use to use?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, it's very spun.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I...
SPEAKER_01: Oh, no, it's not very spun.
SPEAKER_01: It's not the most spun-cheese thing.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's a three.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's a three.
SPEAKER_02: Because you want to make it a rather flexible, but not too flexible, because it has an
SPEAKER_00: else-a-E screen. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: How about contrasting hard to lose?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you could...
SPEAKER_04: You could go...
SPEAKER_04: You can lose it if you're 60 years old.
SPEAKER_04: You first, I'll see the thing, you didn't just set the microphone and then you lose it.
SPEAKER_01: Then you have lost it.
SPEAKER_01: You can lose it, but it isn't hard to lose.
SPEAKER_04: It is a dark now.
SPEAKER_04: I think this is a two, personally.
SPEAKER_01: Two.
SPEAKER_01: Is it hard to lose?
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: It isn't hard to lose.
SPEAKER_01: It's a six.
SPEAKER_01: You think?
SPEAKER_03: It isn't hard to lose.
SPEAKER_03: So it's a two.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you can lose it, so I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: You can't lose it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You can't lose it.
SPEAKER_01: It doesn't matter.
SPEAKER_01: You're 60 years old.
SPEAKER_01: You're a hard-to-lose.
SPEAKER_00: A hard-to-lose is good.
SPEAKER_00: No.
SPEAKER_05: The question should be hard to lose.
SPEAKER_05: It's difficult to lose.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, right.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, this is hard to lose.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, so then it is almost true.
SPEAKER_01: So a two.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think also.
SPEAKER_01: Two.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So a two.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think it's hard to lose.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think also.
SPEAKER_02: Two.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Most of it because of the option two.
SPEAKER_01: Whoa.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, it's okay that happened above also.
SPEAKER_05: Maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, no.
SPEAKER_05: Well, it doesn't.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, actually, I remember you put the cursor in another table.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_04: What can though mainly be salt to younger people?
SPEAKER_04: True.
SPEAKER_01: I think it will.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, true.
SPEAKER_04: Very true.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: No, I don't think very true because the colors.
SPEAKER_04: We have the colors.
SPEAKER_04: We have the buttons aren't that much.
SPEAKER_04: Materials.
SPEAKER_04: No, the material isn't that.
SPEAKER_04: It's much more.
SPEAKER_04: So I think it's a three.
SPEAKER_05: Well, I think it's a lower number.
SPEAKER_05: So better because we designed it for young people especially.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but I.
SPEAKER_03: What do you think?
SPEAKER_03: I think it's true.
SPEAKER_02: I think two, two, two, two.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, that's very good.
SPEAKER_05: The features.
SPEAKER_05: The satisfying younger people.
SPEAKER_02: Younger people.
SPEAKER_00: No, perhaps not.
SPEAKER_04: What?
SPEAKER_04: Because younger people are critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing.
SPEAKER_02: Well, not exactly, but if it had some games on it or something like that.
SPEAKER_02: But it's for remote control, I think.
SPEAKER_02: I think the likes these.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, the speech possibility of color.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the screen.
SPEAKER_02: The scroll option.
SPEAKER_04: I think they'll be quite met with their expectations.
SPEAKER_05: Those are more fancy functions, not really many features or something.
SPEAKER_05: I mean, those are features.
SPEAKER_04: There's three features, basically.
SPEAKER_04: LC9, LC9, LC9 touch screen is feature.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: The microphone is feature.
SPEAKER_01: The microphone is feature and that you can change the channel's feature and that you can change the volume of the feature.
SPEAKER_01: And that you can change the options of the remote.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think.
SPEAKER_04: I think then you have the volume up.
SPEAKER_02: The volume up.
SPEAKER_02: The video's a bit different.
SPEAKER_02: Younger people usually use remote control to put on the volume.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Turn on.
SPEAKER_04: I think it's one.
SPEAKER_04: And not feature.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think because you have channel features, you have the screen features, audio features.
SPEAKER_04: You have all buttons on it.
SPEAKER_04: Which would like the microphone extra, LCD screen extra, scroll thing extra.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, you think one, what do you think?
SPEAKER_01: Two or three.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Two.
SPEAKER_05: I'd say three.
SPEAKER_00: Two, make it two.
SPEAKER_00: Make it two.
SPEAKER_00: One, two, three.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, make it two.
SPEAKER_04: You can see the remote controls, the R&R.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, there's R&R in front.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's true.
SPEAKER_01: It's not the colors, maybe you make two, but it has R&R.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah, it did have, now you have the black one.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And we probably make also yellow one.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But not R&R.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, maybe two.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, true, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And the menu that is available is easy to use.
SPEAKER_01: I think it is, but I don't know what you think.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's easy to use than a regular remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Because when you push on the options menu, you get the various options entirely explained, entirely explained.
SPEAKER_02: Instead of just finding out what an icon means on a button.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And you can have it easier.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you can have it with the, you have to push the arrows and with the normal to be remote.
SPEAKER_03: I think that would be quite hard to learn.
SPEAKER_03: You're not satisfied.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, let's start over again.
SPEAKER_02: Let's make it different.
SPEAKER_04: Let's go for menu.
SPEAKER_04: I think it would be a, there too.
SPEAKER_04: Not more.
SPEAKER_04: I see.
SPEAKER_05: We only have two.
SPEAKER_05: That's pretty good.
SPEAKER_05: All right, I think so.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, okay, we have, one three or one that have to cut open.
SPEAKER_03: Two three.
SPEAKER_03: And have to cut open.
SPEAKER_03: Two, two, two, two.
SPEAKER_01: We also have two.
SPEAKER_01: So it's pretty good.
SPEAKER_01: The average is two.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: That average.
SPEAKER_04: Quite good.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: In my opinion, I think so.
SPEAKER_01: We can be happy.
SPEAKER_03: Safe.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: What is it?
SPEAKER_01: It's like a bird.
SPEAKER_01: It's a fly.
SPEAKER_01: A fly.
SPEAKER_01: A butterfly.
SPEAKER_01: Good or fly?
None: That's it.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: That was your evaluation.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_05: Show.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: We don't have to calculate anything because of that.
SPEAKER_05: No, it's two.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Good.
SPEAKER_05: That's two.
SPEAKER_05: Let's see.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, we didn't ask to save.
SPEAKER_05: We didn't want to run you.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I saved it.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Well, the next part might be a little bit difficult to do in a group, but I am willing to try it.
SPEAKER_05: Because we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice excel sheet to do that.
SPEAKER_01: Really, sign.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_05: I'm not sure if I put it in the photo.
SPEAKER_05: I think we are going to calculate the production costs and if they are under or at 12.050, we are good.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: And if we are not, we are going to redesign.
SPEAKER_01: We are going to erase it very quickly.
SPEAKER_05: I think yes.
SPEAKER_05: I don't know.
SPEAKER_05: Do you have the cost or put the excel sheet in the...
SPEAKER_05: Let's hope.
SPEAKER_01: We are going to make a clock.
SPEAKER_05: I think it's still in my own documents folder.
SPEAKER_01: We are going to be around 8 o'clock.
SPEAKER_01: I doubt it.
SPEAKER_01: Perhaps we have got features that don't exist in the excel sheet.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe...
SPEAKER_03: The microphone.
SPEAKER_03: No, it wasn't in my information.
SPEAKER_03: It wasn't too much.
SPEAKER_02: No, but maybe I got...
SPEAKER_02: Of course, the else discrain.
SPEAKER_02: Oh.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Well, this is it.
SPEAKER_05: Maybe I could ask one of you to fill it in so that I can also take minutes.
SPEAKER_05: And maybe the other can use that thing to count numerous functions.
SPEAKER_05: But you shoot the...
SPEAKER_01: Count it.
SPEAKER_05: Like right...
SPEAKER_05: No, we have to count some things and we have to think about some things.
SPEAKER_05: Count it.
SPEAKER_02: You've got to excel to count.
SPEAKER_02: The number of...
SPEAKER_05: No, a count number of functions.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_02: I draw a different screen.
SPEAKER_02: I'll do that because I draw the screen.
SPEAKER_01: We've got a battery.
SPEAKER_01: One is two batteries.
SPEAKER_01: And I want battery.
SPEAKER_01: But two small batteries.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: It's more about the energy source.
SPEAKER_05: Do you use a hand dynamo or battery?
SPEAKER_01: What do you use for solar cell?
SPEAKER_01: Solar cell, no.
SPEAKER_01: No, no, solar cell.
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_01: One battery.
SPEAKER_02: Right?
SPEAKER_02: No hand dynamo.
SPEAKER_02: And...
SPEAKER_01: And it's running simple chip, right?
SPEAKER_04: No, we have simple chip.
SPEAKER_04: An advanced chip.
SPEAKER_04: But we also have simple speaker tools.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So this one...
SPEAKER_01: And this one...
SPEAKER_01: We're already on mine.
SPEAKER_01: Single...
SPEAKER_01: What?
SPEAKER_01: R-E, oh yay.
SPEAKER_04: We have double curved.
SPEAKER_04: Single, nice single curved.
SPEAKER_02: Single curved.
SPEAKER_02: Single curved as...
SPEAKER_02: As you...
SPEAKER_02: Three dimensional.
SPEAKER_02: But it isn't three dimensional.
SPEAKER_02: It isn't curved in...
SPEAKER_01: It's not going to work, right, people.
SPEAKER_01: We have to rubber.
SPEAKER_04: It's going to curved like this, right?
SPEAKER_04: It's curved like this.
SPEAKER_04: No, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_02: Single curved is like this.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_00: It's curved like this.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That's the only curve you made.
SPEAKER_02: Not curved like this.
SPEAKER_02: That's...
SPEAKER_04: Oh, but we have curved like this, isn't it?
SPEAKER_04: The two curved...
SPEAKER_04: 13.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_01: I just said.
SPEAKER_01: What is the scroll wheel, right?
SPEAKER_01: Rubber.
SPEAKER_01: Is it integrated?
SPEAKER_01: No, it's...
SPEAKER_02: Push it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we don't have push.
SPEAKER_02: We got to integrate it's color wheel and push button.
SPEAKER_02: Because when you push it, we want to just pull it in the middle.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah, right.
SPEAKER_01: It's not...
SPEAKER_01: It's not going to work.
SPEAKER_01: It's not going to work.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: We're 15, not too bad.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, um...
SPEAKER_01: Oh, but the special color, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The special form, right?
SPEAKER_02: But now button supplements.
SPEAKER_02: We don't got a button supplement.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, we don't have any buttons.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: 80.5.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, we need to...
SPEAKER_04: We have to lower it with...
SPEAKER_04: Six points.
SPEAKER_04: No, 15.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: 12 and a half.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: We could lose the curve.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: We could use...
SPEAKER_04: I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_02: We could lose the scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_02: We could make just a regular scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: But you can't push it.
SPEAKER_01: So you can't push it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you can't push it.
SPEAKER_02: You have to tap the options we know.
SPEAKER_02: Uh, button here.
SPEAKER_02: And then scroll down with the...
SPEAKER_02: With the button.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think that will work.
SPEAKER_01: So a normal scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, best.
SPEAKER_01: Normal scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: And I think we should...
SPEAKER_04: We'll grab the sample speaker.
SPEAKER_04: It's four...
SPEAKER_04: Four units.
SPEAKER_01: Well, what if you...
SPEAKER_01: It is a new feature.
SPEAKER_01: It's...
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so we don't exactly need to sing.
SPEAKER_02: We don't need a curve.
SPEAKER_02: It's possible to lose that.
SPEAKER_04: It's probably...
SPEAKER_01: Square.
SPEAKER_01: No, then it won't stand up from the table.
SPEAKER_01: Is that...
SPEAKER_01: Is that mean to it?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's meant with...
SPEAKER_02: What's curve?
SPEAKER_02: The curve is in a dimension.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_02: If you make it a flat one, there's no curve.
SPEAKER_02: You got no curve.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but that only...
SPEAKER_04: It's one.
SPEAKER_04: No two.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, a bit.
SPEAKER_04: No one.
SPEAKER_01: Sixty-four.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so we don't...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, we also have to...
SPEAKER_02: Is it possible to make?
SPEAKER_01: Could we do it on a regular chip on print or something?
SPEAKER_04: Otherwise, we don't have a LCD screen.
SPEAKER_01: No, you just can do that.
SPEAKER_05: What did you change?
SPEAKER_05: You changed the...
SPEAKER_05: The scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and the single curve...
SPEAKER_05: Oh, well, that's just one.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, so that doesn't...
SPEAKER_04: Maybe you should...
SPEAKER_04: Scrape a sample speaker.
SPEAKER_02: The sample speaker is...
SPEAKER_04: It's four points.
SPEAKER_04: Yes, four points.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but then you can keep the curve.
SPEAKER_01: It is a new feature.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's a new feature.
SPEAKER_04: When you lose, what else do you want to...
SPEAKER_04: You have to...
SPEAKER_01: We have to...
SPEAKER_01: Four points.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, this is difficult.
SPEAKER_05: Or maybe in a hand, then I'm over.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: You think it would...
SPEAKER_04: Instead of rubber?
SPEAKER_02: No, that's...
SPEAKER_02: When you make a remote control of wood...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it would make a remote control...
SPEAKER_04: It would make a remote control of wood.
SPEAKER_04: You can make a tape show, we said it rubber.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, it all stays one point less.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, but a wood and remote control only helps for...
SPEAKER_01: Oh, can I ask some people...
SPEAKER_01: What is special color?
SPEAKER_01: Is that the wood...
SPEAKER_05: I think it is.
SPEAKER_05: It needs to have that one too.
SPEAKER_05: But I think the only option is to...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: To knock the sample speaker in...
SPEAKER_01: And a sample sensor.
SPEAKER_04: Then we still have too much.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay, three points.
SPEAKER_02: Of course, but...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we...
SPEAKER_00: Watch 12.5.
SPEAKER_02: What?
SPEAKER_02: That's making 13 or 14.
SPEAKER_02: We need 12.5.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we need...
SPEAKER_01: Three.
SPEAKER_01: We need 0.3.
SPEAKER_04: That's the scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: It's a color.
SPEAKER_01: Don't make a food.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but the wood...
SPEAKER_04: We can make it brown, dark brown, not the wood.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but is it special color?
SPEAKER_01: Is it...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, color?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, color?
SPEAKER_01: It's also green or...?
SPEAKER_04: No, that's just a normal color.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but it's just a color than just rubber color.
SPEAKER_01: You have to add something to the rubber to make it green.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You don't say here, it's green rubber.
SPEAKER_00: They don't tell green rubber.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think you can...
SPEAKER_04: Every way...
SPEAKER_04: Two or 12.5.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you can.
SPEAKER_01: You have to...
SPEAKER_04: Well, then we have to scrap LCD display.
SPEAKER_04: We have to scrap...
SPEAKER_04: No, it's the most...
SPEAKER_04:...I guess.
SPEAKER_04: Then we have to scrap everything.
SPEAKER_04: Because how many colors we're going to make?
SPEAKER_04: Five.
SPEAKER_02: If we lose the scroll wheel...
SPEAKER_02:...and make it totally depending...
SPEAKER_02:...depended on the touchscreen...
SPEAKER_02:...then it's possible to make...
SPEAKER_02:...and then you can add two colors.
SPEAKER_02: And then you can add the colors.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, two colors, of course.
SPEAKER_02: We did...
SPEAKER_02:...special...
SPEAKER_02: If you lose...
SPEAKER_02:...if you lose the...
SPEAKER_01: It's not such a great idea.
SPEAKER_02: You do it this way.
SPEAKER_02: And you get a level of 0.5.
SPEAKER_02: And then you can make...
SPEAKER_02:...a special single curve, for example.
SPEAKER_04: And then you have two colors.
SPEAKER_04: The colors, like she told...
SPEAKER_04:...is that all the colors we add...
SPEAKER_02:...or...
SPEAKER_02:...anyway, colors.
SPEAKER_02: Special colors, all the colors you want...
SPEAKER_04:...because we have yellow, red, black...
SPEAKER_02:...when you use more than one color, it's a special color.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: But I think when you use the color that's not originally the rubber...
SPEAKER_01:...then you use special color.
SPEAKER_04: But the rubber is also original black.
SPEAKER_01: You could make it always black.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but we're going to make it yellow, red...
SPEAKER_04:...and then you add...
SPEAKER_04:...you have two special colors on top of the one.
SPEAKER_02: We also want to make another color.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we have to make this like four or five or something.
SPEAKER_04: Because we have more colors than only black.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but it isn't it.
SPEAKER_04: I don't think they made me special.
SPEAKER_01: Right, is it very remote?
SPEAKER_05: I think it made half-per-remote.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's right.
SPEAKER_01: And you want one color, for every remote.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and then it is one.
SPEAKER_02: You don't need four of those.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, for those special colors, you want to choose one remote.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: We have two points spare.
SPEAKER_04: So the one point.
SPEAKER_05: We have an advanced chip on print.
SPEAKER_01: So it would be curved, single curved.
SPEAKER_01: Because of...
SPEAKER_05: Or not.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, well you can at least make it curved again.
SPEAKER_01: Very single curved.
SPEAKER_01: You can make a nice remote.
SPEAKER_05: Because that was very important.
SPEAKER_01: Too bad for the speaker.
SPEAKER_05: So it's curved, so we dropped the speech recognition.
SPEAKER_05: Should we change that speaker?
SPEAKER_01: That's a one or not.
SPEAKER_05: We dropped the scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: Could you copy it?
SPEAKER_01: And the rest is the same, huh?
SPEAKER_04: The scroll wheel is locked.
SPEAKER_01: The entire...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Actually, I think copy page of the song.
SPEAKER_01: Oh.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, you made the entire...
SPEAKER_01: And do...
SPEAKER_02: And do...
SPEAKER_02: And do.
SPEAKER_00: No, not one more time.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, let me make it.
SPEAKER_01: Two.
SPEAKER_01: Perhaps you can say this one.
SPEAKER_01: Now copy page.
SPEAKER_01: And copy page.
SPEAKER_01: Left off.
SPEAKER_01: No, but you...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Something I don't know.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, but this new remote we can't afford.
SPEAKER_01: Let's forget.
SPEAKER_01: It should have worked.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so you had this list as start?
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: I guess you received it.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: It works so hard at the final department.
SPEAKER_02: Well, suppose this is...
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so we lose the scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The microphone.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, and that's it.
SPEAKER_05: And the microphone.
SPEAKER_01: And we changed something, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not...
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: That's 12, you have 50.
SPEAKER_05: And did you try to make a new design?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I tried to copy that one, but it didn't work.
SPEAKER_01: It didn't work.
SPEAKER_01: So we could fix it like this.
SPEAKER_01: You could select it all.
SPEAKER_01: That's why you can erase.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, you can't erase?
SPEAKER_01: Erase.
SPEAKER_01: When you...
SPEAKER_01: Earlier when we selected it, I don't erase anything.
SPEAKER_05: I can't even just say copy.
SPEAKER_05: Blink, new page.
SPEAKER_05: Based.
SPEAKER_05: Ah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Select none.
SPEAKER_05: Just tap somewhere.
SPEAKER_02: Just tap somewhere.
SPEAKER_02: Just tap somewhere.
SPEAKER_02: You're excited.
SPEAKER_05: Right.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: And now you can erase.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think I can.
SPEAKER_01: I can try.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, no.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, you can draw off it with white.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we tried it earlier.
SPEAKER_01: It's very much work.
SPEAKER_05: Sorry.
SPEAKER_05: Well, but that's also useful for the evaluation.
SPEAKER_05: Because I think we have a prototype now, which we can afford.
SPEAKER_05: And we only need to draw a little bit to get a good design.
SPEAKER_05: Doodle.
SPEAKER_05: And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation, because of the time.
SPEAKER_04: And erase the mic.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, goodbye, Mike.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I need his no mic.
SPEAKER_01: So I erased half of the mic.
SPEAKER_05: See this?
SPEAKER_02: Push it on.
SPEAKER_05: I'll move back to here.
SPEAKER_01: Too bad, oh.
None: Blah.
SPEAKER_04: Hmm.
SPEAKER_01: Like this.
SPEAKER_01: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: Still looks nice.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, great.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, thank you.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, looks like iPod.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, no, Mick.
SPEAKER_05: No.
SPEAKER_05: Hey, how can you erase that?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, this is a bit weird.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, it's not really nice.
SPEAKER_02: The difference between lines and text and pen.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, all I need is more mic.
SPEAKER_05: You can't erase this.
SPEAKER_05: No.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, let's just leave it at this.
SPEAKER_05: And we should be safe.
SPEAKER_05: And then we are going to the project or product evaluation.
SPEAKER_05: We just did.
SPEAKER_05: Now project evaluation.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, I think I can sit for that.
SPEAKER_05: Almost my final slide.
SPEAKER_05: What did you think about the process?
SPEAKER_05: How satisfied are we?
SPEAKER_02: The headlines are sometimes are short.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's stressful.
SPEAKER_04: I think it should be better if we worked a little bit together.
SPEAKER_04: Now we worked through each other.
SPEAKER_04: And you could ask him.
SPEAKER_04: And you had information I didn't have.
SPEAKER_04: And you had information I also had.
SPEAKER_04: Oh.
SPEAKER_04: Some things I had in my presentation.
SPEAKER_04: They already told so.
SPEAKER_05: And for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present.
SPEAKER_05: What?
SPEAKER_04: So yeah, I don't think that is the best way to work.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, for so you would say communicate during our individual.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, and maybe a session of five minutes together or something and then work.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but why not work here together?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: For example, why should we be separated from each other?
SPEAKER_02: And there's different, different rooms.
SPEAKER_05: Probably to simulate the whole working process.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, you can work together too.
SPEAKER_05: You can't have a meeting.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: It's a lot of work.
SPEAKER_04: Then you can work together too by mail or by chat.
SPEAKER_04: Something.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, we are completely separated from each other.
SPEAKER_04: I don't think that was the best way.
SPEAKER_02: But the technology was fantastic.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the technology was really good.
SPEAKER_01: I don't really like that board.
SPEAKER_01: It doesn't really work.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'll give I don't think that.
SPEAKER_04: Sometimes it's a big thing.
SPEAKER_04: I think that's what it does work.
SPEAKER_01: It does work, but sometimes it doesn't do race or it doesn't.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, perhaps it is easy to get one of those digital pens or so and two and lay it next to that keyboard over there.
SPEAKER_02: So you can draw it and see it on the screen or something.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So you don't think the smart board is really useful.
SPEAKER_01: But it doesn't really work all the time.
SPEAKER_02: So when you put a pen on the screen, for example, the line is being drawn two or three centimeters below.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, so it's maybe a bit natural.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, right.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you can point where you want the line to be.
SPEAKER_01: But.
SPEAKER_02: The project because of the deadlines you didn't have time to have you didn't have time to make a very qualitative presentation.
SPEAKER_02: So you used the different PowerPoint presentations in which you put your material on.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, that wasn't me.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, that wasn't me.
SPEAKER_05: So the means we discussed the smart board and what about this digital pen?
SPEAKER_01: I didn't use it at all.
SPEAKER_01: I used it.
SPEAKER_01: So you can use it as a project.
SPEAKER_05: I used it as a normal pen and only you used it to get it on the computer.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it did work.
SPEAKER_02: I used it too.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think why you want to use it.
SPEAKER_01: But it does work.
SPEAKER_04: So make some designs that's very easy to design something and then loyalty to your computer.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, you can show it to them.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's a right idea.
SPEAKER_01: It doesn't really matter.
SPEAKER_02: But the big to write.
SPEAKER_02: It's too big, it's too fat.
SPEAKER_02: Fat document does.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: And what about the teamwork?
SPEAKER_03: I think it was great.
SPEAKER_03: I think so too.
SPEAKER_03: The only thing that we work through post-itual or something, that's the only problem.
SPEAKER_04: But it was hard assignment.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, and maybe I should work out of the room when you discuss this point.
SPEAKER_01: I thought it was good.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, no problem.
SPEAKER_02: Not too much, not too too.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: And creativity?
SPEAKER_05: Well, when we look at this, I'd say.
SPEAKER_05: It's been creative.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the room for...
SPEAKER_02: There was the idea to be creative.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You got some standard ideas in your head.
SPEAKER_01: And this is what came out.
SPEAKER_01: You get stuff from the...
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The information was sometimes...
SPEAKER_02: A little bit too late or too late.
SPEAKER_04: You just said that for that middle.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I played, I think, seven times solitary or something.
SPEAKER_04: Wow, I didn't know it was time.
SPEAKER_01: Is it on there?
SPEAKER_01: It's on there.
SPEAKER_01: I didn't find that.
SPEAKER_01: That's something.
SPEAKER_01: I'm so excited.
SPEAKER_05: It's like five emails at one moment.
SPEAKER_04: No, I never got that.
SPEAKER_05: I've never liked one email after 10 minutes or something.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, I even got spam.
SPEAKER_05: Or something like that.
SPEAKER_04: That's what we said.
SPEAKER_04: And the information was a bit low, I think.
SPEAKER_04: In the beginning, I didn't understand what to do.
SPEAKER_04: No, the first time.
SPEAKER_04: I didn't know.
SPEAKER_04: With the remote crew, I definitely knew we had to...
SPEAKER_04: We made a remote control.
SPEAKER_01: And I didn't know what to do for the first 10 minutes before we got here.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We were stepping on the table and looking at the internet.
SPEAKER_02: Looking at the screen.
SPEAKER_02: I'm working on working on one.
SPEAKER_05: Rrrrr.
SPEAKER_05: Nope.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, well.
SPEAKER_05: But after all we can say, we are satisfied.
SPEAKER_05: But it's been better when we get...
SPEAKER_05: When we've got more information.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That will be handy.

SPEAKER_02: It's first point, but it was possible.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: All the controls were used.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So actually you could make an LCD screen, but no mic, or it could make mic, but no, it was this.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: A little bit mean to put it in the...
SPEAKER_05: And what we had other points to improve this whole process.
SPEAKER_00: Rrrrr.

SPEAKER_04: They were just fine.
SPEAKER_04: The network was okay.
SPEAKER_04: When you load it was also...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, everything was there.
SPEAKER_05: And some more time might have improved the quantity of work.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but now half past four, half past three.
SPEAKER_01: And a bit is just the half hours between the two work alone.

SPEAKER_05: I guess my last slide.
SPEAKER_05: Yes.
SPEAKER_05: Which is the closing?
SPEAKER_05: Well, we managed to...
SPEAKER_05: But we did that very quickly.
SPEAKER_05: I don't know if that's the best way to...
SPEAKER_05: When it is too expensive to quickly rearrange it and say,
SPEAKER_00: Okay, this is it.
SPEAKER_05: But we had to do it. Because we have to have a design.
SPEAKER_05: And that is within the budget.
SPEAKER_05: And we evaluated.
SPEAKER_05: Maybe we should re-evaluate the product.
SPEAKER_05: But we did that before.
SPEAKER_05: And we also evaluated the project.
SPEAKER_05: And I think everybody is very happy at least.
SPEAKER_05: I am with the result.

SPEAKER_01: I think we have to fill in a questionnaire again.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, I think we also have to go to our own rooms again.
SPEAKER_05: But, well, I at least.
SPEAKER_05: But maybe you can try to make a screenshot of this.
SPEAKER_05: So, I can try to include it in the final report.
SPEAKER_05: That one?
SPEAKER_02: You can't...
SPEAKER_01: You can't escape it, maybe.
