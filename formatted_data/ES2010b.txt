None: I'm going to go.
SPEAKER_01: Was the questioner supposed to be filled in before after the winter?
SPEAKER_03: We just got a third one. Do you want us to do it really fast?
SPEAKER_03: Or wait.
None: Okay.
None: Oh yeah, that was quick.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: There we go.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Welcome to our second meeting.
SPEAKER_03: This is the functional design meeting.
SPEAKER_03: And I hope you all had a good individual working time.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. Let's get started.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. Here's the agenda for the meeting.
SPEAKER_03: After the opening, I am going to fulfill the role of secretary.
SPEAKER_03: Take the meeting minutes.
SPEAKER_03: Then we're going to have three presentations, one from each of you.
SPEAKER_03: Then we're going to discuss some new project requirements.
SPEAKER_03: Going to come to decision on the functions of their remote control.
SPEAKER_03: And then we're going to close up the meeting.
SPEAKER_03: And we're going to do this on about 40 minutes.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: First, I want to discuss the goals of this meeting.
SPEAKER_03: First, we need to determine the user requirements.
SPEAKER_03: And the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control.
SPEAKER_03: And then we're going to determine the technical functions.
SPEAKER_03: What is the effect of the apparatus?
SPEAKER_03: What actually is it supposed to do?
SPEAKER_03: What do people pick up a remote and use it for?
SPEAKER_03: And then lastly, we're going to determine its working design.
SPEAKER_03: How exactly will it perform its functions?
SPEAKER_03: That's the whole technical side of.
SPEAKER_03: I'll just give you a minute because it looks like you're making some notes.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Oh.
SPEAKER_03: Well, let's go ahead and...
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to click.
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to click.
SPEAKER_03: So what I want to do right now is hear from all three of you on your research that you just did.
SPEAKER_03: Who would like to start us off?
SPEAKER_01: I don't like going first.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Do you have a PowerPoint or no?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it should be in the...
SPEAKER_01: Do you want to do our PowerPoints now?
SPEAKER_01: You can do it yourself actually.
SPEAKER_04: Oh.
SPEAKER_04: Did you send it?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
None: Okay.
None: Mm-hmm.
None: Mm-hmm.
None: This one?
None: Sure.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Great.
SPEAKER_04: Well, the function of a remote control as...
SPEAKER_01: We've been informed is basically to send messages to the television side.
SPEAKER_01: For example, switch it on.
SPEAKER_01: Switch it off.
SPEAKER_01: Go to this channel.
SPEAKER_01: Go to channel nine.
None: Turn the volume up, etc.
SPEAKER_01: Some of the considerations is just...
SPEAKER_01: For example, what it needs to include is the numbers.
SPEAKER_01: There are zero to nine, so you can move to channel.
SPEAKER_01: The power button on, slash off.
SPEAKER_01: The channel going up and down.
SPEAKER_01: Volume going up and down.
SPEAKER_01: And then mute.
SPEAKER_01: And then, functions for VHS DVD.
SPEAKER_01: For example, play rewind fast-forward stop-pause.
SPEAKER_01: Enter.
SPEAKER_01: And enter would be for like, you know, the menus.
SPEAKER_01: And then, other menus for DVD as well as TV.
SPEAKER_01: Whether that means like, we can go and decide the brightness of the screen.
SPEAKER_01: Things like that.
SPEAKER_01: All the more complicated functions with menus.
SPEAKER_01: And we can decide if that's what we want in it.
SPEAKER_01: If we want to include that in the remote or if that's something that would stay on the TV itself, for example.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: These are two examples.
SPEAKER_01: And you can see on the left, it's got a lot more buttons.
SPEAKER_01: And I don't know if you can read it, but it says, step.
SPEAKER_01: So, to freeze, slow, repeat, program, mute.
SPEAKER_01: And so, there's some of the buttons.
SPEAKER_01: And so, you see an idea.
SPEAKER_01: One example.
SPEAKER_01: And then, on the right, it's a lot more simpler.
SPEAKER_01: It's got volume.
SPEAKER_01: It's got the play, like circle set, which is play rewind.
SPEAKER_01: But it's also, what is fast forward is also like next on a menu.
SPEAKER_01: So, you have functions that are duplicating.
SPEAKER_01: And you have a mute button in the numbers, and the adact in the power button.
SPEAKER_01: So, that gives you two different kinds of more complex and more simple version.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Ready?
SPEAKER_01: And then, lastly, it's just the questions that we want to consider.
SPEAKER_01: Like, what functions do we want it to include and how simple complex it should be?
SPEAKER_01: And what functions it needs to complete?
SPEAKER_01: What I needed to complete the installation process, because, you know, it also has to be considered, and it's going to be, hopefully, one time thing.
SPEAKER_01: When you set it up, it should be set to go.
SPEAKER_01: But we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up in the first place.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so that's it.
SPEAKER_03: All right.
SPEAKER_03: Very good presentation.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: I speak with such authority on the menu.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Who would like to follow that one up?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that we just go.
SPEAKER_03: I think so.
SPEAKER_03: Do you want me to run it or do you want me to run it?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you should run it.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: You do.
SPEAKER_03: Functional requirements?
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: All right.
SPEAKER_03: Now, we have Courtney with the Functional requirements.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So, we tested 100 subjects in our lab, and we just, we watched them, and we also made them fill out a questionnaire, and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls.
SPEAKER_02: 75% think they're ugly, 80%.
SPEAKER_02: What they are willing to spend more, which is good news for us, if we make it look fancier.
SPEAKER_02: And basically, we just need something that really, I mean, there's some other points of there.
SPEAKER_02: But they, it needs to be schnazzy, but yet simple.
SPEAKER_02: So, that's really what we need to do.
SPEAKER_02: And we need, we need it to be simple, yet it needs to be high-tech looking.
SPEAKER_02: So, like, they, like, I guess, use the buttons a lot.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: It's from my research.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Why team wasn't very clear.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, sorry.
SPEAKER_03: What do you mean by the current remote controls not match well, the operating behavior of the user?
SPEAKER_02: I think it's like the engineering versus user.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Whereas, like, the engineering, she showed that the engineering ones are more complex.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: And users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained over there.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Because they only use 10% of the buttons, really.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: They only use 10% of their brains.
SPEAKER_04: Good points.
SPEAKER_02: It works.
SPEAKER_02: It's a necessary people.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Ready for the next slide.
SPEAKER_02: And so, people say that they typically lose it as you yourself know, because you probably lose your remote control all the time, much like any small, small, or even like a cell phone.
SPEAKER_02: And they, we need something simple, because most people, well, 34% say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one.
SPEAKER_02: And we don't want to go.
SPEAKER_02: We don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, they do need to be able to identify it.
SPEAKER_02: And RSI, I'm not very sure what that is.
SPEAKER_02: It's important for the remote control world.
SPEAKER_01: Organomics like your hand movement, so should I?
SPEAKER_02: Could be.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Possibly.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe really needs to provide more information on what RSI is.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's what my website said.
SPEAKER_03: I think that's a pretty good guess, though.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I would assume so.
SPEAKER_02: I think we're supposed to know as remote control experts.
SPEAKER_02: But also, so the channel, the volume, and the power buttons are the most important.
SPEAKER_02: On our company website, you can find, like the specific statistics concerning how much each button is used.
SPEAKER_02: But those are the, definitely the top ones.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Next slide.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: And so, personally, I think that we need a modern eye catching design, but it really needs to be simple.
SPEAKER_02: So, saying from your site, your presentation, the engineering versus the user specified remote.
SPEAKER_02: I think that we should go with something that's more user friendly.
SPEAKER_02: Where the engineering ones, the boxes tend to make it look more complicated than it really is.
SPEAKER_02: The functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons we really need on it.
SPEAKER_02: And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers.
SPEAKER_02: So, even though we need a small number of buttons, we also need to take in like our most people going to be using it for a DVD player or a TVO.
SPEAKER_02: What exactly are we using it for as well as the age range.
SPEAKER_02: So, we need a hip, but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product.
SPEAKER_02: And also, we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up and coming thing.
SPEAKER_02: They really, consumers are really interested in it.
SPEAKER_02: And since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for our remote, for it to be more high class.
SPEAKER_02: And so, just consider it.
SPEAKER_03: Just to clarify by speech recognition, you mean they would say channel five and the thing would go.
SPEAKER_03: I guess so.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I have to just say where are you?
SPEAKER_01: I think the beach, you know?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I guess we can interpret it.
SPEAKER_02: Like, we can just try out different types of speech recognition.
SPEAKER_03: Didn't our rival company's manufacturer remote that you would press the button on the TV and it would remote would beep so that if you ever lost it.
SPEAKER_03: It's a lot of remote phone you should have.
SPEAKER_03: Oh yeah, that's true.
SPEAKER_03: You could definitely include that if we wanted to.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: If it's within our rice.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I'm ready for our last presentation.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I'm just trying to move it.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, I think it should be there.
SPEAKER_04: Working design.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: I didn't get a chance to complete this one.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so, I think it's a little bit more interesting because some of the tools that I was given were frustrating.
SPEAKER_04: That was fun.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so method method of our design.
SPEAKER_04: I think I just started listing some of the things that we actually need to put into this.
SPEAKER_04: We need a power source.
SPEAKER_04: We're going to need a smart chip if we're going to make it multifunctional.
SPEAKER_04: Extra functions will probably need an additional chip.
SPEAKER_04: Either that or this smart chip will have to be extremely smart.
SPEAKER_02: What exactly is a smart chip?
SPEAKER_04: Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions.
SPEAKER_01: Well, how much extra would the additional chip be?
SPEAKER_01: Is that going to push us over our production costs?
SPEAKER_04: I wouldn't think so because we could probably get it from like a bulk from a newer company.
SPEAKER_04: They tend to sell their chips pretty cheap.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Ready?
SPEAKER_04: Yep.
SPEAKER_04: Nothing here.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Power source.
SPEAKER_04: I figured batteries because they're easily available.
SPEAKER_04: Typically remote has either two double A's or four triple A's.
SPEAKER_04: Sometimes three.
SPEAKER_04: Really kind of depends on the size of the actual remote itself.
SPEAKER_04: A large on-off button.
SPEAKER_04: Demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people.
SPEAKER_04: So a large on-off button would probably be good.
SPEAKER_04: The selection button for various entertainment devices.
SPEAKER_04: So you want something that will permit you to select the DVD player or the TV or the stereo system.
SPEAKER_04: Smart chip that permits, sorry, universal application.
SPEAKER_04: Again, something that will allow us to skip over between devices.
SPEAKER_04: That's kind of it.
SPEAKER_04: This is my 52nd design.
SPEAKER_04: Power source over here.
SPEAKER_04: We're going to have a switch, obviously, between the power source and the rest of it.
SPEAKER_04: You're going to need the switch.
SPEAKER_04: Extra bulb could just be for flashiness.
SPEAKER_04: Subcomponent, which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the device.
SPEAKER_04: The chip and, of course, the infrared bulb.
SPEAKER_04: So it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to.
SPEAKER_02: So what exactly are we looking at?
SPEAKER_04: This is just like a rough schematic.
SPEAKER_03: So this is the internal workings.
SPEAKER_03: So the red would be the front of the remote, though.
SPEAKER_01: That's going to be what's communicating with the TV, but the other bulb is good.
SPEAKER_01: Just to indicate I'm doing something sort of like a...
SPEAKER_04: We don't have to stare at that infrared because when the battery starts dying on your remote, you have to actually stare at that bulb and go, okay, when I push this button, is it working?
SPEAKER_04: It probably might skip that whole thing, right?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, so you can put it in the dark.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, that's good.
SPEAKER_03: We should take a little bit dark.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, definitely.
SPEAKER_03: Hey, next.
SPEAKER_03: Ready?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's it.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Anything you want to add for personal preferences, though?
SPEAKER_03: You said already that we need a large enough button, you think.
SPEAKER_04: I think that's a good idea because that's one of the most important buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Well, should it be larger buttons in general?
SPEAKER_01: You know, like the examples that I had there are quite small, so should we try and go for something that has larger buttons?
SPEAKER_02: I think we should.
SPEAKER_02: I think that would be in for the design, sorry.
SPEAKER_02: I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like normal remote, because most remote have small square buttons.
SPEAKER_02: I think we should do something like bigger and round.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, almost.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, let's talk about all of our...
SPEAKER_03: We'll come to a decision later about all the components that we need to include.
SPEAKER_03: Let's wrap up this one, and I'm going to go back to my PowerPoint, because we need to discuss the new project requirements, which you might have already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier.
SPEAKER_03: Wait.
SPEAKER_03: Come back.
SPEAKER_03: All right.
SPEAKER_03: Sorry.
SPEAKER_03: Let's go through this.
SPEAKER_03: All right.
SPEAKER_03: New product requirements.
SPEAKER_03: First, it's only going to be a TV remote.
SPEAKER_03: We're trying not to over-complicate things.
SPEAKER_03: So no DVD, no TV, no stereo.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: It's not going to be multifunctional.
SPEAKER_03: Hey.
SPEAKER_03: And we need to promote our company more.
SPEAKER_03: So we need to somehow include our color and our company slogan on the remote.
SPEAKER_03: We're trying to get our name out there in the world.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And you know what teletext is?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. In the States, we don't have it.
SPEAKER_03: But it's like they just have this channel where it just has news and weather kind of sports.
SPEAKER_03: It's very bland looking.
SPEAKER_03: It's just text on the screen.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Not even black with writing along the bottom.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: You can also get the TV guide.
SPEAKER_02: Wait.
SPEAKER_02: Is it like the weather channel where it's got the ticker running on the bottom?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: It seems like the entire screen is just running information at random.
SPEAKER_01: So anyway, it's more like you can pick the news, you can entertain them.
SPEAKER_03: So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But it's becoming outdated now because of the internet.
SPEAKER_03: Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news.
SPEAKER_03: And we have 24 hour news channels now too.
SPEAKER_03: So those are our new product requirements.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So do we have to include the company color within that?
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Let's try the logo.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Somebody color being yellow.
SPEAKER_03: What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions definitive that we can all agree on about the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do.
SPEAKER_03: And then we'll close up the meeting.
SPEAKER_03: So.
SPEAKER_03: All right.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So our target group is you mentioned older people.
SPEAKER_03: Would it just be universal for everyone, you think, because I think even if something has large buttons.
SPEAKER_03: As long as they're not childishly large, like even technically non-technically challenged people are going to use it.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, they want something user friendly.
SPEAKER_04: Well, even if we kept the regular standard size of remote, if we reduce the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra.
SPEAKER_04: Is they're saying they only use 10% of them.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: For target group, would we say, I mean, young and old, all age ranges, all not kids, obviously, right?
SPEAKER_02: No, kids need to know how to use remote.
SPEAKER_02: Most of them willing to.
SPEAKER_02: They've got a chance between Disney Channel and Cartoon Network.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So we're going to go anywhere.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think we need to adult in the age range.
SPEAKER_03: What about technical specifications, like how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote?
SPEAKER_02: I would say we should say, dumber than the average person.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Go for the lowest denominator.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So they need no technical experience to operate.
SPEAKER_04: How about little to know, because there's no way that you're going to be able to make it.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And we also need to determine the specific functions of this, just to get it all out on paper.
SPEAKER_03: So we said it needs to send messages to the TV, needs to change the channel, turn on and off, just basic simple stuff like this.
SPEAKER_03: So if you have something, just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes.
SPEAKER_01: Most channel, on off button volume, volume and channel.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Those are the most important ones.
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_03: And we want to keep, I'll make a note here that we want to keep the number of buttons down.
SPEAKER_03: Correct.
SPEAKER_03: Because people only use 10%.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Hey, what else?
SPEAKER_04: Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily?
SPEAKER_03: I think so.
SPEAKER_03: What do you?
SPEAKER_01: Sure.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So what?
SPEAKER_04: I think we need to, like if this is going to get lost underneath the couch, how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it?
SPEAKER_02: Because people really are looking for our methods, more high tech.
SPEAKER_04: What if we gave it a charger?
SPEAKER_04: And on the charger, just like a phone, like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger and a phone.
SPEAKER_04: Leave your phone somewhere.
SPEAKER_04: You push the button to find it.
SPEAKER_04: And it finds the phone really goes for that though.
SPEAKER_04: Because it's useful for the remote phone.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Would that add to our cost at all?
SPEAKER_02: I wonder.
SPEAKER_02: I would think so because you'd have to develop a base.
SPEAKER_01: Well, if you have a base, you can start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I think we can make a decision about that later.
SPEAKER_03: Well, still put that as a point that we need to discuss.
None: So that would include battery source.
SPEAKER_03: Power source rather.
SPEAKER_03: Is it going to have a charger?
SPEAKER_03: Or is it going to be run strictly out of batteries?
SPEAKER_03: And we also need to deal with the issue that you mentioned of speech recognition.
SPEAKER_03: If we want.
SPEAKER_01: If we have a speech recognition, then we can start aiming at it.
SPEAKER_01: Like another kind of more handicapped disabled demographic.
SPEAKER_02: Well, there's the people who desire speech recognition.
SPEAKER_02: There's the different demographics have different desires.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if you guys can.
SPEAKER_02: You could, it wouldn't copy onto the things it's black.
SPEAKER_02: But all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition.
SPEAKER_02: So basically older people don't really care.
SPEAKER_02: It's really the people 25 to 35.
SPEAKER_02: I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of TV though.
SPEAKER_02: They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas.
SPEAKER_02: And if it comes.
SPEAKER_03: And if we introduce it when they're at this age, they're going to probably always buy a remote that has.
SPEAKER_01: Well, then then do you put voice recognition?
SPEAKER_01: Do you put the receiver on the actual television in the base or in the actual remote?
SPEAKER_01: Because then you've already got the mode in the hand.
SPEAKER_01: Why are you just going to speak to the remote?
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: Whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk after it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Well, and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device too.
SPEAKER_03: If we said find remote, locate remote or something.
SPEAKER_03: A certain phrase.
SPEAKER_03: Then it could beep.
SPEAKER_03: Just thrown it out there.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
None: Wow.
SPEAKER_01: 15 minutes.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
None: Anything else you want to discuss?
SPEAKER_01: Well, do we want to include the numbers like 0, 3, 9?
SPEAKER_01: Can we conceive and leave them out?
SPEAKER_01: Wait, on the remote itself?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Like you have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0.
SPEAKER_01: Well, we definitely need those.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we need those out.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, if you can conceive, it's like, well, I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: It's just a way of leaving them out.
SPEAKER_04: I think people would find that too foreign.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's true.
SPEAKER_03: And also remember that in this day and age, we need like a hundred button too.
SPEAKER_03: I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like 50.
SPEAKER_03: So whenever I got cable, I had to get a new TV.
SPEAKER_04: So we get sadly.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, so you get your own remote or digital cable.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I guess we're going to discuss the project financing later, making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, because I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment.
SPEAKER_03: I don't forget we need to include the color of our company and the logo.
SPEAKER_01: The color being yellow.
SPEAKER_03: I'm guessing.
SPEAKER_03: I feel like the yellow army to get rich.
SPEAKER_02: We could just have the logo in yellow or maybe a yellow light for the kids.
SPEAKER_02: I'll put like stripes.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah, yellow.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, yellow could be, and it doesn't have to be huge.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Well, if you have like a, you have sort of strip kind of.
SPEAKER_01: But kind of down at the bottom, the base of it's just like yellow with the R.
SPEAKER_00: Right.
SPEAKER_03: So we've simplified.
SPEAKER_03: We don't need all those play fast forward, rewind.
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_03: No menu buttons.
SPEAKER_03: So we've pretty much paired it down to on off volume, mute, channel up and down.
SPEAKER_03: The numbers.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Can we go back to, I'm going to look really quickly back at those two examples.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And see if there's anything which one is yours technical functions.
SPEAKER_02: So yeah, yeah, audio, audio settings and screen settings.
SPEAKER_02: We need those like audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, screen settings like brightness color.
SPEAKER_02: Or do we just want that access access from the television itself?
SPEAKER_03: I think that that's fine just through the TV.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff?
SPEAKER_01: Well, the other opposite sort of like down at the bottom, like farther away.
SPEAKER_01: You just have the sort of box in that where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much.
SPEAKER_01: But occasionally you will use.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, because we need to, we definitely need to have buttons for like subtitles and things like that.
SPEAKER_02: Because the foreign film market is expanding and stuff. And like on television, like I know living in Los Angeles, it's tons of Spanish network television.
SPEAKER_02: And if it has English subtitles, it's definitely helpful.
SPEAKER_03: Can we do that off through one button?
SPEAKER_03: There's a menu button that pops up with the menu on the TV that says you know audio, video, whatever language, you know?
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_02: So we need up, down inside the side buttons.
SPEAKER_01: For the menu, you can just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons.
SPEAKER_01: That's true.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, channels just up and down.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And then something that, such as, yeah, the ones, you know, going over there on the left, the engineering center.
SPEAKER_02: Right, right, right, right.
SPEAKER_02: That one.
SPEAKER_01: So we just have like add a menu button then for the various things needed.
SPEAKER_01: Including the voice recognition.
SPEAKER_01: If you have any like settings for voice recognition though.
SPEAKER_01: Including the menu.
SPEAKER_01: Yep.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I just got an idea for a design.
SPEAKER_02: Good.
SPEAKER_03: Anybody have anything else I'd like to bring up in this meeting?
SPEAKER_04: I had something but I forgot.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: You can get out of here.
SPEAKER_03: Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next.
SPEAKER_03: All right.
SPEAKER_03: After this meeting, we're going to be sent a questionnaire and summary again, which we need to reply to that email.
SPEAKER_03: And then we're going to have lunch break and after lunch, 30 minutes of individual work time.
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to put the minutes.
SPEAKER_03: I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the product documents folder.
SPEAKER_03: If you'd like to review them.
SPEAKER_03: And I'm going to type up the minutes for this one as well.
SPEAKER_03: Here's what we're each going to do.
SPEAKER_03: The ID is going to work on the components concept.
SPEAKER_03: UID, the user interface concept.
SPEAKER_03: And you're going to do some trend watching.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach.
SPEAKER_03: And if anybody has anything they would like to add?
