SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
None: Now my laptop is running.
None: Does it again?
SPEAKER_03: It's working.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Good afternoon.
SPEAKER_03: Good afternoon.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Everybody found this place again?
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: That's nice.
SPEAKER_03: This is our second meeting and still failing.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And now we're going into the functional design.
SPEAKER_03: Important thing of this phase is that we're going to try together agreement about the user requirements, technical function design and the working design.
SPEAKER_03: So that we can move on to the second phase.
SPEAKER_03: But first is phase.
SPEAKER_03: First announcement.
SPEAKER_03: There's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system.
SPEAKER_03: So there's our ghost mouse again.
SPEAKER_03: But that means that you can have a little trouble with the air conditioning.
SPEAKER_03: That's because of this.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: It's in Wing C and E.
SPEAKER_03: So it should be over in a while.
SPEAKER_03: A couple of days.
SPEAKER_03: It's going to be cold anyway.
SPEAKER_03: So I don't think you're going to need it.
SPEAKER_03: Then our agenda.
SPEAKER_03: Now first the opening.
SPEAKER_03: This time I will take the minutes.
SPEAKER_03: You're going to have a presentation.
SPEAKER_03: All of you.
SPEAKER_03: And we've got 40 minutes for the whole presentation.
SPEAKER_03: So I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation.
SPEAKER_03: And then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements, which have been sent to me.
SPEAKER_03: And then the decision on the control functions, which we want to include.
SPEAKER_03: So we've got 40 minutes for all of it.
SPEAKER_03: So I suggest let's start with the first presentation.
SPEAKER_01: Who wants to be first?
SPEAKER_03: I think I'll go first.
SPEAKER_03: So maybe it's easy if you.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think you will tell them your presentation is all which function you have.
SPEAKER_03: What are you going to talk about?
SPEAKER_01: Okay, my name is Freak from Poland.
SPEAKER_01: I'm the market expert, but you already knew that.
SPEAKER_01: I've done some research.
SPEAKER_01: We have been doing research in a usability lab where we observe users operating remote controls.
SPEAKER_01: We let them fill out a questionnaire.
SPEAKER_01: We had 100 of these test subjects.
SPEAKER_01: In addition, we did some market research.
SPEAKER_01: See what the market consists of.
SPEAKER_01: What ages are involved?
SPEAKER_01: Well, these are three quite astonishing results, I thought.
SPEAKER_01: Remote being considered ugly.
SPEAKER_01: 75% of the people question indicated that they thought their remote was ugly.
SPEAKER_01: An additional 80% indicated that it would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control.
SPEAKER_01: So an addition remote were not very functional.
SPEAKER_01: 50% of the people indicated they only used about 10% of the buttons on a remote control.
SPEAKER_01: And 50% of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room.
SPEAKER_01: So some things.
SPEAKER_01: Then we did some research to do most relevant functions.
SPEAKER_01: Channel selection and volume selection both got a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 for relevancy.
SPEAKER_01: The power button got a 9 and 10 detects got a 6 and a half.
SPEAKER_01: So these are the most important functions of a remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Then there are some one time use function.
SPEAKER_01: That's what I like to call them.
SPEAKER_01: They're audio settings, video settings, and channel settings buttons, which are not really used very frequently, but are still considered to be of some importance.
SPEAKER_01: Channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently, 168 times per hour.
SPEAKER_01: Then these are the, this is the market.
SPEAKER_01: 60% of the market consists of users between the ages 16 and 46.
SPEAKER_01: The main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on a remote control.
SPEAKER_01: They like to use new functions, but they also are very critical.
SPEAKER_01: They won't spend their money very easily.
SPEAKER_01: The users of 46 to 65 years, they make up 40% of the market.
SPEAKER_01: They're not really very interested in features, but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier.
SPEAKER_01: What I think this indicates for our design, I think we should make a remote for the future.
SPEAKER_01: This means we would have to focus on the ages 16 to 45.
SPEAKER_01: This also makes the biggest part of the market, so there will also be where our main profit would be getable.
SPEAKER_01: This would mean we would have to make a fancy design.
SPEAKER_01: The results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned, thought that remote control caused errors eye.
SPEAKER_01: This is certainly something to take into account.
SPEAKER_01: 34% thought that it was hard to learn how to operate the new remote control.
SPEAKER_01: These are two factors that I think should be included in the design.
SPEAKER_01: Besides, of course, the remote must look very nice.
SPEAKER_01: Functionality.
SPEAKER_01: As a lot of people indicated, they only use about 10% of the buttons.
SPEAKER_01: I think we should make very few buttons.
SPEAKER_01: This will also be beneficial to the design of the remote.
SPEAKER_01: I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasized, especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons, because they are used most.
SPEAKER_01: They should be robust.
SPEAKER_01: They shouldn't break down easily.
SPEAKER_01: Then, as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room, and I say it might be because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot.
SPEAKER_01: But it might be a good idea to make a docking station.
SPEAKER_01: It could get a button in it, which would send a signal to the remote, which would be unbeap, so you'd know where it is in the room.
SPEAKER_01: And in addition to this, it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in.
SPEAKER_01: Then, surprisingly, a great deal of people indicated that an LCD screen in the remote control would be preferred.
SPEAKER_01: This was mostly people in the age of 16 to 25, but up till 45 it remains feasible.
SPEAKER_01: This would also greatly increase the production costs, but I think these are just some small factors we could consider.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: That would be all.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: Anybody have any questions?
SPEAKER_03: About functional requirements?
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, that's clear.
SPEAKER_03: Add to the second.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Up and down, could you add that?
SPEAKER_00: Usually interface, of it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you can take your time.
SPEAKER_03: We've got plenty of time.
SPEAKER_00: That's a bit of a slideshow.
SPEAKER_00: I think we use the general functions of the remote control.
SPEAKER_00: During a little research on the internet, we're not much information about it.
SPEAKER_00: About the interface.
SPEAKER_00: I've been thinking about simple manner to put a lot of functions in one remote control.
SPEAKER_00: You've got a lot of devices like DVD, television, stereo.
SPEAKER_00: But it must be user-friendly.
SPEAKER_00: So you can put a lot of functions in one remote control.
SPEAKER_00: But yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I've got many functions in one remote control.
SPEAKER_00: But yeah, you can see this is quite simple remote control.
SPEAKER_00: Fewer buttons.
SPEAKER_00: But this remote control.
SPEAKER_00: Got a lot of buttons.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: People don't like it.
SPEAKER_00: Keep the general functions like they are.
SPEAKER_00: Like the on-off button.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Like a red button.
SPEAKER_00: Everybody knows it.
SPEAKER_00: You don't have to change that.
SPEAKER_00: Personal preferences.
SPEAKER_00: You use a display for specific functions of the different device.
SPEAKER_00: So what I was thinking about was.
SPEAKER_00: You got a remote control.
SPEAKER_00: You got a general functions like the on-off button.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: Here you got this kind of display.
SPEAKER_00: It's a touch screen.
SPEAKER_00: You got a general functions of the device for a DVD player.
SPEAKER_00: For a player, a reverse, etc.
SPEAKER_00: You got a real buttons for selecting a device.
SPEAKER_00: So this button is for DVD or...
SPEAKER_00: So for every device you got a part display of a part of a button.
SPEAKER_00: You never got all the buttons on one device.
SPEAKER_00: That's my idea about it.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Let's see.
SPEAKER_00: So touch screen.
SPEAKER_00: The real buttons we have to use.
SPEAKER_00: We better use quite large buttons for everybody.
SPEAKER_00: Everybody after you see it.
SPEAKER_00: So, all people, young people.
SPEAKER_00: So we must keep buttons quite simple and quite large.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It was my part of it.
SPEAKER_03: There are questions about technical functions.
SPEAKER_02: Do you think if we're going to use a touch screen, we're going to go way above the 12.5 euros?
SPEAKER_00: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_00: You got quite cheap touch screens.
SPEAKER_00: It's not in color or something.
SPEAKER_00: It's just one color.
SPEAKER_00: I've seen something on the internet, not today, a few weeks ago.
SPEAKER_00: You got quite a kind of touch screen.
SPEAKER_00: For 20 euros or less.
SPEAKER_00: So it's possible.
SPEAKER_01: Well, we certainly make a fancy design.
SPEAKER_02: But it wouldn't be very robust.
SPEAKER_02: It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it.
SPEAKER_01: That is true.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe you can first listen to your presentation.
SPEAKER_03: Then we have a little discussion about the requirements.
SPEAKER_03: Design.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's going to.
SPEAKER_02: OK, I've got a presentation about the working design.
SPEAKER_02: First about how it works.
SPEAKER_02: It's really simple.
SPEAKER_02: Of course, everybody knows how remote works.
SPEAKER_02: The user presses a button.
SPEAKER_02: They remote determines what button it is.
SPEAKER_02: It uses the infrared to send the signal to the TV.
SPEAKER_02: The TV switches to the frequency or what function it is.
SPEAKER_02: So we've got the plate.
SPEAKER_02: It's a interactive disk for every button.
SPEAKER_02: When the user presses a button, the signal goes to the LED and transmits it to the TV.
SPEAKER_02: It's a very simple device, technically speaking.
SPEAKER_02: So this is a schematic overview.
SPEAKER_02: You've got the buttons, the power source.
SPEAKER_02: When the button gets pressed, it goes to the chip.
SPEAKER_02: It controls the infrared bulb and perhaps a normal bulb.
SPEAKER_02: When you press a button, you can actually see your pressed button.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I think we should use default materials, simple plastics.
SPEAKER_02: Keep the inner working simple so it's robust.
SPEAKER_02: I think we should focus on aesthetics, the design, and the user interface, because if you're going to use high-tech materials, the price is going to go sky high.
SPEAKER_02: You only have to design a remote once, and if you use high-tech materials, it comes back in every product.
SPEAKER_02: So in my idea, it's going to be smart to invest in design and not in the product itself.
SPEAKER_02: That's it.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, thank you.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now.
SPEAKER_03: I am the project manager, so I'm here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements.
SPEAKER_03: We've got to design a remote which is only suitable for TV.
SPEAKER_03: That's because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big.
SPEAKER_03: If we want to have it for more functions, so it has to be simple.
SPEAKER_03: Another point is we have to skip the data text because in the world of upcoming internet, we think the data text is going to be a thing of the past.
SPEAKER_03: It's a function we don't need in our remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Internet is also mentioned just to go in a function we can use, maybe also on televisions that will be available as well.
SPEAKER_03: Another one is the customer is 40 plus.
SPEAKER_03: That's the market we have to target because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers.
SPEAKER_03: This is a bit pity for the marketing expert because he was aiming on the younger persons.
SPEAKER_03: We have to find a market which is above 40 plus but we will suit our remote control and the other way around.
SPEAKER_03: We have to be very attentive in putting the corporate image in our product.
SPEAKER_03: It has to be visible in our design in the way our device works.
SPEAKER_03: We have to be very clear on this point as well.
SPEAKER_03: I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions.
SPEAKER_01: Is there any discussion possible about the requirements?
SPEAKER_03: We can see if we can find a way between the functions we want to use and the market we want to reach with our products.
SPEAKER_01: We are saying that Teletex is going to be an old feature and it's not going to be used any more anyway.
SPEAKER_01: Pretty soon new TVs will have internet access on them.
SPEAKER_01: If you are targeting people of 40 plus, the chance that they will have a TV with internet access within the next 20 years is very slim.
SPEAKER_01: In addition, people indicated that Teletex was an important feature for the remote control.
SPEAKER_01: So I think it's pretty dumb to put no Teletex feature on it.
SPEAKER_01: I'm pretty much against it.
SPEAKER_01: Against the no-deletex.
SPEAKER_01: Besides that, I think the market for 40 plus is pretty small.
SPEAKER_01: But I think we are just going to go for another step.
SPEAKER_01: Pretty.
SPEAKER_03: I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which are also mentioned.
SPEAKER_03: If we put a lot of effort in those, we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons or just three modes which is suitable for the market we want to reach because it is 40% of the market.
SPEAKER_03: If you look in Holland, the whole generation of 40 plus, 50 plus, it's the biggest share of the whole population now.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, but it's not the biggest part of the market.
SPEAKER_01: Besides that, they're not very critical.
SPEAKER_01: What the remote control is like.
SPEAKER_01: It will just take the first thing I see which looks acceptable.
SPEAKER_03: But don't you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market, the people think from the people think that's the device I've looked for.
SPEAKER_03: I didn't realize it, so let's try it.
SPEAKER_01: I think that would be the case in 16 to 45 ages category.
SPEAKER_01: Because they are critical and they want to have a fancy remote control.
SPEAKER_01: People are 40 plus.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, they want it to work but as soon as it works, it's okay with them.
SPEAKER_02: I think that if we put our marketing right, we can sell this just like, I don't know if you've heard about it in the news, the elderly mobile phone.
SPEAKER_02: It's a big success.
SPEAKER_02: If we make a remote control, just with that idea in mind, we could make tons of money.
SPEAKER_02: We don't have to focus on the design then but on functionality.
SPEAKER_02: We just change our focus on the project.
SPEAKER_02: I think we can sell this.
SPEAKER_03: I simply think that the new products we're going to make specifically designed are designed for younger people.
SPEAKER_03: So maybe we can focus ourselves on the elderly people.
SPEAKER_03: I think we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls.
SPEAKER_03: Because what you told is the channel selection is important.
SPEAKER_03: Volume selection, power and tailored text.
SPEAKER_01: But obviously the board tends to disagree.
SPEAKER_03: No, we haven't voted yet.
SPEAKER_03: I think tailored text can be a function as well.
SPEAKER_03: But only if you don't hire the cost.
SPEAKER_03: Because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement tailored text as well.
SPEAKER_03: So I think that there will be a problem.
SPEAKER_00: Or is tailored text.
SPEAKER_03: Definitely a bad idea not to include it.
SPEAKER_03: Is anybody really against tailored text?
SPEAKER_03: Let's just keep the tailored text.
SPEAKER_03: I think that's a good idea as well, especially for the subtitles.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe we can make that another point of advantage in our remote control.
SPEAKER_03: If we make a button, for example, for big subtitles, which is instantly on the remote control for elderly people that they can think, why I want to have subtitles and push the button and they get the big subtitles.
SPEAKER_03: That's a good idea.
SPEAKER_03: So I think that text can be very useful in our advantage.
SPEAKER_03: Functionality should be few buttons, you said?
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: I think that's very important.
SPEAKER_03: We have a few buttons.
SPEAKER_03: So it's a good button.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think it's really an issue anymore.
SPEAKER_01: Well, it might be.
SPEAKER_01: If it's only for TV, you're not going to need a lot of buttons anyway.
SPEAKER_01: We need one to zero button, next channel, previous channel, volume up, volume down.
SPEAKER_01: And some tailored text buttons.
SPEAKER_03: But do you need the buttons for one to zero?
SPEAKER_01: Maybe we can...
SPEAKER_01: I think many people like to use that.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe we can use...
SPEAKER_01: I want to switch from channel one to like 35.
SPEAKER_01: You know when I push the next channel button 35 times.
SPEAKER_03: I can implement the scroll button or joystick.
SPEAKER_03: There are other ways to...
SPEAKER_03: Just look, if you look at telephones, the Sony Telephone and the scroll button, which is very useful in searching names or...
SPEAKER_01: That is true, but...
SPEAKER_01: I don't think there are many TVs that can switch channels that fast.
SPEAKER_01: So you would need like...
SPEAKER_01: A function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it.
SPEAKER_01: And I don't know if many channels do have that.
SPEAKER_02: If any TVs have that.
SPEAKER_02: And besides that, if we're going to focus on elderly people, they'll have to adapt.
SPEAKER_02: They're not used to using scroll buttons.
SPEAKER_02: Perhaps we should stick to the basic layout.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, there are numbers.
SPEAKER_03: We can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display.
SPEAKER_03: And if it's too much, we can reconsider it.
SPEAKER_03: But I think there won't be very much buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Or there don't have to be...
SPEAKER_01: I think if you're going to make remote control only to operate a TV, there's not much you can gain on...
SPEAKER_01: Having as few buttons as possible.
SPEAKER_01: Because I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a TV, which already only have the minimum number of buttons.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think there's much to be gained in that area.
SPEAKER_03: The number of buttons.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's very important in the design.
SPEAKER_03: You can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places.
SPEAKER_03: If you have less buttons, you can do a lot more with it.
SPEAKER_01: That's true, but I think there's not much to gain on the competition when you're making a remote control only to operate only the TV.
SPEAKER_01: If you have a remote control only to operate a TV, there's not a lot of buttons required.
SPEAKER_01: There's not a lot of functions required.
SPEAKER_01: Most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either.
SPEAKER_01: I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here.
SPEAKER_01: We can...
SPEAKER_01: Note costs a big marketing expedition.
SPEAKER_01: That's right.
SPEAKER_01: Which was one of the arguments to make it only for the TV because we didn't have the time to market a lot.
SPEAKER_03: You should just focus on, for example, the docking station, like other functions.
SPEAKER_03: Instead of less buttons.
SPEAKER_01: I think we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons.
SPEAKER_01: But I don't think we should spend very much time in that.
SPEAKER_03: Do you think the docking station is allowed in the budget we have?
SPEAKER_02: It should be possible, yes.
SPEAKER_02: Because it's not too fancy.
SPEAKER_02: And if the remote stays rather small, it should be possible.
SPEAKER_03: Because I think that's a good advantage point as well.
SPEAKER_03: If we have a fancy looking docking station or...
SPEAKER_03: That's a nice requirement for the docking station.
SPEAKER_02: So we're just going to focus on the extras.
SPEAKER_03: I think so.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think maybe we should do some research into what other people like to have in a...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, like to have extra and in remote control.
SPEAKER_03: That's a good point.
SPEAKER_03: You said they easily get lost as well?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, well, 50% of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost.
SPEAKER_03: So maybe we should implement the audio side or something.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that was what I suggested.
SPEAKER_01: Like with your keychain, if you were to show it goes.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it makes a sound.
SPEAKER_01: You have some phones too.
SPEAKER_01: Do you have a docking station?
SPEAKER_01: You just press a button and the phone goes ringing.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, so...
SPEAKER_03: Audio signal should be possible as well.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's not too expensive.
SPEAKER_03: Another point is the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know if that will rise to cost too much.
SPEAKER_02: I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen because...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's a little bit too much.
SPEAKER_01: I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices, it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it which will explain a button if you press it which would tell you what it does.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And it wouldn't have to be touch screen or expensive screen but...
SPEAKER_03: Just the LCD or just the normal screen.
SPEAKER_03: Just a screen ID.
SPEAKER_03: Some extra info.
SPEAKER_03: Feedback.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think that's a good idea as well.
SPEAKER_01: But I don't know if that would...
SPEAKER_03: Is this small screen fit into the...
SPEAKER_01: cost...
SPEAKER_03: extra button info.
SPEAKER_03: I think that should be possible as well.
SPEAKER_03: Let's see what did we say...
SPEAKER_03: More.
SPEAKER_03: Should be fancy to design.
SPEAKER_03: Is it to learn?
SPEAKER_03: Few buttons.
SPEAKER_03: We talked about that.
SPEAKER_03: Talking Station LCD.
SPEAKER_03: General functions.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And default materials.
SPEAKER_03: I think that's a good idea as well because...
SPEAKER_03: So don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one.
SPEAKER_03: So it doesn't really matter.
SPEAKER_01: Probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls and youngsters.
SPEAKER_03: And let's specify the target group.
SPEAKER_03: Are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from 40 to...
SPEAKER_03: 80 because I think what we're going to design now is for people above 60.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe.
SPEAKER_03: What do we want?
SPEAKER_03: If we want to...
SPEAKER_03: profil it as with...
SPEAKER_03: For example, the telephone for elderly people.
SPEAKER_03: We can target the real elderly people.
SPEAKER_01: I think that would be...
SPEAKER_01: If we should do something like that, it would be...
SPEAKER_01: I think it would be really good for the image of the company.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And I think there would be a good market for it.
SPEAKER_01: So that's the...
SPEAKER_01: Really bring an innovative product.
SPEAKER_03: You're talking about 60 to 80, for example.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: The really...
SPEAKER_03: About 60.
SPEAKER_01: I'd have to look into that a little more.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. And different cultures.
SPEAKER_03: Are we?
SPEAKER_02: I don't think they have different television sets in every country.
SPEAKER_00: No.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: You've got five minutes left.
SPEAKER_03: It's small work.
SPEAKER_01: And with the little screen in it, which explains the buttons, I think it would be a lot easier to adapt to different cultures.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah. In different languages.
SPEAKER_03: Or you have to put a language button in it, but that will be a bit unnecessary, I think.
SPEAKER_03: It's better to put it on different markets with...
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So that's the target.
SPEAKER_03: Then a few small things.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I will put the minutes in the project document folder.
SPEAKER_03: What we're going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept.
SPEAKER_03: Use the interface design and the user interface concept and the trend watching.
SPEAKER_03: So just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group requirements and the trends, which we're going on.
SPEAKER_03: And the specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So I thank you for this meeting.
SPEAKER_03: And I think we have a lunch break now.
SPEAKER_00: That's good.
SPEAKER_03: So that's a good thing.
SPEAKER_01: Now we're not allowed to talk about it.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
