SPEAKER_03: if you please want to sit down and I'm gonna show you
SPEAKER_00: sure
SPEAKER_02: it's not safe yet
SPEAKER_00: okay
SPEAKER_02: so
None: okay it's gonna be beautiful drawing
SPEAKER_03: so just so this is our agenda you're going to show your prototype presentation after me
SPEAKER_01: oops
SPEAKER_03: oh yeah so these are the
SPEAKER_01: oh okay
SPEAKER_03: so these are the last notes we made if anything doesn't look right just say to me I don't know if people didn't report
SPEAKER_02: you know we're doing the speech recognition because didn't have enough time to design the inside as well
SPEAKER_03: okay but still possible financially so if you want to okay then we're gonna put it in
SPEAKER_02: yeah we have to design the inside then but
SPEAKER_01: are we making a slide open like underneath or fold open
SPEAKER_03: slide open is quite usual for remote control
SPEAKER_01: yeah like underneath you can slide it open and you can and maybe that's stronger as well yeah that's it's okay
SPEAKER_02: okay I think that's better and you have a lot of room inside so you can make it very easy to use because you can write a lot of comments besides
SPEAKER_03: okay so this is okay I'll cool to you
SPEAKER_02: no we're gonna use advanced chips then
SPEAKER_03: okay so that's just how much that is okay for the speech yeah I think so I don't know no you have a different chip for speech recognition okay so I'll read it calculated that and still in the
SPEAKER_02: butch it's okay
None: good so you can show your prototype if you want to
SPEAKER_01: yeah together yeah let's do it together I'll give comments okay yeah we just made a word file with the basic elements the look and feel model well the form the case as drawn there simply a square with round corners so that's basically it the materials should be hard plastic color changeable and also transparent color and transparent or just transparent I don't know then the elements we have the functions are just basic like I've pointed a mere mute function on off function text functions this is the switch channel okay cool and this is the the numpad and the logo is over here in the mic okay and scroll you'll know you operate that with your pointing finger so you hold it like this in your right hand and
SPEAKER_03: so how many things do you need for the microphone speech recognition
SPEAKER_02: only one button to say it's a specification of that but I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something
SPEAKER_01: yeah maybe you have to configure it
SPEAKER_02: yes you need options to figure it and after that you don't need them anymore so you can put it on the back as well if you
SPEAKER_01: yeah you can all have around the slide function I don't know okay well we haven't had time to design that the slides
SPEAKER_02: we also don't know how many buttons are required or what kind of buttons but you have a lot of room if you can slide it open yeah you can put it on the back I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something so enough room
SPEAKER_01: the position yeah you're right
SPEAKER_02: you wrote this so well name the main zap buttons armor center this was the most important thing so best read place best read place buttons text buttons mute buttons archicadder and at the place they usually are easy to find the enough button is bit bigger so it stands out that why you don't have to make it right because it will show up a score we lose on the left side it's basically the standard place for score
SPEAKER_01: but it's not impossible to use it if you're left handed so because you can use your thumb then
SPEAKER_00: just one thing now you need to have more one two you've got one two three four five six seven eight nine but you missed the zero and the two
SPEAKER_02: strides
SPEAKER_04: I'm just so you get that
SPEAKER_00: okay but it's rather important
SPEAKER_02: we just missed that well just okay back to later the foreign well you have taken that from the iPod other popular technical device so it should be popular with the buttons creating if you that are all round shapes not around its corners okay so that now you get a bit of round feeling no use hard plastic since that allows us to use the 2D buttons non-rober buttons color changeable well and the backlight thing the thing that lights up we have decided in the channel buttons there's a little color around it okay and also in the numpad there's also color around the light behind it
SPEAKER_03: and we still can choose what color you want how do you want to implement that maybe on the second level as well
SPEAKER_01: yeah these are just basic functions so all the non-basic
SPEAKER_03: okay just draw the second level which is we need that as well
SPEAKER_00: okay there's one function I use daily and it's not on the basic functions it's to switch to your score PlayStation or DVD player okay maybe we use this button for that yeah maybe or you can lay it beneath and the other yeah as well
SPEAKER_03: do you make your device maybe just draw second level one and say all options that are still left or something a second level
SPEAKER_01: new
SPEAKER_03: just here
SPEAKER_00: how does the second level come out it's light so it's light I think yeah you can maybe
SPEAKER_02: you can do it with the claps open but I think that's not solid no that's not good
SPEAKER_03: yeah that's right
SPEAKER_02: it doesn't even have to slide all the way up so what do we need the speech functions buttons
SPEAKER_01: yeah just
SPEAKER_02: menu menu button with maybe arrows so you can roll in the navigate the menu oh my god I think we can even put we have one for zero and one for the more digit so this is the video channel PlayStation that's used pretty often yeah but you have PlayStation
SPEAKER_01: you use it every day basic
None: external you want to save the files yeah
None: drawing so here are multiple speech buttons I don't know how many doesn't really
SPEAKER_02: it doesn't matter that it's stable what else what else menu buttons
SPEAKER_00: yeah it's with the arrows
SPEAKER_02: like things best if we do where do we
SPEAKER_01: like a normal
SPEAKER_02: like on the normal
SPEAKER_01: like this
SPEAKER_02: yeah within the middle a menu button well you don't have any anything on how many buttons speech you cry so it can't really
None: design it maybe one button to switch the color of your lets and you can hold it
SPEAKER_02: and hold it and then
SPEAKER_03: we can use the colors which you can maybe we just make it three buttons
SPEAKER_00: all the colors on it red yeah if you have enough place and then we can do that we can put those here color buttons
None: and then we choose green blue and red ok ok that's
SPEAKER_01: so did we miss anything
SPEAKER_02: maybe some text that is probably that there's volume
SPEAKER_00: ok yeah yeah but there's one text that
SPEAKER_02: is on here ok
SPEAKER_00: that's the one that you use if you search for a page like 700 and it's counting from 100 to 200 you will switch to your television
SPEAKER_01: and back yeah but then you can switch back to normal
SPEAKER_03: you just switch it off
SPEAKER_01: and then just put it on the extra button and if you press it again you get the the stage is yeah but if you are in a second stage the third stage is switch teletext off so
SPEAKER_04: you can switch back from
SPEAKER_00: the second to turn off just remember where it was it doesn't clear the page if you turn teletext on you set the screen on it still stays ok ok
SPEAKER_03: maybe it's not
SPEAKER_02: the way
SPEAKER_00: that's a functionality for the
None: television yeah I think as well but
SPEAKER_01: oh yeah that's maybe one yeah we can discuss about no the remote can send like the code for 700
SPEAKER_02: page 700 to the television
SPEAKER_03: if you switch it yeah that's true
SPEAKER_02: yeah I know do we need to fix that
SPEAKER_00: or those new TVs do collect all the pages yeah those memories not every
None: television yeah this logo for volume yeah that's fine
None: so that's it is this pretty much it yeah I thought about one thing
SPEAKER_00: the buttons from which material are they now just like your telephone yeah just hard plastic because it's very expensive to make it from a different material if you use it a couple of years sometimes the numbers on the buttons are slide away and maybe we can describe the numbers below or above or shall we just turn it on the buttons I think just
SPEAKER_02: if you do it above or below it takes
SPEAKER_00: too much space
SPEAKER_02: yeah I don't think just lays this for a
SPEAKER_01: yeah I think you have a
SPEAKER_00: problem more often with rubber buttons yeah we have rubber buttons okay fine
SPEAKER_03: yeah okay
None: yeah yeah I don't know what this means but I think we just evaluated this one
SPEAKER_00: yeah I made some criteria okay you made some good evaluate or model okay I didn't don't think
None: you have some usability criteria okay I know all the criteria as we just argue about
SPEAKER_00: in the bottom look at feel
SPEAKER_01: evaluation is
None: yeah evaluation presentation it's not here
SPEAKER_00: yeah
None: yeah it's not here it doesn't matter it only had two pages or something well I looked in the reports from the marketing strategy or the new needs and the market, the Italians how they think about it and the research about the the the users and that kind of stuff and I made some criteria and we have to test the criteria from one to zero we can give it a number and then we can give herself an average for our model and these are all the same I found or I wrote down and we have to discuss
SPEAKER_03: if we give it one or a seven I think if you have a kind of
SPEAKER_00: I pulled idea why beautiful the difference between a beautiful fancy look and feel is the outside beautiful like the I pulled or something and the colors and that kind of stuff
SPEAKER_02: I think if you can get the I-POP look then it's beautiful
SPEAKER_00: yes what kind of basic colors where you thought of the basic colors are black or green or yellow
SPEAKER_02: how do we make maybe a company colors
SPEAKER_03: black
SPEAKER_00: yellow light
SPEAKER_03: no really
SPEAKER_02: but just a bit of yellow black white maybe black white
SPEAKER_00: and what colors should the buttons be
SPEAKER_03: different colors the same as the cover
SPEAKER_01: can you change those with the switch
SPEAKER_03: just make them black
SPEAKER_02: or grey just dark grey
SPEAKER_00: what number do we give at beautiful is really subjective because it has to do lots with the colors we have changeable phones for everyone is something beautiful
SPEAKER_03: give it one it's perfect
SPEAKER_02: I think it's just what you want it's hard to decide for us it's a lot better than current for motor controls
SPEAKER_03: okay just 52
SPEAKER_00: okay the fancy look and feel that's about our flashing lights and the background lights from the buttons and we can change the colors so that's really fancy
SPEAKER_01: one more thing are we changing are they on the slide panel or no backlight slide panel
SPEAKER_03: no it's only on the behind the numbers
SPEAKER_01: and the switch channel is
SPEAKER_03: this here
SPEAKER_02: yeah but it's on this here
SPEAKER_00: it's pretty cool if you slide it open it lights up that's really fancy but I don't know if it's reachable
SPEAKER_02: of course it's reachable then we do it maybe just some light to light it all up you can see what's really there not just on the buttons or something just the green light
SPEAKER_03: or from blue light
SPEAKER_01: just backlight not the buttons and the normal backlight also not the buttons behind the buttons
SPEAKER_02: so the buttons are just great yeah that's only here
SPEAKER_00: okay fine so I think it's very fancy
SPEAKER_02: yeah so I've done a lot of detail in light
SPEAKER_00: so yeah and you can also choose in light so
SPEAKER_03: yeah this is one
SPEAKER_00: I think this one
SPEAKER_03: okay next this is a difficult one because we don't
SPEAKER_00: we don't know about we should test it
SPEAKER_03: it's very easy to use the second layer is not easy to use it's that's
SPEAKER_01: no but you don't have to use that and you don't have to pay attention to that second layer that's the main thing
SPEAKER_02: that's so good about
SPEAKER_00: I think it's easy to use learnable it's not as fast as a usual remote control because I think the scroll wheel it's very handy but the first time you get this thing in your hands is not to use the scroll wheel see for it and up or down but the rest of it is very easy
SPEAKER_03: because there's so
SPEAKER_02: yeah I think it's very clear
SPEAKER_01: so a few information that you can easily decide what buttons for what function
SPEAKER_02: the second part like speech as that will be hard to learn so it is learnable
SPEAKER_03: and first of all it's very easy to use and I think it's scroll wheel easy to use as well if you have ever used a different kind of yeah
SPEAKER_00: we've got two or three new things and maybe learnable is in compare of old fashioned remote controls so we have speech scroll wheel and the slide you must slide it and that's not normal and a normal remote controls less than easy to use because
SPEAKER_03: used use comes after manual
SPEAKER_02: so just give it it to maybe it's free then learnable
SPEAKER_03: no but definitely better than
SPEAKER_01: normal then the one you showed is just all buttons
SPEAKER_02: and you don't know then a tool
SPEAKER_03: okay
SPEAKER_00: new feature is technological innovative speech function and the new scroll wheel and the slide I think the slide is pretty new it's not new
SPEAKER_03: I only saw it in a telephone not in a digital oh I already have a VCR and it's
SPEAKER_02: from 1988 and the other
SPEAKER_00: slide and it's also the buttons come out as well okay and the lightning is scroll wheel
SPEAKER_02: different colors
SPEAKER_00: yeah different fronts for remote control I think that's new too yeah so we have a pretty new yeah no games it's not a one it's a two again it's not LCD
SPEAKER_02: we also have the home station we are forgetting about that now
SPEAKER_03: oh yeah that's why
SPEAKER_01: it's rechargeable
SPEAKER_02: yeah we didn't draw that too
SPEAKER_03: but that's more like now
SPEAKER_01: yeah just draw it afterwards
SPEAKER_03: it's a good thing if you can you save it on the same in the same map as the other ones
SPEAKER_02: in the project map
SPEAKER_03: just save save us save us
SPEAKER_01: well it's already in the fall like number seven
SPEAKER_03: yeah smart words yeah but this one this one is not yet in the I think it is
SPEAKER_01: it's not in the yeah I think it is
SPEAKER_02: run titles yeah it doesn't matter
SPEAKER_04: save you still see the
SPEAKER_03: all the research and you feature so we give it a two or also again a one no I think if you have games on it then you get one
SPEAKER_00: we are not extra ordinary new
SPEAKER_03: it's always still a two targeted audience we are the targeted audience
SPEAKER_00: we we we we search for a young group
SPEAKER_03: young enough 40 so we are exactly the targeted group
SPEAKER_00: yeah but did we reach with our style the targeted audience
SPEAKER_03: that's my question you get the fancy things for younger people and the aesthetic things for older people
SPEAKER_01: we've got a one for fancy looking and that's what attracts the young audience so
SPEAKER_00: yeah the only point is that we don't have that's already that's this question
SPEAKER_01: yeah but that's basically not handy and I don't see yeah so we targeted it
SPEAKER_00: but we didn't follow the latest trends
SPEAKER_01: no yeah you could make a a front latest trends
SPEAKER_04: a front
SPEAKER_00: these are the only like the trend
SPEAKER_02: or something all right
SPEAKER_00: you get different different front yeah so we have like a fruit but then I'll kind of front but spongy will never be no so we give herself a three or something
SPEAKER_03: yeah
SPEAKER_00: let's what's the average?
SPEAKER_03: 11 divided by 6 yeah this is 1.83
SPEAKER_00: upper, face score
SPEAKER_01: no I don't know
SPEAKER_02: we're not too hard on ourselves this is a power indicator okay you can see how far it's
SPEAKER_00: charged up and then you need a button to go
SPEAKER_01: oh yeah that's still yeah but we have to make a speaker
SPEAKER_03: then too if you want to make it
SPEAKER_01: be maybe we have to skip that one that's no one's in but we can do it underneath the logo
SPEAKER_02: if you do a speaker is very small as well yeah okay
SPEAKER_03: so I just got a financial so um
SPEAKER_01: you saved it
SPEAKER_00: yeah I did save it
SPEAKER_03: okay let's have a look at this one here the production cost of it if I forgot anything it's just a battery yeah there are some things that they didn't mention because recharge is not on the list okay so I think we are pretty much in the right direction because it's 12.3 euro
SPEAKER_01: okay but it's uh
SPEAKER_03: so this is a regolith ship and uh as sample speaker okay so that's both
SPEAKER_00: no that's perfect uh 12.3
SPEAKER_03: yeah and single curve
SPEAKER_01: does it include a home station or no that's not on the list
SPEAKER_03: but can we make that for uh
SPEAKER_01: 20 cents yeah we can probably
SPEAKER_03: I just the button I was wondering if this special color maybe was um different fonts
SPEAKER_02: but standard font
SPEAKER_03: I think special for yeah it's hard to say but maybe we have to yeah what is okay special color you can skip this one because it's all quite normal you get different ones at all so you can put the recharge in but this is expensive the sample speaker
SPEAKER_00: yeah yeah it's four it's four euros
SPEAKER_02: oh damn is that uh included it's 12 euro so yeah that's
SPEAKER_01: kind of weird that we have some information now afterwards
SPEAKER_03: yeah no okay so this is pretty much head this way damn solace so uh what's just I just want to yeah we just made it so we can do the projects if your evaluation now for
SPEAKER_00: everything together
SPEAKER_03: okay we can do some discussion about this what's the room for creativity sure yes okay both the room for creativity
SPEAKER_02: yeah thanks I think everyone just shared already
SPEAKER_01: yeah if we got a high mark for innovativeness or innovativity
SPEAKER_02: we probably have been not afraid about it
SPEAKER_00: yeah we could make a lot of different remote controls yeah so it's creativity okay so
None: the leadership wasn't the real leadership then of course there was okay what do you have to say about that no
SPEAKER_02: yeah
SPEAKER_03: yeah yeah yeah
SPEAKER_01: yeah just normal discussion I think not yeah one leader or something one leader to
SPEAKER_02: check the time
SPEAKER_01: yeah and make notes
SPEAKER_03: yeah I know
SPEAKER_02: so more like a secretary
None: yeah okay next one teamwork the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard you were not all agree with that
SPEAKER_01: we had so much information that we get through email
SPEAKER_02: and just we got the wrong information at the wrong time I think that was the biggest problem like the prices if you knew that before we could
SPEAKER_00: get really quicker yeah because the prices could be 20 euro
SPEAKER_02: something that if you had 15 euro then we would discourage
SPEAKER_03: yeah
SPEAKER_01: yeah finance so we're basically just
SPEAKER_03: lucky to get the price right
SPEAKER_00: but the team wearables okay yeah everybody could speak their opinion
SPEAKER_02: I think everyone listen to each other yeah like marketing then we have to include them in the design
SPEAKER_03: yeah okay yeah what I have to say about
None: means the smart board is okay did you pen is horrible and if you use it but if you want to download it
SPEAKER_02: to your computer it doesn't work digital pen smart board would be very very good
SPEAKER_01: yeah it would be faster
SPEAKER_00: it would be
SPEAKER_02: more hard to make yeah it should be more accurate precise and I think it would be great if you could edit it from just with a mouse when
SPEAKER_03: it's hitting yeah not just
SPEAKER_01: it's the same for the presentation
None: yeah no use to draw on the board itself it's just
SPEAKER_01: just closed out yeah just old-fashioned kind of blackboard style but you might as well do it in normal computer style
SPEAKER_02: yeah even hard to draw like this then blackboard
SPEAKER_01: still and it's far too slow this way
SPEAKER_02: yeah okay but not as main function
SPEAKER_03: no I guess I think yeah okay
SPEAKER_00: digital pen
SPEAKER_03: so we made it in time we made it very good we did it the budget yeah
SPEAKER_02: new ideas found
SPEAKER_00: new ideas what's the metaphor for
SPEAKER_03: the better know what I mean
SPEAKER_02: just
None: I just think if you do it to gather or to work together or new ideas for
SPEAKER_03: remote control probably no for the project
SPEAKER_02: for my favorite for your text
SPEAKER_00: no for the prototype new ideas
SPEAKER_01: yeah but still you could make a fancy you could make a prototype because we don't have any sizes and
SPEAKER_03: well it's for the next team yeah
SPEAKER_01: you can possibly do that in such a short time I think
SPEAKER_02: yeah this is the idea phase
SPEAKER_01: yeah just brainstorming
None: yeah details
SPEAKER_01: so are we finished?
SPEAKER_03: yes I think just
SPEAKER_01: just write the final report
SPEAKER_03: okay quite early only four minutes left
SPEAKER_02: okay well what do we have to do then we are for the way we were done at

SPEAKER_02: they went for a touch device but also different devices yeah then also the
SPEAKER_01: with the handy here are the basic functions and here are the selecting of devices
SPEAKER_02: yeah for touch fees for all our stuff I do agree with that
None: so so so so so English is not so hard by the way
SPEAKER_01: no
