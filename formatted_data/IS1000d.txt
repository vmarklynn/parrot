None: I guess you can do it.
SPEAKER_01: Did you get my email with the slides?
SPEAKER_00: I'm gonna change off soon.
None: Yeah.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe I should change the pen otherwise.
SPEAKER_00: I'm gonna come quickly.
SPEAKER_01: Don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe the pen's supposed to go over the seats.
SPEAKER_01: Might be a seat for rather than the person.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm using it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's making pace at me.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So, Matthew is late again.
SPEAKER_05: Probably an important man.
SPEAKER_05: So, well, it is important for him to be here.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So, what I mean is that you did work together.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So, I would be able to summarize our meeting.
SPEAKER_00: But still, I think it would be very important if the as a main designer.
SPEAKER_00: I think it would be important that he's here.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Basically, yeah, we designed two items.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, but we...
SPEAKER_00: Can we have a phone or someone?
SPEAKER_05: Yes, we should phone him.
SPEAKER_05: It's really a work design.
SPEAKER_05: When he's not here, we just have to continue.
SPEAKER_05: So, just for a record, I will take notes again.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Well, first thing, I got an email from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the 12 euro and 50 cents.
SPEAKER_05: He said to me, well, when you stay in, it's good.
SPEAKER_05: When you don't stay in, you have to redesign.
SPEAKER_05: There is no negotiation possible in this matter.
SPEAKER_05: So, we have to consider that.
SPEAKER_05: Good.
SPEAKER_05: So, maybe Anna, you can have your project.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, we had no evaluation until we have a design.
None: Okay.
None: Thank you.
SPEAKER_05: Thank you.
SPEAKER_05: Thank you.
SPEAKER_05: Great, great.
SPEAKER_05: Well, maybe then you can start now with presenting your designs.
SPEAKER_00: So, I will start by the basic one that fits into 8 euros, actually.
SPEAKER_00: Right?
SPEAKER_00: 7, 8 euros.
SPEAKER_00: Well, first, for both, they have a special shape, maybe the designer can explain better than me.
SPEAKER_00: But it's like a surf board.
SPEAKER_00: And you are supposed to surf to browse, to surf TV, maybe the web.
SPEAKER_00: And it's kind of interesting shape because unconsciously people want to surf.
SPEAKER_00: And also, it's not too far from a mobile.
SPEAKER_00: So, people are used to that kind of shape.
SPEAKER_00: Don't take care too much about the color because...
SPEAKER_00: No, yes, I'm supposed to give some more offers.
SPEAKER_00: So, here would be basically the infrared...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, LED.
SPEAKER_00: The on-off button in wet.
SPEAKER_00: Here would be the volume on the left.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: It's easy to turn on and off.
SPEAKER_00: And so, this is a very cheap version, so there are...
SPEAKER_02: Maybe you can carry on with you.
SPEAKER_02: So, you have browsing the channels, actually, so you can go up and down the channels.
SPEAKER_02: If you have a video or something, you can forward...
SPEAKER_00: How can you change from VCR to...
SPEAKER_00:...CV, by the way?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, no, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_02: This is a model with just a TV one.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, sorry.
SPEAKER_02: This is a standard TV one.
SPEAKER_02: We are not talking about that.
SPEAKER_02: So, and then we have usually... there are 12 keys, but we know that we have only 10 digits.
SPEAKER_02: The XR2 are for giving an option for having more than one channel.
SPEAKER_02: And the other one is for the teletext or something you wonder about through from that.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so it's a very basic...
SPEAKER_02: It's a very basic minimal thing which you can...
SPEAKER_02: Which is also available in the market, actually, that's what it is that today.
SPEAKER_02: And it costs us to build these about 80 euros.
SPEAKER_05: Except for the special shape, the surfboard, it has a quite...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05:...conventional layout of buttons.
SPEAKER_02: So, this one model and...
SPEAKER_02: Can I see?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, sure.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I like the volume control, that's good.
SPEAKER_02: This is a magic one, but right now we don't want to talk about that.
SPEAKER_02: It is a very futuristic, it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff.
SPEAKER_02: We are thinking about the future, it can come.
SPEAKER_02: So, it doesn't have any partners.
SPEAKER_02: But then what we live in...
SPEAKER_05: This is a model in the end.
None: I just...
SPEAKER_05: I don't feel so.
SPEAKER_05: I really feel like my mobile phone.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Just signing.
SPEAKER_05: I really want to talk to it.
SPEAKER_05: It won't talk that.
SPEAKER_05: So, but continue with your work.
SPEAKER_02: Well, then this is a...
SPEAKER_02: A little smooth and it gives a lot of functionality in this way.
SPEAKER_02: So, all we have...
SPEAKER_02: You see that there are only six keys, but don't worry, they are doing the job of 12 keys actually here.
SPEAKER_02: And so, they have more space actually and it's easy to use this.
SPEAKER_02: And you have...
SPEAKER_02: So, this is a standard, you have infrared eye and then you have a power button.
SPEAKER_02: You should volume what you have.
SPEAKER_02: And then other than that, you have a channel up and down and the low-pous or...
SPEAKER_02: Slow-downs.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And then you have a LCD display here and this is the functional thing which can change like...
SPEAKER_02: It's a toggle switch which could change the function.
SPEAKER_02: So, DVD player to telephoto.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You can change it to...
SPEAKER_05: Instead of having many switches and then you get feedback, fire the LCD.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, LCD can display what is that on that.
SPEAKER_02: And well, you can have an integrated microphone over here.
SPEAKER_02: This is the oven.
SPEAKER_02: Or an oven button here.
SPEAKER_02: So, which can basically you want to do a speech recognition and the channel or whatever information can be displayed here directly on the...
SPEAKER_02: On your display.
SPEAKER_02: And here is a small LED which is like blinking one.
SPEAKER_02: Which tells you like are you running out of the battery and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier.
SPEAKER_02: And then we have a cover basically.
SPEAKER_02: Basically you don't need much of the time this.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: When you need you can use it.
SPEAKER_02: And this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want.
SPEAKER_02: You can add a tactile thing to this cover.
SPEAKER_05: And then you can add a little bit of a design.
SPEAKER_05: But when this is closed.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: We'll also cover up the LCD.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You want to.
SPEAKER_02: And this gives a protection to the LCD actually giving a cover to that.
SPEAKER_02: Actually.
SPEAKER_02: It gives a protection because when it falls down or something.
SPEAKER_02: It is.
SPEAKER_02: It is.
SPEAKER_02: It's more robust.
SPEAKER_02: It's more robust that way.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And you have very good chances.
SPEAKER_00: It's low weight.
SPEAKER_00: You have to see.
SPEAKER_00: The components we put inside is very low weight.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So the cost is actually a bit more.
SPEAKER_00: It is 16 pounds.
SPEAKER_00: 16 euros.
SPEAKER_02: 16 euros.
SPEAKER_00: 16 euros.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So that's what I was talking about, isn't it?
SPEAKER_00: Then it's out of budget.
SPEAKER_00: The main point we talk about that with our manufacturer.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And they say it basically that the ASR system would be something like three francs per item.
SPEAKER_00: Three euros.
SPEAKER_00: Three euros.
SPEAKER_00: And.
SPEAKER_01: That's on top of the 16 or is it part of that?
SPEAKER_01: No, no, part of that.
SPEAKER_00: Part of them.
SPEAKER_01: So that's exactly the end of 13 euros without the state of ignition.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Well, if you have new more ideas, we can add new more, some more keys if you want to, you know.
SPEAKER_00: I think that, yeah, we should stick with a number of keys because if we add too much then.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's not a bit clattering up everything.
SPEAKER_02: What is this one on the side?
SPEAKER_02: That's what it's kind of a LED for indicating your battery.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And as well as it's like a blinking one and keep it the same.
SPEAKER_01: Like the shape of them.
SPEAKER_01: I do like them.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The size and the shape.
SPEAKER_05: Before talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible, maybe.
SPEAKER_05: And you can give us your.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products, both of these two.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, the evaluation and also the evaluation criteria.
SPEAKER_05: So what is important to look at?
SPEAKER_01: Best guess what we've talked about already.
SPEAKER_01: From the marketing point of view, we just want to make sure that we've taken into account.
SPEAKER_05: Well, just do it quickly if we all already.
SPEAKER_01: So it's just a short list of criteria on the things that we identified as being important to selling the product.
SPEAKER_01: We just go through these and rate them as a group.
SPEAKER_01: And at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that.
SPEAKER_01: So just average the score of those items.
SPEAKER_01: So these are things we identified as being important.
SPEAKER_01: They show the three things we're looking to feel innovation and ease of use.
SPEAKER_01: The three important components.
SPEAKER_01: Appealing to the correct demographic.
SPEAKER_01: So using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic.
SPEAKER_01: And then following the company motto, following the fashion trends and putting the end to the product as well.
SPEAKER_01: So we'll do you want to go through and put through those on the two products now.
SPEAKER_01: I do want to discuss them further and then evaluate them.
SPEAKER_05: No, why not discuss it now?
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So I've just got to throw in whiteboard, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: So the first one was really very far below budget.
SPEAKER_01: Would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have a high profit on it?
SPEAKER_01: It was running a megabyte of the eight euros and we have a...
SPEAKER_05: Well, my personal view is when this one is eight euros, we must think how can we improve it.
SPEAKER_05: And then I mean, you must just see it as we can still spend this for half a euro.
SPEAKER_05: And because the selling price is already quite fixed on 25 euros.
SPEAKER_05: So we just have to offer as much as value for the customer he can have for 25 euro.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, it's looking pale in a fashion.
SPEAKER_01: Come on.
SPEAKER_02: Generative, easy to use.
SPEAKER_00: Easy to use.
SPEAKER_00: And trends.
SPEAKER_01: Are we following the idea of using the removal covers on this?
SPEAKER_01: Is that part of both them?
SPEAKER_05: We can still discuss that.
SPEAKER_05: And together with evaluating this, we might come with new ideas in adding things or removing options because they are expensive.
SPEAKER_05: But I've received a framework which we can do this.
SPEAKER_05: I mean, did you have this Excel sheet?
SPEAKER_05: No.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, this is the latest price of our production unit for several components.
SPEAKER_05: So we can see whether the price is within the twelve euros or fifty cents.
SPEAKER_05: So maybe we can start with this calling this one.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so that's the thing.
SPEAKER_05: This is the first design.
SPEAKER_01: I think that one's green.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so look and feel where one is a brick and a pentagon.
SPEAKER_01: There is another pentagon.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, get that one.
SPEAKER_01: One's bad and seven's the best.
SPEAKER_01: So one's true and seven's false.
SPEAKER_01: One's the best.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So I'll scale one to seven.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, so look and feel.
SPEAKER_05: Well, you already feel it pretty much, I think.
SPEAKER_02: Sounds good.
SPEAKER_05: In my opinion, if you really feel, it's very good.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: It's very good in your hand.
SPEAKER_05: So I would consider two or maybe even one for feel.
SPEAKER_05: That's just half.
SPEAKER_05: We should also consider look.
SPEAKER_05: And then it looks quite conventional.
SPEAKER_05: Don't you agree?
SPEAKER_01: On the scale, between functional and fancy.
SPEAKER_01: They're looking at it.
SPEAKER_05: It's a safe five.
SPEAKER_02: It's my opinion, but I don't know what to give it to me.
SPEAKER_02: We have a very, very designed, it's like the surf.
SPEAKER_02: As we say, you know, it does look is fine, but still I would give four in that case.
SPEAKER_02: Four.
SPEAKER_05: Four, yeah.
SPEAKER_05: What other than that?
SPEAKER_02: We should love four.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I would give, yeah.
None: That's not.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Can you maybe fix the other?
SPEAKER_00: No, you should pray like this, not like this, or new.
SPEAKER_02: No, it can't get the batteries.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, the battery has fallen down.
SPEAKER_01: The battery is not the ink.
SPEAKER_01: That's the, that one.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So that's it.
SPEAKER_02: But no, no, it's not that it's yet to close the battery.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: No, it should be.
SPEAKER_01: No, I think it's lost a battery.
SPEAKER_01: I'm trying to try it.
SPEAKER_01: No, it's still right, but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors.
SPEAKER_02: Is that another battery there?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You got it, sir.
SPEAKER_01: Try it.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, we got better tell.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, it is.
SPEAKER_05: Perfect.
SPEAKER_00: Perfect.
SPEAKER_01: Is that working?
SPEAKER_01: Did it come out?
SPEAKER_05: Good.
SPEAKER_01: Good.
SPEAKER_01: Because we'd be able to see it still even if it wasn't working.
SPEAKER_01: It's just no whiteboard marker.
SPEAKER_01: But it wouldn't be picked up in the actual whiteboard.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So, then, then.
SPEAKER_01: The other one?
None: Wow.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's slightly better.
SPEAKER_01: The side shelf must have seen.
SPEAKER_05: But when we want to include, I'm doubting about this component.
SPEAKER_05: It breaks in your game.
SPEAKER_02: No, actually, this is not going to approach you actually.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: It's not a button, it's a lead.
SPEAKER_02: It's a lead actually, which will be coming in a code.
SPEAKER_00: Actually, yeah, it should be embedded.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, embedded that.
SPEAKER_00: It won't be really, you know, you can push it again.
SPEAKER_00: You can push it again.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The other thing is it's left hand one protruding because if people are left handed, then one needs other hand.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It works so well.
SPEAKER_02: No, it's not protruding actually.
SPEAKER_02: You just go embedded into that.
SPEAKER_01: I'd say two or three for that one, personally.
SPEAKER_01: What was three than two?
SPEAKER_05: I think the look is better, but the feel is worse.
SPEAKER_05: So I would also say this is four.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: But do you think?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, it's fine, I think.
SPEAKER_02: No, just that the feel is that you, right now you don't see that feel because I don't find them, but if you place it quite inside, now like this, now it's embedded one.
SPEAKER_02: This is how the embedded one is.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's basically the same thing actually.
SPEAKER_02: You'll be, except that in this.
SPEAKER_02: And the very CD makes it better.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And you may have a slight thing for it to follow.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's definitely more fancy than that one.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_00: I would say two or three.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So it consensus two or three?
SPEAKER_01: Two or three.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, two or three.
SPEAKER_05: Two or three.
None: Two or three.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, two or three.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Innovation.
SPEAKER_01: The first one.
SPEAKER_00: No, I think there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But except for the design of the stuff.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The stuff.
SPEAKER_01: What species are actually including, including like a location kind of thing?
SPEAKER_01: I try to find it.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's one of the feel.
SPEAKER_01: But there's no actual innovation in that at all.
SPEAKER_01: It's just a straight-out remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: The only innovation is to shape.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So there's no, that's a looking field thing that was not a technical innovation.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So I'd be up to seven for innovation.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And the second one is really a state of the art.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: In terms of innovation.
SPEAKER_00: And with many more functionalities, you can open and impose the.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it is.
SPEAKER_05: But a lot of LCD screens.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: That's, that's, well, quite an all of the squaring, uh, buttons and menu and a programmable device behind this.
SPEAKER_00: Uh, it could be that one or two.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Persona.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So what does the innovation, this got the LCD screen?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Automatically switch recognition.
SPEAKER_01: Is that in this one now?
SPEAKER_01: Is this because this is the no, no, two different options we discussed then.
SPEAKER_01: We discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget.
SPEAKER_05: We just discussed this as you would design it and then we'll try to.
SPEAKER_01: So the cost for the is what was the cost for the first one?
SPEAKER_01: Eight.
SPEAKER_01: Eight.
SPEAKER_00: Actually, we have, yeah, to check again.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And this one was 16 years.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So innovation for this one is two.
SPEAKER_01: One.
SPEAKER_02: That's all they would say to.
SPEAKER_00: One to be one.
SPEAKER_00: What would we do in it?
SPEAKER_00: Actually, I don't see.
SPEAKER_00: Why?
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: One would be without a button.
SPEAKER_01: Am I?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Well, this speech recognition is a very good innovation.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So maybe with the speech recognition, it's using speech recognition.
SPEAKER_05: Well, given that the works, yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Then it's I think one.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Is it used?
SPEAKER_00: So the first one is restandard so everybody can use it.
SPEAKER_00: It's used to it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, used to it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So that's maybe a two phrase of use.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So the one is quite easy.
SPEAKER_00: So though.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Though it has more functionality, I think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually.
SPEAKER_01: So maybe a three or four.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Actually, in fact, I think it will be.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe sometimes people get scared with the number of buttons.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And there's like I would say three or four.
SPEAKER_02: Well, we have reduced the key actually.
SPEAKER_02: Three or four.
SPEAKER_02: Three.
SPEAKER_02: Three is fine.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Because it's not like a big one with a 100 buttons.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Actually, the user has to put some effort to do use that actually.
SPEAKER_02: It's not so easy like this one than normal.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: But then when when he used to it, it's quite easy.
SPEAKER_05: It's quite easy.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Initially there is a lot of effort.
SPEAKER_05: Good.
SPEAKER_01: What's the next?
SPEAKER_01: Three.
SPEAKER_01: How well it goes to the target demographic.
SPEAKER_01: So it was still thinking 20 to 40 year olds.
SPEAKER_00: 20 to 40.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: This one would be for one mother.
SPEAKER_02: No, this one I would give this model to the whole people.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, one mother.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So it's completely changed our demographic there.
SPEAKER_01: It's not part of the funky young thing.
SPEAKER_01: Well, except for the surfing shape.
SPEAKER_05: I mean, that's something with as an appeal on this group.
SPEAKER_01: I think.
SPEAKER_01: It's a very bottom price range.
SPEAKER_01: It was like between this and another one, which did the same thing.
SPEAKER_01: Then I can imagine it being a piling for the demographic, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But it's still.
SPEAKER_05: We offer this.
SPEAKER_05: We can consider, for instance, making this more attractive to the demographic.
SPEAKER_01: So I've got room, but some budget there to add a few things to it.
SPEAKER_05: But as it is now, I say, six.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
None: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Do you agree?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, because it's so important.
SPEAKER_00: It was written that it was so important, the look and taking care of it.
SPEAKER_00: It targets the right range of people.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but very easily in the market, it's going to be cheap, actually.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But it's going to be cheap, whatever though.
SPEAKER_01: It was set with it.
SPEAKER_02: It can still decide to use it to be providing.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Instead of it.
SPEAKER_00: But for us, we have a constraint that we need to set at 25 euros.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: There's nothing that would make me spend an extra few euros and that one rather than other one.
SPEAKER_05: There's 25 euros.
SPEAKER_05: I mean, it's not going to be cheaper.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so in that case, well, it's fine.
SPEAKER_01: And the demographic of the second one?
SPEAKER_02: The demographic.
SPEAKER_02: It's got the toys in it.
SPEAKER_01: It's got the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_05: And that I think it's better because of the LCD screen, which really don't feel on the YEP sign on the...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: If you want to target, if we wish to sell four millions of this, I think for these agents, we need absolutely the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_05: So the LCD screen attracts...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think especially if we can have an LCD screen and a low range product, and that's good.
SPEAKER_05: Maybe just something to consider.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So what...
SPEAKER_01: I probably got this three again for that one.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think it's...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, you're right.
SPEAKER_02: It has more market actually.
SPEAKER_00: Even one and two.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you're right.
SPEAKER_01: So two.
SPEAKER_02: Two and two.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Because tomorrow, this will be more appealing because you can add a lot of investigation on that.
SPEAKER_02: Because then you have it...
SPEAKER_02: You have a lot of things which you can include for the people.
SPEAKER_01: And especially I guess this is the speech recognition as well.
SPEAKER_01: And that makes it more appealing, more of a new fun toy.
SPEAKER_02: We have to practically test it.
SPEAKER_02: The field test will tell you how good.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, you find a point.
SPEAKER_01: And the trends.
SPEAKER_01: So the trends were the Britain vegetables and the spongy feel.
SPEAKER_01: So as it is, not really doing either of them.
SPEAKER_00: I think spongy... that means it goes in the water.
SPEAKER_01: Well, spongy could be part of the field of the buttons as well.
SPEAKER_01: And I have some...
SPEAKER_01: Have you tried them by well-fung?
SPEAKER_01: They've got the kind of spongy buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Not exactly spongy, but...
SPEAKER_01: I'm thinking one of the not key is it's got like...
SPEAKER_01: You can't...
SPEAKER_01: You've got individual buttons.
SPEAKER_01: It's got just one bit on it.
SPEAKER_01: And so you can...
SPEAKER_01: That feels kind of spongy.
SPEAKER_00: This one includes this feature, right?
SPEAKER_00: Spongy buttons.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, sort of...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, so they're going to be...
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: And maybe in the coro we can make it...
SPEAKER_00: Fruit and veggie.
SPEAKER_01: Well, that's if you use in the covers.
SPEAKER_05: Or is it...
SPEAKER_05: Yes.
SPEAKER_05: We can consider...
SPEAKER_05: Is it possible, do you think, to make a cover for such a phone?
SPEAKER_01: Well, they're back up in my walls.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if I do want to cover that, actually.
SPEAKER_05: Just with a flexible plastic...
SPEAKER_01: So you've got the option of having different colors or different textures.
SPEAKER_01: This is possible.
SPEAKER_02: Is it...
SPEAKER_02: Are you sure?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think it should be possible, like, what we do with them all the time.
SPEAKER_05: Or just two things which can be put on each other.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I do like Nokia.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: I do like it.
SPEAKER_05: Hi.
SPEAKER_05: So...
SPEAKER_05: Maybe we can...
SPEAKER_05: But we have to decide that we can put the...
SPEAKER_05: Offensive look of vegetables, for instance, to these coffers.
SPEAKER_05: And now try to invest in the features.
SPEAKER_01: I think that if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in electronics, it lets you find the latest fashion.
SPEAKER_01: Even next year when Frinnbisch was not beat up, you'll still be able to put a new cover on it.
SPEAKER_00: And then it'll still be in fashion.
SPEAKER_00: Because sometimes look at this computer.
SPEAKER_00: It's all black.
SPEAKER_00: And it's quite conventional.
SPEAKER_00: Sometimes people don't like too much flashy colors.
SPEAKER_00: Like there's some presented here.
SPEAKER_00: So maybe we could do...
SPEAKER_00: Like in the range, the set of what we propose a black one.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: The wrist-tun-dot one.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: That meets the requirements of such people that want to really stand out in things.
SPEAKER_01: And then you have the option of having different colors.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So that would make the trends equal. So we really have done that.
SPEAKER_01: There's a picture that could be included in either of them.
SPEAKER_01: Although it is more with the Spandy buttons on the...
SPEAKER_01: Yes, no.
SPEAKER_00:...and it's a point better for the...
SPEAKER_00: Okay, sorry.
SPEAKER_01: Two and three or one or two?
SPEAKER_05: Yes.
SPEAKER_05: Yes.
SPEAKER_05: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Say one, two.
SPEAKER_05: One, two.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, by that.
SPEAKER_05: So this one has Sponsy buttons.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, it says this.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it says this.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, so the average of that is...
SPEAKER_01:...three, six, nine, about five.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_05: Do you have a size of one?
SPEAKER_01: One by six, one by six.
SPEAKER_01: No, by five, one points, eight.
SPEAKER_02: One by eight, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: This one, 11, 13, 19, 21.
SPEAKER_01: Five is 4.2.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, 1.2.
SPEAKER_00: Very good.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: But it's two of the very different price of those two.
SPEAKER_01: So they're not really comparable, yeah, anyway.
SPEAKER_05: We must try to get them close to...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05:...both in eight.
SPEAKER_05: Or we just have to choose and adapt.
SPEAKER_05: Because when we choose for this one, we have to...
SPEAKER_05: We have to make it more attractive.
SPEAKER_05: And when we choose for this one, we have to make it more cheap.
SPEAKER_01: So it's easy to make that one cheap, but by just taking this bit of recognition out, that will basically take us down to the budget.
SPEAKER_05: But now, did you work with the same price as I have here?
SPEAKER_00: So I give, yeah, I just give it cool with the money picture and I expand them.
SPEAKER_00: And they told me this could be possible for us to see in euros.
SPEAKER_00: Unfortunately, we didn't see this shit.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Matthew, so maybe we have to recap with this one.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe we have to reconsider everything with this, yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Well, yes, well, reconsider it.
SPEAKER_05: So let's try to model this one in this heat.
SPEAKER_05: What kind of energy source we didn't speak about yet.
SPEAKER_05: It's a normal battery or...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it'll need more than a commercial one.
SPEAKER_02: It won't be a...
SPEAKER_02: Maybe you might use an AA battery actually.
SPEAKER_02: What do you say, Maya?
SPEAKER_00: For this one, it's a normal battery.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, it's a 1 battery.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Electronics.
SPEAKER_05: I'll give it a speech recognition.
SPEAKER_05: I think you should go for your fans cheap.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Some birds.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, or sample sense, or yes?
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, this one.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, this one.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So, double cloud, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's a high sea.
SPEAKER_05: Double-carves.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's going to be more than just the basic case, definitely.
SPEAKER_00: So which one are we talking to?
SPEAKER_02: How are you talking about this, that one?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, we are talking about it.
SPEAKER_05: But they have the same shape.
SPEAKER_01: The boat can be not basic cases.
SPEAKER_05: So this would be double-carves?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: A plastic would be a...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, the basic one.
SPEAKER_05: Terrible.
SPEAKER_00: Zero-french.
SPEAKER_02: Special cover.
SPEAKER_05: Special color, now we leave to the covers.
SPEAKER_01: So now we're going bush button or LCD display?
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: I said this, but yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It's okay.
SPEAKER_00: Let's say LCD display.
SPEAKER_01: Is that price per unit or for the whole?
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, then this is per unit.
SPEAKER_05: So, number of components.
SPEAKER_02: So, we made need a scroll, we'll write for that.
SPEAKER_02: No, for this one.
SPEAKER_02: No, for that one also.
SPEAKER_00: The author.
SPEAKER_00: So, yeah, that's a scroll.
SPEAKER_05: One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, eight, nine.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, well, probably.
SPEAKER_05: So this comes to 18.
SPEAKER_01: And that's without any special button supplements.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, one scroll will leave me.
SPEAKER_02: I don't really know what I've made.
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_01: So we had special color, special form, special material, and all of them.
SPEAKER_01: Don't understand about this.
SPEAKER_05: So, I think...
SPEAKER_05: But did we agree that it's...
SPEAKER_00: It's not double curved, it's single curved, right?
SPEAKER_00: Because there is no...
SPEAKER_01: But I thought it would be curved on two.
SPEAKER_01: So it's curved on the sides and curved on the top of the button as well.
SPEAKER_04: And the time that's...
SPEAKER_04: Oh.
SPEAKER_00: Well...
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I know this.
SPEAKER_00: I don't expect what it means.
SPEAKER_00: This...
SPEAKER_00: There is only...
SPEAKER_00: There is nothing like...
SPEAKER_00: You know, in the other stuff...
SPEAKER_00: You talk about concave?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, concave.
SPEAKER_00: So I think we can put...
SPEAKER_01: You think it's single curved?
SPEAKER_00: It's single curved, like 16.
SPEAKER_00: That makes 17.
SPEAKER_00: And what else?
SPEAKER_00: The buttons we have tried buttons, are you sure?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: We have more, we've got the scroll on the side.
SPEAKER_00: The bad...
SPEAKER_00: Bad estimation.
SPEAKER_05: We even talk about the LED, but that's not...
SPEAKER_05: The LED is very inexpensive, I believe, but it's not in the list.
SPEAKER_01: We've got a scroll wheel for the volume, don't we?
SPEAKER_01: Or is it some other thing that's not on there?
SPEAKER_05: If this is a scroll wheel or if this is a sort of button, which can be pressed on two sides, so for...
SPEAKER_05: Iron areas.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, we've only got five minutes left, guys.
SPEAKER_01: Let's drop it up pretty fast.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, you can.
SPEAKER_00: Score the wheel.
SPEAKER_01: So this is even more than the...
SPEAKER_01: In the costume game, the 16-year-olds?
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so based on that, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Where is the...
SPEAKER_02: Speed Journal.
SPEAKER_05: That is the sample sensor and the sample speaker.
SPEAKER_00: So...
SPEAKER_02: We just need that, actually.
SPEAKER_02: Where...
SPEAKER_02: We need one.
SPEAKER_05: We could go for a simple chip, but then we can have the...
SPEAKER_05: Speed Track Nation, yes?
SPEAKER_00: No, we cannot, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So when we...
SPEAKER_05: But this would be cutting the Speed Track Nation.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but if you have the near-the-LCD, you can select between...
SPEAKER_00: Universal between audio, TV and VCR.
SPEAKER_00: And this needs an advanced chip.
SPEAKER_00: Trans-tip.
SPEAKER_00: Right.
SPEAKER_00: Hi.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, are you a chip?
SPEAKER_02: I think it's going to be...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we can do that.
SPEAKER_05: With the regular chip, yeah.
SPEAKER_05: I can do that.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, still on 15, so.
SPEAKER_00: So...
SPEAKER_00: And what about the number of buttons?
SPEAKER_05: Yes, that may be...
SPEAKER_05: Well, we can just say...
SPEAKER_04: Matthew.
SPEAKER_00: When you look at this...
SPEAKER_00: This item.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, we're just...
SPEAKER_05: When we just want to cut the number of buttons, we have to make 7 to fit in 12, 12, 15.
SPEAKER_05: So is it possible?
SPEAKER_01: The 7 basic buttons, or 7 buttons that any adds on with a special colors or for more material.
SPEAKER_02: Then we have to ask the user to place itself.
SPEAKER_00: You're going to make a phone to your boss saying, 2050 is really...
SPEAKER_00: No, no.
SPEAKER_01: So, the LCD plays is three francs.
SPEAKER_01: It's very three-year-olds by itself.
SPEAKER_00: And we don't want to change that right.
SPEAKER_00: We really want to add city, otherwise we would not get the market.
SPEAKER_00: Otherwise, everything...
SPEAKER_05: You are a very normal thing like this.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So, 12 euro 50.
SPEAKER_01: We got two off of the battery.
SPEAKER_01: We can't do anything about that.
SPEAKER_01: So, 1050.
SPEAKER_01: So, what else do you display?
SPEAKER_01: Display. That's 750.
SPEAKER_01: So, we've got 750 to use for the case and for the buttons.
SPEAKER_01: And the chips.
SPEAKER_01: So, the chips.
SPEAKER_04: Up there already.
SPEAKER_01: So, we're going to scale this down to get within budget.
SPEAKER_01: There's no doubt about that.
SPEAKER_00: So, what each other's thinking about the...
SPEAKER_00: Because it's a major point in the LCD.
SPEAKER_00: Do you think it's important?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, we could even replace them by buttons.
SPEAKER_00: Because sometimes when you watch the TV, in fact, you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more on your hands.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know. I'm just asking.
SPEAKER_02: It depends what kind of functionality you want to add into it.
SPEAKER_02: For example, if you add two more functionality, then better you add two more buttons there.
SPEAKER_02: Instead of LCD display.
SPEAKER_02: Which is going to bring the cost by two.
SPEAKER_01: Unless we can really drive these prices down, we need to get rid of the LCD display.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so we can get rid of it and then add a couple of buttons.
SPEAKER_02: We want that.
SPEAKER_00: On the market point of view, what do you think LCD is a major feature?
SPEAKER_01: For the price, it's going to be what we can afford.
SPEAKER_01: And it's looking like we can't afford the LCD display.
SPEAKER_01: There's no way we can get it in there.
SPEAKER_05: I think we have to come to the decision now.
SPEAKER_05: I think what we just do is fold about the LCD display.
SPEAKER_00: You assume you want a democracy voice.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_05: One man in one world.
SPEAKER_05: So who thinks the LCD display would be in it?
SPEAKER_01: I'd like to be in, but I can't see it happening.
SPEAKER_01: I think we could.
SPEAKER_01: You're a power voter of beta anyway as project manager.
SPEAKER_02: But the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that?
SPEAKER_01: Well, we have to make decision now.
SPEAKER_05: So having an LCD display is just have very limited amount of buttons.
SPEAKER_05: Is that acceptable?
SPEAKER_05: Can you function to be implemented?
SPEAKER_05: Yes.
SPEAKER_05: You agree.
SPEAKER_05: So having seven buttons instead of 12.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So it would be cutting, cutting, say about these buttons.
SPEAKER_00: Because one, yeah, show me that.
SPEAKER_00: Actually, we could, in fact, remove these three buttons and have three possibilities for each of the three here.
SPEAKER_00: Here one at the middle and at the bottom.
SPEAKER_01: I think we're really losing ease of use.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: That really could be another problem for the people to use it.
SPEAKER_02: It's not going to be easy.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So I think we should, we should cut the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_05: That's my opinion.
SPEAKER_05: No, it's okay.
SPEAKER_02: You cut the LCD screen and introduce two more buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So LCD is out.
SPEAKER_01: The speech record now?
SPEAKER_00: The speech recognition is out.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Where else?
SPEAKER_00: Because of the budget.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Now we can just...
SPEAKER_01: So are we basically back to the original one now?
SPEAKER_01: Back to the first version.
SPEAKER_01: Which turns out to be on budget exactly pretty much.
SPEAKER_01: With these new costings.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: So just look at, forget that one and look at that one now.
SPEAKER_05: Yes.
SPEAKER_05: Yes.
SPEAKER_05: I think we just go for this one.
SPEAKER_05: That now 12 euros is there.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: It's the price.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So we glad that it's 50 cents cheaper than actually.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So we don't need really expert designers.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Because they're home.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So we can go back and talk to the suppliers and they'll see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in.
SPEAKER_01: But that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Good.
SPEAKER_05: Then we have for this hang.
SPEAKER_04: Thank you.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: That was it.
SPEAKER_04: That's it.
None: Thanks.
None: Cool.
None: Okay.
None: Uh-oh.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Find the design
