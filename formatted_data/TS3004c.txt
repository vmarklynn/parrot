SPEAKER_03: Pala runda...i was one of them
SPEAKER_04: ok
SPEAKER_03: c'mon check, check, check why won't it wake up is it done?
None: ok power that doesn't work you turn it off
SPEAKER_03: but how? no, there it is
SPEAKER_01: ok
SPEAKER_02: i received an email with a few possibilities on the materials so i will discuss them ok, we just need to go on to the back later
SPEAKER_03: yeah, i received it so we are going to talk about the conceptual model which one was mine?
SPEAKER_01: so that's me ok, so ok, so i will show you the the minute what's it called?
SPEAKER_01: ok, so we just talked about the you want me to show it there?
SPEAKER_01: no ok, we just talked about it looks it's a nice usability people don't want to spend money on something similar to cheaper ones it has to be very basic not too many buttons light switches on if you use a button text TV still has to be a possibility and it has to be easy to learn what are the things i make and the functions are full human channel to choose channels on the off mute button and the text TV button that are the functions that's right?
SPEAKER_01: yes, that's ok so i just want to give you a mic again the first presentation of your
SPEAKER_04: channel i start ok, well i received an email ok i search the web and i search on this document we sent investigation of the remote control market it has been done in italy and in another country in Europe i forget it but they found out the most important respect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look and feel instead of the current functional look and feel so it's very important for us to create something new so what michael just said it must be some very different from ordinary remote controls fancy stands for an original look and feel of the case and interface this aspect is the most important one it came out of the research and as the following the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological innovative and that stands for new technical features and then this is a point of discussion because we just decided that we don't make use of LCD or speech recognition but this is the second important aspect and i think we must use some of the new technology to be innovative
SPEAKER_01: we already have the flashing light on it maybe some new
SPEAKER_04: we have to discuss about it
SPEAKER_00: okay
SPEAKER_04: tell us which that do not exist in current remote controls and that's very hard i think the third one is the aspect that the remote controls should be easy to use but that was an overall point we already discussed that i've got one picture our target group we thought about was Jo and Trendy so i took that part of the webpage and it says fashion watches of very friends in it i have detected the following trends this trend i think it's not that meaningful for us maybe but it's about close and shoes but the next aspect also in contrast to last year the field of material is expected to be spongy spongy spongy
SPEAKER_02: okay so rubber
SPEAKER_01: soft material it's definitely a good idea because you drop your remote control very often on the ground so it has to be
SPEAKER_04: flexible it's something that it's stand there i didn't knew what it means so spongy means like a sponge it's also a stress ball it's a good idea
SPEAKER_01: it's like that it's the bit like the the borders of the remote control or soft
SPEAKER_02: yeah i have some material information but i will give you it later okay in my presentation
SPEAKER_04: okay what do i think because a fancy look is the most important thing for remote control i think about changeable fronts maybe i see through one in a fruit front because it's it's hot and some basic color fronts so we can make five different fronts to start with or something maybe an extraordinary shape like a sponge or yeah just another shape then a normal remote control has just something rounds in it or maybe not yeah i don't know we have to discuss about that yeah main point still the technological innovative how do we do that? maybe speech we must have some kind of gadget
SPEAKER_03: yeah i'll get back on that
SPEAKER_01: it's very difficult to do it because it's only 12.5 euros
SPEAKER_03: you have to spend yeah that's the problem also an email from
SPEAKER_04: the technology department
SPEAKER_03: maybe watch the first even more possibilities now with speech so they recommend it using it
SPEAKER_04: okay let's check what it first watch
SPEAKER_02: we have don't have an idea how much it's gone
SPEAKER_03: and cost maybe cheap and they don't say how much it's gone so if we implement its mass production i think it would be better to implement LCD as well since you have to configure
SPEAKER_01: speech
SPEAKER_03: that's definitely more expensive than
SPEAKER_04: yeah that's something i don't know we're going to make many of those so we can start a mass production and then we still will be
SPEAKER_01: but the telephones also have an LCD and it's about 200 euros
SPEAKER_00: we have to decide
SPEAKER_04: okay that was this
SPEAKER_03: no
SPEAKER_02: i got an email and it says the chip can be simple, regular, or advanced and they say a display requires an advanced chip and this is more expensive than all the other chips so
SPEAKER_03: the most expensive
SPEAKER_02: it says an email the display requires an advanced chip
SPEAKER_03: and speech or good yes probably
SPEAKER_02: i haven't got anything about speech recognition
SPEAKER_03: but
SPEAKER_02: that's the most expensive chip we need if we do
SPEAKER_03: we can make a sort of a design so i did some searching on the internet what's the old remote control and new remote control i think we should this is one of the modern remote controls of the moment i think we should go more to the iPod and
SPEAKER_01: amperee players
SPEAKER_03: mobafon you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller because when you're going to control it you can see it here you have to be able to reach both sides and you just have one few buttons so that's the main difference i definitely think we should go like this and then change both so that's the most important part i think a bit on the home basis something like that something simple well and then i just ordered the buttons a bit basic buttons on off mute and maybe two others so i don't think i don't think it fits in the modern stream as well and then where you saw the display in the iPod you can put the basic buttons 1,2,3,4 and above 10 and i think on the display no no there's no display there but it's on the place of the display and i think we should light this up much more than that part so the focus is on these two parts so you don't see all the buttons you
SPEAKER_01: else but this one is very difficult to use because the volume and channel is on the bottom so you can use your thumb for it this is how it is now
SPEAKER_03: here well well it's volume i think it's on on the bottom
SPEAKER_02: i think it's on on the bottom but it's not the best
SPEAKER_03: well the yearly FL so side scrolls i don't know if you can use that yeah i've got something on that for volume or a channel well then we can even simplify it more by just putting the volume on the side and just channel buttons here
SPEAKER_02: maybe the channel buttons are often used and you can use them now with your thumb because the thing is not well easy to use
SPEAKER_03: well control basically as
SPEAKER_02: here maybe we should put that on top
SPEAKER_01: but as we don't use on any buttons just put that on the bottom
SPEAKER_02: because you can't hold it
SPEAKER_01: you can't hold it and push the buttons
SPEAKER_03: okay well yeah
SPEAKER_02: well i think you use the switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons like one, two, three so maybe we can put that on the bottom
SPEAKER_03: maybe i don't know well
SPEAKER_02: like zapping is just switch
SPEAKER_03: maybe it's not easy if it's below it's harder to zep so i think it should be to be easy to help i think it's pretty standard these row buttons on the top if you don't light them up you don't seem very good i think it's modern to light this area up and to light this area up so the focus gets on this part and not on there okay but the position of course can be different we have to look at what's easy to use so we can switch these to i don't know if it will look good if you put those on the bottom
SPEAKER_02: no i think the top buttons are okay they should be on top
SPEAKER_03: maybe we can switch those and you have to make sure it's easy to test to be big enough so you can heal well that's my findings so my personal opinions that we should go more modern look and play and well if you want to put in speak recognition or something i don't think we should put it on top then i think that if you're going to put in more technology you need to be able to switch it open to use so if you put in speech recognition you need so many more buttons which won't look good on the front side i think no so that's something we have to decide
SPEAKER_02: yeah we have to keep it simple
SPEAKER_01: yeah we have to decide this lecture or this i think we have to do it for 20 minutes
None: yeah i think we're just going to look okay the component design
None: i looked at some similar devices and my own common knowledge so this was on the website if you aim at a young public you should use materials in our soft with primary colors like green, blue, red so fleshy kind of colors shapes should be curved so round shapes nothing square like okay so okay
SPEAKER_01: your iPod is trendy
SPEAKER_03: it is no curved square yeah but it has round corners
SPEAKER_02: i think so we shouldn't have two square corners in that class yeah
SPEAKER_03: and
SPEAKER_02: sports and gaming divine style characteristics i don't know exactly what that means it should be well yeah popular kind of
SPEAKER_01: yeah we have to put our real reaction logo as well on the remote control so the colors also we have the hate make it in black black yellow
SPEAKER_02: black yellow
SPEAKER_01: maybe the size yellow and the top black
SPEAKER_02: not that weird because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy to attract a young public
SPEAKER_03: yeah but i don't think the colors black and yellow go well together no
SPEAKER_01: maybe that's a yellow on the side and black on the front
SPEAKER_02: that's just a matter of taste yeah okay we have to use kind of fleshy colors
SPEAKER_03: we can't use different fronts with all with the logo on it yeah we do that
SPEAKER_02: like front in red and yellow
SPEAKER_01: blue and so it's still transparent
SPEAKER_03: yeah but with all with logo on it
SPEAKER_02: well this is a remote control a very old one and then the components the case just the here's black
SPEAKER_01: maybe we have to make it from soft material yeah i don't know
SPEAKER_02: maybe but anyways it should be transparent we decided that
SPEAKER_03: well one of the options you can just like a mobile phone you can make a okay yeah we could do that
SPEAKER_01: or just give five with them
SPEAKER_03: just in the box
SPEAKER_02: yeah you could make them like blue and transparent with the buttons normal rubber i think like normal ordinary buttons
SPEAKER_01: soft it could be like a Nokia
SPEAKER_03: with a hard hard button rubber really has an old look
SPEAKER_04: okay the new modern remote controls the buttons are part of the style i think it's part of the remote control itself questsken en ser gyareduna onwon qué Swirl
SPEAKER_02: so in one level
SPEAKER_03: the topics
SPEAKER_02: yeah – OK, so that should be hard plastic than the buttons?
SPEAKER_03: – I think or maybe… – I may be able to kind of material with this, but…
SPEAKER_01: – Yeah. – Maybe you can make it around platform soft material, just only the basic remote control from normal plastic and the rounds of it from softers.
SPEAKER_02: – OK. – Yeah. – And then the LED, the normal infrared LED, I think, sufficient and backlight LEDs. – Cool. – But I think we have to make the case transparent, otherwise the backlight won't work.
SPEAKER_02: – So if you put… – Yeah, you can use… – The number of the buttons. – Yeah, that's right.
SPEAKER_02: – Or it runs the whole… – Yeah, but we can still make it transparent.
SPEAKER_03: – So, hey, can you turn it on? – Half transparent or just that it comes out a bit?
SPEAKER_02: – OK. And in green color, the backlight or difference? – I think also.
SPEAKER_03: – Yeah. – Blue. – Blue, red, whatever you want, I think, depends on the color.
SPEAKER_01: – Yeah, but you can't choose when you buy it. – Yeah, that's true.
SPEAKER_02: – Now, I think there are multiple color LEDs. So… – Yeah, but can you change the filter? – I know, I know.
SPEAKER_03: – I think it's more important to control it. – Yeah, OK. Maybe it's more important.
SPEAKER_02: – It's more expensive. – I think it's better to say that.
SPEAKER_03: – I have a blinking light on my phone and I can change the color of it.
SPEAKER_01: – OK, cool. Just make it some different colors, blue, red and green.
SPEAKER_02: – Yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's too expensive, but… – Well, I don't think so.
SPEAKER_03: – I put in any fancy technology yet.
SPEAKER_02: – Then some more technical things. I don't know what it is, but it should be there, I think.
SPEAKER_02: This is normal circuit board, like chip boards in a lot of things.
SPEAKER_02: – You have to hurry up a bit. – So we just need this and… – This transistors and resonators, this is all these kind of things.
SPEAKER_02: They basically said that that's almost the same on any remote control.
SPEAKER_02: So I guess we just need that. I don't know what they do.
SPEAKER_04: – OK, you can change. – Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: – Now, they just said we need it.
SPEAKER_02: The battery contacts, like normal batteries.
SPEAKER_01: – You can pick up a recharge, maybe. – Yeah, we still want to have a recharge, don't we?
SPEAKER_02: – Yeah, but we don't want to have a… how do you call it?
SPEAKER_02: – Akku. – Recharge.
SPEAKER_02: – Just batteries. – Rechargeable batteries.
SPEAKER_03: – Rechargeable batteries. – OK.
SPEAKER_02: – Not a separate… – No, just rechargeable batteries.
SPEAKER_02: – And a chip, that's this one.
SPEAKER_02: – I received some possibilities for the energy source.
SPEAKER_02: We can use batteries or a kinetic, like with the pulse watch.
SPEAKER_02: So it operates on your wrist.
SPEAKER_02: – OK. So if you want to… – Normally you put a remote control on the table or on the floor.
SPEAKER_02: – Yeah, I don't think it will work. And we can also use solar cells, but you mostly use it indoors.
SPEAKER_02: – This battery, that's cheaper. – Yeah, and we can use the home station kind of thing.
SPEAKER_02: – In cases, flat, so uncurved. 2D curved is like front to the back.
SPEAKER_02: And 3D curved is also in depth. – OK.
SPEAKER_02: – So that's possible. But with 3D curved, we must control, we must use rubber buttons.
SPEAKER_02: So we can use the flat. – So we need 2D.
SPEAKER_02: – Yeah, I think. – Definitely. – These kind of materials can be used?
SPEAKER_01: – It doesn't really matter, we just make it plastic. – Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: – I think so too. – Scroll wheels, that's cool, that's for the volume.
SPEAKER_02: – Yeah, scroll wheels. – Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: – Yeah, that's good.
SPEAKER_02: – We can use multiple scroll wheels, too, if we want to, but I think just the volume is enough.
SPEAKER_03: – I think for channels, it's not handy. – OK.
SPEAKER_02: – Scroll, fast. – And the LCD. So we need the most expensive chip if we use an LCD.
SPEAKER_01: – I don't think that's an opportunity. Just skip it, because we don't have time for that, too.
SPEAKER_02: – OK, then we use the second most expensive chips, so the regular chip, because we use scroll wheels.
SPEAKER_02: – Yeah. – OK.
SPEAKER_02: – And, yeah, that was it. – OK.
SPEAKER_02: – Are we using a rubber case or a side? – Maybe we have to skip that one as well, please.
SPEAKER_03: – I don't think it will be okay. – It should be soft.
SPEAKER_04: – It should be soft. – The trend is spongy and fruit or fresh.
SPEAKER_04: – Fresh. – And now we have nothing about those toes, too.
SPEAKER_03: – Fruit and fresh can be just the covers. – Yeah, just soft-flying the spongy.
SPEAKER_03: – Yeah, I don't know. I can't imagine. – No.
SPEAKER_03: – I don't like it to the neuter. – No. I just can't imagine.
SPEAKER_02: – So just hard plastic? – Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: – Titanium. It's mentioned there. – Titanium, I think, is too expensive.
SPEAKER_01: – Maybe the form has to be a bit different. Not the square form, just a bit.
SPEAKER_02: – Yeah, you can make it curved or round. – Or round.
SPEAKER_02: – But just in 2D, nothing depth. – Yeah, it's OK.
SPEAKER_01: So, if I have to decide which one to choose from these, what exactly?
SPEAKER_01: Because we have to know it. So the energy is 3 charge, if you already know that.
SPEAKER_01: – Yeah, that's right. – It's normal, that's free.
SPEAKER_01: – The chip on print is a normal one. – Yeah, the case is just a plastic one.
SPEAKER_02: – Yeah, the chip is the regular one. – Yeah, it's a simple one, regular and as fun.
SPEAKER_02: So it should be regular in this second.
SPEAKER_01: – I think I'll just check this. – And we need a plastic case with a scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: – I don't know, at least. – Yes.
SPEAKER_01: – That's pretty much it. – Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: – And the last thing. – And the last thing. – And the last thing.
SPEAKER_01: So, I'm not sure, but I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment.
SPEAKER_02: – I don't know what I do. – Or should we do it in the next meeting?
SPEAKER_03: – ID and UID work together on prototype drawing on smart boards.
SPEAKER_03: – Yeah, so we should get it here. – So we're staying here?
SPEAKER_01: – Sure, we're doing it in the next meeting. – I think that's the next meeting.
SPEAKER_01: – But you definitely get a specific instruction. – Okay, so I don't work for the minutes alone again.
SPEAKER_01: – But think about something that's more rounded and more... – Yeah, I didn't know, but iPod and etc.
SPEAKER_01: – And body prayer is mobile phones. – I bet just on the top floor.
SPEAKER_03: – This is a bit of a current man, okay. I'll see if I can see any events.
SPEAKER_01: – Maybe you can be like this, if you draw it like this.
SPEAKER_01: – Get it. – What the fuck is he?
SPEAKER_01: – Okay. Doesn't work. – You see what I mean?
SPEAKER_01: – If I draw here, what? – It draws about four centimeters over the neck.
SPEAKER_01: – Maybe you can make it like this.
SPEAKER_01: – And this is all the wheel for a volume, so that you just...
SPEAKER_01: – Just all round it, so you can do... – Like a very big scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: – Yeah, but just not on the top, but on the side of it. – Okay.
SPEAKER_01: – Maybe. I don't know. – Hmm.
SPEAKER_01: – Okay, so we just... – I have this at the moment.
SPEAKER_02: – I think you'll get a lot of volume changing when it's not wanted. – Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: – Okay, so we do have this. Is it okay? – Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: – I think it's probably better. – Probably better.
SPEAKER_02: – Yeah, but maybe we can make a plastic so that if you drop it, you won't change a volume.
SPEAKER_03: – Yeah, I know if you use something. – If you use something...
SPEAKER_03: – That's not square, but it's very easy.
SPEAKER_01: – Like this, and what's the channel to? Where do we put that?
SPEAKER_01: – I think in the middle. – The bottom, or?
SPEAKER_03: – Yeah, what is the middle part? – That's the numbers.
SPEAKER_02: – I think the numbers should be in the bottom, and the switch channel in the middle.
SPEAKER_02: – Yeah, I agree as well.
SPEAKER_01: – It doesn't make a difference if you put the switch channels on the side of each other, on the top of each other, because you already have the volume here.
SPEAKER_01: So you can also put it here, one but and the other one there.
SPEAKER_01: Next to each other.
SPEAKER_01: – Yeah, that's right. So you can also put it all on the top and this, keep this empty, because you have to hold it as well.
SPEAKER_02: – Or you could do the switch channel up button above the numbers,
SPEAKER_01: and switch channel down button below. – It doesn't need you to set it very quick.
SPEAKER_03: – I think it's the highest priority, and then you use those...
SPEAKER_01: – Is this an opportunity, or are you doing one thing?
SPEAKER_02: – Yeah, of course, sir. – I think we should put them on top of each other, so...
SPEAKER_02: – Yeah, because then it's easy to know if I push the...
SPEAKER_01: – But still the next one.
SPEAKER_02: – Yeah, but the top button is...
SPEAKER_02: is like you switch channel up, and down button is...
SPEAKER_01: – Yeah, but if you put them...
SPEAKER_02: – On the left, the right is exactly the same, but it doesn't make a big difference.
SPEAKER_02: – Yeah, I think it's...
SPEAKER_02: But I think left to right is more often associated with volume, and top down is more with channel change.
SPEAKER_02: – But it's almost remote controls.

SPEAKER_04:...or you can choose one if you buy the project.
SPEAKER_01: No, it's not something...
SPEAKER_01:...or it's something...
SPEAKER_01:...so you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger...
SPEAKER_01:...is that a good opportunity?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, so I put it like that.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, you let it slide in the docking station.
SPEAKER_02: Do we have to design that as well?
SPEAKER_02: The docking station?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think so.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we can do that.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that can be very simple.
SPEAKER_04: It could be just a recharger.
SPEAKER_03: Just where?
SPEAKER_03: Just a second.
SPEAKER_03: You're around something.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we had one example.
SPEAKER_02: But do we have to make contacts on the remote control and the recharging as well?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but that's a round one.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe we can choose then.
SPEAKER_03: Here you just see one.
SPEAKER_03: That's very round.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So I think that can be all kind of shapes.
SPEAKER_01: But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit.
SPEAKER_02: Off the remote control?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So you don't want this...
SPEAKER_03:...like the iPod and Phil's, but...
SPEAKER_03:...and the other one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think it will just look like...
SPEAKER_03:...more like this one, since this is also rounded.
SPEAKER_03: No, just the corners.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, those are already a bit corners.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but we can do all kinds of...
SPEAKER_02:...as long as it is in 2D, we can use all kind of round shapes.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but then we have to...
SPEAKER_02:...yeah, but if we want to make it kind of...
SPEAKER_03:...yeah, new...
SPEAKER_03: I've had a lot of pictures of old ones and all curves have already been done.
SPEAKER_01: It's a bit annoying, is it?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: What do we do round?
SPEAKER_04: Just more like this and not...
SPEAKER_04:...that's quite...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, well...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but we could do a lot more curving.
SPEAKER_03: Like we do with...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I know we can do a lot more, but...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Like in this kind of shape.
SPEAKER_04: It's very annoying.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if it's handy.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and yeah, I think it will only look more like the old...
SPEAKER_03:...most controls.
SPEAKER_02: This?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The old ones looked like...
SPEAKER_02:...just a square thing.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, okay, but I had a lot of pictures.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, I can show you here.
SPEAKER_03: What do you want to look like?
SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
SPEAKER_03: Curse, curves.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Even more...
SPEAKER_03:...bear as well.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_03: This was a very small one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, if you go very simple.
SPEAKER_01: So we have to make a decision what kind of form it's going to have.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I think if...
SPEAKER_03:...my opinion,...if we just take the iPod and the same look,...or just put it in color,...but the same light colors.
SPEAKER_03: And just together with the back lights,...look, we'll look very new.
SPEAKER_03: No rubber buttons or something.
SPEAKER_03: Just to get it with the back lights,...you'll get a totany new look,...more like the M-Pay 3 player.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You have to scroll button inside.
SPEAKER_01: Why do you have to round it on the bottom then?
SPEAKER_01: Just skip that one as well.
SPEAKER_03: Doesn't have to be.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's cool.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's the trend before we want to make it.
SPEAKER_02: But yeah, I'm not a trend watcher, you are.
SPEAKER_04: The trend is...
SPEAKER_01:...sponji.
SPEAKER_01: Sponji?
SPEAKER_01: And fruity, but yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Spongebob.
SPEAKER_04: It's not a lot of trends I find.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so we have still one minute left.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's okay if you just give it a bit square.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know something about ergonomic kind of fits in hand.
SPEAKER_01: But I think it's still for older people.
SPEAKER_01: You still have older people.
SPEAKER_01: It's only annoying if it's like that form like that.
SPEAKER_01: There is one.
SPEAKER_01: But we're aiming at a young person.
SPEAKER_04: There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy.
SPEAKER_04: And it looks original.
SPEAKER_04: And I hope we can make it look not like the iPod itself.
SPEAKER_04: It must have a very different...
SPEAKER_03: The idea, but if you look at the way remote controls are now.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, they're all...
SPEAKER_01: But it is already fancy because it's a light on the bottom of the...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, okay, so that's already a very big change.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe make the...
SPEAKER_01: What's it called?
SPEAKER_01: Scroll wheel, make it in yellow or something.
SPEAKER_01: Just like the colors of real reaction.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Now we could do that.
SPEAKER_04: Could.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but if you change the front, the scroll wheel will still be yellow.
SPEAKER_03: I think...
SPEAKER_03: That's right.
SPEAKER_03: The scroll wheel won't be very big.
SPEAKER_03: Since if you put it somewhere in the chances that it will scroll out too big.
SPEAKER_03: So it will just be a small... small scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_03: So it won't stick out much.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe the ones who are going to draw there, maybe have to ask to the...
SPEAKER_01: To her if it...
SPEAKER_01: It can work better than this because it doesn't work properly.
SPEAKER_03: No, maybe you can just open images there and I will paint in paint.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it will be very good.
SPEAKER_04: If you set it up and he will draw here.
SPEAKER_04: Doesn't work.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so we just finish it.
SPEAKER_01: So we make it a bit like...
SPEAKER_01: Is that one probably?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, is that okay?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'm very more like...
SPEAKER_01: Okay, only the color and the flashy light.
SPEAKER_01: Just we skipped the... the... the... the... the speed recognition.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, do we skip that?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think.
SPEAKER_01: Or keep that?
SPEAKER_01: Let's see.
SPEAKER_01: Definitely need that.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, that one is false too.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I don't know, yeah, I think so.
SPEAKER_02: And we have to build in a microphone and...
SPEAKER_02: Well, that's very easy.
SPEAKER_03: We already have the beeping after...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I don't know anything about that.
SPEAKER_02: I didn't receive any information on speed to...
SPEAKER_04: I didn't receive the...
SPEAKER_04: Oh, that's hard.
SPEAKER_03: The information about that.
SPEAKER_04: The main points I just said...
SPEAKER_04: We have to be original in technological innovative.
SPEAKER_04: Because, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So, just put the speed recognition in it as well, okay?
SPEAKER_03: We'll pop it open then.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, we can put all the...
SPEAKER_01: A function of that in there, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And we need... probably we need a... a false chip then.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we probably need anything.
SPEAKER_02: We probably need anything about it, doesn't it?
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: No, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Because we don't have any information about the cost.
SPEAKER_04: No.
SPEAKER_04: We started with the information about the cost.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I have some... I have some... some information about the cost, but...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Just about the chip.
SPEAKER_04: And how much is the chip... the... the...
SPEAKER_02: I don't know how much, but...
SPEAKER_02: You are the vision as...
SPEAKER_02: Just something new expensive...
SPEAKER_03: Just something new expensive...
SPEAKER_03: The future.
SPEAKER_03: The integrated program...
SPEAKER_03: Simple, sensor, simple speaker unit.
SPEAKER_03: This is a very small electronic unit.
SPEAKER_03: We'll give a standard answer after it...
SPEAKER_03:... recognize the question.
SPEAKER_04: And how does it work?
SPEAKER_03: It doesn't say...
SPEAKER_03: You say record, followed by your question sample, and after a few seconds...
SPEAKER_03:... the answer is simple.
SPEAKER_03: Because...
SPEAKER_03: So, it works like a good morning...
SPEAKER_03:... remote control, and then remote control says...
SPEAKER_03:... good morning.
SPEAKER_01: But does that say anything?
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: It says something like...
SPEAKER_01: Okay, we have to stop it now.
SPEAKER_03: Well, that's integrated in the chip.
SPEAKER_03: So, if you use the speech recognition...
SPEAKER_03: Okay, that's... that's...
SPEAKER_03: It's a separate chip.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know, but if you use speech recognition...
SPEAKER_03:... that will be in it as well.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I don't know anything about this...
SPEAKER_01: We just decide not to put it in, because it's too difficult.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: It would be a good feature.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's too.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, we just put it in, because it's a good feature.
SPEAKER_03: No, no worries about the cost, etc.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, just a chip.
SPEAKER_04: We have to stop it now.
