SPEAKER_04:...
SPEAKER_04: M maybe we could make a clap system.
SPEAKER_04: So when you clap your hands it will beep, or something.
SPEAKER_04: You must find it quickly.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe just a button on the home station.
SPEAKER_01: So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: And we can combine that.
SPEAKER_04: It takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control.
SPEAKER_04: I think we must take a look at this.
SPEAKER_04: It's only 34% because if we make a world new product our own style, this is so difficult.
SPEAKER_04: Next, remote control is also bad for AirZ.
SPEAKER_04: But only if they accept a lot and they watch over 5 hours TV or something.
SPEAKER_04: â€¦aah, we haven't, we mustn't look too much at the last point.
SPEAKER_04: OK, last page.
SPEAKER_04: The last experiment was about gadgets, like speech recognition.
SPEAKER_04: We didn't think about that already.
SPEAKER_04: And an LCD on the remote control.
SPEAKER_04: We already talked about that.
SPEAKER_04: And they finally had a conclusion that younger people, under an age of 45, are more interested in new features.
SPEAKER_04: But they are more critical.
SPEAKER_04: And older people want to spend more money.
SPEAKER_04: But they don't want to have a lot of new features, because they are in their old thinking way.
SPEAKER_04: And they want to keep the old things, the old things.
SPEAKER_03: So we have a new age for 4-bit.
SPEAKER_04: But you already said that the company was about 40 plus clients.
SPEAKER_03: So we just can skip the LCD on the remote control.
SPEAKER_04: I think we can skip speech recognition directly, because it's not reachable for 25 euros.
SPEAKER_04: And then I have my personal preference.
SPEAKER_04: OK, that's not very good, because I thought about the television DVD plays the area, and Fiji are the question about.
SPEAKER_04: But it's already out of the question.
SPEAKER_04: My point is, well, if we make remote control for only television, I think it's hard to sell it for 25 euros, but it's the exercise.
SPEAKER_03: It's too expensive.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, only for television.
SPEAKER_04: On the market you can now buy for 20 euros a remote control for everything.
SPEAKER_04: And we only make it for television, so we must make it very special.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, good usability, so you can use it.
SPEAKER_04: OK, I talked about the home station.
SPEAKER_04: It must be simple, because the elderly people need to use it.
SPEAKER_04: And I found the motto, and we put the fashion in electronics.
SPEAKER_04: And that's the motto we are referenced for our style.
SPEAKER_04: We have to make a new product.
SPEAKER_04: We have to be...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Wonderful kind.
SPEAKER_03: So it has to look...
SPEAKER_04: The company is about their own fashion, their own style.
SPEAKER_03: But old people are not looking for that.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, I think...
SPEAKER_01: Not really.
SPEAKER_02: I think the main thing is usability.
SPEAKER_02: That's when we can make a special product.
SPEAKER_01: Keep it simple, we also have to stand out, because there are already, like you said, so many controls out that support a lot of stuff.
SPEAKER_01: But we have to make sure that we're better in usability and stand out by just looks at it.
SPEAKER_01: So make it just a different color or different shape.
SPEAKER_01: OK.
SPEAKER_04: OK, this was my presentation.
SPEAKER_04: OK.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: So Paul, you can do the right one first.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's on the net.
SPEAKER_03: There is.
SPEAKER_01: OK.
SPEAKER_01: Technical functions design.
SPEAKER_01: OK, well, we have a broad audience.
SPEAKER_01: That isn't true anymore, but we have elderly people, so we need to keep it simple.
SPEAKER_01: The way I want to keep it simple is to use the standards.
SPEAKER_01: So the standardized methods, like on all remote controls.
SPEAKER_01: Not to fool, like Jens already said, only 10% is being used.
SPEAKER_03: So what do you think of only the numbers and the off button?
SPEAKER_01: We have to do the next page, but yes, basic functions, like numbers and that sort of stuff.
SPEAKER_01: So the option is that we put on there should be eased used, because you have more room than, and for elderly people, big buttons, an icon on it or a text on it, so it's very clear what that button does.
SPEAKER_01: So it doesn't take much time to figure out how to use it.
SPEAKER_01: A way to find out what people use.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe just use questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people, elderly people.
SPEAKER_01: What they use, what they want on remote control to find out.
SPEAKER_01: But there was already one done.
SPEAKER_01: Well, functions I could think of volume channels.
SPEAKER_01: The basic I call it numpad.
SPEAKER_01: So I call it a text service option.
SPEAKER_01: Basic on off.
SPEAKER_01: And I found it, could I think of favorites?
SPEAKER_01: I always look up the same pages on text and I always have to click the number.
SPEAKER_01: What if you could make a new option that you just have to press one button and you get on your...
SPEAKER_02: So remember what favorite is what channel, so you might as well remember the number.
SPEAKER_03: No, maybe it's too complicated, I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_01: Well, it's a good idea.
SPEAKER_01: It was just a thought, so I would find it handy, I think, when you just press one button and you get on 666.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay, but how can you remember what channel connects to what favorite button?
SPEAKER_01: I was reading on the page, I'm writing a full just since command, basic commands to the television.
SPEAKER_01: So switch to channel 6.
SPEAKER_01: So a button 6 says 6.
SPEAKER_01: And if you make favorites, it can say 666 in a row.
SPEAKER_01: Just numbers.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay, but for a user to remember, if I press that button, it goes to that channel.
SPEAKER_02: Well, if you set a favorite.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but isn't it hard to remember?
SPEAKER_02: Like favorite one.
SPEAKER_03: For me, if I use my telephone, I never use those buttons to question.
SPEAKER_03: No, neither do I.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, now maybe not.
SPEAKER_03: If I don't do it, maybe old people.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe old people.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, they don't like new features, so maybe not.
SPEAKER_01: Well, play pause.
SPEAKER_01: And I know that it's useful.
SPEAKER_01: It's not anymore for TV.
SPEAKER_01: Right, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Did I miss any other buttons, basic buttons?
SPEAKER_01: I couldn't think of any other, especially not for TV.
SPEAKER_03: Just on the front as well.
SPEAKER_03: No, that's only the only thing you need.
SPEAKER_02: The next and previous, previous I know, but next channel.
SPEAKER_01: Just a channel, what I mean is that.
SPEAKER_02: Like a web browser.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: But there's also a button to go to the channel you've been before.
SPEAKER_02: Like a web browser.
SPEAKER_01: Back button.
SPEAKER_01: I don't have.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I know what it is, but I think it's all the difficulties.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: You used that when you want to go to.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, just use when you want to switch between channels all the time.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we want to do it like if you have a channel above 10.
SPEAKER_03: Normally you can press one.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think, especially for older people, you use standard buttons.
SPEAKER_01: So you have that.
SPEAKER_01: The 10 plus button.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the 10 plus button.
SPEAKER_01: Just one one pressing or quickly after each other.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Just to keep it simple and standard features.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, wouldn't it be a problem to, because you have to be fast enough.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe the elderly people.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But I think that's in the TV as well.
SPEAKER_01: That's how the TV handle the bit.
SPEAKER_01: You can have a button that says.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's not.
SPEAKER_00: It's not that.
SPEAKER_01: So you have like a.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but that's the second's very add to press those two buttons.
SPEAKER_04: It's what Paul says.
SPEAKER_04: It's not remote control.
SPEAKER_04: That.
SPEAKER_04: That makes the TV.
SPEAKER_04: Do one to it's the TV.
SPEAKER_04: Who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one seconds that you must type one.
SPEAKER_01: So if you have a universal TV controller, you need that one button that has two stripes.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So you have a period of, I don't know, five seconds to press those buttons in that.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: No for elderly people to look.
SPEAKER_01: One, two, press and aim and.
SPEAKER_03: But do we still need the two level remote control because if you only have that.
SPEAKER_01: It's only for television now.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: I just thought of another one.
SPEAKER_01: Most things in modern TV are also under menu.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Do we also need a menu button.
SPEAKER_01: And then a navigation.
SPEAKER_01: But we can integrate that with volume and previous the next.
None: So you have.
SPEAKER_02: I think you really have to divide between functions you often use.
SPEAKER_02: Like maybe switch channels and volume and good at kind of things.
SPEAKER_02: And the menu button because you almost never use menu button.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: But maybe it's still still a good idea.
SPEAKER_03: I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_03: You would have to use a mute button to.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: A mute button.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe I don't know where you have to put it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Well, that's, I think that's the latest type.
SPEAKER_01: You just now have to figure out what's, what's it put on.
SPEAKER_01: What we can use.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And later we can do the design.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Now my personal preference is using the standards.
SPEAKER_01: Basic.
SPEAKER_01: I think that we should stand out unique.
SPEAKER_01: Being unique with the design.
SPEAKER_01: So we have to, I don't know, make a different shape than usual.
SPEAKER_01: So when you are in the shop and you see our TV control hanging that it stands out.
SPEAKER_01: Not just in a row.
SPEAKER_01: And you see all the same.
SPEAKER_03: You know, same remote controls.
SPEAKER_03: It has to be, it has to be a different color.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know, different colors.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe we can give it out in different colors.
SPEAKER_04: You can choose.
SPEAKER_04: You like an dynamic or something.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: No, why not?
SPEAKER_04: Or that's fancy.
SPEAKER_04: That's a.
SPEAKER_03: It looks cheap as well because it's a small thing.
SPEAKER_03: It's only 24 of yours.
SPEAKER_03: It looks very cheap if you make it.
SPEAKER_01: Well, maybe we can look at mobile phones.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, you just, I don't know what happened.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, we have to look at mobile phones.
None: That's right.
SPEAKER_03: The design very well.
SPEAKER_01: And, well, basically, are the same, just a bit smaller.
SPEAKER_01: You think you can't make it if you control too small.
SPEAKER_01: Because then you will always lose it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But, well, I think that's a good example.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, you have to hurry up a bit because I don't know what to make.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: You finished again.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Well, the working design.
SPEAKER_02: The method I use is search the web.
SPEAKER_02: Just a web page provided.
SPEAKER_02: Basically, I'm not very technical educated, but I could figure it out.
SPEAKER_02: Basically, what happens is you press a button.
SPEAKER_02: Then the circuit gets closed by pressing the button, like a switch.
SPEAKER_02: And by closing that certain circuit, Chip knows what button is pressed.
SPEAKER_02: So, like, you press a one, that circuit is closed.
SPEAKER_02: And then the Chip produces a pattern, like a Morse code, and sends that to the LED.
SPEAKER_02: That's the light emitting diet, I think.
SPEAKER_02: And the light emitting diet is producing infrared light.
SPEAKER_02: That's invisible to the human eye, and transmit that to the TV.
SPEAKER_02: However, there's also a visible diet.
SPEAKER_02: That's blinking red, if you look in it.
SPEAKER_02: And that's another diet, I believe, because infrared is not visible.
SPEAKER_02: So, that's two different things.
SPEAKER_03: So, we also have to have a LED.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think so.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure if it's the same thing.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's just to indicate that it's active.
SPEAKER_03: Or just the green one, because if you use it, it's green, or the red.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, maybe I think it's in the case that it's active.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, when you press it.
SPEAKER_04: So, the red is just...
SPEAKER_03: The red shows up like something's wrong, and green is like, it's okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: Almost remote controls is red.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, we make it one.
SPEAKER_01: So, maybe we don't have to make red.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe integrate it into the design as well.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, if the whole remote control becomes green, if you press the button.
SPEAKER_03: That's cool.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe.
SPEAKER_02: I think the batteries will be...
SPEAKER_02: Now we have a little recharge.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_01: If you can still make that.
SPEAKER_01: It doesn't have to be red, it's just to indicate something.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that is working.
SPEAKER_02: Not the batteries are low.
SPEAKER_02: It's not very important.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, just to indicate it's working.
SPEAKER_02: And the receptor in the TV senses the pattern.
SPEAKER_02: So, we have to understand what patterns are used to make it universal.
SPEAKER_02: So, that can be used with all the TVs.
SPEAKER_02: And we have to really understand what patterns are used.
SPEAKER_02: So, we can...
SPEAKER_02: Otherwise, it won't work.
SPEAKER_01: So, we have to make buttons for that as well.
SPEAKER_02: No, the chip is producing the pattern.
SPEAKER_02: So, we have to make a chip that produces patterns to...
SPEAKER_04: An automatic search function for each television.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, or I don't know exactly how it works.
SPEAKER_02: It wasn't explained there.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I use a universal remote control.
SPEAKER_01: And before we end, you have a list of all the TVs you have, etc.
SPEAKER_01: And you have to put in a number.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So, it works on your TV.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, I have a modern one.
SPEAKER_04: And the modern one.
SPEAKER_04: You type a search.
SPEAKER_04: And the lead became to Blink.
SPEAKER_04: Blink, Blink.
SPEAKER_04: And after a short time, the television turns off.
SPEAKER_04: And then you know, oh, it's the right one.
SPEAKER_04: And you can stop it.
SPEAKER_04: And then it's OK.
SPEAKER_04: So, you don't have to search for your television or your code.
SPEAKER_04: It's the search pattern for itself.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So, we have to make a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one.
SPEAKER_02: Because you have to...
SPEAKER_03: Can you just say it again?
SPEAKER_03: Because I was just looking at this.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, sure.
SPEAKER_02: Well, you have this chip.
SPEAKER_02: And it's because when the circuit is closed, it produces the pattern.
SPEAKER_02: But basically for brands of TV, these patterns are different.
SPEAKER_02: So, like when you press a one on one TV, it goes to one.
SPEAKER_02: And on another TV, it won't work, basically.
SPEAKER_02: So, basically, what you have to do is get these patterns right.
SPEAKER_02: And that can be done by just changing the signal.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, changing the signal.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, changing the pattern all the time.
SPEAKER_02: And what he's doing when he's configuring this pattern, this chip, is trying to switch off the television.
SPEAKER_02: And when it's switched off, you can push your button.
SPEAKER_02: It's working now.
SPEAKER_02: And then he saves that setting.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And then he's working.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, that's the right option.
SPEAKER_02: Well, the components.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, this is a bit technical.
SPEAKER_02: And I hadn't, I was a little short on time.
SPEAKER_02: But I think I understand it.
SPEAKER_02: The energy source is the battery, basically.
SPEAKER_02: That's connecting to all the components.
SPEAKER_02: Because it has to be fed with energy.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, the subcomponent is, I think it is the button pressed.
SPEAKER_02: So, basically, when you press a button, a switch gets closed.
SPEAKER_02: And that's connecting to a chip.
SPEAKER_02: So, the chip knows what button you pressed.
SPEAKER_02: And the chip sends out the pattern to the infrared bulb.
SPEAKER_02: I didn't put the description by this one.
SPEAKER_02: So, the normal flashing lights.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So, that's the LED.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And this is the LED too.
SPEAKER_02: But this one is producing infrared light.
SPEAKER_02: It's invisible.
SPEAKER_02: And this one is producing normal light.
SPEAKER_03: So, we can make the normal one also a normal light.
SPEAKER_03: Another LED light is a normal one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Flash up your...
SPEAKER_04: If you use the buttons, both of them works.
SPEAKER_04: But one you can't see.
SPEAKER_04: And one indicates that you use a button.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah. Because when you press a button and it doesn't work, it can basically, if the battery is low, it won't work.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So, you have to indicate that it's...
SPEAKER_03: Maybe you have to put a small light around the button you push.
SPEAKER_03: So, you see green if you push that button.
SPEAKER_04: I think it's a necessary power.
SPEAKER_04: You use that.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe if you do that, you know that you're sending a signal.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And it's...
SPEAKER_03: You also know which button.
SPEAKER_04: And the whole remote control, I have to be...
SPEAKER_04: Let's.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's right.
SPEAKER_03: Everywhere and there.
SPEAKER_03: Does it make any difference for the energy you use?
SPEAKER_03: You still want that.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it will look different.
SPEAKER_01: And I think we need to find something else.
SPEAKER_01: It looks different, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Because otherwise we will just make another standard.
SPEAKER_01: And our motto also is...
SPEAKER_04: Just let's beneath the buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Around the buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Or in the buttons, even.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but like when you push it...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, then the one that is here.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you have your finger over the button.
SPEAKER_02: So you can see...
SPEAKER_02: You must be around in there.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Or maybe on top of the green light splashing on.
SPEAKER_04: Not here.
SPEAKER_04: But here.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, there.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe here.
SPEAKER_03: The same as a telephone or a mobile phone or...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we're thinking about that.
SPEAKER_01: If you're a mobile phone in the dark...
SPEAKER_01: Light-set, everything lights up.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it only takes a little energy.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's a mobile phone.
SPEAKER_01: And the phone can do it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, maybe that's a good idea for all people as well.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, if you were in the dark, you can't see the numbers.
SPEAKER_03: It's only a few letters or any four or something.
SPEAKER_03: Four letters.
SPEAKER_01: No, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: But if we use a battery station, which I think we'll use.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's a good idea.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we'll have enough power to...
SPEAKER_03: Everything everyone agrees with that or...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe we'll pause it on the home station.
SPEAKER_04: I bet you'll call your remote control.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: But you have to make it sound devised in it.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, there must be sound in it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, maybe it's that little too hard to make...
SPEAKER_02: Especially for that kind of money.
SPEAKER_02: It has to be...
SPEAKER_02: The production cost is 12.5.
SPEAKER_04: 12.5, okay.
SPEAKER_04: But we only have to make it for television.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_01: We must have something special.
SPEAKER_01: We also have...
SPEAKER_01: Remote controls with a lot of options.
SPEAKER_01: But we lose about 90% of those options.
SPEAKER_01: So I think you can...
SPEAKER_04: You have to give customers some extra.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think we will save money with that.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, you're almost finished.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the personal preference I didn't fill it out.
SPEAKER_02: Because it was sure on time.
SPEAKER_02: But basically what we could do too is have a Bluetooth integration.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I just wanted to talk to some about some more.
SPEAKER_03: So maybe you...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_03: Oh, sorry.
SPEAKER_03: What's that?
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_03: Oh, sorry.
SPEAKER_03: We have some new project requirements.
SPEAKER_03: We have to have a look what they are.
SPEAKER_03: Still...
SPEAKER_03: Teletext has become outdated since the popularity of Internet.
SPEAKER_03: So a Teletext option.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe we have to skip that one.
SPEAKER_03: I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_02: I think a lot of people use Teletext.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's on your televisions, only one button.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We definitely should use it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I told you the remote control should only be used for a televisions.
SPEAKER_03: So that's maybe easier.
SPEAKER_03: And the 40 plus people already told you.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, no, sorry.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, this is a problem.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, sorry about that.
SPEAKER_03: The new product should reach a new market with customers or the young enough 40.
SPEAKER_03: So it should be flashy or just...
SPEAKER_03: Oh, interesting.
SPEAKER_03: Sorry about that, I just didn't read it.
SPEAKER_03: So did you make some...
SPEAKER_03: Chash...
SPEAKER_03: Chash about that?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that kind of changed the whole situation.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, then we have to make some nice features.
SPEAKER_01: I think the thing in the dark is a good way to make more...
SPEAKER_01: More like mobile phone.
SPEAKER_01: More modern.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's important, I think.
SPEAKER_04: LCD doesn't work for 12.5 euros, I think.
SPEAKER_01: Don't think it's very usable in remote control, especially when you only have TV functions on it.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think you'll use it often because you can see on the television what channel you...
SPEAKER_04: Watching that channel one.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think that's not usable now.
SPEAKER_01: So, but...
SPEAKER_01: What other features can we put in?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think you have to make it a bit flashy and popular.
SPEAKER_02: And then the usability is not that required because like in the mobile phones, usability is not that good, I think.
SPEAKER_04: Some of you had something to read about speech recognition, about you said one and the television turns on one.
SPEAKER_04: Is that reachable, maybe?
SPEAKER_04: That's fair.
SPEAKER_04: That's easy, that's cool.
SPEAKER_04: It's 12, for each one.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Only the numbers, only numbers, furthermore nothing, but only the numbers, one to 20 or something.
SPEAKER_04: That should be cool.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, maybe we have to integrate that as well.
SPEAKER_03: If it's possible.
SPEAKER_03: If it's possible, I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know. I don't think it's very expensive actually.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: You only have for microphone.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It has to work.
SPEAKER_02: And does it have to work only in English or in Dutch too?
SPEAKER_04: No, maybe.
SPEAKER_04: Ah, that's a problem.
SPEAKER_02: And...
SPEAKER_02: I only know English.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know how to speak in Dutch or...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's probably my job to figure that out.
SPEAKER_01: I can use cream from wherever.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: One.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know. We have to think about that, but do we do it?
SPEAKER_01: No, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: If we do it.
SPEAKER_01: Is it very usable?
SPEAKER_01: That's what I'm looking at.
SPEAKER_02: And do you have to speak in like anything or...
SPEAKER_03: Maybe it's too hard to realize that.
SPEAKER_03: We have short time to put it on the market.
SPEAKER_03: So that you have to do a lot of testing before we can do that.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, thanks.
SPEAKER_02: You can make it...
SPEAKER_03: You can make the remote control very flexible.
SPEAKER_04: Indeed, the languages are a difficult thing.
SPEAKER_04: Because we...
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if it's useful enough to take the effort to design something with speech recognition.
SPEAKER_02: And also, if you have a good speech recognition, you can just throw the...
SPEAKER_04: Someone says...
SPEAKER_04: The remote control.
SPEAKER_04: Give me one code.
SPEAKER_04: And the TV turns on to one.
SPEAKER_01: It's not to go out of the electromagnetic.
SPEAKER_01: But then you have to say a TV channel one.
SPEAKER_00: Not just one.
SPEAKER_04: But TV one.
SPEAKER_04: That becomes...
SPEAKER_04: Because that's very hard for speech recognition.
SPEAKER_01: Well, you know, but I don't think it's just an useful enough.
SPEAKER_03: So we have to make some decisions.
SPEAKER_03: So you can see on the...
SPEAKER_03: Okay, no speech recognition.
SPEAKER_03: So we have to know what we're going to put on.
SPEAKER_03: Do we make a light under the...
SPEAKER_03: Under the numbers and everything?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think.
SPEAKER_03: If you press something, it lights up for a few seconds.
SPEAKER_03: You can see what other buttons there are.
SPEAKER_03: Okay?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's good.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, we just take that one.
SPEAKER_01: And what else we do?
SPEAKER_01: Also the one in the dark.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: Light's up when it's dark.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but I thought that would be the same if you push something.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it doesn't work all the time.
SPEAKER_04: It doesn't work only when you use it.
SPEAKER_03: Are you going to switch it on or something?
SPEAKER_03: No, if you use one button, it must turn on for 20 seconds.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's right.
SPEAKER_00: It's the same as a telephone.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, all right.
SPEAKER_03: And do we use a...
SPEAKER_03: What's it called?
SPEAKER_03: Like an iMac, and if you can look through it, or just normal.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe it's an option.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe it's an option.
SPEAKER_01: Like we discussed like iPod, different colors, maybe use even different fonts.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Like a phone.
SPEAKER_03: Different colors, okay?
SPEAKER_01: So you just make it...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's cool.
SPEAKER_01: As an option, maybe.
SPEAKER_03: And so the buttons we have...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, this is normal.
SPEAKER_03: We put in the simple buttons on the top, and probably the more complicated buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but there's a lot of different buttons.
SPEAKER_01: We don't really have any...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, maybe you have...
SPEAKER_03: You have to...
SPEAKER_03: When you use teletext, you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one, or to go to the previous one.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I think the buttons are very easy, with just standard buttons.
SPEAKER_03: But maybe you can put the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control,
SPEAKER_01: because you almost never use it. Teletext options are only for buttons or something.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but younger people, I think, more often use the internet, and elderly people often use teletext.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's right.
SPEAKER_04: I use teletexts every day, I think.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, for me too.
SPEAKER_03: So we just give it one level, then.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, one level.
SPEAKER_01: And I think, because we don't have that many buttons, I think the design is most important.
SPEAKER_01: You can integrate the buttons in the design very much, because the door is simple buttons.
SPEAKER_01: If you put one above it, it's clear.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So that's it for...
SPEAKER_03: We're going to have a lunch break.
SPEAKER_03: How long is lunch break?
SPEAKER_03: So yeah, you know what you have to do with this.
SPEAKER_03: This is it.
SPEAKER_03: You get your meal and everything.
SPEAKER_04: Trans-watching, okay?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
None: That's fun.
SPEAKER_04: Yo.
SPEAKER_03: So we finished work for this time.
SPEAKER_03: We can just move in.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Bye.
SPEAKER_04: Well, we need to go to the bathroom.
SPEAKER_04: I think the office is over there.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We can eat something.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we can eat lunch.
None: Yeah.
None: Have you seen this?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I've seen it a lot of times.
SPEAKER_03: I think you can see the frame.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe you have a leg in the middle.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Do you have a leg?
None: Yeah, we're going to the bathroom.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
