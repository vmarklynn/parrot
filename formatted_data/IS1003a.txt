SPEAKER_03: It's not that long.
SPEAKER_03: So I present myself. I'm Adalungman.
SPEAKER_03: And has you may know it.
SPEAKER_03: I'm the project manager.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_03: We will have to...
SPEAKER_03: Speak about the project.
SPEAKER_03: Our project is to create a new remote control.
SPEAKER_03: And as you may know, there's a lot of industrials, interesting in creating and remote control.
SPEAKER_03: So the remote control has to be original, trendy, and user friendly.
SPEAKER_03: Record.
SPEAKER_03: So the project method is the following.
SPEAKER_03: So for the functional design, you have to do individual work.
SPEAKER_03: And also work with meetings, talking with each other.
SPEAKER_03: It will be the same for the conceptual design, and also the same for the detailed design.
SPEAKER_03: The tool training is to try out the whiteboard.
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_03: Maybe you can draw your favorite animal.
SPEAKER_03: And make a list of its favorite characteristics.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know if we have to do that.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe we'll do it later.
SPEAKER_03: So the selling price of the project will be 25 euros.
SPEAKER_03: 25 euros.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's quite good price.
SPEAKER_03: It's a wonderful thing.
None: And...
SPEAKER_03: It will be an international remote control, as we want to sell it in the entire world.
SPEAKER_03: And the product costs will be more than 12 euros and 50 centims.
SPEAKER_03: So, as you will discuss about the remote control, you will have to experience your weather remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Just maybe be imaginative with the remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Try to create something new, and people would like to buy.
SPEAKER_03: And the next meeting will start in 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_03: So you all have your specific role.
SPEAKER_03: And I suppose you know what you have to do.
SPEAKER_03: And you will have to work on the design.
SPEAKER_03: And also to work on the design of technical functions of the remote control.
SPEAKER_03: And think of the user requirements specifications.
SPEAKER_00: Those things just refer to each of us.
SPEAKER_00: I think.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: ME and...
SPEAKER_03: ID.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: ID is for the industrial designer.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And you ID it for the user interface designer.
SPEAKER_00: It's me.

SPEAKER_00: I hope you know what it is.
SPEAKER_02: You know very soon.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think so.
SPEAKER_03: I suppose you have to design it.
SPEAKER_03: And you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So I make a user interface.
SPEAKER_01: You...
SPEAKER_01: And maybe you will just form it.
SPEAKER_02: I think the user interface design is...
SPEAKER_02: You will design how the user will...
SPEAKER_02: Use the relation between the user and...
SPEAKER_01: Make...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And the industrial designer, it is how the object will look like.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe I think...
SPEAKER_01: So the material...
SPEAKER_01: You must be designed...
SPEAKER_01: It's a function design.
SPEAKER_01: I designed the user interface.
SPEAKER_01: You designed the function.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe.
SPEAKER_03: Just the outside and the inside.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.

SPEAKER_00: I'm just...
SPEAKER_00: I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and...
SPEAKER_00: What the users would like to have.
SPEAKER_00: And then...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I guess, converge to the user interface designer.
SPEAKER_00: And then...
SPEAKER_00: Industrial designer.
SPEAKER_03: And when designing the remote control, just remember that it has to be a kind of international product.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So you don't have to do something really specific.
SPEAKER_03: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_03: As everybody will have to use it.
SPEAKER_03: It's the same as keyboards.

SPEAKER_03: The product cost won't be maximum.
SPEAKER_03: More than 12.50 euros.
