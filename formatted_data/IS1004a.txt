None: Mersimicalina Мест Ok, let's go.
SPEAKER_01: So we're here today to have our first kick off meeting about this new project.
SPEAKER_01: We're going to talk about in a few minutes.
SPEAKER_01: So I would be Sebastian, the project manager.
SPEAKER_01: You are...
SPEAKER_00: Michael, I'm the user interface designer.
SPEAKER_02: I'm Giger Mardarigia, I'm the marketing expert.
SPEAKER_03: And I'm Haymond, the industrial designer.
SPEAKER_01: Ok, very good.
SPEAKER_01: Thanks for being here.
SPEAKER_01: So let's have a look to the agenda.
SPEAKER_01: So we are going to go through this agenda and mainly first to make...
SPEAKER_01: to be used to the tools available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here.
SPEAKER_01: Then we'll go to the plan of the project and have general discussions about it.
SPEAKER_01: So the goal of this project is to develop a new remote control.
SPEAKER_01: It should be original, trendy, and also user friendly.
SPEAKER_01: As usual, we will follow the project method that we are using in our company.
SPEAKER_01: It is in three steps, as you know.
SPEAKER_01: First, the functional design, the second, the conceptual design, and then the detailed design.
SPEAKER_01: During each step of each design, you will work separately individually on your specific tasks.
SPEAKER_01: And we will meet to discuss and take decisions about what you did and what we will do next.
SPEAKER_01: So first, we have to train ourselves with all the tools available in this nice meeting room and particularly the whiteboard.
SPEAKER_01: So we are going to go through the whiteboard and take some notes or do some drawings.
SPEAKER_01: So we want to start.
SPEAKER_00: I will explain this one.
SPEAKER_00: I want to draw my favourite animal.
SPEAKER_00: Let's see.
SPEAKER_00: I don't really have a favourite animal, but I think I have one in mind.
SPEAKER_00: I will tell you about the spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a whiteboard.
SPEAKER_00: The spider lives in a web.
SPEAKER_00: It has eight legs.
SPEAKER_00: It can move all about the web in two dimensions.
SPEAKER_00: Unless it is a three-dimensional web, which sometimes there are some spiders that live in a big ball of a web.
SPEAKER_00: The other thing is that some spiders can fly.
SPEAKER_00: They have a web-building material, but it acts like a parachute so they can go and find new web somewhere else.
SPEAKER_00: I think they did this in the Charlotte's web, that movie, that was actually a book first, but at the end all the spiders flew away.
SPEAKER_01: That's my animal.
SPEAKER_01: Guillermo, do you want to?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know why, but when I was a child I wanted to be a panther.
SPEAKER_03: Not a pink panther, but it's very difficult to draw a panther.
SPEAKER_01: It's a bit I don't like it.
SPEAKER_02: It's a friendly panther.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe it's happy because it just ate someone.
SPEAKER_02: Actually, honestly, I don't know what's his behavior.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if it's the male who hands or it's the female.
SPEAKER_02: I think I've watched that lion didn't hunt, it's the female lion who hands.
SPEAKER_02: I like it because it's fast and it's black as well, so it can hide itself very easily.
SPEAKER_02: It looks like powerful, strong.
SPEAKER_02: I watched a film about a black panther when I was a child.
SPEAKER_02: I was in that age when everything was choking me a lot.
SPEAKER_03: I don't like pink panther.
SPEAKER_02: I like it.
SPEAKER_01: Is it help?
SPEAKER_03: This lapel is coming out once in a while.
SPEAKER_03: That's not very strong.
SPEAKER_03: It's not the favorite animal, but I think I'll draw elephant.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, thanks.
SPEAKER_03: Elephant goes like this and it's a zoom.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know whether there should be any distance or not, but I think this is the easiest.
SPEAKER_03: Then we have it strong.
SPEAKER_03: Something like this.
SPEAKER_03: I cute.
SPEAKER_03: It's not so strong.
SPEAKER_03: Sometimes they have a hump.
SPEAKER_03: Elephants are friendly and they have a different way of walking.
SPEAKER_03: Wherever they are going to put their first feet, the second feet will always be.
SPEAKER_03: The third feet will be there.
SPEAKER_03: That's very peculiar about them.
SPEAKER_03: They are very useful to human beings.
SPEAKER_03: At least a few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportation or something.
SPEAKER_03: When they had to carry huge loads from one place to another, elephants were very useful.
SPEAKER_03: They are found in the warm countries.
SPEAKER_03: They are the biggest terrestrial animals.
SPEAKER_03: That's what I know about them.
SPEAKER_00: Is this an Indian or an African elephant?
SPEAKER_03: There are two kinds of different Indian and African elephants.
SPEAKER_03: Indian elephants have one bump and the African have two.
SPEAKER_03: There is a difference in the trunk of the animals.
SPEAKER_03: These elephants are Indian.
SPEAKER_03: For some elephants, the trunk is having one.
SPEAKER_01: Do we have some message there?
SPEAKER_01: We have to cut you.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: We will discuss that offline.
SPEAKER_01: We will do another meeting of the elephants.
SPEAKER_01: Another important part of the project is about money and about finance.
SPEAKER_01: We should target a price of 25 euros for this remote control.
SPEAKER_01: We should generate a profit of 50 million euros.
SPEAKER_01: We should target an international market.
SPEAKER_00: One question.
SPEAKER_00: Is this a standalone unit that we are going to be selling?
SPEAKER_00: You already have a TV but you are buying an extra remote control for something.
SPEAKER_01: This is the next topic we have to discuss.
SPEAKER_01: We should decide which kind of remote control we want to go.
SPEAKER_01: We should be specific remote control to some specific device.
SPEAKER_01: Should be a universal one and an extra.
SPEAKER_01: I am waiting for your inputs very quickly because we have only three minutes to go.
SPEAKER_00: It seems that the first thing that they have specified is the price based on how much profit we want to make.
SPEAKER_00: It seems to be a little strange if we do not know what the product is.
SPEAKER_00: If that is the requirement that we need to design the product to actually fit that price bracket.
SPEAKER_00: We need to find out what people are willing to pay for.
SPEAKER_00: What kind of product they are expecting for 25 euros.
SPEAKER_00: It seems quite a lot for remote control.
SPEAKER_01: I think this is more a job to our market person.
SPEAKER_01: It should be the topic of the next meeting.
SPEAKER_01: We have another view of this.
SPEAKER_01: We need to close the meeting.
SPEAKER_01: We will have a new meeting soon.
SPEAKER_01: We have to work on the working design.
SPEAKER_01: We have to work on the technical functions.
SPEAKER_01: We have to work on user requirements.
SPEAKER_01: You will receive some information by mail as usual.
SPEAKER_01: Thanks for coming today.
None: Thank you for watching.
