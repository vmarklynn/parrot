SPEAKER_02:...
SPEAKER_02:...
SPEAKER_03:...
SPEAKER_03:...
SPEAKER_01:...
SPEAKER_02:...
SPEAKER_03:...
SPEAKER_01:...
SPEAKER_01:...
SPEAKER_01:...
SPEAKER_01:...
SPEAKER_01:...
SPEAKER_01:...
SPEAKER_01:...dei vii Jordan.
SPEAKER_01: Ja.
SPEAKER_01:...aina, industrida, designer, baba.
SPEAKER_02: Ja.
SPEAKER_02: Ok.
SPEAKER_01: So we'll have to evaluate your proposed remote control.
SPEAKER_01:...and have an idea of the price that this thing could cost you.
SPEAKER_01:...and in case if we all agree on the fabric of building our these remote control, we'll evaluate the production.
SPEAKER_01: So maybe I will let the our two designers talk about some...
SPEAKER_01: I have a slide.
SPEAKER_01:...there.
SPEAKER_01: You have to, sorry, oops.
SPEAKER_02:...participatory one slide and maybe you can product, product, discuss every slide.
SPEAKER_02:...ok.
SPEAKER_02:...ok.
SPEAKER_02: So this is our product prototype.
SPEAKER_02: This is made by Klyn.
SPEAKER_01: Looks strange.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The basic color is yellow and red.
SPEAKER_02: Yellow is our company color.
SPEAKER_02: I read it is more attractive.
SPEAKER_02: So we use two basic colors, yellow and red.
SPEAKER_02: At the ship there's two basic ships.
SPEAKER_02: The first is a cycle and the second is a triangle space.
SPEAKER_02: We call it mushroom design.
SPEAKER_02: Looks like some mushroom.
SPEAKER_02: So we call it mushroom design.
SPEAKER_02: So this is the introduction of our product.
SPEAKER_01:...channel tickling modified mushroom, I will say.
SPEAKER_01:...ok.
SPEAKER_02:...ok.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the next slide.
SPEAKER_02: So there are several key features of our prototype.
SPEAKER_02: The first is that it is fancy.
SPEAKER_02: I'm sure this would be the unique design in the market.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe I hope so.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, so it's a fancy design and a unique design.
SPEAKER_02: And the second key feature is that the circle channel selection.
SPEAKER_02: In the traditional controller, you use button to select the channel.
SPEAKER_02: But now we have a circle.
SPEAKER_02: So we can take this ball to select channel.
SPEAKER_02: It's quite convenient for a user to use it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but don't touch.
SPEAKER_02: Don't destroy your first time.
SPEAKER_02: The third feature is the stable triangle base.
SPEAKER_02: This triangle base is very stable.
SPEAKER_02: So it's unlikely you cannot find it.
SPEAKER_02: So you can put it in the table.
SPEAKER_02: So you can turn the ball to select channel.
SPEAKER_02: And there's some cube button.
SPEAKER_02: You can see the shape of the button is a mushroom.
SPEAKER_01: Everything is mushroom.
SPEAKER_01: So we can call our remote control that mushroom.
SPEAKER_02: Mushroom is not really mushroom because you have a lemon shape.
SPEAKER_02: That's why if you put it in the table, you can't eat it.
SPEAKER_02: I hope you don't eat it anyway.
SPEAKER_02: You know, trying to create the food aspect.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, because mushroom was not in the trends.
SPEAKER_02: Vegetables.
SPEAKER_03: Vegetables are the kind of mushroom.
SPEAKER_02: It's vegetable.
SPEAKER_02: It's something easy to eat.
SPEAKER_02: We integrated the different colors.
SPEAKER_03: This is not mushroom anyway.
SPEAKER_02: I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable by using these colors.
SPEAKER_02: Inspired color.
SPEAKER_02: And very sophisticated material.
SPEAKER_02: Next slide.
SPEAKER_02: What I can add is that he talked about what is outside.
SPEAKER_02: What is inside is what we talked before about the chip.
SPEAKER_02: It is a low level chip.
SPEAKER_02: We don't need to cut it.
SPEAKER_02: The low level chips inside and the LCD button.
SPEAKER_02: Where is the battery?
SPEAKER_02: It is in the basement.
SPEAKER_01: Where is the solar cell?
SPEAKER_02: This is a kind of new revolutionary receptor that we can put outside.
SPEAKER_01: Do you think it wants to be increased the price?
SPEAKER_02: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01: It might be okay.
SPEAKER_01: Mr. Monet, what is your opinion according to this remote control?
SPEAKER_03: We will try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about it.
SPEAKER_03: We have three key points for this remote control design.
SPEAKER_03: First one was fancy.
SPEAKER_03: You can feel.
SPEAKER_03: We will try to judge this feature with a 1-7 scale.
SPEAKER_03: One being no.
SPEAKER_03: Just let me check.
SPEAKER_02: 4.3.5, it means it is acceptable.
SPEAKER_03: The 1 being true and 7 being false.
SPEAKER_03: Oops.
SPEAKER_03: Do we have a fancy look and feel?
SPEAKER_02: I think you have nice colors.
SPEAKER_02: The shape is unique.
SPEAKER_03: I agree.
SPEAKER_03: Is it fancy?
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: It was defined by fruit and vegetable look.
SPEAKER_02: You have the lemon aspect of this.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out, maybe you do things like that.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know where the lemon is, but this shape is the lemon.
SPEAKER_01: It would be better, more like a lemon.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe improving the texture, having less buttons.
SPEAKER_02: So my mush.
SPEAKER_01: Looks like more fruit.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe a pineapple?
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: You have the finger here with the buttons?
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: It looks like a pineapple.
SPEAKER_01: What is the use for that?
SPEAKER_02: If you want to tame the ball, it is very convenient for you to tame the ball, to change the channel.
SPEAKER_01: Where is the voice recognition?
SPEAKER_02: It is embedded.
SPEAKER_03: That is the second point.
SPEAKER_03: The first one is we have to judge the...
SPEAKER_01: If it is fancy, you can feel.
SPEAKER_02: Let's say it is a pineapple.
SPEAKER_03: Is the color acceptable?
SPEAKER_03: No, the color is fine.
SPEAKER_02: There is too much red.
SPEAKER_01: It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top.
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_03: From 1 to 7.
SPEAKER_01: 7 is the maximum.
SPEAKER_03: 7 is the fourth and 1 is the second.
SPEAKER_02: I will give 2 or 3.
SPEAKER_02: 3, I will say 3.
None: 3?
SPEAKER_01: Is it better?
SPEAKER_03: Then let me...
SPEAKER_03: What other criterion is...
SPEAKER_03: Is it used technologically?
SPEAKER_01: In a very...
SPEAKER_01: There is a microphone inside.
SPEAKER_02: This is microphone re.
SPEAKER_01: It is a microphone.
SPEAKER_01: There is a technology inside that we can't recognize.
SPEAKER_01: You can turn it.
SPEAKER_01: You can't recognize it.
SPEAKER_03: You can't recognize it.
SPEAKER_03: When you say technologically, it is more...
SPEAKER_01: We have tactile buttons.
SPEAKER_02: You have microphone in where you have...
SPEAKER_02: That's good.
SPEAKER_02: This solar receptor...
SPEAKER_03: That is a good point.
SPEAKER_02: I think technologically it is acceptable.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe 2?
SPEAKER_01: Using the same scale.
SPEAKER_02: You agree?
SPEAKER_03: Maybe the most critical one.
SPEAKER_03: Last one I would like to judge is...
SPEAKER_03: Is it easy to use?
SPEAKER_02: The local command yes.
SPEAKER_02: It might be easy.
SPEAKER_03: Is this very easy?
SPEAKER_03: Can you just explain me the...
SPEAKER_02: This is the base.
SPEAKER_02: So you can turn to change the channel.
SPEAKER_03: How intuitive is it to turn things to change channels?
SPEAKER_03: I think maybe if you want to go from...
SPEAKER_01: If you have some play...
SPEAKER_01: You can turn like that to change the channel.
SPEAKER_01: I think it is quite easy to do zapping.
SPEAKER_01: But maybe it will be too fast.
SPEAKER_03: I am not convinced it is the best way to jump from 1 to 20.
SPEAKER_03: How can you go directly to 20?
SPEAKER_02: No, no.
SPEAKER_02: It depends on the angle.
SPEAKER_02: You can turn it.
SPEAKER_02: You need to turn it from 2.
SPEAKER_02: I think it is 3, 4, 10, 5.
SPEAKER_03: Just imagine you have 50 channels.
SPEAKER_02: You can turn it from 3 to 30.
SPEAKER_02: How many do you have?
SPEAKER_01: But you have to go through all the channels.
SPEAKER_02: I think you have a scale.
SPEAKER_02: When you stop the tone...
SPEAKER_02: Then the angle you stop is the angle.
SPEAKER_03: It is the channel.
SPEAKER_03: How do you know this angle is the correct one?
SPEAKER_02: It is very easy because you know how many channels are there.
SPEAKER_03: So you count at a 1 degree to 2 degrees?
SPEAKER_02: No, you can do it.
SPEAKER_03: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_02: I think so.
SPEAKER_02: I think so.
SPEAKER_02: The vocal command is easy to do.
SPEAKER_03: We have said previously that maybe it is not going to be...
SPEAKER_01: When you are zapping, you are changing from 1 channel to the other.
SPEAKER_01: So you are passing through all the channels.
SPEAKER_01: So when you say I want to go to channel number 20, you have decided to go to channel 20.
SPEAKER_01: Because you really want to go on this channel.
SPEAKER_01: This will be more for browsing.
SPEAKER_01: You don't really know what you want to do.
SPEAKER_01: You can turn it.
SPEAKER_01: Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting.
SPEAKER_01: Seems to be good.
SPEAKER_01: Good choice Mr. David Jordan.
SPEAKER_01: You famous with other...
SPEAKER_02: You can't do this.
SPEAKER_02: You can turn it.
SPEAKER_02: If you want to skip from channel 1 to channel 2, you skip this.
SPEAKER_02: If you want to skip from channel 1 to channel 10, you turn this.
SPEAKER_02: It's like fine from cost to fine.
SPEAKER_02: This is fine.
SPEAKER_02: It costs to fine.
SPEAKER_02: This looks better.
SPEAKER_02: This is from one channel to another channel.
SPEAKER_02: You have the vocal comment.
SPEAKER_02: On off.
SPEAKER_03: It has to be on to...
SPEAKER_01: It's also time you add them.
SPEAKER_01: Sleeping remote control.
SPEAKER_03: That's not the ecological.
SPEAKER_01: That's why we have the solar.
SPEAKER_02: To come back to the computer.
SPEAKER_03: Which number?
SPEAKER_02: It's very relative but it's fine.
SPEAKER_02: Do you agree?
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: So the reason about this 4 is 1.
SPEAKER_02: It's 3 for me.
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_02: Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives.
SPEAKER_01: What's your opinion?
SPEAKER_03: We didn't say...
SPEAKER_03: Those are sort of agree but this one would be more 5 to me.
SPEAKER_03: 5?
SPEAKER_03: I mean this is just a prototype.
SPEAKER_03: I'm not really convinced it's so easy to use.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe what you compare with traditional controller.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's easier than traditional controller.
SPEAKER_02: If you use traditional controller, you have to put the button.
SPEAKER_02: Now you don't have to put the button.
SPEAKER_02: You have to just pin the...
SPEAKER_02: You can't control the skill.
SPEAKER_02: How can you control the skill?
SPEAKER_02: By pushing 0 with the 1st one.
SPEAKER_02: And 1.
SPEAKER_02: You can do it.
SPEAKER_02: But you can also do it in the...
SPEAKER_02: If you do not want to browse the channel, you can just...
SPEAKER_02: There's also a button here.
SPEAKER_02: There's some versions.
SPEAKER_02: This function is just for your browsing.
SPEAKER_02: From one channel to the next one.
SPEAKER_02: It's not just a previously previously.
SPEAKER_01: Changing your mind.
SPEAKER_01: Find to course.
SPEAKER_01: From 10 to 10 channel.
SPEAKER_02: 10 to 10 to 10 to 20.
SPEAKER_02: And this one 1 to 3, 4, 5, 6.
SPEAKER_02: Like this.
SPEAKER_02: There's different skill.
SPEAKER_02: So you can choose.
SPEAKER_03: This has to stay on the table.
SPEAKER_03: This has to stay on the table.
SPEAKER_02: In fact, on a flat plate.
SPEAKER_02: This is just a bit.
SPEAKER_03: You can...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, then when you turn it...
SPEAKER_01: No, no.
SPEAKER_01: You can't put it out.
SPEAKER_01: It's just your turning from the base.
SPEAKER_01: You need to have everything in hand.
SPEAKER_03: If you want to turn, you can't use it and turn.
SPEAKER_03: You need to put it on.
SPEAKER_01: That's the weak point.
SPEAKER_01: Because with the traditional one, you just have one hand.
SPEAKER_01: And say, I've lost the remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Nobody would take it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you would never lose it from there.
SPEAKER_02: This is the next generation.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe.
SPEAKER_02: It's the next prototype.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe we can change from...
SPEAKER_01: Maybe for it.
SPEAKER_01: For it.
SPEAKER_01: It's easy to use for.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, for it's more.
SPEAKER_03: It's easier to...
SPEAKER_02: I can't hear it with this.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, for it's more than ever.
SPEAKER_02: So average.
SPEAKER_02: Nine over three?
SPEAKER_02: Three.
SPEAKER_02: Three.
SPEAKER_02: It's average, eight, seven, eight.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so...
SPEAKER_02: It needs maybe some further work.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, especially on the easy to use.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Target.
SPEAKER_01: So the project is accepted?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: If you really want to have a fruitful remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: So final.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, we had a prototype presentation with the evaluation.
SPEAKER_01: So as we all agree to accept...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Under certain conditions, the prototype will have looked to the final...
SPEAKER_01: Financial view.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: We need to calculate their projection cost.
SPEAKER_01: As I said in the first meeting, when to have a remote control, that would cost more than 12 and more than 50 euros.
SPEAKER_01: And if it's not the case, you would have to redesign it.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: Just have a look at the...
SPEAKER_01: Okay, here is the...
SPEAKER_01: Excel...
SPEAKER_01: Shit.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: So as the energy source, we have Han Dinamo.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: We don't use that.
SPEAKER_01: We have battery, right?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I'm literally...
SPEAKER_01: Kinetic.
SPEAKER_01: We don't have it.
SPEAKER_01: I suppose.
SPEAKER_01: But we have solar cells.
SPEAKER_01: How many do you need solar cells?
SPEAKER_01: Do you think one would be enough for them?
SPEAKER_01: Such as...
SPEAKER_02: I think it's number of branches.
SPEAKER_02: Three.
SPEAKER_02: It's very solar cells.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: Electronic.
SPEAKER_01: Single chip and print.
SPEAKER_01: Just one would be necessary.
SPEAKER_02: One?
SPEAKER_01: Zero for the others.
SPEAKER_01: And sample sensors and pull speaker.
SPEAKER_03: One.
SPEAKER_02: As we have voice recognition, I think.
SPEAKER_01: So the case...
SPEAKER_02: It will be...
SPEAKER_03: So we are already 19.
SPEAKER_02: Wooden?
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Just...
SPEAKER_01: Keep on going.
SPEAKER_01: Just have an idea.
SPEAKER_02: It's yes, the wooden...
SPEAKER_02: There's no wood.
SPEAKER_01: Plastic, just on the...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but what about case?
SPEAKER_01: An curved, flat, single curved, double curved.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's more like double curved.
SPEAKER_01: It's not going to be double curved.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, double curved.
SPEAKER_01: One?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Wood?
SPEAKER_02: But this is...
SPEAKER_02: A rubber...
SPEAKER_01: No, no.
SPEAKER_01: Do we need special color?
SPEAKER_01: Maybe two?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we have two special colors.
SPEAKER_01: Push button.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we have four.
SPEAKER_02: Five?
SPEAKER_02: Five?
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
None: Scrawl wheel?
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: It's more like integrated...
SPEAKER_01: I think this will be like a squirrel.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it will.
SPEAKER_02: You turn it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe two squirrel wheel as well.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, true.
SPEAKER_01: Of course, to find a squirrel wheel.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So no button supplements?
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I think we have problem.
SPEAKER_01: L.C. display, maybe?
SPEAKER_02: Into phrase.
SPEAKER_02: I think we...
SPEAKER_01: If we keep on adding things...
SPEAKER_01: It's okay.
SPEAKER_01: That's fine.
SPEAKER_01: So we have to...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, one of the key points is solar cells.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe if...
SPEAKER_01: If suppose if we change, you know, we could put just one.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
None: Has it changed?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it was changed.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, it did change.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it was changed.
SPEAKER_03: It did change.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: We have to select electronics to from...
SPEAKER_02: From the sample sensor to regular tip.
SPEAKER_02: Oh.
SPEAKER_02: We have to delete the sample sensor.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but we have the voice recognition.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but this one, one of the feature we were...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's a one...
SPEAKER_02: Maybe we have two words.
SPEAKER_02: It's the first part in the basic one.
SPEAKER_02: It's the word into plastic, maybe.
SPEAKER_01: It seems that this can be...
SPEAKER_02: It would be better.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, word into plastic.
SPEAKER_02: It should be fine.
SPEAKER_02: Plastic is free.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So do we need special color?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's one of...
SPEAKER_03: Because we have red.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, right.
SPEAKER_01: And yellow.
SPEAKER_03: We could turn everything in either yellow or black.
SPEAKER_03: Black then is a regular color.
SPEAKER_01: I think so we need...
SPEAKER_01: If we try to have a kind of pineapple bee.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So push button then it's the next...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And we have integrated scroll wheel with push button.
SPEAKER_01: No, I think this is one.
SPEAKER_01: Integrated scroll wheel push button.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it is fine.
SPEAKER_01: So we have only one.
SPEAKER_01: And...
SPEAKER_01: Push button.
SPEAKER_01: Close to.
SPEAKER_01: So if we have all integrated in the scroll wheel and push button, it's...
SPEAKER_02: Okay, remove maybe...
SPEAKER_02: You have five push buttons so we can just...
SPEAKER_02: You know, try to modify some of them to have...
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so what's the...
SPEAKER_03: What a leg.
SPEAKER_02: How about between the other two?
SPEAKER_02: Double curb.
SPEAKER_02: We can transform the double curb into...
SPEAKER_01: Something flat.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but flat.
SPEAKER_01: Uncurved.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, maybe not.
SPEAKER_02: Single curb better.
SPEAKER_02: Single curb is fine.
SPEAKER_00: We have only one ure left.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe don't, but no battery only so myself.
SPEAKER_01: I think somebody gets...
SPEAKER_03: I think there's a problem with the push button.
SPEAKER_01: We only need...
SPEAKER_01: Just one.
SPEAKER_00: Push, just one.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: That's fine.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, actually...
SPEAKER_03: So we have one button.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we have one button.
SPEAKER_01: And...
SPEAKER_02: One scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_02: Scroll wheel with push button on it.
SPEAKER_02: And the vocal command, it's fine.
SPEAKER_03: It's good they're not charging anything for them.
SPEAKER_01: So yeah, I think we've done a good job as the cost is...
SPEAKER_02: Could we have...
SPEAKER_02: 12 or 15?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, actually it's wrong.
SPEAKER_03: We are not under 12.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but it's under or equal.
SPEAKER_02: It's not written.
SPEAKER_02: It's under or equal.
SPEAKER_02: It's fine.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so let's see...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's fine, right?
SPEAKER_02: Which part is the most depends in part?
SPEAKER_02: Solar cells.
SPEAKER_02: Solar cells.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think so too.
SPEAKER_01: I think, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But it would be interesting for our marketing team to make...
SPEAKER_01: To be able to sell these things.
SPEAKER_03: Advertisement when turning the solar cells to be cheaper.
SPEAKER_03: That's nice argument, but...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's nice.
SPEAKER_02: It's still...
SPEAKER_02: It's very, very, very expensive.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but it would be technologically innovative, so...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but we just have one button.
SPEAKER_01: So it's easy to use in powerful...
SPEAKER_01: As the remote control has only one button.
SPEAKER_03: Easy, I don't know about powerful.
SPEAKER_02: It's easy, it's very easy to use the phone.
SPEAKER_01: So I don't think we need to redesign the product.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, that's what we've just done.
SPEAKER_03: You've done it, it's under the...
SPEAKER_02: If it was low, higher, so...
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_02: So what are we going to do with this project evaluation?
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_03: We have to discuss it.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So did you enjoy your clay modeling?
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Of course.
SPEAKER_01: This is my job.
SPEAKER_01: Was it a nice way to create your remote control?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's a...
SPEAKER_02: It's good to...
SPEAKER_02: To create a control instead of a computer.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think I found it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process from the beginning to the end and designing, looking at the chips, the solar cells, and...
SPEAKER_02: It was very informative for me.
SPEAKER_01: And for the marketing guy?
SPEAKER_03: Oh, that was good, but we should have more brainstorming like meetings, maybe.
SPEAKER_03: Because we're just presenting one is presenting his stuff.
SPEAKER_03: Next one is his stuff.
SPEAKER_03: And then we try to combine afterwards.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And new ideas about new products, maybe, which would be fashion and...
SPEAKER_01: And yellow?
SPEAKER_02: Yellow.
SPEAKER_02: I think you can think about yellow TV now.
SPEAKER_02: After a food TV or I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: I can be interesting.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, just a lemon.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, a lemon TV.
SPEAKER_02: Yellow lemon.
SPEAKER_02: You know the traditional TV is flat.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's flat.
SPEAKER_02: Squared.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the shape is very boring.
SPEAKER_02: It's really boring.
SPEAKER_02: Come up with new TV.
SPEAKER_02: Such as this kind of TV.
SPEAKER_02: So you can...
SPEAKER_01: You have bass.
SPEAKER_01: The lemon TV with the pineapple remote control.
SPEAKER_02: That's really interesting.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, because the TV...
SPEAKER_01: Oh, that's interesting.
SPEAKER_01: We could do a kind of fruit collection of...
SPEAKER_01: Electronica things.
SPEAKER_03: Electronica device.
SPEAKER_03: We just don't trust too much the...
SPEAKER_03: The fruits.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe.
SPEAKER_03: Because fruits and vegetables you won't last for 10 years.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe it will be insects.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but I think it's good to follow the flow and you know make it now and after you know...
