SPEAKER_02: I'll set.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, cool. Right, so basically I'm just going to go over real quickly some news I just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control and then I'm going to turn it over to you guys to make brief presentations on what you found and then we'll have a bit of discussion.
SPEAKER_02: So basically I've just found out from the board on if you guys got the females well but it needs to be television only.
SPEAKER_02: So we're not doing DVD, we're not doing anything else, it's just going to be a television remote.
SPEAKER_02: It also needs to have the company colors included in it.
SPEAKER_02: So that's red and black and it has to have the slogan.
SPEAKER_02: In case you guys forget the slogan it's we put fashion and electronics and no teletext.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do so we don't want to include that in this particular design for reasons that I don't really know.
SPEAKER_02: But it's the board so there you go.
SPEAKER_02: So basically given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later.
SPEAKER_02: I mean because it's television only we will be able to change our well we can sacrifice more function for a better television remote.
SPEAKER_02: Anyway so I'm going to turn it over to the industrial designer to go ahead and make a presentation.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So do I unplug?
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Are you in this bit here?
None: Yep.
SPEAKER_02: Man I have to hit function of it but it looks like it's going to come up.
None: Okay.
None: Right.
SPEAKER_01: That's page one of my presentation.
SPEAKER_01: So the method we're going to have to understand how remote controls work and it's a successfully complete this project.
SPEAKER_01: Remote control works as follows.
SPEAKER_01: It's all pretty basic stuff for you guys.
SPEAKER_01: Send a message to another system.
SPEAKER_01: So there's an energy source involved in that like battery or solar power, something along those lines.
SPEAKER_01: There's an integrated circuit which is the microchip and that actually composed the messages and usually the way a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system.
SPEAKER_01: User interface controls the chip.
SPEAKER_01: Basically that's the casing and the buttons and accordingly the messages as well.
SPEAKER_01: So my findings, I just did a preliminary study here and I found that too much metal and remote design can potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands and too much metal can cause remote to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals.
SPEAKER_01: Too much metal is used sometimes people pick up radio signals and the like and there's lots of the possibility of remote catching on fire and injuring the customer.
SPEAKER_01: Just think of those lawsuits.
SPEAKER_01: That would be really bad.
SPEAKER_01: Before I suggest primarily plastic construction.
SPEAKER_01: Components just some ideas that I had, energy source.
SPEAKER_01: It's kind of hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup.
SPEAKER_01: User interface, since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic.
SPEAKER_01: The chip, silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that.
SPEAKER_01: But we can't really be different in that respect.
SPEAKER_01: The sender, while I'm thinking infrared cause it is the industry standard multi channel that's the word I made up.
SPEAKER_01: I don't really know what it means.
SPEAKER_01: Pal and NTSC compatible and probably a 200 foot range.
SPEAKER_01: And the receiver of course is a number of electronic devices.
SPEAKER_01: But in this case, the only VTBs.
SPEAKER_01: Personal preferences.
SPEAKER_01: I really think that we should use plastic as a post metal.
SPEAKER_01: The company is simply kind of Ford.
SPEAKER_01: This kind of lawsuits.
SPEAKER_01: Which admittedly is going to come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value.
SPEAKER_01: Because we were thinking.
SPEAKER_02: Is there a way that we can use modern types of polymers or modern types of plastics that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value?
SPEAKER_02: Like if we talk about like on the laptops and other ones that use a pretty nice, you can do is there some kind of nice color, their quality, plastic that we can work with?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem.
SPEAKER_01: For example, the plastic they have in the laptops out there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do.
None: Great.
SPEAKER_01: With my presentation.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you very much, Nathan.
SPEAKER_02: If next week we can have the user interface developer, go ahead and make a brief presentation that would be great as well.
SPEAKER_02: Let's plug yourself in here.
SPEAKER_02: It functionerfate real quickly.
SPEAKER_01: Is it plugged in well?
SPEAKER_01: There it goes.
SPEAKER_01: The computer adjusting.
SPEAKER_02: There you go.
SPEAKER_02: Sweet.
SPEAKER_00: Here we have my technical function design presentation.
SPEAKER_00: So, a few of the requirements we need here.
SPEAKER_00: We basically need to operate an electronic device.
SPEAKER_00: It needs to be universal and possibly operate several different types of devices, although we now find that that's for no problem.
SPEAKER_00: So, some of my findings basically want to send messages to a television set.
SPEAKER_00: That would be any number of different things such as switch on the television switch to a channel, that sort of thing I think we're all quite intelligent and know what a normal remote control does.
SPEAKER_00: Now, some of the other things I found is a complicated remote control.
SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry that we can't go back to the camera.
SPEAKER_00: We might read there very well, but this remote control has many functions.
SPEAKER_00: So, it can do a lot of things, but it is quite complicated and most users will find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't want to take the time to learn how to do it.
SPEAKER_00: As you also notice, it's quite a boring design.
SPEAKER_00: Another remote control, slightly different.
SPEAKER_00: It's a simple remote control.
SPEAKER_00: Many less buttons, but has many fewer functions.
SPEAKER_00: Much easier for the user to manipulate and use.
SPEAKER_00: It also has a bit of a cheap look and is also quite boring.
SPEAKER_00: So my personal process is revolutionized the idea of a remote control.
SPEAKER_00: So attain the functionality of a complicated device, but use a simple format of display for the user to work with.
SPEAKER_00: Now it's going to add another slide here, but I didn't play half time there.
SPEAKER_00: I'm just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously, like having multiple face buttons and whatnot.
SPEAKER_02: Great.
SPEAKER_02: Thanks for that run.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, I love- Yep, that's you.
SPEAKER_03: I think so.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I can plug you in.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, that would be perfect.
None: Thank you.
None: Slide down.
SPEAKER_03: Give it a little bit.
SPEAKER_03: Slide down.
None: Give it a little bit.
None: Slide down.
SPEAKER_03: Give it a little bit.
SPEAKER_02: Slide down.
None: Give it a little bit.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So this is me.
SPEAKER_03: Basically, I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got.
SPEAKER_03: We had a usability test where we were actually, like watching 100 people use TV remote and see what it is that they're using.
SPEAKER_03: And then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general TV remote control practices.
SPEAKER_03: Pretty much through testing, we were finding out that most of the time, everybody's just using changing the channel, turning it on, using the volume, the majority of the time that's all that's going on.
SPEAKER_03: The other functions happen for some people they're important, but the primary uses are really, really basic.
SPEAKER_03: And so big, complicated, remote, like we're one who saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use.
SPEAKER_03: They're not using a lot of it.
SPEAKER_03: They don't need it.
SPEAKER_03: They even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons they don't want to do with.
SPEAKER_03: And we also found out that 50% of our people, the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it and then they can't find it in the room.
SPEAKER_03: So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something, we're really coming to play with a lot of these people.
SPEAKER_03: There's also a survey about what they liked about the remote.
SPEAKER_03: And pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful.
SPEAKER_03: And the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically.
SPEAKER_03: That's up to the design people.
SPEAKER_03: But it is something we're thinking about, especially since the younger demographics are obviously the one that's going to keep growing.
SPEAKER_03: So if that's the direction we're headed in, it's something to think about.
SPEAKER_03: But basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice, which are the standards.
SPEAKER_03: So it's a good start for us.
SPEAKER_02: That's great.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you, Sarah.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: So yeah, I'll just switch that back here.
SPEAKER_02: I'll finish up, which is a bit of discussion.
SPEAKER_02: I will.
SPEAKER_02: I'll plan on for the next phase.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: So I think we've covered most of these important questions through you guys' presentations.
SPEAKER_02: We've got the industrial designers who just, or pretty much, infatically suggested that we need to go with plastic.
SPEAKER_02: Sarah, she's recommended that we go for simpler functions.
SPEAKER_02: So fewer functions.
SPEAKER_02: But we need to decide who we're selling this to.
SPEAKER_02: Your stat suggested that 75% of people under 35 want to thought about voice control.
SPEAKER_02: So do we want to go for that, or do we want to go for an older demographic?
SPEAKER_02: And my thought is we've got, if we're going to go for a sleek look, I mean, we are putting the fashion and electronics.
SPEAKER_03: We're not catering to the pensioners of the world that we'll take.
SPEAKER_02: So maybe this, we should look into this.
SPEAKER_02: Younger demographic.
SPEAKER_02: So we need to wonder how we can make it better and smaller and faster.
SPEAKER_02: We're constrained to plastic very well.
SPEAKER_02: We've got this idea.
SPEAKER_02: We're almost saying we need to think about revolutionizing the way it's looking, which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for tele.
SPEAKER_02: So this voice operation thing is, I think, is a good idea, assuming that it's doable.
SPEAKER_02: At least for the basic controls, maybe we can balance it that way.
SPEAKER_02: You know, we can see, okay, you can't say record alias tonight at 7.
SPEAKER_02: We might be able to say volume up.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But I think it would be possible to combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, that could work.
SPEAKER_03: I like that.
SPEAKER_01: With a simple command like locate.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And then something very basic.
SPEAKER_01: It could start to be.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: Or before we found.
SPEAKER_03: Is that only going to be within our 200 foot range then?
SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah, I think that's very doable.
SPEAKER_02: The difficulty, what would be in, I think, like you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find.
SPEAKER_02: Can you have something that picks up a voice from far away?
SPEAKER_02: It's a good point.
SPEAKER_02: It's hidden under the couch.
SPEAKER_02: But then again, you have this weathing.
SPEAKER_02: You know, it's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe that could be always activated too.
SPEAKER_00: A little sticky pad to stick on top of your television.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's a sling in to that.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Or an isolated magnet or something like, you know, something that wouldn't interfere.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: The technical thing.
SPEAKER_02: But yeah, I like that.
SPEAKER_02: I like that.
SPEAKER_02: The voice recognition system.
SPEAKER_00: The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control.
SPEAKER_00: So it could be sold to both the younger market, the older market.
SPEAKER_00: The younger market could use kind of the voice control method.
SPEAKER_00: The older market might be.
SPEAKER_00: Exactly, and we might consider that all the market could use this in poor design for the traditional buttons and whatnot.
SPEAKER_00: I was thinking.
SPEAKER_03: I was thinking about the screen.
SPEAKER_03: Sorry.
SPEAKER_03: I'll go ahead.
SPEAKER_03: If we're going to do this touchpad screen thing, do we know if that's an option technically
SPEAKER_00: right now? Definitely an option.
SPEAKER_00: I've looked into a cost of touch screen methods and whatnot.
SPEAKER_00: This seemed to be almost as cheap as a button method at this point.
SPEAKER_03: It seems like an interesting option, especially because then you could have your primary screen just be these four or five basic functions and you have menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition settings, things that you're not going to use every day and that a lot of people aren't going to use.
SPEAKER_03: But it is an option there for this high tech market that sort of is this sleek thing we're going for.
SPEAKER_01: I've got to wonder there for adding so much technology to this one remote.
SPEAKER_01: I was still going to be able to meet a 1250 euro goal for selling these things.
SPEAKER_01: It seems like you're not going to be able to handle all those functions with just one microchip.
SPEAKER_01: The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the whole mechanism.
SPEAKER_01: It's just something to consider.
SPEAKER_02: Absolutely.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Well, yeah, I guess we'll cross that bridge in the later stages of development.
SPEAKER_02: But yeah, no, it's perfectly viable question.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So I'm seeing that we're going to just basically focus on this young demographic.
SPEAKER_02: Aim it at them, but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them, but basically will make a sleek, simple function remote control.
SPEAKER_02: I think this voice recognition thing is we've got a market for it.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think there's too many.
SPEAKER_02: More or less be cornering the market on as well.
SPEAKER_02: We don't have many.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Compared to a lost my microphone.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: We don't have many people.
SPEAKER_02: There's not very many competitors out there that do that.
SPEAKER_02: So cool.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: I guess we've touched on most of this.
SPEAKER_02: I think that I gave a paging function, a touch screen, and face plates.
SPEAKER_02: The thing with I see, would there not be a, we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure that's sincerely correct.
SPEAKER_00: I think you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that kind of has a portion of the device is not interchangeable.
SPEAKER_00: Where is the surrounding portions are interchangeable?
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: We could have the casing.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Back to the, the costs, the material.
SPEAKER_01: We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package.
SPEAKER_01: That's something.
SPEAKER_01: If we're say we're including three or four face plates, this can drive the costs up.
SPEAKER_01: And the other question is, if we don't include them, are we really in a position to evaluate that market?
SPEAKER_01: We haven't done any tests on face plates.
SPEAKER_01: And whether, see, there's even interest out there.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So, the problem ahead, it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, because it would have to, who all, it's not like the cell phones like we have a, you know, Nokia model X and then 10 people make face plates for it.
SPEAKER_02: We just are a model of remote control.
SPEAKER_03: One publicity of a face phone is you have it out and around it is sort of emblematic whereas you're just sitting at home, so unless somebody comes over to watch TV.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Well, hopefully some people have people coming over to watch.
SPEAKER_00: True.
SPEAKER_00: And most people have their television in the living room.
SPEAKER_00: All right.
SPEAKER_02: Well, we can discuss that one further when we think about whether, when we do costs and so forth, true, plastic is dead cheap.
SPEAKER_02: And if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway, yeah, cross-aparge later.
SPEAKER_02: But yeah, we will have to evaluate what's most important.
SPEAKER_02: I think we've had a bit of discussion already on these things.
SPEAKER_02: So do any other questions, comments that came up in these presentations?
SPEAKER_00: Well, have we confirmed that we're going to go ahead with a top screen?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_02: Um.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think that would be best.
SPEAKER_02: Let's based on what you guys have all said to me.
SPEAKER_02: Let's go for a plastic, a plastic case, because that this is easy on the cost.
SPEAKER_02: Try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended.
SPEAKER_02: That's a great idea.
SPEAKER_02: With a touch screen for the basic functions.
SPEAKER_02: And we'll, yeah, but let's provisionally let's go for a touch screen one with several sub menus for possible extra stuff that won't basically put the channel in the on and off switch on the touch screen.
SPEAKER_02: Do we have, wait a minute, it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen, people are going to have to recharge their remote controls.
SPEAKER_02: Yet, at the same time, that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost.
SPEAKER_03: So it would have a docking base?
SPEAKER_02: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_02: Then again, that costs as well.
SPEAKER_00: So it's new within the last 20 years, even with the touch screen.
SPEAKER_00: Do that.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Three or four days.
SPEAKER_03: And we'll somebody buy it if we tell the day.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I don't think, yeah, I can't see anybody buying a remote control that we have to plug in.
SPEAKER_02: So we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So with a touch screen with some kind of, with some cutting edge battery technology.
SPEAKER_00: For 12 year olds.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, well, hey, it's worth looking into.
SPEAKER_02: If not, we can always default to just doing a well presented plastic simple.
SPEAKER_02: You know, well, yeah, I mean, you can put that we could, I don't know, I mean, I suppose we could put the basics on the center, easiest, you know, people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at.
SPEAKER_02: And then the other bits and bobs, you know, go through many.
SPEAKER_02: We'll do the aesthetics.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So look for the touchscreen in the battery.
SPEAKER_02: Focus on presentation.
SPEAKER_02: With this voice recognition option as well.
SPEAKER_02: Just for the simple functions, the on off channels volume.
SPEAKER_02: And a small paging function, even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging, you know, just some kind of simple button that's just, I guess, another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some kind of paging.
SPEAKER_02: Just okay.
None: Right.
SPEAKER_02: So any comments?
SPEAKER_02: Thoughts before we break into going to the next round of individual work on this?
SPEAKER_01: Yes, we're doing touchscreen.
SPEAKER_01: We want to look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the, you know, the actual interface part of it and things like that.
SPEAKER_01: Or is it just going to be one touchscreen for everybody?
SPEAKER_01: Interesting.
SPEAKER_01: What would be on that touchscreen?
SPEAKER_01: Because you said earlier that we have to think about company colors and logo or something or motto.
SPEAKER_01: I can't remember exactly what you said.
SPEAKER_00: We put fashion to the electronics.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's my understanding that if you're going to do a skin, you need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think perhaps it's too much.
SPEAKER_02: Good idea, but yeah, I think that that one might just be, yeah, I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular.
SPEAKER_02: A pda would, that makes a lot of sense for a pda because you're going to be using it to connect up to things anyway.
SPEAKER_02: But I don't know what you guys think.
SPEAKER_01: I think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touchscreen.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, be okay.
SPEAKER_00: I'm in agreement with that.
SPEAKER_00: I'm wondering how we're going to get, you put fashion into electronics.
SPEAKER_03: Well, but if we're going to use a touchscreen where it's going to come on, like on your cell phone, it'll have your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading and then it goes away, perhaps it can be like a temporary, it comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it because it is a bit much to have it engraved on the back
SPEAKER_00: or something. Yeah, true.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm hoping for subliminal, maybe half a millisecond as it turns.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, no, it seems like it would suffice to just have the RR on there.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you would think, but.
SPEAKER_02: Apparently not.
SPEAKER_01: People are going to want their remote to boot up and see flashing things.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's going to be just going to be on ready to go.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Well, fair enough.
SPEAKER_02: Any of that would help the battery life too.
SPEAKER_02: If the remote, they do have to press about it for their remote to turn on.
SPEAKER_02: But then again, who wants to turn on or not control?
SPEAKER_00: Well, you have to do this to turn the screen in on, right?
SPEAKER_00: It'll wake up.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, I'll go into it back to the dormant mode.
SPEAKER_02: Go to the remote mode.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah, I like that.
SPEAKER_02: I like the idea of putting the logo in the boot up screen.
SPEAKER_02: Nice.
SPEAKER_02: Cool.
SPEAKER_02: So any last things before you break?
SPEAKER_02: All right, fair enough.
SPEAKER_02: Sounds good.
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to save the copy of this.
None: You guys need to remind us.
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to save a copy of this and the main set.
SPEAKER_02: I'll do it in a second and put them in the share folder for later reference.
SPEAKER_02: I'll put my files in the share folder.
SPEAKER_02: Brilliant.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: That's fab, guys.
SPEAKER_02: Cool.
