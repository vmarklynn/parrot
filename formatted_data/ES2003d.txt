SPEAKER_00: I think it's not particularly fruit and veggie.
SPEAKER_02: We might have to suffer badly because of it.
SPEAKER_01: Well, it's probably more fruit and veg in most of the things that are fruit and veg, so not four.
SPEAKER_02: Four?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, that's very ambitious.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criteria for being inspired by the fact that we're inspired by current passions.
SPEAKER_00: I can't wait to start with that.
SPEAKER_03: This is their motto.
SPEAKER_02: This is their strategy.
SPEAKER_02: Imagine we had some money invested in this and the amount that we invested is going to be proportional to the marks.
SPEAKER_02: We might want to be a bit more skeptical about this one.
SPEAKER_01: What would you think, yourself?
SPEAKER_02: I would say, I mean, it's not at all.
SPEAKER_02: In any way, shape or form.
SPEAKER_01: It's kind of curved and we can make it yellow.
SPEAKER_01: That's pretty much banana-like.
SPEAKER_02: Yellow banana-like thing is okay.
SPEAKER_01: It's got a curve to it.
SPEAKER_02: Five is that so unreadable?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I got stretching the use of a banana.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
SPEAKER_02: So five, seven, ten, sixteen, twenty-one.
SPEAKER_02: This gives us an average of three.
SPEAKER_02: Well, this would be in the middle.
SPEAKER_02: So it's not bad.
SPEAKER_01: It's only good section.
SPEAKER_01: It's not bad and considering the...
SPEAKER_01: Don't pick up the pen.
SPEAKER_02: Oops, sorry.
SPEAKER_02: I'm sorry.
SPEAKER_01: What do you talk about, please?
SPEAKER_01: I'm glad to sign that.
SPEAKER_01: Considering the price we had to get this in, we'd have a positive, you know, even based on the four of us being heavily biased.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It was going to be quite hard to get anything standing out, I could say, possibly, based on the cost features.
SPEAKER_02: Even if we were to increase this entire thing by seven, we were to go down a grade to four.
SPEAKER_02: We would have to do...
SPEAKER_02: I mean, we weren't that kind of optimistic, too overly optimistic.
SPEAKER_02: You know, like, we didn't add, we didn't subtract our whole seven points from the use of things.
SPEAKER_02: So I think we're definitely on a good bit.
SPEAKER_02: Even if we gave this one seven, this one seven, that's still only three extra points over seven.
SPEAKER_02: You know, it's...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we did...
SPEAKER_02: It was okay.
SPEAKER_00: It was good.
SPEAKER_00: Personally, I think...
SPEAKER_00: Given the product...
SPEAKER_00: Only replaces a single remote control that you already got.
SPEAKER_00: Are people really going to show out 25 euros for something that's only marginally good?
SPEAKER_03: Well, depends here, what the targets people are, like you'd say.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe the fashion conscious...
SPEAKER_03: Maybe women are...
SPEAKER_03: It's yellow.
SPEAKER_03: It looks like a banana.
SPEAKER_03: It's cool.
SPEAKER_03: It's got a look-good in the sit-in room.
SPEAKER_03: Rather than the LCD.
SPEAKER_03: Whereas, more technical, like more people in the device technology, like, it's good.
SPEAKER_03: It's going to LCD screens.
SPEAKER_03: Only got two buttons on their joysticks.
SPEAKER_03: So, which kind of people would be more likely to buy?
SPEAKER_01: Probably the people technologically.
SPEAKER_01: They usually want to buy point and stuff.
SPEAKER_01: I think so.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, my mom still has not learned how to use text messaging on her phone, and she's had it for a long time.
SPEAKER_02: She uses it to make phone calls and that's it.
SPEAKER_03: That's it, mom.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So, I think if my mom's a remote control like this, we're only two buttons and enjoy stick.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, I'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy.
SPEAKER_02: She's like, is this a remote control?
SPEAKER_02: I don't have to use it and stuff like that.
SPEAKER_02: Even if it is really user-friendly to us, but we're used to using menus all the time.
SPEAKER_00: That's one of the things that...
SPEAKER_00: Because it's technically innovative.
SPEAKER_00: For someone who's sort of technophobic and friatic, it simply looks unfamiliar or be daunting.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's totally radical to have a remote control, no numbered buttons.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But like radical, good, maybe.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know how long we've got, at least five minutes, I think.
SPEAKER_01: We will pop on to project evaluation.
SPEAKER_01: So.
SPEAKER_01: We've got these four-crycurity here for satisfaction.
SPEAKER_01: Does anybody want to...
SPEAKER_01: Do you have any opinions on any of them?
SPEAKER_01: For example, or backwards, I suppose.
SPEAKER_01: The ability to work in this project using the technology we've been presented with.
SPEAKER_01: If people made good use of the pen and paper, I would say...
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_02: I would say...
SPEAKER_02: I have no doodles.
SPEAKER_01: Wrote Mary A. Page, but not.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using the digital pen might be.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's a very big digital pen, most of it, but it's a bit of a sector-stable.
SPEAKER_00: It goes into their campus.
SPEAKER_00: It would have been nice to be able to transfer our paper notes onto the computer.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that would have been pretty good.
SPEAKER_01: It does seem like paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes.
SPEAKER_01: So maybe this is literally just the way it ended.
None: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: How are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today?
SPEAKER_02: I like it, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's a little bit of a leadership, as much as it can be leader than this.
SPEAKER_01: There you go.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that one.
SPEAKER_01: Last one we've got is room for creativity.
SPEAKER_00: Well, until accounts came along.
SPEAKER_03: Super creative.
SPEAKER_02: We're not lacking in ideas.
SPEAKER_02: That was not the problem.
SPEAKER_01: I think of, in the end, ideas that can be used and sadly, not so much that we weren't full of ideas, but of ones that are going to allow us to actually build the thing.
SPEAKER_01: It's a bit of a pity.
SPEAKER_01: I would have to agree in that.
SPEAKER_01: I think we needed a larger budget.
SPEAKER_01: If you're going to, in your product, maybe a technological sector, then you can afford to maybe check the price up slightly from what it is, because they will pay what they just cash at the people after that.
SPEAKER_00: I think for retaining the more of a biomarker form and the articulation, would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in added expense.
SPEAKER_03: And the price was twice the assembly cost.
SPEAKER_03: And would it have to be twice that?
SPEAKER_03: It could have had the assembly cost.
SPEAKER_03: It could have had the cost of maybe 50 or...
SPEAKER_03: It could still have a set of 25.
SPEAKER_01: That's true.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I suppose we'll have to be taking up a different group, I guess, as to who the cost involved.
SPEAKER_01: But, I mean, we've got a prototype.
SPEAKER_01: So, I think it's gone okay today considering the information that we...
SPEAKER_01: I just suppose all on the...
SPEAKER_02: Maybe the accounts would have been better if we had a list from...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, to begin with.
SPEAKER_01: Probably would have come up with a lot more solid design in the end, I would have to agree.
SPEAKER_01: It is very much pity to get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some new ideas are just a bit too expensive.
SPEAKER_01: Always hard to tell until you know the costs.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I had a cost with him budget.
SPEAKER_01: There are now that we have a slightly less than capable product.
SPEAKER_01: We evaluated it and we can see that we came out with a value of 3.
SPEAKER_00: Actually, one thing I would say, I mean, something that could perhaps be part of the product.
SPEAKER_00: The product testing and market research process would be to produce more cups of both versions and see just how much of a difference going over budget would make to sales.
SPEAKER_02: Which, unlike respondents from consumers,
SPEAKER_00: we could even market two versions. We keep the version to be nice, I know, but...
SPEAKER_01: And then the final one where you get to call it how, but we'll go into that later.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: Is there anything else that anybody would like to add?
SPEAKER_01: Anything that's not being covered before I quickly write up a final report?
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. I mean, we've got a product. We maybe aren't as happy with it as we'd like to be, but we've got something we think we can maybe stick on to the market and sell.
SPEAKER_01: And of course, something we have been avoiding talking about because we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers.
SPEAKER_01: There's a huge market.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, we briefly touched in a move, no more knowledge, then there's little we can say in that.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So, let's say nobody's got anything they'd like to add.
SPEAKER_01: We can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we need to, and then we can finish up the writing and such.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you for your participation.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: I was actually kind of upset, you know, at the budget, and that we had to cut a lot of stuff.
SPEAKER_02: But man, we can't have the location, everything.
SPEAKER_02: That's fast.
SPEAKER_02: If there may be the prices were made.
SPEAKER_01: That's a question you can ask in a while.
None: Okay.
