SPEAKER_04: is thinking that in the meeting you could like have the secret thing that would play music.
SPEAKER_04: That's your face.
SPEAKER_04: You got bored.
SPEAKER_04: Give you a stock post.
SPEAKER_04: Nobody would know, right?
SPEAKER_04: No, I mean just like no one would know if something's actually coming through if you got bored or something.
SPEAKER_04: I was being recorded anyway.
SPEAKER_02: Why listen to the guy?
SPEAKER_04: You sit at the meeting but you just...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, you just say...
SPEAKER_02: Then we can get this as X marks later.
SPEAKER_02: There are an important things.
SPEAKER_08: So...
SPEAKER_08: You have to turn those things on.
SPEAKER_08: I know already.
SPEAKER_02: There's a switch on top.
SPEAKER_05: On off.
SPEAKER_00: Hi.
SPEAKER_00: Hi.
SPEAKER_00: Channel.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, I want to.
SPEAKER_00: Hello.
SPEAKER_00: Hello.
SPEAKER_00: You are on zero.
SPEAKER_05: The wireless ones are actually labeled.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, they are all good at labeled.
SPEAKER_05: They have a little piece of tape.
SPEAKER_07: No?
SPEAKER_07: Is that the channel number or the mic?
SPEAKER_05: That's exactly the problem.
SPEAKER_05: Subtract one from the mic number to get the channel number.
SPEAKER_08: Or maybe add another one.
SPEAKER_08: No, no, you subtract the number on the mic is the number on the screen plus one.
SPEAKER_08: Of course.
SPEAKER_03: Of course.
SPEAKER_08: Thank you.
SPEAKER_08: Because otherwise...
SPEAKER_05: So I guess I am channel eight.
SPEAKER_03: Whoa, I guess so.
SPEAKER_03: Am I nine?
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: You look not even.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah, I'm number two.
SPEAKER_03: That's right.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_05: Funny, you don't look a day over seven.
SPEAKER_05: Well, thank you.
SPEAKER_00: This is kind of fun.
SPEAKER_00: I guess now we have a lot of sense.
SPEAKER_00: I guess sense of feeling going on.
SPEAKER_04: But it won't last long.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, it's a remarkable thing that I should take people for granted.
SPEAKER_05: Just for your ears.
SPEAKER_07: You can hear the shadow it creates.
SPEAKER_07: Oh, no.
SPEAKER_07: It's like the acoustic shadow from the front.
SPEAKER_07: You can hear it.
SPEAKER_05: You must have much better here.
SPEAKER_05: So far, every meeting I've recorded someone has at one point or another said, oh, I probably shouldn't have said that.
SPEAKER_05: So I think they're...
SPEAKER_02: Maybe we should record someone for your clicks.
SPEAKER_02: I think we should click and click.
SPEAKER_00: But they don't show up.
SPEAKER_00: They sound like that.
SPEAKER_00: Wow, that's great.
SPEAKER_01: They don't show up on them.
SPEAKER_05: Well, I bet they're recorded.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: They're like, sure they're in the red sphere.
SPEAKER_09: They don't show up on them.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I bet they're recorded.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: They're like, sure they're in the red sphere.
SPEAKER_00: They want to do something serious in the clip.
SPEAKER_05: They tend to clip.
SPEAKER_05: But it's a nice user interface to ask.
SPEAKER_05: Very.
SPEAKER_08: What does solo mean?
SPEAKER_08: It means, let's try to think of things they put on real mix so it should have a line.
SPEAKER_08: Oh, I thought it was.
SPEAKER_08: It's pretty good.
SPEAKER_08: The silo actually...
SPEAKER_00: She fit it to the...
SPEAKER_08: So that means you just...
SPEAKER_08: Fiddy throws the head for it.
SPEAKER_08: Because it's actually...
SPEAKER_08: What application can I have for a class method or a class procedure?
SPEAKER_08: So the silo...
SPEAKER_08: Like silo, and if you click on one of the other ones, it clears that one.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, but it doesn't actually do anything else.
SPEAKER_05: It doesn't really...
SPEAKER_08: You can comment it radio.
SPEAKER_03: It's pretty slow.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, can we fast forward to this conversation?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: She can't turn this thing.
SPEAKER_02: Usually cutting the blood flow off the line.
SPEAKER_02: You're going to...
SPEAKER_00: You're going to be saying, you know, funny or something?
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, I think a lot of us ended up wearing it around your neck and then facing up.
SPEAKER_05: And just because there doesn't seem to be a good way to mount it.
SPEAKER_00: That's right.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, boy.
SPEAKER_00: Clearly, I mean, my impression is if I have to work with saying, you know, more than five minutes, I mean, I will be completely affected somehow.
SPEAKER_00: So...
SPEAKER_00: This thing or just that one?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: On the temple, suppression?
SPEAKER_00: It really pressed my...
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It's otherwise my ear channels, otherwise my joints here.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, depending what I put it is basically things.
SPEAKER_00: But that doesn't look fine.
SPEAKER_00: So...
SPEAKER_00: Did you bring this to the form they signed?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So...
SPEAKER_00: I think this thing, of course, is probably, you know, acoustically more challenging.
SPEAKER_00: But I like this.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_05: But this is very comfortable.
SPEAKER_05: I mean, I could wear this for that any difficulty.
SPEAKER_04: Can you convert these ear ones to something comfortable?
SPEAKER_04: I mean, just by...
SPEAKER_01: Do you have so much pressure?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yes.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, we just have to buy new ones.
SPEAKER_04: We have to design this up.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I mean, you can just use the microphone and...
SPEAKER_05: The other way I had it, which might work, is you put one over an ear.
SPEAKER_05: And then you can adjust the other one.
SPEAKER_05: Oh.
SPEAKER_05: And that didn't...
SPEAKER_05: That seemed to be proud.
SPEAKER_00: That doesn't work for you.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Anything which is distracting or painful is going to impact negative.
SPEAKER_05: So you see how Jane's wearing it?
SPEAKER_05: That seems to work okay, too.
SPEAKER_05: But I mean...
SPEAKER_00: And you just have to bring it up.
SPEAKER_00: And that point, it shouldn't be much different to work with you.
SPEAKER_05: Well, except you can bring it quite a bit closer to your mouth.
SPEAKER_08: So, yeah, it's not such a...
SPEAKER_08: It's not such a thing.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, but probably this is designed in such a way that should be closer.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But this is designed to be work like this.
SPEAKER_05: Right, so...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, maybe we should look into if we can buy a replacement with their 80 bucks.
SPEAKER_05: I mean, I really think it's a very...
SPEAKER_00: I mean, if I have to be signed, I think...
SPEAKER_00: I would rather... you'll see stuff like that.
SPEAKER_05: Well, what you'd rather do is nothing at all, of course.
SPEAKER_05: But to get a good quality image, if you're listening to it downstairs, that one's quite a bit lower quality.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, I know it's not.
SPEAKER_00: But, you know, that might be the challenging part.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm stuck in it.
SPEAKER_00: Because I don't know why you were...
SPEAKER_04: If it didn't hurt, you know, if it was comfortable, but you knew it was there, would it bother you?
SPEAKER_04: Well, try this one on.
SPEAKER_04: Because I actually think it sort of makes everybody act a little more professional.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Thank you for that.
SPEAKER_02: Actually, I use something like this from...
SPEAKER_02: From the telephone.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, very comfortable kind of...
SPEAKER_00: See, I mean, I'm kind of more there from this ear, where this is...
SPEAKER_00: I could wear this way.
SPEAKER_00: It's a very high-pitched way, too.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's my...
SPEAKER_01: Of course, there is a little more work to do with this one.
SPEAKER_01: But, no, not too well.
SPEAKER_01: But, if you want something, bring it to that.
SPEAKER_00: You can ask for a campaign animal.
SPEAKER_05: Well, I guess my feeling is that this is for collecting a corpus, not for an actual end user application.
SPEAKER_05: And so, I think a little bit of intrusion is not ridiculous.
SPEAKER_02: Or this for sure, no.
SPEAKER_02: We'll talk about that.
SPEAKER_07: What exactly is the purpose of the corpus?
SPEAKER_05: What's the purpose of the...
SPEAKER_05: Train speech recognition.
SPEAKER_05: Right.
SPEAKER_07: It will train them to the microphone characteristics of this.
SPEAKER_05: So, the point is that if we try...
SPEAKER_05: So, if you are to do it with that...
SPEAKER_05: From the get-go to do it off the PCM, we won't get anything.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: You won't be able to line, you won't be able to segment, you won't be able to do anything.
SPEAKER_04: You won't be able to get funding.
SPEAKER_04: So, right.
SPEAKER_04: No, I'm serious.
SPEAKER_08: You won't be able to show any results.
SPEAKER_00: Right, right, right.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, with this, you're saying you're also in that situation.
SPEAKER_05: Well, I mean, we haven't done the detail experiment, but just from listening to it, it's pretty bad.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, I mean, that's what I like having one of these all.
SPEAKER_05: That's why if you use Dragon Dictator or Vee voice running it as others to do dictation, you need to use these.
SPEAKER_05: There's just no way to add them.
SPEAKER_04: Some people design a comfortable close-talking mic.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, there are too many applications for them not to nod to that.
SPEAKER_05: Well, as I said, I find this one...
SPEAKER_04: I mean, not a little like this, but...
SPEAKER_05: I find this one is no problem at all.
SPEAKER_05: The only thing is...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, it's just...
SPEAKER_05: A little bit of audio, a little bit of audio degradation in one year.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: It's just a little bit of peripheral vision, but other than that, it's not bad at all.
SPEAKER_05: Those on the other hand are very uncomfortable.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, those are...
SPEAKER_03: How much are you fighting this one?
SPEAKER_07: It depends.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's about what we pass out.
SPEAKER_01: You can't even talk to me.
SPEAKER_01: I guess you stood up.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, maybe the problem is we got the kids version.
SPEAKER_08: How we got the definitely fashion, that's...
SPEAKER_08: So, what about this one?
SPEAKER_00: I mean, this one...
SPEAKER_00: I'm sweating.
SPEAKER_08: It's funny, I kind of like this.
SPEAKER_08: I'm actually getting most of the strength from the back.
SPEAKER_08: This one's like a new year.
SPEAKER_04: This would drive me crazy.
SPEAKER_04: Absolutely.
SPEAKER_08: That's a very good one.
SPEAKER_08: That's the most good one.
SPEAKER_08: Yeah, that's...
SPEAKER_08: Well, all of those things I really got this fashion, I think, made something that I didn't know in the show.
SPEAKER_08: And I really liked it, but...
SPEAKER_08: So, it just depends.
SPEAKER_08: I guess you know, I've been using in the war with headbands, but you know, on time, it's all kind of used to that, where it's going to take you guys from back in the year.
SPEAKER_08: That's pain.
SPEAKER_05: Whereas I used...
SPEAKER_05: It's a speech recognition for about four years using one of these.
SPEAKER_05: So, I'm used to this.
SPEAKER_05: I don't use it anymore.
SPEAKER_05: My hands got better, so I stopped using it.
SPEAKER_05: So, for about four years, I used dragon dictate and naturally speaking.
SPEAKER_05: Really, so you could do all my work?
SPEAKER_02: I could do all my work.
SPEAKER_02: I could do all my work.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, it was really a pain.
SPEAKER_05: A pain?
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, but I didn't have a choice.
SPEAKER_05: I mean, I could take...
SPEAKER_00: In terms of the weight, so...
SPEAKER_00: The market is a captive market.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: In fact, when I first came back to grad school, that was a project I wanted to work on, voice environments for programmers, but we couldn't get any funding for it, and my hands got better.
SPEAKER_05: So, that's how I ended up working on this project instead.
SPEAKER_05: Anyway.
SPEAKER_05: So, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So, what are you guys doing?
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: What's your project?
SPEAKER_00: Well, basically, the original project looks a lot like, you know, the... the... your project.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, basically, we set up with this idea of the...
SPEAKER_00: the meeting...
SPEAKER_00: the...
SPEAKER_00: the meeting spaces, in general, and then incarnated in this room that would remediate somehow by, you know, a computer to access information to help along the meeting, and would be like two kind of main functions.
SPEAKER_00: One is the interaction with the computer, which, as you said, you know, you're interaction with the PDA in your case, where you kind of quail it, ask for information, et cetera.
SPEAKER_00: At the same time, our process is somehow, you know, getting all this multi-channel information, doing some sort of, you know, gross channel, you know, cancellation, and transcribing the individual streams, not necessarily in real time.
SPEAKER_00: And the idea is you can eventually, after the meeting, you know, produce new things, and there is all this work on transcription, similar, probably, to what we use before, but with better bandwidth, you know, but worse, you know, in language and the text.
SPEAKER_00: And then, you know, there is all these issues about processing all this information, transcription, but then using, you know, process information to better, segment and point, also using topic segmentation to have better classification of information or extraction of information.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, we didn't dare to say it would be just to have the PDA you throw in the middle of the day.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, this is, this is, that was the, the PDA one is very, very ambitious.
SPEAKER_05: And it's also, it's depending on not only, that, not only does it depend on I-RAM, taping out and working as specified, it also depends on writing vectorized speed recognition algorithms, which is non-trivial.
SPEAKER_00: But, you know, let's assume somehow the processor power is going to be there, whatever. I mean, initially you may be a super computer for this.
SPEAKER_05: Right, me so, so one of our, our back-off policy on that, if, if there's problems with I-RAM, is it will be a wireless link.
SPEAKER_05: Right, you'll dump the, the dump the audio wirelessly to a network somewhere and you do the right recognition.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, we, we kind of set up this concept like a year and a half ago.
SPEAKER_00: And at that time, I said, you know, we don't worry about the compute power.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, it would be some way.
SPEAKER_05: Well, we, we've had a lot of discussions about it.
SPEAKER_05: And I think, maybe, I think, to some extent, it comes down to a religious issue.
SPEAKER_05: My religion is personal computers are good and terminal mainframes are bad.
SPEAKER_05: And so, if you can get away with it, I don't want to have a terminal in my hand in a mainframe somewhere else.
SPEAKER_05: The too many things to cling, cling though wrong and you lack control.
SPEAKER_05: I think the PC revolution is shown how good it is if you can have the power yourself.
SPEAKER_05: And so, the I-RAM project provided us a method of having a very powerful thing in your hand.
SPEAKER_05: And so, we want to see what we can do with it.
SPEAKER_05: But, we also don't want the project to actually completely depend on it.
SPEAKER_05: So, the project will go forward regardless of whether I-RAM works or not.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, our approach somehow, I believe is probably, you know, complementing in many ways, is to focus on the actual deep technology that we have somehow in speech.
SPEAKER_00: Right.
SPEAKER_00: And basically, make progress on, you know, the algorithms.
SPEAKER_00: And then, you know, it would run somewhere.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, as you said, I mean, we like the idea to have it there.
SPEAKER_00: But our focus is basically to develop the algorithms to push the state of the art on this transcription task.
SPEAKER_00: And the other task probably is also, you know, managing the computing, the command control.
SPEAKER_05: Right. So, for us, the meeting recorder project has a very similar approach.
SPEAKER_05: Me personally, from my PhD thesis, I'm sort of doing the other way and seeing how much speech recognition can I do on this little unit.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, I see. You really are a challenge to do that.
SPEAKER_00: To put as much power as you can in the PhD.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah. Okay. Our approach is, you know, we do whatever is necessary to do it.
SPEAKER_00: And, you know, some of it may go into something depending on your experience.
SPEAKER_05: That's right. So, the, as I said, the meeting recorder project.
SPEAKER_05: So, we have people at UW people here working on robust algorithms that will be running on work stations.
SPEAKER_05: And then what I'm trying to do is see how much of it I can put on I RAM.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's eventually you would get all these, you know, higher and higher in powers in these portable things.
SPEAKER_00: So, as long as you have enough algorithms and technology to do something better if you have more processing power.
SPEAKER_00: Right. I mean, the situation now in the speech community is that, you know, there is some boundary, some limit in the performance.
SPEAKER_00: And no matter how much processing you have, you don't even know what to do with it.
SPEAKER_00: You don't need to limit it. Right.
SPEAKER_00: And then you have room to port whatever you can to, you know, smaller devices.
SPEAKER_00: You got to be done in a quick way.
SPEAKER_08: So, the internet.
SPEAKER_08: I was going to say that, you know, in terms of, so Adam has a, you know, a particular agenda.
SPEAKER_08: But obviously, there are also other things. And, you know, it's the way that a project like this works.
SPEAKER_08: And a group like this where we have students coming in, you know, it's meant to be sort of a long term thing that we'll get a stator.
SPEAKER_08: And people will be able to come along and look at different aspects of it.
SPEAKER_08: So, it's not clear, you know, whether someone at UW is going to look at being forming or whatever.
SPEAKER_08: But it's good. It's a good property for us that there are a lot of different things you could do with it.
SPEAKER_08: Well, we haven't thought it through, but that's okay.
SPEAKER_05: Like, as an example, we had a visitor who was working on speaker ID, acoustic change detection.
SPEAKER_05: And he has a very good system for that. And he wants to use this corpus.
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. I mean, he's one of the areas where command went to, like, you know, speaker tracking.
SPEAKER_00: You want to know, I mean, if you have the people wider individually, it's going to be easy.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, it's nice about getting this corpus.
SPEAKER_05: With the people wider, you have an excellent baseline. Right? You have a very easy problem.
SPEAKER_05: And you can get the right answer.
SPEAKER_05: Ground truth very easily. And then you can degrade it by using the PCMs. You can degrade it further by using those things.
SPEAKER_05: And really see what you can do with a real system.
SPEAKER_02: For example, when you go to your PDA system, it's really an awful problem to determine how many speakers there are.
SPEAKER_02: That's right. That's right.
SPEAKER_02: That's actually being a, that's one of the problems that's being addressed at this year's evaluation.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, really? They're doing a taking place on a known number.
SPEAKER_02: Right. You do need to figure out the number of speakers.
SPEAKER_02: Which evaluation of...
SPEAKER_02: This is a NIST evaluation.
SPEAKER_02: The speaker idea.
SPEAKER_02: Right. Speaker verification.
SPEAKER_08: And what's the, what is the data thing?
SPEAKER_08: What is the using? What is the...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, switchboard.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_02: Switchboard.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I mean, people also are in some part of that evaluation too, but probably not that segmentation part.
SPEAKER_02: But I don't know if they are using a different data for that, but I mean, it's a, well, I say switchboard, of course, the Sony two speakers.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But I don't know how they actually went about, because they were saying some, some, some up to eight speakers.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe they, maybe some other data for that part.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_05: I mean, just mixing it wouldn't work because the channel characteristics are two different.
SPEAKER_05: So what we, what we were working on here was parts of broadcast news.
SPEAKER_05: And so that, that's a slightly strange task because they tend to be long segments, but they were, they were parts that were interviews that he worked on.
SPEAKER_02: And, no, we've also done some of that.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, I have a so small hack top system, sort of for the broadcast news determinants, an approximate number of speakers.
SPEAKER_02: And actually assign some names to them.
SPEAKER_02: This is something we did for the Maestro project.
SPEAKER_02: But, yeah, for broadcast news, it works much better actually.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you get very good.
SPEAKER_02: We like to view nice long segment.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_05: Right.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, so I tried his, on his system on the meeting recorder stuff.
SPEAKER_05: But of course, we don't have any trained neural nets or, so, so his system was based on our hybrid neural net system that we use for speech recognition.
SPEAKER_05: And so I was using the broadcast news nets on this data.
SPEAKER_05: So of course it didn't do, didn't do tremendously well.
SPEAKER_05: And then the other problem also was that it doesn't handle overlap very well.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I mean, broadcast news is for this third party listener, right?
SPEAKER_04: Right.
SPEAKER_04: So if you were listening to an interview that sounded like this, you need to turn off your radio.
SPEAKER_04: That's right with all the networks.
SPEAKER_09: So it's just got to, it's a lot easier.
SPEAKER_09: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: I've seen there are some programs in TV.
SPEAKER_00: I'm trying to read this from something like this from public.
SPEAKER_00: There are some.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but they do it somehow.
SPEAKER_00: They clean it up.
SPEAKER_00: You notice that they have somehow with control of mixing, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: For some to pick up.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, there is some program at midnight somewhere.
SPEAKER_00: There is a bunch of like four people discussing.
SPEAKER_00: And it's a lot clean.
SPEAKER_05: Like McLaughlin.
SPEAKER_05: But yeah, they have.
SPEAKER_03: The worst case is politically incorrect, where they don't make any adjustments at all.
SPEAKER_03: It's hard to even follow what they're saying.
SPEAKER_03: It's just, it's really.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I hear that sometimes.
SPEAKER_00: What is, is it okay?
SPEAKER_07: It's still in the format, it's still in the format, which is slightly more formal, I think, than.
SPEAKER_00: So you don't think that you've always been.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, I'm sure they do.
SPEAKER_05: I'm sure they have an audio engineer in the back.
SPEAKER_00: I'm sure they do.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's still, you know, under the name.
SPEAKER_07: The host probably gets, you know, gets a little bit more.
SPEAKER_07: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I feel like that's the one I've seen that show.
SPEAKER_03: It's like, they're sometimes people who totally take over the floor.
SPEAKER_03: And other people are trying to get in.
SPEAKER_03: They can never get access.
SPEAKER_05: Well, but that's different than an audio engineer fiddling with the mixing parameters.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I know that there are periods where two people are talking at the same time.
SPEAKER_00: At the same time.
SPEAKER_03: And you're only able to hear parts of the weaker voice.
SPEAKER_03: You know, it's a style.
SPEAKER_03: I've seen debates where, you know, it's apparently engaging people.
SPEAKER_03: It's been going on for a while.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, in many cases, it's not what man is to speak on top of.
SPEAKER_04: I was thinking if transcriber were to mention Italy or something, it would have been indoling multiple.
SPEAKER_04: I'm not.
SPEAKER_04: I'm not.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not.
SPEAKER_05: I'm not.
SPEAKER_05: Good with saying it.
SPEAKER_05: So what do we do?
SPEAKER_05: Well, I mean, it seems like there's a lot of overlap.
SPEAKER_05: I mean, I would be pleased to have the story to overlap.
SPEAKER_00: It's a lot of overlap.
SPEAKER_00: Basically, it takes advantage of that to make a synergy.
SPEAKER_00: I believe each group has, you know, deaths in different areas.
SPEAKER_00: So, I mean, we clearly need to collaborate.
SPEAKER_05: So is your intention to start collecting some meeting data?
SPEAKER_00: I, you know, there are no final, I mean, the official decisions, I guess, have to be made in terms of resources to that.
SPEAKER_00: My personal opinion, if you ask, is that we should, because the only way, I mean, if I learn anything on speech, you, for the last, more data is better.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, you need a task to really, you know, improve your system for that particular environment.
SPEAKER_00: So right now, we are focusing our research on doing evaluation, type of, you know, incremental improvements.
SPEAKER_00: So, switchboard, for instance, we have five, is kind of, okay, you have two people talking, it's the closest thing.
SPEAKER_00: But we really should move into the data that reflects as much as possible, the real scenario.
SPEAKER_00: And that's the way to improve.
SPEAKER_00: And then you do implement on that particular database.
SPEAKER_00: So even if we don't collect the data to train more, we should collect data at least to evaluate.
SPEAKER_05: So what would be nice is if we could converge on formats and conventions
SPEAKER_04: and software, I mean, just like rewriting this transcriber tool and that shouldn't be re-done.
SPEAKER_04: And it shouldn't be done.
SPEAKER_01: So, it's a possibility that somewhere else is going to, you might contract out to do the transcription.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, we're talking about that right now.
SPEAKER_05: We should say about it so that there's some possibility that we're going to get a third party company to do the transcription for us in exchange for the corpus.
SPEAKER_07: Is that an exchange for access to the corpus?
SPEAKER_07: Right.
SPEAKER_00: So, one question, this thing is also for you made on Internet funding?
SPEAKER_00: I mean, I know you're applying for something.
SPEAKER_05: We have a little bit of DARPA under the communicator project.
SPEAKER_05: So, that's part of it.
SPEAKER_05: And then part of it's on the IRAM group.
SPEAKER_05: IRAM group is paying for part of it.
SPEAKER_05: And then part of it's just XE General Funds is paying for it.
SPEAKER_07: Do you think some of the infrastructure is the AT&T video?
SPEAKER_05: The infrastructure, yeah, they were paid, but they don't expect anything in return.
SPEAKER_05: They're just being very nice and good neighbors.
SPEAKER_05: And so they basically wanted stuff anyway.
SPEAKER_05: And then they just sort of allowed us to direct the audio portion of it to what we needed.
SPEAKER_04: And then UW, I don't know if you mentioned this at the beginning, but so Mari's group, Mari and Morgan, I think would happen historically.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know how much it's supposed to say if this is being played.
SPEAKER_04: Well, anyway.
SPEAKER_04: Just go recording.
SPEAKER_04: This is with me, what are going on?
SPEAKER_04: There is something.
SPEAKER_08: The whole is if you want to say something that's sensitive.
SPEAKER_04: It's no, it's okay.
SPEAKER_04: I'll tell you later.
SPEAKER_04: Sorry, listen.
SPEAKER_04: And you are listening audio.
SPEAKER_05: You're listening.
SPEAKER_00: Too bad.
SPEAKER_00: You know, many thousands of people are listening to this.
SPEAKER_00: It does hurt me.
SPEAKER_00: Because it's in the future.
SPEAKER_00: It's a truly chalice.
SPEAKER_00: It's like a pineapple.
SPEAKER_04: It's like a pineapple.
SPEAKER_04: But you have to...
SPEAKER_04: That's right.
SPEAKER_03: Normally a no-taker would know.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I can do it say, la la la la la.
SPEAKER_07: But that's only on one spot.
SPEAKER_04: Anyway, UW is getting some funding from DARPA, on communicator with, and that's sort of how I got involved, me Morgan wanted me to sort of do something.
SPEAKER_04: I guess my interest is sort of in the language and dialogue modeling and the turnover lapse and how to apply, you know, a language model, a dialogue model, to actually feed down to do better recognition.
SPEAKER_04: So not just...
SPEAKER_04: Because I think it will be really difficult to do just speech recognition and then try to get some kind of meaning out of it.
SPEAKER_04: I think you have to have some kind of structure...
SPEAKER_04: Feedback.
SPEAKER_04:...from the...
SPEAKER_04: I mean, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And so knowing that an utterance is really short and low volume, you should be able to figure out it's a back channel and things like that.
SPEAKER_04: Anyway, apparently, and you guys know more than I do, there was some talk that you were going to build a portable version of this so that Mari's group...
SPEAKER_04: I mean, there's not a huge amount of funding in the way Mari probably won't be able to do a ton of collection.
SPEAKER_04: But I was thinking if there were sort of prototype...
SPEAKER_04:...collection devices or standards, then we could share data.
SPEAKER_04: And we would have like a monopoly on that...
SPEAKER_04: I mean, once you get three sites, collecting data, and each site can demo and say it's at the other two sites.
SPEAKER_04: Which would be really good for funding purposes.
SPEAKER_04: But I don't really know what that's what I heard.
SPEAKER_08: Yeah, we talked about that.
SPEAKER_04: And according to Morgan, it's like happening.
SPEAKER_05: Well, when I spoke with him, he really just said it was a money issue.
SPEAKER_05: That it's certainly not any sort of intellectual property issue we're perfectly willing to give people those boxes, the boxes are cheap.
SPEAKER_05: But can they afford to get a six channel Sony wireless?
SPEAKER_05: And can they afford the PCMs?
SPEAKER_04: And he said something about a portable...
SPEAKER_04: You know, they wouldn't have a dedicated room or something like that.
SPEAKER_08: I think somebody's got a unit which is something like the A-dap or something.
SPEAKER_08: It's a device which will record on the table, multiple channels.
SPEAKER_08: And so I think that was going to be...
SPEAKER_08: And we would like someone actually has this knocking around.
SPEAKER_08: This is...
SPEAKER_08: It was going to lend it to us something like this.
SPEAKER_05: This is the same company that may be doing the transcript for us, maybe giving us...
SPEAKER_05: It might be a different company.
SPEAKER_08: It also has apparently purchased a very big multi-channel thing.
SPEAKER_08: And so if we could lend us that, we could imagine doing these kinds of recordings.
SPEAKER_08: I mean, you know, like you say, the fundamental thing is...
SPEAKER_08: It doesn't have to be this hardware.
SPEAKER_08: You can have multiple channels synchronized later.
SPEAKER_08: And then the post-processing can be uniform and...
SPEAKER_04: Right. And it doesn't have...
SPEAKER_04: You know, different sites can do different pieces of it, I think.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah. And it would also be really nice to be able to do it in other rooms.
SPEAKER_05: Because otherwise we're going to learn a lot about this air conditioning.
SPEAKER_04: And you'll get different kinds of conversations and different interactions.
SPEAKER_04: And I think just having three different sites...
SPEAKER_04: That'd be great.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, great.
SPEAKER_04: It's for sort of diversity.
SPEAKER_01: So... Well, one thing that Arasio hadn't mentioned is...
SPEAKER_01: You were talking about the same sort of idea of just collecting a meeting and...
SPEAKER_01: And looking at it afterwards.
SPEAKER_01: But the thing that I'm interested in, and I'm probably the one who's going to start doing the collection, is having this situation where people are talking to each other and talking to...
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01:...the computer in the machine, in the room.
SPEAKER_01: And... So that's probably...
SPEAKER_01: That's certainly what's going to come out of our group first.
SPEAKER_05: So are you going to... Is there going to be some sort of mark for that?
SPEAKER_05: I mean, are they going to say, computer, bring up a web page on?
SPEAKER_01: Well, so what we're basically doing is waiting to look at the pilot and see what people want to do.
SPEAKER_01: But it's going to all be Wizard of Oz first.
SPEAKER_01: So we're going to let them do what they want to do.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, I see.
SPEAKER_05: I'm just thinking from a discourse point of view, it'd be very interesting to somehow mark...
SPEAKER_05: I'm talking to the computer.
SPEAKER_04: But you know what? They don't see when they stop.
SPEAKER_09: Right.
SPEAKER_04: They don't say, you know, I'm done computer.
SPEAKER_04: They only mark the beginnings.
SPEAKER_07: Well, there might be a different style of...
SPEAKER_05: The computer showed me a web page on X return.
SPEAKER_01: This is exactly the things that I'm interested in.
SPEAKER_08: When you're starting and when you're...
SPEAKER_08: It really was an intelligent assistant sitting there.
SPEAKER_08: You could say, well, perhaps the computer could show us this.
SPEAKER_08: And you'd be told to someone else, but the computer's meant to be listening.
SPEAKER_08: It means me.
SPEAKER_08: Are you talking to me?
SPEAKER_04: But there might be...
SPEAKER_04: Need ways you can do this that are not natural, but they become very easy.
SPEAKER_01: So I think hell.
SPEAKER_01: So, right. So we want to look exactly those sorts of things.
SPEAKER_01: Of us, at least the beginning, is going to have a number of different characteristics.
SPEAKER_01: It's not going to be natural. It's not going to be a regular meeting.
SPEAKER_01: It's going to be an artificial situation because we're going to have to mock up some back end.
SPEAKER_01: So the kinds of speeches...
SPEAKER_01: Speech is going to be slightly different.
SPEAKER_01: People are going to be in an unnatural path.
SPEAKER_01: We're going to be trying to figure out how they're going to...
SPEAKER_04: But you can still collect the multiple microphones in a two-hour-hour-hour-hour.
SPEAKER_01: But we will now, you know...
SPEAKER_01: So they'll have all this.
SPEAKER_01: That'd be cool.
SPEAKER_01: All the microphones set up all the same.
SPEAKER_08: Well, that's the question.
SPEAKER_08: If we are collecting these at different sites, different kinds of tasks, different people, what is it that's going to be uniform about this collection?
SPEAKER_08: Right.
SPEAKER_08: And part of it will be, well, this combination of close talking and environmental mics.
SPEAKER_08: And then part of it will just be the data presentation.
SPEAKER_08: If we have common transcription standards, then it's all transcribed to...
SPEAKER_08: There's some integration of the standards.
SPEAKER_08: But I mean, as long as that makes sense, then it's nice to have a variety of tasks, right, to have sort of be a different...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and if your task is to just sort of, you know, generally do summary and large vocabulary speech recognition, everything, then it doesn't matter that much, which...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And having the idea of a computer sort of in there forces you to create a log file format that can handle these other devices, I mean, you were talking about the pen.
SPEAKER_04: And so I think it's...
SPEAKER_04: The formatting is really one of the biggest...
SPEAKER_05: XML, that solves everything.
SPEAKER_04: Not the transcribed formatting, but the auto formatting and the sort of figuring out how to synchronize all of these pieces.
SPEAKER_04: That's right.
SPEAKER_04: And what kind of software you can use for post-processing all of them?
SPEAKER_05: Right, someone will make some assumption that's different than someone else, and then we certainly won't be able to operate.
SPEAKER_07: Just to stop people making different assumptions.
SPEAKER_07: Yeah, quite an interesting problem.
SPEAKER_07: Yeah, quite an interesting issue.
SPEAKER_05: So that's something we should try to...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: I'm not sure what...
SPEAKER_05: I mean, what's a good solution then that other than trying to keep in touch with each other?
SPEAKER_08: Well, if we're gonna have...
SPEAKER_08: We're gonna have those options to share tools, right?
SPEAKER_00: We could have like, you know, some periodic meetings.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, or meetings like this with...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, I mean, meetings like this are good because we can actually record them.
SPEAKER_00: At the same time, we contribute to it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, absolutely.
SPEAKER_00: Absolutely.
SPEAKER_00: Collection.
SPEAKER_04: And...
SPEAKER_04: Even if we don't make any decisions, we'll have to say.
SPEAKER_00: But it will be all documented.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, actually we could do that at our site too, even though it's not what I'm normally gonna mean.
SPEAKER_01: But there's no reason we can't collect that, and then you'd have a more...
SPEAKER_05: What kind of meeting...
SPEAKER_05: When you're talking about your artificial meetings, they are gonna be goal-directed though, so they're gonna say you're having a meeting to do this.
SPEAKER_01: You're supposed to, yeah, you're supposed to...
SPEAKER_01: You're a budget meeting or something, and you have a spreadsheet up there, and everybody has to sort of work out some particular goal of where to put the allocate money, and they can ask the computer to switch things around in different columns or something like that.
SPEAKER_01: But everybody asks, so actually another characteristic is that we're only dealing with three people.
SPEAKER_01: So that will be different.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so...
SPEAKER_01: So, city people...
SPEAKER_01: We're gonna start with just three people, yeah.
SPEAKER_07: Is that the channel limitation cutting in?
SPEAKER_01: I think it's mainly...
SPEAKER_01: It's partly channel limitation, because we want to...
SPEAKER_01: We want to double-mic everybody.
SPEAKER_01: It's also to a large extent, and we have a channel.
SPEAKER_01: It's also, I think, sort of what came up, I think when the evening was involved a while ago, and Christine, I think, just in terms of the thinking of the subjects and trying to have enough people, we sort of want to do, you know, encourage everybody to talk, try to figure out some way that everybody would be able to participate.
SPEAKER_05: So, you're double-miking everyone, so that's a close talking, and a lapel, and then two environmental mics, is that right?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that was the idea.
SPEAKER_01: But, I don't know, we're not planning to do anything with all that right away, so if there were...
SPEAKER_01: We're happy to take input on that.
SPEAKER_01: Well, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So, I very much want to find out the specs and the board that you have in the PCI card, because I think we might want to go with that.
SPEAKER_03: I want to ask a question.
SPEAKER_03: So, is it the same three people each time or different?
SPEAKER_01: No, no, we're helping you just bring in different groups of the three people of peace.
SPEAKER_07: And do you have the same agenda, although there's a goal?
SPEAKER_07: Is there one goal or several goals?
SPEAKER_07: Is that going to be a more interesting date?
SPEAKER_07: In the given meeting.
SPEAKER_07: I mean, a budget meeting is a classy example,
SPEAKER_01: where every time we're trying to do is not make it too artificial, you're not like, say, okay, let's roleplay, you're going to do this.
SPEAKER_01: But rather, give them an actual task.
SPEAKER_02: They're definitely a problem solution kind of thing, where they would actually, you know...
SPEAKER_02: So, they have to come to one...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and they all just have their own...
SPEAKER_01: They just happen to have their own opinions.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, another possible thing that we're thinking of is something like, you know, we have these regular Wednesday lunches, and you've got a plan on menu, right?
SPEAKER_01: So, everybody has things that say like...
SPEAKER_01: People speak with their mouth full.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I do.
SPEAKER_00: But a lot of right.
SPEAKER_00: That is...
SPEAKER_00: We need that part.
SPEAKER_01: No eating during the evening.
SPEAKER_01: I guess.
SPEAKER_01: Or drinking.
SPEAKER_01: You're still elevating everything with the food.
SPEAKER_05: You're still getting coffee on these is definitely a bad thing.
SPEAKER_00: So, one question.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, I haven't been in this, you know, preliminary decision meetings.
SPEAKER_00: But I don't know what's the idea for the computer interaction.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's going to be a real computer, it's a visa.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so the idea is, we want to start off with a somewhat simple back end, thinking of agentifying and Excel spreadsheet and having some kind of spreadsheet.
SPEAKER_01: So basically, people will see a spreadsheet and they can ask it to move numbers around.
SPEAKER_01: So, we thought that it would be a useful kind of task for a budget meeting.
SPEAKER_00: And so, would we really compute the code?
SPEAKER_01: So, starting off, we would start off definitely with a Wizard of Oz task.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, so real computer, but someone driving it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_01: But everything would be an agent.
SPEAKER_01: And so, we wouldn't have the recognition grammar to begin with but these are all components that are obvious to us how to build.
SPEAKER_00: Nothing that's sort of far in the future.
SPEAKER_00: So somebody would be playing the recognized and then other agents will be doing their task independent.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_01: So, sort of, right, something that can be built up relatively quickly and makes sense how to do.
SPEAKER_01: So, a fairly simple back end.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, I think that's close enough to what we're interested in that it would be useful for training the acoustic models without any question.
SPEAKER_00: You plan to train actually more?
SPEAKER_00: Oh, absolutely.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, because if you don't, the accuracy is going to be horrendously bad.
SPEAKER_07: But this is just training them using the head mounted data initially.
SPEAKER_07: Or, I mean, the tension to do both.
SPEAKER_07: I mean, the tension to do both.
SPEAKER_08: I think the idea is to train on these mics but use these to get the alignments that are being understood.
SPEAKER_07: Okay, understood.
SPEAKER_07: You're not intending to do any, you said you weren't planning to do any beamforming, but you're not intending to do any signal processing or a sort of acoustic modeling of the environment until microphones or anything else.
SPEAKER_05: It was really my interest at the moment.
SPEAKER_05: It will really depend on if we have someone who really wants to do that.
SPEAKER_08: Well, I suspect that in paint we may not be able to get anywhere without doing something.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Well, just as an example, I've done some very simple digits recognitions where I said, if I had known we were having this meeting, I would have done this before, having people redigit strengths because digits are much easier.
SPEAKER_05: And just combining, just doing mult-
SPEAKER_01: Starting off with digit stuff too. Yeah, of course.
SPEAKER_01: For a different, for this, some end point things.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: But just mixing the, just doing multi-stream on the different mics helped enormously.
SPEAKER_05: And I was a little surprised.
SPEAKER_05: Right.
SPEAKER_05: So you're having, why?
SPEAKER_05: Why?
SPEAKER_05: I have no idea because they're a little different.
SPEAKER_08: So you mean to...
SPEAKER_08: You mean to...
SPEAKER_08: The microphone, though?
SPEAKER_08: You mean to combining the posterios on full-band recognition from three different portfolios?
SPEAKER_08: Right.
SPEAKER_08: Right.
SPEAKER_05: Cool.
SPEAKER_05: And that actually helped.
SPEAKER_05: That gave several percent improvement.
SPEAKER_07: Right.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Absolutely.
SPEAKER_05: But I think just having stereo will help because they're a little different.
SPEAKER_05: You get a little slightly different estimators and you combine them together and you do a little better.
SPEAKER_00: So basically, if you run on really training, collecting a database for training.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, you're talking about 20,000 or 40,000 synthesis.
SPEAKER_00: Things like that.
SPEAKER_08: Right.
SPEAKER_08: So that the tens of thousands of days, tens of thousands of hours.
SPEAKER_05: So our initial plan for XE was to do 40 hours.
SPEAKER_05: And then UW was talking about doing an additional 60 to 100 hours if they have the money.
SPEAKER_04: That.
SPEAKER_04: If they can actually do it.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, that's pretty...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, that's what they had said before.
SPEAKER_05: But I guess that was more ambitious.
SPEAKER_04: They were going to...
SPEAKER_04: There was a difference in the amount of money awarded in the beginning.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, the thing too is, I mean...
SPEAKER_03: What does that mean?
SPEAKER_03: If you have the equipment, then...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, recording is easy.
SPEAKER_05: You can get different things.
SPEAKER_04: Recording is easy.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, recording is easy.
SPEAKER_05: Right.
SPEAKER_01: It's transcription.
SPEAKER_01: That's the other thing.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, but you have to put on a mic.
SPEAKER_08: I hope you run it.
SPEAKER_08: We're out of mics.
SPEAKER_08: I can be mic.
SPEAKER_08: Not quite, but...
SPEAKER_08: You can have my mic.
SPEAKER_08: Don't switch mics.
SPEAKER_08: Don't switch mics.
SPEAKER_05: Don't switch mics.
SPEAKER_05: That's the way you're confusing.
SPEAKER_00: So, I mean, clearly, if everybody's collecting data to train them...
SPEAKER_01: One thing I should find out is that we were not planning on doing transcription of the full thing right away.
SPEAKER_01: Because that's not...
SPEAKER_01: I was initially interested in just the speech that was directed at the computer.
SPEAKER_01: And so, when we're not planning on doing transcription, I think...
SPEAKER_01: But if you had the data...
SPEAKER_01: Yes, we had a company that...
SPEAKER_01: A company.
SPEAKER_05: I didn't know whether I should name the company that may be providing us transcription or not.
SPEAKER_00: If you've not done the same thing, it's been very naturalistic.
SPEAKER_04: But there will be a lot of people-to-people talk in those meetings, I bet, with even three people.
SPEAKER_04: So, what's the company?
SPEAKER_04: IBM.
SPEAKER_05: So, we've been trying to work with them for a while on these projects.
SPEAKER_05: And it's hard for them to give us money.
SPEAKER_05: But they seem to be willing to give us time.
SPEAKER_05: And so, one of the potentials is for them to do transcription in exchange for access to the corpus.
SPEAKER_00: So, basically, it seems to be like...
SPEAKER_00: I mean, if everybody was in the university collecting data, you are sharing data and making a bigger corpus.
SPEAKER_00: It would be great.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I bet if you'd put it over there.
SPEAKER_04: Yes, absolutely.
SPEAKER_04: I think that would be excellent.
SPEAKER_04: And it will really help the design too.
SPEAKER_04: It will keep it from being too specific to somebody's setup or test.
SPEAKER_00: Sure, I'm sure you're right.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, sure.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, sure.
SPEAKER_05: Morgan says thumbs up.
SPEAKER_08: But how valuable, given that you're interested in this computer data, we're not going to have any of that.
SPEAKER_08: Well, that's me personally.
SPEAKER_01: Our group in general, as Arasio is saying, is also interested in some of the same general issues.
SPEAKER_01: Well, and I think that...
SPEAKER_01: And I'm also interested in the prosody used over person-to-person stuff, like segment and helping for segment.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, so we have some ideas there, but not enough data to try.
SPEAKER_04: So, Harry and Kamala and I probably.
SPEAKER_04: So, actually, having different kinds of conversations is really helpful to...
SPEAKER_04: To make these models robust.
SPEAKER_04: You don't want to train in just a few people's voices, because they just learn the...
SPEAKER_04: They're a prosotic pattern, it's not what we want.
SPEAKER_05: So, how are you going to get ground truth on that?
SPEAKER_05: So, we should...
SPEAKER_04: That is from the transcription and from the speaker's segmentation.
SPEAKER_04: That's not hard.
SPEAKER_04: I think the hard part is getting enough training data.
SPEAKER_04: You also need normalization data, so you're sort of iteratively normalizing as you go through that.
SPEAKER_05: But anyway, what I was going to say is that, although we're not going to have speech directed to a computer, my expectation is that the acoustic models will be very similar.
SPEAKER_05: The language model is probably won't be.
SPEAKER_04: Actually, the acoustic may not be either.
SPEAKER_04: So...
SPEAKER_04: Really?
SPEAKER_05: If it's Wizard of Oz, I think it will be.
SPEAKER_05: If they know that...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, if it's very good, that's true.
SPEAKER_04: If it makes mistakes, it'll be different.
SPEAKER_05: The language model would certainly be different.
SPEAKER_01: We're going to be using the same thing that we've done in the past, which is, you know, we need a natural language grammar written anyway.
SPEAKER_01: It's written in the notification grammar framework.
SPEAKER_01: But with context-free grammar, power, and so it's just changed directly into something that recognizes, recognizes off of directly with no...
SPEAKER_01: And you're going to hand-code that?
SPEAKER_01: It's hand-coded because we need to write the natural language grammar anyway to understand.
SPEAKER_01: So it's a small, unique structure.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, I have structure.
SPEAKER_01: I see.
SPEAKER_05: So, yeah, that's...
SPEAKER_05: Right, if you want to interpret it, you don't need to do.
SPEAKER_01: If we're going to be able to interpret it, then...
SPEAKER_01: I mean, if we're not going to be able to interpret it, then it's not going to do us much good anyway to recognize it.
SPEAKER_01: So we might as well go directly from the natural language grammar.
SPEAKER_03: Is it going to be like an HBHG?
SPEAKER_01: It is a unification-based.
SPEAKER_01: It's not as theoretically bound as HBHG, in particular, although the couple of people that we have working on have HBHG back now.
SPEAKER_05: So what's your timeframe look like for doing meetings?
SPEAKER_05: Actually, starting to record some.
SPEAKER_00: I guess...
SPEAKER_00: It's all up to when I have freedom.
SPEAKER_00: Is anybody else fun working on this?
SPEAKER_00: Well, indeed.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, most people, you know, after this evaluation and confidence, should be working on these type of things, at least.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I know they're working on immediate spaces, but there's a lot of aspects of it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but eventually, I mean, would be people working on kind of recognition aspects and, you know, and an encore technology.
SPEAKER_00: So I mean, recognition technology and also core algorithms, etc.
SPEAKER_00: And for those people to have this data would be, you know, the best way to develop the systems too.
SPEAKER_05: Well, the reason I'm asking is that it's certainly better to get in early with standards and data formats and conventions.
SPEAKER_01: So we haven't collected that's actually why I call this meeting.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah, it's like excellent.
SPEAKER_04: You're both working on it and with, you know, different sampling rates.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, that's right.
SPEAKER_05: I mean, just just agreeing on a sampling rate and a number of bids and a header format.
SPEAKER_01: One thing you do know is we're all producing this sphere file.
SPEAKER_01: It's better in the 16-bit 16-bit solar.
SPEAKER_01: 16-bit solar.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and the amazing thing is that you've been living in the entire way through.
SPEAKER_01: We're actually using very very similar stuff.
SPEAKER_04: Well, I just made that up.
SPEAKER_04: But that was coincident.
SPEAKER_04: But you have different, you were going to have different, you know, hardware.
SPEAKER_01: We actually have quite similar hardware.
SPEAKER_01: It's similar, but not quite the same.
SPEAKER_05: So I think probably the biggest thing would, well, no, that wouldn't be true.
SPEAKER_05: If you're not going to transcribe it yourself, then you're not going to care too much about our transcription conventions.
SPEAKER_04: Actually, that's the transcription conventions I was talking about this with Jane.
SPEAKER_04: It's really important to people, at least like me, who want to know certain, who are looking at aspects that are sort of, they're not words, but they're structural things you're trying to recognize.
SPEAKER_04: And also, I guess, for the speaker, people interested in the speaker separation, because what you call a turn, and the end of a turn, is that it's horribly confused if you don't sort of...
SPEAKER_04: It's inherently hard.
SPEAKER_04: And so you have to make some simplifications, and different people make different simplifications.
SPEAKER_04: And then you can't compare them at all, which is what the literature is sort of like now.
SPEAKER_04: And then there's the issue of recognizing dictionaries in non-standard forms and things like that that have to be mapped.
SPEAKER_04: So gun-overs is going to, and that kind of thing.
SPEAKER_01: Right, and all those issues I'm sure we...
SPEAKER_01: They're not hard.
SPEAKER_01: I'm personally not interested in those for my particular aspect of the project, but SRI in general.
SPEAKER_01: But we definitely will be interested in some language.
SPEAKER_01: And maybe we will, and I'm transcribing stuff.
SPEAKER_01: If Orassia wants that done, maybe I'll be...
SPEAKER_04: And UW is also probably going to be interested in that too, but dialogue kinds of things.
SPEAKER_05: So it seems like if you and Jane...
SPEAKER_05: So if you and Jane keep in touch about transcription conventions, that would be very helpful.
SPEAKER_04: That's originally we should thank Jane, because that's how I originally showed me some transcripts.
SPEAKER_01: It's kind of amazing too, that the transcription tool we just converted on this thing.
SPEAKER_00: All these things...
SPEAKER_00: We were also thinking about the same tool.
SPEAKER_01: But what if you had like...
SPEAKER_01: We set up the tool already.
SPEAKER_04: Written the tickle clues or something.
SPEAKER_04: That's right. Both done the same.
SPEAKER_08: Well, I mean, in some ways that does change the economics of doing that.
SPEAKER_05: Right. It's much more worthwhile to do if someone else is going to use it.
SPEAKER_05: Although again, if this now named company is the one who's going to do the transcription, I suspect they have in-house tools that they'll end up using.
SPEAKER_04: But you still need something that can display these channels.
SPEAKER_04: Right. We need something better than what it can do.
SPEAKER_04: And then I guess who's the contact at UW?
SPEAKER_04: Morgan doesn't have a microphone, but is it...
SPEAKER_04: That's all right. He can talk anyway.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, Marie and...
SPEAKER_03: He could be reached by the far field.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's just...
SPEAKER_04: Marie or Caterine or Jeff or...
SPEAKER_04: Oh, have you done it?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah. I think both Jeff and Caterine have some time on this.
SPEAKER_04: No, on the DARPA project, who would be sort of context for...
SPEAKER_06: Let's start out assuming Marie.
SPEAKER_04: And if Marie is too busy then...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think that's also...
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
None: Marie, Marie.
None: I'd be on the phone.
None: The idea on the phone.
SPEAKER_06: The idea on the phone, basically, is against it.
SPEAKER_06: So, just as you were probably talking about it,
SPEAKER_05: I was. Basically, this proposal is Marie.
SPEAKER_06: I'd be on the phone.
SPEAKER_06: Marie and us, this funding, actually a pretty small amount.
SPEAKER_06: It's funded.
SPEAKER_06: But the most revealing thing to us was the way that we came through this translation.
SPEAKER_06: And I was intentionally using this in the work that I was...
SPEAKER_06: And they heard me on the day that...
SPEAKER_06: They didn't have to wait for their proposal process to go through, because since they were interested in supplying this to us, we just asked for that.
None: And we'll cost them anything.
SPEAKER_06: And they said, I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_06: So, as far as I know, we are...
None: I have to do it.
SPEAKER_06: It's just a question of people in our hands, and people in our hands, talking about what our mechanics have, and then what they just have.
SPEAKER_06: So, we had never mentioned this.
SPEAKER_06: There are nice stuff too.
SPEAKER_06: But I think there's...
SPEAKER_06: As long as everybody's fine...
SPEAKER_06: Excuse me for further, because we might have already talked about this.
SPEAKER_06: As long as everybody's fine with the data being basically free.
None: And the people in our hands should be...
SPEAKER_06:...at least we can talk about it.
SPEAKER_06: And I think that very least all the people in our hands, as well, that's the same thing you guys have,
None: that you can have in the United Kingdom. I don't think we have any problem.
SPEAKER_01: We had certainly in our proposal that we tried to make the NSF.
SPEAKER_01: We were assuming we had distributed the stuff to the LDC.
SPEAKER_00: LDC is what we were thinking.
SPEAKER_00: Because it's a bootstrap.
SPEAKER_00: There is no LDC database.
SPEAKER_00: At least we have to show the data.
SPEAKER_00: That's it.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, I think eventually LDC could be very interested.
SPEAKER_04: And especially if you have a tool that can do this.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, there isn't one.
SPEAKER_04: And the data.
SPEAKER_04: So maybe we can actually...
SPEAKER_04: You can sell corporate eventually to the LDC.
SPEAKER_04: And you can get time, student time, to clean up the corporate facilities.
SPEAKER_06: That's very hard for me.
SPEAKER_06: It certainly wants everybody to tell them why they don't have to go to the online.
SPEAKER_06: So we should talk with that kind of thing.
SPEAKER_06: Just by the way, we made it up.
SPEAKER_06: It's percent of the swing that is right.
SPEAKER_06: It's like, everyone can tell that it's a couple.
SPEAKER_06: It's seems like that kind of problem is getting the idea.
SPEAKER_06: That's the thing that's not going to be the problem.
None: Right?
SPEAKER_08: I want to ask you one question about the nature of design.
SPEAKER_03: Given that the overlaps are up to the level of the system.
SPEAKER_03: Overlapse are up where the difficulty comes.
SPEAKER_03: And there are a bunch of big areas.
SPEAKER_03: Whether it would be useful to have some of the sessions have like an additional rule.
SPEAKER_03: Where in a person, you know, that there's someone who recognizes people to speak or something like that.
SPEAKER_03: To cut down on that.
SPEAKER_03: So you then have a meeting context.
SPEAKER_03: You have multiple channels.
SPEAKER_03: You have a microphone varying the way you want them to vary.
SPEAKER_03: But you cut down substantially on the overlap.
SPEAKER_03: It wouldn't be for all meetings.
SPEAKER_03: Whether maybe just sprinkle through there once in a while.
SPEAKER_03: Something like that might be useful enough.
SPEAKER_08: This one's raised that.
SPEAKER_08: I mean, it's difficult because you wanted to be real space right.
SPEAKER_08: And it says not clear how well people can even adjust to that kind of rule.
SPEAKER_01: If that's the rule.
SPEAKER_01: Those kinds of things are sort of the kind of thing that we were thinking of trying.
SPEAKER_01: Because we are having, we do have a more artificial environment again.
SPEAKER_01: We're trying something totally new, having people speak to the computer.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think we talked about that in particular because we haven't done any pilots.
SPEAKER_01: We haven't seen this incredibly difficult data overlapping.
SPEAKER_01: But this is Christine Hellerson, who's working on this with me from this aspect of user usability and stuff.
SPEAKER_01: She's interested in these sorts of things.
SPEAKER_01: What can you ask people to do that they can reliably do and without too much cognitive load?
SPEAKER_01: That can help things out or those sorts of issues.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe something that could fit easier in our context than in general meeting context.
SPEAKER_03: What I think that.
SPEAKER_03: What I say is that sometimes, if we were to have this kind of coordination thing, some of the overlap is due to someone wanting to claim the floor at a certain point.
SPEAKER_03: Without knowing that other people had the same desire at the same point in time.
SPEAKER_03: And if you were to have someone who was like a moderator, that you raise your panel, a lot of the new person, you know, or you have a partner.
SPEAKER_01: You're bringing the buzzer.
SPEAKER_03: And I think there are always going to be back channels that I think are natural and lovely.
SPEAKER_03: But these overlaps that are due to people not knowing other people want to leave in at the same time and want to coordinate.
SPEAKER_03: I think that they could be lessened in not one way.
SPEAKER_05: There are certainly formal meeting settings where that's what happens.
SPEAKER_05: That, you know, where our fits rules, a order and all that.
SPEAKER_05: So that's not something we had thought about before.
SPEAKER_05: But I think it certainly is another type of meeting that could be done.
SPEAKER_05: I know I didn't know we were going to be recording this meeting.
SPEAKER_05: So I didn't know.
SPEAKER_05: I didn't know.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, in the other meetings we have.
SPEAKER_05: And they've been collecting digits too.
SPEAKER_05: So that's another thing we should talk about is making sure that we're doing it in the same way.
SPEAKER_05: Different reason I see.
SPEAKER_01: So I, I...
SPEAKER_01: And not within, not within the big room, just, uh...
SPEAKER_06: Yeah, I mean, in our case it was just that everything, everything at every level of this test is difficult.
SPEAKER_06: You thought we'd be one part of it.
SPEAKER_06: I didn't know.
SPEAKER_06: Some of the data is like...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, if I had known here we have all these new speakers.
SPEAKER_05: I could have gotten lots of digits in.
SPEAKER_04: But sorry, so you connect, you collect digits in conversation or...
SPEAKER_05: No, no, I have people read them.
SPEAKER_08: We give people a list of digits and they have to like, put them into that discussion.
SPEAKER_08: Seven.
SPEAKER_08: I can't...
SPEAKER_04: I can't reach to you now, just...
SPEAKER_04: I'll just switch.
SPEAKER_04: Never mind, I'm getting a chance.
SPEAKER_04: I have a blank tape.
SPEAKER_06: I guess, and the idea was just that we would have some data, the different speakers with our field microphone effects.
SPEAKER_06: So, we could look at our field of process in close...
SPEAKER_04: So you don't need the meeting for that.
SPEAKER_04: You can just sit me in this room and set up all the microphones.
SPEAKER_04: But you need the room and the setup.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, right, right.
SPEAKER_01: So we're doing digits.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we're not doing digits in the room setup, but we're doing it for complete...
SPEAKER_01: I mean, one of the specific things I'm interested in is knowing...
SPEAKER_01: It's the open mic issue when you're talking to a computer, knowing when you're done speaking.
SPEAKER_01: And so I'm interested in looking at Prozody.
SPEAKER_01: And so we're just doing lists of digits to see when people pause to know...
SPEAKER_01: There was a big gap in time here, but we can tell, exactly, they weren't done.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's the...
SPEAKER_06: Here, we have the same group of people here, as we're doing, but also...
SPEAKER_06: You have the same room setup, you have the same microphone setup, and how you have something...
SPEAKER_06: Actually, usually...
SPEAKER_04: I think that's a really good idea.
SPEAKER_08: But there is also this fascinating Prozody in the Amazon, because what we have is, like, these lists of 10 digit strings, or 20 digit strings, and they're like one to five or one to seven digits.
SPEAKER_08: And people read through them and you know, we're saying, well, we want to be able to separate them, so please pause between those.
SPEAKER_08: But it's very people don't like doing that.
SPEAKER_08: And so there is this Prozody thing, which is indicating when...
SPEAKER_08: The pauses between the digit strings, and then when they finish, they actually hold a sheet.
SPEAKER_08: There's this nice one.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it's rolling, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: You definitely shouldn't use your last sample.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, people that do proselyt, they add a few at the end, because otherwise people will...
SPEAKER_04: I hadn't even thought about throwing out the last couple.
SPEAKER_04: That's definitely true.
SPEAKER_04: That is beautiful, because then you can get this F0 floor for each of the speakers.
SPEAKER_01: Just like a dry vest.
SPEAKER_04: Just like the right vest.
SPEAKER_04: Don't throw it away, but don't use it in the training.
SPEAKER_04: You're John Reiner.
SPEAKER_04: Training, do you?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: No, that's a really good idea to have some standard...
SPEAKER_04: I mean, especially if the different sites can do something like that.
SPEAKER_04: You'll at least be able to see whether difficulty across site is due to, you know, the likes of conversion.
SPEAKER_08: Right, that'd be a common, that'd be great.
SPEAKER_06: Yeah.
SPEAKER_06: I was actually curious at the first time, I was going to tell you about this stuff that you did to have some help in.
None: But after I had to sleep, I don't think I should have that.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, you should definitely...
SPEAKER_04: It's some kind of calibration for many of these.
SPEAKER_05: The only thing I don't like about it is that it's not phonetically very rich.
SPEAKER_04: Well, you could have TI, you know, she put her dirty laundry...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, that's right.
SPEAKER_04: Clean vest, or whatever.
SPEAKER_05: So we actually talked about that.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, it's plenty bad.
SPEAKER_05: It's plenty bad just with digits.
SPEAKER_05: Although I haven't trained any nets on it.
SPEAKER_05: I've just been using existing digits or broadcast news nets since we don't have enough data yet.
SPEAKER_01: What are the digits strings of from TI?
SPEAKER_05: 1782313784.
SPEAKER_05: That sort of thing.
SPEAKER_05: It's actually a lot of different things.
SPEAKER_08: They vary from...
SPEAKER_08: It is actually the actual digits strings from TI digits.
SPEAKER_05: I just extracted exactly the same ones.
SPEAKER_04: Have we all memorized it?
SPEAKER_05: That's like the timid sentences.
SPEAKER_05: Greasy wash water.
SPEAKER_07: Just do it.
SPEAKER_05: But so I have a bunch of tools for generating these and for helping transcribe them.
SPEAKER_05: Since you know what the transcript is, you don't have to type it in, you just have to segment it.
SPEAKER_05: So I have tools for doing that.
SPEAKER_05: Using x-waves, tickle-tk, purl, and maybe some c-programs to...
SPEAKER_03: They could do some digits.
SPEAKER_05: Well, I don't have any of the pronounce.
SPEAKER_05: I print them out as I need them.
SPEAKER_05: So what I should do is just print out a whole stack
SPEAKER_08: and leave them up here, but I haven't done that. That's what I was wondering.
SPEAKER_04: Right, I'm writing something on the board.
SPEAKER_04: It's a different task.
SPEAKER_05: It's a different task than a red.
SPEAKER_05: You do it differently if it's sitting in front of you and you're reading it then if it's not.
SPEAKER_05: So I guess we could write them down and then read them.
SPEAKER_05: But...
SPEAKER_05: We can get digits.
SPEAKER_05: I mean, as you said, we don't have to be in a meeting.
SPEAKER_05: And so if we're short on digits, I can just capture people in the hallway, drag them in here and have them read digits for it.
SPEAKER_05: That's right.
SPEAKER_03: I want to ask about also the air conditioning.
SPEAKER_03: Is there a plan to turn the air conditioning off and some of these meetings?
SPEAKER_04: That's way too cold in here.
SPEAKER_08: You can't turn it off on that thing right there.
SPEAKER_05: Well, the hum we hear right now is actually the projector, not the air conditioner.
SPEAKER_05: The projector is much louder than the air conditioning.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, but I was just thinking he was showing
SPEAKER_03: on what he showed us on the website. You could see the contribution of the air conditioning.
SPEAKER_03: And I just wondered if that was going to be sometimes.
SPEAKER_01: But the projector is not part of your meeting, or is this normal going to be on during the night?
SPEAKER_05: No, not normally.
SPEAKER_05: Not for our meetings.
SPEAKER_05: At least very few of the ones we've done have we had to do anything on the computer.
SPEAKER_01: For hours at will, but we have a rear projector.
SPEAKER_07: It actually gives you a way of calibrating microphone position in a way.
SPEAKER_07: That's right from volume.
SPEAKER_05: That's interesting.
SPEAKER_07: The volume is a point source pretty much.
SPEAKER_05: Although unfortunately, you know, they're all pretty close.
SPEAKER_05: Right.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, look, digits, drinks.
SPEAKER_04: My technology.
SPEAKER_04: See, you may want to call up your computer.
SPEAKER_04: Computer, give us digits, drinks.
SPEAKER_04: That's right.
SPEAKER_08: Wow, but the recolidious crash.
SPEAKER_08: I don't know.
