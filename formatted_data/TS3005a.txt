SPEAKER_00: Oh, goedmorgen, alles goedmogen.
SPEAKER_00: Goed moeiting.
SPEAKER_00: Ik wil je de eerste meeting welkom te willen.
SPEAKER_00: Ik heb een beetje een presentatie.
SPEAKER_00: Mijn neem is Marijn Plomf.
SPEAKER_00: En ik hoop dat je het een paar minuten in hetzelfde is.
SPEAKER_00: Ik ben de projectmanager van deze project.
SPEAKER_00: En, well, ik wil je vertellen wat het is.
SPEAKER_00: Dit is de agenda voor de eerste meeting.
SPEAKER_00: Dit is de opening.
SPEAKER_00: Dan we hopen, we hopen, we get acquainted to each other.
SPEAKER_00: We'll do a little tooltraining with these two things.
SPEAKER_00: We'll take a look at the project plan.
SPEAKER_00: There will be time for discussion.
SPEAKER_00: Actually, we have to discuss, because we have to create a product.
SPEAKER_00: And then we will close this session.
SPEAKER_00: Maar, first of all, we'd like to introduce you to this room.
SPEAKER_00: As you probably have noticed, there are a little black fields on the table.
SPEAKER_00: You have to put your laptop exactly in that field.
SPEAKER_00: So the little cameras can see your face.
SPEAKER_00: There are cameras everywhere around the room, especially here, for your face coordinates.
SPEAKER_00: And this isn't a pie.
SPEAKER_00: It's a set of microphones.
SPEAKER_00: And there are microphones here also.
SPEAKER_00: Please don't be afraid of them.
SPEAKER_00: They won't hurt you.
SPEAKER_00: Well, as said, I'm the project manager, and I'm hoping for a good project.
SPEAKER_00: And I'd like to hear who you are and what your functions are on this project.
SPEAKER_00: Let's start with the ladies.
SPEAKER_01: I'm Imkudio.
SPEAKER_01: And my function is user interface design, I think.
SPEAKER_01: So that's me.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, I'm Vaseline Nemare.
SPEAKER_03: I'm the industrial designer.
SPEAKER_03: And I hope to look forward to a very pleasing end of this project.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so my name is Danny Mangrel.
SPEAKER_02: I'm a marketing expert.
SPEAKER_02: My job is in the company to promote the company, to promote products to the customers.
SPEAKER_02: So I also hope we have a pleasant working with each other.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, well, we have some expertise from different pieces of the company.
SPEAKER_00: That's good.
SPEAKER_00: Well, as said, we're working on a project.
SPEAKER_00: And the aim for the project is to create a new remote control, which has to be original, trendy, and of course, user-friendly.
SPEAKER_00: And I hope we have the expertise to create such a project.
SPEAKER_00: The way we hope to achieve that is through the following methods.
SPEAKER_00: It consists of three phases, namely the functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design.
SPEAKER_00: As you can see, all of these phases consist of two parts, namely individual work parts and a meeting where we will discuss our work so far.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, but first, I will tell you something about the tools we have here.
SPEAKER_00: I already talked about the cameras and microphones, but they are not of much use to us.
SPEAKER_00: We will have to take advantage of these two things.
SPEAKER_00: They are smart boards.
SPEAKER_00: As you can see, you can give a presentation on them.
SPEAKER_00: And this one here is a white board.
SPEAKER_00: And I will instruct you about that soon.
SPEAKER_00: As you also noticed, this presentation document is in our project folder and every document you put in this folder is possible to show that here in our meeting room.
SPEAKER_00: And there are available on both smart boards, but I think we will mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder.
SPEAKER_00: As you can see, this is the same toolbar as it's located here.
SPEAKER_00: The most functions we will use will be to add a new page.
SPEAKER_00: To go back and forward between pages and of course to save it every now and then.
SPEAKER_00: And this is the pen with which you can draw on the board.
SPEAKER_00: For instance, like this, everything is okay, but first I put it on the pen.
SPEAKER_00: You see, I'm new to it too.
SPEAKER_00: And then you can write things like test or whatever you want.
SPEAKER_00: As you can see, you have to move it a little bit slow.
SPEAKER_00: It's not such a fast board.
SPEAKER_00: It's a smart board, but also a slow board.
SPEAKER_00: But you can write things and of course you can also, when you click here, erase things.
SPEAKER_00: So we have a test left.
SPEAKER_00: And you can also delete an entire page, but we ask you not to do that.
SPEAKER_00: Just simply create a new one and start all over because we want to save all the results.
SPEAKER_00: Does everyone understand this?
SPEAKER_00: So you can't erase anything.
SPEAKER_00: Well, you can erase it with the eraser, but you shouldn't delete an entire page.
SPEAKER_00: Just create a new blank one.
SPEAKER_00: I will delete this one out because we don't use it yet.
SPEAKER_00: But you can of course erase when you make a mistake, but don't delete entire pages.
SPEAKER_00: And you can also, let's see, I think it's here, change the color of your pen.
SPEAKER_00: For instance, take a blue one and change the line with five.
SPEAKER_00: And that's what you will need for our first exercise because I'm going to ask you to draw your favorite animal.
SPEAKER_00: It's also to get to know each other because I'm asking three things for that drawing.
SPEAKER_00: To do it on a blank sheet with different colors.
SPEAKER_00: And I just showed you how to pick a color and also with different pen widths, which I also showed you.
SPEAKER_00: And favorite characteristic can be just one word.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I'm not very good at drawing, but I will go first and try to draw.
SPEAKER_00: Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing.
SPEAKER_01: It's a sheep.
SPEAKER_03: That's a seal.
SPEAKER_03: Beaver.
SPEAKER_00: Well, it could be everything.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe when I put on this thing, it could be a turtle snail or a snail.
SPEAKER_00: Or the snail doesn't have legs.
SPEAKER_00: Or the turtle has. And those are slow.
SPEAKER_00: And I hope our project group will not be slow, but we will work to a good result and do it as fast as we can.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Time for another animal. Would you like to go next?
SPEAKER_02: No problem.
SPEAKER_02: That was forward.
SPEAKER_01: That's good.
None: That help.
SPEAKER_03: To make it a little bit easier.
SPEAKER_02: It should gear up.
SPEAKER_02: Like that cute.
SPEAKER_03: Or dinosaur.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's easy to recognize.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the favorite character is that the long neck can reach everything.
SPEAKER_02: And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project.
SPEAKER_02: So that's my favorite animal.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Anything else you need to write?
SPEAKER_00: Oh, another more.
SPEAKER_03: Toll.
SPEAKER_01: Toll.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Good.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: So I can draw with this.
SPEAKER_02: Wow.
SPEAKER_03: That's a must.
SPEAKER_03: Bunny-rather.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: One more.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: You can guess what it is.
SPEAKER_01: I hope.
SPEAKER_01: It's a rabbit.
SPEAKER_01: And well, it's a quick, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: That's my favorite animal.
SPEAKER_00: And a final drawing.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I draw a drawing.
SPEAKER_03: A dolphin because of this intelligence.
SPEAKER_03: One of the most intelligent animals in our world.
SPEAKER_03: Dally-hub.
SPEAKER_03: Dally-hub.
SPEAKER_03: I'm sorry.
SPEAKER_03: Eerator.
SPEAKER_01: You can try it.
SPEAKER_01: The eraser now.
SPEAKER_03: Then.
SPEAKER_03: Perfect.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Well, thank you very much.
SPEAKER_00: I can see we have some drawing talents.
SPEAKER_00: What did you draw?
SPEAKER_00: A drawing.
SPEAKER_00: Well, nice animals, nice words.
SPEAKER_00: Sounds good.
SPEAKER_00: Back to business, back to the money part.
SPEAKER_00: From the finance department, I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of 25 euros.
SPEAKER_00: And we're hoping for a aim of 50 million euros.
SPEAKER_00: And we're hoping to achieve that by aiming for an international market.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Well, it's time for some discussion.
SPEAKER_00: I've wrote down some examples here of what we can speak about.
SPEAKER_00: What's your experience with remote controls?
SPEAKER_00: What kind of ideas do you have to design and you remote control, maybe, for which market segments should be aimed?
SPEAKER_00: Or should we aim for all segments?
SPEAKER_00: Well, actually, I'd like to hand the word back to you.
SPEAKER_00: What's your experience with remote control?
SPEAKER_03: A lot of buttons.
SPEAKER_03: A lot of buttons, which you don't use.
SPEAKER_03: Complex.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Not user friendly.
SPEAKER_01: You need to search for the buttons which you want to reach in the...
SPEAKER_02: Boring.
SPEAKER_00: Boring.
SPEAKER_00: Not fun to use in remote.
SPEAKER_00: Black or black.
SPEAKER_03: So, black colors.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, maybe we should try to make it fun.
SPEAKER_03: We use batteries and last batteries and poor signal.
SPEAKER_01: But we have a lot of remote controls.
SPEAKER_01: Different remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Different remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Different devices.
SPEAKER_01: But we can integrate them or something.
SPEAKER_03: For the use of different devices.
SPEAKER_01: Your stereo and your TV, you know.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, but then again, you still have a lot of buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, but it's a possibility to put those buttons behind some kind of perfection.
SPEAKER_03: So, if you only get the freedom when you need them.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_02: It's possible.
SPEAKER_02: So, did you get the...
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_01: Did you just give it to me?
SPEAKER_03: For example, you get the same size remote control you use every day.
SPEAKER_03: The usual buttons such as a zapping, let's go to the Dutch.
SPEAKER_03: And the following control are only the possible buttons to use directly.
SPEAKER_03: Or the numbers.
SPEAKER_03: The numbers, of course.
SPEAKER_03: But not the buttons used to search on the channels on your television.
SPEAKER_03: Young used those first time or play balls.
SPEAKER_00: So, maybe a minimalist design.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think so.
SPEAKER_00: It was one of buttons.
SPEAKER_01: So, you should make sure that you have every button they need on it.
SPEAKER_01: That's a...
SPEAKER_01: Things for a daily text.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know that.
SPEAKER_03: A daily text?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, that's it.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So, you don't want to bother people with loads of buttons.
SPEAKER_00: But on the other hand, they need many buttons so they don't have to get out of their seat.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Because I think markets will be all kind of people, all the elderly, young people.
SPEAKER_01: If it's international, you should look in...
SPEAKER_01:...think in Britain, they have different things they can do with TV.
SPEAKER_01: Or so that you can choose what you want to see.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if you should take that in consideration.
SPEAKER_01: It's just for the normal TV.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think that's better because...
SPEAKER_02: I think if you're going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only Britain, then...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, because we'll rise higher than 1250, I think.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I don't know if the TV is better to use the whole world and Britain.
SPEAKER_03: No, I think the main idea of this remote control is...
SPEAKER_03:...to make it user friendly.
SPEAKER_03: So I think when the customers will buy this remote control, they already have a remote control which companies...
SPEAKER_03:...with the standard remote control which comes with a television.
SPEAKER_03: So it only has to have the most used buttons.
SPEAKER_03: You don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television.
SPEAKER_01: Then you have to find your other remote control buttons to search.
SPEAKER_03: But it's impossible to accommodate all the buttons on the different televisions sets on one remote control.
SPEAKER_03: It's impossible.
SPEAKER_03: For example, Sony Television has the opportunity to make it possible for one side of the screen teletext on the other side.
SPEAKER_03: Just regular television.
SPEAKER_02: I think the most television nowadays do this.
SPEAKER_03: They don't use the same signal on remote control because you can't use a Panasonic remote control on a Phillips television.
SPEAKER_02: Then you have to choose the...
SPEAKER_02:...always with a universal remote.
SPEAKER_02: You have to choose a code.
SPEAKER_02: Which type of television you have.
SPEAKER_02: There's no problem.
SPEAKER_02: I think the two pages on the same screen, like teletext and normal television, that's nowadays standard.
SPEAKER_03: I think the most people will buy the remote control because they lost the first one.
SPEAKER_03: The first one is broken.
SPEAKER_03: Perhaps they have a better television.
SPEAKER_03: So that option is not...
SPEAKER_03:...optional for those people.
SPEAKER_01: If you look into the future, then they want to...
SPEAKER_03:...experience the phone.
SPEAKER_03: So we should take that in consideration.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, well, any more ideas?
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_00: Think I'll come up.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, yeah, well, we have some time.
SPEAKER_00: Let's see, what more I have to tell you.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think there's much left.
SPEAKER_00: We're starting to close.
SPEAKER_00: Our next meeting will start with a little bit early, but our next meeting will start in 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_00: In the meantime, there's time for some individual actions.
SPEAKER_00: As you can see, the different roles have different tasks.
SPEAKER_00: And there's a ping.
SPEAKER_00: Is it my laptop?
SPEAKER_03: Stop the meeting.
SPEAKER_00: We'll close it in five minutes and the meeting.
SPEAKER_00: The marketing expert will take a look at the user requirements specification.
SPEAKER_00: The user interface designer will work out the technical functions design.
SPEAKER_00: And this was the interface designer or the interaction designer.
SPEAKER_00: No, the interaction designer.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, first this was right.
SPEAKER_03: We'll take a look at the working design.
SPEAKER_00: Is it built the interaction?
SPEAKER_00: Industrial design.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, let's just use the acronyms.
SPEAKER_00: And of course, specific instructions will be sent to you for your personal coach.
SPEAKER_01: So I should look at what you should be able to do with your mouse or how?
SPEAKER_00: Well, those instructions will be in the email you will receive shortly.
SPEAKER_01: I hope.
SPEAKER_00: And of course, you have your own expertise.
SPEAKER_00: That was what I had to say.
SPEAKER_00: Are there any more questions?
SPEAKER_00: No.
SPEAKER_00: No? Okay, well, I think then we have had back to our offices.
SPEAKER_00: And start working.
SPEAKER_02: I have one question.
SPEAKER_02: One question.
SPEAKER_02: Where does it say we have to make a remote?
None: Because I presume.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, go ahead.
SPEAKER_02: Did it know who?
SPEAKER_02: Well, okay, no problem.
SPEAKER_00: I hope that everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive shortly.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, well, we'll see you all in about 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, thank you very much.
SPEAKER_02: I'll go ahead.
None: You want to follow?
SPEAKER_03: Okay, let's go.
None: Okay, this way.
None: Okay, let's go.
None: Okay, let's go.
