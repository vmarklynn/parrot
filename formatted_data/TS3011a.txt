SPEAKER_03: Good morning, Florentine.
SPEAKER_03: Good morning.
SPEAKER_01: Marketing experts.
SPEAKER_00: All right. Are you ready?
SPEAKER_00: You should put the laptop right into the square.
SPEAKER_00: For the camera.
SPEAKER_00: For the camera.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Good morning, Smelstein.
SPEAKER_02: Good morning.
SPEAKER_02: Mr. PN.
SPEAKER_02: How are you today?
SPEAKER_00: I'm fine.
SPEAKER_02: How was your business trip to Boston?
SPEAKER_00: Well, actually.
SPEAKER_00: I didn't go.
SPEAKER_00: I didn't feel like it.
SPEAKER_00: Do you want to open it?
SPEAKER_00: That's redownly.
SPEAKER_00: I guess I should close it here.
SPEAKER_03: You have the same message of Windows Connection.
SPEAKER_01: I'm so happy to have a flight.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, stand by.
SPEAKER_03: Close the window.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. The waiting is for our marketing expert.
SPEAKER_00: Root.
SPEAKER_00: Root.
SPEAKER_00: Project.
SPEAKER_00: Kick off.
SPEAKER_02: Is there a schedule for this meeting?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, there is.
SPEAKER_00: Actually.
SPEAKER_00: I will...
SPEAKER_00: This is the agenda for today.
SPEAKER_00: For this meeting.
SPEAKER_00: Good morning, Root.
SPEAKER_00: It's important.
SPEAKER_00: Shall we close the door?
SPEAKER_00: Yes. Great.
SPEAKER_00: It's important that the laptops are exactly on the square.
SPEAKER_00: For the cameras.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: We're here to develop a new product.
SPEAKER_00: I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it.
SPEAKER_00: And this is the first meeting to generate some ideas about it.
SPEAKER_00: Root.
SPEAKER_00: Root is here as the marketing expert.
SPEAKER_00: Root is here as the user interface designer.
SPEAKER_00: And Sebastian is here in the role of industrial designer.
SPEAKER_00: Is that correct?
SPEAKER_00: That's correct.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: We're going to do a little tool training for the tools we are going to use during the meetings we are going to have here.
SPEAKER_00: Then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan and we will have a discussion.
SPEAKER_00: This meeting should take no more than 25 minutes.
SPEAKER_02: So we should keep that in mind.
SPEAKER_02: Is there any room for a little presentation?
SPEAKER_02: Maybe during the discussion?
SPEAKER_02: There is.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, there is.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: No problem.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, this new product we are going to develop.
SPEAKER_00: It is remote control, a television remote control.
SPEAKER_00: And first of all, it should be original, it should be trendy and user friendly.
SPEAKER_00: Those are kind of easy goals.
SPEAKER_00: And I am sure we can find more goals for the product we are going to develop.
SPEAKER_00: We will discuss later on more ideas about how the remote should look and how it should function.
SPEAKER_00: And all those kind of things.
SPEAKER_00: The market.
SPEAKER_00: We should have a look at the market.
SPEAKER_00: We are going to use a project method during this development, which consists of three different design stages.
SPEAKER_00: The functional design, the conceptual design and the detailed design.
SPEAKER_00: All of these stages mean that we do some individual work, prepare, and then meet to discuss our...
SPEAKER_00: The progressions?
SPEAKER_00: The progressions, yes.
SPEAKER_00: The first stage, the functional design, we are going to search for the user requirements.
SPEAKER_00: And we will make a specification of that.
SPEAKER_00: The second is the technical functional design.
SPEAKER_00: What effect should the remote have?
SPEAKER_00: Well, in this case, control the television, I think.
SPEAKER_00: And the last one is the working design.
SPEAKER_00: How exactly does it work in the technical sense?
SPEAKER_00: The other design stages, we will discuss that later.
SPEAKER_00: So we'll keep it with the functional design.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Before we think about remote control, we will work with some of the tools we have here.
SPEAKER_00: As you see now, I can give a presentation.
SPEAKER_00: It's also possible to use this one as well.
SPEAKER_00: You can display two presentations as you want to.
SPEAKER_00: To present it to show us a file, you'll need to place it in your project documents folder, which is on your desktop, at least it should be.
SPEAKER_00: Then we have this electronic whiteboard system.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I will show that now.
SPEAKER_00: You can draw on the board using this pen.
SPEAKER_00: There are little sensors, so do not grab it here with a little bit more to the end.
SPEAKER_00: It's on the eraser now, so we click the pen button.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so not too fast writing.
SPEAKER_00: You can insert a new slide or a whiteboard file by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button.
SPEAKER_00: It's quite the same.
SPEAKER_00: All our smartboard notes should be kept in the same file.
SPEAKER_00: So do not make a new file, just use this one during the day.
SPEAKER_00: You can use the eraser to make something go away.
SPEAKER_03: We'll use the same whiteboard file.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: We can work together on it while we're using it in the meetings.
SPEAKER_00: In the meetings, only in the meetings.
SPEAKER_00: It's really like the regular whiteboard.
SPEAKER_00: You can choose the format.
SPEAKER_00: Sorry.
SPEAKER_00: Let me see.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I guess it's maybe because I'm not ben selected.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Current color.
SPEAKER_00: You can choose not a color.
SPEAKER_00: For example, black and you can choose the line width.
SPEAKER_00: So now I have a different line width and color.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Quite easy if you do have any questions.
SPEAKER_00: I wrote down the documents should be in the project documents folder if you want to discuss it with us.
SPEAKER_00: As a little training, I will ask Ruth first to draw your own animal on a new slide with a different color and a different line width.
SPEAKER_00: Then the one now selected.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And then I'm all.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: It's a bunny rabbit.
SPEAKER_00: A rabbit.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Well, great.
SPEAKER_00: Could you do the same, please?
SPEAKER_00: Of course.
SPEAKER_00: But a different animal with a different color and a different line width.
SPEAKER_00: So, Sebastian is thinking about the animal.
SPEAKER_02: Just guessing what should be my favorite animal.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I'm thinking about it too.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Well, it looked more than a bunny than a cat, but it works, right?
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: I'm guessing a horse.
SPEAKER_03: With a very small legs.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not very good in drawing.
SPEAKER_03: You should feed that to the animal.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I guess you get the ID.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Beautiful.
SPEAKER_00: Beautiful.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So, you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to.
SPEAKER_00: Any questions?
SPEAKER_00: Well, just let me know.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Back to our project.
SPEAKER_00: The remote control we are going to develop.
SPEAKER_00: We will have a selling price of about 25 euros.
SPEAKER_00: The profit we are looking for for this product is 50 million euros.
SPEAKER_00: Which is quite a number.
SPEAKER_00: We will focus internationally.
SPEAKER_00: So, the product will be sold if there is market interest in more than one country.
SPEAKER_00: And the production costs should not be more than 12 euros 50.
SPEAKER_00: So, we should keep that in mind during the development.
SPEAKER_00: Because, well, those are important numbers.
SPEAKER_00: Then, the discussion.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: I have some technical issues, which I would like to present to you.
SPEAKER_02: Before we start the discussion, because there might be some.
SPEAKER_02: Influencians.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: First about my role, role of the industrial designer, I would like to think about the implementation of things and the technical possibilities and impossibilities.
SPEAKER_02: So, if someone of you comes up with ideas, I will try to translate them in technical functions.
SPEAKER_02: But there might be some impossibilities.
SPEAKER_02: So, that's one.
SPEAKER_02: And I also will propose some.
SPEAKER_02: Some implementations for that.
SPEAKER_02: But, well, these are quite the same.
SPEAKER_02: Sorry about that.
SPEAKER_02: And I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities, which are available, and which might be interesting to implement in our product.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I have some initial ideas about some things, which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming discussion.
SPEAKER_02: One thing about interoperability.
SPEAKER_02: I think modern remote control shoots control a device, diverse subset of equipment, for instance, DVD player, cell phones, video and audio equipment.
SPEAKER_02: So, one remote control for audio equipment.
SPEAKER_03: For cell phones?
SPEAKER_02: Well, there should be some interoperability between them.
SPEAKER_02: I think it can come in handy.
SPEAKER_02: We should discuss that.
SPEAKER_02: And we should think about the way how these things should communicate with each other.
SPEAKER_02: We're not living in the 1980s anymore, so infrared is not really...
SPEAKER_02: not really hard technical stuff anymore.
SPEAKER_02: But you should think about things like Bluetooth.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but the infrared is, well, a little bit old-fashioned, if you would call it that.
SPEAKER_03: But old-to-feeds are equipped with infrared.
SPEAKER_03: Well, you can not all.
SPEAKER_03: So, that's the most of them.
SPEAKER_03: Or you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one.
SPEAKER_02: But that's something we should discuss about everybody should think about it.
SPEAKER_02: So, that's just my role.
SPEAKER_02: I'll just give you everybody some technical input.
SPEAKER_02: And I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what the product should be and how it should look.
SPEAKER_02: But take these things into account when you start the discussion.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so the main point you are telling us are focused on the interoperability.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: And one remote control should control one or more pieces of equipment.
SPEAKER_02: And the way of communicating with these equipment.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, good.
SPEAKER_00: That was your presentation.
SPEAKER_00: That's it.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, great.
SPEAKER_00: I'll go back to my own presentation.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: I do think it's time now to discuss some things.
SPEAKER_00: Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implications.
SPEAKER_00: There are other things like how to make it trendy, which is I think most routes roll.
SPEAKER_00: The way how it should be controlled by the user, which is a rule during this part.
SPEAKER_00: So, let's start with you.
SPEAKER_00: How do you think the remote should function for the user?
SPEAKER_03: Well, I add a few things in mind.
SPEAKER_03: Well, the interoperability, just like Sebastian said, remote should work on different TVs or even different devices.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just a new store.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: I think it should be for Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So, we're going business to consumer.
SPEAKER_00: It's not a...
SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: I have to fail in making this product for a specific vendor.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: We're just developing this product and we want to set it to a very broad public.
SPEAKER_02: So, we should fit to every device.
SPEAKER_00: The routes?
SPEAKER_00: Do you agree?
SPEAKER_00: I think they're right.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Well, the technical function, what you said, is just by pressing the button, you should change the state of the TV.
SPEAKER_03: That's just the basic technical function.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That's really my part for this session.
SPEAKER_00: So, is that ease of use or is that more like...
SPEAKER_03: Well, the technical function is pure.
SPEAKER_03: What should the remote control do?
SPEAKER_03: What is his task?
SPEAKER_03: As an device.
SPEAKER_03: It just should change the TVs state.
SPEAKER_03: So, that's it.
SPEAKER_02: But, as far as the buttons, as a means of doing this, or other...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, or the buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Or maybe you want a touchscreen or...
SPEAKER_02: Well, I've seen these remote controls with this little stick, which you can move forward, the side-words.
SPEAKER_02: And it's very easy for you to switch...
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Switch between channels or between tracks on a CD, on chapters, on a DVD player.
SPEAKER_02: So, maybe that's an idea, I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: For other user interface, I had...
SPEAKER_03: Well, it's more industrial, I think.
SPEAKER_03: Pointing at a TV, I think it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to a TV.
SPEAKER_03: So, you must point it everywhere.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe not even pointed.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, just don't even point it.
SPEAKER_03: So, in that case, infrared should maybe be restriction to that.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And it's the restriction for the range, the operating range, too.
SPEAKER_02: So, when you're not able to point at the device...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, if you go to radio...
SPEAKER_03: For TV, you're always in the neighborhood of a TV.
SPEAKER_03: So, I don't think the range should be a problem to that.
SPEAKER_03: If you want to get it working with a radio and you're in outside your garden with just one speaker, then maybe the range should be...
SPEAKER_00: Okay, gentlemen.
SPEAKER_00: Just to remind you, we have five minutes left for this meeting.
SPEAKER_03: Two more things.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: You're able to feel the buttons without...
SPEAKER_03: You have to know what you do without looking at the buttons.
SPEAKER_03: So, it should be...
SPEAKER_03: As user interface, for feeling, it should be good to understand.
SPEAKER_03: So, you can feel the buttons for volume or whatever, I think.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And, of course, you don't always know where all buttons are.
SPEAKER_03: So, it should be visible in dark, too.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Those are two really used interface.
SPEAKER_00: I'll write down glow in the dark.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: That's perfect.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: I just want to hear Ruts' input for this meeting.
SPEAKER_00: Do you have anything already...
SPEAKER_00: Idea about how the market will respond to such a product, or what we should take in account when developing such a product?
SPEAKER_01: I think most things have already been said, like control multiple devices.
SPEAKER_01: And infrared might be an issue.
SPEAKER_00: Because?
SPEAKER_01: Well, he said about pointing.
SPEAKER_01: But lots of devices already use infrared.
SPEAKER_01: So, we probably have to implement that.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Sebastian, did you have any other ideas?
SPEAKER_02: Well, yes, I had.
SPEAKER_02: About three months ago.
SPEAKER_02: I've seen it, I've forgotten.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yes, I remember.
SPEAKER_02: You said something about visibility in dark.
SPEAKER_02: Would it be nice for a user to have display on this remote control, on which you can see functions, which makes it easier to operate.
SPEAKER_03: Well, maybe I...
SPEAKER_03: It can be quite simple.
SPEAKER_03: You can just have white buttons with a black mark on it.
SPEAKER_03: The digits in black, then it's already visible in dark.
SPEAKER_03: So, it don't have to be lightening or fancy.
SPEAKER_00: Well, it can be for design.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, because we want to develop a trendy product.
SPEAKER_02: So, there's a cost limitation too.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: 12 euro 50.
SPEAKER_02: That's a big problem, I think.
SPEAKER_02: I think the financial part of this project implicates that it's not going to be a high end product.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: The cost price is very low.
SPEAKER_03: Just to mention something.
SPEAKER_03: The digits of the painting on the buttons should not fade.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, very good.
SPEAKER_03: Always have...
SPEAKER_03: The soft buttons always clear the paint on it.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: I have one point which comes in mind now.
SPEAKER_00: I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily, or should not consume too much power.
SPEAKER_00: Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every other week.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So, maybe we could, for example, only light the buttons that are applicable at that moment.
SPEAKER_00: Or, yeah, I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: That's more...
SPEAKER_00: Sebastian's...
SPEAKER_03: But then Bluetooth might be a problem.
SPEAKER_03: Because I think Bluetooth uses a lot of...
SPEAKER_02: Well, that's it.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_02: I have cell phones have integrated Bluetooth also.
SPEAKER_02: Well, it seems to work quite okay.
SPEAKER_03: But you can use Bluetooth all the time, 24 hours a day.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Jenswen, it's over.
SPEAKER_00: I'm afraid we do not have any more time.
SPEAKER_00: So, we will go back to our own work.
SPEAKER_00: Next meeting starts in 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_00: And, well, you know your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about it.
SPEAKER_00: So, this was...
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: See you in 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_03: Great.
