None: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, that's not going to work.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, all right.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: All right.
SPEAKER_03: As you all know, we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote.
SPEAKER_03: I'm Nick Tabusk. I'm the project manager.
SPEAKER_03: We'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing, what your role is.
SPEAKER_03: Go ahead.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. I'm Corinne Whiting and I will be the marketing expert.
SPEAKER_00: And in each of the three phases, I will have a different role in the function design phase.
SPEAKER_00: I will be talking about user requirements specification.
SPEAKER_00: And this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled.
SPEAKER_00: And I'll be doing research to figure this out.
SPEAKER_00: In the conceptual design phase, I will be dealing with trend watching.
SPEAKER_00: And I'll be doing marketing research on the web.
SPEAKER_00: And then finally in the detailed design phase, I will be doing product evaluation.
SPEAKER_00: And so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all of the requirements to see how we did.
SPEAKER_02: I'm Ryan. I'm the user interface designer. Likewise, I have three different roles for each stage of the design.
SPEAKER_02: The functional design is looking at the technical functions of remote control.
SPEAKER_02: In the concept design, the user interface, how the user reacts with the product.
SPEAKER_02: And in the detailed design, sort of like the user interface design, what they're looking for, things like fashions, what makes it special.
SPEAKER_02: That's about it. I'm Manuel.
SPEAKER_01: And I'm the industrial designer in this project.
SPEAKER_01: In the functional design phase, I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements.
SPEAKER_01: We'll discuss what the product has to fulfill and so on.
SPEAKER_01: I suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one.
SPEAKER_01: In the conceptual design, I'll be mostly dealing with properties and materials of our product.
SPEAKER_01: And the detailed design and the detailed design, I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself.
SPEAKER_01: Pretty much working together, obviously, on the design.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. So we've got our opening, our agenda is the opening acquaintance, which we've kind of done.
SPEAKER_03: Tool training, project plan, discussion, and then closing.
SPEAKER_03: Granted, 25 minutes we have here.
SPEAKER_03: So we are putting together a new remote control.
SPEAKER_03: We want it to be something original.
SPEAKER_03: Of course, we're a not only electronics company, but a fashion conscious electronics company.
SPEAKER_03: We've got a brand new app called Trendy.
SPEAKER_03: And we want it to be easy to use.
SPEAKER_03: We've got the functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design.
SPEAKER_03: And well, functional design.
SPEAKER_03: Do we have any ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have?
SPEAKER_03: And then we can go into how we're going to design it and how we're going to do the detailing on it.
SPEAKER_02: Well, function remote control is just a change of channels as it's main function.
SPEAKER_03: So we want it to be a TV remote, or do we want it to do other things besides just be a television remote?
SPEAKER_02: I suppose try to make it a university remote, but it could work on all sort of electrical products in one person's house.
SPEAKER_02: But you know, they also have the same role, changing channels, volumes, and then programming.
SPEAKER_02: I think they all work on the same principles, which I doubt is no.
SPEAKER_03: It's not.
SPEAKER_03: I think, yeah, universal remote.
SPEAKER_03: This is my first go around with creating remote control.
SPEAKER_03: I think we're all on the same boat here.
SPEAKER_02: One thing I thought of remote control is you always lose them.
SPEAKER_02: There's a way of finding that quite easily.
SPEAKER_03: So we should we should feature set our remote control up to where it has a.
SPEAKER_03: Like a tracking device or like a whistle or making noise.
SPEAKER_02: It makes a noise.
SPEAKER_03: There's a button on the TV that you press.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So.
SPEAKER_02: Generally all remote was a sort of quite similar in their pains.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We want so they're kind of like long and rectangular.
SPEAKER_00: We want something crazy.
SPEAKER_03: You know, we want something new that's going to stand out.
SPEAKER_03: I think modern.
SPEAKER_02: So our remote should be very close.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe like user friendly like a little.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: People I thought maybe because people always sent a theory about the place to whether it was in a ball and actual controls or inside or something.
SPEAKER_01: Well, there are of course certain restrictions.
SPEAKER_01: You can't have it be any form and fulfill all functions at the same time.
SPEAKER_01: So there are obviously some restrictions we have to apply here.
SPEAKER_01: However, one question is how stable is that.
SPEAKER_01: Is that thing supposed to be the first of the material pretty much?
SPEAKER_01: What are we going to build the thing out of how sturdy is it going to be?
SPEAKER_01: Do we want it to last longer or rather have people.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so by one.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So we want to be sturdy.
SPEAKER_03: We wanted to hold up to somebody's child, you know, throwing it across the room.
SPEAKER_03: Or as you said, people kind of throw it so ball shaped.
SPEAKER_03: You know, if it were ball shaped, maybe.
SPEAKER_02: Can you cast on the outside and everything can be inside.
SPEAKER_03: Camp.
SPEAKER_03: So we want it to be modern fun.
SPEAKER_03: Sturdy.
SPEAKER_03: So our form and our function.
SPEAKER_03: We wanted to be easy to find.
SPEAKER_03: What else.
SPEAKER_03: What else do we want it to do?
SPEAKER_03: So we want it to be universal.
SPEAKER_03: It's something that we're supposed to sell for about 25 euros.
SPEAKER_03: And.
SPEAKER_03: So we want to make sure that we have the same goals for profits or I think somewhere around 50 million euros.
SPEAKER_03: What they want to make on it.
SPEAKER_00: Also, since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association, maybe we want to make it something that would globally appeal.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: That's more on the research end.
SPEAKER_03: So marketing, you know, how maybe marketing you could find out what is the most universally appealing remote control out there.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And maybe as far as design goes, maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences.
SPEAKER_00: Because maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting.
SPEAKER_02: And.
SPEAKER_03: You guys have any ideas for what it should look like.
SPEAKER_03: We want to be a ball.
SPEAKER_03: Drop the ball and maybe where the buttons are located.
SPEAKER_02: My original idea was just simply sort of a sphere where maybe you.
SPEAKER_02: This is where it's connected together.
SPEAKER_02: And then when you open it out, it could be a flip, like a flip phone.
SPEAKER_02: And then when you fold it out of the middle, maybe a hinge.
SPEAKER_02: That's the strongest part of it.
SPEAKER_02: Without if you did use a hinge, you're just two parts and then you'd have just like you buttons.
SPEAKER_02: Things inside, I think sometimes we're not so too many buttons.
SPEAKER_02: So very simple as possible.
SPEAKER_02: There's few of those inside as possible.
SPEAKER_02: And then there was the idea for just something.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe if it had like some kind of light or something or lights around it.
SPEAKER_02: It's looking a bit like something like Star Wars at the moment.
SPEAKER_02: To be fair.
SPEAKER_02: That was just a simple idea.
SPEAKER_02: I didn't know you could feel out about it.
SPEAKER_02: It would almost be likeable.
SPEAKER_02: So that was just the idea I had.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if there was other ideas.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: One problem you'd get with this design is the ball is an ice idea because of its stability.
SPEAKER_01: But of course, since it's about a roll, we'd have to have it flat on the side of the east.
SPEAKER_01: We'd have to take away that part.
SPEAKER_01: That's one of the big issues.
SPEAKER_01: Also you risk the hinges here.
SPEAKER_02: There is a problem.
SPEAKER_02: There is a hinge.
SPEAKER_01: That's interesting of course, but that's of course a weak point.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: How would we go about making, you know, getting rid of our weak points?
SPEAKER_03: What I mean, but we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball.
SPEAKER_03: Not to put you on the spot, but what did you say your title was again?
SPEAKER_03: I'm the industrial designer.
SPEAKER_01: Industrial designer.
SPEAKER_01: Well, the point is that maybe the shape is perhaps not the most ideal as stable as it is.
SPEAKER_01: There must be a compromise between the stability design here.
SPEAKER_02: I'm sure I think of the design of others.
SPEAKER_02: I can't think of anything other than the long rectangle.
SPEAKER_02: For a small sort of faster ones, but there's nothing being done sort of out of.
SPEAKER_03: That's not new. It's not innovative.
SPEAKER_03: Everybody does longer remote because it's easy.
SPEAKER_03: It's stable.
SPEAKER_00: I'll do something.
SPEAKER_03: Go ahead.
SPEAKER_00: My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape, you know, like video games.
SPEAKER_00: So maybe, I mean, that would be kind of big and bulky.
SPEAKER_00: We could also try to do the hints then so it could like flip out that way.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: I think definitely doing something different.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, very design something that's sort of like, I suppose not always everybody's hands the same, but something that would be fitting the hand easier.
SPEAKER_02: Something with a grip.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Because even I suppose even with the ball, you still might be able to.
SPEAKER_03: It might not be the easiest to hold on to.
SPEAKER_03: So perhaps the joystick, the keyboard idea might work better.
SPEAKER_03: But then again, people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda.
SPEAKER_02: So maybe maybe it's the thing is definitely going to be a one on the job.
SPEAKER_03: I feel like I'm just shooting everything down here.
SPEAKER_00: You're the boss.
SPEAKER_01: The one hand to design yourself in front of the size, because you know, from cell phones, they can be too small.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's too small.
SPEAKER_01: If it's small, it probably looks better, but it may not be as functional.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so fortunately we've got about five minutes here to come up with our remote control idea and start rolling with it.
SPEAKER_03: We've talked about our experiences with remote control and we've got a couple ideas.
SPEAKER_03: Let's see here.
SPEAKER_03: What if we had not only, say we went with the ball, the ball function.
SPEAKER_03: But maybe we give it sort of grips along the side to make it easier to hold on to.
SPEAKER_03: So, you know, so it's easier to hold on to that way.
SPEAKER_03: Of course, that'll then remove some of our ball unless this, unless this part were raised.
SPEAKER_03: So say the cover flips over and covers that part.
SPEAKER_03: So the grip is no, that wouldn't work either.
SPEAKER_03: If we're going to make it flat on the bottom, then that eliminates our ball anyways.
SPEAKER_03: So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sort of grips on the side here, I guess.
SPEAKER_03: And then we have the problem with the hinge.
SPEAKER_03: So if we're flat on the bottom, it's not going to roll away. It'll stay where we want.
SPEAKER_01: The question is also, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it?
SPEAKER_01: That's true. It's probably going to lie around open all the time anyway.
SPEAKER_01: So I don't know if a lid is a good idea from stability point of view.
SPEAKER_01: It certainly is. But also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things.
SPEAKER_01: Break by accident, the more we sell.
SPEAKER_01: So, don't make it.
SPEAKER_03: So we don't have it flip open. We just have a ball.
SPEAKER_02: But then maybe go about to the thing I want to know those things.
SPEAKER_03: So then we forget the ball.
SPEAKER_03: It looks cool, but it's really not functional.
SPEAKER_03: So we've got our sort of keyboard kind. But if we flipped it around here so that it were.
SPEAKER_03: Sorry, that doesn't look anything like what you had there.
SPEAKER_03: So it's up and down. You hold it this way.
SPEAKER_03: Of course, then it's like the rectangular again only with a couple of jutting out points.
SPEAKER_03: But it's one handed.
SPEAKER_01: Question is what makes those game pads functional?
SPEAKER_01: I think that's pretty much the form for the hand.
SPEAKER_01: So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Mix it nice. So that's the essential part except for that I think.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: We'll not probably not get away from some longer design.
SPEAKER_01: Because you also have to know which way around to point this thing.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Because it doesn't have a cord like joysticks do.
SPEAKER_01: Batteries go weak as well. So after a while you have to point it towards the equipment you want to control with it.
SPEAKER_01: Show which is the front which is the back.
SPEAKER_03: It's impossible to have it to where it would work with like a sensor on either side.
SPEAKER_03: So that either way you're pointing it will work.
SPEAKER_01: Of course, the more technology you stick in that, the more.
SPEAKER_01: More.
SPEAKER_01: More expensive.
SPEAKER_01: So.
SPEAKER_01: Of course, you can do.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, of course, it will be evident after a while.
SPEAKER_01: If you look at it, it will be evident which way around to point it since you have the numbers and the buttons and stuff.
SPEAKER_01: But it's about the instinctual thing.
SPEAKER_01: I can just grab it. You don't have to just look at it, you know, which way around to point it.
SPEAKER_01: Otherwise, the design of the point of putting two sensors on both sides would probably work.
SPEAKER_02: Even if you design it in some way that, you know, isn't a rectangle but still pointed in a direction that had a definite point.
SPEAKER_02: So that's your thing.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I'm like that instead.
SPEAKER_02: And there you can know which way you're in the point today.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Sorry to interrupt, but we have a warning.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, we had a time.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Well.
SPEAKER_03: Just to finish up, should we go with this plan?
SPEAKER_03: Let's start making some...
SPEAKER_03: Our good ideas, what are not?
SPEAKER_02: Let's say, what's he saying?
SPEAKER_02: Because now what we need to do for the next meeting, I think.
SPEAKER_03: So, we're going to finish now.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Project manager will design a better meeting for the next time around.
SPEAKER_03: You're a little bit more prepared.
SPEAKER_03: And, all right.
SPEAKER_03: Good meeting.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
