SPEAKER_00:我就 tell you something..
SPEAKER_01: And then we're just the other one.
SPEAKER_01: Okay everybody ready? I think so.
SPEAKER_01: I think the first thing we do is into two-sour ourselves.
SPEAKER_01: That's a good plan.
SPEAKER_01: And we say, what your function is.
SPEAKER_01: So maybe Mr. K.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, my name is Flaunsenna.
SPEAKER_02: And I'm a user interface.
SPEAKER_02: My role is the main responsibility is user interface.
SPEAKER_02: And my role is to design a television remote control.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. And I'm a marketing person.
SPEAKER_00: I want to figure out how to sell them.
SPEAKER_01: And your name is?
SPEAKER_00: My name is Eileen.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I'm Janvi.
SPEAKER_03: I'm my role as industrial designer.
SPEAKER_03: And my responsibilities are to deal with technical functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design.
SPEAKER_01: Very good. And as you already know, I'm Betsy.
SPEAKER_01: I'm the project manager for today.
SPEAKER_01: So why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, opening, Quentin's tool training.
SPEAKER_01: Well, the tools, I think we already, I guess the tool is really our computer.
SPEAKER_01: As far as I can see, we get each of us, we'll get instructions.
SPEAKER_01: And we'll take it from their project plan that falls under the same heading pretty much.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think we have any great discussion at this point.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: Here is what this thing should be.
SPEAKER_01: This thing we are going to design.
SPEAKER_01: Is there new remote control?
SPEAKER_01: Should be original?
SPEAKER_01: Trendy.
SPEAKER_01: And of course, user friendly.
SPEAKER_01: So maybe you want to make some notes of that.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve.
SPEAKER_01: That is, it's going to be individual work.
SPEAKER_01: And then at the meeting, we'll discuss what we have come up with.
SPEAKER_01: The same goes for the conceptual design.
SPEAKER_01: There will be individual work and then discussion afterwards.
SPEAKER_01: Detail design.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Same thing, basically.
SPEAKER_00: Three different types of design that we're going to be concerned with.
SPEAKER_00: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: Conceptual.
SPEAKER_00: Conceptual.
SPEAKER_00: I can't write this thing.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe we should redesign it.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: After we finish the remote control, we'll get to that.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Then tool training tried the whiteboard.
SPEAKER_01: But it's in control of their favorite animal.
SPEAKER_01: Does anybody want to go and see how the whiteboard works?
SPEAKER_01: So that in case we have to in the next meeting present something on the whiteboard, you want to go high-lean and see what I can do.
SPEAKER_01: Whether you see if I'm...
SPEAKER_00: Without hanging yourself.
SPEAKER_00: See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something.
SPEAKER_01: And remember you have to press so it works.
SPEAKER_01: So but it works.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Well traditional kitty cat.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, that's a fat cat.
SPEAKER_00: I have a very fat cat.
SPEAKER_00: And it likes to sit like that.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And you're fronting, right?
SPEAKER_01: Would you like just to see how it feels so that you have a little idea?
SPEAKER_00: Am I supposed to wipe off that?
SPEAKER_01: No, no, that's okay.
SPEAKER_01: No, okay.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Get to that later.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: What should I do?
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to draw a snake.
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to draw a snake.
SPEAKER_00: I hope the kitty cat is hungry because I don't like snakes.
SPEAKER_01: Here's a project finance.
SPEAKER_01: Which of course we all have to think about when we design this thing.
SPEAKER_01: Selling price is supposed to be 25 euro.
SPEAKER_01: Profit aim for the company is 50 million euro.
SPEAKER_01: The market range unlimited meaning international.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And the production cost should not exceed.
SPEAKER_01: Hopefully should be less than 1250 euro.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, let's keep everybody on their toes and challenged.
SPEAKER_01: So these are all things, of course, to remember is about it.
SPEAKER_01: And when you design to materials cost, et cetera.
SPEAKER_01: Now, the discussion, I guess, is, um, does any of you have experience with remote control?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, of course.
SPEAKER_01: We use them, right, every day.
SPEAKER_01: And, um, now, having used in the remote control for years, does anybody already have, like, an idea?
SPEAKER_01: Like, things you didn't like with it, things you would like to change, things you would like to improve with this thing.
SPEAKER_01: Any first ideas?
SPEAKER_01: Would you like to be smaller, bigger, have more buttons on it, or maybe clearly, better marked buttons, you know, things like that?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I feel that all the remote should be very compact.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: Those which we get here nowadays, it's very long.
SPEAKER_02: And, um, and it should have multipurpose, like, the remote control which we use for TV, it should be used for some other purpose also, like, controlling the temperature inside the house or for air conditioners, or for heating systems.
SPEAKER_01: So it should be a multifunctional gadget that would control all your household machines, basically.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, exactly.
SPEAKER_00: Um, 12, 50 euros per...
SPEAKER_00: Well?
SPEAKER_00: Well, we know, so we get a really good designer, maybe we can do that.
SPEAKER_00: We certainly can try to, I agree with her, that to market something successfully, it should do some more things.
SPEAKER_01: It should be something new, it should do something different than just what we have.
SPEAKER_01: Now, of course, the other thing to think there is maybe the design.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, design should be, it should be different.
SPEAKER_02: Almost all the...
SPEAKER_01: Like, trendy, you know, like, earlier or so, maybe it should be something trendy, you know, maybe different colors or materials.
SPEAKER_01: Or, you know, so, yeah, shapes, right?
SPEAKER_01: You know, like, kidney shaped feels better in your hand or something, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, friendly shape.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: That would help.
SPEAKER_00: I think another thing that would help is, if it beeps when you clap, because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them, they can't find it.
SPEAKER_01: That is true.
SPEAKER_01: They put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or, you know, whatever.
SPEAKER_01: And they, the suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the TV off and say, my remote control, yeah. Well, or, yeah, or if it's really, if it's really in a dark spot, that it keeps out a sound or signal.
SPEAKER_00: So, it's either the flash.
SPEAKER_00: A light should blink.
SPEAKER_01: A flash signal with...
SPEAKER_01: A signal, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Throw signal, you know.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, maybe it should have a light so that we can just recognize where it is.
SPEAKER_01: Exactly. I mean, just, you know, that's what I'm saying.
SPEAKER_01: I'm just saying, throw signal meaning just whether it's a, be, be, whether a light or...
SPEAKER_00: I do think a good clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it respond to your voice or it would respond.
SPEAKER_00: What should you have to do to make it beep or blink?
SPEAKER_01: Okay, my, my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden, in other words, if it's like in a dark spot, meaning, you know, like newspaper is on top, or it's behind a plant.
SPEAKER_01: At that moment, it's like, it's like what you call it, the light sensors, you know.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: In that moment, it has a sensor.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: It gets a certain darkness.
SPEAKER_01: It has a sensor and it gives out a signal.
SPEAKER_01: Whether that be a light signal or a beep, I mean, that we can discuss that later, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And...
SPEAKER_00: So, the light sensor would activate the signal.
SPEAKER_01: That's right.
SPEAKER_01: You know, it would be...
SPEAKER_01: Right, you have to have some kind of sensor.
SPEAKER_01: And I think voice or clapping, that's not specific enough.
SPEAKER_01: I know there are the lamps and stuff, you know, you can clap on and off.
SPEAKER_01: But I think they only work to a certain degree.
SPEAKER_00: But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it.
SPEAKER_01: Of course.
SPEAKER_00: Well, because you're silly, because people are silly.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah, well.
SPEAKER_00: But then those people...
SPEAKER_00: We can't help everybody.
SPEAKER_00: Well, it would be like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table.
SPEAKER_00: You know, we have to move along.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we have to move along.
SPEAKER_01: But I think we have some good points to start with here.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, the next meeting will be in 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_01: I think you all...
SPEAKER_01: Did you get notices on your computer for this?
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so you'll get to notice.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: The working design.
SPEAKER_01: I guess that's the function ID, who is this industrial designer?
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: What's your...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's functional.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, exactly.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so we're looking for a working design when we come back.
SPEAKER_03: Working design, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's a...
SPEAKER_03: And then...
SPEAKER_01: And then the technical function.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the technical function.
SPEAKER_01: So you're the working design.
SPEAKER_01: So you have a working design.
SPEAKER_01: And then a functional design.
SPEAKER_01: And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirements specification, like friendliness and what we just discussed in general.
SPEAKER_01: That would be your idea.
SPEAKER_01: And of course, price.
SPEAKER_01: That it, that the price is a good price.
SPEAKER_01: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, the price is given, but that was...
SPEAKER_00: We have to justify that.
SPEAKER_00: That's right.
SPEAKER_00: By having sufficient features to make it sell at that price.
SPEAKER_01: That's right.
SPEAKER_01: And, you know, you will get specific instructions for that.
SPEAKER_01: I think that's the end of the show.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So we have, well, we have a...
SPEAKER_01: Two, two, three minutes.
SPEAKER_01: Any questions at this point or suggestions?
SPEAKER_01: I think basically, basically, you will get instructions to work with.
SPEAKER_01: And if you have any questions, I guess you can...
SPEAKER_00: I think I have enough to think about our next meeting.
SPEAKER_00: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: How about you people?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you're right.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: All right, well...
SPEAKER_01: Then we see you in about 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_01: And see what we can come up with.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, very good.
SPEAKER_01: Okay?
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, we have to give it here.
None: Awesome.
