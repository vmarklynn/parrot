None: you Does he want to talk to you now?
None: Tsss....
None: That's him!
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Thanks for coming to this meeting.
SPEAKER_04: How are we doing on our remote?
SPEAKER_04: We have some, we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want.
SPEAKER_00: Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I was asked that they were doing it.
SPEAKER_04: Alright, let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting.
SPEAKER_04: See if I can't get things moving along here a little bit better.
SPEAKER_04: I'll go over what we went over last time, which shouldn't take long.
SPEAKER_04: Then I believe each of you have a presentation.
SPEAKER_04: It was sent a couple more requirements for our remote, what they want.
SPEAKER_04: Then we can come to a conclusion on what we want the remote to do, and how it's going to do it hopefully.
SPEAKER_04: And then we'll have the closing, which we'll have 40 minutes for.
SPEAKER_04: Let's see, the last meeting, we went over who was responsible for what.
SPEAKER_04: I'm responsible for leading the meetings, keeping the notes, and coming up with the final presentation.
SPEAKER_04: Crane is our marketing expert.
SPEAKER_04: She's going to figure out what the consumer wants.
SPEAKER_04: Crane is our user interface designer, and Manuel is the industrial designer.
SPEAKER_04: So you're going to come up with the ideas, Ryan, and you're going to pick them apart.
SPEAKER_04: We decided our remote, we wanted to be a universal remote that everyone would want.
SPEAKER_04: We wanted to be modern, fun, different, it needs to be sturdy, easy to find.
SPEAKER_04: So we're going to have that locator function.
SPEAKER_04: And we want to be different.
SPEAKER_04: And then we went over a couple of different ideas, ball-shaped phone, the keyboard shape.
SPEAKER_04: We decided that it should probably be one-handed, something we could use with one hand.
SPEAKER_04: And that was our last meeting.
SPEAKER_04: So why don't do each of you have a presentation?
SPEAKER_04: Okay, I'll hand it off to you.
SPEAKER_04: Does anyone want to go first?
SPEAKER_04: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: So we can maybe see what the people want.
SPEAKER_01: What was it function?
SPEAKER_03: Eight.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: How do I got it?
SPEAKER_04: Slime show.
SPEAKER_04: To go to the next one.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Well, this is my report, which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that I was sent.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure if I can do it.
SPEAKER_00: I'm just pressing the arrow, okay.
SPEAKER_01: Sorry, I actually need to see something else on my screen.
SPEAKER_01: Hit F8 again.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think.
SPEAKER_01: And then again.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: You want it to be on both screens or just something else on the screen?
SPEAKER_01: Is that possible?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but I think you have to hit escape.
SPEAKER_04: And then you can.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, but now you don't have that.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, hit F8 again.
SPEAKER_04: Sorry guys.
SPEAKER_04: I know I didn't send it.
SPEAKER_04: And then it should come up.
SPEAKER_04: You're shortly.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So is there no way I can give you the slideshow?
SPEAKER_01: I think.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, give us a slideshow and something on your screen.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Well, I'm not sure you can maybe minimize that screen and then.
SPEAKER_04: Have them both up at the same time.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So first of all, the method that I used was by doing some marketing research by doing research on some interviews that were conducted.
SPEAKER_01: And then some internet research.
SPEAKER_01: And I was sent a report that was.
SPEAKER_01: I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed.
SPEAKER_01: And so I will show you some of the results from that, which I think will be helpful.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, here are some of the findings.
SPEAKER_01: They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls.
SPEAKER_01: And 75% of the users find their remote controls to be ugly, which is a fairly significant number, I would say.
SPEAKER_01: And 80% of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy.
SPEAKER_01: So I think that earlier we were on to something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look.
SPEAKER_01: I think that's definitely important.
SPEAKER_01: And they say the current remote controls do not match well the operating behavior of the user.
SPEAKER_01: 75% of the users said they zap a lot.
SPEAKER_01: And if anyone could clarify what that means.
SPEAKER_01: Zap. Does that just mean like seeing the channel?
SPEAKER_01: Just using it.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And 50% of the users say that they're only using 10% of the buttons on their remote control.
SPEAKER_01: There was something else. They kept track of the frequency per hour and using certain buttons.
SPEAKER_01: And some of them, it looks like barely needs to be included at all.
SPEAKER_01: Of course, channel selection is used the most frequently.
SPEAKER_01: And then teletext was the next volume and then power.
SPEAKER_01: And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used.
SPEAKER_01: So I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button.
SPEAKER_01: The biggest user frustrations, as we said, 50% of people find that their remote are lost somewhere.
SPEAKER_01: And so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea.
SPEAKER_01: They said it takes 34% said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote.
SPEAKER_01: And 26% said that the controls are bad for RSI.
SPEAKER_00: A competitive strategy.
SPEAKER_00: What is it?
SPEAKER_00: Just a competitive strategy.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's what I guess.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And so base.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: As far as speech recognition goes, the younger group looks like they're all for it.
SPEAKER_01: From the 15 to 25 age group, over 90% said they would pay more.
SPEAKER_01: And it kind of just went down incrementally.
SPEAKER_01: The groups at the older they get, it looks like the less willing they are to pay.
SPEAKER_01: So maybe we could discuss this and think.
SPEAKER_01: Decide if we think it's worth investing in this.
SPEAKER_01: At least if we're targeting the younger groups.
SPEAKER_01: And so in conclusion, some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct.
SPEAKER_01: We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of the remote control.
SPEAKER_01: A multi functional remote could be a good thing to explore.
SPEAKER_01: So you only have one rather than five different remote sitting all over your room.
SPEAKER_01: We need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose.
SPEAKER_01: And then lastly, I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition.
SPEAKER_01: And that's it.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Very nice.
SPEAKER_04: Now we actually have some ideas of what what people want, what we should focus on.
SPEAKER_04: Sorry.
SPEAKER_04: Did you guys get time to write everything that you needed?
SPEAKER_01: Having just listened to what Cohen's just saying, I'll draw on some of the things as well.
SPEAKER_00: There's some things that sort of relevant to what I want to say.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So I'm just going to, yeah, approach your technical functions design.
SPEAKER_00: The method I use was to explore the technical functions of remote control.
SPEAKER_00: And simply approach that I came to it is to change program and operate an electronic device remotely.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, that's an obvious thing to say, but it's not attached to the device that you want to control.
SPEAKER_00: I had some things sent to me not very much to look at similar devices, to find and film them, and then personal preferences that I would suggest.
SPEAKER_00: We discussed a universal one.
SPEAKER_00: It's just been brought up again then.
SPEAKER_00: But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design and possibly within maybe the budget that we do it.
SPEAKER_00: Because you need to know all the specifications of all the electronic companies.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure if you've ever come across a universal remote control yourself, but you have to, there are nightmares to you, you have to set them, reset them to everything.
SPEAKER_00: And that would only add buttons, whereas I think there needs to take away buttons.
SPEAKER_00: So I think it would better maybe concentrate on maybe it's a universal one for TVs, or maybe just one that you could design and then different people, manufacturers could use it to set their specifications if the aim is to get something that you need can design.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, here's just two pictures of remote controls, it's just simple TV remote controls.
SPEAKER_00: But one is user-centered, that is the one on the left.
SPEAKER_00: You need to straight away see there's less buttons, and the other one is some engineered-centered, where that's more specified fully, sort of the elaborate piece of equipment that's trying to control.
SPEAKER_00: And that's which appeals more to the product that we want, and on what defines, as I've said, in the market research and stuff, we're probably looking at something that should be user-centered, fewer buttons, simpler to use.
SPEAKER_00: And if 10% is hidden away, if 10% is what's used, maybe the other 50%, the buttons that are used very early, like programming, they could be hidden, maybe, on some remote controls, you might have come across, and maybe a little flip thing, hidden away, and the main buttons that are on the one you come across.
SPEAKER_00: And finally, sorry, I'll cover that up, I think, should be used interface-oriented.
SPEAKER_00: Like I said, to concentrate on TV remote control, the universal remote might be too complex.
SPEAKER_00: And as what the major findings and market research has just said, is to image the appearance that people dislike, so that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend, and then change the fashion of remote controls.
SPEAKER_00: And that's it.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, over there.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_04: What was your last conclusion on that one?
SPEAKER_04: Focus on the image of it.
SPEAKER_00: The actual design.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, good, good.
None: Okay.
None: I'll talk to you about the working design.
None: The interior is basically, which is what, dictates the design, both the interface, basically, and the outer appearance, because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there.
SPEAKER_03: So unfortunately, the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me, obviously, were too drunk to actually accomplish it.
SPEAKER_03: So I'm going to do lots of the stuff on the board.
SPEAKER_03: This is the basic premise of a remote control.
SPEAKER_03: The basic function is to send messages to another system.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so much is clear.
SPEAKER_03: And energy source feeds an integrated circuit, a chip, that can compose messages.
SPEAKER_03: Often in the form of infrared bits, this is the most mostly used.
SPEAKER_03: There's also some sound systems, but infrared is the better, the more used system parts are cheaper as well.
SPEAKER_03: This controls the chip, and accordingly, the messages.
SPEAKER_03: This is where my people screwed up, basically.
SPEAKER_03: So I'm going to explain that on the board, other.
SPEAKER_03: What we have is different components that obviously need to go in there, with start with an energy source.
SPEAKER_03: Usually a battery, since it's not feasible to add a cable to that.
SPEAKER_03: This energy source, of course, is connected to the user interface itself, which can be buttons, whatever, which in fact, controls a chip.
SPEAKER_03: This is the user interface, and there we have the chip.
SPEAKER_03: The way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp that sends out the signal.
SPEAKER_03: Of course, the signal differs accordingly, depending on what the chip tells the infrared lamp.
SPEAKER_03: Of course, that's controlled.
SPEAKER_03: The chip itself is controlled by the user interface.
SPEAKER_03: The way you normally do it is that you add a little device, such as a lamp, to the whole thing as well, so that you know that it's working.
SPEAKER_03: Basically, you press something, you get a response, which is also comparatively important on one of those devices.
SPEAKER_03: Now, what we're talking about here, or what I think should be discussed, are these two components, mostly the energy source for one thing, can be altered, but we probably cannot alter, is, of course, the infrared, the sending device, basically, the infrared lamp.
SPEAKER_03: We cannot change the chip, which controls the infrared lamp.
SPEAKER_03: These two components that we have to use, and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing, the lamp can be put onto the device.
SPEAKER_03: It doesn't have to be there.
SPEAKER_03: This can be discussed as well.
SPEAKER_03: We use the interface. That's something we can also discuss.
SPEAKER_03: As we've heard, speech recognition is the hype, obviously, in the moment.
SPEAKER_03: Speech recognition interface.
SPEAKER_03: We don't know that, or if we just do the usual button thing, or we have a touchpad, or something like that, that's something we can discuss.
SPEAKER_03: And, of course, the energy source, batteries, solar cells, who knows.
SPEAKER_03: Of course, it's always a question whether these components are, in fact, available cheap enough, developed enough.
SPEAKER_03: But that's, I suppose, rather, up to marketing, not you.
SPEAKER_03: So we can, to the industry of design.
SPEAKER_04: The more complex we make, and, of course, the more expensive it's going to be.
SPEAKER_04: But people have said that they would, well, younger generations of people said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote.
SPEAKER_04: So, possibly, it might be worth the investment.
SPEAKER_00: I think speech recognition was one of those things where, it has to be really good for them to work.
SPEAKER_00: Sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and over, and you'll be something you've found.
SPEAKER_04: I agree.
SPEAKER_00: So, taking some languages, and then different dialects, I suppose.
SPEAKER_04: Myself, I find when you, when there's something that speaks, speech recognition, like you call on the phone, and you try to change your telephone or power or something.
SPEAKER_04: Sometimes they have a speech recognition on the other end, and you say one for this, and you find yourself, like you said, saying the same thing over and over and over.
SPEAKER_04: I find myself, especially if I'm in a crowd of people looking really silly.
SPEAKER_04: So, maybe if you're sitting on your couch with a bunch of people, then...
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if, would you want to keep saying stuff?
SPEAKER_00: If you're watching something, would you sort of...
SPEAKER_04: Volume up, volume down, change the channel, you know, channel up, channel down.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Another thing about these figures is 91% of the youngest age groups said they'd do it, but probably a lot of them, that's actually there's parents money.
SPEAKER_01: Like, I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this, themselves, a 15-year-old, you know?
SPEAKER_00: As well, the gimmick factor.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: It's a gimmick factor that they like at first, and...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, well.
SPEAKER_00:...get old here.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Let's see here.
SPEAKER_00: Cold money.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I guess so.
SPEAKER_04: Tried jack.
SPEAKER_04: Now, I was sent a couple of things to modify our...
SPEAKER_04:...new requirements.
SPEAKER_04: The remote's only going to be for the television, which is good because we already decided...
SPEAKER_04:...your research showed that not only is the universal remote more complicated, it's more costly, and your research showed that, you know, most of the people don't even use it.
SPEAKER_04: I think you said 50% of the people only use half the...
SPEAKER_04:...or 10% of the buttons.
SPEAKER_04: So, if we remove the universal remote, then that solves that problem.
SPEAKER_04: No teletext.
SPEAKER_04: So, we don't have to worry about that.
SPEAKER_04: But we do have to use the company wants us to incorporate the corporate color and our slogan, which is, we put the fashion in electronics.
SPEAKER_04: And our corporate colors are gray and yellow.
SPEAKER_04: And we could probably get away with black too, but...
SPEAKER_04: So, those are the three...
SPEAKER_04:...the three new requirements that I was told we need to use.
SPEAKER_04: From all three of your presentations, I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting.
SPEAKER_04: We want something that looks good.
SPEAKER_04: We want something that's simple.
SPEAKER_04: We want something that you can find easily.
SPEAKER_04: And the speech recognition, I guess, is kind of a give or take.
SPEAKER_04: It's going to cost more.
SPEAKER_04: The younger people say that they like it, but...
SPEAKER_04: It's probably, I would say probably not worth the investment at this point in time.
SPEAKER_04: So, maybe we should just do away with speech recognition.
SPEAKER_04: And that way we can focus on our form.
SPEAKER_00: I did have a thought about the...
SPEAKER_00:...so the tracking thing.
SPEAKER_00: It came with maybe a holder.
SPEAKER_00: Or a holster, whatever you want to call it.
SPEAKER_00: You should put it back in.
SPEAKER_00: If you don't put it back in, you press something like a little bit more on that.
SPEAKER_00: It just sends out a beat to find where it is, isn't it?
SPEAKER_00: I didn't forget to mention me too, complex.
SPEAKER_04: That would be good if we were going with our ball.
SPEAKER_04: Or with any form that would be good.
SPEAKER_04: That could be the charger for...
SPEAKER_04: We could use rechargeable batteries in the remote.
SPEAKER_04: And that would be solar.
SPEAKER_04: However you wanted to go about it, the holder could also be the charging unit.
SPEAKER_04: With the locator button.
SPEAKER_04: And if it were the ball, you'd no longer have to have a flat space on it.
SPEAKER_04: And if we still have this, you just hold on to it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you put it on the couch table while you're watching.
SPEAKER_03: So that's not what I was thinking.
SPEAKER_04: So after the meeting, we'll have some questionnaires.
SPEAKER_04: And some summaries for what's going on.
SPEAKER_04: Then we'll take lunch.
SPEAKER_04: We can come back and work on our individual work.
SPEAKER_04: I'll do the minutes.
SPEAKER_04: Let's see.
SPEAKER_04: It looks like you're already on your way for working with the components.
SPEAKER_04: Chips.
SPEAKER_04: What chips we need and what...
SPEAKER_04: How to power it and whatnot.
SPEAKER_04: We want to use our interface concept.
SPEAKER_04: We want it to be something simple.
SPEAKER_04: Minimal number of buttons.
SPEAKER_04: I guess our main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Did you have time earlier to work on that?
SPEAKER_04: Did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done?
SPEAKER_00: I'll try to look at the actual opinions in my next break.
SPEAKER_00: I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately 100 balls.
SPEAKER_00: Probably not going to do anything.
SPEAKER_00: Something like that might be difficult.
SPEAKER_00: I think it still has a bit of variation.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe.
SPEAKER_00: I know that's angry, but maybe not.
SPEAKER_00: Boy, there's players around.
SPEAKER_04: Should we maybe shoot for a specific target group?
SPEAKER_04: That way we could...
SPEAKER_04: If we are shooting for young guys, then it's a certain look to the remote or girls or older people.
SPEAKER_04: Do you think that would help us find a specific form that we would want to pick out?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if that might come up.
SPEAKER_00: I might be trying to watch you.
SPEAKER_00: Do you find anything for all of that?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, not yet, but maybe by the next meeting we'll have something to learn.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So we know that the remote is going to have to be...
SPEAKER_04: Let's just say we've got a color scheme for it.
SPEAKER_04: Yellow and yellow.
SPEAKER_04: It's nice and bright with the buttons being gray or black and our slogan pasted somewhere on it on the bottom.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe we could sketch.
SPEAKER_04: So basically, all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe we could flare it or something, you know?
SPEAKER_04: So it's more...
SPEAKER_04: Of course, this will look like a bone then.
SPEAKER_04: Let's go ahead and erase this.
SPEAKER_04: Hope everyone memorized that.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, it might be to look at the shape and trend of things like mobile phones and shapes that they've been going...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, they've gone from big brick block things which still don't move on.
SPEAKER_00: It's always sort of slinky, small things.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, everybody's got a mobile phone.
SPEAKER_04: Right?
SPEAKER_04: Except for me now.
SPEAKER_04: But they are all mobile phones.
SPEAKER_04: They've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small.
SPEAKER_04: Which made to feed our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time.
SPEAKER_04: But then again, you don't want the first mobile phone that was this big and you had a handbag to carry it around in.
SPEAKER_04: So we've got basically what the remotes look like now is kind of what we're...
SPEAKER_04: What we're stuck with.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe we could go with a square or something.
SPEAKER_04: You know, with minimal number of buttons.
SPEAKER_04: I guess you've got, you know, one through nine.
SPEAKER_04: You're typing in your channels.
SPEAKER_04: You've got volume up and down.
SPEAKER_04: Channel up and down.
SPEAKER_01: Power.
SPEAKER_04: Power.
SPEAKER_04: Usually at the top.
SPEAKER_04: A mute.
SPEAKER_04: That's the classic design.
SPEAKER_04: That's pretty much all you need, I think.
SPEAKER_04: A menu button.
SPEAKER_04: If you want the remote to do other things like...
SPEAKER_04: Or I guess the TV to be able to change the tint and the color and all those kind of things that are built into TVs.
SPEAKER_04: We just have that under one standard menu button where you go in.
SPEAKER_04: Press the menu button.
SPEAKER_04: Scroll up and down to select it.
SPEAKER_03: So we're looking at which maybe scrolling function is not too bad.
SPEAKER_03: Talk about maybe...
SPEAKER_03: Look at that from the side.
SPEAKER_03: Which is technically the easiest option.
SPEAKER_03: It would probably be scrolling wheel like this.
SPEAKER_04: Like a wheel on your mouse.
SPEAKER_03: So you can even...
SPEAKER_03: If we're coming from mice, we can add a click function where you verify the information you just press it down.
SPEAKER_03: It's a good idea.
SPEAKER_03: Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing, if you want to make it square for the looks of it.
SPEAKER_03: Then maybe...
SPEAKER_03: Make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing.
SPEAKER_03: And then you can just bulge down here.
SPEAKER_03: Which maybe from an engineering point, this could be holding the batteries and so on.
SPEAKER_02: I know.
SPEAKER_03: You know what I'm getting at here.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, from the side.
SPEAKER_03: You like that.
SPEAKER_03: Then you hold it in your hand like this.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the...
SPEAKER_03: The side.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe the buttons could decrease the bigger ones.
SPEAKER_00: You know, that has to be bigger in size and the ones that are less important.
SPEAKER_03: You can also have maybe talking about mobile phones again, lighting open.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: With the lesser used functions, the bit less hard and then slides into that part.
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Just pinch the catch. Just simply like on a side view.
SPEAKER_00: Something that you know would sort of fit in the hand better.
SPEAKER_00: So you need to sort of have your hand.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, it's just thinking this...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: This of course causes...
SPEAKER_03: Causes a problem for left or right-handed people.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so such a film.
SPEAKER_00: That, yeah, instantly.
SPEAKER_00: So I'm always going for the right-handed person.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's the old...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, is everyone...
SPEAKER_04: Who in here is right-handed left-handed?
SPEAKER_04: You guys already have this.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, so I'm left-handed.
SPEAKER_04: So I can say that most things are designed for right-handed people.
SPEAKER_04: That's right.
SPEAKER_04: Like the written language.
SPEAKER_04: Or English.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe.
SPEAKER_04: Special order.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, it should be probably designed for right-handed people.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: But that's good.
SPEAKER_04: I think we've got kind of a good plan there.
SPEAKER_04: At least for what buttons we're going to use.
SPEAKER_04: So we've got...
SPEAKER_04: I like the scroll, the scroll action, and the...
SPEAKER_00: I mean, I'm just thinking maybe...
SPEAKER_00: If it was circular.
SPEAKER_00: With this sort of...
SPEAKER_00: That sort of earlier idea we had, with a way that was more like that.
SPEAKER_00: Whereas this is just a one-handed thing that you sort of almost...
SPEAKER_00: We're at a round of thumb.
SPEAKER_00: So you'd have your hand into the other thumb there.
SPEAKER_00: You'd have all the buttons sort of round here.
SPEAKER_00: And that, I think, could work.
SPEAKER_00: On any hand, kind of like holding it.
SPEAKER_00: If you just had it like right around there, left or right.
SPEAKER_03: Minimizes it size-wise.
SPEAKER_00: Minimizes it size.
SPEAKER_00: And then you'd have to...
SPEAKER_03: You know, very quite small.
None: Then there's maybe...
SPEAKER_03: Another point of making it.
SPEAKER_03: The two-in-one kind of thing.
SPEAKER_03: If we have a smaller...
SPEAKER_03: A smaller device that actually fits into the big one.
SPEAKER_03: You have full functions in here.
SPEAKER_03: And just a couple of functions in there.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Like your...
SPEAKER_03: Zep.
SPEAKER_03: Minimizes just channels up down volume.
SPEAKER_03: And on off.
SPEAKER_03: That's it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So two remotes in one.
SPEAKER_04: But then would be easier to lose...
SPEAKER_04: One for the other.
SPEAKER_03: That's right.
SPEAKER_03: The big one has to be sufficiently big.
SPEAKER_03: And perhaps heavy, so you can't move it around.
