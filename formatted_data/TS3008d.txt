SPEAKER_00: Dat is een signal.
SPEAKER_00: En als je geen sepere en een andere button hebt, met in 5 seconden, dan de remote control is een signal voor Channel 1.
SPEAKER_00: Nou, ik denk dat het werkt.

SPEAKER_00: Het is een remote control dat een andere signal is.
SPEAKER_00: Dat kan niet bevinden, maar ik denk dat het ultiefies in een soort way supporten is.
SPEAKER_00: Ik weet niet.
SPEAKER_00: Nee, ik denk dat het een beetje...
SPEAKER_00: We zijn niet ook niet aan het verantwoord.
SPEAKER_00: Ik denk dat het een beetje werkt, maar ik denk dat het een meer te zijn.
SPEAKER_03: Een remote control dat een signal in een button is.
SPEAKER_00: Ik denk dat het een soort...
SPEAKER_03: Een soort televisie, als je het wilt gaan, dan 10.
SPEAKER_00: De 1-werkt.
SPEAKER_00: Nee, je moet een speciale...
SPEAKER_03: Je moet een tv of meer signal.
SPEAKER_03: Als je een button pressen, je wil een signal.
SPEAKER_03: En de hele televisie moet meer signalen naar het hele hele tijd.
SPEAKER_03: Maar...
SPEAKER_03: Ja, oké, we gaan het.
SPEAKER_03: Als je een technologie dat het wilt geeft meer signals, het goed werkt.
SPEAKER_03: Het is een basic idea van de meest...
SPEAKER_03: De meest common en simpel operatie op de remote.
SPEAKER_02: Ik kan hem in de docking station.
SPEAKER_01: Ja?
SPEAKER_01: Ja.
SPEAKER_03: Het is hier.
SPEAKER_03: En...
SPEAKER_01: Ja, er is geen...
SPEAKER_01: Ik denk dat het een basic is.
SPEAKER_01: Ja, het is geen 1 button.
SPEAKER_01: Dat is een function.
SPEAKER_01: Maar misschien kan we een 1-werkt.
SPEAKER_03: Maar misschien kan we een docking station een beetje standen.
SPEAKER_03: Voor de andere producten we zetten.

SPEAKER_02: Maar als je hetzelfde van dezelfde producten hebt, dan...
SPEAKER_03: We kunnen hetzelfde hetzelfde van dezelfde producten.
SPEAKER_03: Ja, dat is het goed, maar...
SPEAKER_03: Als de rechalder een beetje speelt, we kunnen hetzelfde op hetzelfde.
SPEAKER_03: Ja, maar...
SPEAKER_02: Het moet bevinden om de bevinden te zijn.
SPEAKER_02: Het is niet zo'n geval.
SPEAKER_02: Dat is een beetje...
SPEAKER_03: Ik weet niet of je het niet kan maken, maar dan is het niet zo.
SPEAKER_02: Maar als je hetzelfde van dezelfde producten hebt, dan...
SPEAKER_02: maar dat is het de collectie aan het verbrel om dat ik dan wel conclude kijk...

SPEAKER_02: Maar je kunt een beetje een hoog in het.
SPEAKER_03: In de lille, een lille, een lille productie, die in het.
SPEAKER_00: Dat is passant.
SPEAKER_00: Let's talk about the docking station later, want we have to consider the docking station anyway, want we have some cost issues still to come.
SPEAKER_00: We have to look.
SPEAKER_03: The look and feel would be great on this remote control.
SPEAKER_03: We pick up the remote control in the smallest area, then your left term of your right term is near the program button, which is the most common used function.
SPEAKER_03: All the other buttons are available for your term.
SPEAKER_03: So it's a really good design.
SPEAKER_03: Is it?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, on the side, there will be a strip of rubber.
SPEAKER_03: In the middle, there is a hard material, a hard plastic with a light behind it.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And other lights?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, we can make it also in the own lights on it.
SPEAKER_02: Or the buttons that can make lights on it.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe the logo?
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: But it will also use batteries and we want you.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: For now, this is good enough.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, what was on the, you know,
SPEAKER_03: all the aspects of the interface buttons were...
SPEAKER_00: Okay, but oh yeah, the color, because we're going to use one color for the plastic, and one color for the rubber.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: And we're going to do the buttons, or we're going to have rubber buttons.
SPEAKER_00: And there will be, don't be in the same color as the rubber on the side.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think that would be good.
SPEAKER_00: I think we should use a darker color for the plastic and maybe some more brighter and flashier.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, maybe we can use on the light on the side.
SPEAKER_03: We can use multiple lights.
SPEAKER_03: So it will...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we'll talk about the lights later.
SPEAKER_00: Because it also depends on the costs and such.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And we have to grill upon the exact colors, but I don't know if that's important, but we'll talk about it later.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, for now, this is okay.
SPEAKER_00: This is okay.
SPEAKER_00: The next...
SPEAKER_00: You're going to give a presentation too, or I have to see the...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I'm going to do something right there.
SPEAKER_00: Detailed design.
SPEAKER_02: We've got to do that on the right...
SPEAKER_02: the most...
SPEAKER_02: the right mouse screen, because...
SPEAKER_00: Evaluation criteria.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's me.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, all right.
SPEAKER_02: I will be needing that image.
SPEAKER_02: So, leave it please.
SPEAKER_02: Go away.
SPEAKER_02: Right, we're going to evaluate that design according to a few points.
SPEAKER_02: The four of us are going to do that together.
SPEAKER_02: I want to have a color over here.
SPEAKER_02: Come on.
SPEAKER_02: Right, the remote...
SPEAKER_02: It's not ugly, a bit weird sentence, but the positive thing has to be on the left, so I said not ugly instead of ugly.
SPEAKER_02: What would you say?
SPEAKER_02: We've got to give points to all of these...
SPEAKER_02: to evaluate that design, and please forget the drawing skills of these guys.
SPEAKER_02: The remote controls are not ugly.
SPEAKER_02: How do you feel?
SPEAKER_00: I think four maybe would be appropriate, because it's...
SPEAKER_00: maybe it really depends on taste.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's kind of dairy-our-design.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: So, maybe a lot of people find it really ugly, and other people find it really cool.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know, or...
SPEAKER_00: How do you think?
SPEAKER_03: I think the front...
SPEAKER_03: The front will give it a more...
SPEAKER_03: less, uglier side, because you can make it in your own...
SPEAKER_03: The difference in your own...
SPEAKER_03: Yes, you can make it in your own...
SPEAKER_03: More to your own personality or house style.
SPEAKER_00: We didn't...
SPEAKER_00: We were not planning to use fronts.
SPEAKER_00: No, not fronts, but different designs.
SPEAKER_02: And that's still...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's a little personal touch, I guess.
SPEAKER_00: No, maybe we should do three or something in our...
SPEAKER_02: What would you like to say?
SPEAKER_02: Personally.
SPEAKER_02: Personally.
SPEAKER_01: We can make it a one.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, but what is it?
SPEAKER_03: I think two or three...
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_02: You don't?
SPEAKER_01: I agree.
SPEAKER_01: Two or three?
SPEAKER_01: I go for the positive, so I go for two.
SPEAKER_02: I was thinking about three.
SPEAKER_00: I was thinking about four, so I think three is...
SPEAKER_02: Three is a bit...
SPEAKER_02: How?
SPEAKER_02: What am I doing?
SPEAKER_02: I'll mark it.
SPEAKER_02: Remote controls...
SPEAKER_02: And then makes a stepping easy.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Well, let's make it a one.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, one.
SPEAKER_01: One, thank you, agree?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I agree.
SPEAKER_01: This one, I think, for sure.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not using the ability, so...
SPEAKER_02: I totally agree.
SPEAKER_02: Remote controls...
SPEAKER_02: The remote controls, relevant buttons, are prominently visible.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Two or one, I guess.
SPEAKER_00: It's something we really put work into.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I would say one because...
SPEAKER_02: It's all about buttons.
SPEAKER_02: Every button is relevant.
SPEAKER_02: And they're all...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: That's a one.
SPEAKER_02: You agree?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons.
SPEAKER_02: I think we totally succeeded there.
SPEAKER_00: Well, maybe a two because of the menu...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, maybe not.
SPEAKER_03: Also the buttons of the one, the two, the digits...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we don't know if they're there.
SPEAKER_00: They're used...
SPEAKER_00: It's got a point.
SPEAKER_00: I think it too.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, true.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, it's three.
SPEAKER_00: It came a long way, but not we didn't.
SPEAKER_00: Two.
SPEAKER_03: But you can't make a remote control without them.
SPEAKER_02: No, that's true.
SPEAKER_02: That's true.
SPEAKER_02: They're definitely needed.
SPEAKER_00: It can also always be more simplistic.
SPEAKER_00: We put it on a tool.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: The remote control has got a really trendy look.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: One.
SPEAKER_03: Martin.
SPEAKER_00: Well.
SPEAKER_00: I think two.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It's hard to say from this picture.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We've tried to make it the best trend you've ever.
SPEAKER_02: Ever.
SPEAKER_02: He know.
SPEAKER_00: But I do think it's more...
SPEAKER_01: I'll make it a three because...
SPEAKER_00: I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I agree.
SPEAKER_02: So I think maybe it has to score higher on this than on the...
SPEAKER_02: I was planning to give it a two where I give the not ugly...
SPEAKER_02: The three.
SPEAKER_02: Oh.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That's true.
SPEAKER_02: You agree or not, too?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: When you compare to that.
SPEAKER_02: Great.
SPEAKER_02: Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unlimited buttons.
SPEAKER_00: It's a different thing.
SPEAKER_02: I can't be that one.
SPEAKER_02: Well, forget that.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Go away.
SPEAKER_02: Remote control has got innovative technology implanted.
SPEAKER_02: No, no.
SPEAKER_01: Where you not.
SPEAKER_01: Well, maybe the LCD.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but we're...
SPEAKER_00: You don't mean the rubber stuff.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and the light.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but the light.
SPEAKER_00: That's not innovative.
SPEAKER_00: And I don't know if there's also re-not innovative.
SPEAKER_02: Light is not...
SPEAKER_02: It's not.
SPEAKER_00: Seven?
SPEAKER_00: No, six.
SPEAKER_00: Well, seven maybe.
SPEAKER_00: No, six.
SPEAKER_02: Why not seven?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Why not seven?
SPEAKER_03: Because we've tried to make it a little bit innovative.
SPEAKER_03: But how?
SPEAKER_00: It depends on the...
SPEAKER_03: With the light, it's kind of future...
SPEAKER_00: No, I think it's actually seven maybe.
SPEAKER_00: But there's nothing innovative about it.
SPEAKER_02: It's true.
SPEAKER_02: I agree.
SPEAKER_03: But still, you can retrieve it when it's gone.
SPEAKER_03: With...
SPEAKER_02: With generally or...
SPEAKER_02: You didn't draw the original form.
SPEAKER_02: No, the doggy station is...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean the doggy station.
SPEAKER_00: But I think...
SPEAKER_00: It's a part of the remote doggy station.
SPEAKER_00: It's going to be a problem.
SPEAKER_00: And when the speaker is on the...
SPEAKER_00: Well, let's leave it open for us later to see.
SPEAKER_00: But because we have to re-value it anyway.
SPEAKER_00: Well, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: No, well, the agenda says it's value-weight now.
SPEAKER_02: So I think...
SPEAKER_00: Okay, for now it's a six or a seven or a six maybe.
SPEAKER_00: But the retrieval or the...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but I don't know if it's very...
SPEAKER_02: I think that's very innovative for our control.
SPEAKER_03: How would you innovate a remote control more?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, more through like...
SPEAKER_00: TV function add- To put it on your head?
SPEAKER_00: No, you know what I mean.
SPEAKER_00: You must be innovative technology for remote control more...
SPEAKER_00: Yes, sure.
SPEAKER_00:...in how you control stuff, not in how you find your...
SPEAKER_00: I definitely don't think it's a five.
SPEAKER_00: Let's think about it later on.
SPEAKER_02: The remote control is easy to use.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, as a one or a two, at least.
SPEAKER_02: I think a two, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's good.
SPEAKER_02: More on.
SPEAKER_02: The remote control hasn't got...
SPEAKER_00: I want to see that one before.
SPEAKER_00: How do you skip one?
SPEAKER_02: I've just filled...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That way.
SPEAKER_03: You like the buttons?
SPEAKER_02: I've found 12 questions so much, but it's still a...
SPEAKER_00: The remote control will be bought by...
SPEAKER_02: It will be bought by people under the age of 14.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, definitely.
SPEAKER_03: In comparing with people of...
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no, no, no, just if they buy it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, what do you think?
SPEAKER_01: I think too.
SPEAKER_01: I think too.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not talking too.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, too.
SPEAKER_03: But only when you compare it with elderly.
SPEAKER_03: There's no comparison.
SPEAKER_00: There's no comparison.
SPEAKER_00: It's just...
SPEAKER_00: It will be bought by people under the age of 14.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you can be very...
SPEAKER_00: And I don't need to be guessing.
SPEAKER_00: I just made it.
SPEAKER_03: We'll make it a two.
SPEAKER_03: When it succeeds, it can get a two...
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_02: The remote control has recognizable corporate image.
SPEAKER_02: Color, logo or slogan.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Slogan is quite obvious in there.
SPEAKER_02: All the slogan?
SPEAKER_00: Sorry, no, no, no, no, the slogan.
SPEAKER_00: You can put that on the side if we would like.
SPEAKER_03: On the next side.
SPEAKER_03: Encrypted.
SPEAKER_03: And I will...
SPEAKER_00: I'm gonna do this.
SPEAKER_00: I still think it's gonna be a two or three.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe a three this time.
SPEAKER_02: Three?
SPEAKER_02: I agree.
SPEAKER_02: Because of the slogan in there.
SPEAKER_02: Remote control's got a basic design intended for no...
SPEAKER_00: It's a one or two.
SPEAKER_02: Two.
SPEAKER_02: Two?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, make it two.
SPEAKER_00: Two.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: We've got to add up this course now to see our total average...
SPEAKER_02: Four, five, seven, nine.
SPEAKER_02: Look at that.
SPEAKER_02: 15, 17, 21, 24, 26.
SPEAKER_02: 26.
SPEAKER_02: It's a 2.6.
SPEAKER_00: Not that bad.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's mostly...
SPEAKER_00: When we score higher on innovative technology, we would score it too.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Which is quite a great...
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: This was the evaluation.
SPEAKER_02: This was my evaluation.
SPEAKER_00: Because I still think that the most important part of this meeting still has...
SPEAKER_02: It's pretty nice job.
SPEAKER_02: Until now.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Is this your...
SPEAKER_02: Is this something after this meeting?
SPEAKER_02: Well, I think we've got to fill out another question now.
None: Okay.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It's still open, do I know?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, finance.
SPEAKER_00: Because I received a spreadsheet.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but I actually don't need this presentation.
SPEAKER_00: That's not a matter.
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to open the spreadsheet and we're going to work this out together.
SPEAKER_00: Because I didn't really finish it.
SPEAKER_00: But we will see we'll stumble upon some problems.
SPEAKER_02: We'll probably walk.
SPEAKER_00: We'll look for it.
SPEAKER_00: I'm probably already opened it here.
SPEAKER_00: Let's try it again.
SPEAKER_00: First of all, all the docking stations and costs and such are not included in this list.
SPEAKER_00: But let's start with the need.
SPEAKER_00: We include one battery.
SPEAKER_00: I'll explain the components.
SPEAKER_00: Our list is over here.
SPEAKER_00: The price is given.
SPEAKER_00: We...
SPEAKER_00: The amount, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we indicate the amount of components.
SPEAKER_00: The specific component, how much we need of them.
SPEAKER_00: And then, don't watch the number yet.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if it's filled in properly.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, we need one battery.
SPEAKER_00: One battery.
SPEAKER_00: I think we're going to use enough.
SPEAKER_00: We don't need connectics, solar cells, hand on ammo.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, this is the first problem.
SPEAKER_00: I think we should know how many simple chips, regular chips...
SPEAKER_03:...is one chip, but what you have to choose one for it.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: But a simple chip is enough, I think.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: With the lights in the retrieval, we can be...
SPEAKER_02: I haven't got an idea on which we need to use.
SPEAKER_00: I think it was your job in the first meet, your first presentation to make this clear.
SPEAKER_00: But then you had some time problems.
SPEAKER_00: But do you know what chip we need?
SPEAKER_03: The email I got said, simple chip, when we put in the speaker and the retriever device, it will cost a bit more, like I think the advanced chip, maybe.
SPEAKER_02: And how do you know?
SPEAKER_02: You got that email.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe you can look it up right now.
SPEAKER_03: I didn't know about the retriever or...
SPEAKER_00: When we leave the retriever in such a site, it would be a simple chip.
SPEAKER_00: And with the retriever, it would be an advanced chip.
SPEAKER_02: I'd point out the advanced chip for now, I guess.
SPEAKER_00: That would be enough for a future recommendation.
SPEAKER_00: There will be a lot of problems.
SPEAKER_00: The simple sensor, simple speaker.
SPEAKER_00: Is that the speaker?
SPEAKER_00: I don't know what it is.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, we went for the double curved case, made out of plastic and rubber.
SPEAKER_00: And with a special color.
SPEAKER_00: I guess that's what we were.
SPEAKER_01: Well, special color.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I don't know about the special color.
SPEAKER_03: Otherwise, you can't stand the plastic color.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think we have a special color.
SPEAKER_02: Stand the rubber.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, then the push button.
SPEAKER_00: I was just counting them.
SPEAKER_00: I think you have to indicate the amount of push buttons we want to use.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yes.
SPEAKER_00: Well, that's a bit of a problem.
SPEAKER_00: But I really don't understand that.
SPEAKER_00: Because I can imagine a remote control with far more push buttons.
SPEAKER_00: And it wouldn't be possible according to this sheet.
SPEAKER_01: The simplest buttons.
SPEAKER_03: No, it's only when you use push buttons, it will cost that much.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_02: If you use a scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_02: A mount.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the yellow row is the amount.
SPEAKER_00: You're in the number of components you plan to use in the five.
SPEAKER_00: So the total cost.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe it's the kind of push buttons.
SPEAKER_03: You can have four kinds of push buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Rubber.
SPEAKER_01: You can have one or is that nine?
SPEAKER_00: And I count them like this.
SPEAKER_00: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
SPEAKER_00: You have 12 and 13 because this is one.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, 12.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, then it will be 18.
SPEAKER_00: Because I rated them as a.
SPEAKER_00: This is a report.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: And I think that.
SPEAKER_00: I think that.
SPEAKER_00: Plus the mute button.
SPEAKER_00: And it will be 18.
SPEAKER_02: 18.
SPEAKER_02: One, two, three, four, five.
SPEAKER_03: Why is that so expensive?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I don't understand.
SPEAKER_00: I don't get the point because it would be.
SPEAKER_00: So relatively so expensive.
SPEAKER_00: Just these small buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Is it cents?
SPEAKER_01: The 50 cents of butter.
SPEAKER_02: Or one single stupid button.
SPEAKER_02: So when you.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, let's make it just one.
SPEAKER_03: It's 80% of the price of the.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, now it's now it's already.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, exactly.
SPEAKER_00: Sure, we just.
SPEAKER_00: Give our own interpretation to it because else we would really have a problem.
SPEAKER_00: It would be impossible to make it.
SPEAKER_02: I couldn't understand it if it was 50 cents per.
SPEAKER_02: And per button.
SPEAKER_03: When you have the same amount of button, you have to put it in a carton.
SPEAKER_00: And that's what is then this.
SPEAKER_00: Isn't possible.
SPEAKER_00: This is the most simple.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it is possible.
SPEAKER_00: But we've never seen one before.
SPEAKER_03: I've seen one remote control.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, without the numbers.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, only with the.
SPEAKER_03: Page up, page down.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but I wouldn't want to own that.
SPEAKER_02: That's.
SPEAKER_02: It's still for little children.
SPEAKER_03: They can handle that remote control.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but it takes would also be impossible.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, it's for it's just for a little.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, we'll just.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, but then still when we.
SPEAKER_00: There is no room for a darkening station or something.
SPEAKER_00: Let's see, we have a button supplements.
SPEAKER_00: We'll give the button a special color.
SPEAKER_00: We'll give them a special form.
SPEAKER_00: I think we should mark the special form thing because this will be some special form.
SPEAKER_00: St. Corporated in these big buttons, I guess.
SPEAKER_00: Because the buttons will be that will be matching color between the buttons and the rubber surroundings.
SPEAKER_00: I think that's what they mean by a special color.
SPEAKER_00: Why is it?
SPEAKER_00: I think all the special color things have to be marked over here because that's what we were planning to do making it.
SPEAKER_03: Special form also.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, special material also because there's rubber and the buttons have to be rubber.
SPEAKER_03: What is the normal material?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Classic, I think.
SPEAKER_03: Classic.
SPEAKER_03: Classic.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, but the problem now is that there's no such thing as a darkening station in this list.
SPEAKER_00: But we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a darkening station for 30 cents.
SPEAKER_03: But we can sell the remote control and sell the darkening station separately.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, no.
SPEAKER_03: We don't have to tell it, but what we can say can almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the darkening station.
SPEAKER_00: Never mind, I do like that idea.
SPEAKER_00: But then the darkening station isn't relevant for this project anymore when we come.
SPEAKER_03: No, but then why should we still have to use it?
SPEAKER_00: We have to find out what chip we need.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I really don't get it.
SPEAKER_02: I think we can all go this way.
SPEAKER_00: I think a special color thing has to be marked.
SPEAKER_00: Because I think we...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think that's what they...
SPEAKER_03: But for two euros and 30 cents we don't get a darkening station.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: But can we find out about the chips?
SPEAKER_00: Because when we don't need a darkening station then probably we also need a simple chip.
SPEAKER_01: And then we can get a nice...
SPEAKER_00: Then we can do something extra.
SPEAKER_00: But still it's going to get more expensive with a simple...
SPEAKER_00: And we have some money left.
SPEAKER_00: We can put...
SPEAKER_00: Then for two euros...
SPEAKER_00: We can put a scroll wheel on it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we'll... who knows?
SPEAKER_02: Ah, why?
SPEAKER_00: I mean, a bit of titanium.
SPEAKER_02: If it would cost two euros, I had a total thing and it would be nice too.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, we're not going to add...
SPEAKER_02: But what...
SPEAKER_00: What can we do?
SPEAKER_00: How are we going to do the kinetic cells?
SPEAKER_00: That's also maybe an idea.
SPEAKER_01: So what can we do with a simple chip?
SPEAKER_01: What's different with the regular chip?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, that's what it is to find out.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe you can find it in your email right now.
SPEAKER_00: And we know...
SPEAKER_00: And we exactly know what it will cost us.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe it's that... that's nice to know.
SPEAKER_01: Correct your chip.
SPEAKER_01: Because we don't have special functions to use...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but when we...
SPEAKER_01: A palm chip, for example, on the hand in normal.
SPEAKER_00: But when we skip...
SPEAKER_00: When we don't use the...
SPEAKER_00: So we're not going to make the docking station.
SPEAKER_00: Then we still...
SPEAKER_00: And we need something else, maybe, to make it kind of special.
SPEAKER_00: Because that was our special function.
SPEAKER_02: You can make a plain docking station for two euros.
SPEAKER_00: We'll go back...
SPEAKER_00: Okay, you can also do the...
SPEAKER_00: But...
SPEAKER_00: Without the recharge...
SPEAKER_00: It still is a special remote control.
SPEAKER_00: You know, it's for a special one.
SPEAKER_02: But we can make a docking station for two euros.
SPEAKER_02: If you don't put the recharge function in it.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, it has a shape.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but of course, we have two euros.
SPEAKER_00: And we still...
SPEAKER_00: Maybe we have to use the advanced chip.
SPEAKER_00: And two euros isn't even possible.
SPEAKER_02: Why should that not be possible?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, because then we...
SPEAKER_00: Three cents left.
SPEAKER_02: Now, for the docking station, if you choose a simple chip.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I don't know, because maybe...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we'll find out what it's saying.
SPEAKER_01: If we're doing...
SPEAKER_01: Do we need an advanced chip?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and we are...
SPEAKER_00: And what is this?
SPEAKER_00: A sample sample.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know if it's a...
SPEAKER_03: It isn't in my information.
SPEAKER_03: I've got a...
SPEAKER_03: A schematic view of the remote control.
SPEAKER_03: But nothing about advanced chips or...
SPEAKER_00: Let's...
SPEAKER_00: You can look at it for presentation.
SPEAKER_00: Technical functions?
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: I've got the error...
SPEAKER_03: I will put a page on it.
SPEAKER_03: When my mouse works again.
SPEAKER_03: My mouse is...
SPEAKER_03: Dead.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Reanimated.
SPEAKER_02: Dead.
SPEAKER_03: Ah, I forgot it.
SPEAKER_03: I will put my email on the...
SPEAKER_03:...network.
SPEAKER_02: What the hell are these?
SPEAKER_03: It's on it.
SPEAKER_02: What a...
SPEAKER_01: Here it's open.
None: I don't think here is in here already.
None: There's only just...
SPEAKER_01: Something about...
SPEAKER_01: There's nothing about...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: At the end of the work...
SPEAKER_01: There's an infrared LED.
SPEAKER_00: And in the presentation of yours, there was also something about different components.
SPEAKER_00: Which one was it?
SPEAKER_00: Fictional requirements?
SPEAKER_02: No, that was my first one.
SPEAKER_01: Components designed maybe.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, that was mine.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, that was the second one.
SPEAKER_03: But that was my second.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it was my second.
SPEAKER_00: Your first presentation.
SPEAKER_02: It's at the bottom.
SPEAKER_02: Where it comes from?
SPEAKER_02: It's at your taskbar.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but it's the other one.
SPEAKER_01: Oh.
SPEAKER_01: This is not a work in design or components.
SPEAKER_00: Not the right one.
SPEAKER_02: I don't...
SPEAKER_02: Okay, sorry.
SPEAKER_00: No, this is the other one.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe something is...
SPEAKER_00: Maybe there's something about...
SPEAKER_00: In these chipset?
SPEAKER_03: This is the same...
SPEAKER_03: This is only the possibilities.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We can use a simple regular or advanced chip.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, nice.
SPEAKER_00: You know that a push button requires a simple chip, but a scroll wheel...
SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_00: The regular tool is the hybrid.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so we only need a simple chip.
SPEAKER_03: With a light.
SPEAKER_01: Little light.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but that's just the same as the...
SPEAKER_00: No, this is a simple chip.
SPEAKER_00: The scroll wheel...
SPEAKER_00: It only states that the scroll wheel requires a regular chip, and that a display requires an advanced chip.
SPEAKER_02: This play is, of course, a version of that.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think that...
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: Just a little light.
SPEAKER_01: I think a normal, simple chip, will be okay.
SPEAKER_01: I agree.
SPEAKER_00: And what's the simple sensor slash simple speaker?
SPEAKER_03: Maybe you can say against remote page...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Page up page down.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I guess so too.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's not what we want.
SPEAKER_02: Well, we might want it, but...
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: All in 12 euros...
SPEAKER_03: Back to the car.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: 12 euros and 50 cents.
SPEAKER_03: We're going to use a simple chip.
SPEAKER_02: Great.
SPEAKER_02: The lead.
SPEAKER_03: And the lights.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, there's no...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, they're free, I guess.
SPEAKER_02: Get a glory.
SPEAKER_00: No, there is so many left to be spent.
SPEAKER_01: Can we do it?
SPEAKER_02: We think we can make a down here.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, but what we have to think about now is that...
SPEAKER_00: Is this still a special remote control?
SPEAKER_00: I mean, it hasn't got any innovative technology.
SPEAKER_00: We're not going to apply any innovative technology anyway, I think.
SPEAKER_00: I don't see any possibility to do so because it wouldn't fit our...
SPEAKER_00: The original philosophy.
SPEAKER_00: But is there some extra...
SPEAKER_00: Maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something instead of the rechargeable...
SPEAKER_00: The rechargeable thing was something to...
SPEAKER_00: So people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe if we put the kinetic thing in...
SPEAKER_00: But sometimes you put it...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I know, but still they will think about that.
SPEAKER_00: I mean...
SPEAKER_03: Canetics are now the only use in watches.
SPEAKER_00: It's made for us people.
SPEAKER_00: If it was a useless technology, they wouldn't put it as a possibility.
SPEAKER_00: A solar system, I use this.
SPEAKER_00: The targets group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of thinking.
SPEAKER_00: Because I think when there was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic power source, then it would be this one.
SPEAKER_00: Because it gets thrown around a lot and gets used a lot.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe that's a cool thing about it.
SPEAKER_00: You know, you don't use batteries.
SPEAKER_00: I've never seen it before in a remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Then we can make a docking station.
SPEAKER_02: Five minutes.
SPEAKER_00: No, we can't make a docking station anyway.
SPEAKER_02: That's not true.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we can also...
SPEAKER_00: We can make a docking station.
SPEAKER_00: Why not?
SPEAKER_01: Look at now.
SPEAKER_01: We got two...
SPEAKER_01: Two-thirty.
SPEAKER_01: Two-thirty left.
SPEAKER_01: We can't get an exact docking station.
SPEAKER_03: We can make a docking station with a cable, with buttons on it.
SPEAKER_03: Sure.
SPEAKER_03: With retrieval, dividing it.
SPEAKER_02: The power device is very cheap.
SPEAKER_02: That's just a regular power cable.
SPEAKER_00: It would be serious.
SPEAKER_00: Then the docking station would be...
SPEAKER_00: With a button, the price of the remote control.
SPEAKER_03: With a button to retrieve it, so it will beep.
SPEAKER_03: So it's wireless.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but we don't...
SPEAKER_00: We haven't looked at the discourse of the speaker and other stuff.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think it's realistically to do so.
SPEAKER_02: Well, then it's useless project.
SPEAKER_02: Look at the case.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, because we...
SPEAKER_03: The case of a...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, then we don't have to...
SPEAKER_00: Look at all these special stuff we have.
SPEAKER_00: The colors are special.
SPEAKER_00: The form is special.
SPEAKER_00: It's this whole concept.
SPEAKER_00: And maybe with the kinetic thing, I think we could do a compromise with the kinetic thing.
SPEAKER_02: Can we say 15 euros?
SPEAKER_02: No, it's the...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I mean...
SPEAKER_03: No, then we have to sell it for 30 euros.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: No, we already make less profit of it.
SPEAKER_02: You can sell for 27.5.
SPEAKER_02: Then you make as much profit as you would with 12.5 production costs.
SPEAKER_00: My suggestion is just forget about the whole talking station thing and make it like...
SPEAKER_00: I still...
SPEAKER_00: I also feel this concept of making it kinetic.
SPEAKER_00: Because of the...
SPEAKER_00: You know, it gives something dynamic to the remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe we can do both in the remote.
SPEAKER_03: Battery and kinetic.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_00: No, that wouldn't...
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: 1320.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and it is also not a good...
SPEAKER_00: And I think that...
SPEAKER_00: You really do it only kinetic.
SPEAKER_00: You don't want to think about batteries anymore.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, but only kinetic.
SPEAKER_00: No, no.
SPEAKER_03: Then you have to shake it.
SPEAKER_03: And oh, when it's empty.
SPEAKER_03: It's great.
SPEAKER_02: It's great.
SPEAKER_02: Throw it through the room like 20 times an hour.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no.
SPEAKER_00: It's very sophisticated, not only the technology.
SPEAKER_00: When you...
SPEAKER_00: You're remote like once a day or maybe even less.
SPEAKER_03: No, that's not true.
SPEAKER_03: A watch is kinetic.
SPEAKER_03: Because you walk all the time.
SPEAKER_00: We can make it.
SPEAKER_00: No, we can...
SPEAKER_00: But the remote control gets...
SPEAKER_00: Why do they state that this technology can't be used to it?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, solar cells are also stated.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but a calculator also works on solar cells.
SPEAKER_03: Why are you...
SPEAKER_03: You solar cells, then.
SPEAKER_00: Because I think the whole dynamic part...
SPEAKER_00: It appeals to me thinking of our design philosophy, you know, with the rubber parts and...
SPEAKER_00: Sturdiness of the thing and when you move it around a lot, then people find the idea funny.
SPEAKER_00: And when I move my remote control around them.
SPEAKER_02: That's true.
SPEAKER_02: It's funny for a week.
SPEAKER_02: I guess something like that, where you have to move it around very frequently.
SPEAKER_02: Is the moment...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but you don't have to.
SPEAKER_00: Trust me, the idea of this technology is that you don't think about it just happens.
SPEAKER_02: No, I don't move my...
SPEAKER_02: Okay, we don't have to do it.
SPEAKER_00: But what...
SPEAKER_00: That we just have a lack of key futures.
SPEAKER_00: You have to put something on your box to make people buy it.
SPEAKER_00: We can't really do the docking thing.
SPEAKER_00: It's not...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we can do it, but it would be easy way out.
SPEAKER_03: You can do it for 50 cents.
SPEAKER_02: We've got more than 50 cents.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, but we have to do...
SPEAKER_00: The case alone is...
SPEAKER_00: It's only a familiar left or something.
SPEAKER_03: The case alone for a remote control is at least one euro.
SPEAKER_03: Then we have one euro, 30, for the whole docking station.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, we can leave it on bad...
SPEAKER_00: Then our concept is ready.
SPEAKER_01: Keep remote control.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we make some extra profit on that.
SPEAKER_02: No, we bond.
SPEAKER_02: But that's...
SPEAKER_02: No, it won't sell, but...
SPEAKER_02: Any ideas?
SPEAKER_02: Of course not.
SPEAKER_03: Great, is he?
SPEAKER_03: It's great.
SPEAKER_01: We just have to go all what we did today again.
SPEAKER_01: We have to do it over.
SPEAKER_02: We'll come back tomorrow, okay?
SPEAKER_00: No, there's still some concepts and some special left.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's going to excel in the field of design and looks and feel.
SPEAKER_00: That's what makes it special.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, and I would like...
SPEAKER_00: I would have liked the kinetic part as well to give it some...
SPEAKER_00: Just to give it some extra special future.
SPEAKER_00: I know it will work.
SPEAKER_00: They're not putting technology on this list if it was impossible to...
SPEAKER_00: To make it happen.
SPEAKER_03: Why not a hand, I don't know, then.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, but we'll leave like this.
SPEAKER_00: Then it's...
SPEAKER_02: We can't do anything else.
SPEAKER_03: We're done.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, is this it?
SPEAKER_00: We're going to...
SPEAKER_00: Okay, we'll put the last sheet.
SPEAKER_02: Now we can't.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we have to...
SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes, celebration.
SPEAKER_02: I don't see why, but...
SPEAKER_02: I think we've got to fill out another questioner to be honest.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah?
SPEAKER_02: I don't hear a bell.
None: No, not yet.
SPEAKER_04: All right, I'll see you guys in a minute.
SPEAKER_02: Bye.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_02: Can we do it here?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_03: Just fill that one in.
SPEAKER_01: Now we're doing now.
SPEAKER_01: But it's all in your room.
None: So there are two more questions.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_01: Nice.
None: We're done.
