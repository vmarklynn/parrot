SPEAKER_01: I put that back there.
None: Oh no, get this thing.
SPEAKER_03: No, it was up there and not here.
SPEAKER_03: Now it's here and not there.
SPEAKER_03: And then one more time it should come up the right way around.
SPEAKER_00: Ah.
SPEAKER_00: Hi Kate.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, carry on.
SPEAKER_03: All right.
SPEAKER_03: This is the beginning of the third meeting, the conceptual design meeting.
SPEAKER_03: Our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting.
SPEAKER_03: I have the minutes from the previous meeting on the shared drive at this point.
SPEAKER_03: And we should each have a presentation to make.
SPEAKER_03: We have certain decisions to make and we have 40 minutes total.
SPEAKER_03: It's 25 after two at the moment.
SPEAKER_03: So 40 minutes is 5 after three.
SPEAKER_03: Which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: They're the decisions we have to turn to but we'll come back to them in a minute after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting.
SPEAKER_03: All right.
SPEAKER_03: As we remember, I opened the meeting before us for present.
SPEAKER_03: The meeting, the first meetings minutes were reviewed and approved.
SPEAKER_03: Sarah, you presented a marketing research report.
SPEAKER_03: Which pretty much represented that 15, 35 year olds has to be handheld.
SPEAKER_03: Power channel volume number keys, possibly your speech recognition.
SPEAKER_03: And then Steph did the second presentation.
SPEAKER_03: That those functions plus streamlining them with big user friendly keys that were easy to use.
SPEAKER_03: I think all of us agreed with those things.
SPEAKER_03: Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard.
SPEAKER_03: That it should be a simple mass produced device because of the 12.5 pence cost.
SPEAKER_03: But we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place is a selling point.
SPEAKER_03: And the new requirements that it could be for TV only.
SPEAKER_03: And that it include the so slogan and color of the corporate design being included.
SPEAKER_03: The corporate image. So we agreed that the target market would be 15 to 35 with more money than cents that were decision makers alternatively would be a manufacturer to enclose with TV, but it still should meet those parameters.
SPEAKER_03: And the function we agreed was volume power numbers enter channels away to move between channels easy to use and handheld.
SPEAKER_03: At that point, we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition.
SPEAKER_03: What what are the current ones sell for?
SPEAKER_03: And Steph was going to look at economics. Kate was going to look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed.
SPEAKER_03: And I was to type up these minutes and work on the final report.
SPEAKER_03: Is this a fair presentation?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: What our last meeting was.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_03: So we're ready to close that and go back to our.
SPEAKER_03: That one.
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_03: We're up to the point of the.
SPEAKER_03: Go back.
SPEAKER_03: The three presentations.
SPEAKER_03: So we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to Sarah.
SPEAKER_03: Is that okay?
SPEAKER_03: Is that right with everybody else?
SPEAKER_03: Especially since Kate asked to be last.
SPEAKER_03: Sarah, I'm sorry if I misspelled your name.
SPEAKER_03: I didn't know what this essay or a or a.
SPEAKER_03: You respond to whatever you get.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Did you do your.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: There it is.
SPEAKER_00: Ta-da.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Sorry.
SPEAKER_02: I'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: I think that's a good idea.
SPEAKER_03: I think that's a good idea.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Are we talking about the device itself or a cover for the device that be an interchangeable cover as a separate product?
SPEAKER_03: I think that's a good idea.
SPEAKER_02: Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
None: I think it might be more useful if Kate went next.
SPEAKER_01: I think it might be more useful if she went next.
SPEAKER_02: I think it might be more useful if she went next.
SPEAKER_02: I think it might be more useful if she went next.
SPEAKER_02: I think it might be more useful if she went next.
SPEAKER_02: I think it might be more useful if she went next.
SPEAKER_02: I think it might be more useful if she went next.
SPEAKER_02: This is a remote that's been opened up.
SPEAKER_02: This is a push button.
SPEAKER_02: This is a basic construction that we've got to accommodate.
SPEAKER_02: We've got to accommodate.
SPEAKER_02: I want to go through not just addressing the points that you made to the area but doing my presentation in the order I wrote it.
SPEAKER_02: First of all, I want to talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source.
SPEAKER_02: We can have your bogs found at double AA batteries, replaceable little compartment.
SPEAKER_02: We can have a hand.
SPEAKER_02: A wind up.
SPEAKER_02: A wind up.
SPEAKER_02: A wind up.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's quite interesting.
SPEAKER_02: You actually get the energy by moving the device.
SPEAKER_02: We had talked about solar power but I think we agreed that that's not so good in the dark.
SPEAKER_02: I'm afraid this is the options we've got on the case.
SPEAKER_02: The nearest we've got to sponge you there.
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to come back to the advantage of titanium.
SPEAKER_02: The interface looks like push button.
SPEAKER_02: You can have multiple scroll buttons.
SPEAKER_02: We can also incorporate LCD display in the mode.
SPEAKER_02: The electronics makes the device work.
SPEAKER_02: We can have three simple regular advanced and the price goes up.
SPEAKER_02: If we want the nice cheap one, we can only have push buttons.
SPEAKER_02: If you want the advanced chip, you can obviously cost small but you need a real LCD display.
SPEAKER_02: The manufacturing division tell me they have recently developed sample sensor, speaker devices.
SPEAKER_02: The real expertise is in push buttons.
SPEAKER_02: We have two options.
SPEAKER_02: We can either go for a cheap model.
SPEAKER_02: We can have something that looks a bit nicer.
SPEAKER_02: It could have an LCD screen and multiple scroll buttons.
SPEAKER_02: It could have the company's new development of the sample sensor and speaker.
SPEAKER_00: I'm afraid I don't have that information available.
SPEAKER_00: I'm afraid I don't have that information.
SPEAKER_00: The company has the colors and styles of the company.
SPEAKER_01: I've been thinking of something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colors of the real reaction company.
SPEAKER_01: I've been interested in how to use the real reaction company.
SPEAKER_02: I've been interested in how to use the real reaction company.
SPEAKER_01: I've showed you my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you Kate.
SPEAKER_01: You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got.
SPEAKER_01: FN and F8.
SPEAKER_02: If you do what you can, F8 to get it.
SPEAKER_03: Keep doing it until you get it in both.
SPEAKER_03: Just do it again.
SPEAKER_01: I don't have a huge amount of information.
SPEAKER_01: My method was to look at my inspiration.
SPEAKER_01: I've been interested in the iPod style scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: I couldn't find the picture of the iPod on the link to the web.
SPEAKER_01: I was thinking that I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_01: I was thinking that I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_01: I was thinking that I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_01: I was thinking that I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_01: I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_01: I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_01: I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_01: I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_01: I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_01: I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_01: I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_01: I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_01: I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_02: I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_01: I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_02: I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_01: I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_01: I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_01: I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_01: I was really simple interface with a couple of scroll things on it.
SPEAKER_01: I quite like it because it's just smooth and handheld and it's got these easily reachable buttons that are quite nicely spaced out.
SPEAKER_01: Something a bit like that where buttons are arranged in a circle up there and left right.
SPEAKER_01: You want scroll buttons in that as well.
SPEAKER_01: I can't write it.
SPEAKER_01: I think right.
SPEAKER_01: On the right, down at the bottom, you see where the mouse is.
SPEAKER_01: This style thing where you have up, down, left and right.
SPEAKER_01: Enter in the middle, so you pick your menu and then your different options.
SPEAKER_01: When you click on each one, you can go into a new menu for that.
SPEAKER_01: I'm getting a bit specific here.
SPEAKER_01: Really with that.
SPEAKER_02: You use something to show you the nice design.
SPEAKER_02: It's playing towards strengths, which are in push-button technology.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think I can get up on this screen.
SPEAKER_01: Here we go.
SPEAKER_01: Well, the iPod spinning wheel is really complicated.
SPEAKER_01: It does scroll but it is hugely complicated.
SPEAKER_01: I'll ask if it does.
SPEAKER_01: Then that's terrible.
SPEAKER_01: But they all have this feature of this...
SPEAKER_01: It's not quite a scroll wheel, but it's a selection.
SPEAKER_01: It's a kind of selection in this circle, which I think is a really good idea.
SPEAKER_02: But we can implement it in simple push buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Which is much cheaper, like, up down, left and right.
SPEAKER_01: Which is good.
SPEAKER_01: And then...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so either a channel up and down, volume up and down.
SPEAKER_01: The next appearing programs up and down.
SPEAKER_01: And then also, when you get to the different menus on the screen, it's got different settings and contrasts.
SPEAKER_01: So all you really need is these four buttons with the end-turned-the-middle.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And that's it.
SPEAKER_02: Exactly.
SPEAKER_02: Look at this one.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, that's really nice.
SPEAKER_01: Almost impossible to misplace all these.
SPEAKER_00: You might take up your whole living room.
SPEAKER_00: Possibly?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We could actually do it in rubber instead of plaster, if you'd rather.
SPEAKER_03: Or cold or banana.
SPEAKER_00: Have it in your room.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: There's just something else I need to bring to your attention.
SPEAKER_01: Have you seen these on a remote?
SPEAKER_01: This is actually the volume up and down.
SPEAKER_01: But they both say V on them.
SPEAKER_01: Which, when you first look at it, you expect that to be the down.
SPEAKER_01: Because it looks like a downward pointing arrow, but it's actually the V to indicate that it's the volume.
SPEAKER_01: So we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these.
SPEAKER_01: But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down.
SPEAKER_01: If we're having this scroll wheel, then it's going to double up as all the other up and down functions.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So, I think we're going to have a little bit more complicated.
SPEAKER_03: I want to thank you all for all your presentations.
SPEAKER_03: We have about 10 minutes left in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts.
SPEAKER_03: And I think you all have been self-stimulating of working together.
SPEAKER_03: We need to come up with some specifics of the components, the materials, things like making the decision on the energy.
SPEAKER_03: And the case and the interface type things.
SPEAKER_03: So, let's...
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_03: They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use?
SPEAKER_03: Which the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery, kinetic, or solar.
SPEAKER_03: This is where Kate's expertise comes in.
SPEAKER_03: And our decision-making will be a little bit guided by Kate at this point.
SPEAKER_03: You were saying that the kinetic would be useful.
SPEAKER_03: That is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it as opposed to battery that you have to either put it in the rechargeer or keep replacing batteries.
SPEAKER_03: Or solar that you'd have difficulty with it.
SPEAKER_03: If it's a dark day that it will die on you in no way to do it.
SPEAKER_03: That's the day you want to use the TV.
SPEAKER_03: So, what's our pleasure here? What would be the cost consequences of each of the three?
SPEAKER_02: Well, unfortunately I don't have cost of information.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: In terms of workability, I think the two front ones are the standard battery or the kinetic.
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to say I don't have to pick it up because I'm a different person cost.
SPEAKER_00: What's the feelings of a group form kinetic?
SPEAKER_01: Sounds great. I've never come across it before but it sounds fantastic.
SPEAKER_01: Sounds like it could be really good economical.
SPEAKER_01: It would make the whole thing a lot lighter.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's really quite attractive thought, isn't it?
SPEAKER_01: It's like, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So the consent seems to be used to kinetic if it's at all possible.
SPEAKER_01: But it does depend how much it costs.
SPEAKER_01: How much more development and research it leads.
SPEAKER_02: And how much you do have to keep it moving.
SPEAKER_02: It's conscious that what you do can be quite a set of productivity.
SPEAKER_01: So your exercise is where you're watching the TV.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, more environmentally friendly.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, so I think it is a thanks for a month or five minutes to finish.
SPEAKER_03: Thanks.
SPEAKER_03: The next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, right. Okay. That's something I maybe should have covered.
SPEAKER_02: Chip on print is just a manufacturing technique.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, and I would certainly recommend it.
SPEAKER_02: I think because I'm not sure I have an alternative.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: What about way to be the way we progress?
SPEAKER_02: It's actually built to be print onto the circuit board.
SPEAKER_02: Like you might print on the paper.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_03: What about the case?
SPEAKER_03: I think they're talking there about do we want wood plastic titanium or rubber?
SPEAKER_03: And I think we've discussed not having titanium wanted to expensive.
SPEAKER_03: And second, it won't do this double curves.
SPEAKER_03: We sort of eliminated wood who said plastic or rubber.
SPEAKER_03: What's the pleasure?
SPEAKER_02: Well, if Sir is keen on spongy field, the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those stress points.
SPEAKER_02: What about you?
SPEAKER_01: I think it might need a kind of hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside.
SPEAKER_01: And then I kind of spongy cover.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, spongy cover.
SPEAKER_01: So it feels like all things spongy, but actually you're not damaging anything by plastic inside.
SPEAKER_02: Because I mean, I can't do it in many ways.
SPEAKER_02: I can't do it in many ways, but I agree it.
SPEAKER_01: It sounds like an ice-hiding tradition.
SPEAKER_01: You need to get that carried away with things that are packed, then you just want to stroke them a little.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: The thing I want is the user interface concept.
SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry to push you, but we only have a couple minutes to finish.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. And it says, interface.
SPEAKER_03: What type and what supplements?
SPEAKER_01: I just copy the one on the left.
SPEAKER_01: Well, like four buttons up down left and right with enter in the middle.
SPEAKER_01: But we'll correspond to many on the screen.
SPEAKER_02: Which I think technically is just push button.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'd like to push button quite a lot.
SPEAKER_02: And it's something we're in it.
SPEAKER_02: We're completing it.
SPEAKER_01: So push buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So, what's that?
SPEAKER_03: This is going to sound weird, but the next meeting starts 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_03: And they actually want a look and feel design user interface design.
SPEAKER_03: You can look and see this as well as I can.
SPEAKER_03: Marketing, they want product evaluation.
SPEAKER_01: No, it's still plugged in online.
SPEAKER_03: Oh my, I'm sorry.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_03: Sorry about that.
None: Missed that one.
SPEAKER_03: I'm sorry to be fun trying to get this thing to work.
SPEAKER_01: Tada.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think the company's next project should design a better overhead device.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, because I can't even see mine.
SPEAKER_03: Next meeting starts in 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_03: These are the individual actions.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, right.
SPEAKER_03: The look and feel design is for Kate.
SPEAKER_03: Steph gets the user interface design.
SPEAKER_03: You get product evaluation.
SPEAKER_03: The two of you get to play with a plat modeling play.
SPEAKER_03: And to do a prototype.
SPEAKER_03: And everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way.
SPEAKER_03: Anything else we need to do?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: Go to it.
SPEAKER_03: And that's the end of this meeting.
SPEAKER_03: That's for her benefit.
SPEAKER_02: And that's for her benefit.
