SPEAKER_02: This is our final meeting, the detailed design meeting.
SPEAKER_02: Again, I'll take minutes.
SPEAKER_02: What we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from the presentation, so it's what you've been looking for.
SPEAKER_02: There's a record that in Kat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this again.
SPEAKER_02: Then I need to say since a few things about finance because we have to check that it's within the evaluation criteria and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria, Kat and financial limits and then we will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design.
SPEAKER_02: We think so, we've got 40 minutes and then we get to make it a link in the comments.
SPEAKER_02: We missed out.
SPEAKER_02: It's now, I guess that was the start of 1535, so we've got until 4.
SPEAKER_01: How much do we have?
SPEAKER_01: 49.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, about 40 minutes.
SPEAKER_02: Until about 4.15.
SPEAKER_03: So, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, are we starting with the shape and things?
SPEAKER_03: Then I will explain the user interface and things like the buttons and the screw.
SPEAKER_01: Basically, going without trend of vegetables and we selected the color and approximate shape of banana.
SPEAKER_04: You think the banana is the same to you, is it a bit of a panic?
SPEAKER_02: Well, but it's just an approximation.
SPEAKER_02: Do you use perfect?
SPEAKER_02: No, you were making fault.
SPEAKER_01: Basically, it's the flip-open thing again.
SPEAKER_01: We have the, okay, the Mark covered, we'll explain user interface there and it flips open on the side, so it opens like that and we have the user interface in here and the LCD and the school inside.
SPEAKER_01: Well, everything else is probably user interface, so.
SPEAKER_02: And it's the whole thing made of rubber.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It is.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's made of a small and, of course, it will be shiny.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but one thing we actually kind of forgot while designing it, once I was supposed to be rounder, so it's at the backside.
SPEAKER_01: Well, since it's made of rubber anywhere, I think it's here.
SPEAKER_04: It does look like the front's like curvy and then the whole shape's curvy, so I would say that it's curvy.
SPEAKER_03: It looks quite like a vegetable.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and it's spongey as well.
SPEAKER_03: So, the user interface, as we discussed last time, on the cover, we just have the very basic things.
SPEAKER_03: We have that channel, so you're starting from 1, 2, 3, there would be numbers on the actual number.
SPEAKER_03: So, it's up to 4, up to 7, up to 9 and 0.
SPEAKER_03: And then, well, this is on off button.
SPEAKER_03: It's quite standard place for it and also the colour is quite often read, so it's kind of user-friendly.
SPEAKER_03: And then this ones would be for flipping the channels back in like the previous one and the next one.
SPEAKER_03: And we would also have a little thing saying here, previous and the preven, preven next.
SPEAKER_00: Where's the volume?
SPEAKER_03: The volume is scrolling on the side.
SPEAKER_03: You can't see it.
SPEAKER_03: You just did like this.
SPEAKER_03: And it's on the back, cover or back late because if you flip it open, you can still do the scrolling here.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, can I see.
SPEAKER_03: So, the volume is you just scroll, but then once you flip it open, there you have the screen.
SPEAKER_03: And you have the spinning wheel with options to choose, you can move back and forth and then if you need to choose something on the screen, you just push the middle button.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, the thing we forgot was like a mute button.
SPEAKER_03: A mute button.
SPEAKER_03: We will have this on the screen, on the display.
SPEAKER_01: So, on the cover we have the barest and feels.
SPEAKER_04: On the wheel, if you hold the wheel down, then it will.
SPEAKER_01: On the LCD, you know, the main one, you will have the...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, the scrolling is kind of, you have to scroll all the way to make it mute, right?
SPEAKER_04: But if you hold the scrolling click, isn't it?
SPEAKER_04: It's a scrolling click.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, it's a whole mute issue.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And okay, so the voice recognition is also just part of it you can't really see it in the interface.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's hidden in there.
SPEAKER_03: And we do have the logo.
SPEAKER_03: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_03: Very good.
SPEAKER_02: So, I think...
SPEAKER_02: And it's with the black and yellow in the right hand.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I think we could do the logo in grey as it is on the website.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And you have all the resources here.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So, if you have questions, there.
SPEAKER_02: I have a...
SPEAKER_02: Test it out.
SPEAKER_02: I can count.
SPEAKER_02: I can count.
SPEAKER_02: And so, it's an intermediate color logo.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, no, no.
SPEAKER_04: I hope you can see it.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, that's cool.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
None: Very cool.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So, maybe if we go on to evaluation criteria.
SPEAKER_02: Again, we'll...
SPEAKER_02: I suspect we're going to have a couple of minor financial issues.
SPEAKER_02: We'll see.
SPEAKER_02: I'm sure we can get around them somehow.
SPEAKER_02: We'll just send all of them and the factory into some nice poor country.
SPEAKER_02: I'll cut some of the plastic that one.
SPEAKER_04: Wales.
SPEAKER_04: Wales for example.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Right.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: So, what we're going to do is prepare the evaluation of the new design.
SPEAKER_04: So, we're going to be using the 7.0 scale.
SPEAKER_04: So, one is, you know, yes, it totally meets what that requirement.
SPEAKER_04: And 7 is, no, it really doesn't.
SPEAKER_04: We need to go back and start again.
SPEAKER_04: You know, basically what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done.
SPEAKER_04: And we've worked on it and made a list of them.
SPEAKER_04: You know, so that we can evaluate each one and like, so it's about going back to the start and saying, oh, yeah, we did manage to do that.
SPEAKER_04: Or, I know we really forgot about that.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: So, these are what they are.
SPEAKER_02: So, for each of these, we need to give it a 1 to 7.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: I did have a BC and D down here, but it seems to have turned into like just a lot of things.
SPEAKER_04: Never mind.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: But if you can imagine that they say A, B, C and D, that would be really good.
SPEAKER_01: I guess we'll give it a maximum point in everything.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, it's definitely attractive.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I agree.
SPEAKER_03: That was a locatable thing we actually forgot.
SPEAKER_04: Well, I thought you'd kind of say that you'd have a little thing to stick on the TV.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So, I just prepared to prepare one now.
SPEAKER_03: I've got the grid too.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So, be attractive to look at.
SPEAKER_04: That's this one.
SPEAKER_04: What do you all say?
SPEAKER_03: Seven was the maximum, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I go for seven.
SPEAKER_04: It's terrible.
SPEAKER_04: We're also proud of the calendar.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so that will be a seven.
SPEAKER_04: I know you can't watch that up there.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: What I've done on the next page is I've set it up, so we just put the marks in.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Excellent.
SPEAKER_02: Excellent.
SPEAKER_02: We can't.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I'll take a note.
SPEAKER_02: I can take a note.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I'll take a note.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so we're all agreeing on seven for eight.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Does it match the off-wasting behavior of a user?
SPEAKER_00: I think it does.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The only thing that we were considering was that this thing is kind of more for right-hundred people than for left-hundred people.
SPEAKER_01: So, if you're left-hundred, you kind of like a...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, in some way, we might want to do like another model, another version, which is like exactly the Mirai match of this one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That's going to be a problem because you don't always have all left-hundred or all right-hundred in a family.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's not a huge problem because it's not a problem.
SPEAKER_03: I think left-hundred people are already used to discrimination anyway, so they just...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but I mean, because it's not like it's a pen, you know, left-hundred people can't normally write, but they can normally do most things, what I'm saying.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I would say it's not such a big issue.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, because I mean, anyway, right-hundred people would be able to show up.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And if the majority are right-handed...
SPEAKER_04: I mean, you can't have any finger to scroll rather than you thumb.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So, I mean, that does kind of negate the whole RSI issue, so maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation.
SPEAKER_04: I'll give it a five, I would say.
SPEAKER_04: What do you think?
SPEAKER_03: Or maybe six, because it's just one in one of our visions.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think for, I mean, most people are right-handed, so in terms of our greatest target group, I think it's pretty good.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And I think it's one of the planets for management they want to...
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: It might be a little clumsy when it opens up, right?
SPEAKER_01: Or it opens on the side.
SPEAKER_03: No, yeah, but we have it nicely with a hingeship or whatever.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, it won't be a problem, it will be...
SPEAKER_03: And it won't be heavy.
SPEAKER_04: I think the alternative is flipping from the top.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but it's a bit long.
SPEAKER_03: It's a little bit long.
SPEAKER_04: It can be opened like this, of course.
SPEAKER_04: But you were thinking about making it smaller, yeah?
SPEAKER_01: This kind of thing makes more fun.
SPEAKER_01: So you have to keep...
SPEAKER_01: So you have to keep...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but if we flip it open only as much as that.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So it works like a mobile phone flipping, but you know, as long as that side is flat, then that will work.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so see... oh, are we admitting defeat on C or are we saying we're going to stick a locate on the T-Low?
SPEAKER_04: No, we have a look at that.
SPEAKER_02: There's a locate at C.
SPEAKER_04: Cool, so that means...
SPEAKER_04: I've just checked on TV.
SPEAKER_04: That doesn't mean you need to do the speak on it, right?
SPEAKER_04: You know, make it beep.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, well, but the speak...
SPEAKER_03: Simple speakers included, so it has some capacity to do...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03:...to make some sounds.
SPEAKER_04: So, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So, that's seven years.
SPEAKER_04: Yep.
SPEAKER_04: Fabulous.
SPEAKER_04: D.
SPEAKER_01: Intuitive, completely intuitive.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: If this means intuitive, if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's six.
SPEAKER_02: Because the standard layout for numbers is 3, 3, 3, and 1 rather than the way you've got it.
SPEAKER_02: I really like the way you have it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's not the immediate thing that you used to.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And even the scroll, it's a new technology, so it might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the...
SPEAKER_01: So, it is kind of not very intuitive, but it's a good technology.
SPEAKER_02: And it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So, should we maybe say a five and say it is intuitive, but it's different.
SPEAKER_04: So, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Do you know, I mean, it's obvious how to use it, but you might have to think about it first.
SPEAKER_04: So, we give that one a five, do you think?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to give a seven and everything, so...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I'm glad you were accepting this.
SPEAKER_04: I have taken a little while, haven't I?
SPEAKER_04: Intuitive to put...
SPEAKER_04: Sorry, it's really hard to write on this.
SPEAKER_04: I just went a bit mad, didn't I?
SPEAKER_04: Okay, cool.
SPEAKER_04: E.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: I guess this comes back from this whole B thing links in here.
SPEAKER_04: So, possibly for left-handed.
SPEAKER_04: Investigate.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but otherwise it's superb.
SPEAKER_04: So, she give it a six, six, six.
SPEAKER_03: The ergonomic design, well...
SPEAKER_03: I mean, I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, the repetitive stress things, but then who would be really pushing the button so much on the remote control anyway?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, unless you are all the time sitting.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, so it's kind of...
SPEAKER_04: I think it is an honor.
SPEAKER_04: I think it is an effective text today.
SPEAKER_04: And I never got the positive strain.
SPEAKER_04: I can enjoy from that.
SPEAKER_04: So, I find it quite hard to believe, you know?
SPEAKER_01: And moreover, it has the LCD and everything, so that we minimize the pressing of the buttons.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, so we give that a six, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, have a watch.
SPEAKER_03: That's how it happens.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, absolutely.
SPEAKER_04: I want to have a make-sharing up with the things there, but it only have bullet points there.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, that's the second one.
SPEAKER_02: So, you must have changed it on this one, where it's got score, but not on the previous slide.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, okay, cool.
SPEAKER_04: Right.
SPEAKER_04: So, it has voice control?
SPEAKER_04: Yes, so that's a seven, then.
SPEAKER_04: Three, and a little bit more.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, and a little bit more.
SPEAKER_01: It's the most sophisticated mode that I've ever seen.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But in terms of the actual technology, none of it is actually you.
SPEAKER_03: Well, we have the sample speakers, which is...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but I mean, all of the components have been used in other things before.
SPEAKER_03: But at the same time, they're all relatively new.
SPEAKER_04: They've never been used in remote control before, I didn't think.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: What do you reckon?
SPEAKER_02: Five, six.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: What do you think?
SPEAKER_04: Six.
SPEAKER_03: Six.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, how far can you go with a remote control, really?
SPEAKER_03: Well, it still has to do with what it has to do.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but I mean, everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else, really, hasn't it?
SPEAKER_04: I think many people face remote.
SPEAKER_04: That is it.
SPEAKER_02: They can take it with them.
SPEAKER_02: Put fashion in electronics.
SPEAKER_01: Absolutely.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, isn't it?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, sure.
SPEAKER_01: The carrot banana.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's a little bit of a facet.
SPEAKER_03: We give it some fruits and vegetables, and our fashionable days days.
SPEAKER_04: There we go.
SPEAKER_04: I think that's a hundred.
SPEAKER_03: So, I think we've done very well, but...
SPEAKER_03: Go.
SPEAKER_04: We need the average here.
SPEAKER_03: The average is about six and something.
SPEAKER_03: A little bit over six.
None: Seven.
SPEAKER_03: There are how many six?
SPEAKER_03: No way.
SPEAKER_04: A little bit under six.
SPEAKER_04: That's 28.
SPEAKER_04: Three sixes.
SPEAKER_04: And one five.
SPEAKER_04: 18.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, three sixes.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: 28, 38, 4, 7, 6.
SPEAKER_01: 26 and 5.
SPEAKER_01: The C1.
SPEAKER_01: 61, the way it goes.
SPEAKER_03: Six point something.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That's 6.5.
SPEAKER_02: Six point five.
SPEAKER_02: That's close enough.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: That was pretty good, I think.
SPEAKER_02: Now, I'll wait until we get to the final.
SPEAKER_02: If we can afford it.
SPEAKER_02: That's all.
SPEAKER_02: You've got at the moment, or did you have anything there?
SPEAKER_02: No, that's it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
None: So, finance.
SPEAKER_02: And we'll see if we can...
SPEAKER_02: Unscrew this first.
SPEAKER_04: Cool, sorry.
SPEAKER_04: There we go.
SPEAKER_04: I'm just saying.
SPEAKER_04: It's good.
SPEAKER_04: I'm going to get in there in the month.
SPEAKER_02: Beautiful.
SPEAKER_02: Nothing to do.
SPEAKER_02: Mm-hmm.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Is it nice and tall?
SPEAKER_01: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So, we looked at the project at presentation and the evaluation criteria.
SPEAKER_02: And now, we have to count.
SPEAKER_02: We have to calculate the production costs.
SPEAKER_02: So, I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that.
SPEAKER_02: Can you read that?
SPEAKER_02: Almost.
SPEAKER_02: No, less.
SPEAKER_02: I started feeling at the end, but of course, these are provisionals that we have to go down.
SPEAKER_02: No hand dynamo, right?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So, we have a simple battery, no kinetic energy, no solar.
SPEAKER_02: The chip we're going for an advanced chip on print.
SPEAKER_02: We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker.
SPEAKER_02: Yep.
SPEAKER_02: Single curved surface.
SPEAKER_02: So, that we can follow this.
SPEAKER_02: Case material is said rubber.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what special colour means.
SPEAKER_01: Anything, I think, which is not more than one.
SPEAKER_03: At least in colour, yeah, probably.
SPEAKER_03: So, I think this is probably special colour.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but rubber comes.
SPEAKER_02: Rubber comes.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I would maybe it's like if you want titanium colour, or wood.
SPEAKER_03: Or maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing.
SPEAKER_03: Let's leave it as you're.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: You might end up having to take off.
SPEAKER_02: We definitely have to show it up.
SPEAKER_02: So, it's a pushback.
SPEAKER_02: And then we have scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_02: That's why scroll wheel with pushback in my head.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we had from using, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And we have LC display and buttons, supplements.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_03: We're not giving any more.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but we have LC display, but the, the, the, the, the
SPEAKER_02: the spinning wheel. Spinning wheel.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe it's integrated with LC display.
SPEAKER_02: I feel like it's a pushback in there.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think the push button.
SPEAKER_02: Oh.
SPEAKER_04: Because then you have, I don't know if that's why.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, you can only have 25 push buttons in two to do that.
SPEAKER_04: Not counting anything.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So, remember that.
SPEAKER_02: That seems unlikely.
SPEAKER_01: What is the limit?
SPEAKER_02: Whether, whether push button means that we have to count all of the fashion, not doing.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_04: No, it says what, what is the kind of interface?
SPEAKER_01: If it is push button, then you got a 0.5.
SPEAKER_01: It's a scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: So we put it's push button and scroll wheel and LC display.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So that's the three kind of interfaces that we have.
SPEAKER_02: So as we can see, that's way too expensive.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: What's our budget?
SPEAKER_02: 12.5.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The sample sensor will have to go.
SPEAKER_02: Because that's my sister's sister's.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So that's the three kind of interfaces that we have.
SPEAKER_02: That has implications though for the.
SPEAKER_01: It does not have four ways recognition, but it does have for the feedback speaker.
SPEAKER_01: Not when you say, when you press one, it says one or it says hello.
SPEAKER_04: But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And the locator also goes away.
SPEAKER_03: But it was very innovative.
SPEAKER_03: And then it's a way innovative.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I mean, this speaker, the sample speaker is, it's expensive, but we could just have some very, very easy device that just bapes.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Because the sample speaker was, I think, more complicated.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: There you record your samples.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Also, in the case, I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface because it's just rubber.
SPEAKER_01: So it's probably a flat surface rubber.
SPEAKER_01: I mean,
SPEAKER_00: okay.
None: Yeah. So we need 150 off.
SPEAKER_04: See, I was going to say the scroll wheel push button thing,
SPEAKER_02: because take it down to just a scroll. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That means that we cannot press.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, then we will be in the budget in the LCD.
SPEAKER_01: If in the LCD, we can scroll right.
SPEAKER_01: How do we make a selection if you cannot push?
SPEAKER_03: No, no, you can push this one, but we don't have a push button.
SPEAKER_03: We don't have this muting mechanism for this scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_04: But that's, well, you just have to just be in it down.
SPEAKER_02: You can have to scroll it straight, roll it straight down.
SPEAKER_01: So it's the scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and push button thing.
SPEAKER_03: But I mean, we can put an additional mute button on the top as well.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, that wouldn't actually cost anymore.
SPEAKER_04: That's the spin wheel, isn't it?
SPEAKER_04: That can be the LCD.
SPEAKER_02: That's with the LCD.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We decided because it's not on at least.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, so this is...
SPEAKER_02: The scroll wheel is on the side.
SPEAKER_01: So we are adding costs for both, right?
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's the good.
SPEAKER_02: So we're pointing to the other, right?
SPEAKER_02: I think we are at the moment.
SPEAKER_04: Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have push button to the volume.
SPEAKER_04: We can still put them on the side.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, the scroll wheel is pretty cool, but...
SPEAKER_01: Instead of scrolling here, we have two buttons here of wrap and down.
SPEAKER_01: On the side.
SPEAKER_01: Sounds good, actually.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, rather than having three different things that people have to do.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: There we go.
SPEAKER_02: I'll look way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll get bonusy.
SPEAKER_04: And we'll be kidded met to the single curve this time for me.
SPEAKER_02: Or that we have to have some sort of special colour.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So that's all right.
SPEAKER_02: We'll leave it at that and then I'll take it.
SPEAKER_02: I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour if that costs extra that we've still got some space for.
SPEAKER_02: We have.
SPEAKER_02: Excellent.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: So did we lose on our evaluation criteria?
SPEAKER_02: Is there a bit of a problem?
SPEAKER_01: No, I'm not really.
SPEAKER_01: Because we keep all the features, we keep voice recognition, we keep LCD display.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Instead of having scrolling, we just put it in the...
SPEAKER_01: We just show a bit of a gimmick that there's never now anyway.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And the scroll wheel is, I mean, essentially the two buttons that is...
SPEAKER_04: is no way different.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: All right.
SPEAKER_01: But we lose the locator.
SPEAKER_03: Well, we are going to have a beeping thing.
SPEAKER_00: So instead of a speaker.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's not like sample speaker, but it will just beep.
SPEAKER_03: So we still have the little key.
SPEAKER_03: That's not a very exciting colour.
SPEAKER_04: I think you should make it more vegetable-like.
SPEAKER_04: Much colour, the colour of the phone or the colour of the...
SPEAKER_03: Oh, the beeper thing.
SPEAKER_03: Well, it can be yellow as well, it can come in the same colour as the case.
SPEAKER_03: We won't have run out of that.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think Jen wants it to vibrate.
SPEAKER_04: You know, your pen vibrate?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I know.
SPEAKER_04: I know.
SPEAKER_04: But I think it's a very short one.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I know.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So it looks like we designed a banana.
SPEAKER_02: We've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting.
SPEAKER_02: So it would be good if we could just have a little talk about their project itself and how it went so that we can feedback to the management for next time the design of the product.
SPEAKER_02: Cool.
SPEAKER_02: Feedback, I do.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, as far as creativity is concerned, yeah, I think that was the room for creativity.
SPEAKER_03: The only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the budget we had.
SPEAKER_01: I think one thing that was lacking was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And we kept adding things randomly.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So how do you know?
SPEAKER_04: If we don't have the sheet at the beginning, you should have been like, okay, so we can have that option.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, or not.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: We can't.
SPEAKER_01: So all the random decisions at the end could have been.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But in terms of the process of going and working individually and then coming back to the meeting, that works.
SPEAKER_04: I think it was a regular, you know, it wasn't like we were alone for very long.
SPEAKER_04: So you didn't go off and think, wouldn't it be great to have a fine meeting?
SPEAKER_04: I think we could talk.
SPEAKER_04: And then you know, you come back, we need to attend.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, the means were very good.
SPEAKER_03: The means we used.
SPEAKER_03: The whiteboard digital pen.
SPEAKER_04: I like the pens.
SPEAKER_04: I want one.
SPEAKER_04: That would just be so cool to do.
SPEAKER_02: You know, you could take it to lecture and just black stuff down.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's what I wanted to do.
SPEAKER_01: I wonder what one of these costs.
SPEAKER_02: Do you think that node is a one name?
SPEAKER_04: Maybe you should say that was the recording.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: It can work at my computer.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But that worked well having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the powerpoint.
SPEAKER_02: Because I find that the problem with powerpoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it.
SPEAKER_02: It is a bit too late.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and this time also the time and the way to actually preparing them.
SPEAKER_04: The thing flew in, you didn't have the whole pushing thing.
SPEAKER_04: There wasn't time for that.
SPEAKER_04: That's the right, otherwise you would have to do that on the board either.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but I mean already just preparing the slides before the meeting.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, totally.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, that was fairly tight anyway.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, especially with that last minute alteration.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, you can see the brackets.
SPEAKER_04: This is just had to be changed.
SPEAKER_04: And yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: We used to say nice things about Gen.
SPEAKER_04: You know, moving so nicely.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I was satisfied with what we did.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, definitely.
SPEAKER_04: You weren't like it, a dictating reader.
SPEAKER_04: I was always good.
SPEAKER_02: You have to say that because I'm taking the note.
SPEAKER_02: I believe the Roman.
SPEAKER_02: I know you've got the pen.
SPEAKER_04: You want a tag here.
SPEAKER_03: And then the team walker saying, I think it works for it nicely.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, to anyone feel that they were getting covered up and not being able to express them.
SPEAKER_03: I guess it was a fairly small group.
SPEAKER_01: So all of us got to express our opinions.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Well, it's pretty new, pretty novel solution for most control really.
SPEAKER_03: All this flipping open thing.
SPEAKER_03: I didn't know I'd be shopping for my controls.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, and I would never see anything.
SPEAKER_03: And none of my examples was like this.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I'll be looking up next time on Instagram.
SPEAKER_04: I'll be exploring.
SPEAKER_04: I'll see you.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe we could have a patent on this one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Patent, patent.
SPEAKER_04: I think we'd like to think the idea has been evil.
SPEAKER_04: We've got nowhere to find it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Or you can always go to Google and type in the Nana remote control.
SPEAKER_02: The library.
SPEAKER_02: The library.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but that would just come up with like, things with nothing.
SPEAKER_02: True.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So costs are within budget.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Within budget, including one of the got one euro left over bits that we didn't foresee.
SPEAKER_02: We've evaluated the project.
SPEAKER_02: You've got the scores.
SPEAKER_02: Can you put that in the project documents?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, in the project.
SPEAKER_02: I'm already and the process we all didn't really have any major problems.
SPEAKER_02: Were there any, was there anything that you found difficult or anything that didn't go as smooth as?
SPEAKER_03: My mind difficulty was the time pressure otherwise.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, sometimes it was like a little bit less.
SPEAKER_01: I thought that was good though because if you're given too much time, you've got nothing to do with your time.
SPEAKER_01: Although we could have made the R's better had we had playing on the internet.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I think we're still low within a...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we've got that time there.
SPEAKER_02: We've got about five minutes left.
SPEAKER_02: But if we finish, then we're finished.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Which is too efficient.
SPEAKER_02: And we should never drag a meeting on just because we have extra time.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, so I would say that's the end of that meeting.
SPEAKER_02: It was a pleasure working with you.
SPEAKER_02: It was a very productive day.
SPEAKER_04: We could draw animals on the board again.
SPEAKER_01: Oh no.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_03: It can make some animals.
SPEAKER_03: Are you dear mate?
SPEAKER_04: No, it's just me and it smells so bad.
SPEAKER_03: It doesn't?
SPEAKER_03: It smells very sweet.
SPEAKER_02: So we have to complete the final question there, meeting summary when they...
SPEAKER_02: Is there a question there already?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if it's already sent or not.
SPEAKER_04: Do we have to go back into the other room?
SPEAKER_02: I don't see why you can't stay here.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, it's here.
SPEAKER_02: I'll make your animal free.
SPEAKER_03: It was supposed to be pink.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but it was blue.
None: I don't know if it's pink.
None: I don't know if it's pink.
None: I don't know if it's pink.
