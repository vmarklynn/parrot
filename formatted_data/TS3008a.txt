SPEAKER_00: Great.
SPEAKER_00: Thanks.
SPEAKER_00: Welcome to the kickoff meeting.
SPEAKER_00: I forgot to put my name over here.
SPEAKER_00: It's Martin.
SPEAKER_00: So you all know.
SPEAKER_00: What is the agenda for today?
SPEAKER_00: What I'm doing right now.
SPEAKER_00: We're going to do some acquaintance things.
SPEAKER_00: Give some examples of the tool training, project plan discussion, and the closing.
SPEAKER_00: We have 25 minutes.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, the project aim is to design a new remote control.
SPEAKER_00: Some of the objectives are that it has to be original, trendy, and user-friendly.
SPEAKER_00: So now we all know what our goal is.
SPEAKER_00: I forget the acquaintance part, but we all know each other.
SPEAKER_00: We all know each other names.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: You know, I'm tech.
SPEAKER_02: I'm tech.
SPEAKER_00: Am I?
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: I think we already have been to that part.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, it consists of three levels of design.
SPEAKER_00: We begin with a functional design.
SPEAKER_00: And we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design.
SPEAKER_00: Every level of design consists of some individual work.
SPEAKER_00: And we close it with a meeting.
SPEAKER_00: You all receive an email with an example of our explanation of what the particular level of design means to the different functions.
SPEAKER_00: You probably read that already.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: I don't have to tell you about that.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, first we're going to try some different things with the tools.
SPEAKER_00: We have over here.
SPEAKER_00: So you get acquainted with these meeting tools.
SPEAKER_00: We have a smart boards.
SPEAKER_00: There's those two boards.
SPEAKER_00: This is the presentation board, which one I'm using right now.
SPEAKER_00: There's a document folder called Share Document Folder.
SPEAKER_00: You can upload your documents to that folder and then you can open them over here.
SPEAKER_00: So you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen.
SPEAKER_00: We also have the white board.
SPEAKER_00: Can we keep the white board on our left?
SPEAKER_02: No, no, just on the screen over here.
SPEAKER_02: No, I saw a screen file, the smart board.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, well, probably.
SPEAKER_00: But I don't know if the software is on the left or not.
SPEAKER_00: But it's mainly your thing for in the meeting.
SPEAKER_00: So I don't think it's.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if it's important.
SPEAKER_00: This is an explanation of the smart board.
SPEAKER_00: There is a tool bar over here.
SPEAKER_00: It's quite simple.
SPEAKER_00: You have the pen function.
SPEAKER_00: A razor function is like a very simple paint application.
SPEAKER_00: We use the same file during the whole day.
SPEAKER_00: And you can make new sheets by pressing on the blank button.
SPEAKER_00: It works like this.
SPEAKER_00: The pen is selected, yes.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, no, no.
SPEAKER_02: It doesn't have the pen.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_00: What it is, pen.
SPEAKER_00: It's not working like a pen yet.
None: Oh.
SPEAKER_02: It's doing some stuff now.
SPEAKER_00: So you can use a pen.
SPEAKER_00: You can use an eraser.
SPEAKER_00: And you can make new blanks.
SPEAKER_00: And you can change the line width and the color of the pen by pressing on forward.
SPEAKER_00: But you select pen format.
SPEAKER_00: Then select current color or line width.
SPEAKER_00: So it's quite easy.
SPEAKER_00: Well, now you're all quaint with different tools.
SPEAKER_00: We're going to try out the electronic whiteboard.
SPEAKER_00: Every participant should draw its favorite animal and some of its favorite characteristics.
SPEAKER_00: On blank sheet with different colors with different pen widths.
SPEAKER_00: I'll start off then.
SPEAKER_00: I'll use this same sheet.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, I think.
SPEAKER_00: Different colors.
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to draw a piranha.
SPEAKER_00: I see.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to use some different color areas now.
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to draw a little white.
SPEAKER_00: Looks like a fish.
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to draw a little whiteboard.
SPEAKER_00: What's this black?
SPEAKER_02: Yellow.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, this is just useless drawings.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, teeth.
SPEAKER_00: What they're not supposed to be green or different color areas.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: I have some of its favorite characteristics.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I like it's razor sharp teeth.
SPEAKER_00: Plus the big forehead and a small, small, actual face.
SPEAKER_00: And I like its overall aggressive look.
SPEAKER_00: That's what I like about the piranha.
SPEAKER_00: I think that's kind of what the intention should be.
SPEAKER_00: Well, it wants to be next.
SPEAKER_01: Nobody, I guess.
SPEAKER_02: I'll go get it.
SPEAKER_00: I'll make a new sheet by pressing on blank.
SPEAKER_00: Blank?
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Then pen again?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So in the format menu, you can choose the different colors and pen.
SPEAKER_01: Format.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, control.
SPEAKER_02: Purple.
SPEAKER_02: I know what my favorite animal is, but the easiest animal I can think is a bird.
SPEAKER_02: I will.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I thought of that actually.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's a little bit light.
SPEAKER_02: Another color, maybe, a red one.
SPEAKER_02: A little bit more one.
SPEAKER_02: Two, three.
SPEAKER_02: That's another one.
SPEAKER_00: Tell us something about your favorite quick things of these two.
SPEAKER_02: It's simplicity.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's the most simple animal I know.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know, maybe because there's such a free and maybe in the sky or something like that.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe a little bit.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: More a bird?
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_00: We'll get you a point.
SPEAKER_01: It wants to be next.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, whatever.
SPEAKER_01: I'll go next.
SPEAKER_01: Thanks.
SPEAKER_01: I haven't got a favorite animal.
SPEAKER_01: Two-saw dictionary.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: What should I draw?
None: A cow.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: I'll draw a penguin.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I'll draw a penguin, whatever.
SPEAKER_01: I can draw.
SPEAKER_01: So you can start to laugh already.
SPEAKER_01: Well, whatever.
None: Something like that.
SPEAKER_01: Come on.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's a little bit hard.
SPEAKER_01: Orange.
SPEAKER_01: Whatever.
SPEAKER_01: It's better than your bird.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Everything's better than your bird.
SPEAKER_01: True.
SPEAKER_01: Whatever.
SPEAKER_01: Hey, it's blue.
SPEAKER_01: Whatever.
SPEAKER_01: I like its ugliness.
SPEAKER_01: And, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Whatever.
SPEAKER_01: The way it walks or whatever.
SPEAKER_01: Your turn.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Drawing.
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to draw a cat.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know why, but cat is a very smart animal.
SPEAKER_03: And you can have them at home, which is not a suitcase with Bing Wings and...
SPEAKER_00: You can have a piranha, I know.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Or a lion.
SPEAKER_01: I mean a bird.
SPEAKER_02: I'm mess with my bird.
SPEAKER_03: It's not very...
SPEAKER_03: Very good drawn, but...
SPEAKER_02: I can see the cat.
SPEAKER_02: It's almost piranha.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think Darwin would agree with that.
SPEAKER_03: It's arched.
SPEAKER_03: It's nice cat.
SPEAKER_03: He's crying, but...
SPEAKER_03: He's crying because of his ugliness.
SPEAKER_00: What do you like about it then?
SPEAKER_03: Most cats are small.
SPEAKER_03: You can handle them.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: And then we are through the tool training, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: We call it training.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: This is something about the project finance.
SPEAKER_00: The sending price of our remote control is going to be 25 euros.
SPEAKER_00: And our profit aim is 15 million euros.
SPEAKER_00: We're very ambitious on this one.
SPEAKER_00: The market range is international, so it's going to be so worldwide.
SPEAKER_00: And the production costs should be a maximum of 12 euros, 50 per remote control.
SPEAKER_00: That's clear.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah?
SPEAKER_00: All right.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: We're now going to discuss some stuff where we're going to brainstorm about what kind of remote control is going to be.
SPEAKER_00: Tell me about your experiences with remote controls.
SPEAKER_00: Do you have good experiences with remote controls?
SPEAKER_00: Do they annoy you sometimes?
SPEAKER_00: Are they difficult to understand?
SPEAKER_00: Maybe they don't interact with different kind of equipment very well.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls, but if you see elderly people, all these buttons, and then they buy a new TV because their previous one was stolen or whatever.
SPEAKER_01: And then a totally different remote control with different functions on different places and half of the functions are removed or whatever.
SPEAKER_01: So I think what we need is a clear remote control with grouped buttons, you know.
SPEAKER_01: All the buttons which apply to the text functions in one different functions, one area or whatever, not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to minimize it to this, or whatever. Other functions, totally somewhere else. I think we should group them the same for the volume buttons.
SPEAKER_00: Is it going to be a remote control that's what it can be used for different kind of equipment like your TV and your...
SPEAKER_01: Well, I was thinking since TV is mostly used together with a VCR or DVD player or recorder and not with a stereo, I think it should be good to include functions for VCRs and DVD players.
SPEAKER_00: What are the DVD players in home? Cinema sets often, RoboS, stereo, I-Fi sets, probably.
SPEAKER_00: That's what, from my experience.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know how I-Fi set is not often used as I know of in combination with the television.
SPEAKER_01: But we're going to...
SPEAKER_02: It's only for television, I suppose.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, it is only for television?
SPEAKER_02: I thought it was only for television.
SPEAKER_02: So we probably don't have to...
SPEAKER_02: Well, X-Funch is for DVD players.
SPEAKER_01: We're going to break them in.
SPEAKER_01: We're going to break them in.
SPEAKER_01: If we think it's useful, we do it.
SPEAKER_00: Where did you find that?
SPEAKER_02: In the email.
SPEAKER_02: That's right, it's a television, RoboS, control.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
SPEAKER_01: I was thinking since...
SPEAKER_00: In the most television remote control support other functions as well.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, that's what we have to think about it.
SPEAKER_00: But we've got to put some...
SPEAKER_00: So user friendliness is a priority.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I was going to buy it.
SPEAKER_00: I guess...
SPEAKER_00: I need the experts.
SPEAKER_00: Well, this may be some aspect of the...
SPEAKER_00: Or some point at which we can excel by making a very useful...
SPEAKER_00: Well, then your...
SPEAKER_00: Your usability, man.
SPEAKER_00: So this is going to be a very important task for you then.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Well, other IDs, how can we make a trendy or something?
SPEAKER_00: The...
SPEAKER_00: Take a look at it.
SPEAKER_03: Take a look at it.
SPEAKER_00: Go with fashion.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe a can opener underneath it.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: Or something special, like a MPD-repe player inside of it.
SPEAKER_00: Or well done production costs are going to be time.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, wait too long.
SPEAKER_02: I think we have to keep it simple.
SPEAKER_02: To get a whole market.
SPEAKER_02: It's international.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe with different titles.
SPEAKER_00: We have different fronts.
SPEAKER_00: Or we'll have to be something.
SPEAKER_00: And we'll have to be a model of the idea of course.
SPEAKER_00: That's a particular one which makes it...
SPEAKER_00: We can skip back to the goals probably.
SPEAKER_00: Original trendly and user-friendly.
SPEAKER_00: We'll already talk about user-friendlyness.
SPEAKER_00: Well, something trendy and original, well, that goes hand in hand, I guess.
SPEAKER_00: And something is original.
SPEAKER_00: It tends to be trendy, probably, or you should make a combination of that.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So the technical part of the process is something you're going to look after for.
SPEAKER_00: So you have to think about what kind of equipment you want to manage with it.
SPEAKER_00: Well, that's an important part for you then.
SPEAKER_00: What's the important?
SPEAKER_00: Guards to the user-friendly part of it.
SPEAKER_00: Well, you should look out for what makes it trendy.
SPEAKER_00: Well, you know, like some special future or something.
SPEAKER_00: Did it get some gadget-ness or something?
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: What the market wishes.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Well, closing.
SPEAKER_00: The net meeting starts in 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_00: Individual acting.
SPEAKER_00: The industrial designer will work in design.
SPEAKER_00: Of course.
SPEAKER_00: Already set that.
SPEAKER_00: The user interface designer.
SPEAKER_00: Is it user interface?
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: The technical functions design and the marketing expert user requirements, especially, well, this one was already clear to us.
SPEAKER_00: Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know how much time we have left.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, not many, I guess.
SPEAKER_00: We started at 12.
SPEAKER_00: You just got a message.
SPEAKER_01: Oh.
SPEAKER_01: And what does it say?
SPEAKER_01: And it's said.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, five minutes, so we've got four and a half.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I didn't get a message.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: He's the whatever team leader, team leader.
SPEAKER_00: I had a schedule.
SPEAKER_00: He is the whatever.
SPEAKER_00: We close it.
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to make some minutes or take some minutes.
SPEAKER_00: And it's clear you can put the stuff in the project documents, presentations.
SPEAKER_00: You can all.
SPEAKER_01: Project documents is shown on the whiteboard.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: We're all familiar with Microsoft PowerPoint.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: All right.
SPEAKER_00: We're going to write some stuff down and then we're ready.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Well, we can leave already, I guess.
SPEAKER_00: Should we or is it important that we leave it exact?
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
