None: Hey.
None: Hey.
SPEAKER_02: Hey.
SPEAKER_02: Hey.
None: Your screen was also wet.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Right.
None: Oh, I forgot my pen.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, I get the needle.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, no.
None: My screen is small again.
None: I don't know.
None: I love to hear what to do.
None: So, what I can read it like.
None: Hey.
None: My screen is big.
SPEAKER_02: Great man.
SPEAKER_02: Who starts?
SPEAKER_02: Well, I'll start just with another presentation.
SPEAKER_02: So, then we can look at the agenda for this meeting.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I put some new things in the map.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, boy.
SPEAKER_02: This is it.
SPEAKER_02: I know that shortcut.
SPEAKER_02: Well, our functional design meeting, that's the states we're in.
SPEAKER_02: And you're also all three of you have prepared something about it.
SPEAKER_02: Well, we'll just have a look at the notes from the previous meeting.
SPEAKER_02: What we thought we had decided, but then we'll look at the three presentations from you.
SPEAKER_02: I think you prepared for all of that.
SPEAKER_02: We'll look at the new project requirements.
SPEAKER_02: You also have received the meal.
SPEAKER_02: The new project requirements from our bosses.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I've received a meal with some additional requirements.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: And I'll have a look of, well, I think we should show them before your presentations, because it's not really a smart to include some things we can't because of the new requirements.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Well, then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions.
SPEAKER_02: We have to decide it in this meeting.
SPEAKER_02: What our functions will be.
SPEAKER_02: And then we can discuss some more closing.
SPEAKER_01: We have 40 minutes for this.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think so.
SPEAKER_02: Well, the closing, I will not look at that yet.
SPEAKER_02: Now, look at the show that this board.
SPEAKER_02: Well, a notes first meeting.
SPEAKER_02: Now, I gave a presentation.
SPEAKER_02: We've familiarized us with the boards.
SPEAKER_02: And then we discussed some first ideas.
SPEAKER_02: So we said that we have to merge the strong points from our competitors.
SPEAKER_02: And look at their remote controls.
SPEAKER_02: We should make it compatible with our new DVD and other releases we have, our technical releases.
SPEAKER_02: Not too many buttons.
SPEAKER_02: Well, recognizable button in the middle.
SPEAKER_02: Where you do the most important functions with.
SPEAKER_02: And well, they can have two functions because you have a DVD and a television.
SPEAKER_02: The design has to fit the hands, the original, but also be familiar.
SPEAKER_02: It's one of ideas.
SPEAKER_02: It's just 30 minutes ago.
SPEAKER_02: Now it's right.
SPEAKER_02: But I have to do it.
SPEAKER_02: The materials should be hard plastic with rubber from the ties.
SPEAKER_02: And the labeling of the buttons should be indestructible.
SPEAKER_02: It should be easily wiped out.
SPEAKER_02: Well, fronts were the remote just like almost telephones.
SPEAKER_02: And the technical aspect.
SPEAKER_02: And also labeling of the buttons to functions should be universal standards.
SPEAKER_02: Well, that's just some ideas from the first meeting.
SPEAKER_02: And the logical all of it.
SPEAKER_02: Now, the new project requirements, I'll just show them.
SPEAKER_02: I got this mill from our bosses.
SPEAKER_02: Well, teletext goes out.
SPEAKER_02: We will not use teletext.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe I need to sort of fit it.
SPEAKER_02: But not teletext.
SPEAKER_02: It's not my place to disagree, I guess.
SPEAKER_02: The second is a bit sh-pitty.
SPEAKER_02: Because we just said we wanted to include DVD.
SPEAKER_02: And they don't want it.
SPEAKER_02: Because of our time, we have for this project.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, all right.
SPEAKER_02: So that's a shame.
SPEAKER_02: Because especially for the third requirement, we want to reach people under the 30 years.
SPEAKER_02: Because we don't have those customers at this point.
SPEAKER_02: Well, it's a bit pitty.
SPEAKER_02: Because those people want to have one remote control for all those technical devices they can-
SPEAKER_05: Let's not forget about it. It's just time-consuming.
SPEAKER_02: Well, and our corporate image shoots state-run recognizable in our products.
SPEAKER_02: So we have to use maybe a slogan, maybe a color.
SPEAKER_02: And, yeah, well, on our remote controls, the design has to be, well, as we're all already said, actually, familiar.
SPEAKER_02: Not only does the shape, but also our company.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we are a real fashion-more company.
SPEAKER_01: I read it already told that- I didn't know what company we were, but we designed a- Especially trendy stuff.
SPEAKER_01: So it has to be a modern design.
SPEAKER_01: It's important to know when you design things.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: I noted our slogan that we have, our company, that's- We put the fashion in electronics.
SPEAKER_02: No. So maybe that's a slogan we can put somewhere on our remote control or something.
SPEAKER_02: All right, then we're going to have three presentations.
SPEAKER_02: You want the start?
SPEAKER_02: I think I have to start.
SPEAKER_02: I didn't see anything about it.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, no, it's the order now.
SPEAKER_05: Well, then- I do stuff to think which follows mine, because I was a bit in hurry.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, well, where?
SPEAKER_05: I think it's this one, but I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_05: I'm going to start with these points.
SPEAKER_02: I have to- You already opened the PowerPoint.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, this is- Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Well, I'm going to tell you something about the functional requirements.
SPEAKER_05: To start with these points.
SPEAKER_05: Next, you- At first, I tell you something about what people dislike about the current controls, because it's a smart thing to exclude those things.
SPEAKER_05: Furthermore, it's very important what they do like and what they do use.
SPEAKER_05: Then I tell something about the most important issues.
SPEAKER_05: So we have to focus on those three things.
SPEAKER_05: And in the end, I'll show you our target audience or our target product users, customers.
SPEAKER_05: Well, the first findings are that people think most controls are very kind of ugly.
SPEAKER_05: That's 75% of the current users.
SPEAKER_05: They don't like it, so we might think about fronts in that section.
SPEAKER_05: They also say that's about, I thought it was 50%, that more money will be spent on better looking controls.
SPEAKER_05: So it's very important that you design a nice looking control.
SPEAKER_05: The current user uses his machine just about, well, all the time for a few functions.
SPEAKER_05: Almost every user uses the control for just 10% of his capacity.
SPEAKER_05: So it's really important to make the buttons for the common tasks kind of big or kind of flashy.
SPEAKER_05: Furthermore, it's 75% of the user's zeppes a lot.
SPEAKER_05: It might be smart to make a big zapping button or something in the middle, so you can reach it with your thumb.
SPEAKER_05: That's a good way.
SPEAKER_05: A lot of users lose their controls in the living room.
SPEAKER_05: So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television that your control beeps or something that you can find very easily.
SPEAKER_05: I don't know, maybe that's an idea.
SPEAKER_05: The big, I think, 50% of the users lose his control.
SPEAKER_05: It's in the same room.
SPEAKER_02: It's actually loose from the television because it can also be used for other televisions.
SPEAKER_02: So if you deliver a small click on device that you can put on your television that beeps to your remote control and you lose your click on the television.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, but if someone else uses it in another room or something.
SPEAKER_05: It's not a room.
SPEAKER_05: The control is lost in the same room.
SPEAKER_05: So, well, it would be five-seater.
SPEAKER_05: Furthermore, the learning time is a problem.
SPEAKER_05: 34% thinks it's too difficult to learn.
SPEAKER_05: So the learning curve should be very short for the dumb people should be able to use it.
SPEAKER_01: I think our user expert should also consider manual for the remote.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, but people don't read manuals.
SPEAKER_01: Now, they don't read it?
SPEAKER_01: So it is users to add one.
SPEAKER_01: Do you think?
SPEAKER_05: I think you should put more time in the design of pick-up and use.
SPEAKER_04: It's a manual.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, right.
SPEAKER_04: Because they don't use it.
SPEAKER_04: And know how it's supposed to work.
SPEAKER_02: You should always be a manual, but can be very careful.
SPEAKER_04: Nobody reads all the remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe if you don't recognize a button, who do they call?
SPEAKER_04: It should be there, the manual, but not to explain how the remote works.
SPEAKER_05: We don't have much time, so it's better to put our attention to the design so you can pick up and use it.
SPEAKER_02: We are a design team. We can say to some writer, make a manual.
SPEAKER_02: It's part of the...
SPEAKER_01: No, no.
SPEAKER_01: Well, we'll have a look.
SPEAKER_05: Next point.
SPEAKER_05: Yes?
SPEAKER_05: Ericie?
SPEAKER_05: Well, that's about 20% I thought, but the designer should take it to...
SPEAKER_05: Consider the consequences of using your remote.
SPEAKER_05: It should be a good thing in your hand.
SPEAKER_05: Right. This is the most important part.
SPEAKER_05: We're...
SPEAKER_05: Like the requirements said, we're going to specify...
SPEAKER_05: We're going to target a younger audience.
SPEAKER_05: That's about 60% of the market, so it's quite important.
SPEAKER_05: Research shows that they like to have a little LCD screen on their...
SPEAKER_05:...Zapping device.
SPEAKER_05: I thought it was the age between 16 and 20, 99% of the people like that.
SPEAKER_05: So it's very important. We should definitely have that in our designs.
SPEAKER_02: Well, with 12 Euro 50, as production cost, we can't afford to spend the...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, but they think it's really important.
SPEAKER_05: So if we want to... If we make lots of stuff, maybe we can buy it very cheap.
SPEAKER_05: I don't know. We have to...
SPEAKER_01: Well, we'll consider it here.
SPEAKER_02: You're tossing to look into the costs of that...
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if any information on that...
SPEAKER_05: Well, we'll look into that later.
SPEAKER_05: Right.
SPEAKER_05: And another thing is speed recognition.
SPEAKER_05: They also like that, but research is very costly.
SPEAKER_04: So that's difficult to realize also.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah. But it might be important for you to...
SPEAKER_02: We have very demanding clients.
SPEAKER_02: It's not yet a standard development, though, and we have customers...
SPEAKER_04: Well, I do think LCD is more...
SPEAKER_05:...richable than a standard.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, absolutely.
SPEAKER_05: So we might consider LCD screens.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah, all right.
SPEAKER_01: We'll consider both and see what we can find, I think.
SPEAKER_01: We don't rule them out immediately.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: I think that's it.
SPEAKER_05: I think it is sensible to take these points into the notes...
SPEAKER_05: Yes.
SPEAKER_05:...so you can...
SPEAKER_05: Right.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I can still see your presentation.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, right.
SPEAKER_02:...since...
SPEAKER_02: Well, next...
SPEAKER_02: I don't know who is next.
SPEAKER_02: You've got a...
SPEAKER_02: Can I give you a technical talk?
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: I'll give you a little bit of a technical talk.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I just might take to explain...
SPEAKER_01:...of the point out of working design.
SPEAKER_01: Yep.
SPEAKER_01: We have that here.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, how do you large it so that you can have the...
SPEAKER_01: F5.
SPEAKER_03: F5.
SPEAKER_03: Well, the working design...
SPEAKER_01: That's my...
SPEAKER_01:...like button.
SPEAKER_01: Well, all right. You know what I am, and what I do.
SPEAKER_01: We have this. It's a bit unclear because I wanted to copy paste something.
SPEAKER_01: It was originally in black and white, but it became black and...
SPEAKER_01:...per-purple, but...
SPEAKER_01: I think you can read it.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I think it's important for you to realize the basic function of a remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Well, you can see...
SPEAKER_05: Maybe you can select it.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, yes, really?
SPEAKER_05: In first.
SPEAKER_01: And I don't...
SPEAKER_01: I can select on the...
SPEAKER_01: The next picture.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_01: Well, you can read it. It's not the difficult.
SPEAKER_01: This is a schematic view of how a basic remote control works.
SPEAKER_01: You have the energy, the power of the...
SPEAKER_01:...mode control and the sender, which is the LED.
SPEAKER_01: The bulb that sends the infrared beam to the...
SPEAKER_01:...now, to the sender.
SPEAKER_01: And the source is, of course, the user.
SPEAKER_01: The user interface is...
SPEAKER_01:...the buttons, of course.
SPEAKER_01: And the user interface sends...
SPEAKER_01:...the different signals of the different buttons to the chip.
SPEAKER_01: The chip sends it to the LED.
SPEAKER_01: And the LED sends it to receive it.
SPEAKER_01: That's the basic idea. Very basic.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I have...
SPEAKER_01:...put it in a couple of basic steps.
SPEAKER_01: The remote is basically just waiting for a user to press a key.
SPEAKER_01: It does nothing until, of course, the key is pressed.
SPEAKER_01: The key press is the signal to a chip.
SPEAKER_01: The chip sends it to the connection and recognizes the key.
SPEAKER_01: So, well, you understand.
SPEAKER_01: The chip produces more code, a specific code, to indicate that specific button, that is pressed, of course.
SPEAKER_01: And it uses transistors in the remote control...
SPEAKER_01:...to amplify and to send that signal, again, to the LED, which is the bulb, of course.
SPEAKER_01: And the LED produces an infrared beam, and signals the...
SPEAKER_01:...well, it's very simple.
SPEAKER_01: And signals to the sensor on the TV set, and the TV set also recognizes the signal...
SPEAKER_01:...and performs the assigned task.
SPEAKER_02: So, this is also why we have to have a button that says, I'm now busy with a DVD if we had done that.
SPEAKER_02: And the button...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but we don't have any.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, exactly.
SPEAKER_01: Well, this is the basic function of a remote.
SPEAKER_01: I have some couple of pictures here.
SPEAKER_01: It's a very basic one.
SPEAKER_01: And this corp is, if you're going to add an LCD screen to it, it won't look anything like this.
SPEAKER_01: But this is very basic, basically, the shape of a remote control...
SPEAKER_01:...it has very little buttons.
SPEAKER_01: But it's quite...
SPEAKER_01: You can easily recognize the buttons.
SPEAKER_01: They are far enough apart and anything.
SPEAKER_01: It's not very high-tech indeed, and it's not very user-friendly, if you look at the shape.
SPEAKER_01: It's just a simple long box shape.
SPEAKER_01: So, we have to change a little bit to that.
SPEAKER_01: So, that comes more user-friendly, and that problems like air-Z.
SPEAKER_01: Don't talk to me.
SPEAKER_05: I have a table here about the relevance of the buttons.
SPEAKER_05: The power button is used very much.
SPEAKER_05: Channel selection, volume, and tail-tech.
SPEAKER_05: Well, tail-tech is not an option.
SPEAKER_05: But I think it's very important to make the power channel and volume buttons near to the thumb, so you can't have air-Z consequences.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, because they are the most important buttons.
SPEAKER_05: And you can immediately make them easy to press.
SPEAKER_03: Well, you don't have to look and search for them.
SPEAKER_02: If you have the most used buttons all in one place, and you keep making the same...
SPEAKER_02: Well, move right.
SPEAKER_02: But if you would put it at a different place, then you have to move your hands.
SPEAKER_02: And that's one of the things about RZ.
SPEAKER_05: That's right.
SPEAKER_05: You can't have any...
SPEAKER_01: Every button under the thumb, of course.
SPEAKER_02: The most important buttons, maybe you can just put them a bit apart, so you would...
SPEAKER_02: That's very important.
SPEAKER_02: And reject RZ.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe you can make for channel changing too little buttons on the side of the remote, so you can just do like this.
SPEAKER_04: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: I saw that on mobile phones, they also have the other things.
SPEAKER_05: They are the most usable.
SPEAKER_05: Do people, when they pick up a remote, know that they have to do that?
SPEAKER_05: It's a new feature.
SPEAKER_05: You can make a double feature like a button on the top and...
SPEAKER_05: Well, also, if someone puts a...
SPEAKER_02: I'm down there, the remote...
SPEAKER_04: It's missing.
SPEAKER_04: I think it is sent with.
SPEAKER_02: If someone puts up his remote and he touches the side, and he's over there on the next channel, that's very irritating.
SPEAKER_02: That's right.
SPEAKER_02: I think...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, but...
SPEAKER_05: Right.
SPEAKER_01: In any case, the basic function should be indeed, and as you say, at the thumb, I think that's a good idea.
SPEAKER_01: And the less important buttons, like the different channels, the numbers, one to three, four, five, and so it should be...
SPEAKER_01: Well, not in reach, because they don't use it all this time.
SPEAKER_01: Well, it's pretty, pretty...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, basically, as you said, and as from pictures of the inside, working, but I don't want to get too technical, because that's not very useful for you or part of the job.
SPEAKER_01: So, yeah, you know, this is how it looked from the inside.
SPEAKER_01: And, well, that's about it, I think.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah, I still like this.
SPEAKER_01: I had to delete this, but I had to make a schematic of...
SPEAKER_01: I had to do a little time, but don't...
SPEAKER_01: Don't look at this, please.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's clear.
SPEAKER_02: We understand how it works.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: That's the most important thing.
SPEAKER_02: Nice.
SPEAKER_02: Then, Mike can give the third presentation.
SPEAKER_02: Right, latest, did we start this presentation?
SPEAKER_05: I think about 20 minutes ago.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: You do time, you do.
SPEAKER_02: Then we have still the time.
SPEAKER_02: But we do have to come to a decision.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, right.
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_02: That's great, ever.
SPEAKER_04: Well, I thought everybody on the website would see the same thing, but...
SPEAKER_04: Obviously, that's not the case.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, there are different...
SPEAKER_01: We all have different home pages.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Different links, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: For instance, you couldn't see this.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, yeah, well...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Well, I am my younger, usually in phases, aren't it?
SPEAKER_04: The method, well...
SPEAKER_04: I use my own experience with remotes to the good look...
SPEAKER_04: The remotes on the corporate website, which are these two.
SPEAKER_04: These are already used.
SPEAKER_04: Yes, these are from another manufacturer.
SPEAKER_04: All right.
SPEAKER_04: This one is engineering centered, so this one has the most functions on things.
SPEAKER_04: This one is user centered.
SPEAKER_04: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I like user centered.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I like user centered centered.
SPEAKER_04: Also the best.
SPEAKER_04: We also.
SPEAKER_04: Well, I thought that we used the option to control the DVD also, and tailor text and that kind of stuff.
SPEAKER_04: So I thought we would use more or need more buttons than this one.
SPEAKER_04: But we have to re-check that because it's required.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: That's why this is not relevant anymore.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we'll need.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, right.
SPEAKER_04: I kind of like the shape.
SPEAKER_04: I think this is what we talked about.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think you can't really see it from different sides, but I think...
SPEAKER_01: No, I...
SPEAKER_04: Oh, I see.
SPEAKER_04: You can draw it a few...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I think we should go further with the idea of removable fronts.
SPEAKER_04: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_04: So you can...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, customize the...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, excuse me, but they all have to have something about the recognition from our company.
SPEAKER_02: So we cannot just...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, make someone...
SPEAKER_04: No, that's not the whole remote that changes.
SPEAKER_04: No, but...
SPEAKER_02: The side they look at is the front.
SPEAKER_02: So if you make a front with just a tie you're on it, then our recognition is totally gone.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's right.
SPEAKER_04: Now you can put same symbol on every remote.
SPEAKER_03: That's the most...
SPEAKER_03: Like everything that comes to the back side.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Well, and...
SPEAKER_04: Something like this.
SPEAKER_04: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: It's recognizable.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: We can make a symbol of the company right here and a few with the front on it, there's a hole in the front.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so that...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, don't replace the symbol, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Or the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But there's no focus on the front.
SPEAKER_04: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Well, so like I said, I thought we'd use more functions.
SPEAKER_04: We had to include more functions, but we don't.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need, maybe some less.
SPEAKER_04: Like eject, we don't need some other buttons we don't need.
SPEAKER_01: Mike, can you put that picture for me in the work document file?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I will.
SPEAKER_04: I think for the remote, less is more.
SPEAKER_04: Less buttons, the better the design.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: We should grow with that concept, I think.
SPEAKER_05: Right.
SPEAKER_05: I've got another point.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: There are two target audience, and we've chose for the younger one.
SPEAKER_05: Research has shown that it's a high interested in features.
SPEAKER_05: They are high interested in features, but they are more critical.
SPEAKER_05: For a critical.
SPEAKER_05: The younger audience.
SPEAKER_05: So we must design a control that really speaks to people.
SPEAKER_02: Well, what if we, I at home have a remote that has the most familiar buttons on the top, and the bottom side of the front has a little clap.
SPEAKER_02: You can click away, and then you have much more functions that most people don't use, but some do.
SPEAKER_01: But I think the most functions underneath that.
SPEAKER_01: Clip, aren't as much.
SPEAKER_02: Well, but they usually, their features are important.
SPEAKER_02: They want to.
SPEAKER_04: But not.
SPEAKER_04: But what kind of features?
SPEAKER_04: I think these screens are more traditional.
SPEAKER_04: But most look at the numbers.
SPEAKER_05: The new features are, like I said, LCD and speech control.
SPEAKER_05: Our audience, these people, are very like these features.
SPEAKER_05: So we must build in something, or they will go to the concurrent.
SPEAKER_05: Our competitors.
SPEAKER_05: Right.
SPEAKER_05: So I do think we have to have some features.
SPEAKER_05: Even though they cost a little more.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe we could.
SPEAKER_02: For some calculators, you have those little LCD, that you can click on or something, or you can click out of the remote.
SPEAKER_02: And if that gives you a little bit of set of information.
SPEAKER_02: Like a group of.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Which program you are watching or something.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Those kind of things.
SPEAKER_02: Because you also have those program recognition for your PCRs.
SPEAKER_02: And, yeah, right.
SPEAKER_02: Well, if your remote picks that up also, they can display which program you're currently watching.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So it just signals the different.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, different symbols on the screen, because if you change to channel two, you have two on the screen and two on your.
SPEAKER_01: For example, on your LCD screen.
SPEAKER_02: It could be such a little that you can click in and out.
SPEAKER_02: And you have it.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, we should keep that simple too.
SPEAKER_01: But should it really be clickable?
SPEAKER_01: No, maybe.
SPEAKER_01: No, it's going to be integrated.
SPEAKER_01: Just integrate in design to make it more.
SPEAKER_05: More 20.
SPEAKER_05: You said like this, you can watch.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, something like some radios in car.
SPEAKER_04: Where it's walking.
SPEAKER_04: Are they here?
SPEAKER_05: They're coming by there.
SPEAKER_01: Well, that's of course a bit more expensive than the basic calculated design.
SPEAKER_01: But the scrolling text and that kind of thing.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I think it's just scripted.
SPEAKER_02: It keeps it rolling.
SPEAKER_02: And it's not that it's five minutes of implementing time.
SPEAKER_02: Five minutes.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, yeah, for programming.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, so I don't think that's the issue.
SPEAKER_05: No.
SPEAKER_05: All right.
SPEAKER_05: All right.
SPEAKER_02: We go with the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I think so, yes.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, well, we still need to know how much that will cost.
SPEAKER_04: Right?
SPEAKER_05: I don't know if I can find that.
SPEAKER_04: No, but maybe you'll get that information.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, right.
SPEAKER_02: We can use this board again, I think.
SPEAKER_02: We can put some decisions about the controls we want, the issue.
SPEAKER_02: Where's my presentation?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, understand.
SPEAKER_05: We should have a general idea of how it's going to look.
SPEAKER_02: Well, we're here now, I think.
SPEAKER_02: I've already given you.
SPEAKER_02: So we have to decide on the different remote control functions.
SPEAKER_02: So we want to have a small LCD screen.
SPEAKER_01: Should we start with the most important part?
SPEAKER_01: LCD screen at the bottom.
SPEAKER_01: All right, but we should start with the power button.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: How do you set?
SPEAKER_05: You just sit in your chair.
SPEAKER_00: Huh?
SPEAKER_04: We're going to be able to do the LCD screen on top of it.
SPEAKER_04: It's a little bit terrible.
SPEAKER_04: The natural, because most of the remote has some space left at the bottom.
SPEAKER_05: But that's where your handphone might be.
SPEAKER_05: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: And then we should centralize the discussion here.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what to do.
SPEAKER_01: No, I'm not.
SPEAKER_05: We're busy with something.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, right.
SPEAKER_05: Do you think it's better to put the LCD at the bottom?
SPEAKER_05: And I think it's better at the top.
SPEAKER_01: Why do you think it's better at the bottom?
SPEAKER_04: Well, because most remote have some space left at the bottom.
SPEAKER_04: And that way you can keep the shape recognizable for it.
SPEAKER_04: It's really.
SPEAKER_01: But you just can put the whole interface a bit down.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: And for the integration, that's actually like small.
SPEAKER_05: It's wide.
SPEAKER_05: It's not high.
SPEAKER_05: Well, Mike has a point.
SPEAKER_02: Because when I use a remote, I hate the buttons at the bottom.
SPEAKER_02: Bottom.
SPEAKER_02: So, and I like to use the ones.
SPEAKER_02: On the top.
SPEAKER_02: So when I have to.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I agree with you.
SPEAKER_01: With few functions, you know, it's also more recognizable.
SPEAKER_01: It looks more like a calculator to people if you have the.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, but we don't want that.
SPEAKER_02: You don't want them to look like a calculator.
SPEAKER_02: You want to look at.
SPEAKER_02: Like hour.
SPEAKER_02: Original.
SPEAKER_01: Well, you don't have to throw an important aspect.
SPEAKER_01: Like familiarity.
SPEAKER_01: Completely away.
SPEAKER_01: Because I think it's a.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's still important to have it at the top.
SPEAKER_02: Because it's more familiar.
SPEAKER_05: That's more familiar.
SPEAKER_01: That's the problem.
SPEAKER_05: When I draw here.
SPEAKER_05: It's a bit off.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's a little bit.
SPEAKER_02: It needs to be calibration.
SPEAKER_02: No, let's talk about that later.
SPEAKER_02: You shoot another pen.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe that's better.
SPEAKER_01: Where?
SPEAKER_01: Now, now, now, now, you only have one.
SPEAKER_05: Especially that screen.
SPEAKER_05: Right, we have to make a decision now.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
None: We don't have much time.
SPEAKER_05: No.
SPEAKER_05: I think we have a few functions and we can put the LSD above it.
SPEAKER_05: I still have lots of room at the bottom.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you can put it right.
SPEAKER_02: I think it should be at the bottom.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I'm the.
SPEAKER_02: I'm the.
SPEAKER_04: The last.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: I thought we were.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: We're two with VS 2.
SPEAKER_02: Well, but what if we.
SPEAKER_02: We first decide the different functions.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And then look at the design.
SPEAKER_01: We were busy with that.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we shoot some on the.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The different aspects of the thing.
SPEAKER_01: So we have the power button.
SPEAKER_05: More of, I think that you two should be.
SPEAKER_05: Come to consensus about the LSD.
SPEAKER_05: Yes.
SPEAKER_05: Your.
SPEAKER_05: Your job.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, of course, yeah, it's.
SPEAKER_03: Well, we have a power button.
SPEAKER_01: Guys, you have to agree.
SPEAKER_01: I can say, von, it's like this.
SPEAKER_01: I agree.
SPEAKER_01: We have a power button.
SPEAKER_02: Seven buttons.
SPEAKER_02: LSD window.
SPEAKER_02: The number buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Channel.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Volume.
SPEAKER_01: Volume control.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, let's look at your.
SPEAKER_02: The mute button.
SPEAKER_02: I love that one.
SPEAKER_04: Uh-huh.
SPEAKER_04: I think we should use something like this.
SPEAKER_04: To.
SPEAKER_04: The channel up and channel down button.
SPEAKER_04: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, in circle, you know.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Well, that's also designed.
SPEAKER_04: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Next.
SPEAKER_01: Well, on this remote, these controls are for something else.
SPEAKER_04: Or do you think they were something else?
SPEAKER_04: They are for some.
SPEAKER_04: Drop some of these buttons.
SPEAKER_05: You should.
SPEAKER_05: Put that power button channel.
SPEAKER_05: And volume should have the most.
SPEAKER_05: Importance.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I think this should be in one big circle in the middle.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, but what he said about the RZ was kind of true.
SPEAKER_05: When you put them all in the same place, the most used buttons, you're doing the same thing all the time.
SPEAKER_05: And that's just what RZ is all about.
SPEAKER_05: So it might be smarter to put them a little more parts away from each other.
SPEAKER_02: So people have to move their hands.
SPEAKER_02: And they get less complaints of RZ.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one end.
SPEAKER_01: That's what I always do because all my important buttons are going to stay in place from time to time.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: But people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place.
SPEAKER_01: No, but they have to be sent.
SPEAKER_01: Would we have to choose frequency with button use?
SPEAKER_05: Yes.
SPEAKER_05: The most used channels are most used within the hour.
SPEAKER_05: So the channel buttons should be far apart.
SPEAKER_05: I think open down.
SPEAKER_05: Open down.
SPEAKER_05: Far apart from each other.
SPEAKER_05: You're thinking about RZ.
SPEAKER_05: Well, not too much.
SPEAKER_04: But the other two frustrations are far more important.
SPEAKER_01: I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together.
SPEAKER_01: But you don't have to have volume control.
SPEAKER_01: For example, the power button.
SPEAKER_04: You can use four times.
SPEAKER_02: If someone is constantly zapping, it's not going to miss that the power button is not right beside.
SPEAKER_02: Because I have another one.
SPEAKER_02: That one can be put away.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: The power button should be left at the top.
SPEAKER_02: It should be left.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, man, five minutes.
SPEAKER_05: Well, five minutes left.
SPEAKER_05: Just make some decisions.
SPEAKER_05: The most important things we have to...
SPEAKER_02: How are we going to do it with those buttons?
SPEAKER_01: We can use the drawing board now.
SPEAKER_01: I think it doesn't work well.
SPEAKER_01: It's pretty nice if we could draw a simple thing.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, well, it's going to take too much time.
SPEAKER_05: You decide that.
SPEAKER_05: You decide that.
SPEAKER_05: Yes.
SPEAKER_05: All right.
SPEAKER_02: Well, the LCD.
SPEAKER_02: You are industrial.
SPEAKER_02: You are user interface.
SPEAKER_02: So I think it's going to go to Mike.
SPEAKER_02: But you will have to make consensus with Tyson.
SPEAKER_04: Well, consensus.
SPEAKER_02: It's a bit hard because we are going to be individually.
SPEAKER_02: We are deciding now.
SPEAKER_05: Top of the problem.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I still think it's quite important.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, it is.
SPEAKER_01: At the top, so you say familiarity is important.
SPEAKER_02: Well, what if we are going to now decide about the functions and the design comes into the next round?
SPEAKER_02: The design round is still to come.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: So, we agreed we do have LCDs.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: That's all right.
SPEAKER_02: The number thing.
SPEAKER_02: That's enough.
SPEAKER_02: Are we going to do it like on Mike's screen with one button that says I'm going to do a two-number digital?
SPEAKER_04: No.
SPEAKER_02: How do you want it to do then?
SPEAKER_02: There's one to three or five of you.
SPEAKER_02: It has to recognize one as it can still come more.
SPEAKER_04: No, if you almost TVs, if you press two numbers, shortly after each other.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, it recognizes that.
SPEAKER_03: So, no button for that.
SPEAKER_03: That's very easy.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Anyone, anyone, on other functionalities of our remote?
SPEAKER_01: I think these are the most important things.
SPEAKER_05: You still have the pictures over there?
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
None: So.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, that's right.
SPEAKER_05: You do need a milk or a different, no.
SPEAKER_05: Like this one.
SPEAKER_05: You do that.
SPEAKER_05: No, we did just chat.
SPEAKER_02: We didn't do.
SPEAKER_05: Are we?
SPEAKER_05: All right.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: No, okay.
SPEAKER_02: Well, because we can integrate with any other remotes, all those buttons on those pictures are irrelevant.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: So, just for a television, is the door we need?
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: It's most usable this way.
SPEAKER_01: So, it's very, very, very, very function.
SPEAKER_02: Data text is gone.
SPEAKER_02: So, all those buttons that are to do with data text, oh, screen placing.
SPEAKER_02: You have those buttons about, and there's two important ones we're forgetting.
SPEAKER_02: There's a screen.
SPEAKER_02: You can make it wider and less wide.
SPEAKER_02: And the button that you can go to, ah, for your video.
SPEAKER_05: Right.
SPEAKER_05: I don't think we have to put that underneath the clip.
SPEAKER_03: Those two, or just two?
SPEAKER_01: Just two under under it.
SPEAKER_01: That's a bit waste.
SPEAKER_04: We can make a little row of like four buttons down here.
SPEAKER_04: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Or, I think, at the top.
SPEAKER_03: Your LSDscar is going to go.
SPEAKER_01: You can put two or three buttons under another section.
SPEAKER_01: That's too complicated.
SPEAKER_01: You can just put it somewhere.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, they aren't used much, not as much as those others.
SPEAKER_01: So, you can put it somewhere.
SPEAKER_01: They're smaller.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's a bit smaller.
SPEAKER_01: And, well, and I think more at the bottom.
None: Yeah, or at the top.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: What do you think, ah, those buttons?
SPEAKER_02: Well, I think that should, in an isolated part, the remote.
SPEAKER_01: And where?
SPEAKER_01: Or, ah, we designed it later.
SPEAKER_01: We have it.
SPEAKER_01: And we designed later where everything goes.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Well, and the other, ah, well, if you, why don't those video, if you, go to video, let's always on your remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but to have the, ah, the video channel.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, you can set to the video channel from zero.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: No, no, not always.
SPEAKER_01: Not a zero remote.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, zero is a different channel than, ah, the video channel.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, but when you set down zero, you get too happy.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I don't.
SPEAKER_02: I go to 99.
SPEAKER_02: Then you press 99.
SPEAKER_04: I think go to video is.
SPEAKER_04: That's the button.
SPEAKER_01: But it's easy to go.
SPEAKER_01: If you are at a channel 55 and you want to, ah, go immediately to the video channel, you do, you have to push to get to zero.
SPEAKER_01: Now, you can be low zero.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: More easy to get to, ah, with the specific, ah,
SPEAKER_02: the video channel. I use it.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, but if you're choosing to incorporate these buttons, you have to have a channel setting.
SPEAKER_05: If you want, if you have a new TV, you have to set the channels.
SPEAKER_05: All these different buttons, you have to.
SPEAKER_02: Even if I don't have buttons for channels, I think, especially on my remote.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, well, it's different screen settings.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, plus and down.
SPEAKER_04: You have one button from set frequency or something.
SPEAKER_04: And then with plus and minus, you can adjust the, ah,
SPEAKER_05: that's the only one we put in there. Shall we show, ah, one for, for a screen, ah, for, ah, channel setting?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, to, ah, yeah, of course, to configure the program.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, no, K button.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, you always have in the center, an okay button.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, for your menu.
SPEAKER_02: Menu button.
SPEAKER_01: You should, yeah, I think that's important.
SPEAKER_01: Uh, channel setting menu.
SPEAKER_01: And then the settings to change the brightness.
SPEAKER_01: The settings to change the brightness and the contrast.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Channel, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So, ah, chief.
SPEAKER_03: Chief.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, say, the menu button is also important.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I have to put it in.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I don't see it.
SPEAKER_01: Here.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, menu, all right.
SPEAKER_04: It's like a contrast and brightness should be in the menu.
SPEAKER_01: In the menu, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And you can then adjust it with the Japanese buttons or something.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the settings buttons are juxtaposed.
SPEAKER_02: If you are in the menu, guys, we're going to, ah, rooms and, ah, we'll have to decide things on our own, I think.
SPEAKER_02: Great.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, chief.
SPEAKER_05: All right.
SPEAKER_05: Well, see you.
SPEAKER_02: We have lunchtime, by the way.
SPEAKER_02: Now, ah, so, ah, I'm hungry.
SPEAKER_01: Lunch.
SPEAKER_05: You had to do my belly.
SPEAKER_02: Ah, we didn't exactly do everything, man.
SPEAKER_02: And we're going to pause and stick, in to it, right?
SPEAKER_04: See you later, right?
SPEAKER_02: So, I must have done something close and close.
SPEAKER_02: I've done the closing, eh?
SPEAKER_02: I must have done something close and close.
None: I've done something close.
SPEAKER_02: I've done something close and close and close.
SPEAKER_02: followed by this modern
None: car version in
