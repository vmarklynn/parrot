SPEAKER_00: Good morning.
SPEAKER_00: Good morning.
SPEAKER_00: I see you all find your places.
SPEAKER_00: Everybody's sitting on the right place.
SPEAKER_00: Let's see.
SPEAKER_00: First I'll introduce myself.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know if everybody knows me.
SPEAKER_00: I'm Bart.
SPEAKER_00: Hello.
SPEAKER_00: Hello.
SPEAKER_00: Bart.
SPEAKER_00: Hello.
SPEAKER_00: Hello.
SPEAKER_00: Hello.
None: Bart.
SPEAKER_00: Welcome.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Let's see.
SPEAKER_00: Let's start off with a little presentation.
SPEAKER_00: First I'll tell you a little bit about the setting.
SPEAKER_00: You can see the few cameras here.
SPEAKER_00: They'll record our actions.
SPEAKER_00: And you all have wires and microphones.
SPEAKER_00: They will record your voice.
SPEAKER_00: There are also some microphones there.
SPEAKER_00: But you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those, because it will disappear when you don't intend to do it.
SPEAKER_00: So this is our project documents folder.
SPEAKER_00: There are some notes you need already.
SPEAKER_00: I see some documents.
SPEAKER_00: I'll start with the presentation kickoff.
SPEAKER_00: It's a great experience.
SPEAKER_00: It's been modified by the administrator.
SPEAKER_00: Let's do it read only.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I don't know if you've noticed, but we are working for real reaction.
SPEAKER_00: It's a company in electronics.
SPEAKER_00: We put fashion in electronics.
SPEAKER_00: We make it work.
SPEAKER_00: in Bartbaute and Project Manager.
SPEAKER_00: So I'll direct you through the project.
SPEAKER_00: This is our agenda.
SPEAKER_00: We have our opening acquaintance tool training project plan discussion closing.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe I can sit down.
SPEAKER_00: Then I can take some notes or let's see.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while.
SPEAKER_00: Sure.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: It's not a lot of work.
SPEAKER_00: If you hear something, you can write down.
SPEAKER_00: Just write it down.
SPEAKER_00: As you can see, it's the opening acquaintance tool training acquaintance.
SPEAKER_00: This is a point we've done a bit.
SPEAKER_00: Have you all seen the corporate website already?
SPEAKER_00: Have you seen any flaws in it?
SPEAKER_00: I think I found one.
SPEAKER_01: Can't say I paid much attention to it, but.
SPEAKER_00: I can see if it works.
SPEAKER_00: This one.
SPEAKER_00: No, it doesn't work here.
SPEAKER_00: OK, no problem.
SPEAKER_00: But on the corporate information side, there was real remote instead of real reaction.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Real remote is not really the company we are, but it's just a little.
SPEAKER_00: Beautiful.
SPEAKER_00: OK, what are we going to do?
SPEAKER_00: Our project aim is, as you can see, a new remote control.
SPEAKER_00: It has to be original, trendy, and user-friendly.
SPEAKER_00: So these are the points where we also hired you.
SPEAKER_00: We've got the marketing expert for the trendy and user-friendly look and industrial designer.
SPEAKER_00: That's also user-friendly and a bit original.
SPEAKER_00: And we've got our user interface designer.
SPEAKER_00: So that's about the new remote control.
SPEAKER_00: Project method is there are three phases we're going through.
SPEAKER_00: First is functional design, individual work meetings.
SPEAKER_00: After the functional design, then the conceptual design and the detailed design, I had some real indications on here.
SPEAKER_00: But I think you know it already by yourself.
SPEAKER_00: Industrial designer is going to work on the working design, components design, and a bit of the look and feel design.
SPEAKER_00: The user interface designer is going to do the technical function design, user interface concept, and user interface design.
SPEAKER_00: And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirements, specification, trend-watching, and project-evaluation.
SPEAKER_00: So that's a bit what you're going to do.
SPEAKER_00: But that will be all worked out in other meetings.
SPEAKER_00: Then we've got our first tool training.
SPEAKER_00: We're going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here.
SPEAKER_00: So it's handy if we have a little bit of training first.
SPEAKER_00: As you can see, we've got the smart boards here and here and the white boards.
SPEAKER_00: In the white board here, there's a little toolbar on this side.
SPEAKER_00: Here are some functions we can save.
SPEAKER_00: These functions we don't have anything to do with.
SPEAKER_00: Only undo you can do a little piece of drawing.
SPEAKER_00: A blank new document for each person.
SPEAKER_00: Select a pen, razor, capture, redone, that's to do anything with.
SPEAKER_00: Then we've got our pen, this pen.
SPEAKER_00: It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page.
SPEAKER_00: In the, I think it is formal.
SPEAKER_00: You can also select the current color and the line with.
SPEAKER_00: With that first, you have to select the pen function.
SPEAKER_00: We're going to work with it in a minute.
SPEAKER_00: So, okay.
SPEAKER_00: That's very simple and it's easy to draw your findings and drawings on there.
SPEAKER_00: Then, a short thing about documents.
SPEAKER_00: We've got our shared folder, project, project documents, I think.
SPEAKER_00: But all you all found that already because there are a lot of documents you need already, so that will be okay.
SPEAKER_00: These are available on the smart boards as well.
SPEAKER_00: So, if you have a document you want to show, just open it from the folder.
SPEAKER_00: Here is the simple toolbar.
SPEAKER_00: It's what I just said.
SPEAKER_00: It's safe, print, move back or forward, one page.
SPEAKER_00: You can switch between the different drawings.
SPEAKER_00: And then we're going to try out the whiteboard.
SPEAKER_00: So, as you can see, we go to draw an animal just to get a bit familiar with it.
SPEAKER_00: I was supposed to run away.
SPEAKER_00: Is everybody playing with the mouse?
SPEAKER_00: Okay. We're going to draw an animal.
SPEAKER_00: And just sum up a few of its favorite characteristics.
SPEAKER_00: The only thing we have to look after is that we use different colors and different lines with this.
SPEAKER_00: I can start from now.
SPEAKER_00: You can use this pen by holding it like a little child because if you hold it like this, the sensors will get blocked and the drawing won't get good.
SPEAKER_00: Another thing is you have to be a bit slow because if you're going to draw it really fast, then the pen won't hold up.
SPEAKER_00: So, we choose Format, current color.
SPEAKER_00: I think gray is appropriate.
SPEAKER_00: Then the line width.
SPEAKER_00: I think 7 will be nice.
SPEAKER_00: Now you will see my drawing capabilities.
SPEAKER_00: There's another very much.
SPEAKER_00: Here I have to do it real slow.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, listen.
SPEAKER_01: Shark.
SPEAKER_00: I'm trying to draw a dolphin.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's not as stupid as it is.
SPEAKER_01: I'm thinking about a short fish.
SPEAKER_00: It's a bit of a short fish.
SPEAKER_00: Now we've got another function.
SPEAKER_00: We've got the eraser.
SPEAKER_00: And then you can do this easily.
SPEAKER_00: I've got to write down a few of his characteristics.
SPEAKER_00: You've got no text tool.
SPEAKER_00: No.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: This is typically a do-action, I think.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe I have to hold it a bit upside down.
SPEAKER_00: I think that's it because if you are going to do it like this, then it will be a stripe.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: Just trying.
SPEAKER_00: This is not my work.
None: Maybe I have to use it.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's wants to draw another animal.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's going to be a little bit more difficult to draw a dolphin.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's going to be a little bit more difficult to draw a dolphin.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's going to be a little bit more difficult to draw a dolphin.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's going to be a little bit more difficult to draw a dolphin.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not much an artist, but here we go.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe it's easier to draw a smaller line with, I think.
SPEAKER_00: I think it's going a lot better than I did.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's going to be a little bit more difficult to draw a dolphin.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's going to be a little bit more difficult to draw a dolphin.
SPEAKER_00: It's nice.
SPEAKER_01: Of course.
SPEAKER_01: It's a real dead sheep.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe you can also write your name somewhere.
SPEAKER_01: Let's go really slow when you're writing.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: They're brilliant animals, and that's just a little me thing.
SPEAKER_01: I guess I'll pass the pen to her.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: It's using the face design.
SPEAKER_01: I'm just going to draw its head.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Sweet.
SPEAKER_01: You know what that is?
SPEAKER_00: Garfield.
SPEAKER_00: Garfield.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I was going to draw a cat too, so I'll just try something else.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Something different than Garfield.
SPEAKER_01: Mine is a bit more skinny.
SPEAKER_01: But what about the most interesting tool?
SPEAKER_00: Is it your cat or did you find him on the street?
SPEAKER_01: Well, it's supposed to be a cat.
SPEAKER_01: I like cats because they are right.
SPEAKER_01: They are right.
SPEAKER_01: They are right.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: That's pretty clear.
SPEAKER_00: So everybody knows how to work with the wideboard now.
SPEAKER_00: So if you have any ideas or if you want to draw anything on the wideboard, just ask and go ahead.
SPEAKER_00: It's pretty easy.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: We're being honed.
SPEAKER_00: So we've got the tool introduction.
SPEAKER_00: We move along to the project finance.
SPEAKER_00: As you can see, for remote control, a selling price is 25 euros.
SPEAKER_00: Our selling price.
SPEAKER_00: Our profit aim is 50 million euros.
SPEAKER_00: That's the least we have to get from our remote controls.
SPEAKER_00: So we have to work together to reach our aims.
SPEAKER_00: We can do it international.
SPEAKER_00: So we have to focus on different kind of users, different kind of cultures, and different kind of trends as well.
SPEAKER_00: But that's all in the later stadium.
SPEAKER_00: Our production cost can be maximal 12.5 euros.
SPEAKER_00: So that's also a point we have to keep in mind that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside and stuff like that.
SPEAKER_00: Point work.
SPEAKER_00: So just try to remember these points.
SPEAKER_00: The selling price is 25 profit aims, 50 million, but more important is the international market we're trying to focus on.
SPEAKER_00: And production cost, maximal 12.5 euros.
SPEAKER_00: So that leads us to our little discussion.
SPEAKER_00: We've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion.
SPEAKER_00: So I'm going to sit down and think.
SPEAKER_00: It's easier.
SPEAKER_00: I've got a message.
SPEAKER_00: Five minutes.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. That's a good timing.
SPEAKER_01: So just on the side note, why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen?
SPEAKER_00: Maybe you have to say to make your grid.
SPEAKER_00: Does it do anything?
SPEAKER_00: No.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe you have to just clap it down.
SPEAKER_00: Back up again.
SPEAKER_01: It's off.
SPEAKER_00: It's off.
SPEAKER_00: I have to put it back.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It'll be okay.
SPEAKER_01: What was on?
SPEAKER_00: It's those laptops.
SPEAKER_01: Nice.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: But, so, this everybody has experiences with remote controls.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, not the ordinary remote controls, but also a little bit different ones.
SPEAKER_00: Like you can use for other.
SPEAKER_01: No way.
SPEAKER_01: Well, we're on the other.
SPEAKER_01: Kind of brought TV at home.
SPEAKER_01: And the DVD player.
SPEAKER_01: So we got like a lot of remote controls.
SPEAKER_01: One for the TV, one for the video recorder, one for the DVD player.
SPEAKER_01: And I think it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate the mall.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I've got one at home.
SPEAKER_00: And you can program, I think, eight different devices in it.
SPEAKER_00: And you can use it for your television.
SPEAKER_00: Anything else.
SPEAKER_00: And it also operates on infrared.
SPEAKER_00: So you have to got a little device inside your room.
SPEAKER_00: And then you can operate it from the third or second floor.
SPEAKER_00: So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or DVD player downstairs.
SPEAKER_00: And you've got a link to your TV on the second floor.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So that's a pretty handy thing.
SPEAKER_00: But only the, I think, if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, the next is a lot easier as well.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It's good to remember.
SPEAKER_01: So I think you can take minutes again.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It's nice.
SPEAKER_00: So we want different functions.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And we can maybe see if we can do something with infrared.
SPEAKER_00: But I don't know if that will exceed the production cost.
SPEAKER_00: So there's something we have to find out, I think.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But that would be really good if we could do that.
SPEAKER_00: And other functions for remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe we can make it the, it has to be sharp proof.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Sharp proof.
SPEAKER_01: My remote control tends to follow a lot.
SPEAKER_01: So should never know.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, what I prove.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So these are a few things we can think of.
SPEAKER_00: I will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, one other little thing.
SPEAKER_01: I thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it.
SPEAKER_01: So we can see the battery status.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: How much is left in the battery?
SPEAKER_01: But they'll also really drag up the production costs.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: We'll have to see about that too.
SPEAKER_01: But maybe just a little bit.
SPEAKER_00: That's an idea as well.
SPEAKER_00: Other ideas?
SPEAKER_00: Quick ideas.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: They were all mentioned.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Any questions about this presentation?
SPEAKER_00: Click off presentation.
SPEAKER_01: Nope.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder.
SPEAKER_00: And then we can all work finish meeting now.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: And we can all work on our own projects.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Then I'll meet you in about half an hour, I think.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So good luck.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
None: Okay.
