Speaker C: I'm sorry, not really.
Speaker C: Thanks for being here.
Speaker B: Your judgment is biased.
Speaker C: I need to do my control and stay for her time.
Speaker B: So, let's go for our detailed design meeting.
Speaker B: So, I will still play the role of the secretary and we'll have first the presentation by our user interface designer, David Jordan, and our industrial designer, Baba.
Speaker B: So, we'll have to evaluate your proposed remote control and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost.
Speaker B: In case if we all agree on the fabric of building a C3 remote control, we'll evaluate the production.
Speaker B: So, maybe I will let our two designers talk about some...
Speaker B: I have slides.
Speaker B: You have slides.
Speaker C: This is our product prototype.
Speaker C: This is made by Klin.
Speaker C: It looks strange.
Speaker C: The basic color is yellow and red. Yellow is our company color. I read it. It's more attractive.
Speaker C: So, we use two basic colors.
Speaker C: At the ship, there's two basic ships. The first is the cycle.
Speaker C: And the second is the triangle space.
Speaker C: We call it mushroom design. It looks like the mushroom design.
Speaker C: This is the introduction of our product.
Speaker B: Genetically modified mushroom, I will say.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: Yeah, the next slide. So, there are several key features of our prototype.
Speaker C: The first is that it is fancy. I'm sure this would be the unique design in the market.
Speaker B: Maybe I hope so.
Speaker C: Yeah, so it's a fancy design and a unique design.
Speaker C: The second key feature is that the circle channel selection.
Speaker C: In the traditional controller, you use button to select the channel.
Speaker C: But now we have a suck circle. So, we can turn this ball to select channel.
Speaker C: It's quite convenient for users to use it.
Speaker B: Yeah, but don't touch. Don't destroy your first time.
Speaker C: Okay. The third feature is the stable triangle base.
Speaker C: This triangle base is very stable. So, it's unlikely you cannot find it.
Speaker C: So, you can put it in the table. So, you can turn the ball to select the channel.
Speaker C: And there's some cute button. You can see the shape of the button is a mushroom.
Speaker B: Everything's mushroom. So, we can call our remote control that mushroom.
Speaker C: It was not really mushroom because you have lemon shape.
Speaker C: Yeah, that's why if you put it in the table, careful somebody will eat it.
Speaker C: I hope nobody will eat it anyway. You're trying to get the food aspect.
Speaker D: Mushroom was not in the trance.
Speaker D: For its vegetables.
Speaker D: It's vegetable.
Speaker C: It's vegetable.
Speaker B: It's something eatable.
Speaker C: We integrated the different color.
Speaker D: But this is not a mushroom anyway. So, it's fine.
Speaker C: I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable biasing.
Speaker D: These colors.
Speaker C: And spider color.
Speaker C: And very sophisticated material.
Speaker C: So, next slide.
Speaker C: So, what I can add is that he talks about what is outside.
Speaker C: So, what is inside is what we talked about.
Speaker C: The chip is a low level chip.
Speaker C: So, we cut it.
Speaker C: The low level chips inside.
Speaker C: And the LCD button.
Speaker A: So, where's the battery?
Speaker C: The battery is under the base.
Speaker B: In the base.
Speaker D: And where is the solar set?
Speaker C: This is a kind of new revolutionary receptor that we can put outside.
Speaker B: Do you think it won't be, it won't Christ increase the price?
Speaker C: I don't think so.
Speaker B: Okay, we'll see after.
Speaker B: We'll have the first.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: So, Mr. Monet, what's your opinion, according to this remote control?
Speaker D: I mean, we're going to try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about.
Speaker D: We had three key points for this remote control design.
Speaker D: And first one was fancy look and feel.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker D: So, we tried to judge this feature with a one to seven scale.
Speaker D: One being no.
Speaker D: I think.
Speaker D: Just let me check.
Speaker C: So, 4.3.5, it means it's acceptable.
Speaker D: One being true and seven being false.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker D: Oops.
Speaker D: So, do we have a fancy look and feel?
Speaker C: I think you have nice colors.
Speaker C: The shape, the ball shape.
Speaker C: Yeah, the shape is unique.
Speaker C: The colors.
Speaker D: I agree, it's unique, but is it really?
Speaker C: So, is it really fancy?
Speaker C: Do we define fancy?
Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, fancy was defined by fruit and vegetable look.
Speaker C: You have the lemon aspect of this.
Speaker C: This is it.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: Maybe if you change, if you take the buttons out.
Speaker D: Maybe do you think like that?
Speaker D: I don't know where the lemon is, but I mean, it's not obvious.
Speaker C: This shape is the lemon line.
Speaker B: It would be more like a lemon.
Speaker D: If.
Speaker D: Maybe improving the texture, like having less.
Speaker D: Less buttons.
Speaker D: Oh.
Speaker C: So, my mush.
Speaker B: Looks like more fruit.
Speaker B: Maybe a pineapple.
Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know.
Speaker B: And you know, you have the finger here with the buttons?
Speaker C: Yeah, it's a good idea.
Speaker B: It looks more like a pineapple.
Speaker B: Sorry.
Speaker B: What's the use for that?
Speaker B: I don't know.
Speaker C: If you want to tame the ball, I have no idea.
Speaker C: It's very convenient for you to tame the ball, to change the channel.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker C: It's embedded.
Speaker C: Yeah, that's the second point.
Speaker D: The second point is we have to judge the.
Speaker B: If it is fancy or not.
Speaker B: Fancy looking feel.
Speaker B: Is it better like that?
Speaker B: Okay, let's say it's a pineapple now.
Speaker C: The color is the color acceptable.
Speaker D: No, the color is okay.
Speaker D: That's fine.
Speaker C: So, the shame.
Speaker D: It's like.
Speaker D: I'd say there is more too much red.
Speaker C: Not too much red.
Speaker B: In the basement.
Speaker B: It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker D: Right.
Speaker D: So, from one to seven.
Speaker B: I'll give.
Speaker B: Seven is the maximum?
Speaker D: No, seven is false.
Speaker D: And one is true.
Speaker C: I'll give two or three.
Speaker C: Three, I will say three.
Speaker C: Three is fine for me.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker D: Three.
Speaker B: Is it better like that?
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: Then, let me.
Speaker D: What are the other criterias?
Speaker D: Is it easier to use technically, technologically innovative?
Speaker B: You said previously that there is some microphone inside.
Speaker C: Yeah, this is microphone ring.
Speaker C: It's a microphone.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: And you have the microphone ring.
Speaker B: There's the technology inside that recognizes simple vocal comments.
Speaker B: And you can turn it so maybe it's techno.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: So, you can.
Speaker C: I have a lot of things around remote control.
Speaker D: Yeah, but when you say technology, it's more in the core of the single.
Speaker B: We have tactile buttons.
Speaker D: Mm-hmm.
Speaker C: I said you have microphone ring, but you have...
Speaker C: No, that's good.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: That's good.
Speaker C: And you have this solar receptor.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: That's another really good point.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker C: I think that's not going to do it acceptable.
Speaker B: Maybe two.
Speaker B: So using the same scale?
Speaker B: Two?
Speaker B: Two, yeah.
Speaker C: Two.
Speaker C: You agree?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker D: Now, maybe the most critical one.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker D: Last one I would like to judge is...
Speaker D: Is it easy to use?
Speaker C: The local common, yes.
Speaker C: It might be easy.
Speaker C: Yeah, but it's stunning.
Speaker D: Can you just explain me the...
Speaker D: Can you just explain me the...
Speaker C: It's a print saying.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Please.
Speaker C: This is the base.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: So you can tend to change the channel.
Speaker D: Yeah, but how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels?
Speaker D: I think maybe if you...
Speaker C: Like if you want to go from...
Speaker C: Oh, I understand.
Speaker B: If you take...
Speaker B: Take from the remote.
Speaker B: So...
Speaker B: And you can turn like that to change the channel to...
Speaker B: Yeah, but imagine...
Speaker B: I think it's quite easy to do zapping, but maybe it will be too fast.
Speaker D: Yeah, I'm not definitely convinced.
Speaker D: It's the best way to...
Speaker D: If you want to jump from, I don't know, 1 to 20.
Speaker D: Yeah, that's different.
Speaker D: How can you go directly to 20, for example?
Speaker C: No, no.
Speaker C: It depends on the angle.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: I agree.
Speaker C: I agree.
Speaker C: But I mean...
Speaker C: You need to know...
Speaker C: Is it the channel wide?
Speaker C: So it could be channel...
Speaker C: I think something that's three, channel four, channel five.
Speaker B: Yeah, you have a click click click click click click click.
Speaker D: Just imagine you have 50 channels.
Speaker C: Oh, yeah.
Speaker C: 50 channels you buy the number by 330 degree.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: So you got how many degree you...
Speaker B: Yeah, but you have to go through all the channels.
Speaker C: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Speaker C: When you stop...
Speaker C: When you stop the...
Speaker C: The tone...
Speaker C: Mm-hmm.
Speaker C: Then the angle you stop, it's angle you, it's the channel you...
Speaker D: How do you know this angle is the correct one?
Speaker C: It's very easy because you know how many channels are there...
Speaker D: So you count at one degree, two degrees, no?
Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, you can do it.
Speaker D: I don't think so.
Speaker D: Yeah, that's great.
Speaker C: That's great.
Speaker C: I think so, you can...
Speaker C: Yes.
Speaker C: I think...
Speaker C: But the vocal common is easy to...
Speaker C: You can say 50.
Speaker C: Yeah, vocal common is okay.
Speaker C: 50, it's okay.
Speaker D: So we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be...
Speaker B: Yeah, but when you're zapping, you're changing from one channel to the other, so you're passing through all the channels.
Speaker B: So when you say I want to go to the channel number 20, that's you've decided to go to channel 20, so you can say channel 20.
Speaker B: All right, yeah.
Speaker B: Or channel 4, because you really want to go on this channel, but if you really want to...
Speaker B: And this would be more for browsing.
Speaker B: To do zapping, you don't really know what you want to do, you can turn it.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting.
Speaker D: Mm-hmm.
Speaker B: Seems to be good.
Speaker B: Good choice, Mr. David Jordan.
Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, you're famous.
Speaker B: And whatever you do.
Speaker B: Yeah, what's this?
Speaker B: What's this?
Speaker C: Cherry?
Speaker C: Oh, you can...
Speaker A: Also, the turner.
Speaker C: Turner for the tune.
Speaker C: Turner for the tune.
Speaker C: If you want to skip from channel 1 to channel 2, you skip this.
Speaker C: If you want to skip from channel 1 to channel 10, you turn this.
Speaker C: It's like fine from cost to fine.
Speaker C: This is cost.
Speaker C: This is fine.
Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker C: It's cost to fine.
Speaker C: It's great technology.
Speaker C: Yeah, this looks better.
Speaker C: Yeah, you see, this is from one channel to...
Speaker C: I didn't see where it is.
Speaker C: It's the turner.
Speaker C: Turner for the tuneer.
Speaker C: Turner for the tuneer.
Speaker C: Actually, it's one of the...
Speaker B: Yeah, you have the vocal comment.
Speaker C: Uh, it's...
Speaker C: On off.
Speaker D: On off, yeah.
Speaker D: Yeah, but it has to be on to...
Speaker B: Most of the time you have them.
Speaker B: Yeah, it's sleeping remote control.
Speaker B: Yeah, sleeping.
Speaker D: That's not the ecological...
Speaker D: That's true.
Speaker B: That's why we have the solar...
Speaker C: To come back to the end.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker D: So, which number?
Speaker C: Three.
Speaker C: It is, it's very relative, but three, it's fine, I think.
Speaker C: It's rather than a...
Speaker C: Do you agree?
Speaker D: Yeah, I agree.
Speaker D: So, the reason about this is four is one.
Speaker C: Three.
Speaker C: Three for me.
Speaker C: It's...
Speaker C: It's okay.
Speaker C: It's...
Speaker C: So...
Speaker C: Four.
Speaker C: Three.
Speaker C: Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and just take the...
Speaker B: Or what's your opinion?
Speaker D: Uh, we can even say, I mean...
Speaker D: Those are sort of agree, but this one would be more five to me.
Speaker D: Five?
Speaker D: I would like...
Speaker D: I mean, this is just a prototype.
Speaker D: I'm not really convinced it's so easy to use.
Speaker D: Yeah, so...
Speaker C: I don't know.
Speaker C: What do you...
Speaker C: What...
Speaker C: You compare with traditional...
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: To...
Speaker C: Traditional controller.
Speaker C: I think it's easier than traditional controller.
Speaker C: If you use traditional controller, you have to put the button.
Speaker C: And now you don't have to put the button.
Speaker C: You have...
Speaker C: You just tend the...
Speaker C: Yeah, but you know...
Speaker C: That's who kind of...
Speaker C: The smaller...
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: So you can control the scale.
Speaker C: But in the traditional controller, how do...
Speaker C: How can you control the scale?
Speaker C: By pushing zero...
Speaker C: You just put two buttons.
Speaker C: Zero.
Speaker C: That's the first one.
Speaker C: And one.
Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, you can do it.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: But you can also do it in the...
Speaker C: But if you do not want to browsing all the channels, you can just...
Speaker C: There's also a button here.
Speaker C: And there's some buttons, okay.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: This function is just for your broadened.
Speaker C: From one channel to the next one.
Speaker C: The next...
Speaker C: That's not what you say previously.
Speaker B: Yeah, if you're changing your mind...
Speaker B: This was the fine...
Speaker B: Fine to course.
Speaker B: Fine.
Speaker B: Of course.
Speaker B: And from 10 to 10 channels.
Speaker C: Why do 10, 10 to 12...
Speaker C: 10 to 20?
Speaker C: And this one, one, two, three, four, five, six.
Speaker C: Like this.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: So there's different scale.
Speaker C: So you can...
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: You can choose.
Speaker D: But this...
Speaker D: This has to stay on the table, right?
Speaker D: Mm-hmm.
Speaker D: This has to stay on the table.
Speaker C: Alright.
Speaker C: You can fuck on a flat.
Speaker C: This is just a bit.
Speaker C: You can just...
None: You can...
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker D: But then when you turn it...
Speaker C: Oh, yeah.
Speaker B: Just right?
Speaker B: No, no.
Speaker B: You can't put it out.
Speaker B: That's just your turn in from the base.
Speaker B: You need to have everything in hand.
Speaker B: If you want to turn, you can't use it and turn.
Speaker B: You need to put it on and turn.
Speaker D: You know, that's the weak point because with the traditional one, you just have one hand.
Speaker B: Yeah, but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen.
Speaker B: Say, I've lost the remote control.
Speaker B: Nobody would take it.
Speaker D: Yeah, you would never lose it on the...
Speaker C: So this is the next generation.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: Maybe.
Speaker C: It's the next prototype.
Speaker B: Maybe we can change from...
Speaker B: Maybe for it's okay.
Speaker B: For...
Speaker B: Easy to use for.
Speaker B: You can save it.
Speaker D: Yeah, for it's more.
Speaker D: It's even easier to...
Speaker D: Maybe.
Speaker C: You can...
Speaker C: You can error this.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker D: I don't know.
None: Yeah.
None: Yeah.
None: Yeah.
Speaker C: Yeah, for it's more than I would say.
Speaker C: So average...
Speaker C: Nine over three?
Speaker C: Three?
Speaker C: Three.
Speaker C: Three.
Speaker C: It's average, it's more than I.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker D: So...
Speaker C: It need maybe some further work, but...
Speaker D: Yeah, especially on the easy to use.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: Absolutely.
Speaker D: Target.
Speaker B: So the project is accepted.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker B: I think...
Speaker B: I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: If you really want to have a fruitful, remote country.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker B: So...
Speaker B: Is that fine?
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: We had a prototype presentation with the evaluation.
Speaker B: So as we all agree to accept...
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Under certain conditions, the prototype will have looked to the financial view.
Speaker B: So we need to calculate the projection cost.
Speaker B: As I said in the first meeting, when to have remote control, that would cost more than 12 and more than 50 euros.
Speaker B: And if not, if it's not the case, you would have to redesign it.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: So just have a look at the...
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: Here is the...
Speaker B: Excel...
Speaker B: Shit.
Speaker B: So...
Speaker B: So as the energy source, we have Hundinamo.
Speaker B: No.
Speaker B: We don't use that.
Speaker B: We have battery, right?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Not battery.
Speaker B: Kinetic.
Speaker B: We don't have it, I suppose.
Speaker B: But we have solar cells.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: How many do you need solar cells?
Speaker B: Do you think one would be enough for them?
Speaker B: Such as...
Speaker C: I think it's about...
Speaker B: You have three.
Speaker C: Three.
Speaker C: Three.
Speaker C: Three batteries, three solar cells.
Speaker B: So...
Speaker B: Electronic.
Speaker B: Single, simple chip on print.
Speaker B: Just one would be necessary.
Speaker B: Simple, yeah.
Speaker C: One.
Speaker B: Zero for the others.
Speaker B: And sample sensors and pull speaker.
None: One.
Speaker B: One.
Speaker D: One.
Speaker B: As we have voice recognition, I think.
Speaker C: Yeah.
None: Yeah.
Speaker B: So the case...
Speaker C: It would be...
Speaker D: So we are all already 19.
Speaker C: Wooden.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: Just...
Speaker B: Keep on going.
Speaker B: Just have an idea.
Speaker B: Yes, yes.
Speaker C: Wooden...
Speaker C: There's no good plastic just on anything.
Speaker B: Yeah, but what about case?
Speaker B: Uncurved, flat, single curved, double curved.
Speaker B: I think it's more like double curved.
Speaker B: That's a little bit of a double curved.
Speaker B: Yeah, double curved.
Speaker B: Yeah, double curved.
Speaker B: One.
Speaker C: One, yeah.
Speaker B: One, yeah.
Speaker B: Uh, wood?
Speaker C: But it's...
Speaker C: A rubber...
Speaker B: Do you want it's special color?
Speaker B: You may be too.
Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker B: Two special colors.
Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker B: Push button.
Speaker C: Yeah, we have four.
None: Five.
Speaker C: Five.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: Okay.
None: Okay.
Speaker B: Scroll wheel?
Speaker B: No.
Speaker B: It's more like integrated.
Speaker B: I think this will be like a scroll wheel.
Speaker C: Yeah, you turn it.
Speaker C: Sorry.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker B: Maybe two scroll wheel eyes.
Speaker B: Yeah, true.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: We have the course to find a scroll wheel.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: So, no button supplements?
Speaker B: No.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker D: No.
Speaker D: No.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: I think we have problem.
Speaker C: As you display maybe.
Speaker C: Interphase.
Speaker B: I think with...
Speaker B: If we keep on adding things.
Speaker B: It's okay.
Speaker B: That's fine.
Speaker B: So, we have to...
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: One of the key points is solar cells.
Speaker B: Maybe if...
Speaker B: If suppose if we change and we put just one.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker B: Has it changed?
Speaker D: Yeah, it was actually...
Speaker D: It did change, but...
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker C: We have to switch to electronics.
Speaker C: From the samples of the cell to regular tip.
Speaker C: Oh.
Speaker C: We have to delete the samples.
Speaker B: Yeah, but we have the voice recognition.
Speaker B: No.
Speaker D: Yeah, but this one, one of the features we were not able to...
Speaker C: Yeah, it's the one...
Speaker C: Maybe we have tumor and the first part in the basic version.
Speaker C: I think you can transform the wood into plastic maybe.
Speaker B: It seems that this can be...
Speaker C: Oh, it would be better.
Speaker C: Yeah, wood into plastic.
Speaker C: It should be fine.
Speaker C: Plastic is free.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker B: So, do we need special color?
Speaker D: Yeah, that's one of...
Speaker D: Because we have red.
Speaker B: Red and yellow.
Speaker B: Red and yellow.
Speaker D: We can turn everything in either yellow or black.
Speaker D: Black then is a regular color.
Speaker D: I think so.
Speaker B: If we try to have a kind of...
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Pineapple B.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker D: So, push button then it's the next...
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker B: And we have integrated scroll wheel with push button.
Speaker B: But now I think this is one.
Speaker B: Integrated scroll wheel push button.
Speaker B: So, we have only one.
Speaker B: And...
Speaker B: Push button.
Speaker B: Close to.
Speaker B: So, if we have all integrated in the scroll wheel and push button.
Speaker B: It's...
Speaker C: Okay, remove maybe...
Speaker C: You have five push buttons so we can just...
Speaker C: Try to modify some of them.
Speaker D: Okay, so what's the...
Speaker D: Like...
Speaker C: How about we change our color?
Speaker C: Double curve.
Speaker C: We can transform the double curve into single...
Speaker B: Something flat.
Speaker D: Yeah, but flat.
Speaker B: Uncurved.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: Yeah, maybe not.
Speaker B: Single curve better.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Single curve should be fine.
Speaker A: Ooh, quick.
Speaker A: Oh, we have only one.
Speaker D: Really?
Speaker D: One you were left.
Speaker A: Um...
Speaker B: Maybe don't...
Speaker B: No battery on me, so myself.
Speaker D: I think somebody gets...
Speaker B: I think there's a problem with the push button.
Speaker B: We only need...
Speaker A: Just one.
Speaker A: One push.
Speaker A: Just one.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: That's fine.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker C: So, actually...
Speaker D: So, we have one button.
Speaker D: Yeah, we have...
Speaker B: So, one button and...
Speaker C: One scroll wheel.
Speaker C: Scroll wheel with push button on it.
Speaker C: And the vocal cover, it's fine.
Speaker C: It's fine.
Speaker B: So...
Speaker D: It's good they're not charging anything for them.
Speaker D: So, yeah.
Speaker B: I think we've done a good job as the cost is...
Speaker B: Could we have looked at...
Speaker C: Could we have looked at...
Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker C: Actually, it's wrong.
Speaker D: We're not under...
Speaker D: The cost?
Speaker D: Yeah, but it's under our equal.
Speaker B: It's not rated.
Speaker B: Sometimes it's under our equal.
Speaker B: It's under our equal.
Speaker C: It's fine.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: So, let's see...
Speaker C: Twelve.
Speaker B: Twelve.
Speaker C: Fifty.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: It's fine, right?
Speaker C: Which part is the most defensive part?
Speaker C: Solar cells.
Speaker C: Solar cells, right?
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Is it?
Speaker C: Is it?
Speaker B: I think...
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: But it would be interesting for our marketing team to make lots of advertisements...
Speaker B: Yeah, to be able to sell to the same.
Speaker B:...and concerning these solar cells to be...
Speaker D: That's a nice argument.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker C: It's still for our...
Speaker C: It's really, really, really, really, very expensive.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Maybe...
Speaker B: Yeah, but it would be technologically innovative.
Speaker D: Yeah, but we just have one button.
Speaker B: So, it's easy to use in Powerful, as the remote controller has only one button?
Speaker D: Easy, you know, about Powerful.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker C: Easy Power.
Speaker C: Easy to use.
Speaker B: So, I don't think we need to redesign the product.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Or that's what we've just done.
None: We've done it.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: It's under the...
Speaker D: If it was low, high and so...
None: So...
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: Now...
Speaker C: So, what are we going to do with this project evaluation?
Speaker C: So...
Speaker D: I think we have to just have to discuss it.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker B: So, did you enjoy your clay modeling?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker B: Of course.
Speaker B: This is my job.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Was it a nice way to create your remote control?
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: It's a...
Speaker C: It's good to create a control instead of a computer.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: I think I found it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process from the beginning to the end and designing, looking at the chips, solar cells, and...
Speaker C: It is very informative for me.
Speaker B: And for the marketing guy?
Speaker D: That was good, but we should have more brainstorming like meetings maybe.
Speaker D: Because we're just presenting, one is presenting his stuff, next one his stuff, and then we try to combine afterwards.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker B: And new ideas about new products maybe, which would be fashion and yellow.
Speaker B: Yellow.
Speaker C: I think you can think about yellow TV now after a food TV or I don't know.
Speaker C: It can be interesting.
Speaker B: Yes, just lemon.
Speaker C: Yeah, just lemon TV.
Speaker C: You know the traditional TV is flat.
Speaker C: Yeah, it's flat.
Speaker C: It's square.
Speaker C: Yeah, the chip is very boring.
Speaker C: It's really boring.
Speaker A: It's really boring.
Speaker C: Come up with new TV.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: With such as this kind of TV.
Speaker C: So you can...
Speaker C: You can have this, triangle base, so you have the TV.
Speaker B: The lemon TV with the pineapple remot control.
Speaker B: Yeah, that's...
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: That is really interesting.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Because the TV...
Speaker B: Oh, that's interesting.
Speaker B: We could do a kind of fruit collection of...
Speaker B: Oh, you like this.
Speaker B:...electronic device.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker D: Yes.
Speaker D: You just don't trust too much the trends.
Speaker D: Maybe.
Speaker D: Because fruit and vegetables last for 10 years.
Speaker D: Yeah, maybe the message will be insects.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: But I think it's good to follow the flow and make it now and after, you know, if the people have changed their mind, you changed their mind.
Speaker D: Yeah, but this is good because it's not a long life product.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: TV is more like 15 years maybe so.
Speaker D: Yeah, that's a lemon TV for...
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: We can think about TV with, you know, where you can change, you know, the aspect.
Speaker C: So, like for the cell phones.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker B: You customize it every time.
Speaker C: So every time you go to a channel, you just change the appearance.
Speaker B: Oh, so, yeah.
Speaker B: You can do it all the time.
Speaker C: You can make it.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: And keep the number up here.
Speaker C: Yeah, and following...
Speaker C: The mood of person, the fashion.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: It's interesting.
Speaker B: Maybe we can create a line of TV.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: TV.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: But TV for autumn and a TV for winter, you know.
Speaker C: So, that's...
Speaker C: So, what is it?
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker B: So, I think the costs are within the project.
Speaker B: We're just...
Speaker B: Yeah, that's actually...
Speaker B: 12.50 euros.
Speaker B: So...
Speaker B: Do you think you can celebrate your own?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: You can celebrate your creation.
Speaker C: Yeah, you can celebrate your leadership.
Speaker B: Oh, thanks a lot.
Speaker B: Thank you.
Speaker B: Well, I say yes.
Speaker B: David Jordan.
Speaker C: It's really a celebrating object.
Speaker C: So, it's, you know, very...
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: It's very happy.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: It's a party.
Speaker D: It's a very much control.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: The thing now is to...
Speaker B: to sell it.
Speaker C: Yeah, it's your job.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker B: You sell it.
Speaker C: You sell it.
Speaker A: Good luck.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker C: Okay, and the...
Speaker C: 12.50...
Speaker C: 12.25 euros.
Speaker C: 25 euros.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's...
Speaker C: 25 euros.
Speaker C: 25 euros.
Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's...
Speaker C: 25 euros.
Speaker C: So, maybe a little bit expensive.
Speaker A: Maybe a little bit expensive.
Speaker A: No, I'm...
Speaker A: It's not so easy.
Speaker D: I'm not so happy about the fruit chip, you know.
Speaker C: What, really?
Speaker C: It should be fine, you know, actually.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: Maybe you eat it.
Speaker C: Maybe you eat it.
Speaker A: Maybe you eat it.
Speaker B: Maybe you can do a test, put it outside and you become...
Speaker B: I mean, you become...
Speaker B: I eat...
Speaker A: really fruit.
Speaker A: I think...
Speaker A: But don't put sugar in it.
Speaker A: The color I'm making is...
Speaker C: The color I'm making.
Speaker C: So, actually...
Speaker C: No, the colors are...
Speaker D: It's perfect, yeah.
Speaker D: It's perfect.
Speaker D: And two.
Speaker D: Yeah, another thing is the logo is missing still.
Speaker B: Yeah, but the color, I think the color is more...
Speaker B: The yellow, more...
Speaker B: The yellow, more...
Speaker B: I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for remote control.
Speaker D: Still, that was one of the requirements we had.
Speaker D: Yeah, but I don't think it's such a problem.
Speaker D: Just putting the logo somewhere.
Speaker C: We can put some...
Speaker B: Yeah, we decided to have something yellow and red for the costs.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: So, maybe we can just integrate it on one side.
Speaker B: The double R.
Speaker C: Okay, yeah.
Speaker C: That's a really good idea, so...
Speaker B: So, we have logo, we have the color, and we have the fashion in electronics.
Speaker B: So, we have the slogan too?
Speaker C: So, we have give him...
Speaker C: Give him...
Speaker C: Give him...
Speaker C: A cute name.
Speaker B: A cute man.
Speaker B: Yes, mushroom control.
Speaker B: No, it's the pineapple control.
Speaker B: You cannot say mushroom because it's not the same.
Speaker B: It's the pineapple now.
Speaker B: It's changed.
Speaker C: It's pineapple.
Speaker C: Pine apple.
Speaker C: Pine apple.
Speaker C: Pine apple.
Speaker C: Yeah, just flying saucer.
Speaker C: Let's carry him top.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: Oh, that's a flying saucer.
Speaker C: And he didn't fire him once in one.

Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: That's pineapple remote control.
Speaker C: I think it's fine.

Speaker B: Yeah, I'd try to.
Speaker B: I tried to.
Speaker B: 25.
Speaker C: That's beautiful.
Speaker C: I can't...
Speaker C: I would try to work and see how easy it is.
Speaker C: Yeah, you taught me you lost your control.
Speaker C: Yeah, I already saw that.
Speaker C: So...
Speaker C: To need buy buy.
Speaker C: So, if it is a universal, I can use it to my TV.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker B: One thing I like is the shape because, you know, it's not like the...
Speaker B: The remote controls you can put in your pockets, in your jacket.
Speaker C: This is why, this is why.
Speaker C: What do you choose?
Speaker C: I prefer the laser remote control.
Speaker C: What do you choose?
Speaker C: I think I will choose this one because of the color.
Speaker C: It's okay.
Speaker C: It's you light your house and your home and your TV.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker B: Oh, maybe next if we decide to do something, we can put light inside.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: That would be a nice one.
Speaker D: That's gonna be expensive, you know.
Speaker D: We have some problems.
Speaker D: I think...
Speaker B: Going to have euros and...
Speaker B: It would be interesting to just to see if we can...
Speaker B: If people will buy this one and maybe add some features to it.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker D: If it's a new trend.
