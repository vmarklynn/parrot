Speaker B: Okay, good after this again.
Speaker B: So we should have our final meeting about the detailed design of the product, although not control.
Speaker B: So there is the agenda for today.
Speaker B: I'm just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting.
Speaker B: Then we have a presentation of prototype Vue2.
Speaker B: Sounds interesting.
Speaker B: And I will have a presentation of evaluation criteria by our marketing experts.
Speaker B: Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the cost of the thing.
Speaker B: And hopefully we should fit the target of 12.5 euro.
Speaker B: Okay, so let's go.
Speaker B: If I go quickly to the minutes of the last meeting.
Speaker B: So we went through, we took these following decisions.
Speaker B: No LCD, no speech recognition technology.
Speaker B: We went through a bad analog in field for the remote control.
Speaker B: We went through the use of wheels and buttons.
Speaker B: And also the use of a basic station for battery charging and also to code the remote control when it is lost.
Speaker B: Okay, good.
Speaker B: So guys, let's present this wonderful thing.
Speaker D: Okay, so we can go to the slides.
Speaker B: Oh, yeah, sorry.
Speaker B: Number two, sorry.
None: Which is?
Speaker D: The final design, final design.
Speaker D: Okay, so, Michael, you can go ahead.
Speaker A: Yeah, so following our decision to make a yellow, well, to make a banana.
Speaker B: Yeah, can you show it to the camera maybe?
Speaker A: Okay, so.
Speaker A: We actually have a...
Speaker D: You can pull it out first.
Speaker A: Well, first of all, we made an attractive base station with a banana leaf.
Speaker A: Look and feel.
Speaker A: And banana sits in there, you know, nicely weighted so that it's not going to tip over.
Speaker A: And this is the remote itself.
Speaker A: It's kind of...
Speaker A: It's ergonomic if it's in the hand rather well.
Speaker A: We've got the two scroll wheels here, which, you know, one on the left for the volume and the one on the right for the channel.
Speaker A: And underneath we have the turbo button, which is in like a nice trigger position for pressing quite naturally.
Speaker B: Why is the use of the turbo button already?
Speaker A: This is when you're scrolling through the channels, you can tell it to skip the past channels that you quickly rather...
Speaker B: When you stop, it stops.
Speaker A: Yeah, well, when you stop scrolling the wheel, it stops.
Speaker A: But normally with...
Speaker A: It will just stay on each station briefly so you can see it.
Speaker D: And we do have one more functionality.
Speaker D: If you take the banana as such and you press the turbo button, so it's switch on the TV.
Speaker D: The turbo button.
Speaker A: So, rather than having an extra button for the on-off switch, we just use the turbo button.
Speaker A: Where is this button for?
Speaker A: This is the teletext button.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker A: So once you press that, then you get teletext and you can use the channel selector scroll wheel as...
Speaker A: Two navigation screws.
Speaker C: You want to go to page 700?
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: How many wheels is he?
Speaker A: Well, then you can...
Speaker A: You have like a little number selection thing.
Speaker A: You press the teletext button to move between the field and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have... you scroll to seven and then zero zero and then you can...
Speaker A: I don't understand.
Speaker C: Can you repeat this?
Speaker A: Well, you can press the teletext button.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker D: Then you can...
Speaker D: Then both the scroll buttons, they are for teletext browsing.
Speaker D: And you can tell it...
Speaker C: Ah, okay, okay.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker D: Once you press the teletext button, then the scroll buttons, they are more for teletext, they are no more for channel or volume.
Speaker D: I see, I see.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker A: And this is the infrared port.
Speaker A: That's right.
Speaker A: Also the top of the banana.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: Excellent.
Speaker A: And then we have in the base station, we have the button at the front for calling the banana.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: And the leaves play through all of the antennas.
Speaker A: Actually they do.
Speaker A: It's...
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: That's form and function in the one...
Speaker D: So it always means whatever the race goes back, they get reflected and then...
Speaker D: You are having a better coverage.
Speaker D: It's like antennas.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: So...
Speaker A: But yeah, that's just like...
Speaker A: That's an attractive base station.
Speaker B: Great.
Speaker A: So...
Speaker B: So...
Speaker B: So...
Speaker D: So...
Speaker D: What else?
Speaker D: And for the power source, we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries in this.
Speaker D: And the base station is going to have the input from the power line for...
Speaker D: For charging the batteries.
Speaker C: Is it really white?
Speaker C: Is it light?
Speaker C: Or...
Speaker C: It is very light.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: It's very light.
None: It's about the weight of a banana.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker A: You know, to give you the correct look and feel.
Speaker D: The bridge.
Speaker D: And we have put these different colors so that people don't mistake them.
Speaker D: Mistake it as a banana.
Speaker D: Otherwise it's...
Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker C: A child comes in.
Speaker A: I understand.
Speaker A: I think a child would try to eat it anyway.
Speaker A: So maybe we should consider that.
Speaker A: Maybe help them safety aspects.
Speaker D: Or we didn't think of that yet.
Speaker B: So for the power source, apparently you want to use both solar cells.
Speaker B: Oh, yes.
Speaker B: That's right.
Speaker B: I mean...
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary anymore for a recharging base station.
Speaker B: Where are you going to place them?
Speaker D: It'll be always the top somewhere there.
Speaker A: If I was going to place them, I'd put them on the top here since that's like...
Speaker A: Do you have enough surface?
Speaker A: But yeah, I don't really think it's necessary to have the solar cells.
Speaker D: Yeah, because now we have rechargeable batteries.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker B: So that is...
Speaker B: What would be the autonomy roughly?
Speaker A: The what, sorry?
Speaker B: The autonomy.
None: Autonomy.
Speaker B: What do you mean?
Speaker A: How long did the batteries now?
Speaker B: How long did it be out of a station?
Speaker A: A long time.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: Eight to ten hours.
Speaker A: No, no, no.
Speaker A: It should be...
Speaker D: What?
Speaker D: So the time it's not being used.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: So it's...
Speaker A: Yeah, but people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time.
Speaker A: People want to leave it on the couch, so...
Speaker D: No, eight or ten hours of working.
Speaker D: If you're just leaving like that, it'll be much longer.
Speaker B: Yeah, weeks.
Speaker D: Yeah.
None: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker B: All right.
Speaker B: Next slide.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker D: And we are having the speakers, regular chip for control.
Speaker D: Everything was a factor, so that's why we have gone for our regular chip only, not the advanced chip.
Speaker D: And that's it.
None: Okay.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: This is look at all the ways.
Speaker B: That's right.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: Those are very sounds.
Speaker B: Very good.
Speaker B: Nothing else to add.
None: So it's...
Speaker E: I like all that.
Speaker E: Yeah.
Speaker C: I like it.
Speaker C: Maybe the thing that convinced me the less is the multifunctional buttons.
Speaker C: Looks a bit...
Speaker D: You want to have more functional buttons?
Speaker C: Looks a bit puzzled.
Speaker C: I don't know how to say it.
Speaker C: The buttons change their function depending if it's not...
Speaker C: It's not...
Speaker D: We want to keep it simple so that this button is for teletext, which is usually also the case that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that, the channel buttons, they become the scrolling buttons.
Speaker C: And the volume button will become...
Speaker D: It's up to you means.
Speaker B: Well, in fact, both will be...
Speaker B: Could be useful.
Speaker D: That means...
Speaker D: Let's say this can move the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits.
Speaker A: Or can move between positions and the numbers.
Speaker C: What about people who want to use digits?
Speaker C: But...
Speaker C: Real buttons?
Speaker C: Wow.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: So there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape.
Speaker D: So we are targeting a segment which is just very trendy kind of thing that they don't care about the buttons anymore.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: And...
Speaker C: Have you thought about configuration and all this kind of stuff?
Speaker A: Also, all of it.
Speaker C: It's all automatic.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: Very good.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: We are living in a wonderful world.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Banana everywhere.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: So...
Speaker C: It's automatically comfortable.
Speaker C: It's...
Speaker B: So we have to go through now variations.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: So...
Speaker B: Your slice already.
Speaker B: Oh, you're four.
None: I...
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: So this is one...
Speaker B: Which one is this one?
Speaker E: Yeah.
None: Okay.
None: I...
Speaker C: I constructed a list of criteria based on the general user's requirements.
Speaker C: And its criteria is...
Speaker C: Will be evaluated.
Speaker C: It's logical criteria.
Speaker C: So we must... users must say if it's true or if it's false in a scale ranging from 0 to 7.
Speaker D: Why does strange vector of 7?
Speaker C: Because it...
None: Actually...
Speaker C: Sorry.
Speaker C: Sorry.
Speaker C: Usually I've seen that scale from one.
Speaker C: Sorry.
Speaker C: It's from 1 to 7.
Speaker C: It's from 1 to 7.
Speaker C: Sorry.
Speaker C: So you can even...
Speaker C: It should be an even...
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C:...scale.
Speaker C: And 5 is too short and 9 is too long.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker D: Fine.
Speaker B: Go ahead.
Speaker B: I'm...
Speaker B: To have enough granularity.
Speaker B: Sorry.
Speaker B: It's in order to have enough granularity in the evolution.
Speaker C: The variance is...
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: That's many more.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: Great.
Speaker C: I'm answering your question.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: I found more useful.
Speaker C: I think I could write the criteria on the whiteboard.
Speaker C: And we all four could range.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Could evaluate the...
Speaker C: Okay.
None: So you can say fancy.
Speaker E: Handy.
Speaker E: Okay.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker D: So you can say fancy.
Speaker C: Handy.
Speaker C: Handy.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: Let's evaluate if it's fancy.
None: Yeah.
Speaker D: It's fancy.
Speaker D: According to me.
Speaker C: Seven.
Speaker C: But...
Speaker B: Yeah.
None: Six.
Speaker D: Seven.
Speaker C: Seven by me.
Speaker C: Six.
Speaker C: I would say seven.
Speaker D: It's quite fancy.
Speaker D: So you can add seven plus six plus seven plus...
Speaker B: No way.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: Five.
Speaker A: Five.
Speaker A: Five.
Speaker A: Maybe six.
Speaker B: It's...
None: Okay.
Speaker B: Six point five.
Speaker B: Handy.
Speaker A: Again, I'd give it a six.
Speaker A: I think it's probably more handy than my current remote.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: I'd say scroll wells, but maybe it was the point for not having, you know, the extra buttons when you're real, if you do need them for some reason.
Speaker A: But, you know, you can always use your other remote.
Speaker B: So seven.
Speaker A: Seven.
Speaker B: Seven.
Speaker B: Six.
None: Yeah.
None: Six.
None: Six.
None: Four.
Speaker B: Five.
None: Fung Channel.
None: I'll give five.
Speaker D: Four.
Speaker D: I would say...
Speaker C: Well, it depends when you say functional.
Speaker A: Do you mean it does what we wanted to do or does what?
Speaker A: It does, you know, every coffee.
Speaker A: You know.
Speaker A: Every thing.
Speaker B: Every thing remote control does you have all the capabilities.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker C: It's compared to the all...
Speaker A: That's right.
Speaker D: Criminal control.
Speaker D: That's before.
Speaker D: The standards.
Speaker D: What is available in the market of the show?
Speaker D: I have to say four.
Speaker C: Actually, I don't know what are the real specifications of a universal...
Speaker C: Well, it's not a universal remote.
Speaker C: I have not a universal...
Speaker E: But it's for all kind of TVs.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Well, all TVs, but only TVs, I guess.
Speaker B: So it's universal, but for TVs.
None: Yeah.
Speaker B: So, four.
Speaker B: Five.
Speaker D: Five.
Speaker D: Four.
Speaker D: Four.
Speaker D: Four.
Speaker D: So four point two.
Speaker D: Just four.
Speaker D: Four.
Speaker A: Obviously, there's an outliers.
Speaker A: So...
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: Cool.
Speaker B: Cool device.
Speaker D: There I'll give it seven.
Speaker C: It means cool features like new features, actually.
Speaker C: That's right.
None: Which...
Speaker D: While a TV, the most important feature which I felt was the locator, which is a cool feature.
Speaker D: And then scroll buttons are again cool features.
Speaker D: We don't have LCD for it.
Speaker D: But that we decided we don't want to have.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker C: Seven.
Speaker C: I go to type five.
Speaker C: I'll say five.
Speaker B: Six.
Speaker B: Seven.
Speaker B: Plus six.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: I say, I six seven.
Speaker A: So it's...
Speaker A: You hit seven?
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: Because it's five, five, seven, seven.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker A: Definitely easy to use.
Speaker A: Definitely seven.
None: Seven.
Speaker B: Seven.
None: And you?
Speaker B: Five.
Speaker B: I'll play here.
Speaker B: Seven.
Speaker B: I'll play here.
None: Seven.
None: Okay.
None: I have them.
Speaker E: Okay.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker A: All right.
Speaker A: Now here's a 60 million dollar question.
Speaker A: Well, twenty five.
Speaker A: Twenty five.
Speaker B: You're right question.
Speaker B: Of course.
Speaker B: I would buy the mango butter.
None: Thank you.
None: What do you...
Speaker A: What do you got right?
Speaker A: Of course.
Speaker C: Of course.
Speaker C: The more difficult question for the end.
Speaker D: I'll say five.
Speaker B: Twenty five euros.
Speaker C: I find it quite cheap.
Speaker C: I don't know if...
Speaker C: It depends if you live in Switzerland or you live in...
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: So the target price is for all Europe, only for rich countries.
Speaker B: It's more targeting UK or...
Speaker C: I don't know.
Speaker C: The initial specifications were for the whole Europe or...
Speaker B: So this is selling cost, not production cost.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker C: This is the initial specifications.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: I'm going to say six.
Speaker C: It's quite cheap actually.
Speaker A: I'd say two.
Speaker A: One.
Speaker A: I don't want to banana or make...
Speaker A: I don't want to banana or make banana or make banana.
Speaker D: No, it's very handy actually if you see.
Speaker D: It is handy.
Speaker A: It's so handy.
Speaker A: It's handy but it's terrible.
Speaker D: Anybody who comes to your home, he'll at least ask once, what is this?
Speaker A: Yeah, but it's not a positive thing.
Speaker D: It's a very positive thing.
Speaker A: Well, it's handy.
Speaker B: It's ergonomic but it's a banana.
Speaker B: Don't forget...
Speaker B: Ooh, targeting or so.
Speaker B: I'm sorry, maybe it's...
Speaker A: I would buy this.
Speaker B: No, well, yeah.
Speaker B: I would be...
Speaker B: Yog.
Speaker B: Not telling that you are young.
Speaker B: Like a teenager, for instance.
Speaker A: No, it's I.
Speaker A: I would buy.
Speaker B: You're crazy teenager and you like fun things.
Speaker B: You want to plant this video girlfriend?
Speaker B: Yeah, you want to show the beautiful banana you have?
Speaker D: Or maybe it does some other kind of thing.
Speaker A: Still, I'd say too.
Speaker A: I don't think at any stage in my life I would want to banana or my control.
Speaker A: Really?
Speaker A: Yeah, crazy.
Speaker A: I can say maybe there is a market for it.
Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker B: So you say two.
Speaker D: I say five.
Speaker B: I say five.
Speaker B: You say?
Speaker C: I changed the question.
Speaker C: So what's your question?
Speaker C: I'm not sure.
Speaker C: I have loads there.
Speaker B: You have to reload?
Speaker B: Yeah, I think so.
Speaker A: Okay, so it depends if...
Speaker C: Yeah, it's two different situations.
Speaker C: If you really need a universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for a new one.
Speaker A: Yeah, if I had to spend 25 euro, if that was like my limit, maybe I would buy it.
Speaker A: Because the other 25 euro remote controls are probably going to look worse than a banana.
Speaker D: And they might not be as easy as they are.
Speaker A: Yeah, this is going to, you know, hand it to you.
Speaker C: So, when I'm...
Speaker C: I stick to a knife.
Speaker C: Although it still has six.
Speaker A: It still has the word of course at the beginning.
Speaker A: I don't know.
Speaker B: We have six.
Speaker A: I'll give it a...
Speaker A: I'll give it a four now.
Speaker C: So we are...
Speaker B: Six?
Speaker B: Six.
Speaker C: Five.
Speaker C: Four.
Speaker C: Six.
Speaker C: So it's 5.5 more or less.
Speaker E: Yeah.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker B: So the last question would I change my remote control for a new banana?
Speaker B: Zero?
Speaker B: No, we can't.
Speaker B: So one.
Speaker C: Actually, yeah.
Speaker B: Well, if it's the same thing, I will.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Let's output two.
Speaker A: I'd say three.
Speaker A: I mean, my remote control at time is pretty terrible.
Speaker A: If it was...
Speaker A: I changed my remote control of my DVD player for a manna banana, then I would be more inclined to.
Speaker A: For the TV.
Speaker A: But, because it's really bad.
Speaker A: But I'd say a three.
Speaker A: I'll still give it five.
Speaker D: Five.
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: Two, three, five.
Speaker C: Yeah, I'll go to three.
Speaker C: You're a romantic, really.
Speaker E: I would say two.
Speaker B: And two.
Speaker B: So it's...
Speaker B: So it's...
Speaker B: We had three point five.
Speaker B: Yeah, three point five.
Speaker C: Who is that?
Speaker C: Liar?
Speaker C: Who?
Speaker C: You said five?
Speaker C: No, I said five.
Speaker B: You say five.
Speaker B: Ease is the outlier.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: Just do some.
Speaker C: I don't know if...
Speaker C: It's...
Speaker A: It's not very promising, but, you know...
Speaker C: Well, because there are more...
Speaker C: Yeah.
Speaker C: We shouldn't sound like that.
Speaker B: Well, maybe we should...
Speaker C: Because the last two questions are much more important than the rest, actually.
Speaker C: Otherwise, we wouldn't...
Speaker A: I said some formula you're using that says you have to sound the mouse.
Speaker C: No, I didn't prepare anything.
Speaker A: Well, just leave it at that then.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Oops.
Speaker B: Maybe we should stick to a J.R. feeling.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: We can have an out of these numbers, which is that...
Speaker B: Well, we should go for it.
Speaker C: Do you want me to sound?
Speaker A: I think it's not...
Speaker A: I think it's not...
Speaker A: You just lose information if you sound it.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: So let's move.
Speaker B: Let's move on.
Speaker B: Yeah, sure.
Speaker B: Okay, sound...
Speaker B: No, no, you have to estimate the cost.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: So I prepare an exe...
Speaker B: an exe...
Speaker B:...an exe...
Speaker B:...what we are going to calculate the production cost.
Speaker B: We should...
Speaker B: We should be below 12.5.
Speaker B: So I already put some...
Speaker B: some numbers here.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: We are going to go through...
Speaker B: So this is the number of components we need.
Speaker B: For this thing.
Speaker B: So it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about.
Speaker B: And also things that I forget to put like solar cells.
Speaker A: Well, we just started against the solar cells.
Speaker A: Oh, yes.
Speaker A: I knew we stayed out.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: So let's go through all the lines.
Speaker B: So how did I move?
Speaker B: This is something we didn't thought about.
None: But...
Speaker A: You mean charging it by shaking the banana?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker D: I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: To bring the cost.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: So we stick to battery one.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: No kinetic.
Speaker B: So why don't I don't see the difference between kinetic and hand-in-o?
Speaker A: Well, maybe dynamo is like you have to actually...
Speaker B: Oh, you have to...
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: So kinetic is really shaking the banana.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: So...
Speaker B: So it's better, nice falling.
Speaker B: What's that?
Speaker B: Let's go ahead.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: So we only have one for battery.
Speaker B: And then for electronics.
Speaker B: So I didn't put anything for the month.
Speaker D: So we have the regular chip on the print.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: Which is one.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker B: And that's it.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: So we hit...
Speaker D: And we have sample speaker.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: So one.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
Speaker B: The cost is crazy.
Speaker A: Well, actually that sample speaker is not...
Speaker A: We're not using that.
Speaker A: We're just using the...
Speaker A: The beep.
Speaker A: The very beep, simple beep.
Speaker A: That sample thing is like the voice recording and everything.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker A: So I remove it.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: I say that...
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: So don't we need...
Speaker B: Well, there is no listing for radio-frequency thing.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker D: So we will put some extras.
Speaker D: If there is something...
Speaker B: Yeah, maybe.
Speaker B: We'll see later.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: So for the case, I put single curved.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker D: To reduce the cost.
Speaker D: It's okay.
Speaker A: Well, wait a second.
Speaker A: Because what we think...
Speaker A: It's double curved.
Speaker A: It's got a...
Speaker A: Oh, it's...
Speaker A: It's got walled at the direction.
Speaker A: So don't worry.
Speaker A: Well, yeah.
Speaker A: It's monotonic.
Speaker A: But...
Speaker A: It's got walled at the direction.
Speaker D: It's got...
Speaker A: But if you hold it...
Speaker A: If you hold it that way, that's too curved.
Speaker A: One on the side, one on that side.
Speaker A: But the opposite side.
Speaker C: Actually, where's this section?
Speaker A: I mean, this is probably...
Speaker A: It's a good one here.
Speaker A: This probably actually costs more than three issues.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: So let's put one here in the back end instead of single lock.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: Right?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: So we stick to plastic.
Speaker A: It costs nothing.
Speaker A: That's right.
Speaker A: Well, wait a minute.
Speaker B: No, didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber?
Speaker B: No.
Speaker A: Oh, if you drop it.
Speaker A: Too expensive.
Speaker B: Too expensive.
Speaker A: Oh, we're already at 11.
Speaker A: We'll come back.
Speaker A: We'll come back and see if we can fill it in.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: So I'll put a rubber one.
None: Okay.
Speaker B: So special core.
Speaker B: You know?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: For the interface, we have...
Speaker D: We don't have any push buttons.
Speaker D: No, we have two push buttons.
Speaker D: We have three.
Speaker D: No, that is a scroll wheel itself.
Speaker D: It'll be put in that.
Speaker B: No, no.
Speaker B: We have...
Speaker B: We call and we have three push buttons.
Speaker D: Okay.
None: Okay.
Speaker C: Actually, when you wrote regular tip, you should put two because there is another tip here.
Speaker B: No, it's always no cheap.
Speaker B: This is just radio frequency thing.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Yeah, but cheap.
Speaker D: No.
Speaker D: There's no chip there.
Speaker D: It just emits the signal.
Speaker D: It's just...
Speaker D: And the receiver accepts it and...
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker C: Sure.
Speaker C: It does nothing?
Speaker D: Actually.
Speaker A: No.
Speaker A: It's a rechargeer thing.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: We didn't think it thought about integrated core wheel push buttons.
Speaker A: Well, I actually did think about it myself, but I thought, you know, because you could potentially, you know, you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a...
Speaker A: Instead of a turbo.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: But, you know, the turbo button just adds that extra class.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: You know?
Speaker A: So, I mean, if we're over budget, then maybe we could rethink that.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker A: So, no LCD.
Speaker B: So, for... we have no buttons, deployments.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Right?
Speaker B: No.
Speaker B: Uh...
Speaker B: But in fact, couldn't we consider this button as a buttons supplement because...
Speaker B: Oh, no.
Speaker B: These are for colors and special forms, special colors and special materials.
Speaker B: No, we're not.
Speaker B: We don't need anything special.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: So, we are over budgeted.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: So, first thing which we should take care of is...
Speaker D: Make it plastic and forever.
Speaker D: Let it be plastic.
Speaker A: And then we're basically on budget except for, you know, in 10 cents.
Speaker A: And that much money will be required for the base station, which is not there.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker D: So, maybe, in fact, we have to put two here.
Speaker B: Because it costs nothing.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Yeah.
None: Yeah.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Yeah, well, yeah, the base station is made out of maybe yours.
Speaker D: It might be 90 centimetres for the remaining things which the cord and everything is too cool.
Speaker B: Exactly.
Speaker B: So, we have an margin for that stuff.
Speaker B: That's right.
Speaker A: Does that include charging circuitry and nothing?
Speaker A: Yeah, maybe.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker B: Good.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: What?
None: Excellent.
Speaker A: So, what do you do with the extra profits?
Speaker B: We'll invest in R&D.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Let me extra for it.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: So, well, we're under the cost.
Speaker B: So, we can go through two project evaluation.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker C: So, now we have a product which nobody would buy.
Speaker C: Would...
Speaker C: Yeah, would buy.
Speaker B: Sorry.
Speaker B: No, we have a product which none of us would buy.
Speaker B: The evaluation project.
Speaker B: Which is different?
Speaker B: None of us would buy.
Speaker A: No, it's people in Milan and in Paris.
Speaker A: I was like, I'm going to buy it.
Speaker A: Massively, yeah.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker A: We're not in Milan or Paris.
Speaker C: Yeah.
None: Okay.
Speaker C: You have been in Milan a couple of times, so...
Speaker C: Actually, there were a lot of batteries.
Speaker C: And you said the lowest.
Speaker C: The lowest is caution.
Speaker C: This is what we would...
Speaker B: You can.
Speaker B: The tangible battery.
Speaker B: Because I'm sick of...
Speaker B: Yeah, but that is...
Speaker B: Extra battery.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker A: So, project versus.
None: Wow.
Speaker B: In fact, I didn't know really what to say here.
Speaker B: If you have any ideas or what we can say.
Speaker B: So, I don't understand what they mean by satisfaction on the four example.
Speaker B: Should it be more like a status of these meetings?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: Well, in fact, we use a little bit of the whiteboard and the digital pen.
Speaker B: Not that much.
Speaker A: I think we had a fair bit of creativity.
Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
Speaker B: It's really creative.
Speaker A: And...
Speaker A: But I think one thing we missed out of this whole process was a focus group with...
Speaker A: The actual people were targeting.
Speaker A: We needed some of these kind of young transettes to come in and play with the banana.
Speaker A: And, you know, see if they liked it.
Speaker A: See if I like it.
Speaker B: Yeah, maybe we should go through, yeah, in the evaluation.
Speaker A: Because, yeah, the evaluation for us is kind of pointless.
Speaker B: So, maybe we should do a kind of evolution in the streets like asking to young people.
Speaker B: Well, do you like to have a banana as a remote control?
Speaker A: Because it would also be interesting to find out if we have a market in really young children as well.
Speaker A: To see, you know, how to market this thing.
Speaker A: Because, you know, well, I mean, maybe you don't want to give all your kids their own remote because they'll be changing the channel all the time.
Speaker A: But, you know, maybe in some households where there is, you know, TV for each kid, then, you know, banana remote control could be fun for them as well.
Speaker A: But, you know, we might have to draw a face on it.
Speaker A: So, but I think that's something we need to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker B: Any new ideas we could investigate next time?
Speaker B: I don't know, oranges?
Speaker D: Yeah, the cost of the thing can be made more than it might be.
Speaker D: Because I think it's just the optimal what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to.
Speaker A: Yeah, I think there are ways we could maybe simplify the interface.
Speaker A: Well, just the circuit board that we're using inside, I'm not sure really how complicated our needs are.
Speaker A: I mean, all we have is two push buttons and two scroll wheels.
Speaker A: Do we really need an integrated circuit to, you know, to process that?
Speaker C: So, more general remote control instead of just focusing on TV.
Speaker C: The complexity shouldn't be much higher.
Speaker C: You said if it goes for DVD, then I...
Speaker A: And also for, you know, for mood lighting and stuff that would be rather cool.
Speaker A: I think that's actually something that should be in version two, is the ability to control things other than the TV.
Speaker A: And not just electronic equipment, but, you know, the whole environment of the room.
Speaker B: Okay. Very good.
Speaker D: So...
Speaker D: More dense?
Speaker B: Well done. I think we can go home.
Speaker B: Home?
Speaker B: Happy that is right.
Speaker B: Maybe you can have the production department to make a real prototype that we can use at home to evaluate.
Speaker B: Okay, so thanks very much.
Speaker E: Okay. Bye.
Speaker E: Thank you.
None: We didn't get the hope of this time that meeting is five minutes.
None: Yeah.
None: It was longer than yours.
None: Okay.
None: No.
None: I didn't need that.
None: Oops.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
