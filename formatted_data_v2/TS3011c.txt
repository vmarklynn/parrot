SPEAKER_03: Do you need to change anything on it?
SPEAKER_03: Because otherwise I will already open it.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01: Unless things have suddenly changed again.
SPEAKER_01: Much changes?
SPEAKER_01: I don't know. Maybe...
SPEAKER_03: No, I don't like the last time.
SPEAKER_03: I only need the same information.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Hello, Mr. Pian.
SPEAKER_02: Hello, Mr. Pian.
SPEAKER_03: I believe Ms. Dental is with us as well.
SPEAKER_03: In the control room.
SPEAKER_02: Well, that's where the thinking goes on.
SPEAKER_03: It's the true again, always late.
SPEAKER_03: Bonjour, no.
SPEAKER_02: I think you should punish him.
SPEAKER_02: I see some interesting...
SPEAKER_02: You wish.
SPEAKER_03: People, welcome back.
SPEAKER_02: The third meeting.
SPEAKER_03: I have some points.
SPEAKER_03: I would like to point out.
SPEAKER_03: First of all, if you make minutes yourself as well, like Sebastian does, could you put them on the shared folder?
SPEAKER_03: If you do not make minutes, no problem.
SPEAKER_03: But it's easy for me to see what you wrote down, so I can use that in the report.
SPEAKER_03: The second thing...
SPEAKER_03: I was thinking to myself, I have this little remote control, and I'm talking to it, but I still need to point to the television, because it works with infrared.
SPEAKER_03: That's quite strange.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Okay. So, we'll come to that later, I think.
SPEAKER_03: The agenda for now, are there any pre-discussion questions?
SPEAKER_02: No, no.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: We will have your individual presentations than the decision on the remote control concept and the closing, 40 minutes in total for this.
SPEAKER_03: So, I think we can immediately start with the individual presentations.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: The progress you made.
SPEAKER_03: I think it might be smart to look at Root's information first, because I understood there are some significant changes in the market situation.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_02: So, just pressed OK button.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: My method.
SPEAKER_01: How surprising.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, findings.
SPEAKER_01: These views are important, but innovation is more important.
SPEAKER_01: And the fancy look and feel is even more important.
SPEAKER_01: And some fashion watchers found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their clothes shoes and furniture, and that they want spongy material.
SPEAKER_01: Probably too much sponge ball.
SPEAKER_01: The older group still prefers dark colors, simple shapes from material, but since we're concentrating on the younger group.
SPEAKER_03: Why this?
SPEAKER_03: Why this?
SPEAKER_03: Could you go to the previous slide?
SPEAKER_03: Because I'm taking minutes and...
SPEAKER_03: will be important in themes and clothes.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: The field of measurement is expected to be spongy.
SPEAKER_02: So, do you think when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes, that they are in remote controls also?
SPEAKER_01: Well, one example given was this.
SPEAKER_01: So, I assume they just want something colorful, not just an apple as a remote control.
SPEAKER_01: But like dark colors, you said.
SPEAKER_01: The younger group likes more colorful.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: But then I suggest the corporate colors are gray and yellow.
SPEAKER_02: Can you go back to the slide?
SPEAKER_02: Which one?
SPEAKER_02: Just one slide back.
None: No, no, no.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And the field of the material has to be spongy.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Has it something to do with that natural feeling also, do you think?
SPEAKER_01: Well, it might.
SPEAKER_01: Personally, I would like a sponge as a remote control, but maybe some soft material or something.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So, yeah, it might not be...
SPEAKER_03: It shouldn't be too hard.
SPEAKER_03: It may be rubber or...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, exactly.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And like...
SPEAKER_01: Oh, wait, the old one.
SPEAKER_01: The old one.
SPEAKER_01: It likes familiar materials, but that doesn't mean we should use wood.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, this is an example of what they would like.
SPEAKER_01: But since we're concentrating on the younger group, I think we should use soft materials and make it colorful or like cell phones, exchangeable covers.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So we could provide both for the young and the old, what they like.
SPEAKER_03: Well, that's interesting.
SPEAKER_02: It's quite interesting.
SPEAKER_03: You could make a few very colorful ones.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And a very traditional...
SPEAKER_02: I'm thinking about the banana ram, a telephone, a telephone from Siemens.
SPEAKER_02: The yellow rubber...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The phone.
SPEAKER_02: It's the rubber...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it is.
SPEAKER_02: It is.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And it's colorful.
SPEAKER_02: It looks like some banana.
SPEAKER_02: We have the fruit, we have the colors.
SPEAKER_02: Do you know the phone?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know the phone.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know the phone.
SPEAKER_02: It's the Siemens C25, I believe.
SPEAKER_03: It's the one that Postbank gave away.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, that one.
SPEAKER_02: The very...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I know.
SPEAKER_02: It's also a yellow.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I've seen it.
SPEAKER_02: I've seen it.
SPEAKER_03: You know, Root as well?
SPEAKER_03: I've seen it.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Do you have...
SPEAKER_03: That's about it.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So the important findings are innovation is more important than ease of use for our target group.
SPEAKER_03: And coloring is important and...
SPEAKER_03: And soft materials.
SPEAKER_02: Soft materials.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So ease of use is important, but technology is twice as important.
SPEAKER_02: And what was even more important?
SPEAKER_01: The fancy looking fuel.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So that's the most important thing for our customers.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: The rule.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Could you do your presentation?
SPEAKER_03: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I don't really have much to add because most of the things we already said in the previous discussion.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Well, it's good to sum up the things we already thought about.
SPEAKER_02: The previous ideas were a voice recognition and the round button for the channel programming and volume.
SPEAKER_02: Well, a few interfaces I found on the internet are these.
SPEAKER_02: These are both with voice recognition, but they're very advanced and very high tech and just, well, a weird...
SPEAKER_02: Shape.
SPEAKER_02: Shape.
SPEAKER_02: So I suggest I couldn't...
SPEAKER_02: I had a small mock-up sign on the...
SPEAKER_02:... but it didn't work.
SPEAKER_02: But pen didn't load the information.
SPEAKER_02: So I made a really simple shape in PowerPoint, but we could make around an oval...
SPEAKER_02:... which is more control.
SPEAKER_02: It's kind of organic, so that's very good.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And what I'm thinking about, maybe we should make very light, but a grip.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, this is how you hold a remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: It shouldn't be too...
SPEAKER_03:... a lot to...
SPEAKER_03: Slippery.
SPEAKER_03: Slippery.
SPEAKER_03: Because...
SPEAKER_02: We didn't have something like the Siemens phone.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, exactly.
SPEAKER_02: It's easier in your hand.
SPEAKER_02: There are also remote controls who have a little shape underneath...
SPEAKER_01:... where you can put your fingers.
SPEAKER_02: So you can get a really good grip on it, so you don't have to attain much pressure to it.
SPEAKER_02: It's a lot easier.
SPEAKER_03: It grips automatically.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I'll go into that deeper in my presentation.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Good.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, and to add on the route information.
SPEAKER_02: In this interface, we can have a high tech with a force recognition and...
SPEAKER_02:... well, the defensive colors and so on.
SPEAKER_02: And still have the ease of use because we have an easy interface.
SPEAKER_02: And all the other remote controls are high tech and buttons.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Way too much, I think, for our goal.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So if you have the force recognition, you can program like 30...
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I'll go into that because there are some possibilities and some impossibilities.
SPEAKER_02: I had a talk with our manufacturing division.
SPEAKER_02: And we had a talk about all the different components who are in this design.
SPEAKER_02: These are the things we've looked at.
SPEAKER_02: And of course, I use the web to find my information.
SPEAKER_02: About casing, we have three different casing possibilities.
SPEAKER_02: We have the uncurved or flat case.
SPEAKER_02: That's the most common remote control form we're used to.
SPEAKER_02: It's just a box.
SPEAKER_02: I'm sorry, I don't have any pictures of this thing.
SPEAKER_02: We have a curved one.
SPEAKER_02: It's curved in two dimensions.
SPEAKER_02: You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form.
SPEAKER_02: So it's a little more advanced in its shape.
SPEAKER_02: And we have an even more advanced shape which is curved in three dimensions.
SPEAKER_02: I think you can compare it a little bit with the big gray image you had in your presentation.
SPEAKER_02: You can compare the big remote control, something like that.
SPEAKER_02: But it's quite advanced and it's quite daring to use, I think.
SPEAKER_02: For these casings, we have different types of finishing.
SPEAKER_02: We can use plastic, which is very slippery and maybe not so nice.
SPEAKER_02: But you can give it any color, which is the same for rubber, but it's not slippery.
SPEAKER_02: We can use wood and titanium.
SPEAKER_02: We cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases.
SPEAKER_02: These latex cases, just the plastic ones, won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source, which brings me to the different energy sources.
SPEAKER_02: We even seem to have a head dynamos for powering our remote control.
SPEAKER_02: You really have to imagine winding up the rate.
SPEAKER_03: It would be very new to the market.
SPEAKER_02: It would be very new, but it's kind of a retro style.
SPEAKER_02: This is quite interesting. There's also a kinetic energy supply.
SPEAKER_02: When you're watching TV, you have to make some kind of energy, kinetic energy, by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall.
SPEAKER_02: It has to move. That's the sense of it.
SPEAKER_02: And you can store the energy in the thing.
SPEAKER_03: I think if I can, who can come to that?
SPEAKER_03: The kinetic thing is very funny.
SPEAKER_03: It's very funny indeed.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, solar is, of course, it's nice, but it's, well, your calculator has a solar panel.
SPEAKER_02: But if you're watching a movie, how many times you take the remote control and...
SPEAKER_02: Well, maybe if you have a watch, you have the kinetic idea in a watch also.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I know.
SPEAKER_02: You walk, but you sit on a couch.
SPEAKER_02: You know from your own watch.
SPEAKER_02: Your watch uses a minimum, it consumes a minimal amount of energy.
SPEAKER_02: The shaking of your body, which is almost every activity, makes your body shake, charges it.
SPEAKER_02: But the problem here is that it supplies a very little amount of kinetic energy.
SPEAKER_02: So I think you have a problem when you're watching a movie and you haven't moved the remote control in an amount of time.
SPEAKER_02: And you want to switch the channel or something.
SPEAKER_02: Well, it might not work. So that's something you have to keep in mind.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: But maybe there's a possibility to combine it with traditional batteries so we can save on the batteries.
SPEAKER_02: And when there's a near kinetic energy, used kinetic energy and otherwise use the batteries.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, because I guess the voice recognition feature consumes quite a lot of power.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, it does.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I'll come to that later.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And we, of course, have the traditional solar power, which is just a piece of material on the...
SPEAKER_02:...remode control, which transfers light energy into electricity.
SPEAKER_02: The user interface controls.
SPEAKER_02: Of course, we have the push buttons.
SPEAKER_02: And we also have scroll wheels.
SPEAKER_02: And the scroll wheels can also be integrated with buttons.
SPEAKER_02: So it's just like a mouse.
SPEAKER_02: You can scroll them. You can also push it.
SPEAKER_02: In the indicators, we have the LCD displays, which means you can watch in a display which channel you have chosen or something like that of the amount of volume, which is currently.
SPEAKER_02: And we also have double scroll buttons, which are just two of these things.
SPEAKER_02: So we don't really have the kind of button we had in mind in our last meeting.
SPEAKER_02: The thing with the round.
SPEAKER_02: We can just make four push buttons in the form of a round.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: It's disposable too.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: But I don't think the scroll wheels, I had some information about it too.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll wheels.
SPEAKER_02: I can't see any scenario where you would use a scroll wheel with a button on it.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe, well, maybe the...
SPEAKER_02: Maybe it's a bit of a remote.
SPEAKER_03: With maybe the channel selector.
SPEAKER_03: What about integrating a scroll bar on this side?
SPEAKER_03: That's the possibility.
SPEAKER_02: Because this is how you keep it.
SPEAKER_02: The floor is quite good.
SPEAKER_02: Think about a scenario where you would use the scroll button.
SPEAKER_02: Volume.
SPEAKER_02: Well, what he means is there's a button integrated in the scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_02: There's no scenario where you use the button in the scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_02: You just use the wheel.
SPEAKER_02: Well, what about mute?
SPEAKER_02: About mute.
SPEAKER_03: I guess this is my volume button.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: And I can either on this side or this side.
SPEAKER_02: That's one possibility.
SPEAKER_03: And click it to mute the device.
SPEAKER_03: And it makes it different from the traditional devices on this market.
SPEAKER_03: So I'm looking for a way to make it a little different than the traditional ones.
SPEAKER_03: So maybe I guess that's something you need to think about.
SPEAKER_03: What do you think about a scroll bar?
SPEAKER_03: A scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: Well, it's obviously new.
SPEAKER_01: So it might attract the young customers.
SPEAKER_02: But it's done before.
SPEAKER_02: There are many auto devices like telephones and our radio, pocket radios.
SPEAKER_02: We use this.
SPEAKER_02: And well, it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now.
SPEAKER_03: Well, all the Sony telephones use it, for example, for volume.
SPEAKER_03: Nokia has it, well, okay, it's not really a scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_03: But on their side, the volume button is on the side because you grab it like this.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, but it uses two separate buttons.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I know.
SPEAKER_02: It's not really a scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_02: There's something for you too.
SPEAKER_02: I believe if you have what we've already said, the grip places in the remote control, you have your hand on one place on the remote control.
SPEAKER_02: So you have to place all the buttons in the range of your thumb.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, you have to.
SPEAKER_02: So in that case, the volume button on the side of the remote control would be perfect.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Sebastian, then.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: We have to know, if you want to use these rubber double curved case, you must use these push buttons.
SPEAKER_02: There's no way you can integrate LCD displays.
SPEAKER_02: There's no way you can integrate scroll wheels because it's all curved.
SPEAKER_02: There are no flat areas where you can incorporate these things.
SPEAKER_02: So that's a limitation about the components, just the hardware.
SPEAKER_02: We basically have three types of chips we can use.
SPEAKER_02: And these chips incorporate all the largeica and hardware that is needed to send signal.
SPEAKER_02: We have a simple regular and advanced chip.
SPEAKER_02: And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker, which is a little cryptic to me.
SPEAKER_02: But I think that's the voice recognition thing that we are thinking about.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you can have some information about it.
SPEAKER_02: In the voice recognition, you say a word.
SPEAKER_02: You can program a word like volume up.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So mute.
SPEAKER_02: Let's say mute.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: You program it, you mute, and you give an action to it.
SPEAKER_02: Just really the mute function.
SPEAKER_02: And when you speak in the remote control, it repeats your saying.
SPEAKER_02: So that's the sample sensor.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So if you say mute, it says mute again.
SPEAKER_02: And then it's, when I believe it.
SPEAKER_02: It performs the action.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And then your piece is action which you believe it is.
SPEAKER_02: You say mute, you repeat mute, and it makes the computer sound mute.
SPEAKER_02: And then goes to the mute function.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So that's basically the voice recognition item we were searching for.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: This sample sensor requires regular chip, I thought.
SPEAKER_02: No, well, I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_02: No, it's not in here.
SPEAKER_02: If we want to use the LCD display, we really need the advanced version, which is a little bit more costly.
SPEAKER_02: If we want to use the screw wheels, we need the regular version.
SPEAKER_02: And if we don't want to use any of these more advanced functions, we can keep with the simple chip, which is a bit cheaper.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Did we already decide on the display?
SPEAKER_02: No, but I think that's something for the whole here.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I don't have a look for information about it.
SPEAKER_02: But I don't think information, I don't think you need it on the display.
SPEAKER_02: Especially when we have to look at the cost, I don't think you need it.
SPEAKER_02: Any TV can view it on screen.
SPEAKER_02: On screen, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Well, my conclusion, unfortunately, the market has decided a little other than I thought.
SPEAKER_02: I thought the market would like a sort of titanium casing, but they seem to like natural stuff.
SPEAKER_02: So maybe we should think about wood finish.
SPEAKER_02: I've chosen the more battery with solar cell solution for the energy.
SPEAKER_02: It's more reliable, it's cheaper.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So I don't think we should use the diagonal thing.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: It's more advanced, but I think you should combine it with batteries.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: It's maybe a bit too flashy too.
SPEAKER_02: Well, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: In some way, it can give us an offense because you will save on your batteries.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but that's the same with the solar cell.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's more robust.
SPEAKER_02: But what about the market, what colorful designs?
SPEAKER_02: So if we use titanium.
SPEAKER_03: No, no.
SPEAKER_03: That's what Sebastian said.
SPEAKER_03: He said this is my personal preference, but yet I understood that the market is different.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, sorry.
SPEAKER_02: I think we should skip the titanium stuff and we should use wood or something like that.
SPEAKER_01: And I would think that the rubber with colors.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the older people liked wood.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, okay, sorry.
SPEAKER_02: It needs to be rubber.
SPEAKER_02: Call it the younger people like soft material.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Spongy materials.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Well, these scroll wheels, I think they can be handy.
SPEAKER_02: And they can be implemented with a regular chip?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, they can.
SPEAKER_02: But they really need a regular chip.
SPEAKER_02: You cannot use the same software.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: But also, we already need a regular chip for the sample.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I'm not so sure.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe that's a big thing.
SPEAKER_03: No, but do you want the curved design or?
SPEAKER_02: I think so.
SPEAKER_02: If you stick with the simple, straightforward, not curved design.
SPEAKER_02: It's too dull.
SPEAKER_02: It's too dull.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think our customers will like it.
SPEAKER_02: And if you take the double curved, then you cannot only use the rubber buttons.
SPEAKER_02: You cannot use the scroll wheels.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I think this is the best of two wheels.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: What about the issue I addressed at the beginning of the meeting?
SPEAKER_03: The voice function with the infrared issue.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Because it's, of course.
SPEAKER_02: I can imagine.
SPEAKER_02: It's very dull to talk to a device, if you have to point to another device.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's very logical.
SPEAKER_02: But most infrared remote controls don't have to be pointed at all.
SPEAKER_02: Well, there has to be some pointing.
SPEAKER_02: It depends also on your hand before.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: It won't work.
SPEAKER_02: But you can point it just.
SPEAKER_02: Well, it depends on your walls, actually.
SPEAKER_03: If you have smooth walls, you're probably right.
SPEAKER_03: But if you have carpets on the wall, which are natural, loving friends, probably do have, then, yeah, it might be a bit more of an issue.
None: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Because the walls, they reflect the infrared light.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So, it's easier.
SPEAKER_02: I suggest we use the sensor sample.
SPEAKER_02: The sample sensor and sample speaker.
SPEAKER_02: With a regular chip.
SPEAKER_02: I think it gives us the advantage of the scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: I like the scroll wheels.
SPEAKER_02: I skipped the LCD part.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think it's any value added.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: Thanks.
SPEAKER_03: Well, it looks, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Well, according to the market likes new flashy technology.
SPEAKER_03: And I mean, else today is...
SPEAKER_02: It's not very flashy.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I know.
SPEAKER_03: It's less...
SPEAKER_03: Standard?
SPEAKER_03: Standard than...
SPEAKER_03: Well, we are not very...
SPEAKER_03: We do not know much about the financial part.
SPEAKER_03: That's the problem.
SPEAKER_03: Because if we do have enough space in our finance, I would say do integrate it because it adds a little extra high-tech feeling to it.
SPEAKER_02: But we all have the scroll wheels, the speaker recognition, the rubber, I think our customer is so good.
SPEAKER_02: The fancy color.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: It's too much.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I agree.
SPEAKER_03: I think...
SPEAKER_03: Do you have anything you would like to add or maybe thought or...
SPEAKER_01: No, I don't think so.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: No, no.
SPEAKER_02: Nothing more.
SPEAKER_03: Nothing more.
SPEAKER_02: The next phase will be...
SPEAKER_02: What's the next phase to the floors?
SPEAKER_03: Well, we need to describe decisions now.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So, on energy, well, we decided...
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: The case, rubber with one curve.
SPEAKER_03: Use the interface.
SPEAKER_02: But it can't go with...
SPEAKER_02: With one curved case?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, they can work.
SPEAKER_02: Sorry.
SPEAKER_02: They cannot work with double curved.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, sorry.
SPEAKER_02: Just a problem.
SPEAKER_02: I'll check it for you.
SPEAKER_03: Then the corporate identity should be in the product.
SPEAKER_03: I guess that is something for Ruhl and Sebastian.
SPEAKER_03: You talked about it before the colors.
SPEAKER_03: Gray and yellow.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Keep it in mind.
SPEAKER_03: And the buttons, well, we talked about it now.
SPEAKER_03: The next phase, Sebastian, is the design of the look and feel.
SPEAKER_03: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_03: The user interface design.
SPEAKER_03: And for you, the product evaluation, I'm sure your personal coach will give you.
SPEAKER_03: More information on that.
SPEAKER_03: And the ID and the UID need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smartboard.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And I'm going to plan my holidays.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So, you will build the house for the next...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's...
SPEAKER_03: When we come back in 30 minutes, you will have a prototype ready.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So, can you give us a summary of all decisions we've made?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I can.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe one of you could write it down.
SPEAKER_03: I'll do.
SPEAKER_03: Great.
SPEAKER_03: You need to help me.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Start with the casing.
SPEAKER_03: The casing is curved.
SPEAKER_02: Single curved.
SPEAKER_02: Single curved.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: What about the energy source?
SPEAKER_03: Traditional batteries and solar.
SPEAKER_02: But can I be...
SPEAKER_02: Can I work together?
SPEAKER_02: When you have to choose between them.
SPEAKER_02: No, they can be complementary.
SPEAKER_02: I think they can.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_02: Well, what...
SPEAKER_02: Every device.
SPEAKER_02: It should be.
SPEAKER_02: There should be a real problem.
SPEAKER_02: There can be a supplementary.
SPEAKER_02: There's no problem.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, okay.
SPEAKER_02: So, just...
SPEAKER_02: The energy source is...
SPEAKER_02: The battery.
SPEAKER_02: And the solar.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: What about the finishing of the case?
SPEAKER_02: We have decided we wanted to use the rubber.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Colorful rubber.
SPEAKER_03: If it's possible with different covers.
SPEAKER_03: But I'm not sure if our suppliers can help us with such a wish.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And I think we should use the company color.
SPEAKER_02: Something like black and red.
SPEAKER_02: Or black and yellow.
SPEAKER_03: Gray and yellow.
SPEAKER_03: Gray and yellow.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yellow case and gray buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Although, I don't think that's very colorful.
SPEAKER_03: Except for the yellow, of course.
SPEAKER_03: But I could think of a more attractive set of colors.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's...
SPEAKER_02: It's not very dull.
SPEAKER_02: It's quite modern, actually.
SPEAKER_02: Don't you think?
SPEAKER_03: Well, I was more thinking about the fruit colors that the root show just before.
SPEAKER_02: But you have already...
SPEAKER_02: You must have a red on and off button.
SPEAKER_02: And...
SPEAKER_03: Well, it doesn't have to be red.
SPEAKER_03: Well...
SPEAKER_03: I mean, I think these colors are really what our young people are looking for.
SPEAKER_03: So maybe it shouldn't even be two colors.
SPEAKER_03: It should be a full color cover with such an image.
SPEAKER_03: Or...
SPEAKER_03: I mean...
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Thinking in two colors is too black and white for our market group, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, black and yellow.
SPEAKER_01: Black and yellow.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: But I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on the device.
SPEAKER_02: Because I agree it would be nice to have something like that on the device itself.
SPEAKER_02: Well, there is.
SPEAKER_02: Just a week ago.
SPEAKER_02: Keyboard manufacturer.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I've read.
SPEAKER_02: With print.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, fine art and...
SPEAKER_02: Yes, but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its techniques.
SPEAKER_02: They're actually very slow-heads techniques.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so we have to deal with what's possible here.
SPEAKER_02: So, I'm afraid it's not possible.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: More decisions we made.
SPEAKER_01: Um...
SPEAKER_02: The scroll wheel?
SPEAKER_03: The scroll wheel, yes.
SPEAKER_03: The voice recognition.
SPEAKER_03: We already decided.
SPEAKER_02: Of course.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So scroll wheel, but there will be some additional buttons, I guess.
SPEAKER_02: And they should be spongy also.
SPEAKER_02: Because they're rubber too.
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to leave that up to you too.
SPEAKER_02: What did you say?
SPEAKER_02: Well, you can use, well, when you use the buttons, they'll be made of rubber too.
SPEAKER_02: So it has the spongy, fuel also.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So I think that's okay.
SPEAKER_02: Or you could use plastic buttons in the rubber.
SPEAKER_03: I think rubber is nice.
SPEAKER_03: Because I mean, what do you touch the button and what do they want, spongy devices?
SPEAKER_02: But then you just have the fact that the trunks on the buttons will disappear eventually.
SPEAKER_03: It's really?
SPEAKER_02: What I said in the first discussion, the digit 6 on the button, it will disappear when it's from rubber.
SPEAKER_03: Is that...
SPEAKER_03: Does our virus say something?
SPEAKER_02: It's not something that no information I read about it or so.
SPEAKER_01: But did we include the digits?
SPEAKER_01: No, but...
SPEAKER_01: Because things like volume could be placed next to the button.
SPEAKER_03: You could place a...
SPEAKER_03: This would be the button.
SPEAKER_03: The scroll wheel, I mean.
SPEAKER_03: And you could place the signals.
SPEAKER_03: So you don't touch it?
SPEAKER_02: That's possible.
SPEAKER_02: But then you have still the images on the rubber of the case.
SPEAKER_02: Still then, if you feel your remote control, you just rub on the cover.
SPEAKER_02: So you rub on the painting.
SPEAKER_03: No, no, there's no painting.
SPEAKER_03: Only yellow or the digits into the rubber.
SPEAKER_02: But the plus or the minus?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, the sign.
SPEAKER_02: If this is on the cover.
SPEAKER_02: It's on the cover.
SPEAKER_03: I think... I know what you understand.
SPEAKER_03: I know what you mean.
SPEAKER_03: Just move the problem.
SPEAKER_03: What about making this rubber and making this plastic?
SPEAKER_02: I see what you mean.
SPEAKER_02: Well, maybe that's possible because our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing.
SPEAKER_02: So maybe they can combine these two.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Well, actually we should have it the other way around, I guess.
SPEAKER_03: A plastic cover with rubber finishing.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, this is the finishing.
SPEAKER_03: This is what's on the edge, what you feel.
SPEAKER_03: The front on which the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not so sure.
SPEAKER_02: Can you separate these?
SPEAKER_02: Well, I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_02: I have to ask with manufacturing.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not sure that's what you want because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel.
SPEAKER_02: And that's what you get with rubber.
SPEAKER_02: So if you want a spongy feel, you need to make these buttons all of rubber.
SPEAKER_03: I know, but do you touch this or do you touch this?
SPEAKER_03: I mean, I never touch between the buttons.
SPEAKER_02: I do.
SPEAKER_02: I do.
SPEAKER_02: The sideways or?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the sideways.
SPEAKER_03: Exactly.
SPEAKER_03: The sideways.
SPEAKER_03: The side.
SPEAKER_03: But do you touch between these buttons?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, especially when there are a few buttons on it.
SPEAKER_02: You have a lot of space to touch.
SPEAKER_02: So you just have it in your hand completely or...
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Well, we do not have very much time left.
SPEAKER_03: I guess you two have to figure that out.
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to leave the decision to you because you have to make its prototype.
SPEAKER_03: And yeah, you have the most knowledge about the suppliers, the possibilities.
SPEAKER_03: So I'm going to leave the decision with you.
SPEAKER_03: So, whilst, did you write enough decisions down?
SPEAKER_02: Not quite.
SPEAKER_02: What about the chips?
SPEAKER_02: We use the regular chip.
SPEAKER_02: Regular line.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
None: Yeah.
None: And...
SPEAKER_02: Well, I think that's about it.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: With those regular chips, we can still control advanced functions.
SPEAKER_03: The chip is not really...
SPEAKER_02: The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced version of the chip supports LCD.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Well...
SPEAKER_02: And we've decided not to use LCD so...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And I think we are quite finished.
SPEAKER_03: I'll see you guys in 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_02: The finishing touch.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: If you wrote anything down, could you put it on the shared folder?
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But Sebastian has everything.
SPEAKER_03: I know, but...
SPEAKER_03: Well...
SPEAKER_02: I'll put it online.
SPEAKER_03: Great.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: I'm going to demonstrate.
None: I'm like...
None: Oh.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Yeah.
None: I can put it on a floor.
None: Okay.
None: Yeah.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Hi.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Vima.
None: I cut it away from online, and I'm doing it, and I'm going to add to it.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
