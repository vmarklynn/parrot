SPEAKER_02: Okay, this is our final meeting, the detailed design meeting.
SPEAKER_02: And again, I'll take minutes, but what we have to get through in this meeting is, firstly, the prototype presentation for you two, so you can show us what you've been looking at diligently. There's my way call.
SPEAKER_02: Then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against.
SPEAKER_02: Then I need to say since a few things about finance, because we have to check that it's within the finance criteria.
SPEAKER_02: And then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria, Cat and the financial limit.
SPEAKER_02: And then we will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design.
SPEAKER_02: So we've got 40 minutes.
SPEAKER_04: And then we get to make it a little more comfortable.
SPEAKER_02: Because we missed out.
SPEAKER_02: So, it's now, I guess that was the start of 15.35.
SPEAKER_02: So we've got until 4.
SPEAKER_01: How much do we have?
SPEAKER_01: 40 minutes.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, about 4.15.
SPEAKER_00: So, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, go for it.
SPEAKER_03: Do you want to?
SPEAKER_03: So, is it, are we starting with a, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, will you maybe start with like the shape and things?
SPEAKER_03: And then I will explain the user interface.
SPEAKER_03: Things like the buttons and the screw.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so, basically going without a trend of vegetables.
SPEAKER_01: And we selected the color and approximate shape of banana.
SPEAKER_04: So, basically it's the flip open thing again.
SPEAKER_02: So, we have the, okay.
SPEAKER_01: Marika would explain user user interface here.
SPEAKER_01: And it flips open on the side.
SPEAKER_01: So, it opens like that.
SPEAKER_01: And we have the user interface.
SPEAKER_01: In here and the LCD and the screw on the inside.
SPEAKER_01: Well, everything else is probably using the face.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, things made of rubber.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It is, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Is it yellow? Do you think you make it a bit smaller?
SPEAKER_03: It could be made a bit smaller.
SPEAKER_03: And of course it would be shiny.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but one thing we actually kind of forgot while designing it, one side was supposed to be rounder.
SPEAKER_03: So, is it the backside round?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But it's in the smith of rubber anyway.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's good.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it does look like the fence like curvy and then the whole shapes curvy.
SPEAKER_04: I would say that this curvy is quite like a vegetable.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And it's spongy as well.
SPEAKER_03: I would say, Keenan.
SPEAKER_03: So, are they using the face as we discussed last time on the, on the cover, we just have the very basic things.
SPEAKER_03: So, we have the channels here starting from one, two, three.
SPEAKER_03: There would be numbers on the actual one.
SPEAKER_03: So, it's four up to four up to seven up to nine and zero here.
SPEAKER_03: And zero here.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And then, well, this is on off button.
SPEAKER_03: It's quite standard place for it and also the color is quite often red.
SPEAKER_03: So, it's kind of user friendly.
SPEAKER_03: And then this one would be for flipping the canals back in like the previous one and the next one.
SPEAKER_03: And we would also have a little thing saying here, previous and then, a preven, preven next.
SPEAKER_00: So, where's the volume?
SPEAKER_03: The volume is scrolling on the side.
SPEAKER_03: You just did it like this.
SPEAKER_03: And, and it's on the back cover or back lid because if you flip it open, you can still do the scrolling here.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, Keenan.
SPEAKER_03: See.
SPEAKER_03: So, the volume is, you just scroll, but then once you flip it open, okay, there you have the screen.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And you have the spinning wheel with options to choose.
SPEAKER_03: You can move back and forth and then if you need to choose something on the screen, you just push the send in the middle button.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, the thing we forgot was like a mute button.
SPEAKER_03: A mute button.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: We would not put that in.
SPEAKER_03: We'll have this on the screen, on the display.
SPEAKER_01: So, on the cover, we have the bare essentials.
SPEAKER_04: On the wheel, if you peel down, then it will.
SPEAKER_01: On the LCD, you know, the main one you will have with this option.
SPEAKER_03: But the, yeah, the scrolling is kind of, you have to scroll on the way to make it mute, right?
SPEAKER_03: But if you're all the scrolling click, isn't it?
SPEAKER_04: That's the scrolling click.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Cool.
SPEAKER_03: So, that's why I was a whole mutitian.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And okay, so, so the voice recognition is also just part of it.
SPEAKER_03: You can't really see it in the face.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's hidden in there.
SPEAKER_03: And we do have the logo.
SPEAKER_03: Very good.
SPEAKER_02: So, I think, and it's with the black and yellow and the red and the black color.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, yeah, I think we could do the logo in gray as it is on the website.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You can have a question.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Let's have a look.
SPEAKER_02: Let's have a look.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So, it's sort of intermediate color.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Oh.
SPEAKER_04: It is beautiful.
SPEAKER_04: Cold and slimy.
SPEAKER_04: I hate K-Day.
SPEAKER_04: It's just mingled.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, that's cool.
SPEAKER_04: Very good.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So, maybe if we go on to evaluation criteria and then we'll...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I suspect we're going to have a couple of minor finance issues.
SPEAKER_02: I'm sure we can get around them somehow.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country.
SPEAKER_02: We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some of the places that we're in.
SPEAKER_04: Wales.
SPEAKER_04: Wales, for example.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Right.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
None: Okay.
None: Cool.
None: Cool.
None: Cool.
None: Cool.
None: Cool.
None: Cool.
None: Cool.
None: Cool.
None: Cool.
None: Cool.
None: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: So, we're going to be using the seven points scale.
SPEAKER_04: So, one is, you know, yes, it totally meets what that requirement.
SPEAKER_04: And seven is, no, it really doesn't.
SPEAKER_04: We need to go back and start again.
SPEAKER_04: You know, basically what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them.
SPEAKER_04: You know, so that we can evaluate each one and like, so it's about going back to the start and saying, oh yeah, we did manage to do that or I know we really forgot that.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: So, these are what they are.
SPEAKER_02: So, for each of these, we need to give it a one to seven.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: I did have a BC and D down here, but it seems to have turned into like just blood on.
SPEAKER_04: Never mind.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: But if you can imagine that they say ABC and D, that would be really good.
SPEAKER_01: I guess we'll give it maximum points and everything.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's definitely attractive.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I agree.
SPEAKER_03: That was a locatable thing we actually forgot.
SPEAKER_04: Well, I thought you'd kind of said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the TV.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Shall I just prepare one now?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I would be right too.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So, be attractive to look at.
SPEAKER_04: That's this one.
SPEAKER_04: What do you all say?
SPEAKER_03: Seven or something, the maximum, yeah?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I go for seven.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's terribly good.
SPEAKER_04: We're also proud of the palette.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So, that'll be a seven.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, no, you can't walk.
SPEAKER_04: That's up there.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: What I've done on the next page is I've set it up.
SPEAKER_04: So, we just put the marks in.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Excellent.
SPEAKER_02: Except we can't.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But that's all right.
SPEAKER_02: I can take notes.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I'll take notes.
SPEAKER_04: It's fine.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So, we're all agreeing on seven.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Does it match the operating behavior of the user?
SPEAKER_04: Oh, I think it does.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The only thing that we were considering was that this thing is kind of more for right hundred people than for left hundred people.
SPEAKER_01: So, if you're left hundred, you kind of left.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And we might want to do like another model, another version which is like exactly the mirror image of this one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That's going to be a problem because you don't always have all left-handed or all right-handed in a family.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's not a huge problem because it is a breakable.
SPEAKER_03: But then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway.
SPEAKER_04: So, they just, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: But I mean, because it's not like it's a pen, you know, left-handed people can't normally write, right-handed, but they can normally do most things, right-handed.
SPEAKER_04: Right.
SPEAKER_04: I would say it's not such a big issue.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, because I mean, anyway, right-handed people would be able to start with it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, if you've got majority, right-handed it's-
SPEAKER_04: I mean, you can't mean your finger to scroll other than your thumb. Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So, I mean, that does kind of negate the whole RSI issue.
SPEAKER_04: So, maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation.
SPEAKER_04: I'll give it a five, I would say.
SPEAKER_04: What do you, what do you think?
SPEAKER_03: Or maybe six because it's just one, one, one of them.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think, I mean, most people are right-handed.
SPEAKER_02: So, in terms of our greatest target group, I think it's pretty good.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: One more thing is that- The target for management might want to- Okay.
SPEAKER_01: It might be a little clumsy when it opens up, right?
SPEAKER_01: It opens in the side.
SPEAKER_03: No, yeah, but we have it nicely with a hinge or a wood-hole.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, it won't be a problem, it will be- And it will be- it won't be heavy.
SPEAKER_04: I think the alternative is flippings in the top.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but it's a bit long.
SPEAKER_03: It's a little bit long.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I mean, it can be open like this, of course.
SPEAKER_04: But you were thinking about making it smaller, yeah?
SPEAKER_00: This kind of makes more sense.
SPEAKER_01: So, you have to keep- I have to interfere with the IR channel.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but if we flip it open only as much as that.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So, it works like a mobile phone flipping, but, you know, as long as that side is flat, then that will work.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So, see, are we admitting defeat on sea or are we saying we're going to sticky-locate on the table?
SPEAKER_04: No, we have a look here.
SPEAKER_02: There's a locator.
SPEAKER_02: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: So, that means- I just checked on TV.
SPEAKER_04: That doesn't mean you need to speak on it, though.
SPEAKER_04: Doesn't it?
SPEAKER_04: Let's make it beep.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, well, but the sample speaker is included, so it has some capacity to do- Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: To make some sounds.
SPEAKER_03: So, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So, you see that?
SPEAKER_04: Seven, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So, I'm going to go to the table.
SPEAKER_04: Fabulous day.
SPEAKER_01: Intuitive, completely intuitive.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: If this means intuitive, if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's- Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's-
SPEAKER_02: It's six. Because the- I mean, the standard layout for numbers is three, three, three, and one, rather than the way you've got it.
SPEAKER_02: I really like the way you have it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's not the immediate thing that you're used to.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I mean- And even the scroll- It's a new technology, so it might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginning.
SPEAKER_01: So, it is kind of not very intuitive, but it's a good technology.
SPEAKER_02: But it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So, should we maybe say a five and say it is intuitive, but it's different.
SPEAKER_04: So, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Do you know, I mean, it's obvious how to use it, but you might have to think about it first.
SPEAKER_04: So, we give that one a five, do you think?
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I'm glad you're accepting this.
SPEAKER_04: I have taken a little while, haven't it?
SPEAKER_04: Intuitive.
SPEAKER_04: But- Sorry, it's really hard to write on this.
None: I just went a bit mad.
None: Okay.
None: Cool.
None: E.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: I guess this comes back from this whole beat.
SPEAKER_04: Links in here.
SPEAKER_04: So, possibly for left-handed.
None: Investigate.
SPEAKER_04: Yep.
SPEAKER_02: But otherwise it's superb.
SPEAKER_02: So, she give it a six.
SPEAKER_04: Six.
SPEAKER_04: Six.
SPEAKER_03: The agronomic design, well, I mean, I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, the repetitive stress things, but then who would be really pushing the button so much on the remote control anyway?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Unless you are all the time sitting.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, it's kind of- Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I think it is a text today.
SPEAKER_04: You know, and I never got prepared in Australia, and I enjoy from that.
SPEAKER_04: So, I find it quite hard to believe.
SPEAKER_01: And moreover, it has LCD and everything so that we minimize the pressing of the buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So, we give that a six.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: F.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That's awesome.
SPEAKER_03: Absolutely.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know how to make showing up with the things there, but it only has bullet points there.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, that's the second one.
SPEAKER_02: So, you must have changed it on this one where it's got score, but not on the previous slide.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_04: Cool.
SPEAKER_04: Right.
SPEAKER_04: It has voice control.
SPEAKER_04: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: That's a seven, man.
SPEAKER_01: The most sophisticated mode that I've ever seen.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But in terms of the actual technology, none of it is actually new.
SPEAKER_03: We have the sample speakers as well.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, all of the components have been used in other things before.
SPEAKER_03: But at the same time, they all relatively new.
SPEAKER_04: They've never been using remote control before any link.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: What do you reckon?
SPEAKER_04: Five, six.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: What do you think?
SPEAKER_03: Six.
SPEAKER_03: Six.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, how far can you go with a remote control?
SPEAKER_03: Really?
SPEAKER_03: Well, that's it.
SPEAKER_03: It still has to do with what it has to do.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: But I mean, everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really, haven't it?
SPEAKER_04: See?
SPEAKER_04: I don't think many of you have space remote.
SPEAKER_02: They can take you to put fashion in electronics.
SPEAKER_02: Absolutely.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Isn't it special?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, sure.
SPEAKER_01: The Carrick banana.
SPEAKER_01: It's the maximum fashion.
SPEAKER_03: We give it through the vegetables with our fashionable base days.
SPEAKER_03: There we go.
SPEAKER_04: So I think we've done very well.
SPEAKER_03: Very good.
SPEAKER_04: We need the average here.
SPEAKER_04: So you go...
SPEAKER_03: The average is about six and something.
SPEAKER_03: A little bit over six.
SPEAKER_03: Seven.
SPEAKER_03: There are how many?
SPEAKER_03: No, wait.
SPEAKER_04: A little bit under six.
SPEAKER_04: Twenty-eight.
SPEAKER_04: Three-sixes.
SPEAKER_04: And one-five.
SPEAKER_04: Eighteen.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, three-sixes.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Thirty-eight.
SPEAKER_01: Thirty-eight.
SPEAKER_01: Four-sevenes.
SPEAKER_01: Forty-six and five.
SPEAKER_01: Six point.
SPEAKER_03: Twenty-one.
SPEAKER_02: Twenty-one.
SPEAKER_02: Five.
SPEAKER_02: That's six point five.
SPEAKER_02: Six point five.
SPEAKER_04: Close enough.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: That's pretty good, I think.
SPEAKER_02: I'll wait until we get to finance the money.
SPEAKER_02: If we can afford it.
SPEAKER_02: That's all you've got at the moment.
SPEAKER_02: Did you have anything there?
SPEAKER_02: No, that's it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: So finance.
SPEAKER_02: And we'll see if we can...
SPEAKER_02: Unscrew this test.
SPEAKER_04: Cool side.
SPEAKER_04: So, I think we're going to just take...
SPEAKER_04: There we go.
SPEAKER_04: There we go.
None: Another mark.
SPEAKER_02: Beautiful.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Not anymore.
SPEAKER_02: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: You have to wait for it.
None: There we go.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And now we have to calculate the production costs.
SPEAKER_02: So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that.
SPEAKER_02: Can you read that?
SPEAKER_02: Almost.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, that's...
SPEAKER_02: I started feeling it in.
SPEAKER_02: But of course, these are provisional, so we have to go down.
SPEAKER_02: No hand dynamo, right?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: One simple battery.
SPEAKER_02: No kinetic energy, no solar.
SPEAKER_02: The chip we're going for an advanced chip on print.
SPEAKER_02: We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker.
SPEAKER_02: Yep.
SPEAKER_02: Single curved surface, so that we can unfold with this case material.
SPEAKER_02: This material was said rubber.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what special colour means.
SPEAKER_01: Anything which is not one of those.
SPEAKER_03: I think this is probably special colour.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but rubber comes colour.
SPEAKER_02: I would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood colour.
SPEAKER_03: Or maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing.
SPEAKER_04: Let's leave it as well.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, you might end up having to take off.
SPEAKER_02: So we have screw wheel with push pattern.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we have for muting.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And we have LC display and buttons, supplements.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: No.
None: No.
SPEAKER_03: We don't know.
SPEAKER_01: We don't know.
SPEAKER_03: We don't know.
SPEAKER_03: We don't know.
SPEAKER_03: We don't know.
SPEAKER_03: We don't know.
SPEAKER_02: We don't know.
SPEAKER_02: We don't know.
SPEAKER_02: I think maybe it's integrated with the LC display.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, let's see.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, well, we want a push button.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I think the push button...
SPEAKER_02: So then you have...
SPEAKER_04: I don't know if that's one.
SPEAKER_04: That means you can only have 25 push buttons in total, in that not counting anything.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Still be in budget.
SPEAKER_01: That seems unlucky.
SPEAKER_02: What is the limit?
SPEAKER_02: Whether push button means that we have to count all the colours.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01: No, it says what is the kind of interface.
SPEAKER_01: If it is push button, then you get a 0.5, it's a scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: So we put its push button and scroll wheel and LCC display.
SPEAKER_01: So that's the three kind of interfaces that we have.
SPEAKER_02: So as we can see, that's way too expensive.
SPEAKER_02: What's our strategy?
SPEAKER_02: Some are budget, so 12.5.
SPEAKER_04: The sample center will have to go because that's the most expensive thing.
SPEAKER_02: So that has implications for the...
SPEAKER_01: It does not have four voice recognition, but it does have for the feedback speaker.
SPEAKER_01: When you press one, it says hello.
SPEAKER_04: That's a bit of a gimmick anyway.
SPEAKER_01: And the locator also goes away.
SPEAKER_03: But it was very innovative.
SPEAKER_03: So we're innovating this.
SPEAKER_03: Well, this sample speaker is expensive, but we could just have some very easy device that just beeps.
SPEAKER_02: Because the sample speaker was, I think, more complicated than it would be.
SPEAKER_03: There you record your samples.
SPEAKER_01: Also, in the case, I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface, because it's just rubber.
SPEAKER_01: So it's probably a flat surface rubber.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: So we need 150 off.
SPEAKER_04: See, I was going to say the scroll wheel push button thing,
SPEAKER_02: because take it down to just a scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: So that would mean that we cannot press. Then we would be in level project.
SPEAKER_01: If in the LCD we can scroll, right?
SPEAKER_01: How do we make a selection if you cannot push it?
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no, you can push this one, but we don't have a push button.
SPEAKER_03: We don't have this muting mechanism for this scroll.
SPEAKER_04: But that's where you just have to just put it down.
SPEAKER_02: You can have to scroll it straight down.
SPEAKER_02: So that's point three.
SPEAKER_01: But hey, it's the scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and push button thing.
SPEAKER_03: But I mean, we can put an additional mute button on the top as well.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I mean, that wouldn't actually cost anymore.
SPEAKER_04: That's the spin wheel, though, isn't it?
SPEAKER_04: That can be the LCD.
SPEAKER_02: That comes with the LCD?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We decided because it's not on our list.
SPEAKER_01: So this is...
SPEAKER_02: The scroll wheel is on the side.
SPEAKER_01: So we are adding costs for both of them, right?
SPEAKER_01: Okay, I mean, I think it's the good.
SPEAKER_02: So we're point three over over at the moment.
SPEAKER_04: And then we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have push button to the volume.
SPEAKER_04: You can still put them on the side.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I mean, the scroll wheel is pretty cool, but...
SPEAKER_01: Instead of scrolling here, we have two buttons here, off or up and down.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Sounds good, actually.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, rather than having three different things that people have to do.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: There we go.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, look, we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll get bonuses.
SPEAKER_04: And we could admit to the single curve in the circle, could we?
SPEAKER_02: Or that we have to have some sort of special colour.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So that's all right.
SPEAKER_02: We'll leave it at that.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And then I'll take it back to management and say, we weren't quite sure about the colour of that cost extra, that we've still got some space for it.
SPEAKER_02: We have, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Excellent.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: So did we lose on our evaluation criteria?
SPEAKER_02: Is that a little bit of a problem?
SPEAKER_02: No, I'm not really, you know.
SPEAKER_01: Because we keep all the features, we keep voice recognition, we keep LCD display.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Instead of having scrolling, we just put...
SPEAKER_01: We just got rid of a gimmick that we never know anyway.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: And the scroll wheel is, I mean, essentially the two buttons.
SPEAKER_04: That is not very different.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: All right.
SPEAKER_01: But we lose the locator.
SPEAKER_03: We don't have a beep.
SPEAKER_03: We are going to have a beeping thing.
SPEAKER_00: So instead of speaker.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's not like sample speaker, but it will just beep.
SPEAKER_03: So we still have the locator.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_04: That's not a very exciting colour.
SPEAKER_04: I think you should make it more vegetable-like.
SPEAKER_03: Much colour, the colour of the phone or the colour of the...
SPEAKER_04: Oh, the beeper thing.
SPEAKER_03: It can be yellow as well.
SPEAKER_03: It can come in the same colour as the case.
SPEAKER_02: We won't have run out of our pocket later.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think General wants it to vibrate.
SPEAKER_04: You know, your pen vibrates.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I know.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but I don't think it's a very short time.
SPEAKER_02: OK.
SPEAKER_02: So it looks like we designed a banana.
SPEAKER_02: We've just got about ten minutes or so left at the meeting.
SPEAKER_02: So it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went.
SPEAKER_02: So that we can feed back to the management for the next time they designed the product.
SPEAKER_02: Cool.
SPEAKER_02: Feedback, I do.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I'm as far as creativity is concerned.
SPEAKER_03: I think that was wrong for creativity.
SPEAKER_03: The only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the budget we had.
SPEAKER_01: I think one thing that was lacking was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And we kept adding things randomly.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So, how do you know?
SPEAKER_04: If we had the beginning, we should have been like, OK, we can have that a lot.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we can see what we can.
SPEAKER_01: So all the random decisions at the end could have been entered.
SPEAKER_02: But in terms of the process of going and working individually and then coming back to the meeting, that works.
SPEAKER_04: I think it would mean to say regular, you know, it wasn't like we were alone for very long.
SPEAKER_04: So you didn't go off and think, wouldn't it be great to have a bomb rating?
SPEAKER_00: I would have a big drop.
SPEAKER_04: Shape like a banana.
SPEAKER_04: And then, you know, you come back three days later and you're like, look, if I've been waiting, it's like a banana.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, the means were very, very good.
SPEAKER_03: The means we used the whiteboard digital pen.
SPEAKER_04: I like the pens.
SPEAKER_04: And I think it's the only one that would just be so cool to do.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, he could take it to lecture and just write stuff down.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I wonder what one of these costs.
SPEAKER_04: Do you think I've noticed if one may?
SPEAKER_04: Maybe you should see that was the recording.
SPEAKER_04: OK.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But that worked well having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the power point.
SPEAKER_02: I find that the problem with power point often is that it's so static and you can't change it once.
SPEAKER_02: It is a bit weird.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And this time also, the time limits that actually preparing the...
SPEAKER_04: Nothing flew in.
SPEAKER_04: You didn't have the whole swoosh-ing thing because it wasn't time for that.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: That's all right.
SPEAKER_04: But always it would.
SPEAKER_04: Not that you can do that on the board either.
SPEAKER_04: It would make some...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but I mean, already just preparing the slides before the whole day.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I mean, now it's fairly tight anyway.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, especially with that last minute alteration.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: You can see any brackets.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: This is just hard to be changed.
SPEAKER_04: And yeah.
SPEAKER_04: It's a cool thing.
SPEAKER_04: We're supposed to say nice things about Jen.
SPEAKER_04: I'm pushing.
SPEAKER_04: You know, moving's a nasty thing.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I was satisfied with my leadership.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: You won't like it addictating you, that's always good.
SPEAKER_02: You have to say that because I'm taking the next clip.
SPEAKER_02: And then you've got the pen.
SPEAKER_04: What time do you think?
SPEAKER_03: And then the teamwork, I think it works quite nicely.
SPEAKER_02: Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to express them?
SPEAKER_01: I guess it was a fairly small group.
SPEAKER_01: So all of us got to express our opinions.
SPEAKER_03: Well, it's a pretty new, pretty novel solution for most control really.
SPEAKER_03: All this flipping open thing.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: I don't think you're shopping for my control.
SPEAKER_03: But I've never seen anything.
SPEAKER_03: And none of my examples were like this.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I'll be looking at how many people are next.
SPEAKER_04: I'll be exploring.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe we could have a patent on this one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Patent patents.
SPEAKER_04: I think we'd like to think the idea is we need, but we've got no way of finding it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You can always go to Google and type in banana remote control.
SPEAKER_02: I can't even worry.
SPEAKER_04: I've just came up with like a thing to learn.
SPEAKER_02: True.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So costs are within budget.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Within budget.
SPEAKER_02: Including a little, what have we got?
SPEAKER_02: One euro left over.
SPEAKER_02: It fits that we didn't possibly.
SPEAKER_02: We've evaluated.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: A project.
SPEAKER_02: And you've got the scores.
SPEAKER_02: Can you put that in the project documents?
SPEAKER_02: It's in the project.
SPEAKER_02: And the process we all didn't really have any major problems with.
SPEAKER_02: Was there anything that you found difficult or anything that didn't go as smoothly?
SPEAKER_03: One way difficult was the time pressure.
SPEAKER_04: Otherwise.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Sometimes it's like a little bit less.
SPEAKER_01: I thought that was good though because if you're given too much time, then you've got nothing to do with your time.
SPEAKER_01: Although we could have made the Rs better how we have time.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I think we're still there within a...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We've got about five minutes left.
SPEAKER_02: But if we're finished, then we're finished.
SPEAKER_02: Which is too efficient.
SPEAKER_02: We should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: So I would say that's the end of that meeting.
SPEAKER_02: It's a pleasure working with you.
SPEAKER_02: It was very productive day.
SPEAKER_04: And four animals on the board again.
None: Oh no.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_03: It can make some animals.
SPEAKER_03: Are you dead, why?
SPEAKER_04: No.
SPEAKER_04: It's just me and it smells so bad.
SPEAKER_03: That's it?
SPEAKER_03: It smells quite nice.
SPEAKER_03: It smells very sweet.
SPEAKER_02: So we have to complete the final question here, meeting summary when they...
SPEAKER_02: Is there a question I've already sent?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if it's already sent or not.
SPEAKER_02: No, it was a bit.
SPEAKER_02: I'm pushing over there.
SPEAKER_04: Do we have to go back into the other room or put this thing in?
SPEAKER_02: I don't see why we can't stay here really.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, it's moving.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if you can say this thing.
SPEAKER_02: I'm glad.
SPEAKER_03: I made your animal for you.
SPEAKER_03: It was supposed to be pink.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but it was blue.
None: It was blue.
