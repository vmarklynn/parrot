None: you you you you you you you N as It's the same as on the top of it with the round like this one.
SPEAKER_01: But we do think it's what it is for.
SPEAKER_01: Which prefers the customer.
SPEAKER_03: I think this is the device which has a learning curve.
SPEAKER_03: Not for users.
SPEAKER_03: Users device as normal users use remote control.
SPEAKER_03: And after a while they start to develop some skills in the voice recognition functions.
SPEAKER_03: And then they will not use this dial as often.
SPEAKER_03: But other users who are new to this device need something like that.
SPEAKER_03: They need to understand how to change channels and change the volume.
SPEAKER_03: So it's easier for them.
SPEAKER_05: Could I see this crowbar as a sort of shortcut?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah maybe so.
SPEAKER_05: And voice recognition as well.
SPEAKER_05: Maybe you could.
SPEAKER_03: Wow it's another approach.
SPEAKER_03: It's more that are as I feel back in the room.
SPEAKER_03: There are many ways of doing things on such a device.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: It's quite easy.
SPEAKER_05: Okay good.
SPEAKER_05: And the case is rubber.
SPEAKER_03: Yes rubber.
SPEAKER_05: And the buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Plastic or rubber.
SPEAKER_03: Plastic or rubber.
SPEAKER_05: Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: And the coloring yellow with gray or black.
SPEAKER_03: Or something like that.
SPEAKER_03: Whatever cost the least.
SPEAKER_05: Okay we'll come to that later.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Anything else to add or?
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe we should think about these buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Or you could use two of them to program the channels on the two channel button.
SPEAKER_03: But these are tasks that are only executed once I think.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: But maybe you do want to program buttons to for example activate the voice recognition or train the voice recognition.
SPEAKER_03: Oh okay.
SPEAKER_01: That's right.
SPEAKER_01: Or something on the button for disabling the voice recognition.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah although by pressing the button for I don't know two or three seconds you could also say you disable it with a little beep.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Okay that's not really really important.
SPEAKER_01: This is the basic idea.
SPEAKER_01: The basic.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: For prototype.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: You thought of some evaluation criteria?
SPEAKER_05: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
None: My name is not the name.
SPEAKER_04: You are nameless.
SPEAKER_05: You are nameless.
SPEAKER_04: Well I use the earlier documents.
SPEAKER_04: And these are the most important criteria.
SPEAKER_04: That's how the fashion guy is stated.
SPEAKER_04: Fancy look and feel.
SPEAKER_01: So just walk through it step by step.
SPEAKER_01: I mean it's fancy.
SPEAKER_01: Everything I believe.
SPEAKER_01: I believe it's fancy.
SPEAKER_04: I believe it's fancy too.
SPEAKER_04: But apparently we shouldn't evaluate it yet.
SPEAKER_04: Oh.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So these are the criteria.
SPEAKER_04: I think these are the most important criteria.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Well.
SPEAKER_05: So that's about it.
SPEAKER_05: Then we'll switch to my presentation.
SPEAKER_05: The prediction costs.
SPEAKER_05: The costs are not under.
SPEAKER_05: Can I?
SPEAKER_05: Aww.
SPEAKER_05: This is the.
SPEAKER_04: 22.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: It's way above the 12 year of 50.
SPEAKER_05: And what makes it very expensive is for example the solar cell.
SPEAKER_05: So I guess we should skip that because it's not that important.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: What is the price?
SPEAKER_01: And the price.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: The number of items and the sum.
SPEAKER_05: Well this is what I would call our luxury model.
SPEAKER_05: If you look at the what we could do to make it more to make it just between the 12 year of 50 then I did the following changes.
SPEAKER_05: 12 euro 40 cents I came up with by leaving out solar cells by not using the voice recognition feature because it's a four euro addition to the price.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: I believe.
SPEAKER_05: Push button.
None: Well.
SPEAKER_05: It makes it 13.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Push buttons are not the most expensive but do at extra cost.
SPEAKER_05: So yeah this design is not within our price model.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: But I'm afraid it's not complete because we use special materials.
SPEAKER_03: The last item.
SPEAKER_03: You have not added one item there.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So it's way too expensive.
SPEAKER_05: It's still too expensive.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But that's only for the buttons.
SPEAKER_05: I guess if we leave the if we leave this one out.
SPEAKER_05: And maybe not use a special form.
SPEAKER_01: And a plus and just plus button.
SPEAKER_01: So instead of rubber.
SPEAKER_05: It becomes a very dull remote control.
SPEAKER_05: I know.
SPEAKER_05: But it's the board decision.
SPEAKER_05: And yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Well basically when this is our only option we should even consider changing the casing because I think there's very little added value in an enhanced case with these dual functions.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: I know maybe we should look at a focus on another type of movement.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Not all that fancy but just way way more easy.
SPEAKER_05: Basic.
SPEAKER_05: Yes.
SPEAKER_05: And maximize the profit.
SPEAKER_03: And that's maybe that's better.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe we could we should go for straight and simple.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But that's not what has been asked.
SPEAKER_05: I know.
SPEAKER_03: I know.
SPEAKER_03: So we should kick the boards.
SPEAKER_03: Well.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Although I think we could still make a remote control that applies more to young people by giving it another color already.
SPEAKER_05: So it is possible to make a device that attracts a little bit more to young people.
SPEAKER_05: Yes.
SPEAKER_05: But I agree it's not a fancy high tech device.
SPEAKER_05: Definitely not.
SPEAKER_05: It's not that innovative or however you pronounce that.
SPEAKER_05: So, okay.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, this is the wrong one.
SPEAKER_05: So that means redesign.
SPEAKER_05: We do not have the time now to redesign the product.
SPEAKER_05: But we can evaluate the process and the satisfaction on how things went.
SPEAKER_05: I'm not sure if we need to evaluate the device first.
SPEAKER_05: I guess.
SPEAKER_04: Well, since we're not going to manufacture it anyway.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: That's true.
SPEAKER_03: Well, maybe it's good to do it anyway.
SPEAKER_03: Because if we can also determine if our objectives are good.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So.
SPEAKER_05: I agree.
SPEAKER_05: Well.
SPEAKER_03: Is it fancy?
SPEAKER_03: It is.
SPEAKER_05: It is.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I think it's a rubber.
SPEAKER_05: You like the rubber at all.
SPEAKER_03: I'm into it.
SPEAKER_03: So, one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That's not that fancy.
SPEAKER_05: No, I'll give it a two.
SPEAKER_03: I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing.
SPEAKER_03: The casing.
SPEAKER_03: It would be.
SPEAKER_03: You like that.
SPEAKER_03: I'm into it.
SPEAKER_05: That's a flavor as well.
SPEAKER_03: It has flavor.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, that's right.
SPEAKER_03: But you taste it.
SPEAKER_04: Right.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, I know.
SPEAKER_05: But that's fancy in the way.
SPEAKER_05: I mean, fancy has a lot of.
SPEAKER_03: It has to do with fashion, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So, do we.
SPEAKER_04: It's trendy.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: What they wanted was colors and soft materials.
SPEAKER_04: So, in that way.
SPEAKER_05: It applies.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's fancy.
SPEAKER_01: I'll just give it a two.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's not the ultimate thing.
SPEAKER_03: It's not the ultimate thing.
SPEAKER_03: It's not the ultimate thing.
SPEAKER_03: It's not the ultimate thing.
SPEAKER_03: But I would have been more fancy by using the double curved case.
SPEAKER_03: It would have been even more fancy.
SPEAKER_03: But we decided not to because if we use double.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but that's the case.
SPEAKER_03: We couldn't use solar.
SPEAKER_01: So looking at the user needs, we only don't have the double curved case.
SPEAKER_01: We do have the rubber.
SPEAKER_01: We do have the colors.
SPEAKER_01: There's two out of three.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: So, I believe we're close to two.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I agree.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, I agree.
SPEAKER_03: It's okay.
SPEAKER_03: We did good.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, we did good.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: And what is it?
SPEAKER_04: Inevitive.
SPEAKER_05: Well, with the voice recognition feature.
SPEAKER_03: And it's over.
SPEAKER_03: Or can we?
SPEAKER_03: No, we are evaluating this design now.
SPEAKER_05: This prototype.
SPEAKER_03: I think it is.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's innovative.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: In the scroll wheel, the solar, not many remotes have the solar, I think.
SPEAKER_03: It could have been a little bit more innovative by using the kinetic energy source.
SPEAKER_03: But it's what it would have been a thrill.
SPEAKER_04: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: Also, I think it's a two.
SPEAKER_04: Is it easy to use?
SPEAKER_05: I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_05: I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_01: Well, yeah, the voice recognition, of course, is hard to learn, I think.
SPEAKER_01: Well, hard.
SPEAKER_01: It's not for the elderly.
SPEAKER_03: They won't use it.
SPEAKER_03: There are two parts in this remote control.
SPEAKER_03: What you see here is the basic part.
SPEAKER_03: Everybody can use it.
SPEAKER_03: So that's easy to use.
SPEAKER_03: That's for another user.
SPEAKER_03: When you have a more advanced level of users, well, such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions.
SPEAKER_03: In that way, it is advanced.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's easy to use for both types of users.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's not very easy for you.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's free.
SPEAKER_05: Wouldn't give it more.
SPEAKER_05: I'm doubting as well.
SPEAKER_04: The most important function is easy to use.
SPEAKER_04: The zapping, channel switching, volume.
SPEAKER_04: But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Two or three, what would be your guess?
SPEAKER_05: I mean, ease of use does not only apply to the most basic functions.
SPEAKER_05: It's overall.
SPEAKER_05: It's the device easy to use.
SPEAKER_03: That's right.
SPEAKER_03: You're right in that.
SPEAKER_03: But I guess an advanced user will find the voice recognition function easy to use.
SPEAKER_03: Because he is already, she is already an advanced user.
SPEAKER_03: Personally, I would give it two.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: At all, three.
None: Yeah.
None: Good question.
SPEAKER_04: I'll go for the two.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Two, two, and three.
SPEAKER_03: Two-free.
SPEAKER_03: So I could make it easy.
SPEAKER_03: So that will be three in general.
SPEAKER_03: No, two and a half.
SPEAKER_03: If you make a four.
SPEAKER_03: No, six and four.
SPEAKER_03: Six and four is ten.
SPEAKER_03: And by four is two and a half.
SPEAKER_03: So darn.
SPEAKER_03: May.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: But all.
SPEAKER_03: Seven, three.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: Four and a three together.
SPEAKER_03: Four.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You have a two.
SPEAKER_01: Two, three.
SPEAKER_01: Three.
SPEAKER_01: No, I haven't said anything yet.
SPEAKER_01: May.
SPEAKER_05: I know.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: But if I would say a three, then it's six and four is ten.
SPEAKER_01: Divided by four.
SPEAKER_05: Divided by four is two.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: If you want to have the conclusion as a three, then you would make a four.
SPEAKER_01: If you fill out a four.
SPEAKER_05: But I'm filling in a three, so it will be a 2.5.
SPEAKER_03: But that's not possible to fill in.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, it is.
SPEAKER_05: So we have to run.
SPEAKER_05: I have a veto.
SPEAKER_05: Exactly.
SPEAKER_05: It's not about the content.
SPEAKER_05: It's about...
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Is it easy to find?
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, definitely.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we haven't really worked it out, but it most doesn't...
SPEAKER_01: You can just say find and he repeats find.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, or beeps or...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but that's the basic idea of the speaker.
SPEAKER_01: I think.
SPEAKER_03: I'm here.
SPEAKER_03: I'm here.
SPEAKER_03: Something like that.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe you have to program it once to let it respond to a certain word or a sentence and something like...
SPEAKER_03: Even without it.
SPEAKER_03: Where are you?
SPEAKER_03: And then it will sing, I'm here.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So something like that.
SPEAKER_05: We should not stay too long on this subject because of the time.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: But I personally give it a one.
SPEAKER_05: Sebastian?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, me too.
SPEAKER_03: Me too.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, I think.
SPEAKER_05: Right.
SPEAKER_05: Well, the feel of remote control is spongy.
SPEAKER_05: Well, it can't be more spongy.
SPEAKER_03: Well, it can be.
SPEAKER_03: There are cases in which the outside casing can be...
SPEAKER_03: Is this one of our...
SPEAKER_03: One of our options.
SPEAKER_03: No, it's not one of our options.
SPEAKER_03: No, okay.
SPEAKER_03: This is when you're looking at the market.
SPEAKER_05: For your options given, it's the most points you want.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, but that's not what they're talking about, I think, because we compare all these characteristics with markets, with the real market.
SPEAKER_03: So there are remote controls out there, which are a lot more spongy.
SPEAKER_03: They're out there.
SPEAKER_03: In this case, we've done the best we could.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: But it's not good enough, so it's a tool.
SPEAKER_05: I'll give it a one.
SPEAKER_03: I'll take one.
SPEAKER_03: You'll take one?
SPEAKER_03: What do you give it?
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah, it depends, because it's the most spongy we can...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, I know, but you have to name it, because we need to go on for the time.
SPEAKER_04: Well, if I give it a one, it will be a one- No, we want health calculations.
SPEAKER_04: So I'll just give it a two and make this a 1.5.
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no.
SPEAKER_03: I'll change it.
SPEAKER_03: I'll make it...
SPEAKER_03: My mark will be a four.
SPEAKER_05: You are...
SPEAKER_05: Okay, the remote control offers enough features.
SPEAKER_05: Well, Root, what do you think about it?
SPEAKER_04: Well, the basic layout doesn't offer much, but the voice recognition could add a lot.
None: So...
SPEAKER_03: Basically, it's completely programmable.
SPEAKER_03: You can add very much functionality by using the voice recognition mode.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I know.
SPEAKER_03: It's quite a sense.
SPEAKER_03: What we didn't talk about is...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but it doesn't have the digits.
SPEAKER_01: I believe it's...
SPEAKER_01: If you ask yourself, it offers enough features, I don't think it has all the features a normal remote has.
SPEAKER_05: I think it has.
SPEAKER_04: It depends on what you implement.
SPEAKER_05: Plus we didn't talk about it, but you do have remote controls that are able to adapt another signal.
SPEAKER_05: So you place a regular remote control in front of the other one, hit the one or the two or the three, whatever, and it records the series...
SPEAKER_05: The signals.
SPEAKER_05: The signals.
SPEAKER_05: So you could enter any comment you like.
SPEAKER_05: As long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal.
SPEAKER_05: So I think this is remote control with very high level features.
SPEAKER_05: Absolutely.
SPEAKER_05: Although there are a few buttons, but the inside is quite...
SPEAKER_03: That's it.
SPEAKER_03: Power, I guess.
SPEAKER_03: Because a regular programmable remote control contains, well, really a lot of buttons, at least 40 buttons.
SPEAKER_03: So it's quite complicated to get used to.
SPEAKER_03: And this is quite simple.
SPEAKER_03: You can use your voice to program it.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Let's give it a number.
SPEAKER_05: I'll give it a one.
SPEAKER_05: For this type of market, I think it's a one.
SPEAKER_01: I'll give it a two.
SPEAKER_03: I'll give it a one.
SPEAKER_04: I think a one, because with the voice recognition you could add anything you want.
SPEAKER_04: That's like...
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: I think we've succeeded in developing a product that's actually quite good, but not for this kind of market and not for this kind of price.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So high quality, low acceptance.
SPEAKER_05: The product has high quality and is advanced, but whether or not our clients are willing to pay 25 euros for this kind of device is not sure.
SPEAKER_05: Do you agree?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, I agree.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, even because it doesn't look advanced.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Maybe we should have a radar function.
SPEAKER_01: Couldn't...
SPEAKER_01: What's the selling price?
SPEAKER_01: 50?
SPEAKER_01: 25 euros.
SPEAKER_01: 25.
SPEAKER_01: And costs were 12.50.
SPEAKER_01: But even now, if only our production costs were exceeded, the double, I think, production costs were 22.
SPEAKER_01: So selling price would be about 50 euros.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That's quite expensive.
SPEAKER_03: It's not very expensive for remote control that...
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: It has this functional remote control of any TV kind, a Philips remote control.
SPEAKER_03: You pay more than 50 euros.
SPEAKER_03: It's quite expensive.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And I know from a few years ago, it was a hundred kilos.
SPEAKER_05: Well, yeah, I know.
SPEAKER_05: But you're paying for the brand because there are remote controls which control your stereo, television, DVD, CD player.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: 25 euros.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, but you can learn this thing, all these functions.
SPEAKER_03: And it's easier to use because those remote consoles don't offer voice recognition.
SPEAKER_03: This one does.
SPEAKER_03: So I think it's worth its price.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: You had an overall rating.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but...
SPEAKER_04: That's counting.
SPEAKER_04: These ratings.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Well, it's about...
SPEAKER_03: It should be about 1.15.
SPEAKER_03: So something like that.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: We'll go further on with the rest of the evaluation.
SPEAKER_05: About the project itself, not about the product.
SPEAKER_05: What did you think about the process, the project process?
SPEAKER_02: Ruth.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Try to translate that.
SPEAKER_00: Any other...
SPEAKER_05: I think...
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: The process was good.
SPEAKER_01: But we weren't aware of the prices of the cost.
SPEAKER_01: And that was in the big deal.
SPEAKER_01: If we knew that before, actually we could have made the choice between...
SPEAKER_01: Better decisions.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We had too little information actually.
SPEAKER_03: And while looking at room for creativity, the choice of components was way too narrow.
SPEAKER_03: So that was not really a process of...
SPEAKER_05: So we could have been creative, but it was tempered by the choice of components and...
SPEAKER_05: Yes, the price.
SPEAKER_03: The price.
SPEAKER_03: Well, in the first meeting, we already were very creative.
SPEAKER_03: We thought of possibilities who are not possible with the occurrence or of manufacturing components.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We're tempered by that, yes.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, rule.
SPEAKER_05: Any other thoughts on that?
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_05: No.
SPEAKER_05: Ruth.
SPEAKER_05: I agree.
SPEAKER_05: You agree.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Leadership.
SPEAKER_03: Fantastic.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Rules on for his promotion.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Is it okay?
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I think we're a good team.
SPEAKER_05: I think so too.
SPEAKER_05: It's, of course, a laboratory environment.
SPEAKER_05: I missed it to be able to contact you in between.
SPEAKER_05: And say, I'll...
SPEAKER_05: I tried once, but it was not allowed.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, but...
SPEAKER_05: When taking in account the situation, I think we performed pretty well.
SPEAKER_05: I think so too.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: The means.
SPEAKER_05: The smart board, the digital pen, did you like them?
SPEAKER_03: The digital pen was okay, but the smart board was really bad.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Because of the response or...
SPEAKER_03: The response is very slow and the possibilities are very limited.
SPEAKER_03: It's not accurate.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: It has... yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's not accurate.
SPEAKER_01: The pointing of the pen is not the place where it writes...
SPEAKER_01: Where it draws?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, where it draws.
SPEAKER_03: It's the drawing on the board is right from the pen.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So it had to be...
SPEAKER_05: You have to take that line.
SPEAKER_03: There are lines.
SPEAKER_03: Or what's the word?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Maybe it needs to be calibrated.
SPEAKER_05: It was calibrated just before this means.
SPEAKER_05: The one before the third meeting.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So it's not the calibration.
SPEAKER_05: It's the thing itself.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: I think.
SPEAKER_05: Ruit, did you use the pen a lot?
SPEAKER_05: Not at all.
SPEAKER_05: Not at all.
SPEAKER_05: Not really?
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: I thought it was quite a handy thing.
SPEAKER_05: I think so too.
SPEAKER_05: Although I would like to see OCR.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: If it has OCR, I think I would use...
SPEAKER_01: I just took notes for myself and that's it.
SPEAKER_01: It was necessary for me to...
SPEAKER_05: To digitize them.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Because if I want something on the computer, I just typed it.
SPEAKER_01: I typed faster than the other right.
SPEAKER_03: But I think it's a great solution for a gnome problem.
SPEAKER_03: Writing down some notes, some information.
SPEAKER_03: And then forgetting your notebook somewhere.
SPEAKER_03: And losing all that information.
SPEAKER_03: Because you have everything in one place.
SPEAKER_03: And it's quite easy, quite easy.
SPEAKER_03: It's possible to make this information digital.
SPEAKER_03: I share it with others.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Quite easy way.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's a good product.
SPEAKER_03: I only think the shape of the pen is too big.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's not quite an anomis.
SPEAKER_03: Economic.
SPEAKER_03: Er-genomis.
SPEAKER_02: I know.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Erm...
None: What...
SPEAKER_05: Ruit, what did you think about the smart boards?
SPEAKER_04: Oh, I only use it to draw a rabbit.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: You can't really decide.
SPEAKER_05: I missed a feature to easily select a slide and distribute it to the laptops.
SPEAKER_05: I think that would be very easy if you could say, okay, I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or...
SPEAKER_04: Or the other way around.
SPEAKER_05: Or the other way around that you could show.
SPEAKER_05: But quite what PowerPoint does.
SPEAKER_01: I know.
SPEAKER_01: If you save this image, you can open it in your shared work folder.
SPEAKER_01: I know.
SPEAKER_01: So it's almost...
SPEAKER_05: I know.
SPEAKER_05: But we couldn't use that feature.
SPEAKER_05: So I missed it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: We weren't able to do that.
SPEAKER_05: At least I wasn't explained how to do such.
SPEAKER_01: You know, and the function of filling an oval or an object.
SPEAKER_03: The drawing...
SPEAKER_02: It's not...
SPEAKER_02: Capabilities are very limited.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And when you're using windows, you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons which you can use for drawing.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And a lot of these buttons don't appear here.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_03: That looks like a paint.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So it's not even as advanced as paint.
SPEAKER_03: Not...
SPEAKER_03: Not...
SPEAKER_03: It's quite limited.
None: Okay.
None: No.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: The project is evaluated.
SPEAKER_05: But, well, we need to redesign the product.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, very good celebration.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_03: It's a...
SPEAKER_01: It's a privilege for working with you.
SPEAKER_05: You're dismissed.
SPEAKER_05: No, I think we are ready.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Two private rooms?
SPEAKER_03: I see some action over there.
SPEAKER_05: Private room, at all.
SPEAKER_05: That sounds quite scary.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Now, let's find out the way to...
SPEAKER_05: They don't want to do this.
None: There.
None: That was...
SPEAKER_02: We're done.
SPEAKER_03: We're finished.
SPEAKER_03: I believe.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_03: Are there any more cycles in this process?
SPEAKER_03: I think not.
SPEAKER_03: I don't believe so.
SPEAKER_05: Well, maybe we get an email.
SPEAKER_05: Thank you for your...
SPEAKER_03: But how much time did we get for this meeting?
SPEAKER_03: Fourteen minutes.
SPEAKER_03: And how much time is left?
SPEAKER_05: A minute or ten, maybe?
SPEAKER_05: Ten minutes.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, ten or five.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So we can redesign our...
SPEAKER_05: I would like to...
SPEAKER_03: Well, I think we all know what the redesign should be.
SPEAKER_03: A simple, built, one-colored box.
SPEAKER_04: No added value.
SPEAKER_03: No, it's just the same product that is already on the market.
SPEAKER_01: You see the problem?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You can continue your line.
SPEAKER_01: Well, it's fluffy, all right?
SPEAKER_01: Spongy.
SPEAKER_03: What is that?
SPEAKER_03: Giraffe.
SPEAKER_03: Giraffe eating leaves from a tree.
SPEAKER_05: It's blue tongue.
SPEAKER_04: Interesting design.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: This is a new model.
SPEAKER_03: So you're actually promoting Bluetooth or blue tongue?
SPEAKER_05: Blue tongue.
SPEAKER_04: But it does have a natural feeling.
SPEAKER_04: So...
SPEAKER_05: It's spongy.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Opa.
SPEAKER_05: That is...
SPEAKER_05: It's a new feature next to Bluetooth to disable all Bluetooth devices.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_03: Let's wrap it up.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: We're done here.
SPEAKER_05: Gentlemen, thank you for your cooperation.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you, Mr. Manager.
SPEAKER_03: Now, let's have a bottle of champagne.
SPEAKER_01: All right. Let's give it here.
SPEAKER_05: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: That's it, mate.
SPEAKER_03: No, it's not.
SPEAKER_05: It's very good.
SPEAKER_05: Mate, it's a microphone.
SPEAKER_05: It's an all-tinger.
None: It's a nice one.
