None: Mr. Big.
None: You still have some minutes left, don't we?
None: Yeah.
None: Or a minute?
None: Sorry.
None: We still have some time left for the meeting.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: One minute.
SPEAKER_03: Like a minute.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Do whatever you want.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, what a lot of other.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
None: Oh, maybe you can display it on the screen.
None: I'm just doing this, sorry.
SPEAKER_02: Nah, this is just about...
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I have some shok over here.
None: It tastes funny.
None: What if you don't?
SPEAKER_02: It's like mixed chocolate milk and coffee or something.
None: Oh, that's good.
None: No, Steve.
None: Picture's mixed after each other in the mouth.
None: Shana pot.
None: Yeah, that would be better.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe easier with open and...
SPEAKER_04: Oh, see.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
None: Did you put it in the chat for a while?
None: Yeah.
None: Oh, we can begin.
None: We have to the meeting room and bring your letter.
None: Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: That's tight too.
None: Welcome to the...
None: Sorry.
None: Yeah.
None: Alright.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe good for a presentation if I just...
None: Not sure if yet.
None: Oh, I see.
None: Okay.
None: But welcome to the fourth meeting, the details design meeting, where we have to reach the session on the details of the remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Presented by your...
SPEAKER_03:...pornomally...
SPEAKER_03:...protic manager.
SPEAKER_03: What we're going to do?
SPEAKER_03: Once again, I'm going to take minutes, so no presentation for me.
SPEAKER_03: First, we have a prototype presentation by G and G.
SPEAKER_03: After what some evaluation criteria...
SPEAKER_03: Evaluation criteria.
SPEAKER_03: Sorry.
SPEAKER_03: Evaluation criteria.
SPEAKER_03: In combination with finance, I received an Excel file, which we have to fill in later on.
SPEAKER_03: You see?
SPEAKER_03: And then we must see if we stay under the 12 and a half euro.
SPEAKER_03: So that's...
SPEAKER_00: That's a bit...
SPEAKER_03: So let's...
SPEAKER_03:...proble.
SPEAKER_03: We have...
SPEAKER_03: We must have some time for that because it will be quite a lot of mathematics.
SPEAKER_03: After that evaluation of the process, how we have done it here with the Smartboard, with our laptops, with all this.
SPEAKER_03: And afterwards, we're closing.
SPEAKER_03: Once again, 40 minutes.
SPEAKER_03: Let's start.
SPEAKER_03: I will give the word to G and G for the prototype.
SPEAKER_03: Presentation.
SPEAKER_04: Presentation.
SPEAKER_04: And then...
SPEAKER_03: Oh, well, sure.
SPEAKER_03: J and J.
SPEAKER_02: J and J.
SPEAKER_02: J and J.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, guys.
SPEAKER_02: Take it away.
SPEAKER_02: Take it away.
None: Tsk.
SPEAKER_04: This was our first concept.
SPEAKER_04: We decided to use a single touchscreen.
SPEAKER_04: So we've worked out these concepts, how to hold it, where to put it, what's this and stuff.
SPEAKER_04: And, well, we began with a form of shape that is easy to hold in one hand, left or right-handed.
SPEAKER_04: So we made it a little bit less thick and have some artistic meaning.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yes, it's not that easy.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, that's better.
SPEAKER_04: Well, during the meeting, I showed you the concept of placing the buttons on top, usable with your thumb, and the menu structure, if necessary, with your other hand.
SPEAKER_04: So it's going to hold it easily, and it has to be accessible with your other hand too, of course.
SPEAKER_04: So we began working our concepts.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, well, as usual, we would just have to basically mode with the panel LCD screen.
SPEAKER_01: Well, these would be the main buttons.
SPEAKER_01: You could change them later on in your own profile if you want to, but, well, the standard will be delivered with this kind of setup, with the more advanced menu sitting right here, with the sub-menus and stuff.
SPEAKER_01: We made a top or front view, just like you want a back view.
SPEAKER_01: As you can see, this is two weird bumps in it.
SPEAKER_01: This is for the added effect of our youth and dynamic, and this is for artistic effect.
SPEAKER_01: Well, what we figured is, we'll show you a picture later on, you'll have a better idea after that, but the idea is to stay in balance with these two.
SPEAKER_01: So when you put it on the table, it will just lay down, it won't roll around and stuff, but it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone, maybe, or like these old phones.
SPEAKER_01: You may get the idea.
SPEAKER_01: So this is about how we figured it should be.
SPEAKER_01: You would hide with some more rubber layers, like we discussed earlier.
SPEAKER_01: You wouldn't see a straight panel, but more fluidly and round.
SPEAKER_04: The panel just, of course, goes like this.
SPEAKER_04: But the overlaying layer is a little bit cursed and stuff.
SPEAKER_01: Okay. And in these bumps, you could actually put some electronics out of which you could make a more thinner design, and that would actually look very nice.
SPEAKER_01: And about the colour.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah, that this can be held with your hands.
SPEAKER_04: So this maximum is one and a half centimeters.
SPEAKER_04: So you have room here for your battery, and maybe even other electronic chips.
SPEAKER_04: So you can just be the layer of the touchscreen and some wires underneath it to make it as clean as possible in the middle for a good, great.
SPEAKER_01: As cutters, do you have a picture in there?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, this is the idea about the bumps.
SPEAKER_01: You can see there's a very youthful dynamic exterior.
SPEAKER_01: You just want to hold it if you were young and dynamic like us.
SPEAKER_02: It's like an Easter egg.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's like, but this is for children, we want a more adult version, but this is like a remote control for children.
SPEAKER_01: It's called a we-mode.
SPEAKER_01: We-mode.
SPEAKER_01: A we-mode, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's actually brilliant. Mark Tingston.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Wait, what I got in mind.
SPEAKER_01: So this is actually basically the idea.
SPEAKER_01: We just want to build a more adult version of this.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I can imagine that.
SPEAKER_01: And for colors, we figured starting with basic colors like white or metallic gray.
SPEAKER_01: Those are the technological colors actually.
SPEAKER_04: It would be best to appeal to a broad public and make the conference exchangeable, so the young people will buy an orange and a red and a blue one.
SPEAKER_04: Sure, but when older people go in the shop and see an orange remote control, it would be less appealing than a white one.
SPEAKER_04: And young people we think are a little bit more flexible.
SPEAKER_04: I'll buy for a couple of euros.
SPEAKER_04: It's a nice hit.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover.
SPEAKER_02: So that you can pick a cover in the shop.
SPEAKER_04: I think a cover is necessary because I'll just have the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_04: There must be some cheap standard cover, maybe white or something that comes with it and you can buy it so we can make it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but you mustn't forget that our target aim is younger people.
SPEAKER_03: We had decided to put some flashy fruit-free colors in it.
SPEAKER_03: And in the surfy from Milan and Paris, it came out that the older people are more willing to spend money on extra futures.
SPEAKER_03: So I think it will be a better idea to have some flashy-free colors as standard for the people who really want a more sophisticated, more traditional look.
SPEAKER_03: They are willing to pay that.
SPEAKER_03: They want more luxury stuff, but they have the money to do it and they want to buy that.
SPEAKER_03: So maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra.
SPEAKER_01: That's a standard.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, perhaps, all right.
SPEAKER_01: I would agree with this sound logical.
SPEAKER_02: Another idea.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe we could develop a cover with wood style.
SPEAKER_02: They would please the elder users as well.
SPEAKER_04: Well, yeah, a color of wood style, a white and a couple of pretty colors.
SPEAKER_04: And the leverage standard with a pretty color but not too much.
SPEAKER_04: Banana and mango, not purple or orange.
SPEAKER_03: But I think the standard must be some kind of attractive, flashy color.
SPEAKER_03: Not too button, a little.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, like this.
SPEAKER_01: This isn't too much, is it?
SPEAKER_03: Well, the buttons.
SPEAKER_02: It could be a standard model.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, something like this would be nice.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, that's for most.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, it's my time now.
SPEAKER_03: The marketing expert.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: During the design lifecycle, we made a lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff.
SPEAKER_02: Now is the time to evaluate our prototype concept to the past requirements.
SPEAKER_02: So we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis.
SPEAKER_02: We're going to do that with a seven point scale.
SPEAKER_02: Opening a word document now.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: One.
SPEAKER_02: I have to explain something.
SPEAKER_02: We have to be consensus about things.
SPEAKER_02: So it has to be a group decision.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So we're going to evaluate the.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the thing we need.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. One.
SPEAKER_02: The remote controls designed for people with age below 40.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Seven.
SPEAKER_03: Seven is fourth.
SPEAKER_01: True.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: One.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, one.
SPEAKER_01: I think most true.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's not just designed for people under the age of 40.
SPEAKER_01: It's also designed for people above 40.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's not just the question is aimed at design for people with age below 40.
SPEAKER_01: But it's also designed for people above 40.
SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
SPEAKER_01: Also, it's about three.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it will be primarily appealing to minus 40.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Also, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: The second.
SPEAKER_02: The remote controls.
SPEAKER_02: Beautiful.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Wow.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: According to us, it's one.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's the marketing.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: We have a one.
SPEAKER_02: Of course, you have to be very positive and enthusiastic about your own problem.
SPEAKER_02: That's also three.
SPEAKER_02: The remote control looks fancy.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: One.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Perfect.
SPEAKER_02: Good.
SPEAKER_02: For the remote control, it's big, clear, channel switching buttons.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: These two user faces.
SPEAKER_04: User interface experts.
SPEAKER_02: Data text buttons and volume buttons.
SPEAKER_02: No, data text.
SPEAKER_03: But data text is in the menu.
SPEAKER_01: False?
SPEAKER_01: False.
SPEAKER_02: And volume.
SPEAKER_02: Volume is true.
SPEAKER_02: Big and clear.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Big and clear.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Big and clear.
SPEAKER_04: But you could make a teletext button six.
SPEAKER_04: Otherwise people would read this.
SPEAKER_04: I'm going to think we have no teletext button.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's not in your show.
SPEAKER_01: It isn't entirely unclear.
SPEAKER_01: So I wouldn't give it a seven.
SPEAKER_01: I would give it a five or a six.
SPEAKER_01: Five?
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's a project.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I agree.
SPEAKER_03: I was thinking very black and white.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Looking at it.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you, Jenny.
SPEAKER_03: Brad.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I forget to say to volume.
SPEAKER_02: The remote control is easy to be found.
SPEAKER_04: Well, we put fancy colors here.
SPEAKER_01: And it has all these fruity colors and it has a strange shape.
SPEAKER_01: So if you have trouble finding it.
SPEAKER_04: It's not making any sounds.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So, look.
SPEAKER_02: If you put your normal remote control under your bed, or you throw the S remote control under your bed, it's a better finding.
SPEAKER_04: It will make a difference.
SPEAKER_04: We have the better remote.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know.
SPEAKER_04: I think so.
SPEAKER_04: My remote control is black.
SPEAKER_04: A little bit maybe.
SPEAKER_02: A little bit.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We can do it glow in the dark.
SPEAKER_03: So even the dark place you feel.
SPEAKER_02: I think five.
SPEAKER_02: It doesn't really make a lot of.
SPEAKER_01: Well, then I'll go for four.
SPEAKER_01: Four?
SPEAKER_01: Because four is between three and between two.
SPEAKER_04: Okay, you're right.
SPEAKER_03: I think five is between four and six.
SPEAKER_03: According to the other remote controls, there may be there in your TV room.
SPEAKER_03: There's one we'll stand out.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's a better question.
SPEAKER_03: I think that's one more spot.
SPEAKER_03: If this line on your couch, you think, what's that for?
SPEAKER_02: Sure, sure.
SPEAKER_02: The survey under users was that they really lost it.
SPEAKER_04: They're stupid.
SPEAKER_02: Like not seeing it, but lost it in the house or something.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: If you see a strange shape line somewhere, then you'd recognize it as, whoa, that's strange.
SPEAKER_04: That's a remote control.
SPEAKER_02: What is that?
SPEAKER_02: I agree, I agree.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, most of the time, you lose it your shirt.
SPEAKER_04: So your remote controls are fresh through the collar.
SPEAKER_04: I would call it a choose two because we decided not to make two fresh collars.
SPEAKER_02: Not too fresh.
SPEAKER_02: The remote controls are made of soft material.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, rubber is kind of soft.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but not too soft.
SPEAKER_01: Not too soft.
SPEAKER_03: Three?
SPEAKER_03: Three.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, easy to use.
SPEAKER_03: Easy to use?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, can it be zero?
SPEAKER_01: Well, I don't, yeah, it's just kind of easy to use.
SPEAKER_02: It's not the most easy to use.
SPEAKER_04: No, it can do two because...
SPEAKER_04: It can be easier.
SPEAKER_04: It can be easier.
SPEAKER_04: Just with ten buttons.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but then you'll lose our functionality.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, functionality and our fancy look.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but the most easy to use.
SPEAKER_02: It's just with one button.
SPEAKER_04: The other easy to use because you have primary buttons always.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay, but not the most easy to use.
SPEAKER_01: No, actually, I'll go for two.
SPEAKER_01: My vote's on two.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, mine too.
SPEAKER_02: We also have to compare it to the remote controls on the market nowadays.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, wait, it's just a minute.
SPEAKER_04: Inspiration.
SPEAKER_03: What's the time we also have to do the evaluation and the production.
SPEAKER_02: Regular remote stuff.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I'm hurrying.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, eleven.
SPEAKER_02: The remote controls and all of this.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_04: Two, one.
SPEAKER_04: You agree, Tim?
SPEAKER_03: Of course.
SPEAKER_03: You have to see the more innovative thing in there.
SPEAKER_02: The remote controls, remove both of them.
SPEAKER_04: Yes, one.
SPEAKER_04: Very multifunctional.
SPEAKER_04: No.
SPEAKER_02: The remote control.
SPEAKER_02: It has speech recognition.
SPEAKER_04: This is used with speech recognition.
SPEAKER_02: The remote control has building games.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: But maybe make it too because the games are in a sub-menu and not, it's not the one.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but they are built in.
SPEAKER_04: So it's one.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, no, I'll build in.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: The lost.
SPEAKER_01: But, I thought it was going to be a bit less.
SPEAKER_01: You really like the parental advice.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: Did you make this or the safe house?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, he made it.
SPEAKER_04: He changed it, man.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The moss.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, dear.
SPEAKER_03: How is your turn?
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
None: Thank you.
SPEAKER_00: Let's see.
SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: We have now to calculate the production cost.
SPEAKER_03: If it's under 12 and a half euro, then it's a.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: But it is, if it is, but no, this is right.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: Redesign.
SPEAKER_03: If you're under 50.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Sorry.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's a car.
SPEAKER_03: It's under 12 and a half euro.
SPEAKER_03: Then we can move on to the project evaluation as we have experienced it.
SPEAKER_03: Otherwise we have to do a little redesign thingy.
SPEAKER_03: So we have to fill in the numbers of the components.
SPEAKER_03: We have to want to do it in and see if we stay under the 12 and a half euro.
SPEAKER_03: So do we have a hand dynamic?
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: That's zero.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: Battery.
SPEAKER_03: One.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Simple chip on print?
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: Simple sensor.
SPEAKER_03: Simple speaker.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: It's fast chip.
None: It's three.
SPEAKER_02: Three.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: One.
SPEAKER_02: One.
SPEAKER_02: One piece.
SPEAKER_03: Three euro.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_01: What's a sample sensor?
SPEAKER_01: Well, that's speech recognition.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's speech recognition.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: One.
SPEAKER_03: Zero.
SPEAKER_03: Uncurfed flat.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: Zero.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: But it's not made from a single uncurfed thingy and then...
SPEAKER_00: No.
SPEAKER_03: Thingy.
SPEAKER_03: And then...
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So it's only once double curved.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Because the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the...
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: We're now in a problem.
SPEAKER_03: Because we have...
SPEAKER_03: We have 11 euro.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: We don't have anything else.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: We'll see how much we are over budget.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: You step a little to the wrong.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Sorry.
SPEAKER_03: Two.
SPEAKER_03: Rubber.
SPEAKER_03: You don't...
SPEAKER_03: Ditani, I'm no.
SPEAKER_04: Special.
SPEAKER_04: It's the special color.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: It's a standard color.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: This is a special color.
SPEAKER_03: We want to make the wood color.
SPEAKER_03: So that's...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: If you're honest with you all the time, you have a special color.
SPEAKER_02: That's an adult.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That's another brand.
SPEAKER_02: That's another article.
SPEAKER_02: The cell.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But we're going to...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That's true.
SPEAKER_03: But yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It doesn't account for this.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe we'll finish this.
SPEAKER_03: And then look back.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: No.
SPEAKER_04: Scoville.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: One.
SPEAKER_03: One.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: We don't have...
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: We're only four of our budget.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So, what's the thing we can change?
SPEAKER_01: Well, are there a case?
SPEAKER_01: We can make it single-curved or uncurved.
SPEAKER_00: Can I...
SPEAKER_00: I say something?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Of course.
SPEAKER_03: Can I say something?
SPEAKER_03: Asparatic management.
SPEAKER_03: Just...
SPEAKER_03: The kinetic thing.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Can we just skip it?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: You have to shake it, but that's not really enough.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: We just put it in battery and it's mobile phone nowadays.
SPEAKER_02: Daniel.
SPEAKER_02: Daniel.
SPEAKER_02: Daniel.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: What do you think about putting a battery in it?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But also selling like the coffee or a docking station.
SPEAKER_02: Just apart from the thing.
SPEAKER_02: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_02: And then you can put rechargeable batteries in it.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: Just...
SPEAKER_04: What you can use rechargeable batteries anyway.
SPEAKER_04: Just...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Not really enough.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: But we...
SPEAKER_03: You forget about the kinetic.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Sure.
SPEAKER_03: Well, if we do that...
SPEAKER_03: Which are you?
SPEAKER_01: Thirteen to health.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Well, you can go from double-curved to single-curved.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Of course.
SPEAKER_01: And that would solve the budget problem.
SPEAKER_01: So we have to break the...
SPEAKER_03: But the single-curved is just...
SPEAKER_03: It's just...
SPEAKER_03: Oh.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Well, the single-curved...
SPEAKER_04: One-curved and not the back-curved I think.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Exactly.
SPEAKER_03: That's one option.
SPEAKER_03: And then, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Then we could have it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's...
SPEAKER_03: It's a main point of the...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But we'll look.
SPEAKER_04: Then we have to cut out.
SPEAKER_04: We don't fall.
SPEAKER_04: It's a little bit of problem.
SPEAKER_04: No, no, no.
SPEAKER_03: That can be done.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_04: Oh, though, can we make it with the back- Okay.
SPEAKER_03: A little less...
SPEAKER_03: Conversation.
SPEAKER_03: Hey.
SPEAKER_02: Those are...
SPEAKER_02: Art.
SPEAKER_02: Art.
SPEAKER_02: What are they for?
SPEAKER_02: Some...
SPEAKER_02: Blue...
SPEAKER_03: Blue...
SPEAKER_03: Fill in the mirror.
SPEAKER_03: Just...
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Explanation.
SPEAKER_02: So 50?
SPEAKER_03: I can delete it for you if you want.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, no.
SPEAKER_03: So if we do this, we are on 12.
SPEAKER_03: And a half euro.
SPEAKER_03: And we're done?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: But does it fit with our design?
SPEAKER_04: Maybe actually...
SPEAKER_03: Well, the only thing that don't...
SPEAKER_03: The single curve.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, single curve.
SPEAKER_03: But there's a curve in it.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_04: We just make the bubbles cut off the back and then...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, we just make it flat.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: But you do look...
SPEAKER_02: Look, what is the...
SPEAKER_02: If you make it double curve.
SPEAKER_02: It costs one euro more.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You make it optional.
SPEAKER_02: No, but...
SPEAKER_02: Does it have a lot of extra...
SPEAKER_02: Function?
SPEAKER_01: Actually...
SPEAKER_02: Function more.
SPEAKER_02: What does it have added with?
SPEAKER_02: A static value, but not function.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's really a static value.
SPEAKER_02: A static.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, you make like 11 and a half euros a profit.
SPEAKER_02: Instead of 12 and a half, but...
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if 12 and a half is a fixed price.
SPEAKER_02: Now, well, that's a true price.
SPEAKER_01: We should assume that it is.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think the kinetic would be a marketing promotion.
SPEAKER_01: If you promote kinetic...
SPEAKER_01: I...
SPEAKER_01: Kinetic remote control.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, that would sell better than a normal remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Do you think?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Well, now you can shake your remote control.
SPEAKER_01: No, well, I mean, you can count to your neighbor and tell them, Ha!
SPEAKER_01: My remote control is kinetic.
SPEAKER_01: You have standard old battery control remote control.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: What about all the environments freaks?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but it does fit in a cost profile.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's...
SPEAKER_04: It's a good light there, as well.
SPEAKER_04: You can make it in a specialized extra gold version.
SPEAKER_03: Because if you want to go to kinetic, you're on turning a half and you must go to flat.
SPEAKER_03: And I think now it's more of a compromise.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And if you make the single curve, just a big curve, then it's a...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, one big...
SPEAKER_00: One big...
SPEAKER_03: Good curve.
SPEAKER_03: I was coming to a...
SPEAKER_03: Say nasty words, but I don't see.
SPEAKER_03: This is strange, by the way.
SPEAKER_03: Wood is cheaper than rubber.
SPEAKER_03: We thought that wood would be more expensive.
SPEAKER_03: It's American figures.
SPEAKER_04: You just cut down some trees.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, maybe.
SPEAKER_03: But this is it?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, this is it.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, this is it.
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to save it.
SPEAKER_04: I'm going to save it.
SPEAKER_04: Titanium.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It is possible.
SPEAKER_01: But you can't use double curves for titanium.
SPEAKER_01: That's one of the functional biddity.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Well, considering we have...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, no.
SPEAKER_02: I have to do all those hours again.
SPEAKER_02: One back.
SPEAKER_02: Gas on.
SPEAKER_02: No, for redesign.
SPEAKER_03: Well, we were above.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we did a little redesign.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it's that rule.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Now, it's about time to talk about this project.
SPEAKER_03: Some things.
SPEAKER_03: Was there room for creativity?
SPEAKER_03: In our meetings, or in your individual meetings?
SPEAKER_02: I didn't think so.
SPEAKER_02: There was a lot of room for it.
SPEAKER_02: But that's mainly because of the information that was delivered to us.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there.
SPEAKER_02: And I couldn't go on the internet and share my own stuff.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That's true.
SPEAKER_03: I agree with that.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I think you too.
SPEAKER_01: Especially you and the...
SPEAKER_01: I don't know, you both had the less creative roles in the project.
SPEAKER_03: That's true.
SPEAKER_04: For us, I think...
SPEAKER_04: Also, I think we could just sign up and remove it if you like.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's true.
SPEAKER_01: I think you're run and I.
SPEAKER_01: We had more design.
SPEAKER_01: We could have more...
SPEAKER_01: We had more room for creativity than you too.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's true.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: How about leadership?
SPEAKER_03: Leadership was crappy.
SPEAKER_02: The leadership wasn't crappy.
SPEAKER_01: It was the leader that was crappy.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: Leadership was okay.
SPEAKER_01: We're done.
SPEAKER_04: Example of crappy leadership.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I thought the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You could have...
SPEAKER_02: But it was your first?
SPEAKER_02: No disrespect or something.
SPEAKER_02: But you could have structured a little bit more.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So, like, I was talking most of the time, the first meeting.
SPEAKER_02: You could say shut up.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But I know the city too.
SPEAKER_03: I was also very unhappy, very unsatisfied about...
SPEAKER_03: About me.
SPEAKER_03: About the first meeting.
SPEAKER_03: So, I hope...
SPEAKER_03: That's a little fun on the stage.
SPEAKER_01: And we will never do it again.
SPEAKER_03: Get better.
SPEAKER_03: And I think the last two meetings also, we reached some good decision.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: More consensus.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Everybody was really...
SPEAKER_03: Much more constructive.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So, that's cool.
SPEAKER_03: Teamwork?
SPEAKER_03: Well, maybe that's only...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, well, it's for us.
SPEAKER_04: Well, we worked together on the project, but everybody has his own tasks.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And it's more like presentation.
SPEAKER_03: And some points were discussed.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Really teamwork where you two...
SPEAKER_03: So, I just went to crazy.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it went well.
SPEAKER_01: It's just...
SPEAKER_01: It was hard to feel.
SPEAKER_01: Stupid then, but...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we had some trouble with the pen.
SPEAKER_03: Now you must push a little while.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, but it was something difficult.
SPEAKER_04: Just write your name right now.
SPEAKER_04: Try to write your name.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: In writing letters, of course.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, normally...
SPEAKER_04: This is a block letter sign there.
SPEAKER_04: Just write your name in one line.
SPEAKER_04: Just a little bit small, ankylric, quicker now.
SPEAKER_03: You can be...
SPEAKER_03: You can go quicker, because then it won't notice it.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, he knows how to work.
SPEAKER_03: I followed him out to class for the smartboard.
SPEAKER_03: I think that's the main issue.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So, about this one you were...
SPEAKER_03: You were dealing with?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: The digital pen?
SPEAKER_04: The idea is great, but it works properly.
SPEAKER_02: The digital pen, I thought, the first time I did individual work, I used it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And the first two meetings, I brought it with me, but I didn't use it at all after the first meeting.
SPEAKER_02: No, I haven't proven it.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I was not real used.
SPEAKER_01: No, I don't have that much added value to it.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: As I said a few moments ago, I would like myself to write it with a normal pen, because it must...
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it's almost the same concept, but you can just more simply put it on our scanner.
SPEAKER_04: It's the same concept.
SPEAKER_04: It must depend.
SPEAKER_04: You have to download software, very slow.
SPEAKER_03: And it is still your own handwriting, up and up.
SPEAKER_04: It doesn't give any added value.
SPEAKER_03: No, it's really not.
SPEAKER_03: And the smartboard is useful, but the pen is not user-friendly, I think.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, not user-friendly.
SPEAKER_03: It takes a lot of time to draw things and write things.
SPEAKER_02: It's not very precise.
SPEAKER_02: We try to do this.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, and try to write your name in a normal size.
SPEAKER_04: Smaller.
SPEAKER_04: Smaller?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, smaller.
SPEAKER_04: Just when you're writing on a letter.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but that's not...
SPEAKER_03: When you send an added foreign audience, you don't gonna write...
SPEAKER_04: As you saw on this drawing, it's open this one or that one.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, we have more problems even here.
SPEAKER_04: When we try to draw this button, it's almost impossible for clear roundings when you're...
SPEAKER_03: Oh.
SPEAKER_03: But maybe there's some function with...
SPEAKER_03: No, it isn't.
SPEAKER_04: And the eraser was not a problem.
SPEAKER_04: It's this large.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, you try to erase this line.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I'm gonna erase my name.
SPEAKER_04: I'm gonna erase my name.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's a big eraser.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, new ideas.
SPEAKER_04: Erm, what kind of new ideas?
SPEAKER_03: Well, the idea of the touch screen is...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, two years.
SPEAKER_03: Go on.
SPEAKER_03: I'm just...
SPEAKER_04: New ideas about the working of this software, about the project, about remote controls.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know what I mean.
None: I don't know what I mean.
SPEAKER_03: Did you heard what you said?
SPEAKER_03: I don't...
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what I mean.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I have some figure.
SPEAKER_02: Here.
SPEAKER_02: The evaluation.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The mean number is 1.8, 1.86.
SPEAKER_02: That's interesting.
SPEAKER_02: So that's fairly good, I think.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Because what does it mean?
SPEAKER_02: So true.
SPEAKER_02: That...
SPEAKER_02: All the requirements are between 1 and 2.
SPEAKER_03: True or varied.
SPEAKER_03: True.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: Expert.
SPEAKER_03: But the new ideas found with working with this software?
SPEAKER_04: Not really.
SPEAKER_04: They have to improve.
SPEAKER_04: The concept is okay.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think.
SPEAKER_04: But it has to be quicker.
SPEAKER_04: It's still opening my program.
SPEAKER_04: How much of my entire computer is locked up?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: It just takes too many time.
SPEAKER_04: People will still feel the need to write it quickly on a page and not download it and save it.
SPEAKER_03: You're expected to be more user friendly.
SPEAKER_04: When you use a pen, you can just draw like you do normally.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe the idea you proposed is a screen here.
SPEAKER_02: You can draw it and it's placed over there.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Or at least when you don't have to adapt to the technologies, you can write in a way you normally write.
SPEAKER_04: Now you have to keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen and that's a very bad concept.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, that's true.
SPEAKER_02: Very bad.
SPEAKER_04: No, okay.
SPEAKER_02: It's my opinion that this is better than regular flipovers.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, it can be safety easier.
SPEAKER_04: But if you're in normal flipover, a lot of people write text.
SPEAKER_04: There's not a text option.
SPEAKER_04: And writing text, you've got to really do your best.
SPEAKER_03: And maybe some functions for a circle or a square.
SPEAKER_03: You have to draw it yourself now.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe even insert picture if you have some presentation.
SPEAKER_01: Or text function.
SPEAKER_01: Just type text.
SPEAKER_01: That would be excellent.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but insert image isn't available.
SPEAKER_02: Because then you could picture from scanner clip-on.
SPEAKER_02: That can be done already.
SPEAKER_03: But not the hyperlink predefined squares.
SPEAKER_02: What if you do like hyperlink?
SPEAKER_04: It was www.google.com.
SPEAKER_02: Real reaction.
SPEAKER_00: No.
SPEAKER_02: That's okay.
SPEAKER_04: You'll just make a link in.
SPEAKER_04: Well, that's nice.
SPEAKER_04: There's one way to double click it.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe if you're not using the eraser.
SPEAKER_02: Erasing.
SPEAKER_02: Something else.
SPEAKER_02: Select.
SPEAKER_02: Double click.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Well, you have, as you saw, you have a little.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, thank you.
SPEAKER_03: You can go.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
None: There.
SPEAKER_03: So there are the functionality is there.
SPEAKER_03: It's not ideal.
SPEAKER_03: It costs a lot of time to use.
SPEAKER_04: To use.
SPEAKER_03: And that's a pity.
SPEAKER_03: If you have 30, 40 minutes.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: For this kind of thing.
SPEAKER_03: And we are now with four people.
SPEAKER_03: Well, imagine you are here with ten people.
SPEAKER_03: Everyone.
SPEAKER_04: You're here with management.
SPEAKER_04: You get two minutes to make your case.
SPEAKER_04: Two minutes of drawing.
SPEAKER_04: You better use power points and work it out in a font.
SPEAKER_04: And one or two things you have to draw when you're there.
SPEAKER_02: What I really miss also is a.
SPEAKER_02: It's a decision system like.
SPEAKER_02: You have to.
SPEAKER_02: You have to.
SPEAKER_02: Both like what do you want?
SPEAKER_02: One or two?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe a little application like.
SPEAKER_02: Give your number and click one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Just like you said with the screen which you can write.
SPEAKER_03: Also kind of voting.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Voting application.
SPEAKER_02: Just a little group.
SPEAKER_02: Group decision application.
SPEAKER_01: But the problem is you can't discuss anything.
SPEAKER_01: Well, you can.
SPEAKER_01: You can.
SPEAKER_01: But you will discuss a lot less than like we did now.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, one person maybe said free.
SPEAKER_01: But we said no.
SPEAKER_01: I think too because this and this and then you can react on it.
SPEAKER_01: But if you put a free on it.
SPEAKER_01: Just figure out everybody knows what I'm knowing.
SPEAKER_01: So they all just put a two on.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, of course.
SPEAKER_02: But you can still discuss about it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But click it in an application.
SPEAKER_02: That's a lot easier to process.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: For process.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But then I think the idea of one person entering it and discussing it.
SPEAKER_01: Isn't that bad idea actually.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Not that your opinion isn't value, but still.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: So.
SPEAKER_04: That's it.
SPEAKER_03: Well, just about.
SPEAKER_04: Because when are we going to produce it?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Tomorrow.
SPEAKER_03: Celebrate.
SPEAKER_03: Because we're within the budget.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: The project is a fairly good.
SPEAKER_03: But before we don't celebrate.
SPEAKER_03: I have a little question which you can't answer because there must be some kind of entry port.
SPEAKER_03: I'm busy with the entry port right now.
SPEAKER_03: You might think what the hell is he doing?
SPEAKER_02: What is an entry port?
SPEAKER_03: About all the meetings, what we have decided.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: A report of this day.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That must be made.
SPEAKER_03: But I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: Here is standing.
SPEAKER_03: Well, we can celebrate now.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You have ten minutes left.
SPEAKER_02: I read.
SPEAKER_02: You have now ten minutes left to finish up the entry.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Well, that can be done.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe we can do it together.
SPEAKER_03: You can see when I've.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I will put it on a storyboard.
SPEAKER_03: You can see it.
SPEAKER_03: Because I think it will.
SPEAKER_03: It must be.
SPEAKER_02: You're all made better.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's a three.
SPEAKER_03: 75 pages.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: 75 pages.
SPEAKER_03: Well, just a moment.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Daniel.
SPEAKER_02: You want a chair?
SPEAKER_02: Maybe.
SPEAKER_02: A chairman.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, no.
SPEAKER_03: I'm just.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, you can read it.
SPEAKER_03: Here it is.
SPEAKER_03: You finish it actually.
SPEAKER_01: So we just have to read it.
SPEAKER_01: And so yes or no?
SPEAKER_03: Well, it's not.
SPEAKER_03: Read only.
SPEAKER_03: But it's not.
SPEAKER_03: It's not.
SPEAKER_02: Five minutes.
SPEAKER_03: Yep.
SPEAKER_03: For finishing.
SPEAKER_03: This is about the functional design.
SPEAKER_03: The management expert here.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Change that.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: When I said it, I remember.
SPEAKER_02: I said read only version.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but you can save it under another name.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: One thing actually.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: About three functions which are most used and which must immediately be visible on our remote control.
SPEAKER_03: It must be simple to use.
SPEAKER_03: Very clear what to do and the younger people.
SPEAKER_03: So this is really about what kind of things must be in it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe.
SPEAKER_02: Oh.
None: Yeah.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I understand you.
SPEAKER_03: I can talk a little bit.
SPEAKER_02: You have to put switch channels at the top because that's the most function.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Data text at the second.
SPEAKER_03: I really didn't.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: Volume changing.
SPEAKER_03: So this one switch.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: You go there and you go.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Cool.
SPEAKER_03: Well, maybe I can do it.
SPEAKER_03: One, two, three.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: I've got it.
SPEAKER_03: Good.
SPEAKER_03: If the order is in.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Important.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That's the word for the order.
SPEAKER_03: Then the conceptual design.
SPEAKER_03: Well, all the things we have discussed the energy.
SPEAKER_03: Which turn out to be a battery.
SPEAKER_03: So that's working.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe you can add it later.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We decided because of the cost.
SPEAKER_03: It is still double curve.
SPEAKER_03: The flash.
SPEAKER_03: The fruity.
SPEAKER_03: The removable.
SPEAKER_03: It's not double anymore.
SPEAKER_03: Not double anymore.
SPEAKER_03: Now, but this is what.
SPEAKER_03: Was on the shield.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And the added function flag.
SPEAKER_03: The parent control and touchscreen.
SPEAKER_03: Just a summary of what we had discussed.
SPEAKER_03: One small thing.
SPEAKER_01: The added functions.
SPEAKER_01: Was it included in the cost?
SPEAKER_01: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_04: It's very cheap.
SPEAKER_04: It's very cheap.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe you come at the.
SPEAKER_02: No, it's not very cheap but it's very necessary.
SPEAKER_02: No, but it's.
SPEAKER_02: Development inside corporation.
SPEAKER_02: Like we don't have to buy parental control.
SPEAKER_02: Our own people can.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it has some cost.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So we can discuss that.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We can discuss that kind of things I think with.
SPEAKER_03: With the board of.
SPEAKER_03: Of direction.
SPEAKER_03: What's the company call?
SPEAKER_03: I just keep forgetting it.
SPEAKER_03: Real reaction.
SPEAKER_03: Real reaction.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So anybody miss something here about.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, the end conclusion.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: That's what I'm going to write.
SPEAKER_02: Still the end conclusion.
SPEAKER_03: That's all.
SPEAKER_03: I think.
SPEAKER_03: In here nothing.
SPEAKER_04: The decision to make the buttons on the top and the menu on the.
SPEAKER_04: On the bottom.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Clearly touch screen.
SPEAKER_04: You've mentioned.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Touch screen.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The decisions are put in the conclusion.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Why we decided to.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: LCD.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I got a.
SPEAKER_03: Redeciner something now.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Because I think it will five minutes from.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, for you change anything.
SPEAKER_04: Save the list.
SPEAKER_04: You can select file exports and then there's the impact files.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we're done.
SPEAKER_02: You've had the same thing.
SPEAKER_04: Eight.
SPEAKER_04: We have another blank.
SPEAKER_04: Sample of children.
SPEAKER_02: You change anything?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, wait.
SPEAKER_02: Wait.
None: Wow.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: A new way.
SPEAKER_04: Commercial logo.
SPEAKER_04: That's a petite.
SPEAKER_04: Don't save it.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, that's cool, Tim.
SPEAKER_03: Finish meeting now.
None: Why are we only the first five smartboard five?
SPEAKER_03: I'm going to finish Mario and before.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.

None: Yeah.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: How about the N34?
None: And the other one is while you are finished, before the other one is, I know it's a match.
None: Next, the science day.
None: It only takes five minutes.
None: And I do explain to you later, it's just five minutes because we already did.
None: Okay.
None: And you'll still be in time.
None: Okay.
None: You have a lot of cool things.
None: Okay.
None: Who do you lose?
None: Question.
None: What the fuck?
SPEAKER_01: I thought there's quite an irritating sound.
SPEAKER_03: Some questionery.
