SPEAKER_02: I'm sorry, not really.
SPEAKER_02: Thanks for being here.
SPEAKER_01: Your judgment is biased.
SPEAKER_02: I need to do my control and stay for her time.
SPEAKER_01: So, let's go for our detailed design meeting.
SPEAKER_01: So, I will still play the role of the secretary and we'll have first the presentation by our user interface designer, David Jordan, and our industrial designer, Baba.
SPEAKER_01: So, we'll have to evaluate your proposed remote control and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost.
SPEAKER_01: In case if we all agree on the fabric of building a C3 remote control, we'll evaluate the production.
SPEAKER_01: So, maybe I will let our two designers talk about some...
SPEAKER_01: I have slides.
SPEAKER_01: You have slides.
SPEAKER_02: This is our product prototype.
SPEAKER_02: This is made by Klin.
SPEAKER_02: It looks strange.
SPEAKER_02: The basic color is yellow and red. Yellow is our company color. I read it. It's more attractive.
SPEAKER_02: So, we use two basic colors.
SPEAKER_02: At the ship, there's two basic ships. The first is the cycle.
SPEAKER_02: And the second is the triangle space.
SPEAKER_02: We call it mushroom design. It looks like the mushroom design.
SPEAKER_02: This is the introduction of our product.
SPEAKER_01: Genetically modified mushroom, I will say.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the next slide. So, there are several key features of our prototype.
SPEAKER_02: The first is that it is fancy. I'm sure this would be the unique design in the market.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe I hope so.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, so it's a fancy design and a unique design.
SPEAKER_02: The second key feature is that the circle channel selection.
SPEAKER_02: In the traditional controller, you use button to select the channel.
SPEAKER_02: But now we have a suck circle. So, we can turn this ball to select channel.
SPEAKER_02: It's quite convenient for users to use it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but don't touch. Don't destroy your first time.
SPEAKER_02: Okay. The third feature is the stable triangle base.
SPEAKER_02: This triangle base is very stable. So, it's unlikely you cannot find it.
SPEAKER_02: So, you can put it in the table. So, you can turn the ball to select the channel.
SPEAKER_02: And there's some cute button. You can see the shape of the button is a mushroom.
SPEAKER_01: Everything's mushroom. So, we can call our remote control that mushroom.
SPEAKER_02: It was not really mushroom because you have lemon shape.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's why if you put it in the table, careful somebody will eat it.
SPEAKER_02: I hope nobody will eat it anyway. You're trying to get the food aspect.
SPEAKER_03: Mushroom was not in the trance.
SPEAKER_03: For its vegetables.
SPEAKER_03: It's vegetable.
SPEAKER_02: It's vegetable.
SPEAKER_01: It's something eatable.
SPEAKER_02: We integrated the different color.
SPEAKER_03: But this is not a mushroom anyway. So, it's fine.
SPEAKER_02: I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable biasing.
SPEAKER_03: These colors.
SPEAKER_02: And spider color.
SPEAKER_02: And very sophisticated material.
SPEAKER_02: So, next slide.
SPEAKER_02: So, what I can add is that he talks about what is outside.
SPEAKER_02: So, what is inside is what we talked about.
SPEAKER_02: The chip is a low level chip.
SPEAKER_02: So, we cut it.
SPEAKER_02: The low level chips inside.
SPEAKER_02: And the LCD button.
SPEAKER_00: So, where's the battery?
SPEAKER_02: The battery is under the base.
SPEAKER_01: In the base.
SPEAKER_03: And where is the solar set?
SPEAKER_02: This is a kind of new revolutionary receptor that we can put outside.
SPEAKER_01: Do you think it won't be, it won't Christ increase the price?
SPEAKER_02: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, we'll see after.
SPEAKER_01: We'll have the first.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So, Mr. Monet, what's your opinion, according to this remote control?
SPEAKER_03: I mean, we're going to try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about.
SPEAKER_03: We had three key points for this remote control design.
SPEAKER_03: And first one was fancy look and feel.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So, we tried to judge this feature with a one to seven scale.
SPEAKER_03: One being no.
SPEAKER_03: I think.
SPEAKER_03: Just let me check.
SPEAKER_02: So, 4.3.5, it means it's acceptable.
SPEAKER_03: One being true and seven being false.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Oops.
SPEAKER_03: So, do we have a fancy look and feel?
SPEAKER_02: I think you have nice colors.
SPEAKER_02: The shape, the ball shape.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the shape is unique.
SPEAKER_02: The colors.
SPEAKER_03: I agree, it's unique, but is it really?
SPEAKER_02: So, is it really fancy?
SPEAKER_02: Do we define fancy?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I mean, fancy was defined by fruit and vegetable look.
SPEAKER_02: You have the lemon aspect of this.
SPEAKER_02: This is it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe if you change, if you take the buttons out.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe do you think like that?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know where the lemon is, but I mean, it's not obvious.
SPEAKER_02: This shape is the lemon line.
SPEAKER_01: It would be more like a lemon.
SPEAKER_03: If.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe improving the texture, like having less.
SPEAKER_03: Less buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Oh.
SPEAKER_02: So, my mush.
SPEAKER_01: Looks like more fruit.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe a pineapple.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: And you know, you have the finger here with the buttons?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's a good idea.
SPEAKER_01: It looks more like a pineapple.
SPEAKER_01: Sorry.
SPEAKER_01: What's the use for that?
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: If you want to tame the ball, I have no idea.
SPEAKER_02: It's very convenient for you to tame the ball, to change the channel.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: It's embedded.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's the second point.
SPEAKER_03: The second point is we have to judge the.
SPEAKER_01: If it is fancy or not.
SPEAKER_01: Fancy looking feel.
SPEAKER_01: Is it better like that?
SPEAKER_01: Okay, let's say it's a pineapple now.
SPEAKER_02: The color is the color acceptable.
SPEAKER_03: No, the color is okay.
SPEAKER_03: That's fine.
SPEAKER_02: So, the shame.
SPEAKER_03: It's like.
SPEAKER_03: I'd say there is more too much red.
SPEAKER_02: Not too much red.
SPEAKER_01: In the basement.
SPEAKER_01: It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_03: So, from one to seven.
SPEAKER_01: I'll give.
SPEAKER_01: Seven is the maximum?
SPEAKER_03: No, seven is false.
SPEAKER_03: And one is true.
SPEAKER_02: I'll give two or three.
SPEAKER_02: Three, I will say three.
SPEAKER_02: Three is fine for me.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Three.
SPEAKER_01: Is it better like that?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Then, let me.
SPEAKER_03: What are the other criterias?
SPEAKER_03: Is it easier to use technically, technologically innovative?
SPEAKER_01: You said previously that there is some microphone inside.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, this is microphone ring.
SPEAKER_02: It's a microphone.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And you have the microphone ring.
SPEAKER_01: There's the technology inside that recognizes simple vocal comments.
SPEAKER_01: And you can turn it so maybe it's techno.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So, you can.
SPEAKER_02: I have a lot of things around remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but when you say technology, it's more in the core of the single.
SPEAKER_01: We have tactile buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_02: I said you have microphone ring, but you have...
SPEAKER_02: No, that's good.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That's good.
SPEAKER_02: And you have this solar receptor.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That's another really good point.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think that's not going to do it acceptable.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe two.
SPEAKER_01: So using the same scale?
SPEAKER_01: Two?
SPEAKER_01: Two, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Two.
SPEAKER_02: You agree?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Now, maybe the most critical one.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Last one I would like to judge is...
SPEAKER_03: Is it easy to use?
SPEAKER_02: The local common, yes.
SPEAKER_02: It might be easy.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but it's stunning.
SPEAKER_03: Can you just explain me the...
SPEAKER_03: Can you just explain me the...
SPEAKER_02: It's a print saying.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Please.
SPEAKER_02: This is the base.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So you can tend to change the channel.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels?
SPEAKER_03: I think maybe if you...
SPEAKER_02: Like if you want to go from...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I understand.
SPEAKER_01: If you take...
SPEAKER_01: Take from the remote.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: And you can turn like that to change the channel to...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but imagine...
SPEAKER_01: I think it's quite easy to do zapping, but maybe it will be too fast.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I'm not definitely convinced.
SPEAKER_03: It's the best way to...
SPEAKER_03: If you want to jump from, I don't know, 1 to 20.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's different.
SPEAKER_03: How can you go directly to 20, for example?
SPEAKER_02: No, no.
SPEAKER_02: It depends on the angle.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I agree.
SPEAKER_02: I agree.
SPEAKER_02: But I mean...
SPEAKER_02: You need to know...
SPEAKER_02: Is it the channel wide?
SPEAKER_02: So it could be channel...
SPEAKER_02: I think something that's three, channel four, channel five.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you have a click click click click click click click.
SPEAKER_03: Just imagine you have 50 channels.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: 50 channels you buy the number by 330 degree.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So you got how many degree you...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but you have to go through all the channels.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_02: When you stop...
SPEAKER_02: When you stop the...
SPEAKER_02: The tone...
SPEAKER_02: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_02: Then the angle you stop, it's angle you, it's the channel you...
SPEAKER_03: How do you know this angle is the correct one?
SPEAKER_02: It's very easy because you know how many channels are there...
SPEAKER_03: So you count at one degree, two degrees, no?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, you can do it.
SPEAKER_03: I don't think so.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's great.
SPEAKER_02: That's great.
SPEAKER_02: I think so, you can...
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: I think...
SPEAKER_02: But the vocal common is easy to...
SPEAKER_02: You can say 50.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, vocal common is okay.
SPEAKER_02: 50, it's okay.
SPEAKER_03: So we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but when you're zapping, you're changing from one channel to the other, so you're passing through all the channels.
SPEAKER_01: So when you say I want to go to the channel number 20, that's you've decided to go to channel 20, so you can say channel 20.
SPEAKER_01: All right, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Or channel 4, because you really want to go on this channel, but if you really want to...
SPEAKER_01: And this would be more for browsing.
SPEAKER_01: To do zapping, you don't really know what you want to do, you can turn it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting.
SPEAKER_03: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: Seems to be good.
SPEAKER_01: Good choice, Mr. David Jordan.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, you're famous.
SPEAKER_01: And whatever you do.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, what's this?
SPEAKER_01: What's this?
SPEAKER_02: Cherry?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, you can...
SPEAKER_00: Also, the turner.
SPEAKER_02: Turner for the tune.
SPEAKER_02: Turner for the tune.
SPEAKER_02: If you want to skip from channel 1 to channel 2, you skip this.
SPEAKER_02: If you want to skip from channel 1 to channel 10, you turn this.
SPEAKER_02: It's like fine from cost to fine.
SPEAKER_02: This is cost.
SPEAKER_02: This is fine.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's cost to fine.
SPEAKER_02: It's great technology.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, this looks better.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you see, this is from one channel to...
SPEAKER_02: I didn't see where it is.
SPEAKER_02: It's the turner.
SPEAKER_02: Turner for the tuneer.
SPEAKER_02: Turner for the tuneer.
SPEAKER_02: Actually, it's one of the...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you have the vocal comment.
SPEAKER_02: Uh, it's...
SPEAKER_02: On off.
SPEAKER_03: On off, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but it has to be on to...
SPEAKER_01: Most of the time you have them.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's sleeping remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, sleeping.
SPEAKER_03: That's not the ecological...
SPEAKER_03: That's true.
SPEAKER_01: That's why we have the solar...
SPEAKER_02: To come back to the end.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So, which number?
SPEAKER_02: Three.
SPEAKER_02: It is, it's very relative, but three, it's fine, I think.
SPEAKER_02: It's rather than a...
SPEAKER_02: Do you agree?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I agree.
SPEAKER_03: So, the reason about this is four is one.
SPEAKER_02: Three.
SPEAKER_02: Three for me.
SPEAKER_02: It's...
SPEAKER_02: It's okay.
SPEAKER_02: It's...
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_02: Four.
SPEAKER_02: Three.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and just take the...
SPEAKER_01: Or what's your opinion?
SPEAKER_03: Uh, we can even say, I mean...
SPEAKER_03: Those are sort of agree, but this one would be more five to me.
SPEAKER_03: Five?
SPEAKER_03: I would like...
SPEAKER_03: I mean, this is just a prototype.
SPEAKER_03: I'm not really convinced it's so easy to use.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, so...
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: What do you...
SPEAKER_02: What...
SPEAKER_02: You compare with traditional...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: To...
SPEAKER_02: Traditional controller.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's easier than traditional controller.
SPEAKER_02: If you use traditional controller, you have to put the button.
SPEAKER_02: And now you don't have to put the button.
SPEAKER_02: You have...
SPEAKER_02: You just tend the...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but you know...
SPEAKER_02: That's who kind of...
SPEAKER_02: The smaller...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So you can control the scale.
SPEAKER_02: But in the traditional controller, how do...
SPEAKER_02: How can you control the scale?
SPEAKER_02: By pushing zero...
SPEAKER_02: You just put two buttons.
SPEAKER_02: Zero.
SPEAKER_02: That's the first one.
SPEAKER_02: And one.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, you can do it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But you can also do it in the...
SPEAKER_02: But if you do not want to browsing all the channels, you can just...
SPEAKER_02: There's also a button here.
SPEAKER_02: And there's some buttons, okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: This function is just for your broadened.
SPEAKER_02: From one channel to the next one.
SPEAKER_02: The next...
SPEAKER_02: That's not what you say previously.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, if you're changing your mind...
SPEAKER_01: This was the fine...
SPEAKER_01: Fine to course.
SPEAKER_01: Fine.
SPEAKER_01: Of course.
SPEAKER_01: And from 10 to 10 channels.
SPEAKER_02: Why do 10, 10 to 12...
SPEAKER_02: 10 to 20?
SPEAKER_02: And this one, one, two, three, four, five, six.
SPEAKER_02: Like this.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So there's different scale.
SPEAKER_02: So you can...
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: You can choose.
SPEAKER_03: But this...
SPEAKER_03: This has to stay on the table, right?
SPEAKER_03: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_03: This has to stay on the table.
SPEAKER_02: Alright.
SPEAKER_02: You can fuck on a flat.
SPEAKER_02: This is just a bit.
SPEAKER_02: You can just...
None: You can...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But then when you turn it...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Just right?
SPEAKER_01: No, no.
SPEAKER_01: You can't put it out.
SPEAKER_01: That's just your turn in from the base.
SPEAKER_01: You need to have everything in hand.
SPEAKER_01: If you want to turn, you can't use it and turn.
SPEAKER_01: You need to put it on and turn.
SPEAKER_03: You know, that's the weak point because with the traditional one, you just have one hand.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen.
SPEAKER_01: Say, I've lost the remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Nobody would take it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, you would never lose it on the...
SPEAKER_02: So this is the next generation.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe.
SPEAKER_02: It's the next prototype.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe we can change from...
SPEAKER_01: Maybe for it's okay.
SPEAKER_01: For...
SPEAKER_01: Easy to use for.
SPEAKER_01: You can save it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, for it's more.
SPEAKER_03: It's even easier to...
SPEAKER_03: Maybe.
SPEAKER_02: You can...
SPEAKER_02: You can error this.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
None: Yeah.
None: Yeah.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, for it's more than I would say.
SPEAKER_02: So average...
SPEAKER_02: Nine over three?
SPEAKER_02: Three?
SPEAKER_02: Three.
SPEAKER_02: Three.
SPEAKER_02: It's average, it's more than I.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_02: It need maybe some further work, but...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, especially on the easy to use.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Absolutely.
SPEAKER_03: Target.
SPEAKER_01: So the project is accepted.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think...
SPEAKER_01: I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: If you really want to have a fruitful, remote country.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: Is that fine?
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: We had a prototype presentation with the evaluation.
SPEAKER_01: So as we all agree to accept...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Under certain conditions, the prototype will have looked to the financial view.
SPEAKER_01: So we need to calculate the projection cost.
SPEAKER_01: As I said in the first meeting, when to have remote control, that would cost more than 12 and more than 50 euros.
SPEAKER_01: And if not, if it's not the case, you would have to redesign it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So just have a look at the...
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Here is the...
SPEAKER_01: Excel...
SPEAKER_01: Shit.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: So as the energy source, we have Hundinamo.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: We don't use that.
SPEAKER_01: We have battery, right?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Not battery.
SPEAKER_01: Kinetic.
SPEAKER_01: We don't have it, I suppose.
SPEAKER_01: But we have solar cells.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: How many do you need solar cells?
SPEAKER_01: Do you think one would be enough for them?
SPEAKER_01: Such as...
SPEAKER_02: I think it's about...
SPEAKER_01: You have three.
SPEAKER_02: Three.
SPEAKER_02: Three.
SPEAKER_02: Three batteries, three solar cells.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: Electronic.
SPEAKER_01: Single, simple chip on print.
SPEAKER_01: Just one would be necessary.
SPEAKER_01: Simple, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: One.
SPEAKER_01: Zero for the others.
SPEAKER_01: And sample sensors and pull speaker.
None: One.
SPEAKER_01: One.
SPEAKER_03: One.
SPEAKER_01: As we have voice recognition, I think.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So the case...
SPEAKER_02: It would be...
SPEAKER_03: So we are all already 19.
SPEAKER_02: Wooden.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Just...
SPEAKER_01: Keep on going.
SPEAKER_01: Just have an idea.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, yes.
SPEAKER_02: Wooden...
SPEAKER_02: There's no good plastic just on anything.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but what about case?
SPEAKER_01: Uncurved, flat, single curved, double curved.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's more like double curved.
SPEAKER_01: That's a little bit of a double curved.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, double curved.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, double curved.
SPEAKER_01: One.
SPEAKER_02: One, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: One, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Uh, wood?
SPEAKER_02: But it's...
SPEAKER_02: A rubber...
SPEAKER_01: Do you want it's special color?
SPEAKER_01: You may be too.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Two special colors.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Push button.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we have four.
None: Five.
SPEAKER_02: Five.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Scroll wheel?
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: It's more like integrated.
SPEAKER_01: I think this will be like a scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you turn it.
SPEAKER_02: Sorry.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe two scroll wheel eyes.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, true.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: We have the course to find a scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So, no button supplements?
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I think we have problem.
SPEAKER_02: As you display maybe.
SPEAKER_02: Interphase.
SPEAKER_01: I think with...
SPEAKER_01: If we keep on adding things.
SPEAKER_01: It's okay.
SPEAKER_01: That's fine.
SPEAKER_01: So, we have to...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: One of the key points is solar cells.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe if...
SPEAKER_01: If suppose if we change and we put just one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Has it changed?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it was actually...
SPEAKER_03: It did change, but...
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: We have to switch to electronics.
SPEAKER_02: From the samples of the cell to regular tip.
SPEAKER_02: Oh.
SPEAKER_02: We have to delete the samples.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but we have the voice recognition.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but this one, one of the features we were not able to...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's the one...
SPEAKER_02: Maybe we have tumor and the first part in the basic version.
SPEAKER_02: I think you can transform the wood into plastic maybe.
SPEAKER_01: It seems that this can be...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, it would be better.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, wood into plastic.
SPEAKER_02: It should be fine.
SPEAKER_02: Plastic is free.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So, do we need special color?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's one of...
SPEAKER_03: Because we have red.
SPEAKER_01: Red and yellow.
SPEAKER_01: Red and yellow.
SPEAKER_03: We can turn everything in either yellow or black.
SPEAKER_03: Black then is a regular color.
SPEAKER_03: I think so.
SPEAKER_01: If we try to have a kind of...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Pineapple B.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So, push button then it's the next...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And we have integrated scroll wheel with push button.
SPEAKER_01: But now I think this is one.
SPEAKER_01: Integrated scroll wheel push button.
SPEAKER_01: So, we have only one.
SPEAKER_01: And...
SPEAKER_01: Push button.
SPEAKER_01: Close to.
SPEAKER_01: So, if we have all integrated in the scroll wheel and push button.
SPEAKER_01: It's...
SPEAKER_02: Okay, remove maybe...
SPEAKER_02: You have five push buttons so we can just...
SPEAKER_02: Try to modify some of them.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, so what's the...
SPEAKER_03: Like...
SPEAKER_02: How about we change our color?
SPEAKER_02: Double curve.
SPEAKER_02: We can transform the double curve into single...
SPEAKER_01: Something flat.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but flat.
SPEAKER_01: Uncurved.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, maybe not.
SPEAKER_01: Single curve better.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Single curve should be fine.
SPEAKER_00: Ooh, quick.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, we have only one.
SPEAKER_03: Really?
SPEAKER_03: One you were left.
SPEAKER_00: Um...
SPEAKER_01: Maybe don't...
SPEAKER_01: No battery on me, so myself.
SPEAKER_03: I think somebody gets...
SPEAKER_01: I think there's a problem with the push button.
SPEAKER_01: We only need...
SPEAKER_00: Just one.
SPEAKER_00: One push.
SPEAKER_00: Just one.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: That's fine.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So, actually...
SPEAKER_03: So, we have one button.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we have...
SPEAKER_01: So, one button and...
SPEAKER_02: One scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_02: Scroll wheel with push button on it.
SPEAKER_02: And the vocal cover, it's fine.
SPEAKER_02: It's fine.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_03: It's good they're not charging anything for them.
SPEAKER_03: So, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think we've done a good job as the cost is...
SPEAKER_01: Could we have looked at...
SPEAKER_02: Could we have looked at...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Actually, it's wrong.
SPEAKER_03: We're not under...
SPEAKER_03: The cost?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but it's under our equal.
SPEAKER_01: It's not rated.
SPEAKER_01: Sometimes it's under our equal.
SPEAKER_01: It's under our equal.
SPEAKER_02: It's fine.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So, let's see...
SPEAKER_02: Twelve.
SPEAKER_01: Twelve.
SPEAKER_02: Fifty.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's fine, right?
SPEAKER_02: Which part is the most defensive part?
SPEAKER_02: Solar cells.
SPEAKER_02: Solar cells, right?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Is it?
SPEAKER_02: Is it?
SPEAKER_01: I think...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But it would be interesting for our marketing team to make lots of advertisements...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, to be able to sell to the same.
SPEAKER_01:...and concerning these solar cells to be...
SPEAKER_03: That's a nice argument.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's still for our...
SPEAKER_02: It's really, really, really, really, very expensive.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but it would be technologically innovative.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but we just have one button.
SPEAKER_01: So, it's easy to use in Powerful, as the remote controller has only one button?
SPEAKER_03: Easy, you know, about Powerful.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Easy Power.
SPEAKER_02: Easy to use.
SPEAKER_01: So, I don't think we need to redesign the product.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Or that's what we've just done.
None: We've done it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's under the...
SPEAKER_03: If it was low, high and so...
None: So...
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Now...
SPEAKER_02: So, what are we going to do with this project evaluation?
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_03: I think we have to just have to discuss it.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So, did you enjoy your clay modeling?
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Of course.
SPEAKER_01: This is my job.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Was it a nice way to create your remote control?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's a...
SPEAKER_02: It's good to create a control instead of a computer.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think I found it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process from the beginning to the end and designing, looking at the chips, solar cells, and...
SPEAKER_02: It is very informative for me.
SPEAKER_01: And for the marketing guy?
SPEAKER_03: That was good, but we should have more brainstorming like meetings maybe.
SPEAKER_03: Because we're just presenting, one is presenting his stuff, next one his stuff, and then we try to combine afterwards.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And new ideas about new products maybe, which would be fashion and yellow.
SPEAKER_01: Yellow.
SPEAKER_02: I think you can think about yellow TV now after a food TV or I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: It can be interesting.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, just lemon.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, just lemon TV.
SPEAKER_02: You know the traditional TV is flat.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's flat.
SPEAKER_02: It's square.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the chip is very boring.
SPEAKER_02: It's really boring.
SPEAKER_00: It's really boring.
SPEAKER_02: Come up with new TV.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: With such as this kind of TV.
SPEAKER_02: So you can...
SPEAKER_02: You can have this, triangle base, so you have the TV.
SPEAKER_01: The lemon TV with the pineapple remot control.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That is really interesting.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Because the TV...
SPEAKER_01: Oh, that's interesting.
SPEAKER_01: We could do a kind of fruit collection of...
SPEAKER_01: Oh, you like this.
SPEAKER_01:...electronic device.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: You just don't trust too much the trends.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe.
SPEAKER_03: Because fruit and vegetables last for 10 years.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, maybe the message will be insects.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But I think it's good to follow the flow and make it now and after, you know, if the people have changed their mind, you changed their mind.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but this is good because it's not a long life product.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: TV is more like 15 years maybe so.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, that's a lemon TV for...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We can think about TV with, you know, where you can change, you know, the aspect.
SPEAKER_02: So, like for the cell phones.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You customize it every time.
SPEAKER_02: So every time you go to a channel, you just change the appearance.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, so, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You can do it all the time.
SPEAKER_02: You can make it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And keep the number up here.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and following...
SPEAKER_02: The mood of person, the fashion.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's interesting.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe we can create a line of TV.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: TV.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But TV for autumn and a TV for winter, you know.
SPEAKER_02: So, that's...
SPEAKER_02: So, what is it?
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So, I think the costs are within the project.
SPEAKER_01: We're just...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's actually...
SPEAKER_01: 12.50 euros.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: Do you think you can celebrate your own?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You can celebrate your creation.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you can celebrate your leadership.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, thanks a lot.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I say yes.
SPEAKER_01: David Jordan.
SPEAKER_02: It's really a celebrating object.
SPEAKER_02: So, it's, you know, very...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's very happy.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's a party.
SPEAKER_03: It's a very much control.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The thing now is to...
SPEAKER_01: to sell it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's your job.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You sell it.
SPEAKER_02: You sell it.
SPEAKER_00: Good luck.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, and the...
SPEAKER_02: 12.50...
SPEAKER_02: 12.25 euros.
SPEAKER_02: 25 euros.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think it's...
SPEAKER_02: 25 euros.
SPEAKER_02: 25 euros.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think it's...
SPEAKER_02: 25 euros.
SPEAKER_02: So, maybe a little bit expensive.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe a little bit expensive.
SPEAKER_00: No, I'm...
SPEAKER_00: It's not so easy.
SPEAKER_03: I'm not so happy about the fruit chip, you know.
SPEAKER_02: What, really?
SPEAKER_02: It should be fine, you know, actually.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe you eat it.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe you eat it.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe you eat it.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe you can do a test, put it outside and you become...
SPEAKER_01: I mean, you become...
SPEAKER_01: I eat...
SPEAKER_00: really fruit.
SPEAKER_00: I think...
SPEAKER_00: But don't put sugar in it.
SPEAKER_00: The color I'm making is...
SPEAKER_02: The color I'm making.
SPEAKER_02: So, actually...
SPEAKER_02: No, the colors are...
SPEAKER_03: It's perfect, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It's perfect.
SPEAKER_03: And two.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, another thing is the logo is missing still.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but the color, I think the color is more...
SPEAKER_01: The yellow, more...
SPEAKER_01: The yellow, more...
SPEAKER_01: I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Still, that was one of the requirements we had.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but I don't think it's such a problem.
SPEAKER_03: Just putting the logo somewhere.
SPEAKER_02: We can put some...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we decided to have something yellow and red for the costs.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So, maybe we can just integrate it on one side.
SPEAKER_01: The double R.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That's a really good idea, so...
SPEAKER_01: So, we have logo, we have the color, and we have the fashion in electronics.
SPEAKER_01: So, we have the slogan too?
SPEAKER_02: So, we have give him...
SPEAKER_02: Give him...
SPEAKER_02: Give him...
SPEAKER_02: A cute name.
SPEAKER_01: A cute man.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, mushroom control.
SPEAKER_01: No, it's the pineapple control.
SPEAKER_01: You cannot say mushroom because it's not the same.
SPEAKER_01: It's the pineapple now.
SPEAKER_01: It's changed.
SPEAKER_02: It's pineapple.
SPEAKER_02: Pine apple.
SPEAKER_02: Pine apple.
SPEAKER_02: Pine apple.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, just flying saucer.
SPEAKER_02: Let's carry him top.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, that's a flying saucer.
SPEAKER_02: And he didn't fire him once in one.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: That's pineapple remote control.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's fine.
SPEAKER_02: Would you buy one?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'd try to.
SPEAKER_01: I tried to.
SPEAKER_01: 25.
SPEAKER_02: That's beautiful.
SPEAKER_02: I can't...
SPEAKER_02: I would try to work and see how easy it is.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you taught me you lost your control.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I already saw that.
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_02: To need buy buy.
SPEAKER_02: So, if it is a universal, I can use it to my TV.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: One thing I like is the shape because, you know, it's not like the...
SPEAKER_01: The remote controls you can put in your pockets, in your jacket.
SPEAKER_02: This is why, this is why.
SPEAKER_02: What do you choose?
SPEAKER_02: I prefer the laser remote control.
SPEAKER_02: What do you choose?
SPEAKER_02: I think I will choose this one because of the color.
SPEAKER_02: It's okay.
SPEAKER_02: It's you light your house and your home and your TV.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, maybe next if we decide to do something, we can put light inside.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That would be a nice one.
SPEAKER_03: That's gonna be expensive, you know.
SPEAKER_03: We have some problems.
SPEAKER_03: I think...
SPEAKER_01: Going to have euros and...
SPEAKER_01: It would be interesting to just to see if we can...
SPEAKER_01: If people will buy this one and maybe add some features to it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: If it's a new trend.
None: Okay.
