None: o This is our last meeting.
SPEAKER_02: I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting.
SPEAKER_02: And then we'll have the prototype presentation.
SPEAKER_02: Then we will do an evaluation.
SPEAKER_02: We'll see what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation.
SPEAKER_02: Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget.
SPEAKER_02: Then we'll do the evaluation and then we can finish up after that with changes that we'll need to make.
SPEAKER_02: Or hopefully everything will fall right in line.
SPEAKER_02: See minutes from the last meeting.
SPEAKER_02: We looked at the trends.
SPEAKER_02: We had the fashion trends that people want to fancy look and feel.
SPEAKER_02: It was twice as important as anything else.
SPEAKER_02: They liked fruit and vegetables and the new styles.
SPEAKER_02: And a spongy feel.
SPEAKER_02: So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype.
SPEAKER_02: They wanted limited buttons and simplicity.
SPEAKER_02: Then we looked at the method for coming up with our own remote.
SPEAKER_02: Looking at other devices.
SPEAKER_02: The iPod.
SPEAKER_02: We really like to look at that.
SPEAKER_02: We also had the kids remote for a simple idea.
SPEAKER_02: A two part remote, which was what we were originally looking at.
SPEAKER_02: And then there was talk of speech recognition becoming more predominant and easier to use.
SPEAKER_02: But I think we still decided not to go with that.
SPEAKER_02: Then we looked at the components.
SPEAKER_02: The materials for the case, the different energy sources, the different types of chips.
SPEAKER_02: And made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote.
SPEAKER_02: And basically.
SPEAKER_02: How what we were making for the prototype.
SPEAKER_02: So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys.
SPEAKER_02: Take over.
SPEAKER_02: The prototype.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, do you need this?
SPEAKER_04: No.
SPEAKER_04: There he is.
SPEAKER_04: I'll have a blog about it.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, basically we went with the color yellow.
SPEAKER_04: Working on the principle of a fruit, which was mentioned, basically designed around a banana.
SPEAKER_04: But it would be held in such a fashion.
SPEAKER_04: Whereas obviously it wouldn't be that floppy because this would be hard plastic.
SPEAKER_04: These would be like the rubber, the rubber grips.
SPEAKER_04: So that's how helpful the hell we grip.
SPEAKER_04: The ergonomics would be done with this scroll wheel.
SPEAKER_04: And this here represents the screen where you'd go through.
SPEAKER_04: And the simplest function would be almost identical to an iPod.
SPEAKER_04: And that one way through channels, that way with other way through channels.
SPEAKER_04: Volume up and down.
SPEAKER_04: And then to access the more complicated functions.
SPEAKER_04: So you press that and go through the menus.
SPEAKER_04: It's that simple.
SPEAKER_04: That's just represents the infrared beam.
SPEAKER_04: That's a simple or an off switch.
SPEAKER_04: I don't know we could use the voice.
SPEAKER_04: That blue bit should be yellow.
SPEAKER_04: That would be where the batteries would be.
SPEAKER_04: And that's about it.
SPEAKER_04: It's a simple.
SPEAKER_04: We can make it.
SPEAKER_04: Is anything else?
SPEAKER_03: That's what we have.
SPEAKER_03: That's plastic.
SPEAKER_03: Plastic covered with rubber.
SPEAKER_03: We might add some more underneath here.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe give it a form.
SPEAKER_03: I mean we're supposed to hold it like that.
SPEAKER_03: But she grabbed it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, it's just made.
SPEAKER_03: It's definitely just rough.
SPEAKER_03: Left hand in order.
SPEAKER_03: And they just both.
SPEAKER_03: Exactly.
SPEAKER_03: These both might as well.
SPEAKER_03: The actual thing might be smaller.
SPEAKER_03: Think about the bottom.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Either put either one on either side.
SPEAKER_03: Not too at all.
SPEAKER_03: Just a quick on-off button.
SPEAKER_03: That's pretty important.
SPEAKER_03: So you don't have to fit over that.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: That's not.
SPEAKER_03: I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Play with that over there.
SPEAKER_04: Nice flimsy because it's made out of heavy.
SPEAKER_04: Right.
SPEAKER_04: Do you like to?
SPEAKER_01: Well done.
SPEAKER_02: Kind of a banana.
SPEAKER_04: No, whether or not it would fall into the costume and everything I suppose.
SPEAKER_04: Would they scroll and they all see the.
SPEAKER_02: Well, luckily we are going to find out.
SPEAKER_02: Or not luckily.
SPEAKER_02: Do you have a marketing.
SPEAKER_01: I do presentation for us.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria.
SPEAKER_01: That I found just based on the past.
SPEAKER_01: Turn the reports that I was looking at earlier.
SPEAKER_01: And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype.
SPEAKER_01: And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did.
SPEAKER_01: So the criteria we're going to be looking at.
SPEAKER_01: Are the complaints.
SPEAKER_01: That we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier.
SPEAKER_01: So.
SPEAKER_01: We're going to be doing it based on a seven point scale.
SPEAKER_01: And one is going to mean true that we did actually achieve that.
SPEAKER_01: With seven being false we did not achieve that.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So for the first one we need to decide did we solve the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's definitely different than anything else out there.
SPEAKER_02: So if they think that what is out there is ugly then yes.
SPEAKER_02: I would say most definitely it's bright.
SPEAKER_02: But still has your traditional black.
None: It's curved.
SPEAKER_02: There's no sharp angles to it.
SPEAKER_03: Not angular.
SPEAKER_03: It comes to the ergonomics, the form and stuff.
SPEAKER_03: Yes, that's definitely more beautiful than your average.
SPEAKER_03: However the color.
SPEAKER_03: We don't have to say in that.
SPEAKER_03: We have to say that we have to say that we have to solve the problem completely.
SPEAKER_03: Because the color is ugly.
SPEAKER_03: There's nothing you can say about that.
SPEAKER_03: I much prefer something like brushed chrome.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That form.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Something more modern to go.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: A modern color to go with the modern form.
SPEAKER_02: But it's different.
SPEAKER_03: You don't want your three feet huge LCD display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So do you think since we this wasn't assigned criteria?
SPEAKER_01: Do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle of them?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: What do you think?
SPEAKER_02: Three, four.
SPEAKER_02: Four.
SPEAKER_02: Four.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Very non-committal four.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: The second one.
SPEAKER_01: Did we make it simple for new users?
SPEAKER_03: It's very intuitive.
SPEAKER_03: I think.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: That was the main name.
SPEAKER_04: The main names that we had.
SPEAKER_03: One.
SPEAKER_03: One?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Do the controls now match the operating behavior of the users?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: We brought it down to basically four controls where they did the most common channel and volume.
SPEAKER_04: And then the other one was just a matter of just going further.
SPEAKER_02: Just scrolling through and selecting.
SPEAKER_00: So one?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think that's a one.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: The fourth one.
SPEAKER_01: How about the problem of a remote being easily lost?
SPEAKER_01: One of the number one.
SPEAKER_03: Something that big and that yellow you just don't know.
SPEAKER_03: What do you want to know?
SPEAKER_04: I'm going to lose.
SPEAKER_04: But if we were to, if we were that speech recognition that we could maybe just use that solely for the finding thing.
SPEAKER_04: That was what we mentioned.
SPEAKER_02: So if we incorporate speech recognition into it, then just to use to find it.
SPEAKER_04: If it was lost, but like I said, you lose something so yellow so easily.
SPEAKER_04: And it's not going to fall like a rectangle.
SPEAKER_04: Slick down behind things.
SPEAKER_04: That's going to be a difficult shape.
SPEAKER_02: Well, it is quite bright.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Maybe in the middle again, three or four or something.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, you know, losing things is one of those things that people can lose.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: I mean, a million ways you can pick it up and walk away with it and then you lost it.
SPEAKER_02: But if we do go with the with the speech recognition, then it, then our scale goes up quite a bit.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Probably probably two.
SPEAKER_02: You know, if we eliminate the fact that, you know, it's impossible to guarantee that it's not going to be lost.
SPEAKER_02: Let's say two.
SPEAKER_02: With speech recognition, which of course may be changed depending on budget.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So we could add an extra feature actually, which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from television.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We could add that, but that's nothing we have thought of.
SPEAKER_02: Which, which may be cheaper than speech recognition.
SPEAKER_02: It would just stay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, true.
SPEAKER_04: But I mean, just those whistling clappens, cravings, you have that shape.
SPEAKER_04: So I can't be that.
SPEAKER_04: And the space on this anti anti-thas Sort of proximity.
SPEAKER_03: Or suitcases and stuff where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage, another piece that starts beeping that can't cost much.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to hide.
SPEAKER_03: So you have one piece, you have to glue somewhere behind your TV.
SPEAKER_02: Stick it behind your TV and the other.
SPEAKER_02: I'm afraid that you don't accidentally lose that piece.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: That'd be tough.
SPEAKER_03: Well, also your remote would alarm you if somebody stole your TV to your television.
SPEAKER_03: Ran off of that without taking the beautiful remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So, are we adding one of these two features?
SPEAKER_01: Let's add one of those features and say yes.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So we're back to a one.
SPEAKER_01: Or two.
SPEAKER_01: Two.
None: Two.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Are we technologically innovative?
SPEAKER_04: I'd say so.
SPEAKER_04: I don't get my name up.
SPEAKER_04: It's all just souls with screen.
SPEAKER_04: It's all just stolen.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But there's not a lot of yellow.
SPEAKER_02: There's not a lot of yellow.
SPEAKER_02: Of course I wasn't really forced to take that color.
SPEAKER_01: Two.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know the way you are that innovative.
SPEAKER_02: It's too true.
SPEAKER_01: But how many robots do you see like this?
SPEAKER_02: If we added the screaming factor.
SPEAKER_02: Then we go up.
SPEAKER_02: I would say we're probably up four.
SPEAKER_01: Really?
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: It's going to hurt us.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Spongy material.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we do have that.
SPEAKER_03: We have some splashes.
SPEAKER_03: It's native.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: It's not a one though.
SPEAKER_03: One would be the whole thing.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, because it's only got to fold and stuff.
SPEAKER_02: Like these parts of the grips and perhaps the back side, the bottom underneath on the back.
SPEAKER_03: So lots of four.
SPEAKER_02: Probably four at most.
SPEAKER_01: Lastly, did we put the fashion in electronics?
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Your fashion is but is Carmen Miranda?
SPEAKER_02: You betcha.
SPEAKER_03: Well, the recent fashion is rather displayed in the LCD.
SPEAKER_03: It's true.
SPEAKER_03: And you operated the form on the color, but it definitely is.
SPEAKER_04: What we were told.
SPEAKER_04: Definitely.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Now I just got to calculate.
SPEAKER_01: 17.
SPEAKER_01: 17.
SPEAKER_01: 17.
SPEAKER_01: 17.
SPEAKER_04: 17.
SPEAKER_01: Jesus and Amas, You bet whistlebl Right? How does that work?
SPEAKER_03: I'm impressed I can't do that without a calculator.
SPEAKER_03: No, I'm fine.
SPEAKER_01: It's been a while.
SPEAKER_02: And what is the acceptable criteria?
SPEAKER_02: Is there like a scale that we have to hit?
SPEAKER_01: Oh no, I just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it.
SPEAKER_01: Basically.
SPEAKER_02: All right then.
SPEAKER_01: So that's that.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, well, let's see.
SPEAKER_02: Now we get to do the budget numbers.
SPEAKER_02: You didn't know that you were going to have a budget.
SPEAKER_02: But we do.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: It's been going a long time.
SPEAKER_04: It's 2.4 to 8.
SPEAKER_04: I said it was too strong.
SPEAKER_04: Oh my gosh.
SPEAKER_04: 2.4 to 8.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, we're going to have that.
SPEAKER_02: So I have here 50% be pretty.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We want a 50% profit on this.
SPEAKER_02: I can't really see that very well.
SPEAKER_02: Just about finished quickly.
SPEAKER_02: 12 and a half euros is what's supposed to cost us.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so.
SPEAKER_02: It's too much.
SPEAKER_02: Well, let's see.
SPEAKER_02: The.
SPEAKER_02: This.
None: Okay.
None: All right.
SPEAKER_02: All right, so.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know if you guys can read that enough.
SPEAKER_02: I can't sit on my glasses on.
SPEAKER_02: But so we've got the energy source.
SPEAKER_02: There's a four, five, six categories.
SPEAKER_02: We have energy source electronics case.
SPEAKER_02: Then we have case material supplements interface type.
SPEAKER_02: And then button supplements.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so.
SPEAKER_02: First of all, energy source.
SPEAKER_02: We pick battery.
SPEAKER_02: And how many batteries do we think this will probably take?
SPEAKER_02: Probably.
SPEAKER_02: So either two or four.
SPEAKER_02: Two.
None: Two.
None: Like it.
SPEAKER_03: Four is going to be too heavy.
SPEAKER_03: So that's not our problem.
SPEAKER_03: People can change it every month.
None: They won't.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I thought I thought I bought it.
SPEAKER_02: This is consumerism.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: So for the electronics, our choices are simple chip on print, regular chip on print, advanced chip on print, sample sensor, sample speaker.
SPEAKER_03: Advanced chip, that's the advanced chip on print.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: We have one of those.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Then the case is a.
SPEAKER_02: Probably that's double curved.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Case materials are.
SPEAKER_02: Plastic.
SPEAKER_02: Plastic.
SPEAKER_02: I guess it's two since one for the top one for the bottom.
SPEAKER_02: Is that right or is it just one?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, maybe it's one because of the.
SPEAKER_03: It's just one single mode.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I guess it doesn't matter because the price on that one is zero.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: Special color.
SPEAKER_03: That's not a special color.
SPEAKER_02: Especially ugly color.
SPEAKER_02: Interface type.
SPEAKER_02: We have push button scroll wheel interface.
SPEAKER_02: Integrated scroll wheel push button LCD display.
SPEAKER_02: So we actually have the LCD display.
SPEAKER_02: And then is it the integrated or.
SPEAKER_04: Absolutely.
SPEAKER_04: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Button supplement special color.
SPEAKER_02: Special form.
SPEAKER_02: Special material.
SPEAKER_03: We could of course make the buttons would.
SPEAKER_03: Same how can they.
SPEAKER_01: Really love or titanium.
SPEAKER_01: The cost is all.
SPEAKER_02: But we only have one button.
SPEAKER_02: So really we shouldn't be charged.
SPEAKER_02: We shouldn't be charged anything.
SPEAKER_02: The button supplements.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: We're going to leave that one blank because we run on a LCD.
SPEAKER_02: Scroll.
SPEAKER_02: So our total is 15.5.
SPEAKER_02: Which I believe.
SPEAKER_02: Is.
SPEAKER_02: Three euros over.
SPEAKER_03: So we go for the hand.
SPEAKER_02: So the only thing better than a banana shape remote is one of the.
SPEAKER_02: One that you shake.
SPEAKER_04: What if we completely took out the one single button we've got on.
SPEAKER_04: And just had a scroll wheel interface.
SPEAKER_04: And the LCD's way.
SPEAKER_04: I suppose the LCD's way is the one that's putting it off a bit.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Well, because we have to have both, right?
SPEAKER_03: That's a basic.
SPEAKER_03: It also depends on the software on the television you can have.
SPEAKER_04: The information that's been translated on the screen.
SPEAKER_02: You could maybe take out the LCD's.
SPEAKER_03: If it comes up on the computer itself, on the TV itself.
SPEAKER_03: And you're not needed.
SPEAKER_03: There you go.
SPEAKER_02: There we go.
SPEAKER_02: There we go.
SPEAKER_02: Twelve point five.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So we just remove our screen here.
SPEAKER_04: Big a dial.
SPEAKER_04: Easy to use.
SPEAKER_04: Easy to use on.
SPEAKER_02: Besides, look at what the LCD does to our lovely remote.
SPEAKER_02: Back to the design room, boys.
SPEAKER_03: Take away a heck of water.
SPEAKER_01: What's the blue part?
SPEAKER_04: That was just, we ran out of yellow.
SPEAKER_03: There you go.
SPEAKER_04: There you go.
SPEAKER_01: It was simpler.
SPEAKER_04: Looks more like a banana.
SPEAKER_04: Feels a few little bit out there.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Cost under twelve point five zero.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: We redesigned it.
SPEAKER_02: Now it's yes.
SPEAKER_02: Next slide.
SPEAKER_02: Project evaluation.
SPEAKER_02: Project process satisfaction with, for example.
SPEAKER_02: Creativity leadership team work means new ideas found.
SPEAKER_02: So I guess that.
SPEAKER_02: I think that perhaps the project evaluation is just supposed to be complete by me.
SPEAKER_02: But I'd like to hear your thoughts.
SPEAKER_01: What did you think of our project process?
SPEAKER_02: We don't quite well.
SPEAKER_04: Team work.
SPEAKER_03: Right from the start of the day.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We started off a little week.
SPEAKER_02: Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning.
SPEAKER_02: But as the day went along, we had more idea of what we were doing.
SPEAKER_02: Room for creativity.
SPEAKER_02: I think it was interesting as you guys brought up more information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things.
SPEAKER_02: You guys work together.
SPEAKER_02: Well team.
SPEAKER_02: And the means.
SPEAKER_02: Which was the white board depends.
SPEAKER_02: I had some problem with the pen.
SPEAKER_01: I think.
SPEAKER_01: Minus your power point.
SPEAKER_01: Minus your power point.
SPEAKER_03: My father.
SPEAKER_03: No, I know.
SPEAKER_02: People I worked for.
SPEAKER_02: Have a list of employees that you would like fired.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: For the remote.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe no.
SPEAKER_02: For technology.
SPEAKER_02: Closing.
SPEAKER_02: Cost or within the budget.
SPEAKER_02: Project is evaluated.
SPEAKER_02: Complete final questionnaire and meeting someone.
SPEAKER_02: That's it.
SPEAKER_02: I still have to do my minutes.
SPEAKER_02: So there will probably be another.
SPEAKER_02: Question air coming up.
SPEAKER_02: And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can.
SPEAKER_02: What goes on after that.
SPEAKER_02: That's the end of our meeting.
