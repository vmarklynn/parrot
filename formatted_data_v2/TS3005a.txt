SPEAKER_03: Good morning.
None: Thank you, I have you a chip over there man. Cotto?
SPEAKER_02: I have some sushi.
None: Yeah, its 1977.
SPEAKER_00: Sh Good morning. I'd like to welcome you to our first meeting. I've prepared a little presentation.
SPEAKER_00: My name is Marim Plonf and I hope you will introduce yourself in a few minutes as well.
SPEAKER_00: I'm the project manager of this project and well I will tell you fur on what actually is the project.
SPEAKER_00: This is the agenda for our first meeting. This is the opening. Then we will get, I will hope we will get acquainted with each other.
SPEAKER_00: We'll do a little tool training with these two things. We'll take a look at the project plan.
SPEAKER_00: There will be time for discussion. Actually we have to discuss because we have to create a product and then we will close this session.
SPEAKER_00: First of all, I'd like to introduce you to this room. As you probably have noticed there are little black fields on the table.
SPEAKER_00: You have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face.
SPEAKER_00: There are cameras everywhere around the room especially here for your face.
SPEAKER_00: This isn't a pie. It's a set of microphones and there are microphones here also. Please don't be afraid of them. They won't hurt you.
SPEAKER_00: I'm the project manager and I'm hoping for a good project. I'd like to hear who you are and what your functions are on this project.
SPEAKER_03: Let's start with the ladies. I'm Imkriel and my function is user interface design. I'm a industrial designer and I hope to look forward to a very pleasing end of this project.
SPEAKER_02: My name is Danny Magrale. I'm a marketing expert. My job is in the company to promote products to the customers.
SPEAKER_02: I also hope we have a pleasant work with each other.
SPEAKER_00: We have some expertise from different pieces of the company. That's good.
SPEAKER_00: As said, we're working on a project and the aim for that project is to create a new remote control which has to be original, trendy and user friendly.
SPEAKER_00: I hope we have the expertise to create such a project.
SPEAKER_00: The way we hope to achieve that is through the following methods. It consists of three phases, namely the functional design, conceptual design and detailed design.
SPEAKER_00: As you can see, all of these phases consist of two parts, namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss our work so far.
SPEAKER_00: But first, I will tell you something about the tools we have here. I already talked about the cameras and microphones, but they are not much use to us.
SPEAKER_00: We will have to take advantage of these two things. They are smart boards. As you can see, you can give a presentation on them.
SPEAKER_00: This one here is a white board. I will instruct you about that soon.
SPEAKER_00: As you also noticed, this presentation document is in our project folder. Every document you put in this folder is possible to show that here in our meeting room.
SPEAKER_00: There are available on both smart boards, but I think we will use this one for the document in the shared folder.
SPEAKER_00: As you can see, this is the same toolbar as is located here. The most functions we will use will be to add a new page to go back and forward between pages and, of course, to save it every now and then.
SPEAKER_00: This is the pen with which you can draw on the board. For instance, like this, everything is OK, but I have to put it on the pen.
SPEAKER_00: You can write things like test or whatever you want. As you can see, you have to move it a little bit slow. It is not such a fast board. It is a smart board, but also a slow board.
SPEAKER_00: You can write things, and, of course, you can also, when you click here, erase things, so we have asked left.
SPEAKER_00: You can also delete an entire page, but we ask you not to do that. Just simply create a new one and start all over because we want to save all the results.
SPEAKER_00: Does everyone understand this?
SPEAKER_00: You can erase anything. You can erase it with the eraser, but you shouldn't delete an entire page.
SPEAKER_00: You can delete a blank one, and I will delete this one now because we don't use it yet.
SPEAKER_00: You can, of course, erase when you make a mistake, but don't delete entire pages.
SPEAKER_00: Also, let's see, I think it's here, change the color of your pen. For instance, take a blue one and change the line with 5.
SPEAKER_00: And that's what you will need for our first exercise because I'm going to ask you to draw your favorite animal.
SPEAKER_00: It's also to guess to know each other because I'm asking three things for that drawing. To do it on a blank sheet with different colors, and I just showed you how to pick a color, and also with different pen widths, which I also showed you.
SPEAKER_00: And favorite characteristic can be just one word.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I'm not very good at drawing, but I will go first and try to draw.
SPEAKER_00: Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing.
SPEAKER_01: It's a sheep.
SPEAKER_03: It's a silver.
SPEAKER_03: A silver.
SPEAKER_03: A beaver.
SPEAKER_00: Well, it's weird.
SPEAKER_00: It could be everything.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe when I put on this thing, it could be a turtle snail.
SPEAKER_00: Or a snail.
SPEAKER_00: But the snail doesn't have legs.
SPEAKER_01: The turtle has.
SPEAKER_00: And those are slow.
SPEAKER_00: And I hope our project group will not be slow, but we will work to a good result and do it as fast as we can.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Time for another animal. Would you like to go next?
SPEAKER_02: It was forward.
None: That is so good.
SPEAKER_01: Oh.
SPEAKER_03: That helps.
SPEAKER_02: To make it a little bit easier.
SPEAKER_01: It's not that cute.
SPEAKER_01: Or a dinosaur.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's easy to recognize.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The favorite characteristic is the long neck.
SPEAKER_02: It can reach everything.
SPEAKER_02: I can also reach a lot with this project.
SPEAKER_00: That's my favorite animal.
SPEAKER_00: Anything else you need to know?
SPEAKER_01: I can draw with this.
SPEAKER_03: Wow.
SPEAKER_03: It's a mouse.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: You can guess what it is, I hope.
SPEAKER_01: It's a rabbit.
SPEAKER_01: Well, it's a quick, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: That's my favorite animal.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence, one of the most intelligent animals in our world.
SPEAKER_03: I can see we have some drawing sounds.
SPEAKER_00: Well, nice animals, nice words.
SPEAKER_00: Sounds good.
SPEAKER_00: Back to business, back to the money part.
SPEAKER_00: From the finance department, I've learned that we are aiming for a selling price of 25 euros and we're hoping for a aim of 50 million euros and we're hoping to achieve that by aiming for an international market.
SPEAKER_00: And the production costs will be 12 euro 50 max.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, well, it's time for some discussion.
SPEAKER_00: I've wrote down some examples here of what we can speak about, what's your experience with remote controls, what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control, maybe, for which market segments should be aimed or should be aimed for all segments.
SPEAKER_00: Well, actually, I'd like to hand the word back to you.
SPEAKER_00: What's your experience with remote control?
SPEAKER_01: A lot of buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Which you don't use.
SPEAKER_03: Complex.
SPEAKER_03: Complex.
SPEAKER_03: Not user friendly.
SPEAKER_01: You search for the buttons, which ones which.
SPEAKER_02: Boring.
SPEAKER_02: Boring.
SPEAKER_00: It's not fun to use in remote.
SPEAKER_00: Black or black.
SPEAKER_03: So, black colors.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Or maybe we should try to make it fun.
SPEAKER_03: We use batteries and last batteries and poor signal.
SPEAKER_03: The angle is to use.
SPEAKER_01: Different remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Different remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Different remote control.
SPEAKER_01: We can integrate them or something.
SPEAKER_03: For the use of different devices.
SPEAKER_01: Your stereo and your TV and the...
SPEAKER_01: That's nice.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but then again, you still have a lot of buttons.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's right.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but I think there's a possibility to put those buttons behind some kind of protection.
SPEAKER_03: So, if you only get serum when you need them.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_02: It's possible.
SPEAKER_02: So, do you only get...
SPEAKER_03: No, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_01: You just keep it tomorrow.
SPEAKER_03: For example, you get the same size remote control you use every day.
SPEAKER_03: And the usual buttons such as zapping, which is called a Dutch.
SPEAKER_03: And the following is the only possible buttons to use directly.
SPEAKER_02: Or the numbers.
SPEAKER_03: And the numbers, of course.
SPEAKER_03: But not the buttons used to search on the channels on your television.
SPEAKER_03: You're going to use those the first time.
SPEAKER_03: Play-balls.
SPEAKER_00: So, maybe a minimalist design.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I think so.
SPEAKER_01: Of buttons.
SPEAKER_01: But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it.
SPEAKER_01: That's a...
SPEAKER_01: Thanks for a...
SPEAKER_01: Tailor text.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know that.
SPEAKER_01: That's a name.
SPEAKER_03: Tailor text.
SPEAKER_03: Thanks.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So, you don't want to bother people with loads of buttons, but on the other hand, they need many buttons, so they don't have to get out of their seat.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think the market will be all kinds of people.
SPEAKER_02: All of the young people.
SPEAKER_01: But if it's international, you should look in Britain, they have different things they can do with TV.
SPEAKER_01: Or so that you can choose what you want to see.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if you should take that into consideration.
SPEAKER_01: It just should aim for the normal TV.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think that's better.
SPEAKER_02: I think if you're going to target a lot of people in the whole world and only Britain, then I think the cost will rise higher than 1250, I think.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I don't know if the...
SPEAKER_02: It was better to use the whole world in Britain.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: No, it could be...
SPEAKER_03: I think the main idea of this remote control is to make it user-friendly.
SPEAKER_03: So I think when the customers will buy this remote control, they already have the remote control, which companies...
SPEAKER_03: With the standard remote control, which comes with the television.
SPEAKER_03: So it only has to have the most used buttons.
SPEAKER_03: You don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television in those...
SPEAKER_03: Oh, but then you have to find your other remote control...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but it's impossible to accommodate all the buttons on the different televisions set on one remote control.
SPEAKER_03: It's impossible.
SPEAKER_03: For example, Sony Television has the opportunity to make possible for it to see on one side of the screen, teletext, on the other side, just a regular television.
SPEAKER_02: I think most television nowadays do this.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but they don't use the same signal on remote control, because you can use a Panasonic remote control on a phillips television.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but then you have to choose the...
SPEAKER_02: It's always a universal control mode.
SPEAKER_02: You have to choose the code.
SPEAKER_02: I'm choosing the code.
SPEAKER_02: I guess which type of television you have.
SPEAKER_02: There's no problem.
SPEAKER_02: I think the two pages on the same screen, like teletext and normal television, that's nowadays standard.
SPEAKER_03: I think most people...
SPEAKER_03: People will buy their remote control because they lost the first one.
SPEAKER_03: The first one is broken, so...
SPEAKER_03: Perhaps they haven't got an older television, so that option is not...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, definitely optional for those people.
SPEAKER_01: Then people have a new television, and if you look into the future, then they want to...
SPEAKER_01: It's very beautiful.
SPEAKER_03: So we should take that in consideration.
SPEAKER_03: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, well, any more ideas?
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_00: No, I think they'll come up.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, well, we have some time.
SPEAKER_00: Let's see.
SPEAKER_00: One more I have to tell.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think there's much left.
SPEAKER_00: Nope, we're starting to close.
SPEAKER_00: Our next meeting will start a little bit early, but our next meeting will start in 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_00: In the meantime, there's time for some individual actions.
SPEAKER_00: As you can see, the different roles have different tasks.
SPEAKER_00: And there's a ping.
SPEAKER_00: Is it my laptop?
SPEAKER_03: Yep.
SPEAKER_03: Stop the meeting.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, the meeting will come up in five minutes.
SPEAKER_00: Five minutes in the meeting, so we're right on schedule.
SPEAKER_00: The marketing expert will take a look at the user requirements specification.
SPEAKER_00: The user interface designer will work out the technical functions design.
SPEAKER_00: And this was the interface designer or the interaction designer?
SPEAKER_00: No, interface designer.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, first guess was right.
SPEAKER_00: We'll take a look at the working design.
SPEAKER_03: No, the industrial designer will take a look at the working design.
SPEAKER_03: Any usability interaction?
SPEAKER_03: Industrial design.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Let's just use the acronyms.
SPEAKER_00: And of course, specific restrictions will be sent to you for your personal coach.
SPEAKER_01: So I should look at what you should be able to do with your mouse or how?
SPEAKER_00: Well, those instructions will be in the email you will receive shortly, I hope.
SPEAKER_01: Me too.
SPEAKER_00: And of course, you have your own expertise.
SPEAKER_00: Well, that was what I had to say.
SPEAKER_00: Are there any more questions?
SPEAKER_00: No.
SPEAKER_03: No?
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I think then we have to head back to our offices and start working.
SPEAKER_00: I have a more question.
SPEAKER_02: One question?
SPEAKER_02: Where does it says we have to make a remote because I pursued.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, go.
SPEAKER_02: I didn't know who.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, no problem.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: I'll expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive shortly.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I'll see you all in about 30 minutes then.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Good.
None: That's very bad.
None: Yeah.
None: I can't do this, but I should do it.
None: I need to.
None: Okay.
