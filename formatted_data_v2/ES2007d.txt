SPEAKER_02: Play those edible. Did you know that?
SPEAKER_02: It's definitely...
SPEAKER_01: Because kids...
SPEAKER_03: I used to.
SPEAKER_03: I've definitely eaten it before. I didn't know it was edible.
SPEAKER_03: But it's... it's shoe proof.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's my edible because kids eat it.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if it wasn't edible, but...
SPEAKER_01: Well, no more babies.
SPEAKER_03: Actually, that makes sense because I remember like...
SPEAKER_03: I don't know if my mom ever did it.
SPEAKER_03: I remember other people's moms making.
SPEAKER_03: I played over. You just like make the...
SPEAKER_03: You can use coloring and mix and stuff.
SPEAKER_03: Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah, it is. Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_02: All right, everybody ready?
SPEAKER_02: Yep.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, let's have your...
SPEAKER_02: Let's get...
SPEAKER_02: Let's have the presentation.
SPEAKER_03: We've got a cool presentation.
SPEAKER_03: It's pretty exciting.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_03: Everything that we wanted, we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be...
SPEAKER_03: Made out of rubber.
SPEAKER_03: Very simple and easy to use.
SPEAKER_00: Double curved.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, double curved.
SPEAKER_03: But also something that was going to jump out at people, something that would be different.
SPEAKER_03: Separate it from the other...
SPEAKER_03: Remotes out on the market.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_03: I think if you put this in the palm of your hand...
SPEAKER_03: You'll see what a nice thing we have going in.
SPEAKER_03: That is cool.
SPEAKER_03: So basically...
SPEAKER_03: If you hold it like that, the one on your thumb...
SPEAKER_03: The thumb button is the power button.
SPEAKER_03: Index finger is channel up.
SPEAKER_03: Middle finger is channel down.
SPEAKER_03: Ring finger is volume up.
SPEAKER_03: Pinky is volume down.
SPEAKER_01: What's the big blue thing?
SPEAKER_03: That's the lock button.
SPEAKER_03: And then the M is a mute button.
SPEAKER_03: And then it also has...
SPEAKER_02: So what button?
SPEAKER_03: M for muting the...
SPEAKER_03: And also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the channel if you want.
SPEAKER_03: So it's really basic functionality as far as what keys are available.
SPEAKER_03: But I think it's really comfortable and innovative and it looks different.
SPEAKER_02: That certainly does.
SPEAKER_03: So all the important keys are right at your convenient place for you to access them.
SPEAKER_00: And T-R-S-I-M.
SPEAKER_03: It should be...
SPEAKER_03: And it's also conformable to the size of your hand.
SPEAKER_03: I mean if that's too big, it's a rubber remote.
SPEAKER_03: It's so cute.
SPEAKER_03: Is that...
SPEAKER_03: What... I'm not sure what you guys were hoping for and expecting.
SPEAKER_02: I have one thing about it.
SPEAKER_02: But it's a small thing but it means we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one.
SPEAKER_02: How about it?
SPEAKER_03: That's good thinking.
SPEAKER_02: But that's... I don't see why that's not possible.
SPEAKER_03: If we build rocket ships, why can't we build rocket ships?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It might left-handed scissors.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but then...
SPEAKER_03: I didn't think about that.
SPEAKER_01: But then you can learn to use your right hand.
SPEAKER_01: Like I was just thinking there's left-handed and right-handed in the family.
SPEAKER_01: What do they have to do?
SPEAKER_00: I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole...
SPEAKER_00: The same computer for the first family and they have a mouse.
SPEAKER_00: Sure.
SPEAKER_01: Everybody using right-handed.
SPEAKER_01: I know they'll be able to... I mean it's only pressing buttons.
SPEAKER_01: You don't have to do anything, you know, extraordinary.
SPEAKER_01: I think everybody can press a button within the left-handed and right-handed.
SPEAKER_00: Imagine... are you right-handed?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Imagine doing it with your left hand.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think it's too...
None: Yeah, it's not.
SPEAKER_00: But we can have both...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Have them in stock.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: They can make them more appealing.
SPEAKER_02: But other than that, I only know.
SPEAKER_02: That's just something I think.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's great. Yeah, great idea.
SPEAKER_03: Do you think it says...
SPEAKER_02: R-I?
SPEAKER_02: R-I think it's a...
SPEAKER_02: I think it's... well, if the R-I motto is, we bring fashion to the electronics.
SPEAKER_02: We like to make sure that it could be quite fashionable.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And it's got the black and yellow and blue.
SPEAKER_03: Plus red, which is sort of a fruit and vegetable.
SPEAKER_03: That's how it is.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So that's our inner things.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, very good.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's come up with the thing that's...
SPEAKER_02: what we were looking at doing, wasn't it?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The little seems to be there.
SPEAKER_02: Well done.
SPEAKER_01: The little playing around is...
SPEAKER_02: Before we move on...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'm just... do you want a bucket?
SPEAKER_02: I need that. Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: One thing I do need to do, we need to look at is the costs.
SPEAKER_03: The costs, is that what you said?
SPEAKER_00: The product was very cheap.
SPEAKER_02: Well, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I don't want to last very long.
SPEAKER_01: Everybody will go like, oh, this is gone.
SPEAKER_03: But it's edible.
SPEAKER_00: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_00: Cheap poop.
SPEAKER_01: Well, buy more of the meat.
SPEAKER_03: That was the main criteria from the last meeting.
SPEAKER_03: It had to be cheap-proof.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, now I think we'll do this.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I could do, you know, I can do this.
SPEAKER_02: Oh.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, my, I could do it with you.
SPEAKER_02: But it's just easy enough to go through it with you.
SPEAKER_02: So, we're going for the...
SPEAKER_02: Kinetic power.
SPEAKER_02: Yep.
SPEAKER_02: And the electronics we decided on it.
SPEAKER_02: Being just a simple, the easiest thing that's inside it.
SPEAKER_02: Oop.
SPEAKER_02: The case we've gone for the double-curved.
SPEAKER_02: And it's made out of rubber.
SPEAKER_02: The interface is push buttons.
SPEAKER_02: And buttons supplements.
SPEAKER_02: Well, they're different special colors, aren't they?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So, very special colors.
SPEAKER_01: Special form.
SPEAKER_02: Special form.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, they're special form.
SPEAKER_02: They're in shapes and stuff.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I mean, these ones on the side are curved.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: They're made out of any special material.
SPEAKER_02: No, they're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber.
SPEAKER_02: They're just simple.
SPEAKER_02: Well, they're rubber.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So, let's see if that comes within budget.
SPEAKER_02: And it does.
SPEAKER_02: That is going to cost...
SPEAKER_02: I don't know about it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's going to cost 10, 10 euros, 70 cents a unit to make.
SPEAKER_02: And our target was it had to come in at under 12.50.
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_03: Actually, making a better profit than the expected.
SPEAKER_02: This is all very, very good.
SPEAKER_02: The bosses will be very pleased.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, let's just say this.
SPEAKER_02: So, I can email it to me.
SPEAKER_02: So, it's very dynamic.
SPEAKER_02: No, I want to...
SPEAKER_02: It's so...
SPEAKER_02: I'm not...
SPEAKER_02: I'm not...
SPEAKER_02: I'm not...
SPEAKER_02: I'm not...
None: I'm not...
SPEAKER_02: Spended.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So, that's...
SPEAKER_02: That's me done with this...
SPEAKER_02: with this...
SPEAKER_02: do-da.
SPEAKER_02: I'm going to do what you were going to do.
None: No, evaluation.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: This is where we all get to.
SPEAKER_01: I get to write on the board.
SPEAKER_01: Oops, on the board.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: Oh.
SPEAKER_01: It's functioned.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, I love this man.
None: I played on...
None: Oh, I'm not...
None: Oh, I'm not...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I'm not...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I love this man. I played on...
SPEAKER_02: I can't...
SPEAKER_02: I can spell it.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So, evaluation.
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to do it all together.
SPEAKER_01: So, we evaluate it.
SPEAKER_01: Each criteria I've got the criteria is.
SPEAKER_01: And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven.
SPEAKER_01: One being true.
SPEAKER_01: So, it's more like it fits the criteria.
SPEAKER_01: And seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria.
SPEAKER_01: And the criteria is not...
SPEAKER_01: And I'll draw this up on the board.
SPEAKER_01: So, we have a box.
SPEAKER_01: Just so we know true.
SPEAKER_01: And this is false.
SPEAKER_01: This is just like...
SPEAKER_01: Keep you informed.
SPEAKER_01: So, seven is here.
SPEAKER_01: And one's here.
SPEAKER_01: And then you've got in the middle.
SPEAKER_01: So, the first criteria...
SPEAKER_01: Do you all get what we're doing?
SPEAKER_01: Okay, cool.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, first criteria.
SPEAKER_01: Look and feel.
SPEAKER_01: So, it does look and feel fashionable to what we talked about.
SPEAKER_01: Is it color-wise?
SPEAKER_01: And is it spongy?
SPEAKER_01: So, what mark should we give it for that?
SPEAKER_03: I would give it a seven.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: As in, it's not.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, sorry.
SPEAKER_03: One.
SPEAKER_01: One.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So, I'll just write criteria.
SPEAKER_01: Criteria one.
SPEAKER_01: Criteria one.
SPEAKER_01: Second criteria.
SPEAKER_01: New technology.
SPEAKER_01: How we implemented new technology within the new high tech.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: That was our main technological innovation.
SPEAKER_03: Everything else is fairly simple, but the fact that we use the kinetic energy.
SPEAKER_03: Also the...
SPEAKER_03: It's ergonomic.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, but that's not a technological thing.
SPEAKER_02: That's another thing.
SPEAKER_02: That's another marketing thing.
SPEAKER_02: So, on the technical side of it.
SPEAKER_02: I'd say it's about a two-ish.
SPEAKER_03: In the middle somewhere, maybe.
SPEAKER_01: Three.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Three, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Got a three.
SPEAKER_01: So, criteria three is...
SPEAKER_01: It's easy to use.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's a one.
SPEAKER_02: I'd say it's...
SPEAKER_02: I've not, if you're left-handed, it's not.
SPEAKER_02: I would give it a two.
SPEAKER_02: Two, so...
SPEAKER_02: Because it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people.
SPEAKER_01: But if we make a right-handed and left-handed then...
SPEAKER_03: If we're going to have one left-handed and one right-handed, then I would give it a one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Give it a two.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, criteria four is...
SPEAKER_01: Cost.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, on the budget.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's a definite one.
SPEAKER_02: That was great.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The amount of buttons...
SPEAKER_01: Like the amount of buttons, because people like a lot of letters.
SPEAKER_01: Only the necessary buttons.
SPEAKER_01: So it's a one?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Um...
SPEAKER_01: Criteria six.
SPEAKER_01: RSI is a good against.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Very good.
SPEAKER_01: It's an NC RSI.
SPEAKER_01: It's one.
SPEAKER_01: And criteria seven, which is the last one.
SPEAKER_01: Does it get lost?
SPEAKER_01: It's easy to get lost.
SPEAKER_02: I don't think it's going to get lost very freely.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: But it is flawless.
SPEAKER_03: It's not the kind of thing that's going to slip like between a couch cushion or something.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe it was.
SPEAKER_03: I think it would be good.
SPEAKER_03: It was a two.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's not fully, it's not fully like, can't say.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's not a one.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, you can still flush it down a toilet theoretically.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, anything.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, it's bigger than the average mobile, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But yeah, it can get lost.
SPEAKER_01: The mobile's getting lost all the time.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: But then you ring them.
SPEAKER_01: So.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So that's that.
SPEAKER_01: That's the evaluation.
SPEAKER_01: So I'd say.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, it's like, oh, system goes.
SPEAKER_01: Like a number one.
SPEAKER_01: Number one product.
SPEAKER_02: We can't fail.
SPEAKER_01: Fitted all the criteria.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Well done, Lisa.
SPEAKER_01: That's that one.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: I think I just want to put in as projects manager.
SPEAKER_02: You know, a little bit of praise for everybody here.
SPEAKER_02: But how they've worked on it.
SPEAKER_02: You know, both individually and as a team.
SPEAKER_02: You've everyone's come up with their own individual ideas and their own different departments.
SPEAKER_02: And then come together and work in, you know, integrally, you know, at the right times, you know, especially you too.
SPEAKER_02: That's all, you know, gone very, very well and and.
SPEAKER_02: You know, it's been good communication going on.
SPEAKER_03: And during our design, and there was some some heated, heated discussion, but we kept trying to keep it cool and.
SPEAKER_02: Did you have to go down to the corporate squash court and bash a few bills about.
SPEAKER_03: We just had to squeeze our product a little bit.
SPEAKER_03: Fantastic.
SPEAKER_03: Now you guys have been a great team.
SPEAKER_03: I think we're the envy of all the, of all the other teams.
SPEAKER_02: I think so, I think we've come up with something new, something that hasn't been done before.
SPEAKER_02: We're not just rehashing an old design.
SPEAKER_01: And for meetings, for the old design, the meetings could be this quick.
SPEAKER_02: You know, maybe this isn't a simulation.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe this is actually, it's like, I think they're so mean or someone like that.
SPEAKER_02: They're just, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: They get the.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, well, two years time, this will be on the market.
SPEAKER_02: Exactly that product.
SPEAKER_02: And we'll go, yeah, we design that and no one will believe us.
SPEAKER_03: So at this stage, I mean, is this the last meeting of the project?
SPEAKER_03: We don't have another one after it's gone.
SPEAKER_02: No, I think when this meeting's finished, like officially, they'll, we'll get a questionnaire.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, really?
SPEAKER_01: Just start summarizing now.
SPEAKER_01: I can reply to the same list.
SPEAKER_02: I'm got the message.
SPEAKER_01: See some way.
SPEAKER_01: Just reply to that one.
SPEAKER_03: So there's no way to like predict what our, because we had it, we originally had it.
SPEAKER_03: As far as our financial goals, we had a specific number for profits that we wanted.
SPEAKER_03: It was 50.
SPEAKER_01: Was it, was it still your five?
SPEAKER_03: I don't remember, but there's not a way to compete that.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, since we saved on the, on that production cost, do we know how much we're making on profit?
SPEAKER_02: It gets handed over to another department.
SPEAKER_02: Well, what our project was was to come up with the product.
SPEAKER_02: Basically, like the, and just basically is it, can, can, is it within budget?
SPEAKER_02: When it, when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and, you know, the, the profits and all that, that's other departments.
SPEAKER_02: It's another team that actually work out the, the, we have a vested interest in that.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The all that goes in the profit sharing.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's it.
SPEAKER_02: You know, we've, we've, we've made, we've designed the product.
SPEAKER_02: We've made, we've got the prototype.
SPEAKER_02: It's within budget.
SPEAKER_02: It's, does everything that we wanted it to do.
SPEAKER_02: It's new.
SPEAKER_02: It's, it's something that, that is now there already.
SPEAKER_03: I think actually in one advantage of this is that after the, you know, after this bad of fruit and vegetables passes, this will still be a cool remote, you know, we're not, we're not, you know, tying our cart to that one horse.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But this is very remarkable.
SPEAKER_02: And that it is, it's, it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people to want that.
SPEAKER_02: It's, that it's, I'm bringing it all right down here somewhere.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I put it in one of my emails that I sent off.
SPEAKER_02: That, you know, it's marksable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes are actually do give you a pest is strain injury.
SPEAKER_02: Our one does the complete opposite.
SPEAKER_02: You know, so that's something that's new, which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something new and makes watching TV healthy.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, and if you're not having a good time with the TV, you can throw it about, you know, it's fine.
SPEAKER_02: It's kid proof.
SPEAKER_01: Don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them.
SPEAKER_02: Well, you can break the ornaments, but you won't break that.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So all in all, I think we've done very well.
SPEAKER_02: Well done everybody.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You too.
SPEAKER_02: In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're, that we've all just gained access to.
SPEAKER_02: That's it.
SPEAKER_02: That's it.
SPEAKER_02: Well, as far as I know, that's it.
SPEAKER_01: I've got five minutes left.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: Everyone want to play us by?
SPEAKER_03: I guess it's probably better than we wrap it up and have five minutes of silence.
SPEAKER_03: Should we call it a day then?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I guess.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, we're going to get asked to fill out another questionnaire.
SPEAKER_02: It's probably going to be the same as one we've done before.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I'm not the authority to say that it is.
SPEAKER_02: How does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this?
SPEAKER_02: Sort of using the pens and writing on these special pads and all that?
SPEAKER_02: I love it.
SPEAKER_01: I love it.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's cool.
SPEAKER_01: You know, wide up vibrating pen and cool.
SPEAKER_01: Being watched.
SPEAKER_01: Your moment to shame.
SPEAKER_00: Well.
SPEAKER_02: You know, I didn't, yeah, as we said earlier, I've not never seen that before.
SPEAKER_02: Something that the whiteboard thingy.
SPEAKER_02: That's great.
SPEAKER_02: But a pen with a camera on it, I don't think it's such a new thing.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, it's all in such a new idea.
SPEAKER_02: It would be different if it was sort of handwriting, recognizing stuff.
SPEAKER_02: But as it's not, it's literally that will come up on the computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text.
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_03: I think they do want to give me an writing mechanism.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's just that we're stuck.
SPEAKER_01: Logitech.
SPEAKER_03: I guess we should end this as well.
SPEAKER_03: Off topic.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Meeting the joint.
SPEAKER_03: Right.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
