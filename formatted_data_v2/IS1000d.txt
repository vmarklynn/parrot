None: I guess you can do it.
SPEAKER_01: Did you get my email with the stats?
None: I'm going to change off.
None: I'm going to change off soon.
None: You're all right.
None: It's okay.
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to change off soon.
None: You're all right.
None: It's okay.
None: I guess I have to change the pen otherwise.
None: Can you come through to it?
None: Don't know.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe the pen is supposed to go over the seats.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe the seat is four rather than the person.
SPEAKER_01: Do you think?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
None: I'm going to do this.
SPEAKER_01: Yep.
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to do this.
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to do this.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to do this.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So, Marshall is late again.
SPEAKER_05: Probably an important man.
SPEAKER_05: So, well, it is important for him to be here.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So, what I do?
SPEAKER_05: You did work together.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So, I would be able to summarize our meeting.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: I think it would be very important if the as main designer will be important that he is here.
SPEAKER_05: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Basically, we designed two items.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, but we...
SPEAKER_00: Can we have a phone or can someone...
SPEAKER_05: Yes, we should phone him.
SPEAKER_05: It's really well designed.
SPEAKER_05: When he's not here, we will just have to continue.
SPEAKER_05: So, just for a record, I will take notes again.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: And...
SPEAKER_05: Well...
SPEAKER_05: First thing, I was...
SPEAKER_05: I got an email from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget.
SPEAKER_05: The budget of the 12 euro and 50 cents.
SPEAKER_05: He said to me, well, when you stay in, it's good.
SPEAKER_05: When you don't stay in, you have to redesign.
SPEAKER_05: There is no negotiation possible in this matter.
SPEAKER_05: So, we have to consider that.
SPEAKER_05: Good.
SPEAKER_05: So, maybe Anna, you can have your first thing.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, we had an evaluation until we had a design.
None: Hello.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Nice to meet you.
SPEAKER_05: Nice to meet you.
SPEAKER_05: Sure.
SPEAKER_05: Great, great.
SPEAKER_05: Well, maybe then you can start now with your designs.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So, I will start by the basic one that fits into eight euros, actually.
SPEAKER_00: Right, seven, eight euros.
SPEAKER_00: And, well, first, for both, they have a special shape.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe the designer can explain better than me.
SPEAKER_00: But it's like a surfboard.
SPEAKER_00: And you are supposed to surf to browse, to surf TV, maybe the web.
SPEAKER_00: And it's kind of interesting shape because unconsciously, people want to surf.
SPEAKER_00: And also, it's not too far from a mobile.
SPEAKER_00: So, people are used to that kind of shape.
SPEAKER_00: Don't take care too much about the color because we will...
SPEAKER_00: No, we are supposed to give some offers.
SPEAKER_00: So, here would be basically the infrared eye.
SPEAKER_00: Hi.
SPEAKER_00: Let the LED...
SPEAKER_00: The on-off button.
SPEAKER_00: Here would be the volume on the left.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So, easy to turn on and off.
SPEAKER_00: And so, this is a very cheap version.
SPEAKER_00: So, there are...
SPEAKER_00: Maybe you can carry on with you.
SPEAKER_02: Also, you have browsing the channels, actually.
SPEAKER_02: So, you can go up and down the channels.
SPEAKER_02: If you have a video or something, it can forward.
SPEAKER_00: How can you change from VCR to TV, by the way?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, no, no, no.
SPEAKER_02: This is a model with just a TV one.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, sorry.
SPEAKER_02: This is a standard TV one.
SPEAKER_02: We are not talking about that.
SPEAKER_02: So, and then we have usually...
SPEAKER_02: There are 12 keys, but we know that we have only 10 digits.
SPEAKER_02: And then we have an extra two for having...
SPEAKER_02: Or giving an option for having more than one channel.
SPEAKER_02: And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to go out through from that.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so, it's a very basic...
SPEAKER_02: It's a very basic minimal thing which is also available in the market.
SPEAKER_02: Actually, that's what it is that they...
SPEAKER_02: And it costs us to build this about 8 euros.
SPEAKER_05: Except for the special shape, the surfing board.
SPEAKER_05: It has a quite conventional layout of buttons.
SPEAKER_02: So, this one model and...
SPEAKER_02: Can I say?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, sure.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I like the volume control.
SPEAKER_02: That's good.
SPEAKER_02: This is a magic one, but right now we don't want to talk about that.
SPEAKER_02: It is a very futuristic.
SPEAKER_02: It's like a brain, machine interface and all this stuff.
SPEAKER_02: We are thinking about it in the future.
SPEAKER_02: It can come.
SPEAKER_02: So, it doesn't actually have buttons.
SPEAKER_02: So, that...
SPEAKER_02: Then what we look...
SPEAKER_02: Do you want to say?
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: This is a model, yeah.
None: I just...
SPEAKER_05: Look how it feels.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_05: It really feels like...
SPEAKER_05: Like a mobile phone.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Just sign.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, see.
SPEAKER_05: I really want to talk to it.
SPEAKER_05: But...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, you want to talk to that?
SPEAKER_05: So, but you continue with your gr...
SPEAKER_02: So, well, then the...
SPEAKER_02: This is a more...
SPEAKER_02: A little...
SPEAKER_02: A smooth and it gives you a lot of functionality in this way.
SPEAKER_02: So, all we have...
SPEAKER_02: You see that there are only 6 keys, but don't worry.
SPEAKER_02: They are doing the job of tool keys actually here.
SPEAKER_02: And so, they have more space, actually.
SPEAKER_02: And it's easy to...
SPEAKER_02: Use this.
SPEAKER_02: And...
SPEAKER_02: You have a...
SPEAKER_02: So, this is a standard URL infra-red I.
SPEAKER_02: And then you have a power button.
SPEAKER_02: It should volume what you have.
SPEAKER_02: And then, other than that, you have a channel up and down and the flow of pause or...
SPEAKER_02: Slow-those.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And then, you have LCD display here.
SPEAKER_02: And this is the functional thing which can change, like...
SPEAKER_02: It's a toggle switch, which could change the function.
SPEAKER_02: Say...
SPEAKER_02: It's a DVD player to tell if it's easy.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I can change it to...
SPEAKER_02: Instead of having many switches.
SPEAKER_05: And then you get feedback, fire, LCD...
SPEAKER_02: LCD can display, what is that on that?
SPEAKER_02: And...
SPEAKER_02: Well, you can have an integrated microphone over here.
SPEAKER_02: This is the...
SPEAKER_02:... or an button here.
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_02: Which can...
SPEAKER_02: Basically, you want to do a speech recognition and the channel or whatever information can be displayed here directly on the...
SPEAKER_02:...on your display.
SPEAKER_02: And here is a...
SPEAKER_02:... small LED, which is like blinking one, which tells you like...
SPEAKER_02: Are you running out of the battery and which is...
SPEAKER_02:... can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And...
SPEAKER_02: Well, then we have a cover, basically.
SPEAKER_02: Basically, you don't need much other time this.
SPEAKER_02: When you need, you can use it.
SPEAKER_02: And this gives additional fascinating that tomorrow you want, you can add a tactile thing to this cover, you know.
SPEAKER_02: For example, design and...
SPEAKER_05: But...
SPEAKER_05: But...
SPEAKER_05:... India...
SPEAKER_05:... when this is closed...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05:... will also cover up the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, it's basically to do that.
SPEAKER_05: But the LCD screen, I mean, is a very...
SPEAKER_05:...
SPEAKER_05:... well, an eye-attracting feature with...
SPEAKER_05: Actually, when you're watching the TV...
SPEAKER_02: Actually...
SPEAKER_02: When you're watching anything or listening to them, you hardly care about what is getting displayed here, you know.
SPEAKER_02: You want to...
SPEAKER_02:... and this gives a protection to the LCD, actually, giving a cover to that, actually.
SPEAKER_02: It gives a protection because when it falls down or something...
SPEAKER_02:... it is...
SPEAKER_02: It's more robust.
SPEAKER_02: It's more robust that way.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And you have very good chances.
SPEAKER_00: It's low weight.
SPEAKER_00: You have to see.
SPEAKER_00: The components we put inside it is very low weight.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So the cost is actually a bit more.
SPEAKER_00: It's...
SPEAKER_00: It's 16 frames.
SPEAKER_02: 16 euros.
SPEAKER_00: 16 euros, okay.
SPEAKER_01: So that's where outside the budget then.
SPEAKER_00: Then it's out of budget.
SPEAKER_00: The main point we talk about that with our manufacturer.
SPEAKER_00: And they say basically that the ASR system would be...
SPEAKER_00:... something like three frames per item.
SPEAKER_00: Three euros.
SPEAKER_00: So you also...
SPEAKER_00: That's on top of the 16 or is it part of that?
SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, part of that.
SPEAKER_01: So it takes it down to 13 euros without the state check ignition?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Well, if you can have...
SPEAKER_02: If you have new more ideas, we can add new more...
SPEAKER_02:... some more keys if you want to, you know.
SPEAKER_02: I think...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we should stick with a number of keys because if we add too much...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it should not be clapped, turning up everything.
SPEAKER_02: What's this one on the side?
SPEAKER_02: That's for the... it's kind of a LED for indicating your battery.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And as well as it's like a blinking one, you can keep it the same.
SPEAKER_01: I like the shape of them.
SPEAKER_01: I do like the size and the shape.
SPEAKER_05: Before talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible, maybe you can give us your...
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products, both of these two.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, the evaluation and also the evaluation criteria.
SPEAKER_05: So what is important to look at?
SPEAKER_01: Best guess what we've talked about already.
SPEAKER_01: From the marketing point of view, we just want to make sure that we've taken into account...
SPEAKER_01: Well, just...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05:... do it quickly if we all already...
SPEAKER_01: So it's just a short list of criteria on the things that we identified as being important to selling the product.
SPEAKER_01: We just go through these and rate them as a group, and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that.
SPEAKER_01: So I just average this score of those items.
SPEAKER_01: So these are the things we're identified as being important.
SPEAKER_01: The three things were look and feel, innovation and ease of use.
SPEAKER_01: They're three important components.
SPEAKER_01: Appealing to the correct demographic.
SPEAKER_01: So using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic.
SPEAKER_01: And then following the company motto, following the fashion trends and putting the end of the product as well.
SPEAKER_01: So we'll go through and put through those on the two products now and discuss them further and then evaluate them.
SPEAKER_05: No, why not discuss it now?
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So I've just got through on the whiteboard, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: I'm just going to come in.
SPEAKER_01: So the first one was really very far below budget.
SPEAKER_01: Would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have a high profit on it?
SPEAKER_01: It was running a make up to eight euros and we have a...
SPEAKER_05: Well, my personal view is when this one is eight euros, we must think how can we improve it.
SPEAKER_05: And then, I mean, you must just see it as we can still spend this four and a half euro.
SPEAKER_05: And because the selling price is already quite fixed on 25 euros.
SPEAKER_05: So we just have to offer as much as value for the customer he can have for 25 euro.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so looking for innovation.
SPEAKER_01: So bad.
SPEAKER_02: And now it's easy to use.
SPEAKER_00: Easy to use.
SPEAKER_00: Ojon's target.
SPEAKER_00: And trends.
SPEAKER_01: Are we following the idea of using the removable covers on these?
SPEAKER_01: Is that part of my thumb?
SPEAKER_05: We can still discuss that.
SPEAKER_05: And together with evaluating this, we might come with new ideas in adding things or removing options because they are too expensive.
SPEAKER_05: I've received a framework which we can do this.
SPEAKER_05: This is the latest price of our production unit for several components.
SPEAKER_05: So we can see whether the price is within the 12 euro worth 50 cents.
SPEAKER_05: So maybe we can start with this calling this one.
SPEAKER_01: Yep.
SPEAKER_01: So that's the thing.
SPEAKER_05: This is the first design.
SPEAKER_01: Another one's green.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so look and feel.
SPEAKER_01: Well, one is a brick and a pen again.
SPEAKER_01: There is another pen.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, get that one.
SPEAKER_01: One's bad and seven's the best.
SPEAKER_01: So one's true and seven's false.
SPEAKER_01: One's the best.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So I'll just gather one to seven.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So look and feel.
SPEAKER_05: Well, you already feel it pretty much, I think.
SPEAKER_05: In my opinion, if you really feel it's very good.
SPEAKER_05: It's very good in your hand.
SPEAKER_05: So I would consider two or maybe even one for feels.
SPEAKER_05: But that's just half.
SPEAKER_05: We should also consider the look.
SPEAKER_05: And then it looks quite conventional.
SPEAKER_05: Don't you agree?
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: On the scale, it's between functional and fancy.
SPEAKER_01: Basically, we're looking at.
SPEAKER_05: So say five.
SPEAKER_05: It's my opinion, but I don't know what to do.
SPEAKER_02: Well, I will give it to my wife.
SPEAKER_02: We have any way the way we have designed this like the surf.
SPEAKER_02: As we say, you know, it doesn't look as fine, but still, I will give four in that game.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, four maybe.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Then we should have one for.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
None: Yeah.
None: That's not.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Can you maybe fix the other?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: You should print like this, not like this.
SPEAKER_00: When you.
SPEAKER_02: No, it's the.
SPEAKER_02: No, can you get the batteries?
SPEAKER_02: No, no, that's falling down.
SPEAKER_01: That's not the ink.
SPEAKER_01: That one.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's not the ink.
SPEAKER_01: That's the, that, that one.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That's not.
SPEAKER_02: No, no, it's not that.
SPEAKER_02: It's here to close the battery.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: No, it should be.
SPEAKER_02: No, I think it's lost a battery.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: It's right.
SPEAKER_01: No, it's.
SPEAKER_01: It's still right, but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors.
SPEAKER_02: I think that another battery there.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You got a second.
SPEAKER_01: Troy.
SPEAKER_05: Oh, we got a tell.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, it has a.
SPEAKER_05: Perfect.
SPEAKER_01: Is that working?
SPEAKER_01: Did it come out?
SPEAKER_05: Good.
SPEAKER_01: Good.
SPEAKER_01: Because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working.
SPEAKER_01: It's just normal whiteboard marker, but it wouldn't be picked up in the actual whiteboard.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So.
SPEAKER_05: Then then.
SPEAKER_01: The other one.
None: Wow.
None: I think it's slightly better.
SPEAKER_01: It's hard to tell from us the first scene, but.
SPEAKER_05: When we want to include, I'm doubting about this component.
SPEAKER_05: It breaks in your game.
SPEAKER_02: No, actually, this is not going to protrude, actually.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: It's not a button.
SPEAKER_00: It's a lead.
SPEAKER_02: It's a lead, actually, which will be coming in a call.
SPEAKER_00: Actually, yeah, it should be embedded.
SPEAKER_00: It should be embedded there.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So it won't be really, you know, protruding or something.
SPEAKER_00: You can push it again.
SPEAKER_00: You can push it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The other thing is, it's the left hand one protruding because if people are left handed, the one needs other hands.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It works so well.
SPEAKER_02: No, it's not protruding, actually.
SPEAKER_02: It'll go embedded into that.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I'd say two or three for that one, personally.
SPEAKER_01: Which was three than two.
SPEAKER_05: I think the look is better, but the feel is worse.
SPEAKER_05: So I would also say this is four.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: But what do you think?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, it's fine.
SPEAKER_02: I think.
SPEAKER_02: No, just that the feel is that you, right now you don't see the feel because, I don't follow them, but if you press it quite inside, now like this.
SPEAKER_02: Now it's embedded one.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: This is how the embedded one is.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, it's basically the same shape.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's basically the same thing, actually.
SPEAKER_02: You will be.
SPEAKER_02: Except that in this...
SPEAKER_02: The very CD makes it better.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And you may have a slight thing for to follow.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's definitely more fancy than that one.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I would say two or three.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So consensus, two or three?
SPEAKER_05: Two.
SPEAKER_05: Two.
None: Yeah, two is good, yes.
SPEAKER_01: So two.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Innovation.
SPEAKER_01: First one.
SPEAKER_00: There is no innovation.
SPEAKER_00: The first one compared to what exists in the market.
SPEAKER_02: No, but except for the design of the surf.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: What feature should we actually include?
SPEAKER_01: Including a location kind of thing?
SPEAKER_01: I'm trying to find it.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's one of the feel.
SPEAKER_01: But there's no actual innovation in that at all.
SPEAKER_01: It's just a straight out remote control.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: The only innovation is to shape.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So there's no...
SPEAKER_01: That's a looking field thing though.
SPEAKER_01: It's not a technological innovation.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So I'd be up for seven for innovation.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And the second one is really state of the art.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: In terms of innovation.
SPEAKER_00: And with many more functionalities, can open and impose the...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it is.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: LCD screens.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: That's...
SPEAKER_05: Well, quite.
SPEAKER_00: Any of the squirting buttons and menu and programmable device behind this.
SPEAKER_00: You could put it at one or two.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: That's not right.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So what are the innovations?
SPEAKER_01: This got the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Automatics feature recognition.
SPEAKER_00: Is that in this one though?
SPEAKER_01: Is this...
SPEAKER_01: Because this is the...
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: There were two different options we discussed then.
SPEAKER_01: We discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget.
SPEAKER_05: We discussed it as you all designed it and then we all tried it.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So the cost for these were...
SPEAKER_01: Get in the budget.
SPEAKER_01: What was the cost for the first one?
SPEAKER_01: Eight euros?
None: Eight.
SPEAKER_00: Actually, we have to check again.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I do.
SPEAKER_01: And this one was 16 euros.
SPEAKER_02: 16 euros.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: Innovation for this one is two.
SPEAKER_01: One.
SPEAKER_02: It's not two.
SPEAKER_02: I would say two.
SPEAKER_00: Two.
SPEAKER_00: And to be one, what would we do in it?
SPEAKER_00: Actually, I don't see...
SPEAKER_00: Why?
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: One would be without a button.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Well, this feature recognition is a very good innovation.
SPEAKER_01: I believe it's a...
SPEAKER_01: So maybe...
SPEAKER_05: It's a...
SPEAKER_05: With the speech recognition.
SPEAKER_00: It's using speech recognition.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Give that.
SPEAKER_05: Give it a one.
SPEAKER_01: It works.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Then it's...
SPEAKER_05: I see one.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Ease abuse.
SPEAKER_00: So the first one is re-standouts, so everybody...
SPEAKER_00: Is used to it, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Can use it.
SPEAKER_02: They are used to it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So that's maybe a two for ease abuse.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Here, the main...
SPEAKER_00: The other one is quite easy.
SPEAKER_00: Though...
SPEAKER_02: Though it has more functionality, I think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it, actually.
SPEAKER_01: So maybe a three or four.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Actually, in fact, I think it will be...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe sometimes people get scared with the number of buttons.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but...
SPEAKER_00: There's...
SPEAKER_00: Like I would say three...
SPEAKER_00: Four.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Well, we have reduced the key, actually.
SPEAKER_02: You see.
SPEAKER_02: Three is fine.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Because it's...
SPEAKER_00: It's not like a big one with 100 buttons.
SPEAKER_02: Actually, the user has to put some effort to do use that, actually.
SPEAKER_02: It's not so easy.
SPEAKER_02: Like this one, the normal.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, but then when he used to it, it's quite easy.
SPEAKER_05: It's quite easy.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Initially there, there was a lot of effort.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Good.
SPEAKER_01: So three, how will it go to the target demographic?
SPEAKER_01: So we're still thinking 20 to 40 year olds?
SPEAKER_00: 20 to 40, yes.
SPEAKER_00: This one would be for grandmothers.
SPEAKER_02: No, this would...
SPEAKER_02: I would give this model to the whole people.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, one mother's, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So it completely changed our demographic there.
SPEAKER_01: It's not part of the funky young thing.
SPEAKER_01: Except for the surfing shape.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, that's something with...
SPEAKER_05: As an appeal on this group, I think...
SPEAKER_01: If it was the very bottom price range, it was like between this and another one, which did the same thing.
SPEAKER_01: Then I can imagine it being a part of the demographic, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But it's still...
SPEAKER_05: After this, we can consider, for instance, making this more attractive to the demographic.
SPEAKER_01: So I've got room, but some budget there to add a few things to it.
SPEAKER_05: But as it is now, I would say...
SPEAKER_05: Six?
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Do you agree?
SPEAKER_02: I like the movie.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, because it's so important.
SPEAKER_00: It was written that it was so important, the look and taking care of.
SPEAKER_00: It targets the right range of people.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But if you sell it in the market, it's going to be cheap, actually.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But it's going to be cheap, whatever, though.
SPEAKER_01: It was set with it.
SPEAKER_02: And people can still decide to use a cheaper one.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Instead of a...
SPEAKER_00: But for us, we have a concern that we need to sell at 25 euros.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: There's nothing that would make me spend an extra few euros in that one rather than another one.
SPEAKER_05: Just paying 25 euros.
SPEAKER_05: I mean, it's not going to be cheaper.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so in that case, well, it's fine.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And the demographic of the second one?
SPEAKER_02: The demographic of the...
SPEAKER_01: It's got the toys in it.
SPEAKER_01: It's got the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_05: I think it's better because of the LCD screen, which really can appeal only on the...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05:... on the yep sign on the...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And if you want to target...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, if we wish to sell four millions of this, I think for these agents, we need absolutely the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_00: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_05: So, you also need screen tracks.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Especially if we can have an LCD screen and a low range product and that's good.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Maybe that's something to consider.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So, what...
SPEAKER_01: I'd probably go with three again for that one.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think it has more market.
SPEAKER_02: Even one and two.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You know, I've saved you two.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Two.
SPEAKER_02: Two, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Tomorrow, this will be more appealing because you can add a lot of investigation on that.
SPEAKER_02: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_02: Because then you have it...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You have a lot of things which you can include for the people.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And especially, I guess, this is the speech recognition as well.
SPEAKER_01: And that makes it more appealing, it's more of a new fun toy.
SPEAKER_02: We have to practically test it.
SPEAKER_02: The field test will tell you how good...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Okay, you find a point.
SPEAKER_05: And...
SPEAKER_01:... that's fine.
SPEAKER_01: So, the trends were the fruit and vegetables and there's bungee feel.
SPEAKER_04: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_01: So, as it is, not really doing either of them.
SPEAKER_00: I think spongy...
SPEAKER_00:... that means that it goes in the water.
SPEAKER_01: Well, spongy could be part of the field of the buttons as well.
SPEAKER_01: I know some...
SPEAKER_01:... who tried the mobile phones that have got the kind of spongy buttons?
SPEAKER_01: Not exactly spongy, but...
SPEAKER_01: I'm thinking one of the knockiest, it's got like...
SPEAKER_01:... you can't...
SPEAKER_01:... have got individual buttons, it's got just a...
SPEAKER_01:... bit on it and so it can...
SPEAKER_01:... that feels kind of spongy.
SPEAKER_00: This one includes this feature, right?
SPEAKER_00: Spongy buttons.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's sort of...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it's sort of...
SPEAKER_02:... that way it can be.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: And maybe in the corner we can make it...
SPEAKER_00:... a foot and a veggie.
SPEAKER_01: But that's if you're using the covers.
SPEAKER_05: And then we can...
SPEAKER_05: Oh, is this...
SPEAKER_05: Yes, we can consider...
SPEAKER_05: Is it possible, do you think, to make a cover for such a phone?
SPEAKER_01: Well, they make up for mobile, so it can't be that much more.
SPEAKER_02: I do want to cover that, actually.
SPEAKER_05: Just with a flexible plastic...
SPEAKER_01: So you've got the option of having different colours or different textures?
SPEAKER_01: This is possible.
SPEAKER_02: Uh...
SPEAKER_02:... it's...
SPEAKER_02:... any shows?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I think it should be possible, like what you do with the mobile.
SPEAKER_05: Or just two things which can be put on each other.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, if I do like...
SPEAKER_00:... not careful.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, I do like it.
SPEAKER_05: Alright.
SPEAKER_05: So...
SPEAKER_05:... maybe we can...
SPEAKER_05:... but we have to decide that we can put the...
SPEAKER_05:... fancy look of vegetables, for instance, to do these covers.
SPEAKER_05: And now try to invest in the features.
SPEAKER_05: I think the...
SPEAKER_01:... if we do the covers, that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in electronics.
SPEAKER_01: It lets you follow the latter's fashion.
SPEAKER_01: Even next year when Frid and Besh will not be out, you'll still be able to cover that and then it'll still be in fashion.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Because sometimes, look at this computer.
SPEAKER_00: This laptop is all black.
SPEAKER_00: And it's quite conventional.
SPEAKER_00: And sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours, like...
SPEAKER_00:... there's some presented here.
SPEAKER_00: So maybe we could do...
SPEAKER_00:... like in the range of the set of...
SPEAKER_00:... what we propose, a black one.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Very standard one.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And then the requirements of such people that want to really stand out things.
SPEAKER_01: And then you have the option of having different colours.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So that would make the trends equal, so we...
SPEAKER_05:... we really don't have...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's the feature that could be included in either of them.
SPEAKER_01: Although it is more with the spandy buttons on the other ones.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So a point better for the...
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So...
SPEAKER_01: Two and three, or one or two?
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Say one, two.
SPEAKER_05: One, two.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So I like to see...
SPEAKER_05:... so...
SPEAKER_05:... these are one of the spandy buttons.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So there's...
SPEAKER_00:... one of the spandy.
SPEAKER_00: Hmm.
SPEAKER_05: I see.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So the average of that is...
SPEAKER_01:... three, six, nine, about a five.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01:... just added.
SPEAKER_05: One by six.
SPEAKER_01: One by six.
SPEAKER_01: One by six.
SPEAKER_01: One by five.
SPEAKER_01: One by six.
SPEAKER_02: One by eight, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: This one, eleven, thirteen, nineteen, twenty-one.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, five is four point two.
SPEAKER_01: One point two.
SPEAKER_01: Very good.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: But we still have a very different price to those two.
SPEAKER_01: So they're not really comparable yet anyway.
SPEAKER_05: We must try to get them closer.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Both of them here.
SPEAKER_05: Or we just have to choose and adapt.
SPEAKER_05: Because when we choose for this one, we have to...
SPEAKER_05:... we have to make it more attractive.
SPEAKER_05: And when we choose for this one, we have to make it more cheap.
SPEAKER_01: Well, it's easy to make that one cheaper by just taking this bit recognition out.
SPEAKER_01: That'll basically take us down to the budget.
SPEAKER_05: But I...
SPEAKER_05: Now, did you work with the same prices as I have here?
SPEAKER_00: So I give, you know, I just give a call with the money fixture and I expand them and they turn me.
SPEAKER_00: This could be possible for six euros.
SPEAKER_00: Unfortunately, we didn't see this shit.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Matthew.
SPEAKER_00: So maybe we have to recap with this one.
SPEAKER_02: Have you had to reconsider everything with this?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Well, yes.
SPEAKER_05: Well, you reconsider.
SPEAKER_05: So let's try to model this phone in this heat.
SPEAKER_05: What kind of energy source?
SPEAKER_05: We didn't speak about that.
SPEAKER_05: It's a normal battery or...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it might... it'll need more than a conventional one.
SPEAKER_02: It won't be a... just...
SPEAKER_02: Maybe you might use a AA battery actually.
SPEAKER_02: What do you say?
SPEAKER_00: For this one, it's a normal battery.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, just one battery.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Electronics.
SPEAKER_05: Now, given speech recognition, I think you should go for your fans chip.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Some person.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Simple sensor, yes.
SPEAKER_05: Simple.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, this one.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, this one.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Case.
SPEAKER_05: Um...
SPEAKER_05: So...
SPEAKER_05: Cloud...
SPEAKER_02: Double Cloud, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I see.
SPEAKER_02: Double car.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's going to be more than just the basic case, definitely.
SPEAKER_00: So which one are we talking to?
SPEAKER_02: Are you talking about these or that?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, we are talking about...
SPEAKER_05: But they have the same shape, but...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So it's going to be not basic cases.
SPEAKER_05: So this would be double carves?
SPEAKER_04: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Uh, Plashtik would be a...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, the basic one.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Zero.
SPEAKER_00: Zero French.
SPEAKER_02: Special carves.
SPEAKER_02: Uh...
SPEAKER_05: Special car, now we leave to the carves.
SPEAKER_01: Uh...
SPEAKER_01: So now we're going...
SPEAKER_01: Bush Button or LCD...
SPEAKER_01: LCD display.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: I see the display.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It's okay.
SPEAKER_01: Just say, LCD display.
SPEAKER_01: Is that price per unit or for the whole...
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, now this is per unit.
SPEAKER_05: So with names...
SPEAKER_02: There's a number of components.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we made me the scroll.
SPEAKER_02: We'll write for that.
SPEAKER_00: No, but for this one, it's true.
SPEAKER_02: No, for that one also.
SPEAKER_00: The author?
SPEAKER_00: So, yeah, that's the scroll.
SPEAKER_05: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
SPEAKER_05: Yes, well, probably.
SPEAKER_05: So this comes to 18.
SPEAKER_01: And that's without any special button supplements.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, one scroll really.
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_01: So we'd have special colour, special form, special material, and all of them.
SPEAKER_01: I don't understand about them.
SPEAKER_05: So, I think...
SPEAKER_05: But do you agree that this...
SPEAKER_05: Wait a minute.
SPEAKER_00: It's not double curved.
SPEAKER_00: It's single curved, right?
SPEAKER_00: Because there is no...
SPEAKER_00: But I thought it would be curved on too.
SPEAKER_01: So it's curved on the size and curved on the top of the bottom.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I understand what you mean here.
SPEAKER_04: I understand what you mean here.
SPEAKER_00: So, there is only...
SPEAKER_00: There is nothing like...
SPEAKER_00: You know, in the other stuff...
SPEAKER_00: You're talking about concave curves.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, concave.
SPEAKER_00: So I think we can put...
SPEAKER_00: You think a single curved?
SPEAKER_00: A single curved, like 16.
SPEAKER_00: That makes 17.
SPEAKER_00: And whether the...
SPEAKER_00: Buttons, we have tried buttons, are you sure?
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: We have more, we've got the scroll wheel on the side.
SPEAKER_01: So I had a bad extension.
SPEAKER_00: Bad extension.
SPEAKER_00: Bad extension.
SPEAKER_00: We have...
SPEAKER_05: We haven't talked about a lot, but that's not...
SPEAKER_05: A lot is very inexpensive, I believe, but it's not in the list.
SPEAKER_01: We've got a scroll wheel for the bottom, don't we?
SPEAKER_01: Or is it some other thing that's not on there?
SPEAKER_05: Is this a scroll wheel or is this a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides?
SPEAKER_05: So far.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, we've only got five minutes left, guys, so we need to wrap it up pretty fast.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, you can scroll to it.
SPEAKER_01: So this is more than the...
SPEAKER_01: And the cost you gave for 16 years?
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so based on that, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Where is that?
SPEAKER_00: Yes, I'll get some of this picture.
SPEAKER_02: That is the sample sensor and sample speaker.
SPEAKER_05: So...
SPEAKER_00: Let's do that.
SPEAKER_02: We just need that, actually.
SPEAKER_02: Where... we need one.
SPEAKER_05: We could go for the... for the... for a simple chip, but then we can't have the speech recognition, yes?
SPEAKER_00: No, we can't, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So when we...
SPEAKER_05: But this would be cutting the speech recognition.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but if you have the near-the-rcd, you can choose... select between... you know, universal between audio, TV and VCR.
SPEAKER_00: And this needs a... needs an advanced chip.
SPEAKER_00: Transchip.
SPEAKER_00: Right?
SPEAKER_00: Hi.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, you're on a chip?
SPEAKER_02: I think it's going to be...
SPEAKER_00: I think it's going to be...
SPEAKER_00: I think it's regular.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's going to be...
SPEAKER_00: You can do that.
SPEAKER_05: With the regular chip, yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, it's a regular chip.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah, it's a regular chip.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's a regular chip.
SPEAKER_00: So... and what about the number of buttons?
SPEAKER_05: Just... that... maybe...
SPEAKER_05: Well, we can just say...
SPEAKER_05: Matthew.
SPEAKER_04: Uh...
SPEAKER_00: What is this?
SPEAKER_00: When...
SPEAKER_00: When you look at this... this... item...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah?
SPEAKER_05: Okay, look, we just... when we just want to... to cut the number of buttons, we have to make 7 to fit in 12... 1250.
SPEAKER_05: So is it possible?
SPEAKER_01: I... but the 7 basic buttons... or 7 buttons that any adds on...
SPEAKER_01: Without special colors or form or material.
SPEAKER_02: Well, we... then we have to ask the user to press itself.
SPEAKER_00: You're gonna make a phone to your boss saying 2550 is really...
SPEAKER_00: Pffft...
SPEAKER_00: Ha ha ha ha ha ha...
SPEAKER_05: No, no, no, ha ha ha...
SPEAKER_01: Ah ha...
SPEAKER_01: So the LCD place is three francs.
SPEAKER_01: Sorry, three euros.
SPEAKER_01: Five-sef.
SPEAKER_00: And we don't want to change that right.
SPEAKER_00: And we really want to add the LCD otherwise we wouldn't get the market.
SPEAKER_00: Otherwise...
SPEAKER_05: You are very normal...
SPEAKER_05:...thing like this.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So... 12 euro 50.
SPEAKER_01: We got two off of the battery.
SPEAKER_01: We can't do anything about that.
SPEAKER_01: So, 1050.
SPEAKER_01: What else do you have to write the display?
SPEAKER_01: That's 750.
SPEAKER_01: So, a 750 to use for the case and for the buttons.
SPEAKER_04: And the chips.
SPEAKER_01: So, the chips.
SPEAKER_01: Up there already.
SPEAKER_01: So, we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget.
SPEAKER_01: There's no doubt about that.
SPEAKER_00: So, what each of us think about the...
SPEAKER_00:...because it's a major point in the LCD.
SPEAKER_00: Do you think it's important?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, we could even replace them by buttons.
SPEAKER_00: Because sometimes when you watch the TV in fact you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more on your hands.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know.
SPEAKER_00: Actually, it depends.
SPEAKER_02: It depends what kind of functionality you want to add into it.
SPEAKER_02: For example, if you add two more functionality, then better you add two more buttons there.
SPEAKER_02: Instead of LCD display.
SPEAKER_02: Which is that is going to bring the cost by two euro at least.
SPEAKER_01: I think unless we can really drive these prices down, we need to get rid of the LCD display.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So, we can get rid of it and then add...
SPEAKER_02:...but we want that.
SPEAKER_00: On the market point of view, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: What do you think LCD is a major feature?
SPEAKER_00: For the price, it's going to be what we can afford.
SPEAKER_01: And it's looking like we can't afford the LCD display.
SPEAKER_01: There's no way we can get it in there.
SPEAKER_05: I think we have to come to a decision now.
SPEAKER_05: I think what we just do is fold.
SPEAKER_05: About the LCD display.
SPEAKER_00: You assume you want a democratic voice?
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_05: One man, one fold.
SPEAKER_05: So, who thinks the LCD display should be in it?
SPEAKER_01: I'd like to be in, but I can't see it happening.
SPEAKER_01: I think, but...
SPEAKER_01: You have power, a veto anyway, as project manager.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that.
SPEAKER_01: Well, we have to make a decision now.
SPEAKER_05: Yes.
SPEAKER_05: So, having an LCD display is just a very limited amount of buttons.
SPEAKER_05: Is that acceptable?
SPEAKER_05: Can your functions be implemented in...
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_05: You agree?
SPEAKER_05: So, having seven buttons instead of twelve.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: So, that would be cutting, say about these buttons.
SPEAKER_00: Because one...
SPEAKER_00: Show me that.
SPEAKER_00: Actually, we could, in fact, remove these three buttons and have three possibilities for each of the three here.
SPEAKER_00: Here one at the middle and...
SPEAKER_01: I think we're really losing as of years.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: That would create another problem.
SPEAKER_02: But the people to use it is not going to be easy.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So, I think we should go to LCD screen.
SPEAKER_05: That's my opinion.
SPEAKER_05: No, it's okay.
SPEAKER_02: You cut the LCD scene and introduce two more buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So, LCD is out.
SPEAKER_01: The speed rig out now, we've...
SPEAKER_00: The speed rig condition is ours.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Because of the budget.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Now we can just...
SPEAKER_01: So, I'll be basically back to the original one now.
SPEAKER_01: Back to the first version.
SPEAKER_01: Which turns out to be on budget exactly pretty much with these new costings.
SPEAKER_01: So, just look at that one and look at that one now.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_05: I think we just go for this one.
SPEAKER_05: That now 12 euro is the price.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: So, we're glad that it's 50 cents.
SPEAKER_05: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Cheap reduction.
SPEAKER_00: So...
SPEAKER_00: We wouldn't need the really expert designers.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Because they're home.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So, we can go back and talk to the suppliers.
SPEAKER_01: We see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in.
SPEAKER_01: But that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment.
SPEAKER_05: Okay.
SPEAKER_05: Good.
SPEAKER_05: Then we have for the change.
SPEAKER_04: Thank you.
SPEAKER_04: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: That was it.
SPEAKER_04: That's it.
None: Thanks.
None: Cool.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Finally, the design.
None: I need a left sheet.
