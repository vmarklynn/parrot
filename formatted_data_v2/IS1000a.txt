SPEAKER_00: Okay. Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: I'll just flip it on the...
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So, good morning, everyone.
SPEAKER_00: Welcome at the kickoff meeting of our latest project.
SPEAKER_00: I hope you all have been updated about it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Good.
SPEAKER_00: I'm going to do a little bit of a quick introduction.
SPEAKER_00: This meeting with an agenda as presented here.
SPEAKER_00: After the opening, we will get acquainted to each other.
SPEAKER_00: See what our roles are in this project.
SPEAKER_00: So...
SPEAKER_00: We have been provided with some technical tools to...
SPEAKER_00:...communicate and to...
SPEAKER_00:...well, learn from each other's plans, as I can say.
None: So...
SPEAKER_00: We will also try to...
SPEAKER_00:...to get acquainted to these tools.
SPEAKER_00: So, they are also new to me.
SPEAKER_00: I don't know whether you've worked with them before.
SPEAKER_00: Then we will come to the actual project plan.
SPEAKER_00: I hope it's about the new remote control we are going to.
SPEAKER_00: Going to the design.
SPEAKER_00: Then we will discuss...
SPEAKER_00:...well, how it should be and...
SPEAKER_00:...what our new project should look like.
SPEAKER_00: And then, after some 25 minutes, I hope we can end this meeting.
SPEAKER_00: So...
SPEAKER_00:...basically, this is about a new remote control.
SPEAKER_00: When you design a new project, you of course want it to be original.
SPEAKER_00: We want to be distinguished.
SPEAKER_00: People want to look at the shelf.
SPEAKER_00: Well, that's the product I need.
SPEAKER_00: So, it needs to be trendy.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, trendy is what people want, so then they will buy our project.
SPEAKER_00: But then, it also should work user-friendly.
SPEAKER_00: And otherwise, people...
SPEAKER_00:...well, it will not be rated very well in consumer articles, like that.
SPEAKER_00: So, the general outline of a new project will be...
SPEAKER_00:...we first go through a functional design phase.
SPEAKER_00: You all get certain tasks in this phase.
SPEAKER_00: And then we will meet again and discuss this functional design.
SPEAKER_00: And the same holds for the two phases.
SPEAKER_00: After this, the conceptual design.
SPEAKER_00: And after that, a more detailed design in which the final project should get...
SPEAKER_00:...is definitely the shape.
SPEAKER_00: But first, we will do some two frames.
SPEAKER_00: In all in front of you, you see the notebooks and not blocks.
SPEAKER_00: And we have here a whiteboard.
SPEAKER_00: And, well, it should work.
SPEAKER_00: I've read it from some colleagues.
SPEAKER_00: I should work with some kind of toolbar. I didn't find out yet how it worked.
SPEAKER_00: But maybe one of you did, so...
SPEAKER_04: And the documents in the shared folder.
SPEAKER_00: Yes. Do we have to say something about that?
SPEAKER_00: I'm not fully updated about this shared folder.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I guess we'll have a shared folder with documents that can share.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, well, we'll then find out how it works.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Well, this seems to me as some computer program, but I didn't find it yet.
SPEAKER_00: So, we'll come to that later.
SPEAKER_00: So, now we will try out the whiteboard we have here.
SPEAKER_00: So, I would suggest...
SPEAKER_00: Each of us is going to...
SPEAKER_00: Well, yes.
SPEAKER_00: We try to draw on it and then...
SPEAKER_00: Well, it should be smart some way.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not really sure how this works.
SPEAKER_00: Okay. Shall I stop?
SPEAKER_02: Yes, I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard.
SPEAKER_02: But they'll be recording.
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_01: Now they will record through that, in a sense, so that we just need to record the strokes.
SPEAKER_02: But for us it's just like a normal whiteboard.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_04: But it's...
SPEAKER_04: Actually, I think I can't grow with...
SPEAKER_00: You...
SPEAKER_00: Doesn't it work?
SPEAKER_00: Maybe some... maybe Anna, maybe you can start and you can maybe find out.
SPEAKER_00: To get a score, right?
SPEAKER_00: I have to draw...
SPEAKER_00: Why don't you draw your favorite animal on the whiteboard?
SPEAKER_02: My favorite animal.
SPEAKER_02: Sorry, it's a little time, but up here.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, I see...
SPEAKER_03: There we go.
SPEAKER_00: So, draw it. We will try to guess what it is.
SPEAKER_02: I'm a very bad drawer.
SPEAKER_03: Weird.
SPEAKER_02: You're not going to be able to guess from my drawing.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not going to be a bad drawer.
SPEAKER_02: There, ears, by the way.
SPEAKER_02: No?
SPEAKER_02: Close side.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so, like a pet animal.
SPEAKER_02: Like a cat.
SPEAKER_00: It's like a cat. So, I guess it's a cat.
SPEAKER_02: No, not a cat though.
SPEAKER_00: What is this now?
None: You forgot about him.
SPEAKER_04: You're on the knife?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think it's fine.
SPEAKER_01: I just don't want to cut it off.
SPEAKER_01: And this wire, no?
SPEAKER_01: We need a wireless microphone.
SPEAKER_01: You know?
SPEAKER_01: Especially, we should next pause it.
SPEAKER_01: We should take it like that.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, sorry.
SPEAKER_00: That's the cat.
SPEAKER_00: It's not a cat.
SPEAKER_00: It's a dog.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: So good. That's also kind of cat.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, the dog doesn't have a tail?
SPEAKER_02: It's got a tail in.
SPEAKER_01: Both predators, sure.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I thought so. The dogs have a tail.
SPEAKER_01: It's all for the cats.
SPEAKER_02: Did you?
SPEAKER_03: And he gets cast out of tail.
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, I think I will go without it.
SPEAKER_04: Right?
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: It will still not extend, right?
SPEAKER_01: It's not up to that.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So, what?
SPEAKER_02: Favorite characteristics?
SPEAKER_02: Dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun.
None: Oh.
None: What's that?
None: To another ski.
SPEAKER_01: Of course.
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: This is why you're the designer.
SPEAKER_02: Am I marketing?
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Definitely a whore.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: Very good.
SPEAKER_04: So, yes, with different colors.
SPEAKER_01: So, ah.
SPEAKER_01: I think you can put that.
SPEAKER_04: We can spend weeks.
None: I'm at 20.4.
None: Is it there?
SPEAKER_03: Yes, sir.
SPEAKER_03: So, no, it's zero.
SPEAKER_02: A blue and black zebra.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Again, you can meet him in Africa, I think.
SPEAKER_00: Very good.
SPEAKER_02: Very rare blue zebra.
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, I love.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's true.
SPEAKER_01: I have to go clear off my...
None:...lilence.
None: Don't need to talk about that.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: Sir.
SPEAKER_02: You've got a lot of room here, you probably.
SPEAKER_02: Rich.
SPEAKER_02: It's not for them.
SPEAKER_00: I hope you have some space in here, the horse of...
SPEAKER_00:...Meal.
SPEAKER_01: Sir, what did I draw?
SPEAKER_01: We have already taken the pen.
SPEAKER_02: That's a good dog.
None: Really?
SPEAKER_02: A mouse?
None: Oh, no.
SPEAKER_00: This looks like a cat who has been driven over.
SPEAKER_00: A cat?
SPEAKER_01: You always play with it.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_04: And we should sum up its favorite characteristics, right?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, some cats would be...
None:...the cats.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, the mooftars.
SPEAKER_00: So, that's the leek cat?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: They like to sleep, that's why you said you...
SPEAKER_04:...they are like this.
None: It's easy to just take a rest to me.
SPEAKER_00: It's quite, you know, relaxed situation.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's quite relaxed today.
SPEAKER_01: It's like a...
None:...they're very good at sex for you.
SPEAKER_01: That's okay.
SPEAKER_04: So, you have some small legs.
SPEAKER_00: Thank you, Matthew.
None: Oh, that's kind of bad here.
SPEAKER_04: Thank you, Matthew.
SPEAKER_02: It's a very big rat, very small rat.
SPEAKER_01: I hope they get something.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, this is certain...
SPEAKER_00:...some contribution to our positive name.
SPEAKER_00: So, let's see which animal has not been drawn yet.
SPEAKER_00: So, you've all drawn bland animals, so why not draw an animal in water?
SPEAKER_04: Okay, in the water.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what that is.
SPEAKER_02: It's a bit hard to guess.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Put it in colors, maybe to the help.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: The cat is going to eat the fish or the...
SPEAKER_04:...different bandwidth.
SPEAKER_00: So...
SPEAKER_02: Oh, it's a shark now.
SPEAKER_04: It's a shark, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yes. Why not?
SPEAKER_00: Good idea.
SPEAKER_01: I could maybe shark it goes to me.
SPEAKER_01: It's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish.
SPEAKER_02: No, it's a swordfish.
SPEAKER_04: You have something in Australia, right?
SPEAKER_04: Swordfish?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe.
SPEAKER_02: Another same one.
SPEAKER_00: I hope it still works.
SPEAKER_04: I'm sorry.
SPEAKER_04: So, I don't know if we need to spend time on that, actually.
SPEAKER_00: Well, this tool seems to work.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, exactly.
SPEAKER_00: Let's continue to do real stuff.
SPEAKER_00: Our project finance thing.
SPEAKER_00: When we are...
SPEAKER_00:...and when you are going to design, we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product will be about 25 euros.
SPEAKER_00: When designing a project, I also look at you a mile.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Keep in mind, people want to get the feeling this is a 25 euro project.
SPEAKER_00: Peruent control?
SPEAKER_04: Yeah, project.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: More interesting for our company, of course, profit aim, about 50 million euro.
SPEAKER_00: So, we have to sell quite a lot of this things.
SPEAKER_00: We will try to get at the international market, so it will be, I think, mainly Europe and Northern America.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah, the seven men.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe some Asian countries.
SPEAKER_00: Also, important for all is the production cost.
SPEAKER_00: Maximum 12 euro.
SPEAKER_04: So, it's half of the selling price, if I am good in mathematics.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, we still have to make our profit.
SPEAKER_00: Of course.
SPEAKER_01: You all have to pay.
SPEAKER_01: Excuse me.
SPEAKER_01: We have to sell at least 4 million to make our own profit.
SPEAKER_04: Oh, yeah, very good in mathematics.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: 4 million.
SPEAKER_00: So, I think when we are working on the international market in principle, it has enough customers.
SPEAKER_00: So, when we have a good product, we could meet this aim, I think.
SPEAKER_00: So, that about the finance.
SPEAKER_00: And now, let's have some discussion about what is a good remote control.
SPEAKER_00: And, well, keep in mind this first point, it has to be original, it has to be trendy, it has to be user-friendly.
SPEAKER_00: Maybe some one can mention some additional rerequisites for a good remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Of course, it should have an honor, but...
SPEAKER_00: Yes, it should have the expected functionality of a remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: And it depends what application you are using it for.
SPEAKER_01: You might need...
SPEAKER_00: We are thinking television.
SPEAKER_01: We are targeting the television set, so you need to record channels.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You need to browse the channels in upwards.
SPEAKER_00: Yes, that's very handy.
SPEAKER_00: I always miss it and also remote controls that you can go channel up or down instead of re-typing the number, especially when you have to load channels.
SPEAKER_04: And just before starting the detailed discussion, maybe you are the marketing guy.
SPEAKER_04: I'm marketing.
SPEAKER_04: So, you are marketing and you are in user interface design.
SPEAKER_04: So, I just wanted to be sure.
SPEAKER_04: And I am the industrial designer.
SPEAKER_04: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: Because I don't know you very well actually.
SPEAKER_03: I am not too well.
SPEAKER_04: I'm happy to meet you.
SPEAKER_01: And I'm not.
SPEAKER_01: And I'm not.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not too.
SPEAKER_01: I think you know me.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_04: Just on your web page, but not face to face.
SPEAKER_04: So...
SPEAKER_00: So, some other very important things to do.
SPEAKER_00: Well, to specify in this first phase of the project, the browse function.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And you need the user once like changing the volume, changing the channel and then you, today we have teletext and all those things.
SPEAKER_01: Tomorrow you might have some more functions which might come to the...
SPEAKER_04: Like what?
SPEAKER_04: Like internet on the...
SPEAKER_01: You know we are looking for television things or IP.
SPEAKER_01: For example, personal video recorder and all those stuff are coming up.
SPEAKER_02: But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet.
SPEAKER_01: It's coming up actually.
SPEAKER_01: The personal video recorder and all those things.
SPEAKER_01: Well, I think...
SPEAKER_04: Actually, yes.
SPEAKER_00: You should, I think, think this over especially what functionality.
SPEAKER_04: Of course, and first, before designing the...
SPEAKER_04: Well, thinking about the functionalities, we need to know what are the user requirements.
SPEAKER_04: Then if they need internet, then we would be able to propose something with the TV over IP.
SPEAKER_04: But before...
SPEAKER_02: Ninety percent of the time, ninety-nine percent of the time people will be using the main functions, the volume, the different channels.
SPEAKER_02: So we can have all the fancy things as well.
SPEAKER_02: But the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use.
SPEAKER_00: Keep in mind, it's a 25 euro unit.
SPEAKER_00: So the very fancy stuff, we can leave it out, I think.
SPEAKER_00: So 25 euro, you expect a quite, well, normal, but good functioning user-friendly remote control.
SPEAKER_01: In that case, you always hook up with someone who is providing that and you know...
SPEAKER_01: You sell that product as well as your product with them.
SPEAKER_01: So try and get TV, many things.
SPEAKER_01: We're on to designing you one.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: No, it's okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I understand.
SPEAKER_01: So we need some numbering buttons, some teletext things.
SPEAKER_01: And then...
SPEAKER_04: The main is...
SPEAKER_00: About the buttons that will be on it.
SPEAKER_00: I think we can discuss that in the next meeting.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I would like to get this wrapped up and go to the end of this meeting.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, we are all ready.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So you know now the basic things.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And...
SPEAKER_00: Well, just for the next meeting...
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: You will work on eight designs.
SPEAKER_00: Keep it general.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, so we will be still flexible with maybe adding some functions.
SPEAKER_00: So...
SPEAKER_00: You will be working on technical function design.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, sure.
SPEAKER_00: And...
SPEAKER_00: When you...
SPEAKER_00: Well, think about requirements.
SPEAKER_00: Does it need internet?
SPEAKER_00: Or do we stay at...
SPEAKER_00: Basic...
SPEAKER_00: Basic television interface?
SPEAKER_00: So...
SPEAKER_00: I think we should now go work at this.
SPEAKER_00: And you will be informed to find email and kind of communication.
SPEAKER_00: Yep.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So the next meeting will be in 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_00: Keep in mind.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
None: Okay.
