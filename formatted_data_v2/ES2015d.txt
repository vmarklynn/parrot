SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: There you go.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
None: Sorry.
None: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_04: Why do we have two different microcos?
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: What would the difference be?
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: What would the difference be?
SPEAKER_01: Enter thing.
SPEAKER_01: I can't see why it was great.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Here you go.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: The agenda for the.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: The agenda for this meeting is, will initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers, and then we will evaluate it, given the criteria that we gave it, and talk about our finances, whether we were under or over our budget.
SPEAKER_01: I have a spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of what we've made, given our options, and evaluate the product as a group.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And so first we'll have the prototype presentation.
SPEAKER_01: Do you need the PowerPoint?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I'll just do a piece of that.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
None: Thank you.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Here we are.
SPEAKER_02: This is what we came up with.
SPEAKER_02: It's a pretty simple designer based on a mine go.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And we have the company logo here, and this will be the.
SPEAKER_02: Emperage.
SPEAKER_02: And just the part point.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Sorry.
SPEAKER_02: Where's the LED?
SPEAKER_02: It's in the middle of the middle of the art.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: And then the other one is this part.
SPEAKER_02: And we just have a sample design.
SPEAKER_02: And we wanted it all to be.
SPEAKER_02: Palm hell.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Palm hell.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: All the.
SPEAKER_02: What is our.
SPEAKER_02: No, see, I have a number 10 button.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, I thought we were going to take it.
SPEAKER_00: Right.
SPEAKER_04: No, it would be.
SPEAKER_02: I wrote.
SPEAKER_02: Just got one.
SPEAKER_02: Sorry.
SPEAKER_02: I was in charge of the number.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not.
SPEAKER_02: I'm just.
SPEAKER_00: So, one.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, press a plus button.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_01: I've never heard of that kind before.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, we just thought we have all the numbers here.
SPEAKER_02: So we wanted something.
SPEAKER_02: Represented numbers larger than.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, because if you on your average.
SPEAKER_00: If you press one twice, you just go to.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, I say you wanted channel 12.
SPEAKER_00: You press one and you go to channel one and then two.
SPEAKER_00: Then you just go to channel two instead of.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, there's not.
SPEAKER_00: So if you just like one plus two.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: You could go to two plus two is channel.
SPEAKER_01: Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two?
SPEAKER_02: No, no.
SPEAKER_02: I have all these numbers.
SPEAKER_02: These numbers all work and the pen race up to nine.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, but I mean if you press it, it'll go to that channel right away.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, because you got to press the plus afterwards.
SPEAKER_02: Oh no, the plus.
SPEAKER_02: I've here going past number nine.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I know, but if I want to go to say number like sixty five, channel sixty five, I press the six, it'll go to channel six and then I'll press the plus and then we'll go to six and then put the five and we'll go to sixty five.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: It doesn't.
SPEAKER_02: We haven't.
SPEAKER_02: I wouldn't thought you press the plus.
SPEAKER_02: No, I'm a six five, but she says.
SPEAKER_02: I don't want to.
SPEAKER_00: What do you think?
SPEAKER_00: Define that.
SPEAKER_00: I wouldn't have thought it would be a problem that it went to channel six.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, like on the way to channel.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it wouldn't be a problem.
SPEAKER_01: I was wondering like as long as we realize that's what it will do.
SPEAKER_03: There's a delay on remotes, I think, where you can have it.
SPEAKER_03: It's like a five second input time.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, and so as long as we hit them, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, yeah, that should be fine.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So it's not a big pause between the two buttons.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Um, was there, so on the top there is volume and channel, which channel I'm following.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, cool.
SPEAKER_00: You could just see and feel like that without thinking about it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we're, um, where's the power button?
SPEAKER_01: It's in the middle of the big air.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_00: So it's just like, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It's all accessible.
SPEAKER_02: We thought taking your hand off the remote.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And we went for like a circular design for the numbers because we thought that was kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, it could actually help with the repair of stress.
SPEAKER_02: It could cause another type of repression.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: But yeah, no, I mean, it's a different movement.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Um, and the feel of it.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, we've made this out of Plato, which is representing the, you know, the rubber.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: You know, the spongy, the rubberness.
SPEAKER_00: Um, because it was said before in the material specification that this, this anti RSI, um, materials often used in stress books.
SPEAKER_00: So this has got a, you know, a bit of give to it.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: The verstraspar field.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Feel it.
SPEAKER_01: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: How fit time you were.
SPEAKER_01: My goodness.
SPEAKER_01: There you go.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
SPEAKER_01: Ready?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, it's nice.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, I think I killed the fire.
SPEAKER_03: I did.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, God.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: As for the colors, we will presented with a limited range of colors for this prototype.
SPEAKER_00: But we're thinking that seeing as we're having an interchangeable casing anyway, that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colors that we would necessarily use or the combination.
SPEAKER_00: Um, and we're thinking to carry on with the fruit and vegetable theme, the color, um, combination just to be named after different fruit, like banana, with black and yellow water, and green, you know, vanilla might be the most popular if it's just a blending.
SPEAKER_00: It's kind of subtle and more settled cream.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It looks more a bit garish.
SPEAKER_01: I think like vanilla and banana would.
SPEAKER_00: But an is more representative of our color scheme, like the company, the yellow and the black.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_00: So that for corporate identity, that would probably be the most strange.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, watermelon, you know, probably appealing to the best.
SPEAKER_00: Kind of Christmas, you know.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Seasonal.
SPEAKER_00: Apple, green, brown, more kind of trendy, you know, kind of neat.
SPEAKER_02: The polygonics kind of yellow and funky kind of things.
SPEAKER_02: Cool.
SPEAKER_02: Then you can know it's more sophisticated cast around here.
SPEAKER_02: But that's almost all decor.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Um, yeah, we thought of the components.
SPEAKER_00: It was definitely a focus of ergonomics and just a single hand hand.
SPEAKER_00: Hand held device.
SPEAKER_00: And you don't need to use both hands.
SPEAKER_00: One hand to hold this and type in with the other.
SPEAKER_00: You can just use your thumb.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Um, as I said, the rubber is probably used for comfort and anti-hour size.
SPEAKER_00: That's about it.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you very much.
SPEAKER_01: Good work, everyone.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: And so now that we have, we have a prototype and we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches what our budget can handle.
SPEAKER_01: So I have something I'm going to.
SPEAKER_03: Wait, do you need to do a presentation first?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know what order it goes.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to check that out for a second.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah.
None: Sorry.
SPEAKER_01: You're right.
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to go over the evaluation criteria.
SPEAKER_02: Hello.
None: Hello.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Sorry.
SPEAKER_03: My computer is going to be technical difficulties.
SPEAKER_01: Just press the button again.
SPEAKER_01: I'll still do that.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And then again, I think.
None: One more time.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Now I think for this one, I could, would you guys prefer to use the whiteboard or maybe I'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it.
SPEAKER_03: We're going to be doing an evaluation report together based on the prototype that we've just seen.
SPEAKER_03: And looking, looking back at my notes from our, both our conceptual and our functional meetings, I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were back to our kickoff meeting this morning.
SPEAKER_03: And we'll evaluate as to whether we've done what we set up to do.
SPEAKER_03: And we're going to do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false.
SPEAKER_03: So basically the lower, lower the points, the better.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So question number one.
SPEAKER_03: Does the remote, whoops, sorry.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, I'm not going to, I'll do it on the whiteboard.
SPEAKER_03: I can't change it.
SPEAKER_03: So I'm going to ask you to push it down once.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: I'll write down our scores up on the, okay.
SPEAKER_03: So number one, do we have a fancy look and feel?
SPEAKER_04: Feel, I think.
SPEAKER_00: I think quite successful with the rubber, the look is a little bit more playful.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It depends on your definition of fancy, but it's definitely different.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, definitely.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think the color has a lot to do with it.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, the colors we were given for making the photos like the colors that I think we would have necessarily chosen is not the kind of tool.
SPEAKER_00: It's all red and black and yellow and orange.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry.
SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry.
SPEAKER_02: I don't want to go for black because most people are going to go for black and gray.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But if you can imagine that in like maybe kind of pale metallic finish or something.
SPEAKER_00: Well, I know it's for rubber.
SPEAKER_00: I can visualize this in nice colors.
SPEAKER_00: I think it would look great.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I kind of like the potato look.
SPEAKER_03: That's very cool.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, well.
SPEAKER_03: That's why I was bringing the vegetables.
SPEAKER_03: I'm sorry, the mango.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, the fruit or vegetable depends on your mood.
SPEAKER_01: So I myself would say a one or two.
SPEAKER_02: I would say two.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: One being true.
SPEAKER_00: I add two.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: That's this might get confusing.
SPEAKER_03: So question number two was is it technologically innovative?
SPEAKER_03: So I know we have the kinetic energy, which is very innovative.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And the use of the rubber.
SPEAKER_00: The use of the rubber.
SPEAKER_00: The use of the LED.
SPEAKER_00: The LED isn't used to take Killy innovative.
SPEAKER_00: And we don't have any scroll buttons.
SPEAKER_00: There's all push buttons.
SPEAKER_00: There's no LCD control.
SPEAKER_00: So if you're thinking about the rest of the market.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It's probably halfway in seven aspects.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Three.
SPEAKER_03: And I think it's tough to say because we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, we want it to be a purpose.
SPEAKER_03: So I mean, we'll put three, but I think we actually reached our goal.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We didn't want it any more than that.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Question number three will be easy to use.
SPEAKER_01: I think so.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I think it's, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Can't really get confused with that.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, we had to work out the number, the plus system.
SPEAKER_03: But once that's figured out, it's tough to turn it on.
SPEAKER_03: Number four, is this a good looking remote?
SPEAKER_03: Remember that 75% of users find most remote controls ugly.
SPEAKER_00: Again, I think the color comes into this.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Color will definitely be effective.
SPEAKER_01: I think that the logo could be smaller.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And maybe an odd, it's a prominent way.
SPEAKER_01: But maybe like at the bottom, kind of.
SPEAKER_02: The management said that it had to be taller than it.
SPEAKER_01: Whoops.
SPEAKER_01: It just had to be on there, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: Just not touch it.
SPEAKER_03: It's time for the three I killed.
SPEAKER_03: I was just wondering if it should be like flatter.
SPEAKER_01: I suppose I've got quite the appeal of it being like a big glob.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But you know what I've just thought of then, right?
SPEAKER_02: Where's the connie set in your living room?
SPEAKER_02: Maybe it's the bottom is just sort of flat.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, the bottom could be like chopped a bit.
SPEAKER_02: But then around.
SPEAKER_02: That is comfortable.
SPEAKER_02: That's true.
SPEAKER_01: It would still be comfortable.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe it could be on the bottom.
SPEAKER_03: So you wouldn't lose, like if it's flat here, so it sits up.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Like that.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, that was the last fall over all the time.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's less.
SPEAKER_03: If it's weighted, maybe.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, I would definitely go for that rather than like your average.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Like that.
SPEAKER_03: But definitely in another color, I'm not happy with that.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So it's a good looking remote.
SPEAKER_02: Do you want to show it off to our friends?
SPEAKER_01: You would though, because it's more interesting than all the other.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think it was another color and it was like, I think it would look okay.
None: Maybe you too.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, I mean, I would definitely go for that rather than like your average.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: We're like that.
SPEAKER_00: But definitely in another color.
SPEAKER_00: I'm not happy with that.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So should we say to?
SPEAKER_03: For that?
SPEAKER_03: Sure.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Question number five was, will people be willing to spend 25 euros on this product?
SPEAKER_03: Remember that 80% of users were willing to spend more money when remote control looked fancy?
SPEAKER_02: I think we have to market it in the right way.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: To say that is really simple.
SPEAKER_02: So people didn't just say it and think this is so simple.
SPEAKER_02: I do want to spend 25 euros.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: The marketing of lots of units.
SPEAKER_00: The kinetic energy she kissed early.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, no.
SPEAKER_00: She kicked her butt.
SPEAKER_00: She kicked her butt.
SPEAKER_00: The video.
SPEAKER_00: There's a beef video.
SPEAKER_02: I don't know what the plot is.
SPEAKER_03: No, I guess I don't know much about the remote control industry.
SPEAKER_03: How much your average sells for.
SPEAKER_03: But you're a marketing expert.
SPEAKER_03: I know I am right here.
SPEAKER_02: I think they're quite tan.
SPEAKER_02: I think they're tan.
SPEAKER_02: I think they're tan.
SPEAKER_02: I think they're tan.
SPEAKER_02: But you don't have to buy batteries.
SPEAKER_03: So in the long term, this can actually save you money.
SPEAKER_01: So we'll market it that way.
SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So yeah, I think with the good marketing scheme and the personalization options.
SPEAKER_03: So yeah, I would give it a two.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Number six.
SPEAKER_03: Can someone read it out?
SPEAKER_00: Does this product type match the operating behavior of the output?
SPEAKER_00: She's there.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So that was mainly the.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think it does.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the channel changing.
SPEAKER_00: And it's just you won't have to think about it.
SPEAKER_00: You don't have to look down to find them.
SPEAKER_00: They're clearly there.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I guess the key word there is average because there were some people that use the video input and sound and stuff.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But they're not you and I really.
SPEAKER_03: So okay.
SPEAKER_03: So one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Number seven.
SPEAKER_03: Heather, can you push it down?
SPEAKER_03: Well, this remote control be easy to find when lost.
SPEAKER_03: Remember that 50% of users lose their remote regularly.
SPEAKER_03: We had the alarm system.
SPEAKER_03: Is the alarm system still?
SPEAKER_02: Was it implemented?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: When you press the alarm system, the light.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: The light's on the end or flash the bulb.
SPEAKER_00: I mean, it's not obviously obvious from outside that's going to happen.
SPEAKER_00: Because you can't particularly see the alarm.
SPEAKER_00: I have the light on the inside.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: The light it will.
SPEAKER_02: Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But when the alarm is not.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: If you must button makes a noise, right?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It turns into a duck and starts cracking.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: You're right.
SPEAKER_00: Awesome.
SPEAKER_00: I think if it was had an alarm system, I mean, when it like suffered, I mean, it could light up when the alarm went.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: If it was hidden underneath the question or something, it wouldn't be any point.
SPEAKER_00: So you can't see the alarm, but it would like.
SPEAKER_01: I thought it was going to make a noise.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: You can't see an alarm inside the alarm system itself.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: You just explained why it's not on the prototype.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It'll be there.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_03: Sorry.
SPEAKER_03: We could give it a one because compared to every other remote ever made, this one will be easier to find.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Sorry, Heather.
SPEAKER_03: No problem.
SPEAKER_03: Question number eight.
SPEAKER_03: Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new?
SPEAKER_03: Remember that 34% of users usually found it difficult.
SPEAKER_03: Totally.
SPEAKER_03: It has to be.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's not the one to do.
SPEAKER_02: The plus thing is we walked on.
SPEAKER_02: What's that written on the page?
SPEAKER_02: That.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think just because it's, we've decided to reduce it down for the basic buttons.
SPEAKER_00: I think that in itself makes it.
SPEAKER_03: Does it make more sense for the middle one to be just an enter button?
SPEAKER_03: So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So it's just like channel six.
SPEAKER_01: That kind of noise.
SPEAKER_01: And then zero sexy.
SPEAKER_02: That's the first.
SPEAKER_02: We don't have to press zero.
SPEAKER_02: You could just press six.
SPEAKER_03: Enter.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay.
SPEAKER_00: I know.
SPEAKER_00: One, two, three, four, five.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think that's probably the most straightforward.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Good.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So we can.
SPEAKER_03: We'll say yes.
SPEAKER_03: It's one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Question number nine.
SPEAKER_03: Well, minimize the effects of RSI, which was repeated strain injury.
SPEAKER_03: Which affected over a quarter of users.
SPEAKER_01: I think so.
SPEAKER_01: But if your thumb might get a little.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I don't think it will.
SPEAKER_00: We may have to do some more research in the other strain injuries that we don't know about.
SPEAKER_01: But it is soft.
SPEAKER_01: And that's kind of what the.
SPEAKER_01: And people PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what other option we get.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, you can hold your left hand and.
SPEAKER_03: Use your index figure.
SPEAKER_03: But there's not really any other options.
SPEAKER_03: It's like a keyboard.
SPEAKER_03: So I think we did as much as you can with remote control.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So one or two, do you think?
SPEAKER_00: I think.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Two.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Number 10.
SPEAKER_03: Did we somehow incorporate the company color and logo?
SPEAKER_03: Yes.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: Is the color going to be there even if it's like vanilla is the yellow.
SPEAKER_02: We can't really do that.
SPEAKER_02: For example, on the banana thing, we can't have everything yellow.
SPEAKER_02: It will sound like.
SPEAKER_02: So it's not always going to be the same color.
SPEAKER_03: It sounds like the color is something that we.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The colors are yellow and gray.
SPEAKER_01: Gray.
SPEAKER_02: So it could be gray on the banana one.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Could be gray.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, the yellow, yeah, the yellow is ugly though, depending on that.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers and see if we can get away with just the R.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And this is the.
SPEAKER_00: The fact that we need to be successful.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Perhaps.
SPEAKER_00: That's great.
SPEAKER_02: And then the buttons in the middle.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So do you think that's more of a three then?
SPEAKER_03: Four.
SPEAKER_03: Four.
SPEAKER_03: I think four.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I don't.
SPEAKER_03: Well, we have good reasons for it.
SPEAKER_03: So we can still put a.
SPEAKER_03: Four.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And final question.
SPEAKER_03: Do we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics?
SPEAKER_03: Current trends of fruits and veggies desire for sponginess.
SPEAKER_01: I would say so.
SPEAKER_01: But maybe more like two because there's no like pictures of fruit.
SPEAKER_01: It's just sort of naming it by a fruit.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So you can have banana and kiwi and.

SPEAKER_01: But you know I can't.
SPEAKER_01: Or is it locked?

SPEAKER_00: Have you, have you completed it?
SPEAKER_00: No.
SPEAKER_01: No, I was hoping that you guys could.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: There we go.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So we need to tally up how much our product will be costing.
SPEAKER_01: So you can look up at the screen.
SPEAKER_01: The live screen.
SPEAKER_01: I guess looking at your own too and telling you which one you think.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: We're using kinetic, which is quite.
SPEAKER_01: A large expense of three euros.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: We're using a regular chip.
SPEAKER_01: Yep.

SPEAKER_01: Well, one color for the case, one color for the buttons.
SPEAKER_01: So we can.
SPEAKER_01: We have push button interface.
SPEAKER_01: That's inexpensive.
SPEAKER_01: And you have a special color for the button.
SPEAKER_01: And we also have a special form.
SPEAKER_01: And special material.
SPEAKER_01: Which puts us just barely under budget.
SPEAKER_00: Hey, congratulations.

SPEAKER_01: And back to our PowerPoint.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yes, we are.
SPEAKER_01: So we need to do a project evaluation.
SPEAKER_01: Again, which is probably, um.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: A different extension of the.
SPEAKER_00: Of the actual project rather than the project.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: A project.

SPEAKER_00: For creativity.
SPEAKER_00: We went.
SPEAKER_00: Really given.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: To go about.
SPEAKER_00: So I think we could have done it a bit more.

None: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So it'd be like.
SPEAKER_01: But you were allowed.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And the conceptual and functional.
SPEAKER_03: Like we were very creative and coming up with an idea.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: What we just limited by resources.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: If we had decided to use the L.T.
SPEAKER_00: E screen and like solar power backup and everything.
SPEAKER_00: And we would have been able to afford that.
SPEAKER_00: So that did.
SPEAKER_00: Great.

SPEAKER_00: I'm also a personal coach.
SPEAKER_00: Helps along the way.
SPEAKER_03: And the timing was good.
SPEAKER_03: We never were pushed for time or sat around doing nothing.

SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
None: All right.
None: How are our means?
SPEAKER_01: We needed more Play-Doh colors.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And more Play-Doh because that was all the red we had.
SPEAKER_00: So if we wanted to make a bigger.
SPEAKER_00: Oh really?
SPEAKER_00: We wouldn't have been able to.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think we could.
SPEAKER_01: I don't think anything else was satisfactory.
SPEAKER_01: Is that?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: The computer programs are good.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It could be really straightforward.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I think the only thing was having to remember to, you know, take the okay.
