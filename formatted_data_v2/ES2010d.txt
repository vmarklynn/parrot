SPEAKER_02: I want to find out if our work works.
SPEAKER_02: Me too.
SPEAKER_02: Oh.
SPEAKER_02: So I...
SPEAKER_01: What do you think?
SPEAKER_01: Here's the agenda for our last meeting.
SPEAKER_01: After the opening, we're going to have a prototype presentation.
SPEAKER_01: Then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote.
SPEAKER_01: Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process.
SPEAKER_01: And then we're going to close it up and we have 40 minutes.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: Sorry.
SPEAKER_01: Oh.
None: Nope.
SPEAKER_01: Let's have a prototype presentation.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Ready?
SPEAKER_03: Sure.
SPEAKER_03: You are me.
SPEAKER_03: Yee.
SPEAKER_00: You read that stuff since you wrote it.
SPEAKER_03: Well, since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for.
SPEAKER_03: I'm just going to translate what this all means for you.
SPEAKER_03: The base is going to be gunmetal-glory, which is what we decided.
SPEAKER_03: It's going to be plastic.
SPEAKER_03: Then there's the latex cover, which is what you see as red.
SPEAKER_03: Because it can be replaceable, we just kind of went with the color.
SPEAKER_03: Right.
SPEAKER_03: And then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top.
SPEAKER_03: And the buttons will be much lighter blue.
SPEAKER_03: Almost see-through.
SPEAKER_03: And the whole thing lights up, you should press any button rather than just that one button or a light up.
SPEAKER_03: And then at the bottom we have our logo.
SPEAKER_03: Bright yellow is sort of designed with the RR, which will actually look like our logo.
SPEAKER_03: And then on the side you have the buttons.
SPEAKER_03: And they're one button, but they kind of push up and down.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: And then they're screwing.
SPEAKER_00: Nope.
SPEAKER_03: They're just buttons, right?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And then the buttons.
SPEAKER_00: On-off switch will be here.
SPEAKER_00: And as you've noticed on our prototype, they've ended up with a curvature kind of biconcave sort of thing, because I can't see underneath.
SPEAKER_00: So I'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that, because they're very nice to stock.
SPEAKER_00: Stick your fingering.
SPEAKER_00: The two squared buttons are to probably least used menu, mute.
SPEAKER_00: And then these are the numbers.
SPEAKER_00: So our channel and our volume will be on either side.
SPEAKER_03: And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labeling on top.
SPEAKER_03: Just...
SPEAKER_01: And did you determine the curvature of the bottom part of it, or the hand is going to be a single or a double?
SPEAKER_01: It's a single, single, single, single, single, because it's not big enough to really constitute
SPEAKER_00: a double. It's only actually the size of my hand.
SPEAKER_01: Great.
SPEAKER_01: I think you did an awesome job.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think it's beautiful.
SPEAKER_01: It is beautiful.
SPEAKER_01: And it's everything that we discussed.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Good job, you guys.
SPEAKER_01: Good job.
SPEAKER_01: That was really good.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: What's next in our agenda?
SPEAKER_01: We're going to discuss the evaluation criteria, and that's with Courtney.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: It's PowerPoint presentation.
SPEAKER_02: I don't really know exactly what we should talk about.
SPEAKER_02: It's under evaluation.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: So these are the criteria we're going to ask.
SPEAKER_02: Is it easy to use?
SPEAKER_02: Is it fashionable?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I guess we should write these down.
SPEAKER_02: We should reference them.
SPEAKER_03: Feel good meaning or?
SPEAKER_02: Like, does it feel good?
SPEAKER_02: Physically.
None: Yeah, physically.
SPEAKER_02: That's just for current trends.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: It doesn't really count, you guys.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, it's a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But so we do have removable covers, right?
SPEAKER_02: Yes.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, well then that's correct.
SPEAKER_02: And so we can, everybody have that?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, wait.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, she's got it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, so we're using the criteria for some point scale.
SPEAKER_02: And so we need to discuss how we feel it falls within this range.
SPEAKER_02: So for easy to use.
SPEAKER_02: Do we feel it's very easy to use?
SPEAKER_02: Are we going to?
SPEAKER_01: I say we individually, right?
SPEAKER_01: What do you guys just really?
SPEAKER_01: Why not?
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Easy to use.
SPEAKER_01: I vote six.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, wait.
SPEAKER_00: That's false.
SPEAKER_00: Two.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: I'd say two as well.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, two.
SPEAKER_02: Two.
SPEAKER_02: That's what I say.
SPEAKER_02: Hello.
SPEAKER_02: We're great.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Fashionable.
SPEAKER_02: At the moment?
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_02: No, I mean like no.
SPEAKER_02: I think it's very fashionable.
SPEAKER_02: Very chic.
SPEAKER_02: I would give it a one.
SPEAKER_00: One.
SPEAKER_00: I'll give it a two because at the moment it's not looking that way.
SPEAKER_02: Well, that's just like a prototype.
SPEAKER_02: That's a clay.
SPEAKER_03: It's a prototype.
SPEAKER_03: What do you think?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know if that's a life.
SPEAKER_03: Give it like three or four.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So the average is about a two.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Two.
SPEAKER_02: Two points.
SPEAKER_02: That's okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: All the customers we have.
SPEAKER_01: Does it feel good?
SPEAKER_01: Imagine.
SPEAKER_01: Since we obviously don't have that.
SPEAKER_00: I feel like the shape of it actually does.
SPEAKER_01: And it's it is very ergonomically designed.
SPEAKER_01: It's going to be curved.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's going to be thicker.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I think it feels good.
SPEAKER_02: I think so too.
SPEAKER_02: I'll give it a two.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Two.
SPEAKER_01: I'll give it a one.
None: What do you say?
SPEAKER_00: I'd say two.
SPEAKER_00: I can average just two.
SPEAKER_01: Is it technologically innovative?
SPEAKER_01: I'm sorry, I'm taking over your job.
SPEAKER_01: Oh no, it's fine.
SPEAKER_01: You're writing it.
SPEAKER_01: You're a project manager.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, does it have voice?
SPEAKER_02: I mean, the phrase recognition on it?
None: Yes.
None: Right.
SPEAKER_01: We were able to do it with that kind of chip.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, right.
SPEAKER_00: We could do it with the chip.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_00: It wasn't.
SPEAKER_00: We had no reflection of it.
SPEAKER_00: There's no reflection of it on the prototype.
SPEAKER_00: Right.
SPEAKER_00: That's because it's way too dimension.
SPEAKER_01: And we discussed that.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: So then yes, then I would, well, it doesn't, what else would it need to be technologically innovative?
SPEAKER_01: Well, we don't have the, you know, we can't say channel.
SPEAKER_01: It changes the channel.
SPEAKER_02: And it doesn't cover anything other than TV.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: So I'd probably give it a three.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Even though it is for just a TV remote, it's very advanced.
SPEAKER_02: But it is just a TV remote.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I'd go for a three or four on that one.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Let's go for a three point five.
SPEAKER_01: Three and a half.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: And the last criteria, is it, is it.
SPEAKER_01: Squishy and fruity.
SPEAKER_01: Well, we've covered that with these.
SPEAKER_01: We'll try and do you base it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So I'd give it a two.
SPEAKER_00: It's capable of being.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, very, very beautiful.
SPEAKER_02: Squishy and fruity.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And it's very important.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Next.
SPEAKER_02: So, our model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be winner.
SPEAKER_02: And hopefully we'll sell millions.
SPEAKER_02: Good job team.
SPEAKER_00: How did you get that in there?
SPEAKER_00: What?
SPEAKER_00: Slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie.
SPEAKER_00: It does.
SPEAKER_01: It was good.
SPEAKER_01: Thanks.
SPEAKER_01: Very good.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Let's go back to this.
None: No.
SPEAKER_01: That's it.
SPEAKER_01: Oops.
None: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So now we're moving on to finance.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I'm going to show you an Excel spreadsheet.
SPEAKER_01: And we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under 1250 euro.
SPEAKER_01: If so, we can proceed.
SPEAKER_01: If not, we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Let me bring that up.
SPEAKER_01: Here we go.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: It's not a hand on.
SPEAKER_01: It's powered by battery.
SPEAKER_01: Yep.
SPEAKER_01: So we give it a two number of components you plan to use.
SPEAKER_01: Did I just put quantity being one battery or?
SPEAKER_01: Do you want to go for this is where we need to make the final call.
SPEAKER_01: If it's a lithium or you want to go triple A's because triple A's we're going to have to do more than one battery.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, let's just go for it.
SPEAKER_01: Lithium.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Let's do a lithium.
SPEAKER_01: I think we're going to be able to purchase this are going to be technologically advanced.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Down to the electronics section.
SPEAKER_01: We're going to need this kind.
SPEAKER_01: Correct.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Voice sensor.
SPEAKER_01: So one of those.
SPEAKER_01: It is a single curve.
SPEAKER_01: So one of those.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, what's that?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's correct.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Down here.
SPEAKER_00: Voice material.
SPEAKER_01: Plastic.
SPEAKER_01: And special color.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Down here.
SPEAKER_01: Interface type.
SPEAKER_01: We're going to have the integrated scroll.
SPEAKER_01: Scroll.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, those are just regular.
SPEAKER_00: But it's a push button too.
SPEAKER_00: Right there.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So integrated scroll wheel or push button.
SPEAKER_00: We're really having just push button interface.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So we can just go.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: But will we.
SPEAKER_02: Actually, we'll need to won't we one for the top and then one for this one for each side.
SPEAKER_00: But that just covers the type of button we're having.
SPEAKER_00: Because we're not doing a scroll on the side.
SPEAKER_00: So push button.
SPEAKER_03: I think that 29 means like you have both scrolls and push button.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put like here.
SPEAKER_02: Because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not going to be on the same plane when you press the button.
SPEAKER_02: You have to be additional signals on the side.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: So is that going to be an extra one on each side?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: That might put us well.
SPEAKER_01: Let's just.
SPEAKER_03: Two or three because of one each side and one on top.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, it's fine.
SPEAKER_02: It comes out the same as 29.
SPEAKER_02: We'll less than 29.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: And we're going to button supplements.
SPEAKER_01: The buttons are not their special color.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: They're special form.
SPEAKER_02: They're indented.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_02: And there's special material.
SPEAKER_01: Well, we're under costs then.
SPEAKER_01: Over.
SPEAKER_01: Over.
SPEAKER_01: 12.5 is our limit.
SPEAKER_01: Got 11.2.
SPEAKER_00: So we can go to production.
SPEAKER_00: We can go to.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know what I just did.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Now we're going to talk about the project process and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result.
SPEAKER_01: Did we have a lot of room for creativity?
SPEAKER_01: Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership?
SPEAKER_01: Teamwork and the means, meaning technology that we use to produce our little guy there?
SPEAKER_01: And if we found a new ideas.
SPEAKER_01: Now, the question is how do we do this?
None: Go back.
SPEAKER_02: I think we just discussed it.
SPEAKER_01: Discuss, sure.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Who would like to go first?
SPEAKER_00: I think we got stifled for creativity by the company itself.
SPEAKER_00: In restricting assembly to using a TV remote.
SPEAKER_00: Initially.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, that's true.
SPEAKER_03: And no internet.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: No, yeah, that's a good point.
SPEAKER_02: Because I've forgotten that that was an art decision.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And how did you feel about the whole process though?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, overall, I mean, I thought we did a good job.
SPEAKER_02: Like, we got to choose basically a control over minus of being just merely a TV remote.
SPEAKER_02: We got to choose what we wanted to do with it.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: And we got to say over how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable.
SPEAKER_01: Which I kind of am more fashionable for like technology.
SPEAKER_01: Yep.
SPEAKER_01: That's right.
SPEAKER_01: What about the teamwork aspect?
SPEAKER_01: How did you guys enjoy making the model the prototype?
SPEAKER_01: I think we did well.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I think you did.
SPEAKER_01: Did you work well together in there?
SPEAKER_01: Well, no, there was someone fighting.
SPEAKER_00: They were scratching it.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, my.
SPEAKER_01: And we've all been a pretty congenial team here.
SPEAKER_01: I think we have many many.
SPEAKER_02: I mean, I'm fine with you guys being like, what is it?
SPEAKER_02: The survey annoying or irritating?
SPEAKER_02: Wow, that's a definitely a strong one.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: The means the whiteboard didn't work.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I'll go into that.
SPEAKER_01: Have to knock that one down.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, no, I'll just.
SPEAKER_00: And her friend here really feels strongly about the internet.
SPEAKER_00: And they're so much available.
SPEAKER_02: The digital panels.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Digital panels.
SPEAKER_01: They were really fine.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: They're fun.
SPEAKER_02: You know, I'm not really sure what I could do with them, but they are awesome.
SPEAKER_00: These are the laptops for receiving everything.
SPEAKER_00: Right.
SPEAKER_00: Wireless too.
SPEAKER_00: Wireless.
SPEAKER_01: And that we have a shared network where we can put all of them.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And let's not forget sexy dual microphones.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And big brother.
SPEAKER_01: Big brother.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Have we found any new ideas through this process?
SPEAKER_02: We are really going to sell this.
SPEAKER_01: For something that looks cool and also has what I want it to do technologically.
SPEAKER_01: And that's your right brain taking over wanting the artistic, the fashionable, the hip.
SPEAKER_01: You know, if we all just went out and bought useful things, I don't think.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, that's why I don't like a Max or apples, just because I look at it.
SPEAKER_03: I know it's probably a very good computer, but I look at it and I'm taking back to elementary school because they look the same.
SPEAKER_03: They look like they did when I was in elementary school.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, because they're pretty and just like the term of district school would only use his Max with their kids exactly.
SPEAKER_03: So I associate them with like really low tech, really cheap back font.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But I do like I pods go for you.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: No, I pods.
SPEAKER_00: They want all those words for you.
SPEAKER_00: I pods are now quite trendy and they come in different colors.
SPEAKER_01: Exactly.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, how many people went out and bought a Nokia phone back when we were like in high school, just they could get the changeable faceplates.
SPEAKER_01: Oh, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Everybody.
SPEAKER_01: Anyway, so that.
SPEAKER_03: I didn't have a phone until you got one issue.
SPEAKER_03: It's just like the whole it's for TV only.
SPEAKER_03: I was like, who's going to buy a remote just for the TV unless they've lost theirs.
SPEAKER_02: Look at it.
SPEAKER_02: That is a fashionable sheet.
SPEAKER_01: People.
SPEAKER_02: Whoa.
SPEAKER_02: Working director says, yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Special people.
SPEAKER_03: Working has to actually create the desire for it.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, I will.
SPEAKER_03: That's okay.
SPEAKER_00: We can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met.
SPEAKER_00: This will help them find the one.
SPEAKER_00: They'll be sexy with it.
SPEAKER_02: We have a type of commercial and that's the fig leaf.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: That'll sell.
SPEAKER_00: And so the serpent says use our remote.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: No.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: We're going to wrap this up now.
SPEAKER_01: The costs are within the budget.
SPEAKER_01: We evaluated the project and now we're going to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary and then we're going to have a big giant party parent like four to this.
SPEAKER_01: So.
SPEAKER_01: Great.
SPEAKER_01: Thank you, team.
SPEAKER_00: Great job.
SPEAKER_01: It was lovely working with you.
SPEAKER_00: You too.
SPEAKER_00: Yay.
SPEAKER_00: Thanks to the project leader.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
None: We knew.
