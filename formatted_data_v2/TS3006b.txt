None: it's not even cheap greenhouse Editor for that reason.
None: No.
None: Ah yeaahahah.
None:!
SPEAKER_02: I didn't see it yet I think.
SPEAKER_00: Did I miss something?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, pretty much.
SPEAKER_02: I thought I'd come and mail you so I thought I'd just drop it in.
SPEAKER_03: Hey, what's wrong with my computer?
None: It's an iconita who is telling you.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, that's my presentation.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, right.
SPEAKER_03: Hey, everybody ready?
SPEAKER_03: Sorry, I'm not a good player.
SPEAKER_03: Okay, where do I find this?
SPEAKER_00: I'm not a good player.
SPEAKER_00: And then, I'm a paradise.
SPEAKER_01: You read the new flash?
SPEAKER_02: No, what was it?
SPEAKER_02: Oh, no, press it.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, no, but my screen is reduced in size.
SPEAKER_02: What?
SPEAKER_03: Feedback?
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I'll delete.
SPEAKER_01: Let's see.
SPEAKER_01: So it doesn't draw the attention away.
SPEAKER_00: I made my own map.
SPEAKER_03: No, not this, but the task.
SPEAKER_03: No, I just flipped it, close it, took it here and then this happened.
SPEAKER_03: And that's not the way it's.
SPEAKER_03: Where was it?
SPEAKER_03: It's settings.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, all right.
SPEAKER_03: Thank you.
SPEAKER_03: Do you guys like your task?
SPEAKER_03: I get my function, you know, the information that I need.
SPEAKER_01: So frustrating.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I don't like the end and just typing it to that.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, I have to do that.
SPEAKER_03: So, this presentation is mainly based on my own ideas because I hadn't time to integrate the information yet.
SPEAKER_02: Really annoying.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_02: I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So, I'm going to talk about functional requirements.
SPEAKER_01: Well, some research has been done, has been done, observing of 100 subjects and usability lab using the remote control.
SPEAKER_01: They also fill in a questionnaire.
SPEAKER_01: The findings were, well, you can see them for yourself.
SPEAKER_01: They dislike to look at field current remote controls.
SPEAKER_01: They're ugly.
SPEAKER_01: They do not match the operating behavior of the user, so they don't match what they want to have on it.
SPEAKER_01: They're often lost somewhere in the room.
SPEAKER_01: It takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control.
SPEAKER_01: And they're bad for error's eye.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know how a user can read that, but okay.
SPEAKER_01: There was also research on the most relevant and irrelevant functions.
SPEAKER_01: Most irrelevant and less used were audio settings, mono stereo, pitch, bass, screen settings for brightness and color and stuff like that.
SPEAKER_01: But they are used.
SPEAKER_01: They do need to be under remote control.
SPEAKER_01: And if you can't control the sound settings, I mean, if you dislike a very loud bass or something, you need to change that.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we have to.
SPEAKER_01: If he doesn't have an equalizer.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, we can't, my TV has, but we can leave them away.
SPEAKER_01: Most relevant and most used functions, they speak for themselves, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: Power button, channel volume selection, daily text, but we can skip that because I saw the new slash and daily text is so outdated that it should not be used anymore in the future.
SPEAKER_01: So forget this one and channel settings.
SPEAKER_01: So for programming your channels in the right order.
SPEAKER_03: Where did you guys get that new slash?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I didn't get anything.
SPEAKER_01: On the project.
SPEAKER_02: Not by mail.
SPEAKER_02: I received mail, but you don't.
SPEAKER_01: No, so it's a text file in the project folder.
SPEAKER_01: So daily text can be skipped.
SPEAKER_02: That's in the presentation.
SPEAKER_01: There was some research on new features in the remote control about an LCD screen and speech recognition.
SPEAKER_01: Well, we got an update for the audience or the targeted group.
SPEAKER_01: So it's above 40, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: The new product or below.
SPEAKER_01: Because that's pretty relevant.
SPEAKER_01: I thought our ads.
SPEAKER_02: Our current customers are in the age group 40 plus.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And the new product should reach new markets.
SPEAKER_02: Below.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, well.
SPEAKER_01: That's in the new.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, that's good to know.
SPEAKER_01: Because you see a clear distinction between the age groups concerning the features.
SPEAKER_01: And above 40 people are not so interested in the screen or speech recognition.
SPEAKER_01: But below that age they pretty much are.
SPEAKER_01: So I think we can build that in.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, well, we can skip this part as well because I thought our ad above 40.
SPEAKER_01: So we could skip the features, but we just have to build them in because they find it very interesting.
SPEAKER_01: Well, we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user friendly as possible.
SPEAKER_01: And also, so not only the design of the buttons but how you can push them and stuff like that.
SPEAKER_01: So the physical aspect of it.
SPEAKER_01: And I think certainly for the lower age groups, a nice design.
SPEAKER_01: Which does not make the remote control or no to stay in your room.
SPEAKER_01: It's actually a part of your interior of your design in your room.
SPEAKER_01: So the people can say, whoa, what's that?
SPEAKER_01: Well, that's my remote control.
SPEAKER_01: So it has to look nice and feel nice and have all the functions.
SPEAKER_02: But it also needs to have corporate identity.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So the logo has to be present and the colors as well.
SPEAKER_02: We can change much of that.
SPEAKER_01: Two years.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But I don't think that's a problem because the thing has to have a color anyway.
SPEAKER_01: And most of the time there is a brand present on it.
SPEAKER_01: So I think that's not going to affect it very much.
SPEAKER_01: But that are the consequences of the marketing part.
SPEAKER_02: It's open already so you can use all top.
SPEAKER_00: Oh, you're here.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, no.
SPEAKER_00: You pressed all the four?
SPEAKER_00: No, no, no.
SPEAKER_00: I pressed the mouse button.
SPEAKER_03: Oh, great.
SPEAKER_03: That's a self-destruct button.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe you can do it from your computer.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And if you go stand around here.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Sure.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_02: That's nice.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_00: I had two examples.
SPEAKER_00: This one is the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons.
SPEAKER_00: This is the easy one.
SPEAKER_00: I think we have to combine them.
SPEAKER_00: And yeah, merge the best functions of all examples.
SPEAKER_00: But yeah, the H is under 40.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And marketing research stated that that kind of users are not afraid of a lot of functions.
SPEAKER_00: So not too much.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We do have to integrate the screen and the speech recognition.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: All right.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: This one we can remove for kids.
SPEAKER_00: It's just only for adults.
SPEAKER_00: So we can use some advanced options.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: From age of 16.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But I prefer we use the basic options.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: We have to make them very easy.
SPEAKER_00: So for just zipping around channels, you can just push one button.
SPEAKER_00: But if you want to use your video recorder or something else, you should use an advanced option.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But the news flash also stated that it should control only one device.
SPEAKER_01: So only your television.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: So it's very easy.
SPEAKER_01: Now, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: So there are not extra options in this case.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Also, yeah.
SPEAKER_00: We have to make it fashionable.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
None: You want to set it before.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: The basic functions.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Only use the extra functions if they are really needed.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So maybe you can hide them or something.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Well, what we can do with the screen is all the configuration options.
SPEAKER_01: You can put that in the screen.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Screen menu to do that.
SPEAKER_01: And then the basic function just under defies itself.
SPEAKER_01: So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen with a clear menu.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Uh, functionality is the screen.
SPEAKER_02: What does the screen do?
SPEAKER_02: All right.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_02: It's low on power.
SPEAKER_02: What are they?
SPEAKER_01: So what does the screen do?
SPEAKER_02: They said they needed it.
SPEAKER_02: What does it do?
SPEAKER_02: What do they want?
SPEAKER_00: For the advanced functions, I think.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Well, it didn't say what they want to do with the screen.
SPEAKER_01: My guess is pretty handy for advanced functions.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: Searching for channels.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Searching for channels.
SPEAKER_01: Programming them.
SPEAKER_00: Nevermind.
SPEAKER_00: I'm almost finished.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: We have to watch out for the, if we make it very fashionable, the functionality will go down.
SPEAKER_00: So we have to make a compromise between functionality and fashion.
SPEAKER_00: Complement them for them.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: That was the end.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Well, my presentation is a bit sucky.
SPEAKER_03: Well, you can improvise, right?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, a little bit.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_02: Do you think there are requirements?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, I think that will be it.
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_01: So we can go for it.
SPEAKER_03: That was, you know, you know.
SPEAKER_03: Let me check.
SPEAKER_02: It's not really English.
SPEAKER_03: I know.
SPEAKER_02: The kickoff.
SPEAKER_02: Our working design.
SPEAKER_02: We got it.
SPEAKER_01: So we can go for the look and feel of the left example and then a screen on top of it.
SPEAKER_02: Here you go.
SPEAKER_03: All right.
SPEAKER_03: How do I skip pages?
SPEAKER_02: Just press the keys.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: All right.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Well, I was working on this before I got my information.
SPEAKER_03: So I was just working off the top of my head using my common knowledge about remote controls and, well, the info on the website, which came to it.
SPEAKER_03: So I didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet.
SPEAKER_03: This is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last meeting.
SPEAKER_03: Those were my starting points.
SPEAKER_03: I was working on a, yeah, on a schedule and I was supposed to do it like this, but, yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Then the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow.
SPEAKER_03: So I was trying to organize them for myself and then make the design, the design, the actual design, but I never came around to do that.
SPEAKER_03: So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about it.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, everything speaks for itself, I guess.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, you press a button, it sends a signal to a chip, which translates it into infrared signal of certain spatial frequency.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, frequency.
SPEAKER_03: And our temporal frequencies, actually, and then through a transformer, the signal gets boosted and then sent to the receiver on the TV to feel translated into the function.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, well, this was actually all I got around to do.
SPEAKER_03: I mean, I don't know if I'm too slow for this stuff, but then work harder.
SPEAKER_00: Should we make a list of all the functions we want to...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we want to incorporate into it.
SPEAKER_02: Okay, for those that didn't see yet, the basic new requirements of the management were no-time text, only for TV.
SPEAKER_02: It should be designed for a user group below 40, but I don't think it's wrong if we can target the current customer group as well.
SPEAKER_02: And the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control.
SPEAKER_02: And we have to decide on the functions and on the...
SPEAKER_02: Let's see, what was it?
SPEAKER_02: The target group.
SPEAKER_02: We have to make me clear what that is.
SPEAKER_01: The target group of users?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it uses.
SPEAKER_01: Because it says below 40, I mean...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I think it's easy, but...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, or male and female.
SPEAKER_01: Or in just...
SPEAKER_01: No, it's below 40.
SPEAKER_01: The marketing research started on the age of 16, 16 to 25, 25 to 35, 35 to 45, something like that.
SPEAKER_02: So below 40 is okay, but we need an lower level in which to...
SPEAKER_02: How do you miss?
SPEAKER_02: So is it from 16 to 40?
SPEAKER_02: Is it from 20 to 40?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's from 16 to 40.
SPEAKER_01: I guess people of 16 are quite used to technology.
SPEAKER_01: So they adapted pretty soon, I guess.
SPEAKER_00: If we have a larger public, we have more options to sell our product.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, so what we might want to do is...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, have customized the screen functions, if you know what I mean.
SPEAKER_03: Younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines, they can use more advanced functions, but maybe elderly people don't understand it so well.
SPEAKER_03: So they need a simpler remote.
SPEAKER_03: And that you can choose what the design displays or whatever.
SPEAKER_00: That's right, I wanted to make two different groups of functions.
SPEAKER_00: The simple functions for the whole public and the advanced options for the younger people who are more experienced.
SPEAKER_01: But they all incorporate it in the screen or just on the remote itself.
SPEAKER_00: I should put the advanced options onto the screen display.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, like you have a visual of the brightness with a sliding bar and a bus and stuff like that for sound and visuals.
SPEAKER_02: You should have a menu for all the issues.
SPEAKER_01: Make a drawing.
SPEAKER_01: Select.
SPEAKER_01: That's okay.
SPEAKER_02: That's very big.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we get there.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, well, this is basically a remote.
SPEAKER_01: Usually the power button is on top, I guess.
SPEAKER_02: It should fit right into your hand.
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_01: Most people are right-handed, so maybe less than a special decision, but okay.
SPEAKER_01: If you put it like here or something, I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: Then you can put a screen on a mobile phone, also on top, I guess.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but if you are using the normal functions, the basic functions, you normally do this.
SPEAKER_02: So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your thumb, also reach the middle, or you should screen at the bottom.
SPEAKER_02: Then you can see it very clearly.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so you have your hand and the screen is below and the buttons are in the middle.
SPEAKER_01: For example, if you put the screen here, it's more about the functions now than the layouts.
SPEAKER_01: It doesn't work too well.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Right.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, you get it.
SPEAKER_01: For example, if you put all the...
SPEAKER_01: Right.
SPEAKER_02: You want the normal piece of paper and there's a 10?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, my piece is...
SPEAKER_01: Kind of works.
SPEAKER_01: Like if you have 10 buttons for all the channels, an ear button for flipping.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: And the following?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's usually like here, here, here, here.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So we have up and down for the channels.
SPEAKER_01: Left and right.
SPEAKER_01: Left and right for the volume.
SPEAKER_02: Those can also be used for the menu.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah, exactly.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But this is really your department that we need just functional displays.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And for a cursor, this is function.
SPEAKER_01: And you...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: If you can use the...
SPEAKER_01: Most of the time you have one button in the middle.
SPEAKER_01: It says menu.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And then if you press it, the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down.
SPEAKER_01: And left and right to go into a function.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And then just...
SPEAKER_01: Most of the time this menu button is also like, okay, to confirm a kind of action.
SPEAKER_01: So you scroll into it, okay, you select a function like base.
SPEAKER_01: You just adjust it with these two buttons.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Then okay to confirm.
SPEAKER_01: And then on each screen, this should be an option to go back to an upper level.
SPEAKER_01: And then finally say, okay, exit or one button to exit it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: In one time, I don't know that's not really my department.
SPEAKER_01: That's more your department too.
SPEAKER_00: It's a logo on the remote control.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But it should be if the screen is here, then the logo should be on top.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, it's...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but that depends on where you put the screen.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's essential that there is a screen.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, the position of the screen is also more essential than...
SPEAKER_01: I mean, we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there.
SPEAKER_02: And for the speech recognition part, if we want to incorporate that, we need the microphone.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So it should be...
SPEAKER_01: I mean, if you have it in your hand here, it should be on top somewhere.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Why do we want to put the display in the bottom?
SPEAKER_02: No, that's not sure.
SPEAKER_02: That's not sure, but...
SPEAKER_01: Maybe.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe.
SPEAKER_03: Because if you use the functions, your hand will block the display.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_00: But that's only for the basic function.
SPEAKER_00: If you are going to use the iPhone option, you are going to press the menu button and then...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, the screen on top looks more...
SPEAKER_01: Normal.
SPEAKER_01: Logical to me also because people use mobile phones and they also have a screen on top.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So you just have to reach a little bit for the power button.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, if you grab it...
SPEAKER_01: Once it's on, it's on.
SPEAKER_01: But most of the times, if a TV is on standby, people just press the check.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we put it on top.
SPEAKER_01: So we put this on top and then make the corporate logo like over here, R-R.
SPEAKER_01: And the microphone, I mean, it can be very small if you look at your mobile phone.
SPEAKER_01: So these are some stripes, little holes.
SPEAKER_03: Maybe on the top or even on the side.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe on the side, I mean, if the microphone is good...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So on the top is better.
SPEAKER_03: But if you hold the remote like this, if you put it on the top on the side, I don't know.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It should be able to...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It doesn't...
SPEAKER_03: It doesn't...
SPEAKER_03: Okay, well, leave this up to you.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it doesn't matter that much.
SPEAKER_01: So...
SPEAKER_01: But the screen is on top.
SPEAKER_01: Which functions did we have left?
SPEAKER_01: I mean, this is basically numbers for you.
SPEAKER_01: For you.
SPEAKER_01: For you.
SPEAKER_01: Channel up and down.
SPEAKER_01: Channel up and down.
SPEAKER_02: Up there.
SPEAKER_02: Outphones options.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Maybe we should decide what outphones options we want to put in the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's a good one.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So we needed to integrate those sound and image options, right?
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Like...
SPEAKER_03: Sound.
SPEAKER_03: Sound.
SPEAKER_03: So we need kind of an equalizer.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Equalizer.
SPEAKER_01: So if you have sound.
SPEAKER_01: But not too advanced.
SPEAKER_01: Most TVs use only treble and bass.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Treble and middle bass or something.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's pretty hard to write.
SPEAKER_01: And...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: But you have sound?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Sound.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You have a digital...
SPEAKER_01: Better write it down over there.
SPEAKER_01: So we have sound.
SPEAKER_01: Just a...
SPEAKER_01: Secret.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Sound.
SPEAKER_01: And then...
SPEAKER_01: Within sound, I guess, treble and bass.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: The mono stereo option.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And also...
SPEAKER_03: There was something else also.
SPEAKER_03: And then...
SPEAKER_03: Pitch.
SPEAKER_01: Pitch.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But pitch isn't that...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's the height.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: The frequency is down.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Why would you use that?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Isn't this...
SPEAKER_03: It depends on the signal of the program you're watching.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And also the tuning part?
SPEAKER_01: Programming part.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Channel programming.
SPEAKER_01: So we have sound, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Channel programming.
SPEAKER_01: And...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: In the functionality of the...
SPEAKER_03: Telefician.
SPEAKER_03: No, no.
SPEAKER_03: Of the remote.
SPEAKER_03: Do we want the buttons to make sound when you press them?
SPEAKER_03: As a confirmation?
SPEAKER_03: Or whatever, you know?
SPEAKER_03: I don't know.
SPEAKER_01: I think it gets annoying.
SPEAKER_01: I mean, most mobile phones use that in the beginning.
SPEAKER_00: But...
SPEAKER_00: You can disable...
SPEAKER_03: Under the advanced option.
SPEAKER_03: You can put those in.
SPEAKER_00: The...
SPEAKER_00: The telefician itself has also the options with brightness and screen color, etc.
SPEAKER_00: So...
SPEAKER_00: Contrast.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: But people don't want to sit underneath...
SPEAKER_01: Underneath in front of the telefician which is usually only three buttons and it's very hard to.
SPEAKER_01: Contrast.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Contrast and brightness.
None: Point.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's the most used, I guess, if you don't get your money turned.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, well, I guess this were the only ones, I guess.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: It's easy.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: But so we have...
SPEAKER_03: We have TV options which is all this.
SPEAKER_03: The sound...
SPEAKER_02: The options.
SPEAKER_03: The sound image.
SPEAKER_03: And you have in the...
SPEAKER_03: The...
SPEAKER_03: Indeed.
SPEAKER_03: The remote control options.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: So we need two menus kind of thing.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: You have basically a button menu which you can use directly.
SPEAKER_02: Uh-huh.
SPEAKER_02: According to the opris port and the LCD options.
SPEAKER_02: Are activated based on some software options that's communicated with the infrared.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: With the chip and then trans...
SPEAKER_01: I mean...
SPEAKER_02: So you have an additional processor in.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Well...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: We have power button, whether that's present.
SPEAKER_01: Channel volume selection present.
SPEAKER_01: Numbers present.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Audio settings, monosterior pitch, bass, treble, screen settings, brightness and color.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Contrast this.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Color and brightness.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Um...
SPEAKER_01: And which is a channel setting.
SPEAKER_01: So channel programming.
SPEAKER_01: So you have an option to start scanning all the frequencies.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: And when it encounters one.
SPEAKER_01: Well, it shows on your TV.
SPEAKER_01: And then you can...
SPEAKER_01: Um...
SPEAKER_01: Uh...
SPEAKER_01: And then you can select a number in your remote.
SPEAKER_02: So the channel program is auto-seek.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Auto-seek.
SPEAKER_01: Uh...
SPEAKER_02: Name a channel.
SPEAKER_02: Or...
SPEAKER_01: Well, most TVs automatically display the name which they get through the cable.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, they get the ultimate name.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: So you only have to choose the position on your...
SPEAKER_01: It only has to match the channel frequency on your TV.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: With the position on your TV.
SPEAKER_01: And so your remote.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But can you also say I want Veronica on the channel number 5?
SPEAKER_01: If you already programmed it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: If you want to move it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That should be possible too.
SPEAKER_01: How do you call that?
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: How do you call that?
None: Mmm.
SPEAKER_01: Well, you should be able to browse through a list or something which displays all the values, all the channels which are possible.
SPEAKER_01: I mean like 1 to 30 or 4.9 here or whatever.
SPEAKER_01: Just browse through it and then...
SPEAKER_01: Um...
SPEAKER_01: Some kind of way.
SPEAKER_01: See if it is programmed.
SPEAKER_02: Swap channels?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Swap channels.
SPEAKER_02: Swap is good option.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So most of the time, if you swap it.
SPEAKER_01: Let's say for example you have RTL5 on channel 5.
SPEAKER_01: And Veronica on channel 8 and you want to move Veronica to channel 5.
SPEAKER_01: Most of the time you overwrite the previous one.
SPEAKER_02: Well, that's sort of...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: It's pretty...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I mean you have to look on the menu.
SPEAKER_03: Those are working.
SPEAKER_03: On the TV.
SPEAKER_02: Also.
SPEAKER_03: He only has to figure out how it has to look.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but also which buttons you have to press to get a certain result.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_02: The working design was to specify how the physical interaction between the components was.
SPEAKER_02: I...
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: It treated your homework.
SPEAKER_03: But um...
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Or is it too hard to just do it on your remote to program the channels?
SPEAKER_03: No.
SPEAKER_02: It should be able to do a thing with the television is difficult.
SPEAKER_02: But that's not our part.
SPEAKER_02: No.
SPEAKER_02: We don't have to design protocol.
SPEAKER_01: That's true.
SPEAKER_01: That's true.
SPEAKER_01: Thank God.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: So we have to figure out a way to do that easily.
SPEAKER_01: I mean the auto-secret is not a problem.
SPEAKER_01: You are a counter-channel and then it just says on which number do you want to save this?
SPEAKER_01: And you just press the number on your remote and then say confirm.
SPEAKER_01: And it's safe.
SPEAKER_01: It's easier.
SPEAKER_01: It's harder to, if you have already programmed it, to swap.
SPEAKER_02: So we have to think of something for that.
SPEAKER_02: The user interface design can design a menu for all the use functions.
SPEAKER_01: Kind of structure into layers.
SPEAKER_00: I mean you make a map with all the...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, because it's now...
SPEAKER_00: There are also documents.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, I can.
SPEAKER_02: I'll just try to reorganize things.
SPEAKER_02: So you design the basic function menu for the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_01: And the layout of the thing itself.
SPEAKER_01: I think the layout of the screen.
SPEAKER_02: I think you can concentrate more on the bit and placement and the placement of the screen itself on the...
SPEAKER_00: Isn't that more than the...
SPEAKER_00: This is the interface.
SPEAKER_02: No, I think there's more in...
SPEAKER_03: All the functional aspects of the...
SPEAKER_03: Maybe more than...
SPEAKER_03: I think I am in my department.
SPEAKER_03: I have to know what it has to do.
SPEAKER_03: So if you want to...
SPEAKER_03: You know, the changing the channels kind of thing is...
SPEAKER_03: I have to integrate that in the design.
SPEAKER_02: So you lay out your function.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: One function, okay.
SPEAKER_03: I think that's a good example.
SPEAKER_00: I have to make the menu layout also.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I guess so.
SPEAKER_02: I think that's your department.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: We have to kind of work together.
SPEAKER_03: If I make the...
SPEAKER_03: The menu, like...
SPEAKER_03: I have to state which function has to be in the menu and then you have to decide it in the way that is your friend.
SPEAKER_00: You are going to make a list of what functions are going to be on the menu screen.
SPEAKER_00: And I'm going to make a nice menu.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: With some layers in it.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And also...
SPEAKER_02: Make clear which buttons to press to get certain results.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Because that's always difficult to every device that's on...
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: I guess this button, the okay menu, okay.
SPEAKER_01: Or you can incorporate two different buttons like you have on your mobile phone.
SPEAKER_01: So this is only to get in the menu or to exit it.
SPEAKER_01: And then I want to confirm.
SPEAKER_01: I want to go one step back.
SPEAKER_01: So it's like the the say button on your mobile phone if you have a Nokia or like that or the no button.
SPEAKER_01: To go one step back, it's only two extra buttons.
SPEAKER_01: If it's very clear that they are for the screen.
SPEAKER_00: I think we have to make two groups.
SPEAKER_00: One group for the display and one group for the basic functions.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, but they're incorporated.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, because this is used for both.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: But maybe that's not...
SPEAKER_00: If you're zapping with your remote control, you can press the menu button and then you are suddenly into the...
SPEAKER_01: To your screen.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so you should leave the menu button out of here.
SPEAKER_01: And just put it under the screen.
SPEAKER_00: Just group.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we make these advanced functions and these basic functions.
SPEAKER_00: We make a line between them.
SPEAKER_01: But we should place the screen on top, right?
SPEAKER_00: Well, oh yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_00: We swap the...
SPEAKER_02: You use the port.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, you just find out and then the headlady is out.
SPEAKER_02: Do we do the extra two buttons or not?
SPEAKER_03: I think you should.
SPEAKER_03: It's easier if you put too many functions in one button, it gets confusing.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, okay, that's true.
SPEAKER_00: So we have a menu button and a...
SPEAKER_02: Okay, in Beck.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay, in Beck.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, our confirm and back.
SPEAKER_02: The four arrows.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: But those are still doubly used.
SPEAKER_01: Should we save this picture or, you know, what it looks like?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm not clear about the extra two buttons.
SPEAKER_00: We have a menu button.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Just to activate the screen.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, okay.
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_02: So you button access the menu in the LCD screen.
SPEAKER_01: And then with these buttons, you can navigate.
SPEAKER_01: You navigate.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: But you can also navigate the channels and the volume.
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so that's not...
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, those are both... both.
SPEAKER_03: Hey, is it interesting for users if we put lead lights under the buttons so that if you...
SPEAKER_03: Press on the menu function, that only the buttons that are used for the menu are...
SPEAKER_03: Liden up, yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: That's very good ID.
SPEAKER_02: Five minutes.
SPEAKER_01: All right.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's a good ID because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now which you can use.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: And then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Sure.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: So...
SPEAKER_01: Anything else?
SPEAKER_01: Those buttons are lit up.
SPEAKER_01: But just one thing.
SPEAKER_01: Should we use those two then?
SPEAKER_01: Or only this two to scroll?
SPEAKER_01: And then use the two functional buttons to confirm to go into something.
SPEAKER_01: Oh no, we have to use this to adjust...
SPEAKER_03: Or some some bars.
SPEAKER_03: Or keep it optional because maybe you can... you know, go left, right and up and down.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Maybe we should use this also as an okay button still.
SPEAKER_01: And then just only a back button.
SPEAKER_02: Well, we have those buttons.
SPEAKER_03: The problem with the okay button in the middle is sorry.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Sorry.
SPEAKER_03: It's...
SPEAKER_03: If you're pressing up and down, you can easily press it okay once you're not already at your...
SPEAKER_00: Or maybe make one okay button...
SPEAKER_00: And one back.
SPEAKER_00: And one navigation button.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: With the channel and the volume.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: A multifunctional navigation button.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: That's what we decided.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: Okay.
SPEAKER_03: So...
SPEAKER_02: You want to close down?
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I want to close down.
SPEAKER_02: Sorry.
SPEAKER_02: Sorry.
SPEAKER_02: Not because it doesn't like you.
SPEAKER_02: But we have lunch break already.
SPEAKER_02: And then we can work for 30 minutes.
SPEAKER_02: We'll have to write very fast to make the minute.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: And then we'll see.
SPEAKER_03: Alright.
SPEAKER_03: How long is the lunch break?
SPEAKER_02: I don't know.
SPEAKER_02: We have to ask all of me.
SPEAKER_00: Do we have to write down our stuff now?
SPEAKER_00: First lunch break.
SPEAKER_00: I believe that's first lunch break.
SPEAKER_00: Everything in my head now.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: There you go.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Okay.
SPEAKER_00: Yes.
SPEAKER_01: I think you can put a laptop back in the room.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Yes, sir.
SPEAKER_02: Time pressure.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's a lot of pressure.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: Sorry for my not finished presentation.
SPEAKER_03: Sorry.
SPEAKER_03: Yeah.
SPEAKER_03: We'll kick your ass later.
SPEAKER_01: Bring it on.
SPEAKER_01: I don't know if it works.
SPEAKER_01: You saved it.
None: That's safe.
None: Out of my head.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: We'll see.
SPEAKER_01: Just shoot back my laptop.
SPEAKER_01: Smart board.
SPEAKER_01: Alright.
SPEAKER_01: You can use it.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_01: You can open it with picture preview or stuff like that.
SPEAKER_00: Some maps with all the data we have.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I tried to organize it by these three.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: It's just my own map.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: I don't really mind.
SPEAKER_02: I just put the minutes here.
SPEAKER_02: We'll see.
SPEAKER_00: But you've got some actual information.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: That's in the functional design.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_02: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: It's just basically what I just showed.
SPEAKER_00: Where do you get?
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_00: I got it by the only one.
SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: I'm glad you're here.
SPEAKER_02: I don't do it.
SPEAKER_01: Okay.
SPEAKER_01: Alright.
None: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Make me proud.
SPEAKER_03: I'll try to.
SPEAKER_03: So first we have a lunch break now.
SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
SPEAKER_02: Alright.
SPEAKER_02: I believe so.
SPEAKER_02: Oh, just ask.
SPEAKER_03: Mm-hmm.
SPEAKER_03: I don't know where she's at though.
None: Okay.
