 o This is our last meeting. I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting. And then we'll have the prototype presentation. Then we will do an evaluation. We'll see what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation. Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget. Then we'll do the evaluation and then we can finish up after that with changes that we'll need to make. Or hopefully everything will fall right in line. See minutes from the last meeting. We looked at the trends. We had the fashion trends that people want to fancy look and feel. It was twice as important as anything else. They liked fruit and vegetables and the new styles. And a spongy feel. So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype. They wanted limited buttons and simplicity. Then we looked at the method for coming up with our own remote. Looking at other devices. The iPod. We really like to look at that. We also had the kids remote for a simple idea. A two part remote, which was what we were originally looking at. And then there was talk of speech recognition becoming more predominant and easier to use. But I think we still decided not to go with that. Then we looked at the components. The materials for the case, the different energy sources, the different types of chips. And made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote. And basically. How what we were making for the prototype. So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys. Take over. The prototype. Yeah, do you need this? No. There he is. I'll have a blog about it. Yeah, basically we went with the color yellow. Working on the principle of a fruit, which was mentioned, basically designed around a banana. But it would be held in such a fashion. Whereas obviously it wouldn't be that floppy because this would be hard plastic. These would be like the rubber, the rubber grips. So that's how helpful the hell we grip. The ergonomics would be done with this scroll wheel. And this here represents the screen where you'd go through. And the simplest function would be almost identical to an iPod. And that one way through channels, that way with other way through channels. Volume up and down. And then to access the more complicated functions. So you press that and go through the menus. It's that simple. That's just represents the infrared beam. That's a simple or an off switch. I don't know we could use the voice. That blue bit should be yellow. That would be where the batteries would be. And that's about it. It's a simple. We can make it. Is anything else? That's what we have. That's plastic. Plastic covered with rubber. We might add some more underneath here. Maybe give it a form. I mean we're supposed to hold it like that. But she grabbed it. Yeah, it's just made. It's definitely just rough. Left hand in order. And they just both. Exactly. These both might as well. The actual thing might be smaller. Think about the bottom. Yeah. Either put either one on either side. Not too at all. Just a quick on-off button. That's pretty important. So you don't have to fit over that. Okay. That's not. I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice. Yeah. Play with that over there. Nice flimsy because it's made out of heavy. Right. Do you like to? Well done. Kind of a banana. No, whether or not it would fall into the costume and everything I suppose. Would they scroll and they all see the. Well, luckily we are going to find out. Or not luckily. Do you have a marketing. I do presentation for us. Okay. So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria. That I found just based on the past. Turn the reports that I was looking at earlier. And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype. And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did. So the criteria we're going to be looking at. Are the complaints. That we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier. So. We're going to be doing it based on a seven point scale. And one is going to mean true that we did actually achieve that. With seven being false we did not achieve that. Okay. So for the first one we need to decide did we solve the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote. I think it's definitely different than anything else out there. So if they think that what is out there is ugly then yes. I would say most definitely it's bright. But still has your traditional black. It's curved. There's no sharp angles to it. Not angular. It comes to the ergonomics, the form and stuff. Yes, that's definitely more beautiful than your average. However the color. We don't have to say in that. We have to say that we have to say that we have to solve the problem completely. Because the color is ugly. There's nothing you can say about that. I much prefer something like brushed chrome. Yeah. That form. Yeah. Something more modern to go. Right. A modern color to go with the modern form. But it's different. You don't want your three feet huge LCD display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that. Okay. So do you think since we this wasn't assigned criteria? Do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle of them? Yeah. Yeah. What do you think? Three, four. Four. Four. Okay. Very non-committal four. Okay. The second one. Did we make it simple for new users? It's very intuitive. I think. Yeah. That was the main name. The main names that we had. One. One? Yeah. Okay. Do the controls now match the operating behavior of the users? Yeah. We brought it down to basically four controls where they did the most common channel and volume. And then the other one was just a matter of just going further. Just scrolling through and selecting. So one? Yeah. I think that's a one. Okay. Okay. The fourth one. How about the problem of a remote being easily lost? One of the number one. Something that big and that yellow you just don't know. What do you want to know? I'm going to lose. But if we were to, if we were that speech recognition that we could maybe just use that solely for the finding thing. That was what we mentioned. So if we incorporate speech recognition into it, then just to use to find it. If it was lost, but like I said, you lose something so yellow so easily. And it's not going to fall like a rectangle. Slick down behind things. That's going to be a difficult shape. Well, it is quite bright. Yeah. Maybe in the middle again, three or four or something. Okay. I mean, you know, losing things is one of those things that people can lose. Yeah. I mean, a million ways you can pick it up and walk away with it and then you lost it. But if we do go with the with the speech recognition, then it, then our scale goes up quite a bit. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Probably probably two. You know, if we eliminate the fact that, you know, it's impossible to guarantee that it's not going to be lost. Let's say two. With speech recognition, which of course may be changed depending on budget. Yeah. So we could add an extra feature actually, which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from television. Yeah. We could add that, but that's nothing we have thought of. Which, which may be cheaper than speech recognition. It would just stay. Yeah, true. But I mean, just those whistling clappens, cravings, you have that shape. So I can't be that. And the space on this anti anti-thas Sort of proximity. Or suitcases and stuff where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage, another piece that starts beeping that can't cost much. Yeah. So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to hide. So you have one piece, you have to glue somewhere behind your TV. Stick it behind your TV and the other. I'm afraid that you don't accidentally lose that piece. Right. That'd be tough. Well, also your remote would alarm you if somebody stole your TV to your television. Ran off of that without taking the beautiful remote control. Yeah. So, are we adding one of these two features? Let's add one of those features and say yes. Okay. So we're back to a one. Or two. Two. Two. Okay. Are we technologically innovative? I'd say so. I don't get my name up. It's all just souls with screen. It's all just stolen. Yeah. But there's not a lot of yellow. There's not a lot of yellow. Of course I wasn't really forced to take that color. Two. Okay. I don't know the way you are that innovative. It's too true. But how many robots do you see like this? If we added the screaming factor. Then we go up. I would say we're probably up four. Really? Okay. It's going to hurt us. Okay. Spongy material. Yeah, we do have that. We have some splashes. It's native. Okay. It's not a one though. One would be the whole thing. Yeah, because it's only got to fold and stuff. Like these parts of the grips and perhaps the back side, the bottom underneath on the back. So lots of four. Probably four at most. Lastly, did we put the fashion in electronics? Yes. Yes. Your fashion is but is Carmen Miranda? You betcha. Well, the recent fashion is rather displayed in the LCD. It's true. And you operated the form on the color, but it definitely is. What we were told. Definitely. Okay. All right. Now I just got to calculate. 17. 17. 17. 17. 17. Jesus and Amas, You bet whistlebl Right? How does that work? I'm impressed I can't do that without a calculator. No, I'm fine. It's been a while. And what is the acceptable criteria? Is there like a scale that we have to hit? Oh no, I just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it. Basically. All right then. So that's that. Okay, well, let's see. Now we get to do the budget numbers. You didn't know that you were going to have a budget. But we do. Okay. It's been going a long time. It's 2.4 to 8. I said it was too strong. Oh my gosh. 2.4 to 8. Yeah, we're going to have that. So I have here 50% be pretty. Yeah. We want a 50% profit on this. I can't really see that very well. Just about finished quickly. 12 and a half euros is what's supposed to cost us. Okay, so. It's too much. Well, let's see. The. This. Okay. All right. All right, so. I don't know if you guys can read that enough. I can't sit on my glasses on. But so we've got the energy source. There's a four, five, six categories. We have energy source electronics case. Then we have case material supplements interface type. And then button supplements. Okay, so. First of all, energy source. We pick battery. And how many batteries do we think this will probably take? Probably. So either two or four. Two. Two. Like it. Four is going to be too heavy. So that's not our problem. People can change it every month. They won't. Oh, I thought I thought I bought it. This is consumerism. All right. So for the electronics, our choices are simple chip on print, regular chip on print, advanced chip on print, sample sensor, sample speaker. Advanced chip, that's the advanced chip on print. Okay. We have one of those. Okay. Then the case is a. Probably that's double curved. Yes. Case materials are. Plastic. Plastic. I guess it's two since one for the top one for the bottom. Is that right or is it just one? Oh, maybe it's one because of the. It's just one single mode. Yeah. I guess it doesn't matter because the price on that one is zero. Right. Special color. That's not a special color. Especially ugly color. Interface type. We have push button scroll wheel interface. Integrated scroll wheel push button LCD display. So we actually have the LCD display. And then is it the integrated or. Absolutely. Yes. Okay. Button supplement special color. Special form. Special material. We could of course make the buttons would. Same how can they. Really love or titanium. The cost is all. But we only have one button. So really we shouldn't be charged. We shouldn't be charged anything. The button supplements. Yeah. Okay. We're going to leave that one blank because we run on a LCD. Scroll. So our total is 15.5. Which I believe. Is. Three euros over. So we go for the hand. So the only thing better than a banana shape remote is one of the. One that you shake. What if we completely took out the one single button we've got on. And just had a scroll wheel interface. And the LCD's way. I suppose the LCD's way is the one that's putting it off a bit. Yeah. Well, because we have to have both, right? That's a basic. It also depends on the software on the television you can have. The information that's been translated on the screen. You could maybe take out the LCD's. If it comes up on the computer itself, on the TV itself. And you're not needed. There you go. There we go. There we go. Twelve point five. Okay. So we just remove our screen here. Big a dial. Easy to use. Easy to use on. Besides, look at what the LCD does to our lovely remote. Back to the design room, boys. Take away a heck of water. What's the blue part? That was just, we ran out of yellow. There you go. There you go. It was simpler. Looks more like a banana. Feels a few little bit out there. Okay. Cost under twelve point five zero. No. We redesigned it. Now it's yes. Next slide. Project evaluation. Project process satisfaction with, for example. Creativity leadership team work means new ideas found. So I guess that. I think that perhaps the project evaluation is just supposed to be complete by me. But I'd like to hear your thoughts. What did you think of our project process? We don't quite well. Team work. Right from the start of the day. Yeah. We started off a little week. Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning. But as the day went along, we had more idea of what we were doing. Room for creativity. I think it was interesting as you guys brought up more information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things. You guys work together. Well team. And the means. Which was the white board depends. I had some problem with the pen. I think. Minus your power point. Minus your power point. My father. No, I know. People I worked for. Have a list of employees that you would like fired. Yes. Yes. For the remote. Maybe no. For technology. Closing. Cost or within the budget. Project is evaluated. Complete final questionnaire and meeting someone. That's it. I still have to do my minutes. So there will probably be another. Question air coming up. And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can. What goes on after that. That's the end of our meeting.
