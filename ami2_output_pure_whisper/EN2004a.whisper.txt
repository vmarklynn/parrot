 Okay. So the preview and let's see myself and Micah is not here and occasionally Melissa will all be doing checking by the transcriptions so this is the second pass the transcriptions are receiving and that's pretty straightforward I think you'll basically have an idea what's involved but the extra step that we're asking me to do in this case is to look at the silent regions and listen to them for each channel and make sure that no bat channels were lost for example yeah bat channels is what you typically would find although by and large these are gonna be silent so so you can start checking by well you know you can order it in any way you like but start with the first channel and go through it entirely I would recommend I've found that it's easier when you're checking and you're trying to make sure the boundaries are right for speech segment I would recommend like say this one go down here to the transcription transcription tier and select that it so that when you play you're certain that when it stops you've caught the whole speech signal for that utterance and haven't lost any signal information otherwise it's liable to keep on running and you might not notice where it finishes so it takes a little time but alternatively you could just listen to the speech segments again and make sure everything's correct for those and so you could just like that and then go back and check the the silence regions if you want to make your job a little more interesting do it in different ways on a different day as long as it gets done so so we're checking what's actually been transcribed already as well as the side yeah yeah you're doing so that's that's the role of the checkers to check what's said in the speech regions and then make sure nothing was lost in the silent regions you're also responsible for resolving uncertainties that were marked by the original transcriber and and you know of course there are gonna be many situations where you like the first transcriber can't make any sense of it and in that case it will be up to you to use the at symbol and that can be used to represent one unintelligible word or multiple intelligible words but just use one at symbol yeah exactly and so that once you go through all the speech regions and all the non speech regions and that you could make another step of doing a search using going under the edit menu you can do a search for your place yeah fine new place for open parentheses and that'll take you to the first transcriber might have marked out so there's one and then you can just resolve those all one by one as a different set of changes together and and likewise for the double question marks just once you've gone through and resolved all the open parentheses you can do the same for double question mark and and like I said if you if you can't make any sense of it then just use that symbol if you can just give it you know give it your best guess how much would you want I had a few times where I thought well it could be this mm-hmm but if you're not entirely sure that it could be because it could be a combination something else yeah the guests down or leave it as ambiguous in some way yeah it's I would if you if you're quite certain then I would go ahead and type what you think it was said if you think that there's a chance maybe a 30% chance you're wrong or more usually context problem yeah yeah sometimes if it's not intelligible you either tend to because you really wanted to fit the context you tend to take the closest actual work that would fit the context or if it sometimes it sounds very clear as a word itself but then wouldn't make sense at all and then question you know second guess whether it's really what you heard right so maybe a good idea would be to listen to each channel one by one do listen to the silent and non-silent regions and make all those corrections leave the unknowns the impurities the uncertainties uncertainties until later so go through all the channels and do that and then you should have the context from all four speakers and then go back and do those searches one by one for each channel how would that be yeah okay what should be for the passage of what they're talking about you know you're in the same time to think that would be really helpful that would help us now a good number of those uncertainties if there's a chance that it's equally likely that they could have said something or they could have said something like I scream I scream they just choose one and leave it choose one I mean think of it from a speech recognition point of view again and always this should be the should be yeah what is most robust for speech recognition and and leave out we just started as we try to be sure the sign so you will get so I've done so oh no I don't know when I did my masters I took SP one and SP two with someone okay we have to be teachers for SP two okay I'll ask you later on like this okay okay so this is one I've gone through I've just done one channel and there were lots of lots and lots of things as you can see because I've got square brackets around all the things that need to be changed so this person didn't obviously didn't know about capitalization so just about every other instance to be capitalized and need and punctuation you never need like someone's talking and there's this of pause in the middle of a sentence it's long enough for it to put a break in but they're actually sort of carrying on the sentence do you have to capitalize each time you transcribe a bit no no no whatever makes sense to you okay but no it can continue into the next segment and that's perfectly hyphen that's actually the only case where you don't or were you not supposed to capitalize right right so if it's quite clear that the sentence is being carried on you know the sentence for a previous segment is being carried on and that's when you don't capitalize I don't really use the hype and I think when the sentence is definitely not continuing anyway yeah I've never seen this wrong man I'll review some of these things after I go through this a bit just to recap these are things that I after checking everybody's work these are things that were commonly left out or mis-transcribed whatever so I'll go over those as an opportunity okay so this person left out a lot of end punctuation and here's a case where I think she was transcribing an out breath or possibly in breath in and use the hash mark in any case I didn't hear anything and and you shouldn't be transcribing in breaths or out breaths that's information we don't need oh you know this is the headset yeah it was a quicky voice yeah it was creepy so it's really connected to the word yeah yeah and you're sometimes you don't know whether it's my choice or that person's making it yeah well I didn't think it was yeah this is actually quite a bit more in there before so I heard a creaky voice and it was audible of the level of the rest of the speech so I would I would keep that oh okay I was adding that there you go so there's things like that there's a missing false start here so I added that in so that that's something that's quite common in the transcriptions I've looked at missed false starts missed and how exact you have to be there because you know some people tend to stutter more than others and then they would have a full start four or five tabs in a row and how important is it to listen to it really until you've got the exact number of the things right try to get it right I mean I think syllables should be accounted for because they go yeah well don't let it drive you crazy because there is one speaker Melissa just played for me today and he stutters horribly unfortunate it's really gonna be a nightmare to transcribe so you will have to play somewhere but if you if it's a four repeated the word is repeated four times then that's not too hard to come I haven't come across something I haven't come across anything exceeding four I think have you well it's not that the word is if the word where the whole word would be used in that would have been that difficult but sometimes it's just a false start which is really just maybe one or one and a half phones and then repeat it and then you don't really know whether one is a long duration of one or whether it's actually two yeah yeah I think it's a thing was a word starting with the and the person was going did it it make your best guess yeah try to listen to it carefully enough but not not so that you're obsessing over it for I would say sometimes with the does I would be thinking are you anticipating it you're trying to say this well there again think about robustness it really doesn't matter it's a word fragment you're marking it as a fragment and that's important yeah if somebody has an accent that you can only really understand what they're saying to world knowledge that what they say it doesn't really actually send it all you know what it is then do you transcribe more phonetically or do you put a star after every single one word or well I wouldn't be using the stars so liberally yeah that's what I'm not going to do it but the one there's one I'm prescribing right now you know a whole patch of dialogues where all four participants are non-native especially one there that I think he's Eastern European and I think I'm feeling like an understand what he's saying at all but if you would just play it I think to recognize her then what he says you know the way he realizes words so it's nothing at all like it should be well right right and I mean and for that matter a lot of native English speakers realizations aren't going to be so true to try to take consistency if they always stress the wrong part of the word then I think okay I'll let that in yeah it becomes out and like one word is no it's less of a stress it's really like yeah well I wouldn't bother to mark all of those instances well you can't really be good no I mean yeah they're there you're gonna find that for any speaker realizing these things and and it's just like if you're never saying that the word that stands out is something really I went like I'm thinking of I use this example before there's a guy who says project instead of product and it's something like project and it's probably just his pronunciation project yeah well it they were clearly talking about a product so I marked that as a mispronunciation or something to flag anyway oh evaluation yeah I remember that when I would I would flag just like you did that's something definitely to mark it but that's really something I would always subscribe it you know for lack of better knowledge of contact and at the end of the dialogue it dawned on me that and then I went back and replaced we have a lecture that I can never quite tell if you say problem or program I can't actually say when I'm listening to it yeah I don't know what to tell you about certain speakers it's just I think just do your best and hope for the best I won't be transcribing yeah okay so there have been lots of missed Philip pauses everybody seems to miss those some more than others so just really keeping you out for those it's easy to because you're so used to tuning them out when I go back over I nobody like go back to the beginning do a quick pass of the main sections again this second pass we should really try to catch yeah it should be after you know you stand nice to the the people do we need to go through and change ones that people did the only file that's been checked is Melissa one that Melissa did so we were starting fresh with these and you know changes like that that we're just announced we'll be able to catch yeah these first passes okay so yeah if you do see something like UHM from yeah to the regular version and we just you know this is arbitrary but we had to do something and not yeah get to convoluted choice here's so if they pause just where you got a highlight at the moment mm-hmm that was the hyphen mm-hmm so I have to read you the meetings from the minutes from the last week was she was that I'd like we will definitely I'm starting a new sentence here because I sometimes if it sounds like you carry on saying the whole sentence I sometimes don't have a hyphen that any but it is a bad patient yeah yeah yeah so it's not necessarily restoring a sentence yeah just a restart of things you know I'm afraid not even maybe to well if I think if you think of it in terms of a syntactic tree yeah doesn't have to go back all the way to the SNO it might go back to the last one to the next daughter thank you that was somebody that didn't know about linguistics are trying to transcribe it's just my way of yeah sorry because linguistics all I've ever known here's a so that answers your question sorry that answers your question this one okay here's where I heard a another sound another false start or stutter I'm not seeing your three lines in okay okay okay okay so I think and there was a vowel in there but you notice that she just used it and that's fine is that she would like see she does it is that oh sorry were you fretting up etc is that how we're supposed to be writing it yes yes she's so she's built it well up here oh yeah so I mentioned that because it's really and yes any is it one word or two words it's one word okay so I just said spelling management sorry but is that like etc like at all you like 80s you know like you know when you have when you have a set you say at all means and others at all at all you and etc means and following so in the dictionary here it's one word yeah if you have any questions about spelling I think I'm might have sent an email to this back just check the Oxford English dictionary okay that will be our guide so as far as I know this is just missing the set to but anyway you can we've considered experimenting with running this through a spell check you can take this as an emax file and run a spell check but I think it would slow things down too much yeah so just hopefully in going through this very carefully you're going to notice these misspellions if if somebody could write I don't know how difficult it would be in practice to read a script that would ignore all the word fragments anything with the hype and then as well that might make sense but to just use simple enix it will basically mark all the word fragments for you you know and I know from experience at some point you also get neglected you just click okay okay okay yeah you might miss a real error yeah I think you're right so we will just hope that you catch it that's what we'll do yeah the sea um okay so so I think she just she didn't catch she was cutting off rather than saying she would like to see right something yeah she I think she meant to use the infinitive but she just left off but she is a whole word should not be in space between a space in the movie she would like to see she would like to know that the sea and the hype and she would know be yes yes yes you're right yeah exactly thanks that way you are here we go let me see that okay what else um be careful about um finding mistranscriptions so um the wood and so she she transcribed that as wood sometimes it's really difficult sometimes we really don't know whether I think it's quite clear yeah I mean obviously there but if it's not clear do you just pick do you just pick the more grammatical term chip or no you try to keep it as true to what it's been said but if it's really not absolutely not clear then use when they say warm instead you know some people when they just swallow up the the last bit or do just ventro time to hear it because it sounds like it could be a fragment I just have to hear um I you don't want to be prescriptive and type what you think they should have said but but I do know the type of scenario you're describing I just it's just hard to answer that without hearing something um yeah they should all I stopped marking just too many but should they because they lose oh yeah right that's right yeah okay yes was that okay oh yeah another missed false start there was creakiness on the she but you don't need to mark that as a separate sound sometimes I've made but soft and like words after laughter I've made them capitalized because I've not been sure if the sun if the laughter's been cutting everything off mm-hmm and it sounds like um the laughter is just um interrupting the an utterance that continues after the laughter I wouldn't know where you're okay but capitalizing so what about if a whole advance is uttered while laughing so you put the laughter what I would that happens what I do is I put laughter in front and the whole thing and then laughter and you know at the end as well if you hear just laughter on either side yeah do that no it's it's laughter throughout yeah you know I don't know we'll have oh some people laughing themselves silly at absolutely nothing well they speak okay so laughter during speech I'll talk to you because in the iksy dialogues they always say you know while laughing and we don't do that so they say other so there it's really not ambiguous whether it's just laughs followed by an enormous spoken utterance or whether it's an utterance spoken while laughing there is a distinction there and we don't have a no we don't have any quality tags with these but um I'll I'll figure that one out and put it up on the wiki or you know you good question come across that as well yeah I don't know what that that noise was in the game we can skip on other types of things i want to point out let's see that's so cute i forget she's a person it calls circuit circuit did she say circuit i don't know i'm not sure would you have been tempted just put an asterisk um if it's her i just caught the end of it and no not for that one so i had one person who said so cute oh okay on it i thought asterisk is something where um it's pronounced as a totally different work like evaluation and no not necessarily no it's just something that the speech recognizer is labeled trip up on because this is a very frequent mistake that no 90 speakers made to say so cute um that may be but i probably would flag it i depending on how how different about soundless it's gonna be your call in a lot of these things like if i did that one because it is well a language teacher wouldn't like allow that to like move on to the next day that wouldn't they wouldn't let that pass so off okay if somebody i'd point out to them here's a case of um where i found it uh found a case of discontinuity but you know because she's an unnative english speaker i don't i don't know maybe that was grammatically unmarked for her you know what i mean maybe that wasn't her restarting maybe otherwise you could end up putting a hyphen up to every presentation mark we have so again i don't know that that was my reflex at the time to put that there but just a prosodic marker rather than their natural pole presentation yeah as in their homes like back channel oh yeah sorry i destroyed the rest of the sentence it's push buttons towards yeah yeah yeah i would type it as too hunker um okay i'm gonna skip ahead oh let's see so i i hear she would quite clear yeah and i think a good number of them you'll be able to resolve okay just just tops to have the context and be able to should or should well okay so there's there's another case where there wasn't a space between right uh a non-word fragment and then restart okay what else there is an extra little symbol in here it's just kind of carelessness so even if it's something as brief as mm-hmm we're gonna go ahead and capitalize that um marica asked me what to do in case of an utterance just consisting of laughter do we we use punctuation in these cases i don't know i think it's not too silly it's not linguistic um no yeah i know i yeah you could think of an i'm just thinking of you know a matter of consisting entirely of laughter and then putting like punctuation like uh-huh so i was gonna have fun transcribing my name it's not a conversation in the common room like i just love to think with state then they could come on really i'm trying to interpret my note here do we and clap for songs and things okay i guess they're just really wasn't enough to transcribe them yeah because it was it was really just silence yeah so like i said click down here just to if you haven't learned that trick already and that won't play any surrounding segments so there's nothing there um there's no distance the random years like we're having a hike in the form because uh scroll up a little bit uh-huh yeah that um the second off from the top is yeah i'm gonna have to go back and find where places where i've had someone pausing and then saying yeah yeah and then this i've not had i need to go back and find oh so you haven't put i put it i see i see okay hyphens or commas commas yeah for for that or absolutely absolutely so the app actually where i um a couple times where they've repeated a word i've put a comma between them should that be no comma commas are fine and eventually they're going to be extracted globally so it doesn't matter oh yeah we can just wipe the nose okay i get quite prolific with my commas at times i am too like commas and then uh Steve Reynolds was in project manager had looked at me i think it was my transcript all these commas doing in the he didn't ultimately he said it wasn't um okay cool they will they'll help in the case of discourse marketing but his point was that they're really subjective and so that you the transcriber here just to make sense of yeah i really like using commas yesterday oh she spelled cutest with an i so that's just something i pointed out okay what else yes so here's let's see now this was uh at one step behind so she typed uh hour and i i didn't quite hear that but but oh you can see how it could have been i don't know yeah sometimes you get like uh i think you're not sure if it's an i and i yeah i don't know right and you can never know but if it fits well enough as an as an indefinite article then yeah as well so which did you just oh i was i was suggesting that it be uh instead of hour yeah it's tricky um i don't know well oh she's i hear the well there yeah but this being the headset my channel may make it easier to hear she transcribes from the lapel mic i've had one person with the dodgy headphone word oh don't do something where oh most of the time it's it's as if they've got the handover something oh god and you transcribe that speaker entirely yeah if that comes up again we've got um headset mic files now in fact they replaced all the lapel mic files on the mmm server with headset mic files which we weren't asking them to do but anyway they did it and so now we don't have the lapel mic files apparently the headset mic files are are just a bit louder and so you'll probably find yourself turning the volume down considerably but but apparently other than that they're just as good right but let us know because we can retrieve the there was some people that actually leads to some really screeching noises because they're so loud or probably the mic is so close and this one um in one of the first dialogues i did the guy called Ed you could always see the waveform actually you know being just hitting the the boundaries on both ends and just being at some point just black segments and when he was talking there was this whole like you know when you speak to those two microphones people let's say is this on the right hit it if you tell okay i don't think i'm gonna go through uh any more of these because i think i've gotten through most of the types that i meant to point out how about names that somebody says the name of somebody and you think ooh i need to have to spell the name right if you heard the right name right um what are we going to do for that so oh i had one guy one of the project managers was um he had a really weird accent and he was calling um one guy mr. Ed and took me to find out that it was actually mr. Ed mystery no but that it wasn't one word that it wasn't like some proper name starting with m m. mr. i did see i've been looking at some guidelines for another corpus and i did see something about proper names so i'll have a look at that and see how we can have a look but don't you guys have um have this data but no other people people think it's like when you uh yeah quite possibly but since it's coming from it's coming from idiop and switzerland yeah it it should be easy enough to get but it's it's one other step you know emailing somebody to find out who knows this information anyway it's no but it's information that we theoretically have yeah yeah because everyone signs a consent form when they participate in the experiment so we ought to be able to get that in someone but there's we should also have a means of dealing with proper names when we don't know what it is or how it might be spelled at all and and flagging that in in some way so i'll i'll try to address both things okay what was mr again i can't remember seeing how to please correct mr oh just just type mr fully m i s t e r yeah and same with mrs m i s s s u s u s i believe i believe check check the dictionary that's mrs yeah you would never um type the abbreviated spelling what if somebody calls themselves me is it um i mean i said well i'm sure there's a spelling in the oed yeah so um what about um foreign words uh what do we do when we're checking if we come up something oh right so the transcribers includes anything in carrots yeah and what you would do is which i thought it was french so i knew how to explain that's a good question because you will be leaving question marks there um i mean if it's in carrots and then there's foreign does that matter um it shouldn't because things are going to be left like the asterisk will be left for the yeah post ads the subsequent processing but carrots with question marks in between would have to be resolved in some way okay we just change it to a nap between the carrots yeah because it's an intelligible thing yeah i i suppose that's all we can do really yeah supposed to be probably go oh so even if we know what the word means when as opposed to oh yeah yeah if you if it fits the foreign word and you know what it is just enclose it in carrots yeah because i have there's one dollar where i think two speakers are french like one is definitely french and i know she's saying and then somebody's say from her and she goes come off yeah you know that yeah yeah if you if you're confident you get a fair grasp on french for example when i accidentally translating the process yeah okay um there was there was just one other thing she she typed okay um in caps oh yeah so it left oh oh capital o capital k and huge no no i don't know why she missed that in the guidelines are we doing okay just as oh okay not as it okay ay it is okay ay ay ay ay okay yeah okay well it will be your jobs so you catch all of these things so no um no transcriber will be checking no checker will be checking their own own transcription yes yes so transcribe all between the way we'll catch these things i have to remember that more efficiently i think and i so i'll just go to the board do i have to keep this stuff on because it depends on how you stretch clips oh yeah because every time somebody be going over there you'd hear all the sound that's the white all right you hear the chairs moving and and about five or six breaks in between is the making the way there okay so i guess just for the sake of using the white board and killing a little more time i'll just write down the things that are most common to be checked so let's see so oh okay well the whiteboard marker is a camera as well it's like some wow pieces okay so all right rather this is a list of things to do as the checker so you want to listen to the silent regions then check the speech regions and as part of that you want to check the boundaries and oh by the way this should be transcribe any mist speech and let's see what else okay and within this checking the speech segments you want to listen for or look for mist look for mist punctuation filled pauses words in stuttering and if you have um you have a stuttered word you don't need to use the python to mark discontinuity it's just like so if somebody says the the then it's just the the words in and false starts short words make sure little words like the and little articles and that kind of thing don't get omitted short words and word fragments those are the commonly missed things and then look for cases of mistranscription seems so silly to be running but anyway mistranscription so make sure if the speaker said will you type will not would or if they say we even though it might be more grammatically correct to type we're um that kind of thing um that cases of ellipsis where maybe the transcriber typed them but really what was said was um so we use the apostrophe and look for capitalization i'm not gonna do any more of this capitalization spelling um use the oed to check on things you don't know about um refer to the wiki for all regularized spellings and for things like field pauses i just remember oh was that okay when it's just a k but it's at the beginning of a sentence should be k-e-e capitalized and then yeah capitalized the k and i think it smells really good i even did this too long i used to always love small markers i became addicted to this so crease plate what else did i find um so the make sure the the dash the hyphen whatever you call it is being used appropriately in cases of discontinuity um but not in stuttering like i said and and don't use it when the utterance is clearly continued in the next segment or whatever um don't transcribe in breaths or out breaths and okay should never be um to capital letters it should be okay ay um and one other thing is to break break up long segments if you find any so over a minute yeah but that's a kind of crude guideline i'd i'd say just anything that seems unmanageable so if something is a minute and three seconds i can still have it yeah yeah really it means nothing to say a minute it's just a really crude guideline i would just try to keep segments very manageable and but you use these waveforms to help you and you can adjust the resolution so that that didn't help me too much but you can use this little slide bar to adjust the resolution um which um the arrows by the resolution it will yeah in this one yeah not that one the other one next trip this one yeah right okay okay so yeah yeah oh and you can also go to signal and something under signal where you can adjust the amplitude as well on the resolution mm-hmm okay right nothing that's not if you go to control panel uh-huh single control panel no i'm single control here um the vertical zoom you can adjust that as well so it puts in these two slides and you're okay all right that's good okay all right i think i have nothing i was hearing stuff but i there was nothing on my way for it yeah i have to find where everything was oh let's let's go to control panel yeah so to help you make cuts just look and use this waveform and make sure you're not using any signal information but um cutting segments down is a low priority but it ever helped ultimately i think post-processing wise i don't have got a bit far and cutting right down that's important yeah you don't don't get excessive about it because that just ends up taking too much time but i i think from a speech recognition point of view it shouldn't matter the segments being whatever length that they happen to be i've seen other people's transcription guidelines like for the xc project at Berkeley and elsewhere say indicating it really doesn't matter and the point is just to get them into manageable units and easy to checking it right rather than to listen to a hole yeah yeah yeah yeah that's true actually that's the best reason for cutting now but hopefully that that'll be done during the first pass because that's all for making the checkers job will be easier and then yeah just be sure after you've gone through the four channels to do a search on all the unknowns all the cases of ambiguity or whatever and what else was i gonna say the way we'll be allocating this is as the same as before it's going to be on the same page just further down scroll down you'll see all the files and i've already allocated some some things to be checked so if you run out of work go ahead and start checking because this is something that's considerably bottlenecked moment says this the priority then yeah i'd say for now um we don't even have much new stuff to be you know it's gonna be gone over for a first pass so it's important that we do this second pass and i've indicated in a column whether something is priority i think a high high it's high priority and so that doesn't be the ones you could focus on first obviously and you don't want to change the file name in any way just keep it the same um there there's going to be a checking in procedure i don't know anybody's mentioned this before but you'll you'll know about this with the cbs so yeah so i don't know about i know about this for the summarization i haven't done this right but it'll be similar but they're they're creating a there a guy Jonathan is creating a web form for you to do this all very simply like just um upload everything that you upload the file that you've transcribed and and you'll be noting whether it's the first pass or the second pass and your name is the person who did that particular pass and that will happen soon i'll let you know so do we just open the file as we open the files for the first part yeah yeah you'll have to i would suggest creating a folder um called files to be checked or something like that in your high room yeah and then within that create a create sub folders with the micare given yeah and you'll have to get all the sound files unfortunately from the mm-m server on your own because the the ami servers not very reliable for getting these sound files uncorrupted so you'll have to get all the sound files from the mmm server and the person's transcription file should be in that folder where you're putting yours and then you'll just uh yet you'll copy that over you won't don't move it over because we're gonna have multiple versions of these things but yeah copy it into your directory and keep the same name and then when you check it in it will automatically be registered even though the the first pass was checked in when we're doing this checking in business um it will know like which pass it is but i think you'll also be indicating that as well uh it's safely connected questions um you'll know um originally the like when the first flight replied say yes we have seen did it said six weeks and the contracts say eighth of nay which is longer in advance than which is a great amount of time in six weeks yeah it's actually six what is it is it three months i think i've got a three months contract yeah the three month contracts and now if you can't keep that that's fine but okay it's just a logistic thing with personnel where we had that was the minimum we were able to offer a contract for so if you have to let us know as soon as you know when you're gonna get into holidays and yeah yeah obviously those

be more flexible with that hours if we want to i should think so i mean the whole point of keeping well as long as you're able to you know work out use of your computer with the other person that's

that hope you sort that out but also if if pays a matter um like if it's a matter that you haven't gotten paid for some reason um i hope that's not yeah i haven't gotten paid for so weeks because um i only have a three month contract started February but i started in a January talk to Canada yeah because i really don't know why that would be i'm here full-time now so i'll be here monday-fiday and i i leave at four now so won't find me in the time after that but your husband now i stayed at home to have yeah what assumes this he's uh four and a half once that's the question i was just going to ask is he so yeah well um only as of friday actually wow i was just telling Melissa this do you want us to stop yeah yeah oh good that worked out well oh do we have to take on that thing again oh yeah
