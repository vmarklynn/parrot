 Okay. See. On the mark. Okay. Okay. You guys actually had sort of interaction, or, or discussions while you were doing the annotation that you have stages of clarification or, I suppose you did, right? We did a training set to really compare to three. We did two of those. We did two training sets and then we had at least one meeting with you where we talked about this. Yeah. So did you feel there was some kind of, some process of convergence, like that initially had quite different ideas about the phrase types and, and, and, and then eventually you came up with some kind of rules that you set up between the two of you or. I don't know. Okay. I mean, I thought we had basically the same ideas. I don't remember ever having strong arguments about what should be and what group or. It was just the rules without thinking. Yeah. And what counted as, as, for the spectral features, it was more of a video. Yeah. I'm not sure. But I don't remember sort of arguing from the sides and converging just sort of. Heasing out what, yeah, come up and agreeing what we do. And we had a manual which we haven't got to. We can get a copy with that. That'd be useful. I don't have to leave the meeting now. It's been a long time since we've done this and we get Ben to. You're working Ben has seen. We did so. He has had it, certainly. Yeah. Yeah. He's been in the meanwhile. We got to the system and get it. Now he's gone. Yeah. There's a cool little count now as well. Let's know exactly how long you've been leaving. Excellent. Oh. We should have these things in our area. No, we don't have height. There's no height. We don't have height. Well, it's actually telescopes. Yeah. That's different than those things. They're hardly in our areas. They have good enough. Confidence thing, haven't they? In the ATC? Yeah. That's right. Although it isn't actually used all that often these days. I had to fly to Germany to the teleconference. In Germany. I'm so much easier for the ESO interview. Gosh. And they fly to Germany and put you on a four-way teleconference with me people in Chile. And had they asked, we could have done it to find that ATC. Right. And see, we're going to get to Germany today. Right. But it's enough. I haven't got that far. It's a very strange interview feeling as well because you can't see them. Any miss in the body language. Well, you're giving your talk because they just show, usually they have a camera on you and a camera on them. Right. But during the talk part, they have a camera on, I believe them. Because I could see that guy reading a newspaper halfway through my talk. And then they had a camera on showing what my slides were. Right. And I think it's a bit of a quick story. If you know that, you can talk about it. Yeah. So I was thinking that I'd be interested in this. And I thought, okay, that's the only way to get that they can see you at all. Right. So, when all of that was over, they were answering your questions and the view switched again. And I realized I was sitting there on the interview going. And mine was even, it was different again. It was a four-way split screen with me and three other people. And it just stayed like that. And I had the talk on the laptop in front of me. It's not easy towards the top left of the image. And luckily, I love you, it warned me, it might be complicated. And so I had something with, without very many, not how I was flying in and the things, because that was just really difficult. But I practice the talking, standing up in front of it and pointing to things. And you're sitting down in front of it. And you can see yourself, but not only do you see yourself bounce back two seconds later. But I tell you, it's a little bit gone to Chile at back. So you're like, well, can I just do that? And then you're reacting to what you did a while ago. That's a really daft situation. Great. Alright, we can start talking about, shall we dive in in the intro? Yes, yes. Continue on flux, we'll continue. Flux on its own wouldn't be a spectral feature. I think it should probably just be continuing. It was continuing luminosity, probably wouldn't. No, you wouldn't. I think I'm working out who's tapping bottom. Yeah, I'm happy enough with that. I actually haven't really thought about like marking on both marking who's tapping who's bottom. I think maybe that would make sense for you guys to know. I don't know. I think we've got to. I think we've got to. He left it out on purpose, which is recent. Yes. Yeah. I'm pretty sure I'm top. So, people are watching top. Because I would fight for lying being a spectral feature as well. Right. Yeah, I think that's probably right as well. It's hard to mark on this. Let's do that. Okay, next. So, sorry, I'm just for the convention. You're marking which annotation you think is the right one. Yeah. And if neither, then we'll have to put something else. Okay. So, here I'm missing a soft component on the body. I think that you're probably right. Soft component is a feature. If you get lying, I get soft component. Yeah. Do you think? Sorry. I shouldn't intervene, probably. Well, isn't it that if it's a region of the spectral that you can point at it, then it is a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a feature. And that isn't. You can point to a soft component. You think? Yeah. Okay. All right. It's a big bump in the soft bit. Okay. Okay. There is a feature, part of a spectral feature. I think you'll look there as well. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not asked about that. It's not just absorption. But it's not just absorption. It's actually something in absorption that you're seeing. If it was a, a different absorption for a lack of absorption, you would put it in. This is, this is, we said, we would put describing those. Yeah. That's a thing you point to, and this is a physical mechanism. So yeah, I'd say two down. We're going to do it. Excellent. That's two. That's definitely two. You're right. Ah, this one with the equivalent width. I think you're right there. We weren't going to mark the equivalent width, but we weren't going to mark the lines. I think that's true. Yeah. All right. Okay. Yeah. That's true. You get that. And nebulin. There's a source type. I don't remember what we were doing with nebulin. We weren't doing like H2 regions and stuff. I can't remember. Should we see when many will come, so it's come back to that one? Yes. I thought I'm probably doing that either. We're doing descriptions that made things separate classes. In which case I'd argue for a look to go to things. I'm just gone mad with the other line in here. Yes. Yeah. Breaking the power law index. I think that's probably a... You can point to it. Yeah. I think that you wouldn't know it was a... It's something you've derived. The power law index is something you've derived. A break in a spectrum is something you can point at. So what's up to making a power law index? I don't know. That's a feature. Because in this perspective it does that and it does that. Yeah. That thing there. Yeah. That is where it breaks. It's light to depression if you continue near the line limit. I think you were right. And if I did it again, I'd say slight depression at the continuum, and possibly... Well, you could say both the slight depression and the line limit, but we're supposed to say the descriptive words of the features. Yeah. If it was absorption at H alpha, that would all be one. Or absorption at 5000 nanometers would all be one anyway. Yeah. But they would be the same at a certain point. They'd both be the same spectral feature. Whereas here there's two near. Well, this is near. There's a line limit which you can see, and then there's a slight depression near it. Yeah. I think you're right. It's near rather than at. It's not near. Did you? It's not that. Do you have a sense about that? Oh, you want to split that one into two? Yeah. Yeah. I'd agree with that, I think. Is that clear? Excellent. It's good. Yeah. Okay. Absorption. That I didn't mark because... Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Absorption. That I didn't mark because... It's the physical process of absorption. Yes. Not the... Anyway, as well. The thing. I think it was more of an awakeness. Would there be other cases where you would actually mark absorption? Yeah. If it was... There's an absorption feature or absorption. You see it in the spectrum at this wavelength. Mm-hmm. But when you say, for example, the quasar is absorbed. That just means the quasar is behind a bunch of stuff. Cheers. Thanks. So that's describing something physically rather than describing the spectrum itself. Mm-hmm. Okay. Thank you. There is no steep self-compassionate but a 2K. I don't remember what we were going to do about things that weren't there. It's not something that's important to... You could point to it if it were there. Yes, you could. I tend to miss out on things if they're too long. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. But if it had been there, you would have... You would have marked... Yeah....had it as a feature. Yeah. Yeah. If you go back to number five. Is that the nebula? Was it the nebula? Yeah. Yeah. We're saying about labia? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The nebula counts, doesn't it? I think it does. Right. You weren't matching H2 regions because it was a region. I think it was the... Yeah. I think it was the start for that. Line again. Line with that line ratios. I don't know if we were going to mark line ratios, but we were going to mark equilibrium here, where you've got equipment of HP, too. Or if it's... But......ratios different. Line and... In line and line ratios is modifying ratios. ratios that is not talking about specific lines, a line ratios a thing. Yeah, because I would actually list it explicitly on that you're not going to include. Right. Don't include? Line ratios after abundances. Is that the value or the word? Oh, I see what you mean. Yeah. You wouldn't include a property. You wouldn't include abundances or line strengths. No. Yeah. You wouldn't include line in that. Okay. I don't think. Oh, oh, I see what you're doing. You're circling the one you like. The one you like. Don't climb an alpha. Absorbers. I think that's a spectral feature even though it's... You wouldn't mark the source type. Oh, sorry. So can you just ask? Now you just aligned. Sorry. You circled the word in the other line, which didn't... Yes, because we don't want to underline. Right. Sorry. I see. Okay. Yeah. All right. So again, these are source types. I mean, it's not a source type, but it's also a... But down-plan and alpha absorbers are physical things, not spectral features. But you also absorb them by... You're observed from by their spectral feature. What are we doing for things... The board absorption line, Crazor, for example. We were marking the board absorption line as well as board absorption line, Crazor. So I think it should be the same as that. If it's defined by a spectral feature, we should mark it. But... You wouldn't be able to point to something in a spectrum and say that's a damp line in alpha absorber unless you... You could point to damp line in alpha though. Because it says... Yeah, spectral features within are referring to a type of source, e.g. Balen, Palquasar. But we wouldn't say absorbers were a type of source. Um, not a specific type of source, but I think still the spectral feature counts even though it's a modifier or something. Okay. I'm not certain about that, but I... What do you reckon about me? Um... Well, I mean, you look at this spectrum in spots that... The line of alpha has been damped. But... That is a spectral feature. Don't... with damp line in alpha absorbers, you see them in a variety of places along the line of sight. So you have to know... Oh, yeah, no, that's true. How does it work? I don't know what... I'm not planning on asking for this. If you look at Aquasar and you see a bunch of... If you go to a bunch of clouds of gas in the way, you can see these things. Um... But you wouldn't be able to point at one of them and say, Ah, that's that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're gonna be different redshifts. But that doesn't mean that it's... You can still say, that's damp line in alpha, and that's damp line in alpha. I don't know how they do that. Yeah, but they say all of that is damp line in alpha. But you're guessing in a way, though, aren't you? Yeah. So... But isn't that always against something that's not particularly... Wouldn't they, but you see them in all sorts of different redshifts. It's like the, the line in alpha forest, sort of. And I'm not certain I would... I would mark that. Hmm, that's a... That's pretty one. That's certainly... If it was... If it was some other spectral feature, then absorb it. It would be my... No, I wouldn't, because it's... Their physical thing is not spectral features. You can't point at something on a spectrum and say, that's definitely a damp line in alpha. And I guess it's because they're modifiers of this source type, and we wouldn't mark that source type. But we include modifiers of source type. We wouldn't mark that source type. We wouldn't mark that source type. But if it was a damp line in alpha quasar, then we would mark quasar, and we would mark damp line in alpha. Right, well... Yeah, it would be like a Yeah, it would be like a It would mark it. In the manual. Yeah. So it's just, I guess, where the damp line in alpha is a spectral feature in itself. Which I would put against tricky one. Say it was, but then I've never looked at it. I guess it is. Okay. And then it is altering the spectrum, isn't it? I mean, it's changing this spectrum of background objects. It doesn't have to be something that's specific. I guess we say a big blue bomb or a soft or a continuum, and we include those. But we weren't going to include descriptions of spectral features that were based on fitting. That's true. We have included power law, though. Have we? No, we included steep soft components, sorry. And here we included breaking the power law. Because of the break. Steep soft component. Yeah, breaking the power law is something I'm not certain of. Steep soft component is something you can point at in a spectrum at same. There it is. There's still some to be a fitting in the notes. Yeah. Yeah. You know what's steep and what's shallow? It's tricky. Let's have that for now. If we change our mind later when we go through, we can always come back to it and say. Again, I'd say this is a physical process. Yeah. I'm sorry. And absorption again. Yeah. I don't have K-star, but I should do. Yeah. And this one here. We were including feature within spectral feature. Okay. What's wrong with Broadway, Jalfa? I think I just missed it. Right. It's not as if it's a... Although it's called itself maximum, it's still the line within it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It's a little bit more easy. Silicon II is an element rather than the... In this context. Rather than the line. These are the lines. I guess what you... If Maya there wasn't in there, then you'd have it Silicon II lines at... Yeah. And you're Silicon II derived from these two features. Yeah. I think it's here too. That's actually an ionic species. Yeah. That's actually an answer. Yeah. A spectral feature. I don't say. Yeah. That's true. And I'm in alpha-porus clouds. Oh no! We're back to it again. I'm in alpha-porus. You can point to one spectrum. That's true. But line in alpha-porus clouds are source types we aren't marking. So we haven't... We just haven't got a rule for spectral features within a thing, just types of source. We don't know about the marking source. Yeah. But we're just speaking system. We're marking H2 and H2 regions, for example. And I don't think we are. Because that's not a spectral feature. Yeah, but I guess it's not defined by a spectral feature. Yeah. And then we have a question where is......lamin alpha-porus is defined by... The definition of lamin alpha-porus clouds is that we have lamin alpha-porus. But saying that isn't the same as saying we've seen that in the spectrum. Whereas a broad line, quasar, someone has looked at it and they've seen a broad line. But if you're discussing lamin alpha-porus clouds, they could just be discussing the physical object, which we aren't marking. Why aren't you marking it then? Because they weren't... I don't know. I don't think we were mapping the blobs. Anything to keep. I didn't diffuse emission. Uh-huh. It wouldn't count as a source type. Well, that's what I'm... Yeah....wondering, really. I remembered not marking nebula or clouds. Yeah, but this is......dispond's species cloud. It's a......and particular species of cloud, not just a general cloud, isn't it? So... Isn't that different? It's a modifier of clouds, but I don't think we're including the... Yeah. I think we're not including......we can't include......if above saying maybe we should be including nebula in clouds. Perhaps we should have done......but we haven't done the whole thing. Okay. So I think maybe we just need to put... I guess not....and we don't include... Yeah....diffuse emission. But then we still have to decide if we don't enable the source, what do we do about the spectral features that define that source? If we have, for example, board absorption line object, we mark that. We mark board absorption line in that. That's because we've... I know it's a rather blub absorption line object, we have seen it. But to know this is a liminal for post cloud, we've seen liminal for post. But it's in the spectrum of another object, though. It isn't the spectrum of the... But it's still a spectral feature, and if it's not......it might be a spectral feature, not in the cloud, but it's a spectral feature in the quasar. That is true. That is true. And it could point at it, that's true, and say, that is... Let's keep up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Not that. It's not supposed to be better. Yeah. Okay, so......liminal for post again. Yeah. And that definitely is a spectral feature on its own, though. Because it doesn't fit in the post cloud. Yeah. Each helium-2 optical depth, I think that's an element. Yeah. Yeah, that's derived. All right. Oh. Oh, we might have the same lines. Excellent. What have we done differently? You've got line brightness temperatures. It's a do-eye property for line. We're gonna have a lot of these. Yeah, we are. And we weren't using line... What's one we didn't do before? Line ratio we weren't doing. I don't think line brightness temperatures counts. Because it's not talking about a specific line. Yeah. So, but......limbs. Okay. I don't think that counts. Line feature? Yeah. All right. Um, I'm sorry, can we just go back to one page? Did you resolve the different segmentations? Like, the main problem was... There's only one difference here. Oh, sorry. I thought it was a problem of like, one having underlined the entire... Oh, sorry. No, no. Okay. Sorry, guys. Quite implicitly. Yeah. That's it. That one's a spin. Damp line and alpha again. Systems. And... And then......liminal the data. That's a modifier of data. I can't believe it. But if you said... I mean, that's... If you said the spectral data......type of data. The continuum spectrum. Mm-hmm. I really don't think that counts. But if you said damp line and alpha spectrum, you'd mark damp line and alpha. Because it's in the spectrum and a data......because it was a equivalent spectrum. I think......just because it's got a spectral feature in the phrase......you wouldn't, for example, when we were saying silicon two levels, we didn't mark silicon two. That's because it was a spectrum. I can't believe it's saying silicon two line. But what this actually means is we've made some measurements......based on damp line and alpha measurements......and they tell us this answer. And this answer is... I think it's probably right in the case of it being data. Yeah, I don't think that's right. I'm not sure, actually. I think I would mark it. It is a region of the spectrum and they are actually using a region of the spectrum......as the data. If it's an emission line, there's... But if you both want not to mark it, then find it. Don't mark it. If it's an emission line data, we put it in. I wouldn't. But if it's just said emission line, we would. The emission line is strong. The emission line data shows strong. Then I think it's the same, actually. I think it's......data isn't even needed. It's inconsistent with the damp line and alpha at more than......and I've never seen it. Or we're damped enough for feature. You put feature there rather than data within your market. Oh, feature, absolutely. But I think data is equivalent. I think that it's equivalent. From the perspective of the name the entity recognition task, there was also this one guideline of saying, for example, if something is sitting under a negation, there was no damped L, Y, L for something. Then I think the convention was that you still would mark that. It's more like a quite literal task. It's really finding these types of strings rather than really referring to the underlying......physical reality. If you were to resolve these kind of cases in order to put them in a database......so then you'd probably be right in this case. But given that the kind of thing is that there's named anti-directing......t...it should be......damped L, Y, L for......in red, whatever that is, spec or feature. And that should be there at all. Okay. It's got a good hand back then it twice. Is that clear enough? A sort of type......if we have a rule about this. We were including modifiers, including borderline craze-lars, non-boardline craze-lars as well. So I think we should probably......the flat spec from the video quiz is very different. That's true. It keeps spec from......10% of the way there. No, I think we can have something. Just hitting the half an hour mark. Continuous. Speed up. It'll be a bit better. Monthly software, nice and continuous. You like that, I think? See, that's talking about the flux of ionizing photons rather than the absorbent continuum of that spectrum. Yes, I don't like that one. Oxygen, sugar, and that's not a good tip. Here's the element absorption modes. I think you should be there. I'm happy enough with that. What else is different? Blue shifted. That's okay with being okay. Yeah, I can have that as well. There we go. Let's... You write stuff on the galaxy, so......distinct. Okay. I don't know why I did that one. Yeah, I don't like that at all. Probably because you were doing 7,000 degrees. Yeah, I couldn't even get that. Lines from ions? You can't tell the difference between a line from an ion or something else. Not... Well, you know where they are in the... I guess... If it was lines from an H2... Yeah, that's true. That's true. Alright. Blue wing flux. What are we going to do about flux? Does it say? The feature itself is blue wing flux, or if it was a blue wing feature, with marked feature. Yes, it's the amount of stuff in the blue wing. Yeah. Line peak. I think that should be marked, even though it's to a increasing line peak. It's also to a increasing excess blue wing. Mmm. Do you actually need excess blue wing flux? That's true. I think line peak is a piece of... Do you can point? Sure, but can you point to a line peak velocity shift? Yeah, I don't think you can. You can't also point to increasing blue wing. We can point to blue wing flux because you have your line and there's the blue wing flux. But if a line peak is increasingly shifted... Yeah, I don't think that's the feature. Okay. There's a system issue again, so we should be consistent. Thank you, but... Right. Yes. Thank you. Right. Nuclear hydrogen, you've got an petite. I think all of us suspect that feature. It's basically a way of saying the gunpeters... It's a way of saying the gunpeters in 12th, though. Which, if you just said that... Well... It's gunpeters in absorption. It's not a process. Rather than... If it was hydrogen absorption, it marked the whole thing. There's hydrogen in the line you would, so you should mark it as... Or H-B2 absorption. It's a... Marks that kind of expect the feature, doesn't it? It's a process, isn't it? But since H-B2 absorption is a process from H-B2, but it's still... This is a process from nuclear hydrogen. I guess what I mean is nuclear hydrogen should be in there. And the fact that gunpeters in comes between it... It's just a pain. Well... I wouldn't have any of it, I think. I think all of that is just that it's a script of a process. Isn't it? I think I might agree with H-B2. Because this definitely shouldn't be marked. Because that is a process now. Yeah. And if that shouldn't be marked, then that shouldn't be marked. Okay. Let's just cross off the mat. What? Oh, blueshifts of absorption. And you get a modify of the thing I'm saying I probably should be there. Okay. As an we think we can... Yeah....song absorption we can. I think we should ditch it. Um... Let's talk about the lion, isn't it? So that should be it. Yes. Okay. Do you think? Yeah. Yeah, let's talk about that. And to strength, yeah. It's not the abundance of it or any derive property. It's just the strength of the lion's. You don't think that it actually is abundance really in a way? I'm not sure, but... I guess perhaps it is. I'm not sure. Yeah, I'm not sure. Um... Let's make it a decision. Um... I guess it could be a bit of a note. Well, yes. Either that......if that shouldn't be and neither should either of those. Yes, it's true. I think it probably should then. Yeah. Because we will put narrow line strength. If it's a different......I'd be too lying strength. We'll definitely put it here. Yeah, that's right. And I think that's what it's referring to even though it's not......is not saying... Well, but it......isn't it's an elemental abundance that you estimate actually using a number of lines. It isn't just one discrete line in the spectrum, is it? If it's a line......worth you to... It's an abundance. It's an element, I guess. But it's......who is an ionic species and it'll have a number of......lines in the spectrum when you're......estimating. And the abundance of the......spishy that she's using all the lines. Uh......but it says strength rather than abundance. I think that's still looking at the amount of flux coming out of all the F and Q lines rather than......with marked things. Um... Yeah, I don't know if we've marked things like......so it can't be one throughout. In general, we haven't... I mean, it's specifically saying it's a line. Yeah. But I guess the question is, does this specifically refer to a line? Maybe it's not clear enough to......well......that's not marked. Yeah, if we don't mark it though, we definitely shouldn't mark these two. Well, if that's line, now a line. If it says it's F.E.2 line strength, then we would mark it. Can you talk about the line a bit rather than the element? Do you agree with that? I think so. If that's true, then they're leaving out the word line. I don't think it should mean that it shouldn't be marked. The word line should be in there. Or... We know what they mean. Right? Yeah. I think they mean......I think they mean the line strength rather than the F.E.2 abundance. Okay. Well, then have it in. That's what the full period......next. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Blotestar. That's it. Is that what that means? Okay. Okay. Um......take out my......and that's just the one. Oh. That's just the one colour. This is......that......your light. I think you're right there. That counts. Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Any other lens one? Okay. Back up. Yes. That was when I wasn't sure about it because I didn't do phone for it. Yeah. Midden for......if it was......you lurks, you put it in. That's......just the one that......this......is just......this should be a source name....shouldn't be......should. I don't know......does those count as modifiers active? We definitely include active. Yes. I guess the problem is G2. What does that mean? I've assumed it kind of elliptical. E2 is hyper elliptical. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I don't know what the gene means. Okay. Is this one I just think I would......if it was a cataloo. Mmm. Mmm. I think Shippen......those can......does that not mean a......a broadband detection? And does that count? Sorry. Mostly. A...H alpha detection. Yeah, you're still detecting the line. You think you're detecting it from broadband? I thought it's......but don't we say we don't do that? Um......I would write, look. Don't include modifiers of regions or systems. E.G....ward line region. You are right, systems. That's why I wasn't doing it. And now a line, nebuling. Okay, we just get back to change this. You're right. Okay. Where were it started here? Um... Why did it......to do that? We have got an heavily marked here. Yeah, but modifiers of regions or systems is the......to be an if you see one. Yeah, we could always change this if we think we're right, rather than going back through it. So, damp, lime and alpha absorbers shouldn't be in there. Based on this, but we could change this rule rather than changing all those things. But then... I may... I probably use that rule half the time and just forgotten to use it at the times. Um... just about changing rules. I mean, in a sense, you also want to make sure that the......the agreement that you arrive on today that they are consistent with what you have to be formed, right? So, I mean, this really only displays those cases where you disagreed. Right. But if you sort of like change a rule now on the flight, then that might be......that might create inconsistencies. You might have followed that. Yeah, so I'm sure I followed that rule sometimes and just forgotten. So, let's take that out. Um......and......and alpha-phones to you? Yeah. But lime and alpha-phones should be in here because it's not talking about......it's not modified. Yeah, that's fine. Damp, lime and alpha systems. Oh, alpha data. Oh, alpha data. Data, I think we should keep it. Okay. Because it's......would be the same as future. I... I think data is the same as spectrum, because the data is a spectrum. Yeah. I still don't like it, but... Final view book, I don't have passion. I wouldn't, I think, now, probably. I'll just do ours. And this one comes out as well. Okay, so we want......just props. No, that's......yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Oops. We're there. All right. So what were we looking at this page for anyway? H.L. for detection. Broadband detections, isn't......don't include. But I wouldn't... Well, H.L. for the line, maybe, isn't it? Whether it's only a narrowband detection. Yeah. A narrowband imaging detection. All right. Good. I think so. H.L. for emitters are not a distinct class of source. No, they're not. Line? Just out of curiosity, this narrow and broadband that refers to the type of spectrogram that you have, like, on the type of filter, or is it... Yeah. Exactly. Yeah, exactly that. But I guess if you're picking out a spectral feature with a broadband......or not a bad moment, still respect the feature. If you're picking out a line, yeah. Or you pick it out. It's definitely way back over. Line on its own. It's going to be a lot of those. Okay. Right. This is another system, so... Yeah. Absorption profiles. I think the whole thing should actually be marked. Even with complex. How fast should we go? Just absorption profiles. Yeah, absorption profiles are different. Yeah. And......laminar for post-lamin, blanketing or laminar for post-lamin. Yeah, take out the blank. What's this? Ah, that's... Is it a system? Ee, yep. Do you have the eye as an instrument? Oh, is it? Now, VRBI is a network. What is it? VRBI is interferometer. It's a technique. Yes. The network is an instrument, no? The instrument. What's... It's called something else. It's called an array. It's an array. It's an array on the end. It would be the......histimate. This is... Well......the LBI network image. So, do they mean the VLBA? It's an all of......this is an instrument, if you have it all, isn't it? European VLBA. It's an instrument, not a research group. Yes, it takes an image. Oh, but they don't......research, for a second. Okay, that's... How much of a modifier is we putting in? It's only supposed to be proper names. But I don't... Which it is. Yeah, it's that. So, this whole thing is an instrument. From 1.6 or... That's what I think. European. Oh, I think it is......or just from the LBI. Starting with......Europe......here, I think. Yeah, I think. Oh, I say, say, yeah. So, is this like, it's a subset of the VLBA? Er... Yes. Yeah, I know. Just in Europe, right? But it's actually Merlin and all the international analogues in Europe. All hooked up into one instrument, basically. Okay. All right. That is a source name. Right. That's just board banders and that's board animation. Yeah, that's just......and that shouldn't be marked. Radio loud objects. It's not a......it's not a......body......it's not an......you know, system. We say something about objects and I think it's that we don't. Is it? Anything any object we don't need to get here. Yeah. So, none of those. Hmm. Now, we've both marked nine ratios here. Yeah, but we shouldn't have done. That's the same set. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's sort of......it's certainly not a source name. And though it's different because it shouldn't let me ionize and continue. Yeah, that means... Which is it? That's a process. It's a process or it's the type of photons that's not looking to be relooking at. Maybe even going to land pose. Truth. Yeah. That shouldn't be. Hmm. You're going to show that. Yeah. So, glowing. You're right there. That's all. One big, speckful feature. And nebula shouldn't be marked. Have we agreed on that? We only agreed that... So far, we've only agreed that we can't include spectral features modifying nebula. But I don't see yet where it's written down that you can't mark. We did mark nebula. Yes. It was things that weren't distinct, like... Yeah, but there's so many different kinds of nebula, I think, as well as I wasn't doing it. Yeah, it's a difficult one. I'm going to stick to it. Let's take it. We're going to happen. That's what happened. Oh, yeah. Don't mind. Stop being there in your kitchen. I'm going to do that. You're right. So, that's sort of... Line blanketing. I know. We had line blanketing just now. We included it. Did you? I thought it was a process, and it wasn't included. What was it? We did just have it. Yeah. It was not for that. It wasn't for that. It was like a lime and forest line blanketing out. Yeah, we took line blanketing out. Yeah. I don't think that should be. Yeah. That's what happened. Yeah. That's a source. Maybe? Yes. Yes, it is. Red and blue components. I think you're right there as well. Yeah. You could say. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. In the same way that you can point to soft x-rays or the hard x-rays. You can point to the red and the... Well, I would argue about that, you see, because I think that you only extract that half to actually modulus perspective. Thank you. The soft access you can definitely point to on an x-ray thing. But there's one there or not. Yeah. You're saying you wouldn't know it was soft. Oh, components, though, is such. Oh, yeah. We're talking about the continuum. If you have a dialect spectrum, you can say there's the blue component, there's the red component to this. Yeah. Oh, so you mean it comes from adding two different things together? Yeah. That's what I'm thinking about. I can see that. Yeah. It's actually, we don't... Because actually modulus is about to not just actually looking at this spectrum. Yes. Yeah. I give that for red and blue components, but I wouldn't probably give that for soft components. Because a soft access is a... I mean, that's an x-ray thing. Like a break, you say. Yeah. And if you said red or blue would be accessed rather than red or blue component. Yeah, but... I guess the... I would component it is... It means it's now that we're actually in a model, though. Yeah. It'd take out red and blue. Yes. Which means maybe we should take out soft. Well... It's such a basic sort of... you look at a spectrum and you say that's a soft access. It's a soft. The access is, yeah. But... If you modelled it with two parts, what... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hard and soft to spectrum. That's probably... Hupbled and houbled deep field south. Um... I don't know how to group some size. I didn't include it. Although it does apply to the concept. I think I would. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just keeping... So, did we have a soft component earlier? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And you remember when? No. I'll get you pretty early on, I'd have thought. It's not really beginning. There it is. Oh. Excellent. Um, I... Houbled. No. And then, top one, I think, you should include... Possibly with flux as well. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's fine, I'll have to... And then... Yes. Yeah. Okay. Oh. Yeah. Okay. Oh. I heard radio galaxies. No, we stay about... At Onims were part of it, was useful. Um... Do we have to make a decision about hyzerbrideogarics? Exactly. They are discussed as a separate source to our partner. Well, are they? Um, hyzerbrideogarics. Only just... Interesting because... On the outside. Yeah. Yeah. But I don't think you're right. Mark, I... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What did we say about Aquanims were part of it's useful. I think you're supposed to mark the whole thing. Yes, I think you are. Yeah. So you're right. Um... C-fit 1.8 and 1.9 galaxies. Is a subclassification of C-fit? No. I wouldn't say that would be a subclassification of C-fit. No, it would make us... You wouldn't say that would be a subclassification of C-fit. I don't think we'll do that, I think. It's......stupid. Yeah. I think they probably are. Yeah. Yeah. It's just... I'm not a bit too nice. You should like feature with an include. Yeah. Yeah. Galaxy Galaxy formation doesn't... Yeah. And... Yeah. And now this is one that counts. Well, it should be this one, but... But what if you don't... If these are doubly underlined? Has it just plotted the top color? Oh, was it actually possible to doubly underline things? Yes. Um... I don't know which one it would display then. Okay, because what we want... Yeah, let's just mark what we want and......not that, but with......also borderline. Yeah. I can't write. I should know that was possible to have this......so you allowed to come to bed at... Yeah....latations, right, okay. Because quite often an object class is defined by a spectral feature. Mm-hmm. Okay. Like borderline radio galaxies. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Border lines. Yeah. I don't think that should go in. Just the wrong......mode. Okay....color for a few things. Oh, it's over here. Hyperluminous galaxy. If you're having ultra-luminous... Yeah. Mm-hmm....then you have to have hyperluminous here. This is just a color issue. Is it a... Oh, right. And QSO is not... Yeah. You're right. Yeah. I should have written......that one. Yeah. ISM. Stupis. It's probably shouldn't be in there. The ISM isn't a source type. Is it? No. I don't think so. BINTER CH made it. Yeah. Umm... Yeah. Correct. Let it, let it, let it it go. a modified object. Oh no we're doing that either. The question is are emission line objects a separate class of source? I think they are. But are you arguing not to have anything with object in it? Yeah. Yes you might. And super galaxies should be one. Yes. You've got 270. It's pretty good. It's still your third. And you speed it up as well I think.
