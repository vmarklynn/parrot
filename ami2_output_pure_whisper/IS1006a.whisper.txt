 So, hello everyone. We here to have a tick of meeting for the beginning of a new project, remote control for the design for a new remote control. I'm the project manager, Christa Pavlov. And let's begin. So I'm first going to do an opening, then we get used to one another's and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan, some discussion and then we took the next meeting. So we want to do a new remote control. It has to be original, trendy and user friendly. I think the important points we have to talk about are its functional design, its conceptual design and detailed design, and for that we are going all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day. So let's try this by a word. So any of you want to go? Yeah, for favorite animals. It's going to be not my favorite one but the one I can draw. And it's going to be, you'll try to guess. Wow. Complex. A cat. No. A rabbit. Yes, that's a rabbit. A what? That's my favorite one. A rabbit. A rabbit. Oh, yeah. Where's the carrot? That's it. Beautiful. I'm not very good at this kind of stuff. My favorite animal is... Wow. Human. Yes. A human, yay. It's a very complex animal. No. And yeah, characteristics of this animal is dangerous. I think you're supposed to, yeah. I guess you can. Wow. That's cobra. Kind of snake. Cobra. Exactly. Yeah. Not really. Small cobra. No, just small cobra here. Is that a worm? Of course, recognizable. What about you? Yeah. Christa. Christa. A fish. Smiling fish. Smiling fish. Mm-hmm. Okay. My body is working. Next. Next. Just try to ask who is a user interface designer. Yeah. Well, I didn't do drawings. Not me. Yeah, you're okay. So. So. 25 euro for remote control. Yeah. That's the price we want to... That's the aim for the price for the remote control. We aim to do this profit. No. This big number. International market. Yeah. We have to sell 2 million. Wow. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. For a production cost of 12.50 euro maximum. Okay. So, any of you have experience in remote controls? Oh, yes. We have plenty at home. In fact, my daughter likes very well remote controls. We eat, yeah? Mainly. And to break. So, that would be a great application. Remote controls, children proof. Yeah. Children proof. Yeah. So, she likes buttons. Okay. Which make click. So. It has to click. So, they have to be waterproof. It has to be waterproof. Because they... Dibby proof. She. Yeah. But mainly it has to be very robust because even if she's not very tall, she's high enough so that when she trade away, it's... No. So, it has to be very robust. Okay. Unbreakable. Unbreakable. Yeah. We have some childy look or something. Yeah. Mm-hmm. It has to be nice looking colorful. Colorful? Colorful. That's not practical. Because nobody has colorful. No. It's always black. Yeah. No. This one could be, I don't know, purple. But how gonna... Okay. Just... But it's monochrome. It's not like... Yeah. No. Because you think... One color. I don't know if you will now find it. Yeah. Yeah. Like the phones and these things. It could change colors. Yeah. At least for children like one color. Yeah. Good. Good idea. And it should be really small. Small also, don't you think? Not so big like... No. Not too much buttons or... Yeah. Not too much buttons. Should it be... You know these remote controls where they are what they call universal remote controls? So you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television. Then it's the remote control for the sound system or for your refrigerator. Whatever. Yeah. I don't know if it's... Or if we should have targeted with remote control. Okay. So... Color, roundness. Easy to use. Size. Yeah. Size matters. Yeah. Color, size. It's better, small than bigger. Yeah. Maybe at least. Not bigger than this. Yeah. Without any extremes like not of this size. No, not too small. Yeah. At least it should hold you know hand properly like with... Yeah. Like a pound size. Yeah. And just to hold it. Okay. But what would be different from this from the others? I don't know if... Yeah, mainly we can change the colors. At least the frame. Yeah, at least the color. So then it depends. You have to... I mean you can easily remove the... I think one thing important for instance in this remote control is if you remember when people use it, they never find a good button at the right place. Yeah. For some reason they click the off button when they want to use the... Yeah. So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow. So some kind of idea with a similar phone with a screen that will tell you what... No, no screens. It's too complex. Okay. Too expensive for 12 years. Too expensive. Maybe not too expensive. Well it's not my point but... Yeah. Okay. But no screens on remote controls. I thought it could be only a screen. Which would change depending on the user or even the user. So I prefer to have the off button at the top right. So I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a full touch screen remote control if you like. I mean I don't know if it makes sense. It's like two types. You know people are right-handed or left-handed. So because I'm left-handed I use like this. So if you're right-handed you use like this. So your switch on rock should be... So adaptable. Yeah. That'd be it. If it's possible. Yeah. So how many actions do we need to implement in it? Maybe even we can keep two features and then we can only make one working. We can adapt only once. Which suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left under I use the switch to four. I mean if it's less than three years then we can make it like two. Three buttons? I mean like three mental states. Oh. You know what I mean. You can just make it controlled by your brain. Yeah. Sure. Maybe it's more. There is a software inside that asks you three... If we want a universal remote control that we say... Like we say before it may need more than three buttons. Three. Yeah. More than three actions that you may want to do at a given time. But for standard actions you usually want to change channels. You adjust volume and nothing else. Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have... You can just go to the next one or go to channel 25. And that's already more complex to go to channel 25. You do this? No. I just change channels. Because I'm only using three or four channels. But they keep generally the slash slash this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put... Yeah. You can only have one bit... I can channel like this. I want to go to 25 and then... And then back to the one I was before. Also you can... Go back button. Go back button. We had that. Yeah. The previous button is... Yeah. Even the history. So you could like undo it. Oh. Oh. The previous of the previous. Then you can watch what your other... You could also record your... Record your sequence of actions that becomes more complex. You could look at what the other people have used. Yeah. What the... Which channels do you... Maybe it's... Okay. So I think we have full idea. And we're going to meet again in 30 minutes. And I want you to work on these ideas and try to make a... Do ones make a... To decide what... What are the ones important and the ones that we don't want. And maybe more in the technical parts. What do we want to do? So your personal coach will send you some instruction for... For these 30 minutes. So what does ME means? ME, the user requirement. That's for us. Market expert. Oh, that's me. Of course. Yeah. The user requirement specifications. Yeah. Okay. Think of that. So... I think that's all. Meeting's over? Great. Okay. Thank you. See you in 30 minutes. Thank you.
