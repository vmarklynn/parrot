 Hi. Hello. Hi. Good morning. Good morning. Before I start with the meeting, I have a few things to tell you about the setting we're in, because we're being watched by a big brother. By a big brother? This is our camera, so are these. This thing that looks like a pie are actually all microphones. Okay. So you must be careful with all this. And as I can see, you have placed your laptops exactly on the place where it must be. And that has to do with the camera setting, so we don't have our laptops in front of the cameras. Of our faces. And indeed, so they can see our faces. Okay. Welcome at the kickoff meeting. My name is Daniel Wolf. This is the agenda for today. First, a little opening. I will introduce myself. I think it's very good to introduce yourself. Then a little bit of acquaintance, acquaintance to ourselves, so we get to know each other. That will be done with tool training from these two smart boards. Then the project plan, what we're going to do and how we're going to do it. And discussion about that and a little closing at the end. Okay. My name is Daniel Wolf. I'm the project manager. What's your name? I'm Aaron Tops. I'm the user interface designer. User interface, okay. Hi, my name is Aaron Forfura. I'm the industrial designer. I'm Tim Fannie. My function is a marketing expert. Okay. Thank you. First, a little about the project. The aim is to make a new remote control. Maybe you have read the website. It's a very ambitious company. They want to do something else. There must be a new remote control. First of all, it must be original and trendy. It's two things really close to each other. But at the same time, user friendly. They have, yeah, that's very important for them. There are three stages. There's functional design. So what are we going to do? What are we going to make kind of functions in the remote? And why are we going to do it? Then the conceptual design. How are we going to do it? And that's really global. Because at the detailed design, how part two, we go to dig in really about how the technical, if it's possible technical wise. Each stage is broken up in two stages. Individual work and a meeting. So it's very straightforward. Okay, the tool training. We have two smart boards. This one is for the presentations. The PowerPoint presentations or the word presentation, or whatever you had. And this is only for drawing. So we must let it stand on this program. This is called Smart Board Thing. It speaks for itself. And as you may have heard, the documents in the shared folder can be showed on the screen. Not in the My Chocolate. So if you want to show something, put it in the shared folder. This is very straightforward with the save to print the undo, the blank, the select pen. Well, I don't explain it all because I think, you know, how it works. We must not forget everything we draw on here. Almost be safe. We may not delete anything. So if you have dropped something, save it. Never delete it. That's very important. Okay. A little kind of exercise to know each other at the white board on the left. Every one of us must draw our favorite animal and tell us why we had chosen that animal. Important is that we use different colors and different pen widths. Why? I have a question. This exercise, did the company board tell you to do it? Did you just make it up? No, no, no. It's part of the internet. We really don't know each other. Getting used to each other, we can have a little fun. Before we dig in, really do the hard stuff. Would you start withdrawing your favorite? I don't know really how it works. Maybe you can show us first. Yeah, okay. Drawing goes with this thing. Do not touch your hand on this little thing here. That's important. All it's like this. You get electrocuted? Yeah, kind of. So, you must push a little good. And wait a few seconds. It's not fully real time. Watch it. I'm going to paint in red. Oh, that's the background color. Wow, Andrew. Depant? One minute, please. Yeah, that's the one. Five. Okay. My favorite animal. You can guess what it is. The one who says it first gets erased. May I paint next? It's a fork? No, it's not an arc. I have it at home. You have an arc at home. Very artistic. Thank you. So, it's a cat. What's it called? Sima. We have a cat at home and he's called Sima. They're the lion from the Lion King. It's kind of cool to name an astronaut lion. He's happy with us. He's smiling. He does have body. Now only the face. We have 25 minutes. We have to speed up. Remember you use different colors and different pen widths. We want to go next. Choose a color. You don't have to change the color. Save it. I've done that. Okay. You have to push hard on the pen. Not ready. That one. Okay. Open. Which one? Okay. I've got red. It's a fogg. It's a napple. It's a white color. Something like this. It's a turtle. It's a turtle. You watch it a lot. It's a character. It's coming out. Wow. Wow. You want to go next? How did it work? I had five. The big lines were like nine. It's a dog. I had a dog. I had a dog. I had a dog. I had a dog. I had a dog. I had a dog. I had a dog. I had a dog. I had a dog. I had a dog. I had a dog. I had a dog. I had a dog. I had a dog. I had a dog. I had a dog. I had a dog. I had a dog. I had a dog.
