 All right but how muchChanel? These are about point lightning. I'm going to take a little bit of water. I'm going to take a little bit of water. I'm going to take a little bit of water. Good morning everybody. Good morning. Good morning. We asked to make a new remote control for TV vision. The characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy. And of course user friendly. People can use it without any money from that. Well I think we should set the points to drive the project. Did you send us an email about this? Not yet. We received an email about this. The designs. Do you want me to send you a mail? It's okay. Or we can put it in the shared folder. You see the email? The email inside the email? No, I didn't get it. It's inside. This one? No. No. The third one. You didn't get anything? No. I'm a one getting. Strange. I got an email about the discussion. You get an email from me? I don't know from who. I can't manage. You received the same email. I think it's for you guys to design it and all the aspects. So you need that information. Yeah, I think so. Each of us has a role to do. I think we should assign your roles for each person. So there are three kinds of designs. Okay. Who will be the responsible of the functional design in the portfolio? I think our responsibilities will be assigned when we are made. We received from the account manager. I'm doing the interface. Are you using the? Yeah, I'm doing the interface. Well, maybe we have... Okay, so I did industrial design to the little confusion about my... But it's all right. Okay. You are 49D series design. Yeah. Okay. And you... Norman? I'm working on a user. Using interface. And... And... I'm into marketing. Right, doing the marketing. I mean, yeah, nothing much in the project. Nothing related here to here. Marketing in this design. The design is best calling for industrial design and the user interface. You see the second, man? Yeah, it's inside. Go down. Appendix. Yeah, this is all. This is a role for everybody. Yeah, that's right. The first was for the marketing. The third was user defined. You might look at your role, your marketing role. It was a trend watch. I don't know. Yeah, that's your role. Well, I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about design. Maybe we'll discuss his later. Well, we want to have a new remote control for TV distribution, I guess. So we have to plan how it would be developed and how we can make it work. Yes. I mean, working remotes, we already have a service, something different from the other remotes. Remote controls. I don't know. We have to keep in mind this characteristic. I don't think it should not be very costly. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Well, I think that Norman and I would think about the technical points and we should discuss it in the next meeting. We need to collect information about the boardwalk. About the design, perhaps. What is most important in remote control? What is the most important functional aspect? You mean the external aspect? Well, you have to make it work. That's the big thing. It should be easy to work with. Yeah. Yeah. We can think about an interface with the web. Maybe you can have a speech recognition interface. You just tell the television, which channel. Or you can say, for example, I want to list all the programs tonight. Instead of just remote control, it's doing the sum searching for you. You don't have to look for the channel. You want to say, maybe I just want to press. I want to have a button for all the movies tonight. Or a button for all the magazines, all the information, documentary tonight. And then you list a few and I will choose from the list. Instead of pressing the channel number, I'm choosing the programs directly. That's one way of making it useful. I think if you include a lot of technology on Terromode, you can do it very easily. It's not very a lot. This information exists. For example, you can get... Like you say, we can use speech. You can use... well, for example, anything. The idea of using speech to reduce the button. And it's more natural. I think if you wanted to choose from a list of programs or something like that, you may have to use... The main function of remote control is to have something in the hand. And we should be very careful about the size of the remote control. If you are going to add a speech interface, I'm not sure with the trendiest thing. The trendiest limit size of the remote control, it should be able to put a speech recognition system. I think the TV itself could have it. And I could talk to the TV television itself. I need not have any... You are far from the TV. We have some arrays or something. Different technology. The main idea I wanted to say is that there should be a function. Instead of choosing the TV channel, there's an option. You can choose either TV channels or... The content. Or the content of the program. It's a good idea, but I think that technically it would be a little bit more tricky to achieve this. Because you see, now all the TV programs are available on the web. They are available in the XML format. We don't care. We just said that there's some content. We just want to retrieve the content and then sort them by the types of programs. Sound the website. They already provide the service. So you can just use the service available. Download it to this remote control. And then there's the only six buttons for six categories. The most, the only seven buttons. So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button, for example, to choose among the sorted list, the programming one. So you don't have to choose among hundred channels. If you have hundred channels, you just have six buttons, seven buttons. Yeah, we should also optimize the number of... I think that just by using navigation buttons and user interface on the screen, we are able to navigate through the... Oh, yes. So you learn... The channel program or contents are in an easy way. Yeah. So you don't have to display here. You just display on the TV screen. Yeah. Good idea. You just put on the TV screen and just... Okay. With the remote control, we just navigate through the... I think that will be revolutionary. Because all the TV... the remote control will have all numbers, lots of buttons and then you don't know what to choose the end. Yeah. Yeah. So... All right. I think for the technical points, we have to check how to gather the data from program or contents and all these stuff. Okay. So we have five minutes to... We have sometimes to use the whiteboard. You can't use it. Five minutes. Another interesting idea for this would be to have a light adaptation system depending upon the picture. Okay. So, I mean, if you're watching a movie and suddenly there's a dark... Yeah. Some dark scene. The lights that have themselves. The lighting in the room changes. Yeah. But we are designing just remote control. I mean, you have an option in the remote control. If you want to have that option, you press that button in the remote. All right. Okay. Do you want to have a conceptual remote control there or you just want to put the function in... If you want to kind of use no more control. Go ahead and draw something. I'm afraid you'll go to put your lapel. Where is it? The lapel. Before the design, let's assume... Where is it? Yeah. Yeah. That one. This is the one. Yeah. This is what? Before writing, you can see that. Let's assume what we said. And after that you can use the one. Okay. All right. So the most important function is the buttons to choose the content. We agree on that, right? Okay. A first one is the... Buttons. Or it could be anything. Yeah. Put buttons to choose content. Or channels. So we have both the user can choose which one they want. Yeah. By content or by channel? By content or by channel. Choose by contents or by channels. So... And then what do we say just now? Other than this? And we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents. Okay. So technically, how the problems, how to do it, is to... How to get the content. Yeah. Challenge. I think it's not very difficult to browse by channel, but it's a little bit tricky to browse by content. Okay. Content. Okay. So this we have to work it out. So this is one of the problems. And... I think that's the main thing. The main thing. And to reflect about it. All right. Okay. So we'll discuss it in the next meeting. We'll get some information in the next meeting. So for now we get the... This is the functional designer spec guy. That's the first aspect. All right. We'll get information and then we'll come back in. Okay. Thank you everybody. Okay. So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes. All right. We'll meet discuss. All right. Okay. I'll go to aspects. Okay. Thank you. I'm not thinking I'll be coming. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
