 The Mommy Or I will go No sir. In the car. You Good morning. Good morning. Hmm. Well, I'm supposed to go home. I think it's supposed to be like this. Okay. That was good. Oh, no, I don't think it's actually......9 here. And you have to adjust the length. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I am done. Okay. So, we will wait for a few minutes. Yeah. Oh, he goes his weather. Well, he can put anywhere you want, actually. Yeah, but the mic is not... It's not a directional mic, anyway. It's a work like this. So, I will try to get my presentation, all right? Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Then press the......this, you know? Just try. Okay. Oh, this is not... I'll......f-a. But don't have to be around the screen here. I do it. Oh. Wow. Amazing. It's working. Okay. Thank you. I'll just flip it on the... Okay. So, good morning, everyone. Welcome at the kickoff meeting of our latest project. I hope you all have been updated about it. Yeah. Good. I'm going to do a little bit of a quick introduction. This meeting with an agenda as presented here. After the opening, we will get acquainted to each other. See what our roles are in this project. So... We have been provided with some technical tools to......communicate and to......well, learn from each other's plans, as I can say. So... We will also try to......to get acquainted to these tools. So, they are also new to me. I don't know whether you've worked with them before. Then we will come to the actual project plan. I hope it's about the new remote control we are going to. Going to the design. Then we will discuss......well, how it should be and......what our new project should look like. And then, after some 25 minutes, I hope we can end this meeting. So......basically, this is about a new remote control. When you design a new project, you of course want it to be original. We want to be distinguished. People want to look at the shelf. Well, that's the product I need. So, it needs to be trendy. I mean, trendy is what people want, so then they will buy our project. But then, it also should work user-friendly. And otherwise, people......well, it will not be rated very well in consumer articles, like that. So, the general outline of a new project will be......we first go through a functional design phase. You all get certain tasks in this phase. And then we will meet again and discuss this functional design. And the same holds for the two phases. After this, the conceptual design. And after that, a more detailed design in which the final project should get......is definitely the shape. But first, we will do some two frames. In all in front of you, you see the notebooks and not blocks. And we have here a whiteboard. And, well, it should work. I've read it from some colleagues. I should work with some kind of toolbar. I didn't find out yet how it worked. But maybe one of you did, so... And the documents in the shared folder. Yes. Do we have to say something about that? I'm not fully updated about this shared folder. Yeah, I guess we'll have a shared folder with documents that can share. Yes, well, we'll then find out how it works. Yes. Well, this seems to me as some computer program, but I didn't find it yet. So, we'll come to that later. So, now we will try out the whiteboard we have here. So, I would suggest... Each of us is going to... Well, yes. We try to draw on it and then... Well, it should be smart some way. I'm not really sure how this works. Okay. Shall I stop? Yes, I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard. But they'll be recording. So... Now they will record through that, in a sense, so that we just need to record the strokes. But for us it's just like a normal whiteboard. Okay. But it's... Actually, I think I can't grow with... You... Doesn't it work? Maybe some... maybe Anna, maybe you can start and you can maybe find out. To get a score, right? I have to draw... Why don't you draw your favorite animal on the whiteboard? My favorite animal. Sorry, it's a little time, but up here. Oh, I see... There we go. So, draw it. We will try to guess what it is. I'm a very bad drawer. Weird. You're not going to be able to guess from my drawing. I'm not going to be a bad drawer. There, ears, by the way. No? Close side. Okay, so, like a pet animal. Like a cat. It's like a cat. So, I guess it's a cat. No, not a cat though. What is this now? You forgot about him. You're on the knife? Yeah. I think it's fine. I just don't want to cut it off. And this wire, no? We need a wireless microphone. You know? Especially, we should next pause it. We should take it like that. Oh, sorry. That's the cat. It's not a cat. It's a dog. Yes. So good. That's also kind of cat. Oh, the dog doesn't have a tail? It's got a tail in. Both predators, sure. Yeah. Yeah. I thought so. The dogs have a tail. It's all for the cats. Did you? And he gets cast out of tail. Yeah, I think I will go without it. Right? Okay. It will still not extend, right? It's not up to that. Yeah. So, what? Favorite characteristics? Dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun. Oh. What's that? To another ski. Of course. Yes. This is why you're the designer. Am I marketing? Yes. Yes. Definitely a whore. Yes. Very good. So, yes, with different colors. So, ah. I think you can put that. We can spend weeks. I'm at 20.4. Is it there? Yes, sir. So, no, it's zero. A blue and black zebra. Yes. Again, you can meet him in Africa, I think. Very good. Very rare blue zebra. Yes. Oh, I love. Yeah, that's true. I have to go clear off my......lilence. Don't need to talk about that. Yes. Sir. You've got a lot of room here, you probably. Rich. It's not for them. I hope you have some space in here, the horse of......Meal. Sir, what did I draw? We have already taken the pen. That's a good dog. Really? A mouse? Oh, no. This looks like a cat who has been driven over. A cat? You always play with it. Oh, okay. And we should sum up its favorite characteristics, right? Yeah, some cats would be......the cats. Yes, the mooftars. So, that's the leek cat? Yeah. They like to sleep, that's why you said you......they are like this. It's easy to just take a rest to me. It's quite, you know, relaxed situation. Yeah, it's quite relaxed today. It's like a......they're very good at sex for you. That's okay. So, you have some small legs. Thank you, Matthew. Oh, that's kind of bad here. Thank you, Matthew. It's a very big rat, very small rat. I hope they get something. Yes, this is certain......some contribution to our positive name. So, let's see which animal has not been drawn yet. So, you've all drawn bland animals, so why not draw an animal in water? Okay, in the water. I don't know what that is. It's a bit hard to guess. Yeah. Put it in colors, maybe to the help. Yes. The cat is going to eat the fish or the......different bandwidth. So... Oh, it's a shark now. It's a shark, yeah. Oh, yes. Why not? Good idea. I could maybe shark it goes to me. It's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish. No, it's a swordfish. You have something in Australia, right? Swordfish? Yeah. I don't know. Maybe. Another same one. I hope it still works. I'm sorry. So, I don't know if we need to spend time on that, actually. Well, this tool seems to work. Yeah, exactly. Let's continue to do real stuff. Our project finance thing. When we are......and when you are going to design, we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product will be about 25 euros. When designing a project, I also look at you a mile. Yeah. Keep in mind, people want to get the feeling this is a 25 euro project. Peruent control? Yeah, project. Yes. Okay. More interesting for our company, of course, profit aim, about 50 million euro. So, we have to sell quite a lot of this things. We will try to get at the international market, so it will be, I think, mainly Europe and Northern America. Oh, yeah, the seven men. Maybe some Asian countries. Also, important for all is the production cost. Maximum 12 euro. So, it's half of the selling price, if I am good in mathematics. Yes. I mean, we still have to make our profit. Of course. You all have to pay. Excuse me. We have to sell at least 4 million to make our own profit. Oh, yeah, very good in mathematics. Yes. 4 million. So, I think when we are working on the international market in principle, it has enough customers. So, when we have a good product, we could meet this aim, I think. So, that about the finance. And now, let's have some discussion about what is a good remote control. And, well, keep in mind this first point, it has to be original, it has to be trendy, it has to be user-friendly. Maybe some one can mention some additional rerequisites for a good remote control. Of course, it should have an honor, but... Yes, it should have the expected functionality of a remote control. Yes. And it depends what application you are using it for. You might need... We are thinking television. We are targeting the television set, so you need to record channels. Yeah. You need to browse the channels in upwards. Yes, that's very handy. I always miss it and also remote controls that you can go channel up or down instead of re-typing the number, especially when you have to load channels. And just before starting the detailed discussion, maybe you are the marketing guy. I'm marketing. So, you are marketing and you are in user interface design. So, I just wanted to be sure. And I am the industrial designer. Yes. Because I don't know you very well actually. I am not too well. I'm happy to meet you. And I'm not. And I'm not. I'm not too. I think you know me. Yes. Just on your web page, but not face to face. So... So, some other very important things to do. Well, to specify in this first phase of the project, the browse function. Yeah. And you need the user once like changing the volume, changing the channel and then you, today we have teletext and all those things. Tomorrow you might have some more functions which might come to the... Like what? Like internet on the... You know we are looking for television things or IP. For example, personal video recorder and all those stuff are coming up. But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet. It's coming up actually. The personal video recorder and all those things. Well, I think... Actually, yes. You should, I think, think this over especially what functionality. Of course, and first, before designing the... Well, thinking about the functionalities, we need to know what are the user requirements. Then if they need internet, then we would be able to propose something with the TV over IP. But before... Ninety percent of the time, ninety-nine percent of the time people will be using the main functions, the volume, the different channels. So we can have all the fancy things as well. But the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use. Keep in mind, it's a 25 euro unit. So the very fancy stuff, we can leave it out, I think. So 25 euro, you expect a quite, well, normal, but good functioning user-friendly remote control. In that case, you always hook up with someone who is providing that and you know... You sell that product as well as your product with them. So try and get TV, many things. We're on to designing you one. Yeah. No, it's okay. Yeah, I understand. So we need some numbering buttons, some teletext things. And then... The main is... About the buttons that will be on it. I think we can discuss that in the next meeting. Yeah. I would like to get this wrapped up and go to the end of this meeting. Okay. Okay, we are all ready. Okay. So you know now the basic things. Yeah. And... Well, just for the next meeting... Yeah. You will work on eight designs. Keep it general. I mean, so we will be still flexible with maybe adding some functions. So... You will be working on technical function design. Yeah, sure. And... When you... Well, think about requirements. Does it need internet? Or do we stay at... Basic... Basic television interface? So... I think we should now go work at this. And you will be informed to find email and kind of communication. Yep. Okay. So the next meeting will be in 30 minutes. Keep in mind. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
