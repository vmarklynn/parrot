 I wonder how many other meetings is talking about the stuff with the meetings. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look at all these stuff, man. What is that? Okay. Right. So, what do we need to talk about? Shall we just go around and everyone says what they've been doing? We've done anything. Not a lot. Well, I'm sorry. Yeah. Okay. Sounds like you've done something. Okay. Well, I've got a browser now, which, whoops. All right. Good stuff. Oh, I dropped mine as well. Give it this. This wasn't a good story. Okay. Yeah. So, yeah, we've got a browser with, which comes up automatically with the transcription box and the topics. And then when you go on the menu, you can select the summarization box, which pops up, and an audio player. Right. And I think the search works as well. So, pop up the search. And it loads up just the background window, so empty. And so when you start, you have to either open, open a particular observation or do a search and open it through that. That makes sense. The transcription box has got a summarize button, which doesn't do anything yet. Now, I wonder how we want to do, you know, we want to pop up window with the speaker characterization. Either we could do that, you know, when does a pop up come? Either we can, when you click on the ID, any sort of ID in the transcription box, or we can put an extra button, extra few buttons next to the summarize button, so that you actually in the transcription box, but so like you click on the button and then it opens into whatever that speaker characterization is. The left click is already used because it highlights that part of speech or whatever that, what are you saying? The left click, all right. The left click highlights it. Right. So that you can, I don't know what happens when you double click actually, but that'll be a bit annoying if you have the left click for one thing and double click for something else. I think, so yeah, when you left click it, you can, for example, set the marker there so that the audio goes from there, I think. So we can't put it on left click. We could put it on the right click. We could, for example, have a little menu that pops up. Yeah, it might be quite good, I suppose. So right click on it menu, you know, and you can click on speaker characterization of the pop cylinder. What else could we have in the menu? That's a good point. I don't know. So otherwise we just have a right click on you. Yeah, but I don't know about you, but usually in windows right click. Is it window? It opens a menu. The menu, yeah. Yeah, it's way to be, doesn't it? It's a bit weird to just start bringing that stuff in it. Yeah. It just sounds sort of, same sort of idiom throughout. Yeah. Yeah. Or just, you know, or just the button. I guess a bit of button makes a bit more sense because otherwise you don't really know that. Oh, what if I write click now? What happens then? Well, no, more. It's not a visual. Yeah. The menu pop up. Well, oh, yeah. It's more obvious. It's more idiot proof. It's got a button. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. It's more interesting. Well, we'll have more things in the future than we have. Maybe. Maybe. More flexible. Yeah. Well, I guess in meeting browser 1.1, you can have a menu instead of a button. Right. Right. This one. But actually what we could do is in that menu as well, we could have an option that pops up a window with all the meetings that that user has been in. Like a search for that user. Yeah. Is that going to be useful or too much? I guess so. So what did you, part of the menu that comes down is says, give me all your meetings or something. Yeah. So when you write click on it, one option will be, give me all your meetings, characterize the speaker. Yeah. Or is that too much? I mean, I guess so. It's more like part of the. Browsing sort of thing more than the speaker character. Yeah. Steve mentioned. Yeah. So we didn't know how to. Yeah. Involve the speaker characters. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe tie that in with dialogue acts or something as well. I mean, speaker characterization. I don't know. Just some way to sort of leverage that information. Like we have it for doing it. But what does it help the browsing or what can it give us? What do you mean that the speaker characterization? Oh, well. Yeah. I don't know about that. I mean, the speaker characterization is a bit like you said. I mean, it's like a nice thing. We're not actually sure what the user wants with it, but it's interesting. So why don't you give it to him? Yeah. I think we should do it. Yeah. I mean, I guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like, well, if you get the speaker characterization that someone talks a lot in a certain topic. And then if you click on that topic, you get everything that's in that topic. Yeah. I mean, that's still another level further. I mean, we're not even there yet. No, no, no. No, no, no. The pop of the speaker characterization. We have to first define what happens when you click on a user. If they have a speaker characterization first before we cross any other, I would be so happy. Yeah. So should we try to do a right click when you then? Yeah. All right. Yeah. All right. That's just from the main. Even if anyone comes in a particular window, like we want to sort of get like if we're on the users versus like a topic or something. Yeah. Yeah. For these various things. Yes. Wait. Yeah. There's a second thing about the topics, the topic window. You want to somehow click, be able to click on a topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that. Right. Yeah. So we could do that in a similar way to it right. Okay. So this is for consistent round. Yeah. On the speaker. So, yeah. This is. So we have basically two options of browsing the meetings is by either. Searching and opening. Individual observations and when then we have the interlinking by right click. Okay. Actually, yeah, like another common thing like if we have it so set up that if you double click and it goes to a default thing on the screen. I mean, that's kind of a typical kind of action. Double click. If you double click on a particular topic or something, then it goes to sort of like a default. Oh, so it will be like all the. Um, cases of that topic either, whatever we decide the default to be, whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting and just show up the particular. Instances of that topic. And just think to have the default there. So if somebody knows exactly what they want to do and we know that that's the most common thing that's going to happen. So the double click will do that and say from the trouble of right clicking and choosing the item on the menu. I don't see there's anything obvious that would be able to know that would be. Might come to us. Start playing with it. What was that? I think I understand. Do you mean like we have to do the right click menu? Yeah. Right click. But instead of like have a default double click. Oh, so it will be a choice. It's the most common. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Like I'm not sure the speaker characterization. Then there's a problem with a lot of windows popping up again and they pop up without you being quite sure what it is. Yeah. But if you do double click on something, don't you expect something to happen? Yeah, I mean sort of. It's not as you did. I'll go away. Stop coming up. I'll be closing. Yeah. It's not. Especially if you haven't touched panel. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I'll check what it does on double click at the moment. Yeah. Because I think it might do something. It's good. But I don't. I don't. I really don't see anything obvious that. I mean, if you can think of something. I guess at the point, I'm. The. Yeah. What you're clicking on. Yeah. Another thing. Single audio files. Do we want to use them or not? We don't know. Yeah. Do you mean single channel? Yeah. Single channel. Single channel files. Do we want them? I mean. Probably not. But we might need them for the experiences. If we try to do it in audio. Yeah. Yeah. We might use them. No, but. To work with them. But do we want to integrate them so that when you browse, we can. We might want to be able to say, oh, just give me what that person saying. Do you though? No. No. It's not going to make much sense if you're listening to it on his hand. Do you? Unless you can't hear it properly or something. Somebody's talking over somebody else or something. Which is saying note for now and put it in. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because otherwise it will increase the amount of data we need for a lot of time. Yeah. The footprint will be there. Mm-hmm. Yeah. What do people think in general about the Windows Cluttering that you mentioned? Do you think we need that? I think we probably need that. Don't have the full flexibility we need to have. That's what I feel as well. I mean, I'm very much, I want to have everything customizable. Mm-hmm. The thing is typically though, is someone can have five Windows open at the same time? Probably not. Probably just two or three of whatever. Two or three of whatever. Whatever they're looking at like dial on their x. Yeah. But yeah, it depends. I mean, I really want to put the summary in somewhere, you know. And the summary, for example, is typical you open the window, you read through it, you might click up, you know, close it against straight away. Yeah. But it'd be good to have it there. I think it's fine. Well, it couldn't be. I mean, you probably, I don't know if you want to have like the full transcription and the summary at the same time. So maybe you can just like choose the same window for transcription and summary. It's like how a tab there. I was just like in a tab. Yeah. Tabs are nice. Yeah, Tabs are nice. Yeah, Tabs are nice. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. I'm not sure. Yeah. I'm sure. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It's a bit of a cripple job as a windowing toolkit. Sometimes it's a bit of a cripple. I can have a look. Yeah. Or just, I don't know. Yeah, that might be changed to contents of the same window. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or even just have buttons on it. Toggle buttons or something on the toolbar. That window. That's something. Yeah. Yeah. That doesn't have to be a tab or whatever. No, no. It could be like transcription, summary, like two buttons and you just press on one button. Or check marks. Yeah. That would reduce the number of windows needed. Which is for you. Photoshop has a lot of windows. If you use Photoshop, it's got loads and you're always forever going. I'll get out of the way. There's always stuff in the way. I don't know why. I mean people get used to it. When you use windows, you have a lot of windows open. Do you manage them? Yeah. Yeah. Unless Kenny, I don't suppose you can minimize them and stuff like that. Yeah. You can minimize them. Yeah. Yeah. Of course you can. Yeah. Like a lot of these can be. Like once we get the disfluencies out, then we can, you know, transcript with the disfluency transcript with the different disciplines. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. I love these sort of using the same window. Yeah. They're definitely going to be in the same window. Yeah. And probably mutually. Yeah. That was a plan for the disfluency anyway. Yeah. So. Yeah. Do you want to do that with summaries and put the summaries in in the same window? Yeah. Well, I don't know. With transcripts. It sounds reasonable to have like transcripts, like maybe three alternatives then like full meeting, meeting without disfluencies and summarize. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And finally, the prototype is about what kind of prototype could be produced? Probably. Because I'm just, you know, I go into the lab and I say, like, what am I going to change today? You know, and it kind of just, it just develops. I'm not aiming for anything. Do we want to aim for something? Um. I'm pretty much getting there anyway. It's not going to be a lot more. I guess it is. I mean, just to try it. I mean, for us to be able to do something that we can include with your thing. Yeah. That's what we need. Yeah. Yeah. Something just slightly more than just that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just so see the integration works sort of between the different couple. Yeah. Definitely. So I guess that's what we need to take it for. I think that's kind of what it meant as well, isn't it? Yeah. Ting it, ting it sort of start to do stuff rather than just be. Yeah. Well, I guess, I mean, that was probably our intention, but we might not have written it down. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable, then we know the directory to get in. Yeah. Sure. I don't know if it's readable at the moment, but you can show it. Yeah. Yeah. I think you put it on there. No, they're not world readable. They're not done. They're only default. Then only you can read them. You can see them, but you can't read them. Okay. Right. Well, I'll make that readable then. Yeah. So the directory is my number. Or you could just email. Okay. Yeah. Well, this is not difficult. What's your number? Okay. In all the emails. Yeah. So it's my five five five six. Again. Oh, for a four five five six. And then it's. And then there's a folder. And it's called the m browser. The M browser. Yes. M for me. I hope you never have to look in my directory. It's just pure chaos. No, I'm extremely organized. Mine is serious chaos. But I was everywhere. Yep. So that's me doing someone else want to talk about this stuff. Final jump at one. I'm not sure. I can tell you what I done in the SPT. Oh, I don't know. I basically started like browsing a bit just like trying to see if there's anything out there to use sort of. What were you doing again? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Like that was behind the question. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Using code and stuff. All right. And you found some code for it. Yeah. Well, I don't know if it's usable. I haven't looked at it, but I found some code for like from a tutorial about indexing. Oh, cool. So even if it doesn't work, you can do a report grid around and make it work. Yeah. Well, probably stopped to do some other file management. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you think you shouldn't be too difficult? I don't know. I was a bit worried about one. Well, when he talked about this with a file, that's not what it falls. I mean, how much do we actually need to do like extracting things from XML files and stuff to be able to do the indexing? Oh, I see. Yeah. I have to convert it to some sort of format. I've been trying to write something to read the XML and get rid of it. And I can get rid of it, but I'm having trouble pointing anywhere else. So it'll come up on the screen. I mean, I have a look at the browser code then because, you know, they're already extract, for example, transcripts. Yeah. I'm sure they do. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I will. I'm sure I'm making a main of it. Yeah. I guess, I mean, it was a good point you had that like collaborating with the file things. I mean, if you already started on. Yeah. Yeah. We can share as much as possible. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Should we, I don't know, meet up and see what we can do. I mean, I don't know, see what you've done and see what we need, what we need. Yeah. Next week, I'm done. So you're still. I actually haven't done anything this week because this week's been manic. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, this week's only two days old. Well, whatever it was last week. Oh, yeah. The week as he is rather than the proper week, you know, it's been all a bit manic. Well, that's your NSP and LPN SP2. That's right. Yeah. That's right. And then we had to do an IRP, whatever it was last week as well, which is only a page long, but it's quite difficult to write a page. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's complete. Yeah. But it was, I had to sit there and think about it for a bit. This is a bit irritating. Yeah. But SP and LPN. Yeah. So, yeah, I was thinking the week, Jen, probably started attacking this seriously. I'm just, you know, hopefully I'm something buying next week that we can sort of try and decorate it into the group. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well, so the browser's, I use it now. Or as, you know, it was there when I took it. Um, uses the, um, the NXT search to get the data out of the files, which I think is odd, but I'm not quite sure how it works. I don't quite understand it. So when it, when it. To get the data, for example, to get the summarization data, you have to search for, I think, the IDs or something. Yeah. That's privacy always. Yeah. I guess it's like, where it's got the, that is privacy. So they don't, you know, they don't say, look in that, not folder, but, yeah, such everything. That is privacy always. Hm. Well, they did say it wasn't the most efficient. It does load up quite quickly. Okay. Okay. But, you know, but what, what is it like a window where you have to write a search query or is it just what's behind it. So, or not the actual search. This is just when you open, you know, to load the transcript, for example, yeah, to find the transcript. It does does the next see search for the string. I don't know, transcript or text. Okay. So, for, and it, what, like, it just has an open variable, transport, whatever, find everything that's got that and then load. So, I don't know if you've looked at the search query language, but it's like a dollar, a text. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because that's the, I could, the close variable doesn't have any. Yeah. And then, yeah. Because every, every of all of these, um, these files have got an ID and all the transcript files have got the string. I don't know what it is, words or text or something. So, I just search for those files. Okay. What do you do? When you, like, is there a open thingy or, what are you, like, what did you do to, like, how did you figure out that this uses the next to the search? Um, is it, um, well, it's in the code. Okay. So, you know, you define a search object and then you search about the string. I had to figure out how to, how to do the same thing for the summary. That's how I, how to understand how to do the transcript, how they did the transcript to do the summary. So did you have to write it in the way that they wrote it? Is that what you did? Yeah. Just search for specific string. One. I just think. So, you could just, you know, you could use that when you, if you were, um, take the data out. If you did that, I was just thinking that you, yeah. Yeah. If you have a question about what the code means or where to find the code that you want, you know, whatever you want to do, then just send me email. I can explain it. Yeah. If it annotated your code. Oh, yeah. No. Actually, in the moment it's got a load rubbish because the, the, the browser that I used from this, from, you know, that they gave us had a lot of extra stuff in and I have debt thrown out to throw out all the functions. Just in case. Just in case. Yeah. So they're all in there. Still a lot of rubbish, but we'll be, we'll be chucked down at the end. Coming, commenting it out one bit at a time. Running it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Yeah. So basically we got kind of this work. Yeah. Yeah. That's just too long. The last of that is a little bit of a log in the short. We can, but we can still fall days off. Yeah. Still at the bottom of the mountain. How many hours is this? Yeah. How much? Well, should you find his what to explore any other. How's your, how's your, how's your, um, uh, quantifier raising? Yeah. I can't remember what I'm supposed to do, by the way. Am I supposed to do the summarization thing you bought? No. What's doing? I'm just going to go to the next slide. You do. Oh, really? Well, I'll do that then. This can be changed. Shall I do that? I mean, I don't know. It doesn't matter. Well, you know, if you want to, I mean, let's just play around with some extra stuff. We have some time. Why not? It shouldn't be different. So what courses should I pick to be not doing any good? Yeah. And I'm doing communications. Which we had one exercise and I've done that like two weeks ago. That's in two weeks. In products, of course. Yeah. So I was like nine, nine courses, well, ten or something. Okay. And then I'm doing parallel programming languages and systems. Which we had one exercise as well. And that seemed like Friday. Well, I'm not doing any background reading. Sorry. Just a big, yeah. I'll be happy when this week is over. I'll be happy when this course is over. Yeah. I don't know. Is that about it then? Anything else we need to discuss? Did we want to meet before we talk to Steve next week? Well, I don't know. We'll probably get some work done over the weekend. So I know after the analogy or something. And just have a little quick little update. Yeah, if you like. Yeah. We can always decide then. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So what are you planning to do over the weekend then? Search. You're going to do the search. I'm going to do the search. Couldn't be that hard. Well, it'll be still limited version of the next query. Don't be the whole thing. Like we can just decide sort of things that we do want to do. Well, actually, most of just dialogue acts. And I'll switch around. I think we need to set ourselves some milestones because otherwise. Yeah, we'll get. We'll get by. Pretty quick. Like you're saying, like she do, we want to set a date for interim prototype. Specifically. I think. Oh, you decide. I'm not. I'm not. The progress report is. Two and twenty. The third. Of February. So what's that to me? Yeah. Well, how about we get it done by then? Yes. Yeah. Then we can write about it in the interim report. Yeah. Yeah. So. Just looking at my own deadlines. Yeah. Oh, when the search interface. Maybe you should decide pretty, pretty early what kind of things you want to be able to search for. And then if you want, you can give out to me now. I'll build your nice, you know, a few tick boxes and drop down menus. Wasn't like what you had now. Wasn't that pretty much what we read on or was it just like so on. That doesn't exist. That was completely cut and pasted. Oh, okay. That does not exist. Nicely done, though, isn't it? It's actually all these things that are nicked from, you know, all these drop down menus and tick boxes are nicked from Google. It's a screenshot of Google. Oh. That's not. I'm impressed. Maybe you should make it exist then. It's going to be a little difficult. Yeah, I mean, I was going to, but, you know, the whole drop down menus and stuff, what we want to search for is not quite agreed on. We never agreed on what we want to be able to search for. No, it's not. So, aside on that, I'm probably going to. Yeah, do you want to, you know, just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do. And then we could discuss at next meeting, which options we really want to include. I would probably involve researching the query language a bit as well to see what that can do. It would be nice to meet up and show us a bit, but, you know, already, so we don't have to do all the work again. Just like figuring out stuff. Oh, just like the basics. No, already. Just like accessing the corpus and stuff. Oh, just like all the, and seeing the code and just sort of how just to see the basics of what you've done, like just get a quick look over and just can take us for a tutorial. Yeah. You know, the class paths, all that sort of thing. Just say, okay, well, here's everything's basically. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just show up. Okay. Next week's. In the morning. Yeah. Yeah. Well, there's some I'm the teacher. Something like that could happen anytime because, yeah, like my schedule was like a class, right, class, right, class. Yeah, I was not going to take an hour. Yeah, I know exactly. Yeah. That's why I'm thinking so I'm like that man. If I have a class, I can run off and do it. Yeah. Pick a time. Yeah. Monday, Monday might be good. Yeah. Monday. Yeah. Anytime. Not at noon or two or four. No, in between those. Three o'clock. Actually, yeah. Three. It was one time today and I'll do four. It's four. I guess you want to do it after. Yeah, that's an option too. Yeah. Three. Three is good though, but we have. Three 30. Well, it doesn't matter. Three 30 in the computer room in here and then we can just go in there. If you can get in the front door, we haven't got a key. Can none of you get in? We can get in the three. The computer rooms in here, the MSC computer. I don't found that yet. It's in here. If you find me, I'll show you where I let us all in there. Now, afterwards. Yeah. You did need to have a key for it. That's the thing. Just bang on it. Yeah, somebody else was asking Steve about that whether we can get in there, whether he's going to get us access. Into what? The computer room. Okay. It's only got this crap. It's only got about four or five convenience. But it would do quite a good garage. Because it can all sit around. It's not very up. Not many people in it. Is there a printer in there too? And there's a photocopier with the code on it. It's cool. Well, I'm just going to cover it. I've heard of it. I've heard of it. We've got it on my computer. Yeah. One of the comments I'm thinking. So, what time do we say? I just think it's better to do afterwards than we have all the time. Yeah. That's all right. Yeah. Then have half an hour and then we'll definitely run out. Yeah. Okay. As long as the analogy doesn't go late. Hopefully it's not that man's hurt. It won't matter. Actually, it's not even confirmed yet. What? She doesn't even know what she's talking about yet. Maybe it doesn't happen at all. It's reading week next week. Should it be? Really? Well, it's supposed to be. Next week. It's week six next week. I don't think we have a reading week though. I don't know. We have one class at least. When we speak perception, we don't have any lectures. But I think we have a lot of classes. I don't think there was an official one last semester. I think it was just a bad call. Something like that. I think one of the classes did. Some classes did. Yeah. We should have picked up. I think the undergraduates had a word. It was up to the professor. I don't feel like it. I think it's a good thing. I think the DIL will probably have one to make up for missing classes. What? DIL. We'll probably have one. Yeah. It's been another last week. Okay. It's me Monday. Yeah. I guess that's it. Was there anything else? Do anyone know you want to take care of this or should I take care of it? We trust you. I don't know if there was something I think he basically said. The same thing as in the comments. If I could read it. Maybe that. On the top one. Do you really want multiple windows from a single app? But most will probably want to go with the faults. Yeah. That was for the same. Yeah. I think it comments basically the same as what you said. Yeah. Exactly. Just the other comment about whether you want to do both speaker characterization and topics of intention. So, yeah. That's right. Yeah. And now we have 7% of the course already. That's right. That's right. That's right. So, we need to take the okay box right? If you're okay with it having. It's like buzzing. Signing off. Yeah. Oh, God. Should we turn these off? We're done now. Is she still here? Yes, you are. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
