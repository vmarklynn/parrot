 We still have to do our questionnaire. Okay, first of all, I'll start with the costs. Because that's going to influence our design. Alright. If you don't know if you already had a look or not. Did you do your questionnaire already? I already did it. It's not much suggestion. Because we have a problem. If you look closely, you can see it. And I already took the liberty to make some suggestions. At the moment, we have 15 buttons. One LCD screen. One advanced chip on print. We use a sensor, this is for the speech. We use kinetic energy. And we wanted the buttons in a special color. Okay. First thing we should do is draw a special color of the buttons. No, that's for the trendy feeling. Everything is. But we switch to a hint dynamic. Because that's still the same idea as kinetic energy. Because you have to use it and do that. Yeah, but I don't think people like it. Just do a normal battery. Just do a normal battery then. It has to be 12 and a half. Oh my goodness. You're going to need these. Oh no. Okay. So we're at 25. Do we keep the shape doubly curved or do we go for single curved? I guess we'll have to go for single curved. I mean we have to drop on everything. But we can keep it single curved with top view still curved. From the side it's flat. You just have to hold it like this then. How about, sorry. Another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine. So you can directly access a channel. But instead I use only the up and down errors. And we don't have any basic options anymore. Oh yeah. And then they don't need special colors. They don't need special colors. Fine. We like it. Yeah. You were saying. That was exactly my point. Like let's drop all the buttons and just make one. I mean we're going to use the LCD screen anyway. So we'll just have to use it for everything. And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen and select the channel. Click. Okay. So maybe we can drop a few more buttons. Let's see. We only need the manual arrow button thing. Everything you can do with the menu. Yeah. We need one integrated button for everything. Yeah. A joystick. Yeah. Kind of. Because. If you go to our. If you are in the sound system there. And you want to adjust the treble for instance. This is just an example. You want to see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example. But you want a sound preview of how it's going to sound right. So you want to click on it. It's activated and when you move it here the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound. So you'll need a kind of a joystick. Yeah. Or a button. Or a scroll wheel push button. Yeah. So that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it. Adjust it. Click again and then you're out of it. But you still. But you then still need to have. Well you can use the scroll wheel as well for maybe for the channels. But you still have to have some button in the menu to go back. You can do one integrated scroll wheel push button. Yeah. And then just drop all the other buttons. Well not all. Not sound I guess. The cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push buttons. Yeah. It's one integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button. So we have to make it more. You could also drop three more of these without losing much functionality. Yeah. What is the sample sensor? Sample speed. Oh that's for the speech recognition. Yeah. Good. Speech recognition. No but. Yeah that's possible. Yeah it's expensive but we never considered the possibilities of speech recognition. Because it can take the function of a lot of buttons. But it's not very easy to use. No. It can be disturbed by noise. Yeah. Unless you say that speech recognition works. Let me see what's more popular. I guess the screen was more popular than the speed recognition. Yeah. I have to look on that. Let me see. Oh no. There are more people who like speech recognition than LCD screen. Okay. But if the LCD screen. But it's both. A whole lot of concept. Yeah. No. Yeah we keep the screen. I mean it's about the same. 81 to 91 percent. Yeah we haven't really integrated the speech into the system so we can drop that. Yeah. Let's drop the speech. For less years. 16 years. We still have three and a half year to lose. We need to lose some buttons. Yeah if you lose the back. The okay button. Let's say we only have the four arrows. Yeah. And then use. Or in the power button. Okay and the menu button does also does the okay function then. And then when you in the menu. So you activate menu. If we do a two integrated scroll we will push buttons. We can drop all the push buttons. With one integrated button we can do the whole menu thing. Yeah. That would save 0.2 euros compared to. No. No it's three euros. Yeah. This together is more expensive. Yeah. It's almost the same as this. Okay. For example if you have four buttons. The channel up and down for you left right. That's basic. That's what you need anyway. And then for the menu. You can have a button that activates menu. Or do we just integrate and scroll wheel with a push button. And then if the moment you use the scroll wheel the menu gets activated and then you can scroll to an option. Click on it. It goes into a feature. Click on it against flex feature. Scroll adjust it. Click again. It's okay. Then you only need one button to move back. Or under each option. You set a screen thing with says back and you select that one. Click again. And then you scroll back and in that menu scroll. Click one step back. So then you need five buttons. And one integrated scroll wheel push button. But you can drop three buttons. But I see that's one year or more expensive. Yeah. So I could have had the option. Because which button do we have now? Those five which I mentioned and then menu. The four things. Four arrows. Yeah. Power. If you go to eight I don't know how to. Yeah. Okay. So four arrows. Yeah. Power. Power. Yeah. That's five. We have a back and a okay button. Yeah. Okay. That's seven. I want to activate menu. Yeah. Okay. That's eight. And then you can read the menu. We keep the display. Okay. Even if we drop three buttons from here we still have to make some adjustments around here. Yeah. Yeah. We need the chip for the for the LCD display. Yeah. Yeah. We need the advanced. Okay. It's plastic. Instead of. instead of... Then we ought to make it wood, because that also is good in the market with the 45 plus people. Yeah, but that's not our market. No, that may be not, but maybe......and it's better than plastic anyway. I don't know, hard plastic. Plastic with a special color. Yeah, a plastic with a special color. Yeah, a special color. Okay. No, because we have to use the special color anyway, you forgot that. Yeah. Yeah. So let's go for the plastic. Yeah, okay. Plastic. And since it's not kinetic, it doesn't have to flip around that much. It's free. We still have a problem of two euros. Yeah, okay. If you drop to... The buttons, those are really neat. Yeah, we can drop them. It's an out-found strip on the front. Yeah, you still need... Do we really need that out-found strip for an LCD display? Yeah. So the other option would be to go for the sample speaker, which can use a regular chip, which is six euros in total. That doesn't matter. Oh. I'd rather keep the display. Yeah. Because we've already designed for it. The only option is in hand-dynamo. Yeah, and something else. All right, the other one. The camera, right. Can't we fit all the buttons in an integrated scroll push button? Because that will save us one and a half euro already. And then integrate it? Yeah, but that would make it not so easy to use. I mean, it's not that important, easy to use, but... Then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want. Yeah, two additional buttons, I believe. Yeah, at least one for power. I am power. Three buttons and this. It's just as expensive as what we have now. It's an integrated button. How many functions can it have? Three. Up, down. Yeah, endlessly. I mean, it can be a power button. As soon as it's powered on, you can... You can press it for like three seconds. Then you can choose a flip channel. You can choose sound options. Then you should do everything in the menu. Yeah. On the screen. Maybe we should, because we don't have money and we want to screen. You can choose this, drop this, then we have a half euro left. Yeah. So we can maybe still use power button. Yeah, but we... All right. I guess we have... It saves us four euros and it costs us two and a half. So, let's see. We need to drop the one and a half, but we still 13 left. Yeah. No, it doesn't miscalculate it. 13, so still half. There goes the special... That would make it less appealing, so that's no option. Okay, what else? Uncurved? We're sure about it at Fans' Chip. We need for the display. Yeah, it says right here. Okay. They made it very easy for us. Yeah. We made it hard for ourselves with the display, but it's a cool feature. I don't think I can persuade the management to say this is better for the market, so we sell more. Okay. What we could do is drop the special color for the buttons. Oh, yeah, since we only have one button. Yeah, but what is meant by special color? I guess something else. I think black or white. Yeah, I think it's gray regular. Yeah. All right. Gray and rubber. But we definitely want the thing to be a special color. Yeah. So, I rather have an hand-dynamo. Yeah. And then drop the color. Yeah. You can still play with it then, I guess. I don't know. Yeah, but a hand-dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the stream working, so I guess that isn't an option. Display. Yeah. You only have to power it up when you want to use it. Yeah. If you have to power it up for 10 minutes. No, I don't think the current status of chips are pretty... Yeah. Any shikun is saving the... Yeah, true. Yeah. Let's go for the hand-dynamo then. Yeah, hand-dynamo. Do we want an extra button? Or do we uncurf and flat instead of... No, no, it has to be curved. Yeah, it has to be curved and you have that color in the stream. Yeah, special form. That's the most important thing. Yeah. Is that also supposed to be too special? Yeah. Well, what a special form. Oh, a special form. Maybe that's nicer. For scroll. Yeah. Oh, no, we don't have any buttons. Yeah. So, do you have to make it a special color then? It's going to be integrated button, I think, also. Maybe make it a special color then. Yeah, just scroll. Yeah, push down. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Make it a special color and then it looks fancy. So... Whoa, we're in a bit yet. Yeah. Let's save it. Two special colors. We only have one button. Yeah. Okay. Let's do it like this. I mean, because it does not lose our identity of the product as we... Okay. So... Okay. This was old. Wow, we come back to the drawing board then. Yeah, back to work. Yeah, you're pretty much... It's silly because we should have had this meaning before we start drawing. Yeah, but that's a fun part of it. I wanted that a bit. I wasn't allowed. Okay. All right. I just forgot to save this. Just a minute. Off. Yeah. What's the next phase? Yeah, this is the last phase, of course. The agenda by your humble PM. Oh, first phase. All right. Yeah. Okay. Well, we first should have had a prototype presentation as well as you saw that hadn't made those sense because we had to... Drop everything. Drop. Yeah. We went straight into finance. Yeah. Yeah, it was more important. Yeah. Push it up to the agenda. Evaluation criteria and you have to use something about that? Yeah. I sure did. And it combines with product evaluation. So you put it in the... We all have to keep in mind what has changed now. So what we have left on the... Yeah. Because the evaluation is based on the initial user requirements. All right. Let's make it big. Well, we evaluate the design with a seven-point skill as following. Well, the remote controls recording criteria blah, blah, blah. Two are false and then on the scale of seven points. The leakage skill. So you all know it. Well, the criteria are based on the user requirements, the trends from the marketing research and the marketing strategy of the company itself. Well, there are any words, documents which are open now. I don't know, it's open yet now. We all have to agree on a certain level. What's this? I don't know. Well, the first point, the remote control matches the operating behavior of the young user. So that means the operating behavior was using quite a lot of functions. How do you think about that? I think it does. Because the operating behavior of the young user was also defined in color and shape and the use of LCD, right? Yeah, the user. It's mainly constraining on a lot of functions in this question. Well, we have extended menus. Yeah, you can make a lot of extended menus. That's true. I mean, the possibilities are almost unlimited to build a menu in the screen. Yeah. So on the scale from one to seven, what do you think? Two or three? Two or three? Two or three? Something like that? Well, we have to choose one. So what do you say? I agree on two. You could build this in now. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I say two, personally. Yeah. I don't know. You would decide as a would say it's free, but now in order to decide. Yeah, but we have to evaluate, I guess, what we have now. Okay, then I say three. Yeah, you say three. Yeah. You say also three. Three. I say still two, but it has to be three then. You're marketing it. Yeah, I know. So it's made bold, but it's not very clear. Maybe you like. Maybe other color, yeah. Better. Red. Yeah. All right. It doesn't have to be bold anymore. All right. Oh, yeah. Are we true? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we're true. Well, the remote control. Definitely one. It has to be. The remote control hides irrelevant or less use functions. For example, audio settings and screen settings. Yeah. So it's a very true point. I mean, it hides all those functions. They're hidden in the screen if you don't want to use them. You just scroll over them and you place them. I don't know where. So that's very true, I guess, for our case. Yeah, the second point. Not so much. It shows the relevant, the most used functions. Power button. Do we have a still power button? Well, yeah, the buttons integrate. Yeah. So it's all huge. Yeah, we dropped it. You just push it in for our... It's integrated. Yeah, just push it in for three seconds or something. Exactly. It just goes for all the other things. Yeah. It shows relevant and most used functions. Yeah. On one side, we would say yes. On the other side, we would say no. I don't know. It shows the most used functions. And they are relevant. But each channel directly with just one button. With the scroll button. With the menu. Yeah, and then say channel. Well, we should build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something, when it's on, yeah? It's turned on. You need double click on the... It automatically has the program and the volume function. But as soon as you click it, you go into the menu or something. Yeah. Or you double click it. But how do you change from volume to channel? No, because it has four arrows, right? No, no. Because you scroll wheel. Yeah. I was thinking still about our integrated joystick. We have no balance left. So the joystick was not an option. Yeah, that's a bummer. So you have to double click for volume and three double click for the menu or something. Yeah. Hold it 10 seconds. Yeah. We'll make it a Morse code. But ease of use was not very important. Yeah, it should be true. Yeah, that's not a question. And the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions. Well, I think it's pretty much in the middle. Yeah. You have to search for them in the screen in the menu. Yeah. So maybe it's more like a five. Yeah, I would go for five or six. Yeah. Five or six. Five. Okay. Five. Five. That's not this hard remote. This is the weird remote control I've ever seen. Yeah. Yep. Just one button. All right. The remote control makes use of technological innovation like LCD screen and speech recognition. Well, yeah, we dropped the speech recognition, but it has at least one innovation. Yeah, I say to them. We still have the fruit and vegetable print. Yeah, but that's not this question. Never mind. The other question. I'm a bit lost. This one. I think that too. Too. Yeah. I think LCD is more usable than speech. Yeah. Not the bold one. It's way more practical. Right. Okay. It has a fancy look. I feel by using fruit vegetable prints primary colors, the sponge like material. It should have been two questions. Can't realize now because sponge like material is dropped, but the look I feel. Yeah. So we still have the primary colors. Yeah. But only on the outside. The button is also color. Yeah. Okay. The one button is yes. Yeah. Yeah. Still we dropped also on the double curve. Yeah. You can check with the cell sheet. Yeah. We have single curve now. And color. And no material. Yeah. So maybe in the middle or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's. Yeah. Works really. Works really. Yeah. Actually, we didn't do so well on this one. Because it's basically an old one with little curve on the side and in a different color. Still, it's still hard. Yeah. I mean, the sponge like and the 3D shape that would give it something young and fresh. Yeah. But then we would have to drop the screen. Oh, red. Yeah. You like both. Yeah. I like both. The remote control displays the corporate logo. Oh, yeah. Of course. You just have to draw. Just a minute. Yeah, but it's a white part. Because we couldn't hardly draw on the lower half of the screen. We couldn't make it big enough to actually draw in the. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, I wanted to put digits on the buttons as well. But there's enough space for the corporate logo. I mean, if there's only one. Yeah. If we have only one button. Yeah. So, I will say that is very true. And even the shape we have now simulates kind of an R and the reversed R, doesn't it? The remote control is easy to use. Well, I would say. No. Skill, I would say 6 or something. I don't think it's easy to use. The only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers. Yeah. Because there's only one button. And you only have to control one button. Yeah, exactly. And it has a nice screen. But, yeah. It gives facial feedback. Yeah. I would say 5 or 6. I would say 6. What do you say? It's really not easy to use. Because you're putting everything. So, 6 more. Yeah. Yeah, I would go for the 6 too. Okay. Most folks can't. Well, another question. The remote control is durable. I don't know if that's the correct word. Definitely in casing. And you have a hard place. Because you have a hard place. Yes, casing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, because the battery is toasting is less forever. True. True. And the casing is less. The casing is hard plastic also. That's the last forever. Yeah. If you don't drop it too much, it's a shoot last pretty long. I would go for one. Yeah. But I think rubber comparators better. So, I think a 2 is more appropriate. Okay, yeah. Wow. Yeah. Logo. Okay, I would go for two. The last one. The remote control is a good example for companies model. It puts a fashion in electronics. No. Now, let me put the electronics in the fan. Let's turn around. Yeah. I would go for four. Yeah. Because we kind of try to, but we kind of filled with the budget that we have. Yeah. True. Yeah, okay. A four. It's... It goes. It's not the best we could do, I guess. The last do with the budget because it's not the bad idea we had. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Right. So. So. That's it. If I understood it right, we have to count these numbers. Yeah. What? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. All right. Yeah. We have to count them. Count them. Add them? Yeah. Just add them and then... Define them. Start calculating. Yeah. I all made it. I all made it possible of positive questions. So we can count it. I mean, if you have reversed questions, you have reversed the skill. Okay. Yeah. So four. Did you make this question here? Yeah. Thanks. Nice work. Okay. Yeah. Three plus. I wouldn't be able to do that that fast. Plus one. Plus five. Plus five. Whoa. Oh. Easy. Question number four. Yeah. Yeah. Four. Wait a second. Oh. It's going wrong. How hard is it? Okay. Pretty difficult. Yeah. Just start over. Oh, it has no... There's no numpets. You can... No. That's why it's... It's a bit... Just type in the digits. They're all one digit numbers, right? And then you can count them together. Yeah. You can just count them by half. Okay. That's number four. Okay. Three. Four. Nine. Nine. Yeah. Eleven. Fifteen. Fifteen. Fifteen. Fifteen. Fifteen. Fifteen. Yeah. Seventeen. Oh, sixteen. Sixteen plus six. Twenty-two. Twenty-two. How hard is this? Twenty-two, yeah. Twenty-four. Twenty-four. Twenty-eight. Twenty-eight. Twenty-eight. Twenty-eight. Oh. That was the last one. Twenty-eight. Okay. Twenty-eight. Okay. Okay. Divided by nine. That's a three, yeah. The lower the score, the better, right? Yeah. Twenty-eight. Divided by nine. Divided by nine. Makes. Three points. One, one, one, one, one. So we're better than the average. Yeah. Are you sure this number actually tells us some things? No. I don't think so. Because some questions are related to positive issues and some two negatives. So if you give a true to a positive, it actually means that the lower, the better. But if you give true to a negative question. Yeah. But there are no negative questions, I guess. Yeah. Good example. Do you want to use? That's good. Easy to use. Easy to use. This way score is good. Fancy look and feel. That's good. Yeah. I think it was good because of a marketing requirement. Yeah. The motion function. I guess you should do it. It hides this function. That was also a good thing. Oh yeah. And then matches the operator of the user. That was also a good thing. Okay. So it was a positive question. Yeah. True. By purpose. So yes. So it tells us something. But the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those things. Those things. Yeah, definitely. Definitely. Because now it's just an average. Yeah. It's remote. It's better than average. Yeah. Okay. Because of the LCD screen. Yeah. So it looks and stuff. It's still. Yeah. It's not really eye catching except for the color. The color on the screen. Okay. So. This we had. This we had. Pro-typrestation. Pro-typrestation. We dropped. So. The finance. We looked. We have. Redesigned. Not one. That's. Yeah. We have to maybe. We have to redesign it on this case. No, it's right. So you can just make one big LCD screen. Well, some casing around it. Yeah. Okay. We're still going to go for the fancy colors. Yeah. Are we going to stick with the green or are we going to do blue? And you can just use this one and then over paint it with the blue color, the green. The only on the screen. The only on the screen. The only on the screen. The only on the screen. One scroll button. Oh, we have to delete it. A single curved. Yeah. Oh, and you might want to add a infrared red. Yeah. Oh. Oh. For what? That doesn't function. Okay. So. So that's. We have three other things. Well, I have to make a report for every decision we made so far. All right. And I tried to catch up just before I received the Excel sheet. Yeah. So you made it start, right? Yeah. I'm somewhere. Should you give it some time? Yeah. Yay. Okay. That's how do we make that a score? Yeah. Just one. I'm going to make this away also. And this. And that's the infrared. Oh, yeah. Of course. And pen. Yeah. For what? Shape. Current color. Oh. Oh. Yeah. We did a special color for the line width. No. That's it. Ten. It's going to be one. How many pages? I just took one for every. All right. You have done the first two. Yeah. Because you can, and the look and feel is more natural than this. I think I have to make a. Oh, that's a. Oops. Yeah. Yes. Basically. I do. We have to drop. Yeah. It smells very fashionable anymore. It's okay. It's really ugly. Yeah. Where did we start? Which fries? 26.5. Or. Or 26. Something. Like that. Yeah. That looks a little bit more. And it's a special color for it. So we can make it special. What do you mean? Like an olive color and this one. Or spickle, I don't know. Spickle. Yeah. Can we do a print? I'm not sure. I think we have to choose. If you see the up scenes. Okay. Special color. We do have special color. Does it mean? It's already a special color. Yeah. It's very special. Shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty? Yeah. Yeah. Some big dots. Purple. That's trendy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh no. My room. That's acne. Yeah. Oh. That's why we asked that button. Oh yeah. It's so cute. Oh. What? Whoa. Oh no. Just got. Control Z. Oh no. Is that that? Yeah. Oh no. Yeah. How the... Wait, did we do that? Just dual screen. No. Can we delete it? Yes, we delete it. We can try. It doesn't respond also to undo. It looks like it's... Cresh. No, I guess. Very nice. Why do you want some more dots? Yeah, over here. You can even draw anymore. Even children. You push the button or something. Can you just push the button and then... Oh, there's a select button. It's... Okay. It's not the prettiest. It's not so random. It's okay. I actually think that the R. Yeah, the R and another R. Yeah, okay. It's called the real remote, right? Yeah. Maybe it can say that. The real remote. Yeah, just on the LCD display. Yeah. Welcome. We can make a logo. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Put it like this shape. It's designed by... Something like that. I mean, it's not too... It's not their logo, is it? Yeah. Do they have a logo? Oh, here. This is the logo. Yeah. Two R's. One. And then we just reuse that. You can copy and paste it, picture, if you want. So, we do the logo in black or not? Yeah. Yeah. What's that? Looks more like campfire. Are you dissing my drawing? This one? Yeah. It looks like a ribbon. Yeah. Okay. So, we want to draw... This is actually quite fun. Do we need to do anything? I hear you people are typing. Typing the report. Okay. I don't see any new messages. Oh, luckily. Luckily. Is the last assignment or? Yeah. It's final. Yeah. It's almost four. What time do we have to deliver the report? Four o'clock? That's four, yeah. Before that. Okay. Just compare it. This is really bizarre. It looks like there's a... It looks like a butterfly. It's somewhere... It's inside. It's inside. No, it's on the beamer, I guess. No, but it's not a beamer. It's a normal TV screen. Kind of thing. Yeah, it's somewhere in here. It's somewhere in here. So, you have to... Save copy. Yeah. Strange. This is something that's projection from behind, I guess. There's a little sister. Oh. Yeah, there is some kind of projection, I think. Yeah, it's a beamer. But then we're in a... It's a mirror. Mirror, yeah. So, it looks like a big screen, but in fact it isn't. So, are we going to change anything to this? I mean, as well. Well, it's a single curve. So... This is going to be flat. Yeah, exactly. Okay, it doesn't matter. But it's better to have in the front this kind of shape because it looks nice. I mean, you see more of this than of that. Yeah. Yeah, more like that. Yeah. And this is also going to be... That's very ideal. No. It's sometimes then all of a sudden it does work. Yeah. What's this? That's the detector for the... Okay. I don't see the detector over there. I think you only need two points or not. I thought it was a kind of thing to put it on and then draw right lines or something. It's not working because it's more slanted. Yeah. Or just messed it up. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it matters for the aim of this thing. Yeah, well, it wasn't good. You have to make it 90 degrees. Yeah, it has to touch the corners, I guess. But this one wasn't good because if I was drawing here, I drew a line and then it came over here. No, you probably have to recalibrate. Five minutes to the end of the meeting. Oh, we're out. And the recalibration is done using this icon here. Can we get to that icon? Oh, it's so far. Yeah, well, I did. It's okay. It's working again. It's better than before. Yeah. You do it. Yeah, that's improved pretty much. It's only a bit like to that side, but that is that one, by the way. It's better. It makes the angle either like this. So if I change this, it will go there. If I change that, it will go there. It's better than it was, I guess. I will take this away because it looks silly. Yeah, it works pretty well. Five minutes before the meeting is over and then we have to present. I don't know if you have to present because I didn't receive any information about that. All right. Maybe we will. After these five minutes, you have to. I still have 10 minutes. What's this anyway? All right. After that five minutes, you have to finish it. It looks like candle wax. Yeah. All right. You can just relax with coffee or chill. No, I don't have beer. You can celebrate. You can just, if you finish my presentation. Yeah. The presentation is still open. So I should finish that and you'll see. Yeah. Next slide. Oh, yeah. We have to do the project evaluation. Just do that quickly. Yeah. How do you do it? Well, basically what that says, we discuss it. So how are the project process go? Are you really pleased with the process as well? Do you mean the interaction between us or? The interaction and the steps he followed. Yeah, well, at first I was really stressed because it went a bit fast. But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on the second time, I think I did a bit better. Yeah. In the third time, yeah. And we move more to working together as a team because at first you make your individual contribution and then come here and you have no idea what the others have to make. Yeah. And then finally you have some idea, okay, this is what we're going to make together and okay, I will arrange this and you will arrange that and you have a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own. So the process, I mean the interaction between us became better and better, I guess. Especially after the first meeting. Yeah, especially if you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting, I guess. Okay, and what's that due to my leadership? Yeah, yeah. Well, you did become more assertive the second time round to that. Yeah, yeah. You were more in charge kind of thing. Okay. Was there enough room for creativity? I guess so. Yeah. I mean, only the financial parts. The limited afterwards, but if you don't take that into account there's plenty of room for creativity also, not only the drawing and the making of thing itself, but also in explaining it to the other people by means of the board and the power point and word and stuff like that. So about the board and stuff? Was it helpful? I think in essence the digital pen is better than the smart board because it just works better. I mean, I've made several notes just to test it and just put the pen into it and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly so it's better device than the screen. Maybe the screen is useful in essence, but it doesn't work that well. But the pen is more intuitive because we're all used to writing with pen and as I said, I have no idea how power point works. So it will take me half a day to be able to make a normal power point presentation. But once I get to know the program, probably, I mean, it looks better, you know, or something like that, you can give it a kind of a home style like we have the logo and everything. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Morning. Finish meeting now. Okay. Are there any new ideas about this? Oh, I think it's really useful. It's especially useful, I guess, to evaluate designs and graphical stuff and the whole screen and stuff like that. I think the power point is too limited. You can draw easy in power point. The drawing board has to be integrated into power points so that you can just easily... Yeah. The problem with power point for me is that you have to put in the pre-made chunks as well. You know, you can draw something on the sketchboard and then take it there or whatever. Yeah. But it's useful to show something to a small audience and then to... It's okay, but... These kind of screens, these sides are useful to discuss things. Yes. Check your email. You should enter our questionnaire. T-shirt. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we, when we wait quite a minute and then for the heat to reach it, the everyday through I understand because there are three questions left. This is number eight. I'm going to go to the island on the coast. And then it's going to be the planet's view. All right. OK. I'm going to go to the island. OK. All right. Yes, boss. I'll just see you in a second. I'll see you soon. Up, up. Yeah. We have to pull it this way. What? It's going to hit you.
