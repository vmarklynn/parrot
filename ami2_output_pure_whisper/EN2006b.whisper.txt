 I think that should be a break for Anne. Sorry, this should be this one. Maybe that should be a bit of HTML goo. I think that should be a break for Anne. I think that should be a break for Anne. And I don't know what to do with the HTML goo. But this is Lambda. This isn't a separate thing. So I would agree that you're under Lambda. You underline the goo in each case, but not the end. Do you reckon this stands for Lambda? No, it's different. Is this my excitation emission lens? I think my excitation should be in because it's just saying. Just talking about the species and putting the emission that we're going from. Okay. Why don't you go get that? Maybe velocity. I think that's the answer. I agree for the key bubble. Yes, the key bubble. I think it's a whole name. I don't know if there's no way. I think it is all. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. These are my column densities. Yeah, these species' lines again aren't they? Yeah, that's fine. No, for some reason I think you've just died. You're right there. I forgot to keep track of the overall score like who wins the game. Yeah, it's so crass. And here again. That's a little bit tricky. It is, but is emission line AGN a separate class from AGN? I don't think it is. I think AGN. You can get AGN without emission lines, but I don't think you can get a separate class from a separate source. I think in people's paper he does, doesn't he? The paper I pointed you to a few weeks ago last week? I didn't know what it meant. I've seen people talk about them as separate classes, but I don't really know what that means. I guess there is a difference between an AGN with emission lines and one without, especially because they're extra-detected. Yeah, I'm happy with that. As long as that's red as well. Yeah, which it is. Oh, Galak Ogh stars. I think you're right again there. Okay. G-dwar. G-dwar, sorry. That's all right. I think that's one of them out over here. Right. That's awesome. There you go. I saw it yesterday. Fantastic. Yeah. Absorption by Lymanal for a system again. So you're right there. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, there may be this beginning. Yeah, I think I should stick with option. Radio loud quasar again. Emission models definitely aren't. Why associated? No, we had a debate about this before. And I can't remember why I decided to mark associated. It means it's associated with some physical thing, but it doesn't mean it's spectral features. What's associated with option? It doesn't say it's associated with us. Is it in the process? I don't know. I've got no idea what it means. I'm happy to say M2. Absorption is a spectral feature. Yeah. So associated means it's associated to some physical thing. Yeah. Okay. That's what it means. And associated again. Those are mechanisms for that account. I just missed it. And we should have put emission line features, shouldn't we? Yeah, we should do. But we're not supposed to mark things but done differently. Yeah. We did that the same. But it's different from what we've been doing. We just talked about underlining features. You could actually mark it if it isn't altering what's in the manual. And it's only altering earlier rules. Yeah. And it's not altering. It doesn't say in the manual about features or not. But when we saw one previously, we marked features. Yeah. Then do, I think. Yeah. Yes. Anybody? It's then if we've both been not marking it, there might be other instances in the text where it's not marked. Yeah. But within the sentence that you're currently looking at, feel free to correct it that way. Do you like it's not only about resolution, but it's not like coming up with the corrected version. Right. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Do you've seen the other one, the quasar right here? Yes. All right. This is exactly the same as last one. And the system's. I am. It's a kind of a regular call. Yeah. Okay. Just put it in there. Sorry. How would you feel is being marked? Yeah. Absorption. Should be my. Yeah. I don't think able to ask is different from the cluster. Enable clusters. Yeah. That's actually marked explicitly in here not to have a ball cluster. Yes. Right. So, yeah. Soft access. That definitely gets to go in. That's not a component. Nope. Yep. Okay. I agree. It's a kind of blow. Yes. You're right. I think you're right. Yeah. Okay. Exhibio relax and radio relax. I think because the BL within should be marked. Yeah. I agree. That's fine. I want this one. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Seoluminosity. I think that's just a species again. Yeah. That is fine. Mm. That's not too hard. I can agree with taking that out. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. It's a region. That's so cocked. It shouldn't be highlighted to you, right? Yeah. I don't think it should be highlighted. Because it's a region. Talk about the borderline region. We're not supposed to highlight it. Yeah. It's just it's not a... Yeah. It's badly written. It's so cool. It's so cool. It's so red, galaxy, as we said. Not to mark things based solely on... So I just find only by wavelength. So we can't include them for red galaxy. Just galaxies. And... Starburst count? Yes, they do. Oh. Yes, assuming it took my starburst galaxy rather than starburst within a galaxy. But they are the first starburst galaxies, they are. And galaxies? And galaxies? Mm. Continue or continue flux. It's another one of those that doesn't really matter. I'd take into your flux, but they're obviously... Let's go ahead and look at it. In most of these cases we put flux in here. Yeah. Okay. I'm using this feature. Woodline. No, I'm happy to take that out. I was going to say it here. Oh. The lack of borderline polarization. Woodline polarization. It's a respectful feature. I think you don't want the whole thing to be said. Mm. You can't. You can't get just from a spectrum to it. But you kind of have a spectrum that's bit by... Yeah. Otherwise light. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think I would actually leave it with only......on those......broadly......line in it. I was thinking that's what you were happening to me earlier on. Yeah. Okay, great. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Okay. I don't know what was marked here. You got the bottom of this page. Nice. No, we're missing week......week line. I don't......uh......so they're saying week line radio galaxies are a separate class of radio. No. I said that week line was......because the modifier should be included, which I think it should. Even though week time radio galaxies......this should be underlined. This should be green. Okay. Or actually, sorry, I think the......this cut up page continues in the next......oh, it's okay. Are we the same on the bottom? Yeah. Characterized by......unsleigh. Okay, so the question is......oh. No, is it? Yeah, no, you've got line. It's a different to any week line. Oh, but line. That's fine. Line comes out and......and should come out as well....and should come out. Oh, yeah. So there's a line there. It's back. I think week line should be in. And an end. Okay. I'm not saying we'll have board line. It will be in there. Yeah. That's okay. Right. Do do do. Galactic black hole candidates. I just made that up. And gave it an acronym. H-C-V. Yes. That's not a source. Yeah. That's a source. A source. A source. Line again. We've got emission line and the loose heat. And for the red galaxies. Yeah. Oh, no, it's not right. Yeah. A source. A source. A source. A source. A source. A lesser sending will be in there. Let's say lightaren. I like how liner-minning gas sort of trace. Flan same. Cur shoes. Yeah. W-C-C camera on. Star-forming galaxy should be in. Uh, yes. That's what you did earlier anyway. Yeah, that should be. Protocol activity. No, they just made that up as well. It's a source type. Not for the early thinking. It's a lump. It's something. Emission feature again. Yeah. There's no absorption. That should be because it's not an absorbance absorption. No, but it says it's a composite. It's definitely small angular size. It's a physical thing. Yeah, it's a process. So... That's awesome. Yep, you cross- Stop the waves. Features. Yeah. Uh, feature again. This feature. Yeah, this is right. There's a feature, a special feature. No! You can't climb out. Yeah, you don't get that. Okay. Those are, those are regions, scrubs. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, and I should be in. Yeah. Extra- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We put in total implementation. We did. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That doesn't go in. That doesn't go in. Mm-hmm. Oh my gosh. Oh, it's just like... Oh, it's just like... It's like systems. And you don't like that one? And we don't like that one. And we don't like that one. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, hang on. Wasn't there one just an intergoing, which... Oh, you had a line. Yes, we are taking out a line on its own. All right, so we have... Yes. But you just... Yeah. Every time... Keeping lines there, keeping lines there. Yes, in general every time there's been line, there's been line. Okay, it's line width, but it's still, it's still, it's lines. We had any just where it says line ratios. We've been taking out line as a word, is it, relates to other words? Adjective. My head is goin'. Yeah. But lines are still lines. Okay. Yes, I think you're okay. Yeah, okay. Fine. Right. I agree that that's go out because that's a fitting thing. What the whole thing there are two features in the UV spectrum. Or in the UV, I don't expect there should be there. But if it's a wavelength or a wave band, we're putting it in. Okay. There's only one spectrum in the UV that you can see. Yeah. Right. There's a color. Yep, yeah. I'm right. I'm right. I'm here. I think I'm right. Line cent, you can point to. Not let line width. But you can put to line cent. In fact, the whole thing should be, I like what I think. Line cent. You can put to the line wings. You'd say line wings. I'll actually get it. That's just going to be a win. That's a twix thing. Yep. No, that should be a win. Yeah. Right there. You're a starburst. Starburst activity. That's a class. It's an action. Yeah, but then the ADN like it. Yeah. But it has to go. An ADN is a class. A starburst class. A starburst is a type of galaxy, but it's also something that can happen within a galaxy. As is an ADN. But an ADN is an object. A starburst, you can't say. But we're here with a starburst. A starburst galaxy. It means galaxy. If this means starburst galaxy like activity, that's... No, but a starburst galaxy is only a galaxy which has a starburst in it. Like an AEG. An active galaxy is just a galaxy with an AGN in it. But starburst refers to... From the linguistic side, if you mark starburst before and if you feel that starburst are like objects, then I think it should stay in the distance, even though it's modified by activity or it's modifying it to the edge. Okay, let's keep it down. I think you're right there. You're right there. You're right there. Yeah. I think it was... Maybe if it was star forming, I'd get to do it. Yeah, different. Yeah. Star formation we weren't putting in. Yes, that's right. But starburst is different. Okay. We've just got this split up. I think that should be... H... Your right is two. It's a wavelength region, but it's the same between that line and that line. Yeah. Okay. Um... I'm right here. You are, yes. Let's hope I can... Line ratios? Okay. These are the red galaxies. But galaxies should be in. But galaxies should be in. All right. Um, hold on. Oh, we're done. Oh, no, the other same. So, here's that. Silicon-9 systems. Hubble. And Hubble. And Galaxy. Yeah. Oh. Galaxy distribution. Still just the evolution of galaxies. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. Um... High ionization lines. We do it for the solar. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but it's... Yeah, it doesn't include the last prospect of... Quizars. Yeah, like couch. Lower ionization. Oh, week or three, it should be in. Yeah. Um. Lower ionization. Well, they're Lobals, aren't they? I mean. Lobel is a separate class of sorts. Okay. Yeah, that's true. I don't know, high bells are, but low bells are. They are. It's a big joke. Alright, yeah. Next. I shouldn't be right there. Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. Emission line candidates. That means objects that are identified as maybe a particular redshift. That doesn't count. Continuum, I think, should be in. Yeah, could you remember the message? Convenient flux should be in. We haven't been earlier, have you? But we heard. I don't remember about them in our series. We've been putting in continuum flux. Have you? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, we weren't doing broadband. Detections, what you were doing. Yeah. Nice team. Mind you. Now, what we're doing is radio lagquasar should be in. Zenn equals two shouldn't. And what we're doing is to leave it in, was it? No, because you're in language speak. Each conductor is a separate entity. That's different. Yeah, that's for things marked with and. Mark, subsections of entities. No, that's different. It doesn't mean saying. So we need to rule about. Is it good, again, or is it really z equals two? Z equals two means at a certain distance. So that shouldn't be in, but radio lagquasar is a thing. So it's whether to include the z equals two and. It was really loud, and you would mark it as one thing. I think it makes sense. I don't know what you. That's whatever is easiest for you. No, let's take it out. It's a respectful component. X-ray binaries. Probably field again. Mission nine objects should be either of them. Mediaquasar should be source time. Yeah, that's right. Now you don't want to knock the other. And you're right, because one's line formation and one's line profile. Oh. I'd yeah, I've done it again. This is nice and easy. Yeah. Components. Yeah. We can get rid of that, can't we? We want the lines to. The galaxy or galaxy? Give them the galaxy. It should be the galaxy. Whatever the word is. I don't know what HBC stands for, but since they're complexes we can cross-track. HBC, you see, you see. No, to lie in the direction of high velocity clouds. That's right. Nice, yes. That's an instrument. Sometimes anyone who works. You're right there. Should be this, and it probably is. No, you're right, and this should be read as well. It should all be. Oh, I see. Now I need you and I different. I missed that one. HBC to lie. I don't think that matters very much. Just keep HBC to I think, given that we're not putting line width at all. Even line width at all. You can have flux. HBC should be in. Nope, not that line, but we want enhanced. You wanted, and this is relative, we wanted modifiers of, what if I suspect lines, ED, weak board lines, but enhanced relative to what, weak work relative to what they, it's all relative, but it's still a modifier of that line. Okay. So sorry, the AGN, I think that should be one entity, right? Wasn't it according to the acronym rule, the first one? Yes, that's right. Mark the whole string is one entity for acronym. No, only when it's embedded. Oh, but the second one. Always included beside. Yeah. Mark it all is one entity. Yeah, that's right. I don't know how many times I missed that idea. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right. Weak mission. I think should be in there. Okay. Including emission. Are you? Yeah, extended emission. No, that's true. So we shouldn't have that on either of us. But then we think emission levels is just a way of saying, yeah. Nothing at all. Star first on completion. That's not a separate. Oh, yeah. So we're going to go into the next one. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. All right. We're going to go into the next one. Oh, yeah. Oh, no, it shouldn't. We weren't doing components. Oh, yes. Yeah. They mean photons in the lines escape. Not that that's not something. Yeah. That's true. So see you again. Continuum source. And associated. That should be. Wait, does it stem a fall observatory? Yeah. Is the C Tower four meter. That is a self that was. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. But it's also a telescope and I think if there's no other way of describing it that telescope. The CTIO for me to telescope this must be what it's called otherwise to call it a name The Planco actually usually We're including observatory if it's It is part of the property Yeah, I can't believe it. Yeah, yeah, yeah Oh no it should iron and absorption is it contamination from blended iron and absorption right? No It's the common wasn't there it will be in counting for the light of red man contamination from blended iron what they mean is Blended iron lines. Yeah, so they do mean And we're keeping line in strength Yeah continuum flux we should have all This is quick QSO I don't think that's a step for the class of quasar I don't know what that means I think you can climb an alpha to your cells It's not a source that's DAWD What's the DAW? WDS 25 of DAE type Yeah, it has hydrogen or helium in the atmosphere We're not supposed to be components No, it's a neither of them at all days or yeah No absorption Luminous People talk about them a lot but Yeah, I don't know luminous galaxies Yeah, so we should do I guess you should keep it then yeah People There are as much as ultra luminous galaxies No absorption We don't do that Oh And we Be cares that's the conjunction I appreciate it. It's great. It's something. It's a region. I shouldn't have done that. Yes, you shouldn't. Oh, A and B. And we... I'm sure we can do that. No, that's the conjunct rule. I'm right here, I think. Yes, you are, that's yeah. Strong soft x-wave drugs. Yeah, you can put it up there. That's associated absorption lines. Oh, right. In the AAL outflow. It's a year. That doesn't count. And absorption in small clouds. That doesn't count. Now this is the conjunct rule again. I didn't... Blue wings of this and this and this. Yeah. And this is one double line. And this. And presumably that's the bed there. Yeah, I don't know where. I think if the line's too long. Oh, I had one. And I apparently that's separate and it should be separate. Okay. What's this N thing? Because that is not marked in the... I think if the line's too long, it's only between the bottom line because Olivia would have marked from blue all the way to the end as one long line. No, sorry. I mean, so more than each other. The N's have the N as well. Yeah, I think it probably wasn't just as printed because Olivia wouldn't have started marking at 1402 lines above. Yeah, but I think it's just missing out the printing if the line goes over the end. Oh, I see. So your N... You look at what Olivia has done here. Yeah. Olivia wouldn't have just highlighted that line. Right. She would have highlighted the whole thing. Yeah. So N probably should be... So you're mostly setting for the solution where you mark all the conductivity. Yes. And it just hasn't printed that. Yeah. But it is marked, I think. Right. So opponents don't count. Continue on the source. Is that count? Shouldn't be. Shouldn't be. Oh, so it is. That's right. But is that also the name of the source? Yeah. So it should be this one plus the pink. Yeah. So I think that's it. That's a way of saying line width, though, and we don't mark line width. That's true. Okay. Yeah. So we've been in here. Let's go take a moment. Rich iron spectrum. You probably write to the feature of the spectrum. Does that make it a spectral feature? Something that you can point to a write or a write? Well, kind of. It's, I think you had a suspect. We have all the lines of actually lots of different elements. I only have to work out all the ones with your iron lines. Then after that, you look and say, has a lot of iron in it. And to think through the whole spectrum, you can't see there was a rich iron spectrum. So that's it's like a derived problem. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not a spectral feature, it's a picture of a spectrum. It's different. It should go in. Yes. And then we're the same. Okay. Shall we get a few of this now? Yeah. I don't know. Are giant ellipticals separate those? Yeah. They are separate, but they are separate class. I think they probably are in the ECEP-TG. That's my little gas. I don't get in. Iron-ized emission. If you're doing emissions from high. Yes. You want iron-ized in there. Really? Really? Well, you can point to iron-ized emission rather than. She was allowed emission from high excitation, what not. Emission from high excitation lines. Yeah. That's exactly the same as. They're saying there's a high excitation emission. And there's non-high excitation. Okay. If you both think so. Yeah. Well, I'm not certain if high excitation should go in, but if high excitation should go in, I think iron-ized means the same thing. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Line ratio. Yeah. It's right. Oh, there I go. Yeah. It's a racehorse. R117. Now we're lying to see that one should all be one with the red inside it. Mm-hmm. What? That's... That's... That's... That's... That's... That's... That's... That's... That's... That's... That's... That's... That's... That's... This is describing the band who do the observations. Subscribe to the line you're looking for. Yeah. Yeah. Like cats? I think so. We've included it before when you've said this has been detected. Right. Right. Yeah. That... Form the... I think should be in there. Yeah. Okay, emission. Yep. Okay. Quiz on as a next. Ooh, those shouldn't be there, should they? No. Compliment is not systems. Yeah. Oh, okay. Okay. Well, hang on though, but... Is it just... Just... Just... Just grab your mechanism there. It is in turn. It's going to be a chair, side. No, I think it's a respectful feature. You can point to the Dampclimin of absorption. In the same way you can point to HP to emission, although HP to emission is a process. I think this is what we agreed to cross out before, is it? No, Dampclimin of absorption systems, we crossed out. Mm-hmm. We also crossed out... Having a process. I think it's a process too. I think... Especially when they're saying we're choosing low redshift. Absorption. That's not... Really deep at point too. You can point to low redshift, Dampclimin of absorption, because you're shifting the spectrum there. Mm-hmm. Not too fast, I don't think. Would it be if it was HP to absorption? And you just took out the low redshift. Quizars with HP to absorption, you had to put in. No, I'm not sure. Because it's a respectful feature. I think Dampclimin of absorption. That's whether it's a process or a feature. I don't think it's both. I think it's a very important example for what we've done before. Because we've... Maybe feature is produced by a process. If it was absorption in Dampclimin of clouds, you'd not mark absorption. Yes, it depends on what it means with low redshift, Dampclimin of a cloud absorption. If it was Dampclimin of absorbers, that would be different. But I think absorption... I do think it's a process, I think. It's a process, but it also produces a spectral feature. Where you can say there's the Dampclimin of absorption. Yeah, well, that's true. In the same way that... HP to emission is a process. We've both marked it. I think it should be in there. Microquizars. They're dubbed microquizars. Yeah, that means it's new found. Is it going to be a decent source type in the future? I haven't heard that with 30 cents. Yeah. But just talk about the microquizar. Yeah, but they've made up that one. Yeah, I think you're right. They have me. On the other hand, if we're having hyperluminous galaxies, where they've just gone over luminous and all even more hyperluminous. Yeah. Well, someone must have made that up for the first time. But what defines a microquizar? I'm saying there's a hyperluminous galaxy being very, very extreme. I guess keep it from there. Yeah. I reckon a dwarf amorphous nuclei starboard galaxy. I've made that one. A dannus. I study a dwarf amorphous nuclei starboard galaxy. Do we say we take that out? Yeah, okay. But what about the acronym? That should be in. Starburst nuclei. The object. If it was starburst galaxies, it would be in there. Starburst nuclei refers to a region with an object which would not be observed separately. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what happened also, you found that dwarf amorphous galaxies that's not a proper name, but you still include the acronym? Because the acronym has starburst galaxies in it, and yes. And if the acronym included it. All right. Okay. That has to be in there. Continuing flux you have. UV and optical emission line. Mises. But. I think all of that goes in this. We wouldn't have line ratio. UV and optical emission should be in there though. No, it shouldn't. No, not as much as ratios. Yeah. Oh gosh. No emission. Okay. So I highlighted this in red and then the whole thing in green. Because type 2 super galaxies are one. Yeah. That's right. As long as this is. TV, camera, emission. We weren't doing work done. We weren't doing work done. Work done. Using the people. That's definitely an instrument. Very stupid but it is. Right. You're right there. FBS objects shouldn't be in there. What does it mean? I don't know if it's got objects. Yeah. You're right. And the mama scanning machine is. It's an instrument. It's not a telescope but it's an instrument. It's not a telescope. The other one we stopped after four meters. Oh yes, it should be. No emission lines are high. We did it this way before. Absorption features. We continue. Yeah. Continue radiation. No. Neither. Redial emission. Ooh. That's emissions from the now and now. Yeah. No. No. No. No. No. Yeah. White force is a source type. A filo balance source type. Yeah. You're right. Stupid that maybe unkeckers. You used a... It's like observatory. Yes, we did decide keckers. We're going in. We didn't allow iron spectrum so we shouldn't allow H or helium to expect from either. Yeah, that's right. At all. And we shouldn't allow emission. Yeah. So electronic. Yeah. Oh, no, radio loud and radio quieter. But radio closed. It means radio loud. It does. Yeah. UV access is all right. We weren't doing fast spectrum. No. I think no set book to us. Yes, we're not putting them in spec. Right. I think we are putting them in because it's a board band. But yes, they are set foot. All right. You're right there. White strength. No. You can't point it. I missed group. So if we would tell us, get the right. That's it. Hey. It's under a proper name because it's got a capital T. Yeah. Very good. All right. Wonderful. Under two hours. Excellent. Well, once we've got them identified, a lot of them were the same problem going around and around. What's the bin in here? And what is the point? Can I get to it without? No. I can carry in my little bits of wire with me. Excuse me, Camber. I'm just trying to bin. And there was one is there. Do we need to remain wired up? I think that's it. I think so. Yeah. We're done. Excellent. Okay. Okay. I will start with that.
