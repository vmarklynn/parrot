 you you you you you you you N as It's the same as on the top of it with the round like this one. But we do think it's what it is for. Which prefers the customer. I think this is the device which has a learning curve. Not for users. Users device as normal users use remote control. And after a while they start to develop some skills in the voice recognition functions. And then they will not use this dial as often. But other users who are new to this device need something like that. They need to understand how to change channels and change the volume. So it's easier for them. Could I see this crowbar as a sort of shortcut? Yeah maybe so. And voice recognition as well. Maybe you could. Wow it's another approach. It's more that are as I feel back in the room. There are many ways of doing things on such a device. Yeah. It's quite easy. Okay good. And the case is rubber. Yes rubber. And the buttons. Plastic or rubber. Plastic or rubber. Oh yeah. Okay. And the coloring yellow with gray or black. Or something like that. Whatever cost the least. Okay we'll come to that later. Okay. Anything else to add or? No. Maybe we should think about these buttons. Yeah. Or you could use two of them to program the channels on the two channel button. But these are tasks that are only executed once I think. Yeah. But maybe you do want to program buttons to for example activate the voice recognition or train the voice recognition. Oh okay. That's right. Or something on the button for disabling the voice recognition. Yeah although by pressing the button for I don't know two or three seconds you could also say you disable it with a little beep. Yeah. Okay that's not really really important. This is the basic idea. The basic. Okay. For prototype. Okay. You thought of some evaluation criteria? Yes. Okay. My name is not the name. You are nameless. You are nameless. Well I use the earlier documents. And these are the most important criteria. That's how the fashion guy is stated. Fancy look and feel. So just walk through it step by step. I mean it's fancy. Everything I believe. I believe it's fancy. I believe it's fancy too. But apparently we shouldn't evaluate it yet. Oh. Okay. So these are the criteria. I think these are the most important criteria. Okay. Well. So that's about it. Then we'll switch to my presentation. The prediction costs. The costs are not under. Can I? Aww. This is the. 22. Yeah. It's way above the 12 year of 50. And what makes it very expensive is for example the solar cell. So I guess we should skip that because it's not that important. Okay. What is the price? And the price. Yeah. The number of items and the sum. Well this is what I would call our luxury model. If you look at the what we could do to make it more to make it just between the 12 year of 50 then I did the following changes. 12 euro 40 cents I came up with by leaving out solar cells by not using the voice recognition feature because it's a four euro addition to the price. Yeah. I believe. Push button. Well. It makes it 13. Yeah. Push buttons are not the most expensive but do at extra cost. So yeah this design is not within our price model. Okay. But I'm afraid it's not complete because we use special materials. The last item. You have not added one item there. Yeah. So it's way too expensive. It's still too expensive. Yeah. But that's only for the buttons. I guess if we leave the if we leave this one out. And maybe not use a special form. And a plus and just plus button. So instead of rubber. It becomes a very dull remote control. I know. But it's the board decision. And yeah. Well basically when this is our only option we should even consider changing the casing because I think there's very little added value in an enhanced case with these dual functions. Yeah. I know maybe we should look at a focus on another type of movement. Yeah. Not all that fancy but just way way more easy. Basic. Yes. And maximize the profit. And that's maybe that's better. Yeah. Maybe we could we should go for straight and simple. Yeah. But that's not what has been asked. I know. I know. So we should kick the boards. Well. Yeah. Although I think we could still make a remote control that applies more to young people by giving it another color already. So it is possible to make a device that attracts a little bit more to young people. Yes. But I agree it's not a fancy high tech device. Definitely not. It's not that innovative or however you pronounce that. So, okay. Oh, this is the wrong one. So that means redesign. We do not have the time now to redesign the product. But we can evaluate the process and the satisfaction on how things went. I'm not sure if we need to evaluate the device first. I guess. Well, since we're not going to manufacture it anyway. Yeah. That's true. Well, maybe it's good to do it anyway. Because if we can also determine if our objectives are good. Yeah. So. I agree. Well. Is it fancy? It is. It is. Yeah. I think it's a rubber. You like the rubber at all. I'm into it. So, one. Yeah. That's not that fancy. No, I'll give it a two. I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing. The casing. It would be. You like that. I'm into it. That's a flavor as well. It has flavor. Yes, that's right. But you taste it. Right. Yeah, I know. But that's fancy in the way. I mean, fancy has a lot of. It has to do with fashion, I guess. Yeah. So, do we. It's trendy. Yeah. What they wanted was colors and soft materials. So, in that way. It applies. Yeah. It's fancy. I'll just give it a two. Yeah. Right. I think it's not the ultimate thing. It's not the ultimate thing. It's not the ultimate thing. It's not the ultimate thing. But I would have been more fancy by using the double curved case. It would have been even more fancy. But we decided not to because if we use double. Yeah, but that's the case. We couldn't use solar. So looking at the user needs, we only don't have the double curved case. We do have the rubber. We do have the colors. There's two out of three. Yes. So, I believe we're close to two. Yeah, I agree. Yes, I agree. It's okay. We did good. Yes, we did good. Okay. And what is it? Inevitive. Well, with the voice recognition feature. And it's over. Or can we? No, we are evaluating this design now. This prototype. I think it is. I think it's innovative. Yeah. In the scroll wheel, the solar, not many remotes have the solar, I think. It could have been a little bit more innovative by using the kinetic energy source. But it's what it would have been a thrill. Yes. Also, I think it's a two. Is it easy to use? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Well, yeah, the voice recognition, of course, is hard to learn, I think. Well, hard. It's not for the elderly. They won't use it. There are two parts in this remote control. What you see here is the basic part. Everybody can use it. So that's easy to use. That's for another user. When you have a more advanced level of users, well, such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions. In that way, it is advanced. I think it's easy to use for both types of users. I think it's not very easy for you. I think it's free. Wouldn't give it more. I'm doubting as well. The most important function is easy to use. The zapping, channel switching, volume. But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder. Okay. Two or three, what would be your guess? I mean, ease of use does not only apply to the most basic functions. It's overall. It's the device easy to use. That's right. You're right in that. But I guess an advanced user will find the voice recognition function easy to use. Because he is already, she is already an advanced user. Personally, I would give it two. Okay. At all, three. Yeah. Good question. I'll go for the two. Okay. Two, two, and three. Two-free. So I could make it easy. So that will be three in general. No, two and a half. If you make a four. No, six and four. Six and four is ten. And by four is two and a half. So darn. May. Yes. But all. Seven, three. No. Four and a three together. Four. Yeah. You have a two. Two, three. Three. No, I haven't said anything yet. May. I know. Okay. But if I would say a three, then it's six and four is ten. Divided by four. Divided by four is two. Yeah. If you want to have the conclusion as a three, then you would make a four. If you fill out a four. But I'm filling in a three, so it will be a 2.5. But that's not possible to fill in. Yes, it is. So we have to run. I have a veto. Exactly. It's not about the content. It's about... Okay. Is it easy to find? Yeah, definitely. Yes. Yeah, we haven't really worked it out, but it most doesn't... You can just say find and he repeats find. Yeah, or beeps or... Yeah, but that's the basic idea of the speaker. I think. I'm here. I'm here. Something like that. Maybe you have to program it once to let it respond to a certain word or a sentence and something like... Even without it. Where are you? And then it will sing, I'm here. Yeah. So something like that. We should not stay too long on this subject because of the time. Yeah. But I personally give it a one. Sebastian? Yeah, me too. Me too. Yeah, I think. Right. Well, the feel of remote control is spongy. Well, it can't be more spongy. Well, it can be. There are cases in which the outside casing can be... Is this one of our... One of our options. No, it's not one of our options. No, okay. This is when you're looking at the market. For your options given, it's the most points you want. Yes, but that's not what they're talking about, I think, because we compare all these characteristics with markets, with the real market. So there are remote controls out there, which are a lot more spongy. They're out there. In this case, we've done the best we could. Yes. But it's not good enough, so it's a tool. I'll give it a one. I'll take one. You'll take one? What do you give it? Oh, yeah, it depends, because it's the most spongy we can... Yeah, I know, but you have to name it, because we need to go on for the time. Well, if I give it a one, it will be a one- No, we want health calculations. So I'll just give it a two and make this a 1.5. No, no, no. I'll change it. I'll make it... My mark will be a four. You are... Okay, the remote control offers enough features. Well, Root, what do you think about it? Well, the basic layout doesn't offer much, but the voice recognition could add a lot. So... Basically, it's completely programmable. You can add very much functionality by using the voice recognition mode. Yeah, I know. It's quite a sense. What we didn't talk about is... Yeah, but it doesn't have the digits. I believe it's... If you ask yourself, it offers enough features, I don't think it has all the features a normal remote has. I think it has. It depends on what you implement. Plus we didn't talk about it, but you do have remote controls that are able to adapt another signal. So you place a regular remote control in front of the other one, hit the one or the two or the three, whatever, and it records the series... The signals. The signals. So you could enter any comment you like. As long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal. So I think this is remote control with very high level features. Absolutely. Although there are a few buttons, but the inside is quite... That's it. Power, I guess. Because a regular programmable remote control contains, well, really a lot of buttons, at least 40 buttons. So it's quite complicated to get used to. And this is quite simple. You can use your voice to program it. Okay. Let's give it a number. I'll give it a one. For this type of market, I think it's a one. I'll give it a two. I'll give it a one. I think a one, because with the voice recognition you could add anything you want. That's like... Yes. I think we've succeeded in developing a product that's actually quite good, but not for this kind of market and not for this kind of price. Yeah. So high quality, low acceptance. The product has high quality and is advanced, but whether or not our clients are willing to pay 25 euros for this kind of device is not sure. Do you agree? Yes, I agree. I mean, even because it doesn't look advanced. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we should have a radar function. Couldn't... What's the selling price? 50? 25 euros. 25. And costs were 12.50. But even now, if only our production costs were exceeded, the double, I think, production costs were 22. So selling price would be about 50 euros. Yeah. That's quite expensive. It's not very expensive for remote control that... No. It has this functional remote control of any TV kind, a Philips remote control. You pay more than 50 euros. It's quite expensive. Yeah. And I know from a few years ago, it was a hundred kilos. Well, yeah, I know. But you're paying for the brand because there are remote controls which control your stereo, television, DVD, CD player. Yes. 25 euros. Yes, but you can learn this thing, all these functions. And it's easier to use because those remote consoles don't offer voice recognition. This one does. So I think it's worth its price. Okay. You had an overall rating. Yeah, but... That's counting. These ratings. Yeah. Well, it's about... It should be about 1.15. So something like that. Yeah. Okay. Okay. We'll go further on with the rest of the evaluation. About the project itself, not about the product. What did you think about the process, the project process? Ruth. Yeah. Try to translate that. Any other... I think... Okay. The process was good. But we weren't aware of the prices of the cost. And that was in the big deal. If we knew that before, actually we could have made the choice between... Better decisions. Yeah. We had too little information actually. And while looking at room for creativity, the choice of components was way too narrow. So that was not really a process of... So we could have been creative, but it was tempered by the choice of components and... Yes, the price. The price. Well, in the first meeting, we already were very creative. We thought of possibilities who are not possible with the occurrence or of manufacturing components. So... Yeah. We're tempered by that, yes. Okay, rule. Any other thoughts on that? No. No. Ruth. I agree. You agree. Okay. Leadership. Fantastic. Okay. Rules on for his promotion. Yeah. Yeah. Is it okay? Okay. I think we're a good team. I think so too. It's, of course, a laboratory environment. I missed it to be able to contact you in between. And say, I'll... I tried once, but it was not allowed. Yeah. So... Yeah, but... When taking in account the situation, I think we performed pretty well. I think so too. Yeah. The means. The smart board, the digital pen, did you like them? The digital pen was okay, but the smart board was really bad. Yeah. Because of the response or... The response is very slow and the possibilities are very limited. It's not accurate. Okay. It has... yeah, yeah. It's not accurate. The pointing of the pen is not the place where it writes... Where it draws? Yeah, where it draws. It's the drawing on the board is right from the pen. Okay. So it had to be... You have to take that line. There are lines. Or what's the word? Yeah. Yeah. Maybe it needs to be calibrated. It was calibrated just before this means. The one before the third meeting. Okay. So it's not the calibration. It's the thing itself. Okay. I think. Ruit, did you use the pen a lot? Not at all. Not at all. Not really? Okay. I thought it was quite a handy thing. I think so too. Although I would like to see OCR. Yeah. Yes. If it has OCR, I think I would use... I just took notes for myself and that's it. It was necessary for me to... To digitize them. Yeah. Because if I want something on the computer, I just typed it. I typed faster than the other right. But I think it's a great solution for a gnome problem. Writing down some notes, some information. And then forgetting your notebook somewhere. And losing all that information. Because you have everything in one place. And it's quite easy, quite easy. It's possible to make this information digital. I share it with others. Yeah. Quite easy way. I think it's a good product. I only think the shape of the pen is too big. Yeah. It's not quite an anomis. Economic. Er-genomis. I know. Yeah. Okay. Erm... What... Ruit, what did you think about the smart boards? Oh, I only use it to draw a rabbit. Yeah. Okay. You can't really decide. I missed a feature to easily select a slide and distribute it to the laptops. I think that would be very easy if you could say, okay, I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or... Or the other way around. Or the other way around that you could show. But quite what PowerPoint does. I know. If you save this image, you can open it in your shared work folder. I know. So it's almost... I know. But we couldn't use that feature. So I missed it. Yeah. We weren't able to do that. At least I wasn't explained how to do such. You know, and the function of filling an oval or an object. The drawing... It's not... Capabilities are very limited. Yeah. Okay. And when you're using windows, you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons which you can use for drawing. Yeah. And a lot of these buttons don't appear here. So... That looks like a paint. Okay. So it's not even as advanced as paint. Not... Not... It's quite limited. Okay. No. Yeah. The project is evaluated. But, well, we need to redesign the product. Oh, very good celebration. So... It's a... It's a privilege for working with you. You're dismissed. No, I think we are ready. Okay. Two private rooms? I see some action over there. Private room, at all. That sounds quite scary. Okay. Now, let's find out the way to... They don't want to do this. There. That was... We're done. We're finished. I believe. So... Are there any more cycles in this process? I think not. I don't believe so. Well, maybe we get an email. Thank you for your... But how much time did we get for this meeting? Fourteen minutes. And how much time is left? A minute or ten, maybe? Ten minutes. Yeah, ten or five. Okay. Okay. Okay. So we can redesign our... I would like to... Well, I think we all know what the redesign should be. A simple, built, one-colored box. No added value. No, it's just the same product that is already on the market. You see the problem? Yeah. You can continue your line. Well, it's fluffy, all right? Spongy. What is that? Giraffe. Giraffe eating leaves from a tree. It's blue tongue. Interesting design. Yeah. This is a new model. So you're actually promoting Bluetooth or blue tongue? Blue tongue. But it does have a natural feeling. So... It's spongy. Yeah. Opa. That is... It's a new feature next to Bluetooth to disable all Bluetooth devices. Okay. Right. Let's wrap it up. Yeah. We're done here. Gentlemen, thank you for your cooperation. Thank you, Mr. Manager. Now, let's have a bottle of champagne. All right. Let's give it here. Yes. That's it, mate. No, it's not. It's very good. Mate, it's a microphone. It's an all-tinger. It's a nice one.
