 Oh, how do you find? What's the doer? Doo doo doo doo Transmitter transmitter Transmitter No! Finche, eh? If you don't see here Like a little box? So I can just shoot off, take... I also stood What? What? Please. JBL on the wall JBL on the wall Blah, no! I don't know, is it okay? Do I am? Mm, I'm wearing that cute No, no, no He's hitting it Get the Me? Oh, that's it I can turn down, maybe the Yeah, I'm on the part. You should speak in with me. You look far. I can't hear all this going like... Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello there little friend. Hello. Halle. Hello. Hello. Sorry. Toh. Artistic. Artistic. A tree. Happy Tree Frats. Okay. Welcome everyone to our next meeting. next meeting, I'm busy writing and busy leading the meeting, but I've prepared a little presentation. Once again, or at least an agenda, I think the biggest part of the presentation will be on your side. We are here at the conceptual design meeting, which is hereby opened. Once again, I will try to write some minutes, which I just, from a previous meeting, placed inside our project folder, which was quite some typing. Today, we once again have three presentations, if I'm right. And after that, we will take a decision on the remote control concept, and just as the last time we have 40 minutes to accomplish that. Okay, well, let's start with the first presentation in the same order as last time. Okay, I'll take it away. Bling. Okay, and welcome. You all. Compartment design. First of all, I'd like to accommodate some of those things. I'll elaborate some of the things I did. I'll elaborate it on the concept. What should be said about the components, its properties, and what kind of material we use to make one of those remote controls. First of all, I've subtracted some of the components that are used from what the remote control has formed. First of all, the case, the case, the surrounding of the remote control. I would like to give you an idea of how I thought about doing this through which one. I'm sure I was going there. Okay, the case is made from rubber, I suppose, because when you use remote control, a lot of people will drop their remote control in the break, because the titanium was also an option, but it's a very expensive material. Rubber is, I think, the best suitable material to use for remote control. It's also possible to create fancy colors with rubber. Rubber makes it easy to let itself color. Titanium, you have to paint it, and with that it's possible to scratch it or make it ugly. Rubber, the total piece of rubber that's used to make the case is the same color, so if you scratch it, it's still the same color. Perhaps it's a little bit damaged, but it's a very strong material. I had an idea, it's single curved, sorry, it's single curved, so it's two-dimensional. I think it's best to draw a green. It's a color. A brush color. A new forward blank. Okay. I thought of an idea like this. That's that. Blank. Okay. It also looks nice when it's on your table. It doesn't lay flat down on the table, but it stands. It's a size few. I'm not technically good at 3D modeling. It's just an idea I had, so it's also looks nice when it's on the table. The graphical user interface and the buttons, we also thought about that already. I thought about the LCD touchscreen, which is easy to clean too. I thought it was a great advantage of the LCD screen to just use some ClosX or another cleaning stuff. It should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright. I already explained some properties of that material. I think we also almost concluded about that. This should be our two-button component. That's all about the buttons. The batteries we also thought about that already will be chargeable with an option for a mount station, so you can put the remote control in a mount station so it charges itself up instead of plugging it in or something like that. Questions? No, no, no. It should be empty in about two minutes or 30 minutes or 40 minutes of use. Next step is the chip, the component that makes or transmits the signal to the television. There was an option to use a rather simple chip, but I think because of our highly requiring requirements, there should be an advanced chip in it and also the ability to facilitate speech recognition, which unfortunately is still in a test phase. There should be some more investigation on that side. My personal preference is also overheard in the last meeting that we should use our own business colors. That was correct, wasn't it? I think they are rather boring for use with rubber. Well, business colors, I thought it was the slogan and the corporate image. They should be in mind, wasn't it? But I don't think you have to make the entire thing in there. Okay, so it doesn't says to have the slogan. It's very recognizable. Okay, okay, well, that's possible, of course. You could make a little R&R on the top of the machine. So, they are pretty boring, I suggest because of the availability with rubber to make fantastic colors and also in a lot of possible colors. So, it's possible to make very fancy remote controls, which people, in which people will find their interesting. And we'll buy faster when they look at the same old grey or black colors. As I said before, rubber is impossible to damage severely. Instead of, of course, you can break it when you break it. For example, with a pair of scissors or something like that. But if you drop it, it's not broken right away instead of using plastic, or hard plastic or titanium. And I personally liked the single curved remote control because it makes it fancy. Okay, well, that's all about my findings. Okay, thank you. I will go next. All right, so I saw a little bit about the interface. I should look. We determined that there will be no buttons, but only on the LCD screen. So, I had to look on that. And the design is therefore based on what we just thought of. First, there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition. And this is that you give a question through the device. And it answers you. And they already put this in a coffee maker. And so that you say, good morning coffee maker and it says to you back, good morning, Joe, or what's your name? There's an easy way to program that. You say record into the device, into the speaker, and then you say the question and three seconds later, you say the answer, and then when you say the question, it gives you the answer. Perhaps it's useful, because people lose the remote, they can yell remote. Where are you? And that's the goal or something. That's true. Perhaps we could implement that. And then I have to go out of the presentation because I tried to make some kind of idea of how to do plaque, but I can draw, so don't. I don't watch your head. I tried to the LCD screen, I tried to draw. I thought at least the icon for the volume. I don't know if there's an icon for the program, but. No, just P. So, and then the buttons above and below. The mute button also very nice, but there's an icon. Where's the button for two digits? I forgot that one. I thought I forgot something. And the numbers, it should be a bit larger, I think. It's not really on scale and so forth. An options button. And I thought that the button for the teal text apart, because it's not really options, I think. Options is the settings of the remote and of the TV and that kind of thing. You could call it settings or something. But this is a bit how I thought. And the LCD somewhere on your remote, perhaps you could be more curvy to remote. So that it's better in your hand or something. And microphone for the speech recognition if you want to implement that. And then if you press the options button, then we have an example of, and then you should get the other options with what you could do with something like this. And it's also, I think we discussed earlier that older people don't really want to use these extra settings. And older people also don't really want to use this kind of option we use. So they want to use one button and then something happens and not choose with this kind of option. And you could put a little scrolling device on the side of your remote so you could scroll across these things. That's an option. That was my finding thing. Thanks. No, no Danny. Okay. I'm going to tell you something about the trend watching. The trends from the past years, what people like, what the youngsters like, what the only people like about shapes, colors, material and stuff. The minute I use was, like I told, I watched the trends from past years about color shapes, material they wanted from elderly and young people. So you can keep that in mind for designing the device itself. Finally I made the most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look fancy. The second important thing that should be innovative, like the LCD screen is quite innovative. So that should be a great meeting for this. And the third thing is it should be easy to use. I think with only one menu for button channel volume, it should also be enough for easy to use. The personal preferences for the young people, they liked fruity colors like banana yellow, strawberry red and stuff. Grass green. Yeah. Like that. The round shapes and soft materials, materials like the rubber, it should be soft, it should be feeling spongy or a spongebob like this. That's really interesting. Elderly people like colors which are being seen in autumn like wood, dark brown, deep red and stuff. They like square shapes with round edges and hot materials like wood, titanium, those kind of materials they liked. This is a bit like the young people's like, the fruity colors, innovative, all the colors you see, the blue, the red, the white, yellow, that stuff. And then I personally thought a front side of the shape should be something for the young people's like this or something. It's a bit like banana and the color should be yellow or something. And for elderly people just plain old because we decided to have two kind of remotes to designs or was it two colors? Different colors, yeah. We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes. I think like my colleague, you said, is that better or for the elderly people something like the iPod or something with round squares. Simple but easy to use. So that's it. That is nice. Some people are more traditional, like the older colors. You could change your colors, but also the yellow. I don't know which shape you should take. The color's the yellow. Yeah, I guess changing colors will be easier than changing. Change the shape of the image. Perhaps you could find something in the middle. Round squares. Round corners, but square, yeah. Maybe then both groups won't buy it. If you do it square with round corners, but in the middle of it. Yeah, I know what you mean. Kind of like a... Yeah, whatever. Like this. Yeah. So it's a bit square, but it's also a bit... Kind of like a beer glass. So, but then... I know what you mean. Same size. It's also easy to put in your hand. Yeah, but it's also how other remotes are shaped. So that's a good thing. So that's easy to use. People know that. We'll recognize that as a remote control. What I saw in your... Look, something like that. Out of colors, like red, brown. They like the wood a lot. Maybe we could give it like a wooden look or something. Kind of old colors. A bit old school style. Red, sun, medieval colors. It's all together. Those kind of things. So you see the big difference between the young people. Fresh, exciting, and old people. So that's easy to do with color. So, sorry? That's easy to do with the color. Yeah, I think it's easier to do in color than in shape. Otherwise, we have to get different shapes. And colors are way easier than shapes. And material, yeah, rubber. Rubber is, like I said, young people like more soft materials, and spongy ones, and the old people like plain wood. So we have to decide if we're going to use really hard rubber or soft rubber or something. Something we can see in that. Also in between. Soft rubber, which you can feel in. I don't think you should promote it. Or what should not be on the next question. No, no, but you have to like erase or something. That's a bit you can press it in or something harder. But like this kind of rubber. Yeah, something like this. This is quite hard. Yeah, it's quite hard, but you can press it in. It feels kind of spongy. Spongy. Something. No, think it's rubber. No, no, no. So we need a spongy feeling. If you have spongy. We're going to infact spongy, but maybe you can. So we should first decide about shape, I think. Yeah, I think it's the better thing to do. Then you can fit the LCD screen in it. Oh, Moses. I'm going to start with that. I also can't help but notice. As you used, you had a remote control, but the LCD screen was rather small. I think the LCD screen should be larger. But I think it should be larger. Yeah, three quarters. So you don't have to put your buttons. But it won't get that small. What LCD screen is. So when you get this. Can I like this? Or should it be larger? Larger, I think. Larger? Because you want to put your hand. Yeah, because you can't put your hand there. And then you won't touch the screen. Okay. True, true, true, true. You're thumb here. But not on the screen. Because when you put your... Yeah, but if you make the LCD screen as large as the remote control itself, you always get some... You always touch it. You're going to be very greasy and stuff. But it won't get that small because you have how much? 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 buttons on the screen. 1, 2, 0. You don't want it to take it too small. Yeah, how large? You have to... Because some fat people would think fingers. I think you're just three buttons. So you're going to... Well, if you want to make it international, Japanese people get rather small hands. Yeah, true. But we would love... Yeah, we have the zoom option. Right? The zoom option? Of course. Yeah. You can make it larger with accompanying a greater field to push the button. Yeah. And we won't include a pen or something to point. I think we won't do her fingers. Yeah. Your fingers. Because you lose a pen. You lose a pen. You lose a pen. You can't use... You can't use... Yeah. Yeah. They think it's handling the use pen. Yeah. I think this is a good size for the screen. I don't know how large the actual remote should be. Maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all that. Yeah, but that can be a good point. Any soft glove. Yeah. You can buy those. If I can interrupt you, maybe I should show some points on which we should take a decision. Sure. So we can discuss these points. There are those points. Energy question mark. How should we supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do a separate docking station and then put a cues in it. Chip on print and case. Those are points my coach advised me to discuss here. But I hope you have ideas about them. I think you were batteries and then... The docking station. Yeah. So that's the first point we'll include rechargeable batteries which you can recharge through docking station. Yeah. So if two batteries are dead. I kind of like your... Change them. Hey, you got some of those wireless mice. Yeah. Computer mice. There you go. Kind of like those kind of batteries. Yeah. But it should be, I think, normal batteries. Not like to... Yeah, normal plane. Normal plane batteries. Yeah. You can buy the supermarket or rechargeable. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And what was with the chip on print? The chip on print. You got... Yeah. I think so. Chip on print with a... With a... Simple... Not a simple but... We also discard that, didn't we? Yeah. How does that work with LCD screen? You still have a... Print... Yeah. You always have a print plate. Thank you, Juan. You always have a print plate light. Yeah, sure, of course. Always. So... I don't know what we have to decide about that. Yeah, well, it's a good question. It was in there and I didn't... Chip on print, I think what I mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got, it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button. But when you got an LCD screen... Yeah, okay. With no... With not... The buttons are not always on the same place. For example, if you enlarge a button, or if you got several options appearing on your screen, then the code donations aren't always the same. When you get a regular button, the button of standby is always on the same place. Yeah, but... And you get on a print plate of LCD screen less more advanced than a normal print plate. So that's not of any discussion, I think. No, you need some kind of CPU, I guess. I suppose so. I don't know. I don't think... It is a simple CPU, but it is... Yeah, okay, but I don't know if... Yeah, because it has to be... It's quite a simple LCD screen. I think the only... The remote control has to know where you're in the settings menu or just... You just want to turn on the volume. Yeah, okay, true. True. True. True. So it has to have some kind of... Calculation unit or CPU... To know in which state you are and which button you are pressing it at the right moment. Because we're projecting the buttons on the LCD screen. And the touchscreen makes it possible to get coordination of your finger on the screen. In the case, yeah, we already discussed the case, so we wanted to make it from rubber. But it's a hard rubber like this or a softer rubber. A hard rubber, I think. That's easy to add to that. Yeah. It bounces back from the floor where you... We have different colors. Yeah, this is a little show. The shapes is something between square shapes with round corners and round shapes. No, I don't think. I think it's more routes than square. Yeah, it's a bit... I think it's a bit longer. I think it meets more the young people than the older people. Yeah, but that's what we wanted. Yeah, that's our target. It's our main target. Yeah. Load it for the years, I think. Well, and how about my idea of making it with one single curve? Oh, yeah, that's cool. I think I thought that was quite good. Because it's a gadget and you want to show it off, of course. Yeah, you have a fancy design right away. You can put it on your table with LCD screen. You don't have to put it in your head. You can put it next to you and then, then, then, then, it will... Yeah, that's cool. It's not easier. Yeah. So, you can write that down and get a single curve. Rubber. Fancy colored. You can't remote control. You can't... Or you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the... Yeah, you can... Yeah, but I don't understand. And load it on the user, the server. And about the user interface, there are also some... Some questions about the concepts. I think you have some ideas. Yeah, I... You showed your drawing. I should go through it again. I missed a few buttons. At least... You should also have... I just remembered a menu to go back through the first... But if you touch options, you can go back to the... You can go back to this right away now, this... Isn't it better to have the sound and the channel buttons horizontal? I don't know. With the minus and the plus. I think it's... I don't know. I thought it was easier to handle this way, but I don't know what they think. That's right. Would you like the buttons horizontal or vertical? Or south and... It turns on the screen, if you make the screen vertical, it doesn't matter. If you make it in a rectangle... If we make it like this... I think it's easier to have it. Something like... But the minus here plus over here. And on here... The other buttons and on here... The top... The options. And then you have something like the P over here. And the sound. I think that's not what you're used to. I think I'll put a plus in the middle here. And then the P in the middle and the sound. Something like... Shit. Take your time. Plus, minus, plus... Almost. I think when you're holding it, you could press the minus and the plus and with the other fingers. Yeah, I think you're going to use it with one thumb. Perhaps I have some examples in the room. Will you adapt to the usability engineering? I've got some examples. Perhaps you should choose what's most often used. Because we can use that better. That I have those numbers. I don't really know. Channel selection per hour, 168. Volume selection four times an hour. But I mean if it's usually plus or above each other or next to each other. Not how often it's used. That depends on the remote. Here's next to each other. I think it's... I think I have two televisions in the home. Or a cell to what is vertical. It doesn't really matter. I think the volume is usually above each other because you go higher and down. The program is next to each other because you go further and back. That's how it's usually. Let's go to the chase. We don't have to decide about that now where we will put the button. It is user interface. It's complicated. It's in the actual design. You should know where you move places. Interface. We just heard about the new... It's easy for that. Or you would like to put it in a corner or something. You can talk into the corner. Not even necessary because you can make a very sensitive microphone. It's impossible to put it underneath it or on the bottom. Maybe at the bottom where you can hold it with your hand. That's not important. I think that's not very important. It doesn't matter where the microphone is. I think where it isn't seen the most. It shouldn't be very un-fiscible. It's put it in a logo of the company. It's just between the round of the art. It should be an important position where people can see it because it is the unique idea of our remote. Why do you want to put it? It doesn't make it any more fancy because you can find it better. It makes it more fancy because other remotes don't have it. We're talking about the button or the microphone. The microphone is a very small thing which you can make it look like it's big. It's really an important function of the remote. I think the left's other corner should be the best. It isn't the most inside. I think. Put it there. I don't mind. It doesn't really matter. It doesn't. It doesn't. Okay. So? Anymore? So, well, type supplements. Interface type? We already discussed this. The LCD. I think you said like scroll next to the remote. Isn't that handy? I think it's better to just type what you'd like to do on the screen if you want to go back. If you want to choose audio settings, you press audio settings and it goes to that submenu. That's my name, too. That's my name, too. Yeah. The young people do like the scroll. Yeah. I think so, too. So, why not? On side. Or at least, yeah, I don't know if you need a scroll. But the menu won't taste as though they're like most. And I think you can navigate through a menu. Yeah, I think you need to be the scroller. Yeah, I think you need a settings faster. I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options. But if you don't have a lot of options, then you have a lot of options. Because when you use the settings menu, for example, to look up some channels on your television, you should scroll down on a menu, which probably does not fit on your screen. Yeah, okay, true. So, then it's very handy to scroll down. Okay. You make just a rubber just like on your mouse or just put it on the side and it's very easy to use. Okay, no problem. And I think it would make it even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side which you can touch. It's also different. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. There's our five minutes warning. Any more questions about the design? Or do you use the interface? Different components? Color short, clear, shape, clear, materials, clear. Okay, what's the standard color? It works for a lot. Very standard. No, we have different color. How many colors? You have different colors, but you should have a standard color. I think black. Black. Black, I think, is the standard. With a yellow, darker, something like this color or something. Just a regular, a large color. Yeah. And then have different colors to use. I think it's better to have silver nowadays. Silver, yeah. I think it's more silver. Silver. Silver. Black. Silver. Black. Silver. Black. Silver. Black. Silver. Black. Silver. Black. Silver. Black. Black. Black. Black. Black. Black. But if you use silver, silver rubber isn't fancy. True. When you use titanium, silver is fancy, but when you use silver rubber, this is fancy. Silver has to shine, and rubber doesn't shine. Especially when you just made a soft rubber like this. Yeah. You understand? Yeah, I would think about colors like red, yellow, blue... Yeah, of course. The fruity colors. and other colors like red and brown, dark red and brown. Okay. Do I have to have a normal black one? Who should be? You think? Okay, so that wraps it up. Everybody knows what to do. Well, what to do? I wrote it down here. What to do? The next meeting is once again in 30 minutes. Here are the individual actions and especially notice that the individual interfaces are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board and of course to all four of us specific instructions will be emailed by a personal coach. Do we have to stay here or do we? Well, I'd say just wait for an email and find out. I don't know. Okay. Well, that was what I had to say. Final thoughts from anyone? No. Oh, thank you very much. Finished. Thank you very much. I'm talking English now. I'll make a new one for you. Thanks. And I'll face out. Bye. Okay, well, I'll try to put minutes in the project folder as soon as possible. Okay. Hopefully. Far side is done. Okay. Good luck. I'll start. Look. It's not a year. I've got that. Yeah. It's a smart board. Yeah. Um... Okay. Okay.
