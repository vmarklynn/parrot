Go ahead. Oh, there you go. Oh, there you go. Yeah, okay. Yeah, this one was finished. So, I'm going to show you. Oh, wow. Mmm. That's your new feature. That's your I think it's a very good feature. Yeah, that's your feature. Okay. Sorry. Good morning. Oh, good morning, everyone. Good morning. I'd like to welcome you to our first meeting. I've prepared a little presentation. My name is Marim Plonf, and I hope you will introduce yourself in a few minutes as well. I'm the project manager of this project, and well, I will tell you, Ferron, what actually is the project. This is the agenda for our first meeting. This is the opening. Then we will get, I will hope we will get acquainted with each other. We'll do a little tool training with these two things. We'll take a look at the project plan. There will be time for discussion. Actually, we have to discuss because we have to create a product, and then we will close this session. But first of all, I'd like to introduce you to this room. As you probably have noticed, there are little black fields on the table. You have to put your laptop exactly in that field, so the little cameras can see you. See your face. There are cameras everywhere around the room, especially here for your faceboard. This isn't a pie. It's a set of microphones, and there are microphones here also. Please, don't be afraid of them. They won't hurt you. As said, I'm the project manager, and I'm hoping for a good project. I'd like to hear who you are and what your functions are on this project. Let's start with the ladies. I'm Imkriel, and my function is user interface design. I think. That's me. I'm Esteine Maurer. I'm the industrial designer, and I hope to look forward to a very pleasing end of this project. My name is Danny Magr√≥w. I'm a marketing expert. I'm my job as a company to promote products to the customers. I also hope we have a pleasant work with each other. We have some expertise from different pieces of the company. As said, we're working on a project, and the aim for that project is to create a new remote control, which has to be original, trendy, and of course user-friendly. I hope we have the expertise to create such a project, such a product. The way we hope to achieve that is through the following methods. It consists of three phases, namely the functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design. As you can see, all of these phases consist of two parts, namely individual work parts, and a meeting where we will discuss our work so far. First, I will tell you something about the tools we have here. I already told about the cameras and microphones, but they are not much use to us. We will have to take advantage of these two things. They are smart boards. As you can see, you can give a presentation on them. This one here is a white board. I will instruct you about that soon. As you also noticed, this presentation document is in our project folder, and every document you put in this folder is possible to show that here in our meeting room. And yet, they are available on both smart boards, but I think we'll mainly use this one for the document in the shared folder. As you can see, this is the same toolbar as is located here. The most functions we will use will be to add a new page to go back and forward between pages, and of course, to save it every now and then. This is the pen with which you can draw on the board. For instance, like this, everything is okay, but I first put it on the pen. You see, I'm new to it too. And then you can write things like test or whatever you want. As you can see, you have to move it a little bit slow. It's not such a fast board. It's a smart board, but also a slow board, which you can write things. And of course, you can also, when you click here, erase things. So we have asked left. And you can also delete an entire page, but we ask you not to do that. Just simply create a new one and start all over because we want to save all the results. Does everyone understand this? So you can erase anything. Well, you can erase it with the eraser, but you shouldn't delete an entire page. You can just create a new blank one. I will delete this one now because we don't use it yet. But you can, of course, erase when you make a mistake, but don't delete entire pages. And you can also, let's see, I think it's here, change the color of your pen. For instance, take a blue one and change the line width. Five. And that's what you will need for our first exercise because I'm going to ask you to draw your favorite animal. It's also to guess to know each other because I'm asking three things for that drawing. To do it on a blank sheet with different colors, and I just showed you how to pick a color, and also with different pen widths, which I also showed you. And favorite characteristic can be just one word. Well, I'm not very good at drawing, but I will go first and try to draw. Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing. It's a sheep. It's a beaver. Well, it's weird. It could be everything. Maybe when I put on this thing, it could be a turtle snail. Or a snail. But the snail doesn't have legs. Okay. But a turtle has. And those are slow. And I hope our project group will not be slow, but we will work to a good result and do it as fast as we can. Okay. Time for another animal. Would you like to go next? It was forward. That is so good. Well, to make it a little bit easier. It's a giraffe. Or a dinosaur. I think it's easy to recognize. This is giraffe. The favorite characteristic is the long neck. It can reach everything. And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project. So that's my favorite animal. Anything else you need to write? I can't draw. I can't draw. It's a mouse. I can't draw. You can guess what it is. It's a rabbit. It's a quick. I guess. This is my favorite animal. I can't draw. I can't draw. I can't draw. I can't draw. I can't draw. I can't draw. I can't draw. Perfect. Thank you very much. I can see we have some drawing sounds. I have a drawing from the finance department. We are hoping to achieve that by aiming for an international market. The production costs will be $12.50 max. It's time for some discussion. What kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control? A lot of buttons. Complex. Not user friendly. It's not fun to use in black or black. We should try to make it fun. We use batteries. We use different devices. We use different devices. We use different devices. We use different devices.
