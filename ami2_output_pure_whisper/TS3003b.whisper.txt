 Good ethos. Now my laptop the h unintelligible. Does it again? It's working. OK, good afternoon. OK, everybody found this place again? Yeah, that's nice. OK, so this is our second meeting. And still failing. Yeah. Now we're going into the functional design. A important thing of this phase is that we're going to try to get an agreement about the user and the user and the user. OK, so we're going to go to the first meeting. OK, so we're going to go to the first meeting. OK, everybody found this place again? Yeah, that's nice. OK, so this is our second meeting. We're going to talk a little bit about the user requirements, technical function design and the working design so that we can move on to the second phase. But first is phase. First announcement, there's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system. So there's our ghost mouse again. That means that you can have a little trouble with air conditioning. That's because of this. OK, it's in wing C and E. So it should be over in a while, a couple of days. It's going to be cold anyway, so I don't think you're going to need it. Then our agenda, first the opening. This time I will take the minutes. You're going to have a presentation, all of you. And we've got 40 minutes for the whole presentations. So I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation, and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements, which have been sent to me. And then the decision on the control functions, which we want to include, which we don't want to include. So we've got 40 minutes for all of it. So I suggest let's start with the first presentation. Who wants to be first? I think I'll go first. OK. So maybe it's easy if you, yeah, I think you will tell them your presentation as well, which function you have, and where are you going to talk about? OK. My name is Frank Vamponin. I'm the market expert, but you already knew that. I've done some research. We have been doing research in a usability lab where we observe users operating remote systems. We let them fill out a questionnaire. We had 100 of these test subjects. In addition, we did some market research. See what the market consists of, what ages are involved. Well, these are three quite astonishing results, I thought. These are being considered ugly, 75% of the people question indicated that they thought in a remote was ugly, and an additional 80% indicated that it would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control. So in addition, remote were not very functional. 50% of the people indicated they only used about 10% of the buttons on a remote control. And 50% of the people indicated that the remote tended to get lost in their room. So, some things. Then we did some research to do the most relevant functions. Channel selection and volume selection both got a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 for relevancy. The power button got a 9, and teletext got a 6.5. So these are the most important functions of a remote control. Then there are some one time use function. That's what I like to call them. They're the audio settings, video settings, and channel settings buttons, which are not really used very frequently, but are still considered to be of some importance. Channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently, 168 times per hour. Then this is the market. 60% of the market consists of users between the ages 16 and 46. Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical under remote control. They like to use new functions, but they also are very critical. They won't spend their money very easily. So the users of 46 to 65 years, they make up 40% of the market. They're not really very interested in features, but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier. What I think this indicates for our design, I think we should make a remote for the future. This means we would have to focus on the ages 16 to 45. This also makes up most the biggest part of the market, so it would also be where our main profit would be getable. This would mean we would have to make a fancy design. The results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned thought that remote control caused errors, errors high. This is certainly something to take into account. And 34% thought that it was hard to learn how to operate the new remote control. So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design. Besides, of course, the remote must look very nice. Functionality, as a lot of people indicated, they only use about 10% of the buttons. I think we should make very few buttons. This will also be beneficial to the design of the remote. I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasized, especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons, because they are used most. So they should be robust. They shouldn't break down easily. Then, as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room, it might be, and I say it might be, because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot. But it might be a good idea to make a docking station. This would get a button in it, which would send a signal to the remote, which would then beep, so you know where it is in the room. And in addition to this, it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in. Then, surprisingly, a great deal of people indicated that an LCD screen in the remote control would be preferred. This was mostly people in the age of 16 to 25, but up to 45, it remains feasible. This would also greatly increase the production costs, but I think these are just some small factors we could consider. Okay. That would be all. Thank you. Anybody have any questions? No. About functional requirements. Okay, that's clear. To the second. Okay. I've been looking at that. Usually interface of it. Yeah. For the technical functions of it. Yeah, you can take your time. We've got plenty of time. That's been a slideshow. Yeah. There it is. Yeah. I think we must use the general functions of the remote control. I've learned a little research on the internet. Not much information about it. About interface. Yeah. I've been thinking about Simple manner to put a lot of functions in one remote control. You've got a lot of device like DVD, television, stereo. But it must be user friendly. You can put a lot of functions in one remote control. Yeah. Got many functions in one remote control. But you can see this is quite simple remote control. Few buttons. But this remote control got a lot of buttons. Yeah. People don't like it. So what I was thinking about was keep the general functions like the RS. Like the on-off button. Keep it like a red button. Everybody knows it. You don't have to change that. My personal preferences. Use a display for specific functions of the different device. What I was thinking about was you've got this the remote control. You've got the general functions like the on-off button. I don't know. Here you've got a kind of display. It's a touch screen. You've got the general functions of the device for a DVD player. For playing a reverse setter. You've got real buttons for selecting a device. This button is for a DVD or a DVD. For every device you've got a part display of a part buttons. You never got all the buttons on one device. That's my idea about it. Let's see. The buttons we have to use. We better use quite large buttons for everybody. If all people are young people, we must keep buttons quite simple and quite large. That was my part of it. Any other questions about technical functions? I think if we're going to use a touch screen, we're going to go way above the 12 and half euros. I don't think so. You've got quite a cheap touch screen. It's not in color or something. One color. I've seen something on the Internet. Not today, but a few weeks ago. It's quite a touch screen for 20 euros or less. It's possible. We certainly make a fancy design. It wouldn't be very robust. It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it. Maybe we can first listen to your presentation. We have a little discussion about the requirements. I think it's going to do. I've got a presentation about the working design. First about how it works. It's really simple, of course. Everybody knows how a remote works. The user presses a button. It determines what button it is, uses the infrared to send the signal to the TV switch to the frequency, or what function it is. We've got the plate. It's got conductive disks for every button. When the user presses a button, a signal goes to the LED and transmits it to the TV. It's a very simple device, technically speaking. This is a schematic overview. You've got the buttons, the power source. When a button gets pressed, it goes to the chip. The chip controls the infrared bulb and perhaps a normal bulb. When you press a button, you can actually see your pressed button. I think we should use default materials, simple plastics. Keep the inner working simple, so it's robust. I think we should focus on aesthetics, the design and the user interface, because if you're going to use high-tech materials, the price is going to go sky-high. You only have to design a remote once, and if you use high-tech materials, it comes back in every product. In my idea, it's going to be smart to invest in design and not in the product itself. That's it. Thank you. Okay. Now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we're doing right now. I'm the project manager, so I'm here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements. We've got to design a remote which is only suitable for TV. That's because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big if we want to have it for more functions. So it has to be simple. Another point is we have to skip the data text because in the world of upcoming internet, we think data text is going to be a thing of the past. It's a function we don't need in our remote control. The internet is also mentioned just to go in a function we can use maybe also on televisions that will be available as well. Another one is the customer is 40 plus. That's the market we have to target because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers. This is a bit pity for the marketing expert because he was aiming on the younger persons. We have to find a market which is above 40 plus but which will suit our remote control and the other way around. We have to be very attentive in putting the corporate image in our product so it has to be visible in our design in the way our device works. We have to be very clear on this point as well. I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions. Is there any discussion possible about the requirements? We can see if we can find a way between the functions we want to use and the market we want to reach with our product. You're saying that teletext is going to be an old feature and it's not going to be used anymore anyway pretty soon and new TVs will have internet access on them. I think if you're targeting people of 40 plus the chance that they will have a TV with internet access within the next 20 years is very slim. In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control. I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it. I'm pretty much against it. I think the market for 40 plus is pretty small. I think we're just going to go for another step. I think we can do a lot with the design. The simple buttons which are also mentioned. If we put a lot of effort in those we can make remote control with just two or three buttons or just three more which is suitable for the market we want to reach because it is 40% of the market. If you look in Holland the whole generation of 40 plus 50 plus is the biggest share of the whole population now. Yes but it's not the biggest part of the market. Besides that they're not very critical. They don't really care what the remote control is like. They'll just take the first thing they see which looks acceptable. But don't you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market that people think from the people think that's the device I've looked for although I didn't realize it. Let's try it. I think that would be the case in 16 to 45 age category because they are critical and they want to have a fancy remote control. People are 40 plus. I mean they want it to work but as soon as it works it's okay with them. I think that if we put our marketing right we can sell this just like I don't know if you've heard about it in the news the elderly mobile phone. It's a big success. If we make a remote control with that idea in mind we could make tons of money. We don't have to focus on the design then but on functionality. We just change our focus on the project. I think we can sell this. I simply think that the new products we're going to make specifically design are designed for younger people. Maybe we can focus ourselves on the elderly people. I think we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls. The channel selection is important. The volume selection power and data text. No we haven't voted yet. I think data text can be a function as well but only if it's not higher the cost. I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement data text as well but I don't think it will be a problem. I think it would be a bad idea not to include data text. Maybe we can make another point of advantage in our remote control. I think we can make a button for big subtitles which is instantly on the remote control for elderly people. I think it would be useful in our advantage. It's very important. We have a few buttons. I think we can make a button for the next channel, the previous channel, volume up, volume down and some teletext buttons. Maybe we can use the next channel button 35 times. Maybe we can implement the scroll button or joystick. There are other ways to look at telephones. The Sony telephone and the scroll button which is very useful in searching names. I don't think there are many TVs that can switch channels that fast. You would need a function where you can view all channels and scroll through it. Besides that if we are going to focus on elderly people they will have to adapt. Perhaps we should stick to the basic layout. If it's too much we can reconsider it. I think if you are going to make a remote control only to operate a TV, there is not much you can gain on having a few buttons as possible. There are many remote controls that can only operate a TV which only have the minimum number of buttons. I don't think there is much to be gained in that area. The number of buttons. I think it's very important in the design. You can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places. If you have less buttons you can do a lot more of it. That is true but I think there is simply not much to gain on the competition when you are making a remote control only to operate only the TV. If you have a remote control only to operate a TV there is simply not a lot of buttons required. There is not a lot of functions required. Most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either. I think it would be very hard to gain on the competition here. That would cost a big marketing expedition which was one of the arguments to make it only for the TV because we didn't have the time to market a lot. You should just we could better focus on for example the docking station like other functions. Instead of less buttons. I mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons. But I don't think we should spend very much time in that. Do you think the docking station is allowed in the budget we have? It should be possible. It is not too fancy and if the remote stays rather small it should be possible. I think that is a good advantage point as well if we have a fancy looking docking station. That is a nice requirement for the station. We are just going to focus on the extras. I think so. Maybe we should do some research into what other people like to have in a remote control. That is a good point. You said they easily get lost as well. Yes well 50% of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost. We should implement the audio site or something. Yeah that was what I suggested. We have keychain if you were to saw it go. We have some phones too. We just press the button and the phone goes ringing. Audio signal should be possible as well. I think it is not too expensive. Another point is the LCD screen. I don't know if that will rise the cost too much. I think we will have to choose between the docking station or the screen. Yeah it will be too much as well. I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control was hard to learn. We are focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices. It might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it which would explain a button if you press it. Which would tell you what it does. Yeah. And it wouldn't have to be touch screen or a very expensive screen. Just the LCD or just the normal screen. Just a small screen. Some extra info feedback. Yeah I think that is a good idea as well. But I don't know if that would... Is this small screen fitting to the... cost? Extra button info. I think it should be possible as well. Let's see what did we say more. It should be fancy design. Easy to learn. Few buttons. We talked about that. The docking station LCD. General functions. Yeah. Okay. And default materials. I think that is a good idea as well because... LDP people don't mind if it is a titanium cover or just a plastic one. So it doesn't really matter. Probably elderly people would be a little more careful with their remote controls and youngsters. And let's specify the target group. Are we talking about elderly people or people from 40 to 80? Because I think what we are going to design now is for people above 60. Maybe. What do we want? If we want to proflate us with... For example, the telephone for elderly people, we can target the real elderly people. I think that would be... If we should do something like that, it would be... I think it would be really good for the image of the company. Yeah. And I think there would be a good market for it. So that's the... Really bringing innovative product. And you're talking about 60 to 80, for example. Yeah, really. Yeah. I'd have to look into that a little more. Okay. And different cultures. Well, I don't think they have different television sets in every country. No. Of course. He's got five minutes left. He's got a small one. And with the little screen in it, which explains the buttons, I think it would be a lot easier to adapt to two different cultures. Yeah. In different languages. Yeah. Or you have to put a language button in it, but that will be a bit unnecessary. It's better to put it on different markets with... You know. Okay. So that's the target. Then a few small things. Okay. I will put the minutes in the project document folder. What we're going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept. Using interface designer to use interface concept and the trend watching. So just keep in mind the things we've said about the......about the target group requirements and the trends which are going on. And the specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach. Okay. So I thank you for this meeting. And I think we have a lunch break now. That's good. That's a good thing. Now we're not allowed to talk about it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
