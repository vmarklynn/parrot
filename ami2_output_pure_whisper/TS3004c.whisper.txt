 It won't wake up. Yeah, I was a bit early. Why? No, I just came in here normally. I was one of them. Okay. Come on. Check, check, check. Why won't it wake up? Is it done? It's probably that doesn't work. You turn it off. But huh? No, I don't. Okay. I received an email with a few possibilities on the materials. So I will discuss them. Okay, we just came to the back later. Yeah, I was... Shall we go and talk about the conceptual model? I'm sorry. It's one of those models. So that's me. Okay, so... Okay, so I'll just show you the... The minute. The minute. What's it called? I don't know. Minutes. Okay, so we just talked about... Do you want me to show it there? No, I just... Okay, we just talked about it. It looks... It has a look nice. Usability is very important. People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones. It has to be very basic, not too many buttons. Light switches on if you use a button. Textivity still has to be a possibility. And it has to be easy to learn. The other things I make minutes of. And the function is our full-room channel to choose channels on, off a mute button and the textivity button that are the functions. Is that right? Yeah. That's okay. So I just want to give you Mike again the first presentation of your... Shall I start? No? Okay, well, I received an email. Okay. I searched the web. And I searched on this document. We sent an investigation of the remote control market. It has been done in Italy and in another country in Europe. I forget it. But they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look and feel instead of the current functional look and feel. So it's very important for us to create something new. So what Michael just said, it must be some very different from ordinary remote controls. Fancy stands for an original look and feel of the case and interface. This aspect is the most important one. It came out of the research. It is twice important as the following. The second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological innovative. That stands for new technical features. And then this is a point of discussion because we just decided that we don't make use of LCD or speech recognition. But this is the second important aspect. And I think we must use some of the new technology to be innovative. So we already have the flashing light on that. Maybe some new. We have to discuss about it. We'll get back. Time of speech that do not exist in current remote controls. And that's very hard I think. The third one is the aspect that remote controls should be easy to use. But that was an overall point. We already discussed that. I've got one picture. Our target group we thought about was Yo and Trendy. So I took that part of the web page. And it says fashion watchers of a very friends in Italy. I have detected the following trends. This trends trend I think it's not that meaningful for us. Maybe but it's about clothes and shoes. But the next aspect also in contrast to last year the field of material is expected to be spongy. Spongy. What does spongy say? Spongy. So rubber kind of. Soft materials. Maybe that's definitely a good idea because you've dropped the remote control very often on the ground. So it has to be flexible. It's something that's standard. I didn't know what it means. So spongy means soft. It's also a stress ball. That's a good idea. It's the bit like the borders of the remote control. I have some material information but I will give you it later in my presentation. Okay, what do I think? Because a fancy look is the most important thing for remote control. I think about changeable fronts. Maybe I see through one in a fruit front because it's hot. And some basic color fronts. So we can make five different fronts to start with or something. Maybe an extraordinary shape like a spongy. Or just another shape than a normal remote control has just something round in it or maybe not. Yeah, I don't know. We have to discuss about that. Yeah, the main point still is the technological innovative. How do we do that? Maybe speech? We must have some kind of gadget. I'll get back on that. So it's very difficult to do it because it's only 12 and a half years you have to spend. Yeah, no problem. I got also an email from the technology department. Maybe watch first the next research about it and even more possibilities now with speech. So they recommend it using it. Okay. Let's check what the... First watch, both presentation first then. No, actually we don't have an idea how much is going to cost. Maybe it's cheap and easy to implement. They don't say how much it will cost. But if we implement... It's mass production, speech, classification. I think it would be better to implement LCD as well. Since you have to configure speech. That's definitely more expensive than... That's something I don't know. But we're going to make many of those so we can start a mass production and then... Yeah, but a telephone has... Okay, yeah. But a telephone also has LCD and... Yeah, so we've got it. And it's about 200 euros. We have to decide on that. Okay. That was this? No, no. I got an email and it says the chip can be simple, regular or advanced. And they say a display requires an advanced chip and this is more expensive than all the other chips. So it smells the most expensive. It smells the most expensive. It smells the most expensive. Yeah, it says an email. The display requires an advanced chip. Okay. And speech are good, nation? Yeah, probably too. I haven't got anything about speech recognition but... Oh, okay. Well, that's the most expensive chip we need if we're doing a display. Well, we can... All right. To make a sort of a design. So I did some searching on the internet. And what's the old remote controls and use remote controls? I think we should... this is one of the modern remote controls of the moment. I think we should go more to the iPod and the MPD players. Yeah, just mobile phones. More than more than but still a basic. Yes. You probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller because when you're in remote control you can see it here. You have to reach both sides and you just have one few buttons. So that's the main difference. But it looks, I definitely think we should go like this and then changeable funds. So that's the most important part I think. But on the home basis, something like that, something simple. Well, and then I just ordered the buttons a bit. Basic buttons on, off, mute and maybe two others. I don't know. Text button. Yeah, text button maybe there and there. And then the color buttons if we want it on. I don't find it very usable but I don't think it fits in the modern stream as well. And then where you saw the display in the iPod, you can put the basic buttons. One, two, three, four and above ten. That's on the display. No, no, there was no display there but it's on the place of the display. And I think we should light this up much more than that part. So focus is on these two parts. So you don't see all the buttons you have. But this one is very difficult to use because the volume and channel is on the bottom of it so you can use it down for it. This is how it is now. Here, well, volume, I think it is on the bottom too. It's not the best. Well, here I have also side scrolls. I don't know if you can use that. Yeah, I've got something on that. For volume or channel? For volume. Well, then we can even simplify it more by just putting the volume on the side and just channel buttons here. Yeah, I think the channel buttons are often used and you can use them now with your thumb because the thing is not easy to use. Well, control. Basically, that's here. Yeah, okay. Maybe we should put that on top and buttons we don't use on any buttons. Yeah, just the older buttons like textivity. You put that on the button. Because you can't hold it. You can't hold it alone. Yeah, control and push the buttons. Except from the on off button. Oh, okay. Well, yeah. Well, I think you'll use the switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons like one, two, three. So maybe we can put that on the bottom. Maybe I don't know. Like zapping is just switching. Maybe it's not easy if it's below. It's harder to zap. So I think it should be, it should be easy. I think it's pretty standard. These row buttons on the top. Yeah, okay. That's good. But if you don't light them up, they don't, you don't seem very good. I think it's moderate to light this area up and to light this area up. So the focus gets on this part and not on there. Yeah, okay. But the position of course can be different. We have to look at what's easy to use and how it's easier to use. So we can switch these to, I don't know if it will look good if you put those on the bottom. No, I think the top buttons are okay. Those should be on top. Maybe we can switch those to. Do us to, yeah. And yeah, you have to make sure it's easy to, yes, that has to be big enough so you can heal. Right. Okay. Well, that's my finding. So my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look and be player. And well, if you want to put in a speak recognition or something, I don't think we should put it on top then. I think that if you're going to put in more technology, that you need to be able to switch it open. Do you use? Yeah, that's cool. So if you put in a speech recognition, you need so many more buttons which won't look good on the front side, I think. Okay. No. So that's something we have to decide on. Yeah, we have to keep it simple. Yeah. We have to decide this lecture. What are we going to do? 50 minutes. Yeah. I was just going to look. Okay. The component design. I looked at some similar devices and my own common knowledge. So this was on the website. If you aim at a young public, you should use materials that are soft with primary colors like green, blue, red. So flashy kind of colors. Shapes should be curved. So round shapes, not nothing square like. Okay. So, okay. Your iPod is trendy. And it is. No curved square. It's right. Yeah, but it has round corners I think. Okay. So we shouldn't have two square corners. Yeah, okay. Not the old box look. And sports and gaming divine style characteristics. I don't know exactly what that means, but it should be, well, yeah. Popular kind of. Yeah, we have to put our real reaction logo as well on the, on the removed controls. So the colors also, so we have made make it in black, black, yellow. Yeah, black yellow. Maybe the sides yellow and the top black. Not that weird because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy to attract a young public. But I don't think the colors black and yellow go well together. Maybe you can put the yellow on the side and black on the front. That's just a matter of taste. But yeah, okay. We have to use kind of flashy colors. Can't we use different fronts with all with the logo on it? Yeah. Can we do that? Like France in red and yellow and blue and still transparent. Okay, but with all with logo on it. Okay. Well, this is a remote control, a very old one. Then the components, the case is just the, here's black. Maybe we have to make it from software material. Sure. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe. But anyways, it should be transparent, we decided that. No one of the options. You can, just like a mobile phone, you can make a perfect font on it. So you can just replace them, I think. Yeah, we could do that. But I do just release one. Give five with them just in the box. Yeah, or just a different one. You could make them like blue and transparent. So you can still look through it. The buttons, normal rubber, I think. Like normal ordinary buttons. Yeah, I don't know. It could be like a Nokia, like the new. Yeah, just a hard part. It's better. It's a rubber really as an old look. Okay. And then the new modern remote controls. The buttons are part of the style, I think. It's part of the remote control itself. It's one out of one shape. It doesn't, it's a button. Yeah, it's all on one level. It doesn't come out of the background. It is in the remote control. Yeah, I know what you mean. So we have to keep it on one level. Yeah, like mobile phones. The top is, yeah. Not the iPod. Yeah, okay. So that should be hard plastic than the buttons, I think. Or maybe it's the kind of material that is. Yeah. Maybe you can make it around platform soft material. Just only the basic remote control from normal plastic and the rounds of it from soft. Okay. Then the LED, the normal infrared LED, I think. It's sufficient. And backlight LEDs. So yeah. But I think we have to make the case transparent. Otherwise the backlight won't work. So if you put, you can just not put my run to buttons. Yeah, that's right. Okay. Or run to the whole. Yeah, but we can still make it transparent. You can have transparent or just that it comes out a bit. Okay. Good. And in green color, the backlight or? Difference, I think also. Blue. Blue, red, whatever you want. I think it depends on the color. Maybe you can choose it when you buy it. That's true. Now I think there are multiple color LEDs. So is it okay? Yeah, but can you change the color? I know. I know. I can't control you. Maybe it's more important. We can put some different ones. I think it doesn't matter. I have to remind, I have a blinking light on my phone and I can change the color of it. Okay, cool. Just make it some different color, blue, red and green. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's too expensive. Well, I don't think so. Put in any fancy technology yet. Then some more technical things. I don't know what it is, but it should be there, I think. This is the normal circuit board, like chip board in a lot of things. You have to hurry up a bit. So we just need this and this transistors and resonators, this is all these kind of things. They basically said that's almost the same on any remote control. So I guess we just need that. I don't know what they do or... Yeah, you can change. No, but they just said we needed the battery contacts, like normal batteries. You can put it. And recharge maybe. Yeah, we just make sure. We still want to have a recharge. Yes, yes. Yeah, but we don't want to have a... How do you call it? Aku. Recharge. Recharge. Just batteries. Rechargeable batteries. Yeah, batteries, yes. Rechargeable batteries. Not a separate. No, just rechargeable batteries. And a chip, that's this one. Then I received some possibilities. For the energy source, we can use batteries or a kinetic, like with the pulse watch. So it operates on your wrist. Okay. So if you have a normally remote control on the table or... Yeah, I don't think it will work. And we can also use solar cells, but you must use it indoors. Just batteries, that's cheaper. Yeah, and we can use the home station kind of thing. Cases, flat, so uncurfed. 2D curved is like front to the back. And 3D curved is also in depth. Okay. So that's possible. But with 3D curved remote controls, we must use rubber buttons. So we can use the flat. So we need 2D. Yeah, I think. Definitely. These kind of materials can be used. But it doesn't really matter. We just make it plastic. Yeah. Yeah, I think so too. Scroll wheels, that's cool. This is for the full view. Yeah, scroll wheels. Yeah. Yeah, that's good. We can use multiple scroll wheels too if we want to. But I think just the volume is enough. For channels, it's not handy. Okay. You scroll it fast. And the LCD. So we need the most expensive chip if we use an LCD. I don't think that's an opportunity. Just skip it. Because we don't have time for that to. Okay, done. We must use the second most expensive chip. So the regular chip. Because we use scroll wheels. Yeah. And yeah, that was it. Okay. I guess. Are we using a rubber case or? Oh, I just decided. Maybe we have to skip that one as well. I don't think it will be a case. It should be soft. Something about the trend too. The trend is spongy. And fruit or fresh. Fresh. Okay. Now we have nothing about those two. Yeah, fruit and fresh can be just the covers. Yeah. So you can just off-line the spongy. Yeah, I don't know. I can't imagine. No. I don't like it. No. I just got to imagine it. So just hard plastic? Yeah. Okay. Titanium. It's mentioned there. Titanium, I think it's too expensive. Yeah, maybe the form has to be a bit different. Not the square form just a bit. Yeah, you can make it curved or round. And just in 2D, nothing adapts. Yeah, that's right. So if we have to decide which one we're going to choose from these, what exactly? Because we have to know it. So the energy is to recharge and you already know that? Yeah, that's right. The chip on prints is a normal one. Yeah. Okay, the case is just a plastic one. Yeah, the chip is the regular one. You have to simple one, regular and it's fine. So it should be regular in the second. Okay. I think I'll just check it. And we need a plastic case with a scroll wheel. No matter the least. Yes. That's pretty much it. Yeah. And it actually lies. So I'm not sure. I don't know if we're expected to roll on this one at this moment. I don't know. Or should we do it in the next meeting? ID and UID work together on prototype drawing on smartboard. So we should do it here. So we're staying here? Or should we do it in the next meeting? I think that's the next meeting. Okay. But you definitely get a specific instruction. Okay, so I don't work through the minutes alone again. But think about something that's more rounded and more... Yeah, I didn't know. But the iPod and etc. And the player has mobile phones. I bet just on the top one. Yes, the bits currently. Okay. I'll see if I can see any of these. Maybe the wheel can be like this. If you draw it like this. Get it. What the fuck is it? Okay. Doesn't work. You see what I mean? If I draw here... What? It draws about four centimeters over the middle. Okay. Maybe you can make it like this. This is all the wheel for a volume. So you can do... Like a very big scroll wheel. Yeah, but just not on the top, but on the side of it. Okay. Okay. So we have this at the moment. I think you'll get a lot of volume changing when it's not one. Okay. So we have this? Is that okay? Yeah. That's good as well. Yeah, but maybe we can make a plastic so that if you drop it, it won't change the volume. Yeah, I don't know if you use your thing like this. That's quite about crazy. Like this. And what's the channel choose? Where do we put that? I think in middle. It's in the bottom or? Yeah. What is the middle part? That's the numbers. I think the numbers should be in the bottom and the switch channel in the middle. Yeah, I agree as well. It doesn't make a difference if you put the switch channels on side of each other on top of each other because you already have to volume here. So you can also put it here one bit and the other one there next to each other. Yeah, that's right. Back in front of you. So you can also put it all on the top and this. You keep this empty because you have to hold it as well. Or you could do the switch channel up button above the numbers and switch channel down button. That's not the one too. That's very quick. I think zipping style is priority and then you use those. Is this opportunity? Yeah, of course. Yeah. But I think we should put them on top of each other. So why? Because then it's easy to know if I push the. But still the next one. Yeah, but the top button is like you switch channel up and down button is. Yeah, but if you put them after writes exactly the same, it doesn't make a difference. I think it's. But I think left to right is more often associated with volume and top down is more with channel changing. It's like almost remote controls. So if we use that, they will probably have a long learning time. I don't know. You already have volume on the side. So you can't make it. You can't make it. You can't make it. You can't make it. I think it's simple. It's just. Okay. So what else do we have to discuss about? I think we need to work three minutes again. We have to get it. It looks really new because we still hold on to the ordinary square. Yeah. We're not control because what I see, the only difference in fact is that we use a scroll wheel on the outside. And the left. Yeah, but it should be around in shape. The current controllers are all black and plastic. You have to look at that image of the iPod. Yes. More that kind of style. And that you don't the old gray black. Some kind of blingling. Well, you can put a very, if we do it like that, we have below if we do a lot of room to put a nice logo. Yeah. The logo has to be on there. And how many fonts do we put on the market then? Five or something? More or is it a customer? Maybe you can buy separate ones. And by the product you buy, you get one. And you can choose one. If you buy the project, that's your choice I think. So you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharge. Is that a good opportunity? Yeah. So I put it like that. Okay. Yeah. You let it slide in the docking station. Do we have to design that as well? The docking station? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, we can. Yeah, that can be for example. Just a recharge. Just a second. Yeah, around something. Like, yeah, we had one example. But we have to make contacts on the remote control and the recharging as well. Yeah. But that's a round one. Maybe we can choose them. Here you just see one. That's very round. Oh, yeah. Okay. So I think that can be all kind of shapes. But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit. After remote control. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you don't want to, like the eye pops and fills, but more rounded. Yeah. Yeah. I think it will just look like more like this one since this is also rounded. No, just the corners. Right here. Okay. Those are already a bit cornered. Okay. Yeah, but we can do all kinds of, as long as it is in 2D, we can use all kind of round shapes. Yeah, okay. But then we have to think of something totally new. Yeah. Yeah, if we want to make it kind of new. I've had a lot of pictures of old ones and all curves have already been done. It's a bit annoying, is it? Yeah. What do we do wrong? Just more like this and not square. Yeah, okay. Yeah. I could do a lot of, a lot more curving. I would do it. Yeah. I know we can do a lot more, but yeah. Like in this kind of shape. Oh, sorry. I know you. Okay. I don't know. I don't know if it's handy. I think it will only look more like the old remote controls. This? Yeah. The old ones look like just a square thing. Yeah, okay. But I had a lot of pictures. Oh, I can show you here. What the old ones look like. Mm. Curves, curves. Yeah. Even more than there as well. Yeah, okay. This wasn't a very small one. Yeah. If you go very simple. So we have to make a decision what kind of form it's going to have. Yeah. I don't know. I think if, in my opinion, if we just take the iPod and the same look. So light or just whatever color but the same light color. And just together with the back lights, we'll look very new. No rubber buttons or something. Just together with the black lights, you'll get a totally new look. More like the MP3 player. Yeah. And you have to scroll button and side. Yes. Why do we have to round it on the bottom then? Skip that one as well. Doesn't have to be? Okay. Yeah, it's cool. Yeah, that's a trend if we want to make it. But yeah, I'm not a trend watcher. You are. So the trend is? The point G. Spongy and fruity. But yeah. Spongebob. It's not a lot of friends I find. Okay, so we have still one minute left. I think it's okay if you just give it a bit square. Okay. I don't know something about ergonomic kind of fits in hand. But I think it's still for older people. You still have older people. It's only annoying if it's like that form like that. Like whatever. There is one. Yeah, but we're aiming at the young. Which is one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original. And I hope we can make it look not like the iPod itself. It must have an idea. But if you look at the way remote controls are now. Yeah, I don't know. But it is already fancy because it's a light on the bottom of it. Yeah, okay. So that's already a very big change. Maybe make the, what's it called? Scroll wheel, make it in yellow or something. Just like the corners of real reaction. Yeah, yeah. Well, now we could do that. Could. Yeah, but if you change the front, the scroll wheel will still be yellow. Yeah, I think that's right. The scroll wheel won't be very big since if you put it somewhere and chances that it will scroll are too big. So it will just be a small, small scroll wheel. So it won't stick out much. Yeah, maybe the ones who are going to draw there, maybe have to ask to her if it can work better than this because it doesn't work properly. No, maybe it's all sure. Maybe you can just open images there and I'll paint and paint. Okay. Yeah, it'll do a very good job. If you set it down, he will draw here. It doesn't work. Okay, so just finish it. So we make it a bit like that one probably. Yeah, is that okay? Yeah, I'll see. Yeah, I agree more. Okay, only the color and the flashy light. Yes. We just skipped the photo or the speech recognition. Yeah, do we skip that? Yeah, I think. Or keep that? Okay, but you definitely need a. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I think so. We have to build in a microphone and. Well, that's very easy. We already have the beeping of the. Yeah, I don't know anything about that. I didn't receive any information on speech recognition. Yeah, that's hard. The information about that. The main points I just said, do you have to be original in technological, innovative? Go, yeah. Just put a speech recognition in it as well, okay? So we clap it open then? Yeah. So we can put all the. I think she'll have that in there. And we need a. Probably we need a. At phones chip then. Yeah, we probably do. But it doesn't say anything about it, does it? No. We don't have any information about the cost. No. We started with information about. I just received. I have some information about the cost, but just about the chip. And how much is the chip? I don't know how much. You are the business. Just something new. Expense information. The integrated program, simple, simple, speaker unit. This is a very small electronic unit. We'll give a standard answer after it recognizes the question. How does it work? It doesn't say. You say record followed by your question sample and after a few seconds the answer is simple. The question. So it works like good morning remote control and then remote control says good morning. Does that say anything? No. Does it say something bad? Okay, we have to stop it now. Well, that's integrated into chips. So if you use speech recognition. That's a separate chip. I don't know. But if you use speech recognition that will be in it as well. Okay. Yeah, I don't know anything about this. We just decide not to put it in because it's too difficult. I don't know. It would be a good feature. Yeah. Okay, we just put it in. No worries about the cost, etc. Okay, just stop it. Okay, fine. 30 minutes? Yeah. Okay. Ciao. Okay. Ciao. Hello? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I should make it on. Okay. Yeah, good thanks. Okay. Okay. Okay. Coffee. Yeah, okay. Okay.
