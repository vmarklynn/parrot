 it's not even cheap greenhouse Editor for that reason. No. Ah yeaahahah.! I didn't see it yet I think. Did I miss something? Yeah, pretty much. I thought I'd come and mail you so I thought I'd just drop it in. Hey, what's wrong with my computer? It's an iconita who is telling you. Yeah, that's my presentation. Oh, right. Hey, everybody ready? Sorry, I'm not a good player. Okay, where do I find this? I'm not a good player. And then, I'm a paradise. You read the new flash? No, what was it? Oh, no, press it. Yeah, no, but my screen is reduced in size. What? Feedback? Okay. I'll delete. Let's see. So it doesn't draw the attention away. I made my own map. No, not this, but the task. No, I just flipped it, close it, took it here and then this happened. And that's not the way it's. Where was it? It's settings. Okay, all right. Thank you. Do you guys like your task? I get my function, you know, the information that I need. So frustrating. Yeah, I don't like the end and just typing it to that. Oh, I have to do that. So, this presentation is mainly based on my own ideas because I hadn't time to integrate the information yet. Really annoying. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Okay. So, I'm going to talk about functional requirements. Well, some research has been done, has been done, observing of 100 subjects and usability lab using the remote control. They also fill in a questionnaire. The findings were, well, you can see them for yourself. They dislike to look at field current remote controls. They're ugly. They do not match the operating behavior of the user, so they don't match what they want to have on it. They're often lost somewhere in the room. It takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control. And they're bad for error's eye. I don't know how a user can read that, but okay. There was also research on the most relevant and irrelevant functions. Most irrelevant and less used were audio settings, mono stereo, pitch, bass, screen settings for brightness and color and stuff like that. But they are used. They do need to be under remote control. And if you can't control the sound settings, I mean, if you dislike a very loud bass or something, you need to change that. Yeah, we have to. If he doesn't have an equalizer. Yeah, I mean, we can't, my TV has, but we can leave them away. Most relevant and most used functions, they speak for themselves, I guess. Power button, channel volume selection, daily text, but we can skip that because I saw the new slash and daily text is so outdated that it should not be used anymore in the future. So forget this one and channel settings. So for programming your channels in the right order. Where did you guys get that new slash? Yeah, I didn't get anything. On the project. Not by mail. I received mail, but you don't. No, so it's a text file in the project folder. So daily text can be skipped. That's in the presentation. There was some research on new features in the remote control about an LCD screen and speech recognition. Well, we got an update for the audience or the targeted group. So it's above 40, I guess. The new product or below. Because that's pretty relevant. I thought our ads. Our current customers are in the age group 40 plus. Yeah. And the new product should reach new markets. Below. Okay, well. That's in the new. Okay, that's good to know. Because you see a clear distinction between the age groups concerning the features. And above 40 people are not so interested in the screen or speech recognition. But below that age they pretty much are. So I think we can build that in. Yeah, well, we can skip this part as well because I thought our ad above 40. So we could skip the features, but we just have to build them in because they find it very interesting. Well, we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user friendly as possible. And also, so not only the design of the buttons but how you can push them and stuff like that. So the physical aspect of it. And I think certainly for the lower age groups, a nice design. Which does not make the remote control or no to stay in your room. It's actually a part of your interior of your design in your room. So the people can say, whoa, what's that? Well, that's my remote control. So it has to look nice and feel nice and have all the functions. But it also needs to have corporate identity. Yeah. So the logo has to be present and the colors as well. We can change much of that. Two years. Yeah. But I don't think that's a problem because the thing has to have a color anyway. And most of the time there is a brand present on it. So I think that's not going to affect it very much. But that are the consequences of the marketing part. It's open already so you can use all top. Oh, you're here. Oh, no. You pressed all the four? No, no, no. I pressed the mouse button. Oh, great. That's a self-destruct button. Yeah. Maybe you can do it from your computer. Yeah. Yeah. And if you go stand around here. Yeah. Sure. All right. That's nice. Yeah. All right. I had two examples. This one is the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons. This is the easy one. I think we have to combine them. And yeah, merge the best functions of all examples. But yeah, the H is under 40. Yeah. And marketing research stated that that kind of users are not afraid of a lot of functions. So not too much. Yeah. Yeah. We do have to integrate the screen and the speech recognition. Yeah. All right. Yeah. This one we can remove for kids. It's just only for adults. So we can use some advanced options. Yeah. From age of 16. Yeah. But I prefer we use the basic options. Yeah. We have to make them very easy. So for just zipping around channels, you can just push one button. But if you want to use your video recorder or something else, you should use an advanced option. Yeah. But the news flash also stated that it should control only one device. So only your television. Yeah. Okay. So it's very easy. Now, yeah. So there are not extra options in this case. Okay. Also, yeah. We have to make it fashionable. Yeah. You want to set it before. Yeah. The basic functions. Yeah. Only use the extra functions if they are really needed. Yeah. So maybe you can hide them or something. Yeah. Well, what we can do with the screen is all the configuration options. You can put that in the screen. Yeah. Screen menu to do that. And then the basic function just under defies itself. So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen with a clear menu. Yeah. Uh, functionality is the screen. What does the screen do? All right. All right. It's low on power. What are they? So what does the screen do? They said they needed it. What does it do? What do they want? For the advanced functions, I think. Yeah. Well, it didn't say what they want to do with the screen. My guess is pretty handy for advanced functions. Right. Searching for channels. Yeah. Searching for channels. Programming them. Nevermind. I'm almost finished. Okay. We have to watch out for the, if we make it very fashionable, the functionality will go down. So we have to make a compromise between functionality and fashion. Complement them for them. Yeah. Yeah. That was the end. Yeah. Okay. Well, my presentation is a bit sucky. Well, you can improvise, right? Yeah, a little bit. No. No. No. Do you think there are requirements? Yeah, I think that will be it. No. So we can go for it. That was, you know, you know. Let me check. It's not really English. I know. The kickoff. Our working design. We got it. So we can go for the look and feel of the left example and then a screen on top of it. Here you go. All right. How do I skip pages? Just press the keys. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Well, I was working on this before I got my information. So I was just working off the top of my head using my common knowledge about remote controls and, well, the info on the website, which came to it. So I didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet. This is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last meeting. Those were my starting points. I was working on a, yeah, on a schedule and I was supposed to do it like this, but, yeah. Then the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow. So I was trying to organize them for myself and then make the design, the design, the actual design, but I never came around to do that. So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about it. I mean, everything speaks for itself, I guess. I mean, you press a button, it sends a signal to a chip, which translates it into infrared signal of certain spatial frequency. Yeah, frequency. And our temporal frequencies, actually, and then through a transformer, the signal gets boosted and then sent to the receiver on the TV to feel translated into the function. Yeah, well, this was actually all I got around to do. I mean, I don't know if I'm too slow for this stuff, but then work harder. Should we make a list of all the functions we want to... Yeah, we want to incorporate into it. Okay, for those that didn't see yet, the basic new requirements of the management were no-time text, only for TV. It should be designed for a user group below 40, but I don't think it's wrong if we can target the current customer group as well. And the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control. And we have to decide on the functions and on the... Let's see, what was it? The target group. We have to make me clear what that is. The target group of users? Yeah, it uses. Because it says below 40, I mean... Yeah, I think it's easy, but... Yeah, or male and female. Or in just... No, it's below 40. The marketing research started on the age of 16, 16 to 25, 25 to 35, 35 to 45, something like that. So below 40 is okay, but we need an lower level in which to... How do you miss? So is it from 16 to 40? Is it from 20 to 40? Yeah, it's from 16 to 40. I guess people of 16 are quite used to technology. So they adapted pretty soon, I guess. If we have a larger public, we have more options to sell our product. Yeah, so what we might want to do is... Yeah, have customized the screen functions, if you know what I mean. Younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines, they can use more advanced functions, but maybe elderly people don't understand it so well. So they need a simpler remote. And that you can choose what the design displays or whatever. That's right, I wanted to make two different groups of functions. The simple functions for the whole public and the advanced options for the younger people who are more experienced. But they all incorporate it in the screen or just on the remote itself. I should put the advanced options onto the screen display. Yeah, like you have a visual of the brightness with a sliding bar and a bus and stuff like that for sound and visuals. You should have a menu for all the issues. Make a drawing. Select. That's okay. That's very big. Yeah, we get there. Yeah, well, this is basically a remote. Usually the power button is on top, I guess. It should fit right into your hand. Right. Most people are right-handed, so maybe less than a special decision, but okay. If you put it like here or something, I don't know. Then you can put a screen on a mobile phone, also on top, I guess. Yeah, but if you are using the normal functions, the basic functions, you normally do this. So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your thumb, also reach the middle, or you should screen at the bottom. Then you can see it very clearly. Okay, so you have your hand and the screen is below and the buttons are in the middle. For example, if you put the screen here, it's more about the functions now than the layouts. It doesn't work too well. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Okay, you get it. For example, if you put all the... Right. You want the normal piece of paper and there's a 10? Yeah. Yeah, my piece is... Kind of works. Like if you have 10 buttons for all the channels, an ear button for flipping. Yeah. And the following? Yeah. That's usually like here, here, here, here. Yeah. So we have up and down for the channels. Left and right. Left and right for the volume. Those can also be used for the menu. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. But this is really your department that we need just functional displays. Yeah. And for a cursor, this is function. And you... Yeah. If you can use the... Most of the time you have one button in the middle. It says menu. Yeah. And then if you press it, the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down. And left and right to go into a function. Yeah. And then just... Most of the time this menu button is also like, okay, to confirm a kind of action. So you scroll into it, okay, you select a function like base. You just adjust it with these two buttons. Yeah. Then okay to confirm. And then on each screen, this should be an option to go back to an upper level. And then finally say, okay, exit or one button to exit it. Yeah. In one time, I don't know that's not really my department. That's more your department too. It's a logo on the remote control. Yeah. But it should be if the screen is here, then the logo should be on top. Yeah. I mean, it's... Yeah, but that depends on where you put the screen. Yeah. It's essential that there is a screen. Yeah. I mean, the position of the screen is also more essential than... I mean, we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there. And for the speech recognition part, if we want to incorporate that, we need the microphone. Yeah. So it should be... I mean, if you have it in your hand here, it should be on top somewhere. Yeah. Why do we want to put the display in the bottom? No, that's not sure. That's not sure, but... Maybe. Maybe. Because if you use the functions, your hand will block the display. Yeah, okay. But that's only for the basic function. If you are going to use the iPhone option, you are going to press the menu button and then... Yeah. I mean, the screen on top looks more... Normal. Logical to me also because people use mobile phones and they also have a screen on top. Okay. Yeah. So you just have to reach a little bit for the power button. Yeah. I mean, if you grab it... Once it's on, it's on. But most of the times, if a TV is on standby, people just press the check. Yeah, we put it on top. So we put this on top and then make the corporate logo like over here, R-R. And the microphone, I mean, it can be very small if you look at your mobile phone. So these are some stripes, little holes. Maybe on the top or even on the side. Yeah. Maybe on the side, I mean, if the microphone is good... Yeah. Okay. So on the top is better. But if you hold the remote like this, if you put it on the top on the side, I don't know. Yeah. It should be able to... Yeah. It doesn't... It doesn't... Okay, well, leave this up to you. Yeah, it doesn't matter that much. So... But the screen is on top. Which functions did we have left? I mean, this is basically numbers for you. For you. For you. Channel up and down. Channel up and down. Up there. Outphones options. Yeah. Maybe we should decide what outphones options we want to put in the LCD screen. Yeah. That's a good one. Yeah. So we needed to integrate those sound and image options, right? Yeah. Like... Sound. Sound. So we need kind of an equalizer. Yeah. Equalizer. So if you have sound. But not too advanced. Most TVs use only treble and bass. Yeah. Treble and middle bass or something. Yeah. It's pretty hard to write. And... Yeah. Okay. But you have sound? Yeah. Sound. Yeah. You have a digital... Better write it down over there. So we have sound. Just a... Secret. Yeah. Yeah. Sound. And then... Within sound, I guess, treble and bass. Yeah. Yeah. The mono stereo option. Yeah. And also... There was something else also. And then... Pitch. Pitch. Yeah. But pitch isn't that... Yeah, that's the height. Yeah. The frequency is down. Yeah. Okay. Why would you use that? Yeah. Isn't this... It depends on the signal of the program you're watching. Yeah. And also the tuning part? Programming part. Yeah. Channel programming. So we have sound, yeah. Channel programming. And... Yeah. In the functionality of the... Telefician. No, no. Of the remote. Do we want the buttons to make sound when you press them? As a confirmation? Or whatever, you know? I don't know. I think it gets annoying. I mean, most mobile phones use that in the beginning. But... You can disable... Under the advanced option. You can put those in. The... The telefician itself has also the options with brightness and screen color, etc. So... Contrast. Yeah. But people don't want to sit underneath... Underneath in front of the telefician which is usually only three buttons and it's very hard to. Contrast. Yeah. Contrast and brightness. Point. Yeah. That's the most used, I guess, if you don't get your money turned. Yeah, well, I guess this were the only ones, I guess. Okay. It's easy. Yeah. But so we have... We have TV options which is all this. The sound... The options. The sound image. And you have in the... The... Indeed. The remote control options. Yeah. So we need two menus kind of thing. Yeah. You have basically a button menu which you can use directly. Uh-huh. According to the opris port and the LCD options. Are activated based on some software options that's communicated with the infrared. Yeah. With the chip and then trans... I mean... So you have an additional processor in. Yeah. Well... Yeah. We have power button, whether that's present. Channel volume selection present. Numbers present. Yeah. Audio settings, monosterior pitch, bass, treble, screen settings, brightness and color. Yeah. Yeah. Contrast this. Yeah. Okay. Color and brightness. Yeah. Um... And which is a channel setting. So channel programming. So you have an option to start scanning all the frequencies. Yeah. And when it encounters one. Well, it shows on your TV. And then you can... Um... Uh... And then you can select a number in your remote. So the channel program is auto-seek. Yeah. Auto-seek. Uh... Name a channel. Or... Well, most TVs automatically display the name which they get through the cable. Oh, they get the ultimate name. Yeah. So you only have to choose the position on your... It only has to match the channel frequency on your TV. Yeah. With the position on your TV. And so your remote. Yeah. But can you also say I want Veronica on the channel number 5? If you already programmed it. Yeah. If you want to move it. Yeah. That should be possible too. How do you call that? Yeah. How do you call that? Mmm. Well, you should be able to browse through a list or something which displays all the values, all the channels which are possible. I mean like 1 to 30 or 4.9 here or whatever. Just browse through it and then... Um... Some kind of way. See if it is programmed. Swap channels? Yeah. Swap channels. Swap is good option. Okay. So most of the time, if you swap it. Let's say for example you have RTL5 on channel 5. And Veronica on channel 8 and you want to move Veronica to channel 5. Most of the time you overwrite the previous one. Well, that's sort of... Yeah. It's pretty... Yeah. I mean you have to look on the menu. Those are working. On the TV. Also. He only has to figure out how it has to look. Yeah, but also which buttons you have to press to get a certain result. Yeah, okay. The working design was to specify how the physical interaction between the components was. I... Yeah. It treated your homework. But um... Yeah. Or is it too hard to just do it on your remote to program the channels? No. It should be able to do a thing with the television is difficult. But that's not our part. No. We don't have to design protocol. That's true. That's true. Thank God. Yeah. Okay. So we have to figure out a way to do that easily. I mean the auto-secret is not a problem. You are a counter-channel and then it just says on which number do you want to save this? And you just press the number on your remote and then say confirm. And it's safe. It's easier. It's harder to, if you have already programmed it, to swap. So we have to think of something for that. The user interface design can design a menu for all the use functions. Kind of structure into layers. I mean you make a map with all the... Yeah, because it's now... There are also documents. Yeah. Yeah, I can. I'll just try to reorganize things. So you design the basic function menu for the LCD screen. And the layout of the thing itself. I think the layout of the screen. I think you can concentrate more on the bit and placement and the placement of the screen itself on the... Isn't that more than the... This is the interface. No, I think there's more in... All the functional aspects of the... Maybe more than... I think I am in my department. I have to know what it has to do. So if you want to... You know, the changing the channels kind of thing is... I have to integrate that in the design. So you lay out your function. Yeah. One function, okay. I think that's a good example. I have to make the menu layout also. Yeah. Yeah. I guess so. I think that's your department. Yeah. We have to kind of work together. If I make the... The menu, like... I have to state which function has to be in the menu and then you have to decide it in the way that is your friend. You are going to make a list of what functions are going to be on the menu screen. And I'm going to make a nice menu. Yeah. With some layers in it. Yeah. And also... Make clear which buttons to press to get certain results. Yeah. Because that's always difficult to every device that's on... Yeah. I guess this button, the okay menu, okay. Or you can incorporate two different buttons like you have on your mobile phone. So this is only to get in the menu or to exit it. And then I want to confirm. I want to go one step back. So it's like the the say button on your mobile phone if you have a Nokia or like that or the no button. To go one step back, it's only two extra buttons. If it's very clear that they are for the screen. I think we have to make two groups. One group for the display and one group for the basic functions. Yeah, but they're incorporated. Yeah, because this is used for both. Yeah. But maybe that's not... If you're zapping with your remote control, you can press the menu button and then you are suddenly into the... To your screen. Okay, so you should leave the menu button out of here. And just put it under the screen. Just group. Yeah, we make these advanced functions and these basic functions. We make a line between them. But we should place the screen on top, right? Well, oh yeah, okay. We swap the... You use the port. Yeah, you just find out and then the headlady is out. Do we do the extra two buttons or not? I think you should. It's easier if you put too many functions in one button, it gets confusing. Yeah, okay, that's true. So we have a menu button and a... Okay, in Beck. Yeah. Okay, in Beck. Yeah, our confirm and back. The four arrows. Yeah. But those are still doubly used. Should we save this picture or, you know, what it looks like? Yeah, I'm not clear about the extra two buttons. We have a menu button. Yeah, yeah. Just to activate the screen. Yeah, okay. So... So you button access the menu in the LCD screen. And then with these buttons, you can navigate. You navigate. Okay. But you can also navigate the channels and the volume. Okay, so that's not... Yeah, those are both... both. Hey, is it interesting for users if we put lead lights under the buttons so that if you... Press on the menu function, that only the buttons that are used for the menu are... Liden up, yeah. Yeah. That's very good ID. Five minutes. All right. Yeah, that's a good ID because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now which you can use. Yeah. And then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button. Yeah. Sure. Okay. Yeah. So... Anything else? Those buttons are lit up. But just one thing. Should we use those two then? Or only this two to scroll? And then use the two functional buttons to confirm to go into something. Oh no, we have to use this to adjust... Or some some bars. Or keep it optional because maybe you can... you know, go left, right and up and down. Yeah. Maybe we should use this also as an okay button still. And then just only a back button. Well, we have those buttons. The problem with the okay button in the middle is sorry. Yeah. Sorry. It's... If you're pressing up and down, you can easily press it okay once you're not already at your... Or maybe make one okay button... And one back. And one navigation button. Yeah. With the channel and the volume. Yeah. A multifunctional navigation button. Okay. That's what we decided. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So... You want to close down? Yeah. I want to close down. Sorry. Sorry. Not because it doesn't like you. But we have lunch break already. And then we can work for 30 minutes. We'll have to write very fast to make the minute. Yeah. And then we'll see. Alright. How long is the lunch break? I don't know. We have to ask all of me. Do we have to write down our stuff now? First lunch break. I believe that's first lunch break. Everything in my head now. Yeah. There you go. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yes. I think you can put a laptop back in the room. Yeah. Yes, sir. Time pressure. Okay. Yeah, it's a lot of pressure. Yeah. Sorry for my not finished presentation. Sorry. Yeah. We'll kick your ass later. Bring it on. I don't know if it works. You saved it. That's safe. Out of my head. Yeah. Okay. We'll see. Just shoot back my laptop. Smart board. Alright. You can use it. Yeah. You can open it with picture preview or stuff like that. Some maps with all the data we have. Yeah. I tried to organize it by these three. Yeah. Yeah. It's just my own map. Yeah. I don't really mind. I just put the minutes here. We'll see. But you've got some actual information. Yeah. That's in the functional design. Okay. Yeah. It's just basically what I just showed. Where do you get? Yeah. I got it by the only one. Yeah. Okay. I'm glad you're here. I don't do it. Okay. Alright. Yeah. Make me proud. I'll try to. So first we have a lunch break now. Yeah. Alright. I believe so. Oh, just ask. Mm-hmm. I don't know where she's at though. Okay.
