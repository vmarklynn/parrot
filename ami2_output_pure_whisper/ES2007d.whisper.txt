 Play those edible. Did you know that? It's definitely... Because kids... I used to. I've definitely eaten it before. I didn't know it was edible. But it's... it's shoe proof. Yeah. It's my edible because kids eat it. I don't know if it wasn't edible, but... Well, no more babies. Actually, that makes sense because I remember like... I don't know if my mom ever did it. I remember other people's moms making. I played over. You just like make the... You can use coloring and mix and stuff. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, it is. Yeah. Oh yeah. All right, everybody ready? Yep. Okay, let's have your... Let's get... Let's have the presentation. We've got a cool presentation. It's pretty exciting. So... Everything that we wanted, we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be... Made out of rubber. Very simple and easy to use. Double curved. Yeah, double curved. But also something that was going to jump out at people, something that would be different. Separate it from the other... Remotes out on the market. So... I think if you put this in the palm of your hand... You'll see what a nice thing we have going in. That is cool. So basically... If you hold it like that, the one on your thumb... The thumb button is the power button. Index finger is channel up. Middle finger is channel down. Ring finger is volume up. Pinky is volume down. What's the big blue thing? That's the lock button. And then the M is a mute button. And then it also has... So what button? M for muting the... And also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the channel if you want. So it's really basic functionality as far as what keys are available. But I think it's really comfortable and innovative and it looks different. That certainly does. So all the important keys are right at your convenient place for you to access them. And T-R-S-I-M. It should be... And it's also conformable to the size of your hand. I mean if that's too big, it's a rubber remote. It's so cute. Is that... What... I'm not sure what you guys were hoping for and expecting. I have one thing about it. But it's a small thing but it means we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one. How about it? That's good thinking. But that's... I don't see why that's not possible. If we build rocket ships, why can't we build rocket ships? Yeah. It might left-handed scissors. Yeah, but then... I didn't think about that. But then you can learn to use your right hand. Like I was just thinking there's left-handed and right-handed in the family. What do they have to do? I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole... The same computer for the first family and they have a mouse. Sure. Everybody using right-handed. I know they'll be able to... I mean it's only pressing buttons. You don't have to do anything, you know, extraordinary. I think everybody can press a button within the left-handed and right-handed. Imagine... are you right-handed? Yeah. Imagine doing it with your left hand. I don't think it's too... Yeah, it's not. But we can have both... Yeah. Have them in stock. Yeah. They can make them more appealing. But other than that, I only know. That's just something I think. I think it's great. Yeah, great idea. Do you think it says... R-I? R-I think it's a... I think it's... well, if the R-I motto is, we bring fashion to the electronics. We like to make sure that it could be quite fashionable. Yeah. And it's got the black and yellow and blue. Plus red, which is sort of a fruit and vegetable. That's how it is. Yeah. So that's our inner things. Yeah, very good. Yeah, it's come up with the thing that's... what we were looking at doing, wasn't it? Yeah. The little seems to be there. Well done. The little playing around is... Before we move on... Yeah, I'm just... do you want a bucket? I need that. Okay. Okay. Yeah. One thing I do need to do, we need to look at is the costs. The costs, is that what you said? The product was very cheap. Well, yeah. I don't want to last very long. Everybody will go like, oh, this is gone. But it's edible. Mm-hmm. Cheap poop. Well, buy more of the meat. That was the main criteria from the last meeting. It had to be cheap-proof. Yeah. Right. Okay, now I think we'll do this. Yeah. I could do, you know, I can do this. Oh. Oh, my, I could do it with you. But it's just easy enough to go through it with you. So, we're going for the... Kinetic power. Yep. And the electronics we decided on it. Being just a simple, the easiest thing that's inside it. Oop. The case we've gone for the double-curved. And it's made out of rubber. The interface is push buttons. And buttons supplements. Well, they're different special colors, aren't they? Yeah. So, very special colors. Special form. Special form. Yeah, they're special form. They're in shapes and stuff. Yeah, I mean, these ones on the side are curved. Yeah. They're made out of any special material. No, they're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber. They're just simple. Well, they're rubber. Okay. So, let's see if that comes within budget. And it does. That is going to cost... I don't know about it. Yeah, that's going to cost 10, 10 euros, 70 cents a unit to make. And our target was it had to come in at under 12.50. So... Actually, making a better profit than the expected. This is all very, very good. The bosses will be very pleased. Okay, let's just say this. So, I can email it to me. So, it's very dynamic. No, I want to... It's so... I'm not... I'm not... I'm not... I'm not... I'm not... Spended. Okay. So, that's... That's me done with this... with this... do-da. I'm going to do what you were going to do. No, evaluation. Oh, yeah. This is where we all get to. I get to write on the board. Oops, on the board. Right. Oh. It's functioned. Right. Okay. Oh, I love this man. I played on... Oh, I'm not... Oh, I'm not... Oh, I'm not... Oh, I love this man. I played on... I can't... I can spell it. Okay. So, evaluation. I'm going to do it all together. So, we evaluate it. Each criteria I've got the criteria is. And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven. One being true. So, it's more like it fits the criteria. And seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria. And the criteria is not... And I'll draw this up on the board. So, we have a box. Just so we know true. And this is false. This is just like... Keep you informed. So, seven is here. And one's here. And then you've got in the middle. So, the first criteria... Do you all get what we're doing? Okay, cool. Okay, first criteria. Look and feel. So, it does look and feel fashionable to what we talked about. Is it color-wise? And is it spongy? So, what mark should we give it for that? I would give it a seven. Yeah. As in, it's not. Oh, sorry. One. One. Yeah. So, I'll just write criteria. Criteria one. Criteria one. Second criteria. New technology. How we implemented new technology within the new high tech. Yeah. That was our main technological innovation. Everything else is fairly simple, but the fact that we use the kinetic energy. Also the... It's ergonomic. Yeah, but that's not a technological thing. That's another thing. That's another marketing thing. So, on the technical side of it. I'd say it's about a two-ish. In the middle somewhere, maybe. Three. Yeah. Three, yeah. Got a three. So, criteria three is... It's easy to use. I think it's a one. I'd say it's... I've not, if you're left-handed, it's not. I would give it a two. Two, so... Because it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people. But if we make a right-handed and left-handed then... If we're going to have one left-handed and one right-handed, then I would give it a one. Yeah. Give it a two. Yeah, okay. Okay, criteria four is... Cost. I mean, on the budget. Yeah, it's a definite one. That was great. Yeah. The amount of buttons... Like the amount of buttons, because people like a lot of letters. Only the necessary buttons. So it's a one? Yeah. Yeah. Um... Criteria six. RSI is a good against. Yes. Very good. It's an NC RSI. It's one. And criteria seven, which is the last one. Does it get lost? It's easy to get lost. I don't think it's going to get lost very freely. No. But it is flawless. It's not the kind of thing that's going to slip like between a couch cushion or something. Maybe it was. I think it would be good. It was a two. Yeah. I mean, it's not fully, it's not fully like, can't say. I mean, it's not a one. I mean, you can still flush it down a toilet theoretically. Yeah, anything. I mean, it's bigger than the average mobile, I guess. Yeah. But yeah, it can get lost. The mobile's getting lost all the time. Okay. But then you ring them. So. Okay. So that's that. That's the evaluation. So I'd say. Yeah. Oh, it's like, oh, system goes. Like a number one. Number one product. We can't fail. Fitted all the criteria. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well done, Lisa. That's that one. Okay. I think I just want to put in as projects manager. You know, a little bit of praise for everybody here. But how they've worked on it. You know, both individually and as a team. You've everyone's come up with their own individual ideas and their own different departments. And then come together and work in, you know, integrally, you know, at the right times, you know, especially you too. That's all, you know, gone very, very well and and. You know, it's been good communication going on. And during our design, and there was some some heated, heated discussion, but we kept trying to keep it cool and. Did you have to go down to the corporate squash court and bash a few bills about. We just had to squeeze our product a little bit. Fantastic. Now you guys have been a great team. I think we're the envy of all the, of all the other teams. I think so, I think we've come up with something new, something that hasn't been done before. We're not just rehashing an old design. And for meetings, for the old design, the meetings could be this quick. You know, maybe this isn't a simulation. Maybe this is actually, it's like, I think they're so mean or someone like that. They're just, yeah. They get the. Yeah. Yeah, well, two years time, this will be on the market. Exactly that product. And we'll go, yeah, we design that and no one will believe us. So at this stage, I mean, is this the last meeting of the project? We don't have another one after it's gone. No, I think when this meeting's finished, like officially, they'll, we'll get a questionnaire. Oh, really? Just start summarizing now. I can reply to the same list. I'm got the message. See some way. Just reply to that one. So there's no way to like predict what our, because we had it, we originally had it. As far as our financial goals, we had a specific number for profits that we wanted. It was 50. Was it, was it still your five? I don't remember, but there's not a way to compete that. I mean, since we saved on the, on that production cost, do we know how much we're making on profit? It gets handed over to another department. Well, what our project was was to come up with the product. Basically, like the, and just basically is it, can, can, is it within budget? When it, when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and, you know, the, the profits and all that, that's other departments. It's another team that actually work out the, the, we have a vested interest in that. Oh, yeah. The all that goes in the profit sharing. Yeah. Yeah, that's it. You know, we've, we've, we've made, we've designed the product. We've made, we've got the prototype. It's within budget. It's, does everything that we wanted it to do. It's new. It's, it's something that, that is now there already. I think actually in one advantage of this is that after the, you know, after this bad of fruit and vegetables passes, this will still be a cool remote, you know, we're not, we're not, you know, tying our cart to that one horse. Yeah. But this is very remarkable. And that it is, it's, it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people to want that. It's, that it's, I'm bringing it all right down here somewhere. Oh, I put it in one of my emails that I sent off. That, you know, it's marksable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes are actually do give you a pest is strain injury. Our one does the complete opposite. You know, so that's something that's new, which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something new and makes watching TV healthy. Yeah, and if you're not having a good time with the TV, you can throw it about, you know, it's fine. It's kid proof. Don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them. Well, you can break the ornaments, but you won't break that. No. Yeah. So all in all, I think we've done very well. Well done everybody. Yeah. You too. In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're, that we've all just gained access to. That's it. That's it. Well, as far as I know, that's it. I've got five minutes left. No. Everyone want to play us by? I guess it's probably better than we wrap it up and have five minutes of silence. Should we call it a day then? Yeah, I guess. I mean, we're going to get asked to fill out another questionnaire. It's probably going to be the same as one we've done before. Well, I'm not the authority to say that it is. How does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this? Sort of using the pens and writing on these special pads and all that? I love it. I love it. I think it's cool. You know, wide up vibrating pen and cool. Being watched. Your moment to shame. Well. You know, I didn't, yeah, as we said earlier, I've not never seen that before. Something that the whiteboard thingy. That's great. But a pen with a camera on it, I don't think it's such a new thing. I mean, it's all in such a new idea. It would be different if it was sort of handwriting, recognizing stuff. But as it's not, it's literally that will come up on the computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text. Right. I think they do want to give me an writing mechanism. Yeah. It's just that we're stuck. Logitech. I guess we should end this as well. Off topic. Yeah. Meeting the joint. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
