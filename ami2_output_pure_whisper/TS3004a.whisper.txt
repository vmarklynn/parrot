 Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. You have to put exactly on the plate. Good morning. Should I bring my pen to? No, that's for me. I do. Come on. There we are. My laptop is crashing. Damn, come here. Help, help, help. Let's just check one more time. Can't hear me. I don't know. Check. Okay. Test, test, test. Yes, it's warm. So you already know what we're going to do or not? Mm-hmm. Okay. I'm going to make a remote control. I think my laptop is a bit......echie. I'm going to make a presentation. We also put some things in it. Okay. How does this work? I don't know. One, a host and write. That's my name. We're going to make a remote control. We're going to have a look at our meeting. You know this is about 25 minutes. The first thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do. We also read what these things are not yet. It has to be original training user-friendly. First, we have three steps of making the remote control. The first thing is in the functional design. It's very important. We have to look at what the needs are, the effects of the functional design and how the remote control works. That's where we're going to look in the functional design is for the next meeting. The second thing is the conceptual design. That's the specifications of the components and properties and the specifications of the user interface. We have to look at what the market is doing for what kind of remote controls are in the market. The third thing is the detailed design. That's exactly how it looks. These are two smart boards. You know all the here can put things in the project map folder. We have to look at that one. You can read. We have to use different pen colors and different thickness of the pen. First, to show you, maybe you can come here to have a look how it works. You can use pen format and different colors. There's no pink. I'm going to draw with an elephant. Just draw it slowly because otherwise it won't work. It's a very nice elephant. It looks very nice. Something like this? It's a pink elephant. This takes a little bit slow. You can see this is a bit annoying. You can draw a painting. Use it like that. You can use it. It has to be water. The water is important. It's a fish. Wow. This is so weird. Beautiful. You can use it. You can roll up faster and faster. Let's make it a dog. Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back. I think it's a pig. Pig? No, it's a dog. A sheep? Not a hat. We only have 25 minutes. Take it easy. I make a cat of it. I was going to make a cat too. You should find the jig. Not too quick. Hold it more to the back. I just draw it too quick. More? That's okay. Thank you. Just to get used to it. Okay. I thought these pens would be just... You write it down and you download it to weird. You already did it or no? No, I tried it. You really got to write on that paper. I thought it would be just in the type of words. It's just a picture. It's not that cool. You can't edit it. Okay. It's a donkey. I don't know. I think it was... I think it was... I think it was ten. Brilliant. Thank you. This is definitely the last one. Okay. What we know is that we have to sell this remote control for about 25 euros. Excuse me. We have to make a profit of 50 million euros. We have to use a big market in Europe. The prediction goes up at half the price. Easy. Can someone make a calculation about how many we have to sell these to make 50 million? We're going to have a little discussion about what experience our remote control of first of these. We think about remote controls. My first question was, does it have to be universal remote control? Oh, yeah, that's a good question. Because we sell it only from the... Not with the television. We sell it apart. I think it's not sure. It probably would be universal. Not only in television. I don't think you can buy a universal remote control for 25 euros. Not sure. Yeah, I know you can buy universal control. Okay, so you just say it's universal remote control. And also for the PCR and DVD player. Everything. Okay. So a lot of buttons on the... Yeah, probably. Not just the TV. No, just everything. Okay. So what's the remote controls? It's a black thing with some buttons on it. It's not nothing very special. But... Well, we can try to make it special. Yeah, that's right. So do you have any ideas how it has to look for usability or use it? I've talked about making it the same as style as the television, which is... We don't have the same television all the time. And that's no matter. If we control the PCR and DVD player with it, it has to be clear. Because kids and elderly are going to use it. So it's not only for the technical persons. I think it must be a very good control so you can use it from everywhere in your room. The infrared thing must be from very good quality. That's right. It should be a good point. Okay. Nothing frustrating then. And how big should it be? Yeah. I don't know. It shouldn't be too big, but I don't think we can make it too small because it has to have a lot of functions. We can't make it smaller than things we see now, I think. Just big enough for the buttons we have. Yeah. We have to make something like mobile phones that you can... Full and open. Maybe then you can make it smaller and be unique. Yes. Maybe more trendy. You think about one you can... Full and open. Maybe for the DVD player or something. Yeah. Or you can just general things like volume and TV channels and inside things you don't use that often. You can also use a small touch screen on the remote control. Yeah. Why should you use a touch screen on the remote control? Maybe it's a manual in it. Yeah. Or maybe to keep it easy and small. Okay. Why can't you do it too expensive to put a touch screen on it? Yeah. Maybe it would... It's not reachable, I think. Touchable. And we have to care for the strength of the remote control. Yeah. Because remote controls are most things in the house that falls down on the ground and get often broken. And if you have a touch screen in it, it's definitely too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And how about the batteries? Should you put it in a recharger or... Oh, maybe that's a good idea. Maybe a home station. Put it on your television and just recharge. You never have to use any batteries. Yeah. That's a good idea. But yeah. We have to look at the price. Yeah. How expensive is a normal recharger? Well, how much is your standard mobile phone recharger? Yeah. If you buy it separately from your phone, it's probably expensive. I don't know what the projection costs are. Maybe if you look at the market, it's probably still the best way just to put batteries in because maybe it's too expensive. Yeah. Yeah. But the home station is a really good idea because lots of people lose their remote control and don't know where it is. Yeah. And now you can prove it always at the same place. Yeah. Maybe it's... Therefore, it's a good idea, but maybe it's expensive. Maybe use it as a separate option. Yeah. Separate. You can buy it with... Yeah. But I have a mouse that's also rechargeable. Yeah. And you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station. Or you can change your batteries. Yeah. So. The option. Just the option. That's cool. I said something on paper already. Size, looks, usable. The buttons on useful places. The home off button must be on top. Yeah. It has to lay good in the hands. You have to... Has it has to be... Does it have to be like a different form than normal remote control? I don't know. I think we have to look at that. Because you can do it at the standard way. You can make it very special to create our own looks. But it's very hard. If we want to make it special, we probably have to do a lot of testing if it really works. Well, you can have basic things on the same place. Like on off button on top and the TV channels one, two, three, four. As a block. Yeah. And then the volume obviously on top so you can see. But the rest is... You don't use that often. So if you have a clear button with a good icon on it, it should be clear as well. So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control, I think. So you can do something unique with that. And what we have to think about too is buttons that you use often are maybe like when you fall it open, when you have it closed, you can still do the functions. Yeah, on top of the... Yeah, but the basic options on top. Basically when I'm watching TV, I'm just using like five buttons or so. Maybe it's very hard to make it full open and to look like it's very... Very nice. If you make it full open, it's also the strength. It's not as good as a normal one. No, that's right. So maybe you have to keep it like a square. It's normal remote control. Okay, but yeah. I think we have two closes to finish this meeting. Okay. There's some more things. We have another 30 minutes. So then we're going to meet again. So you know what you have to do? Okay. Yeah. For me, the marketing expert, the user requirements specification, do I need to think as a user, as only the looks and what you want to do with it? Yeah, I think if you have to know if it's for a DVD player, all the things. Okay. Also from a user, but... Yeah, there's also about strength. It's also down some... Five, three, ten, one. Yeah, no, maybe not not not strength. That's not something for him. Yeah, that's not for you. Okay. Just if what's in the market, what's normal, what kind of... Do you want to do this remote control? What do you need on the remote control? All right, all right. All right, all right. We wrote some down. Some of these. Yep. Yeah. Just... Is that okay? Okay. There's already a document in the......folar. Yeah, me too. So, see you in 30 minutes. Okay, well, okay. Okay. For the next time you have to put it exactly on the square. So, you're left on... Oh, Paul. Didn't say that. No, sorry. You're a fault. Joe. I'm sorry. Bye, Paul. Bye, Paul. Okay.
