 Okay, so now that we've all had a bit of time to think about it, does anyone have any concrete proposals or do we want to just go through people and start placing them? Can you discuss as we go along? I don't think there are concrete proposals. No, it's kind of, we should maybe find a message to do stuff. Like, I don't know, choose one parameter. The first parameter is to choose people, to choose where to put people. Like, I don't know, maybe permanent staff and permanent staff. We know that professor will stay for a long time. We don't know for the other. So maybe that could be the first parameter to take into account, just to have these dis... Comfortable officers. Yeah, and have this discussion every two years. Yeah. Because, you know, that's my sense. That makes sense for everyone. So we can choose where to put the three first ones of the least. Yeah, there's Mark times with professor, but he's only here half time. So it's sort of a different situation. We have a professor at the EBFL, but not in Geneva. He just does research in Geneva. And maybe the two of us are senior Andrei and Nancy. Yeah. Okay, so let's go through that first. So what do you think for Susan and Nike, for example, the dorms for one person? Yeah. Yeah, I'd like to be a good lady. The first season probably had an essential choice to have her own office. Okay. Any preferences to which one? Not really. I think it's Susan here for now. And then Maggie and the other one? Yeah. It's not too bad, I guess. Yeah, it's up to me. Yeah, it's up to me. They're not here. They're not here. They can switch to other... Okay. And then... All right, Max. So we need to put Pierre and Nancy. The question is now, is do we want to put the three together? Or the three completely separate with other people? I would say not together. And the parent has gloat points. Yeah. And then, Andrea and Nancy don't. Yeah. Does that one turn? Some. Some. Yeah, but few. Less than Karen. Yeah. Do we have them? It's also, we're going to put people together by projects. And we just had a sense to put them together. So we're kind of from projects. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I just realized something. Mm-hmm. The two people room in the middle, which has only one window is... Yeah. It's going to be pretty hard to put two people inside that room. Because of that window. Yeah. It's called dog. What if I'm moving to Zella in there? She's in there half the time. She can have her desk near the window. Okay, she's not near the mailbox. Yeah. And near the photography. And there may be more sort of practical in terms of working environments for people. Yeah. You have a pretty nice room. And what about the reading room? Like I'm one of the reasons for being reading the room. Yeah. But you, I mean, I think everybody is supposed to spend more time in their office than in the reading room. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. It changed the plan of the morning. I'm sorry, but I just realized that stupid architects put only one windows. Who built this building? Do we know that? Maybe. I don't know. What do you think? I don't know. We spent quite some time at the last meeting and to decide the no-no. But in the last meeting, you just took attention at this one windows problem. And I think it is one problem. Of course. But everybody has the documents before, so you could have studied them. Yeah. I can say the same to you. You said that there's electricity. What do you think people that are 50% in that room? The two APFL people? Yeah. That's really welcoming and warming. They're only here 50%. Yeah. So how are we going to fill the three person rooms? What? What? What? Fade again. Who are we going to put in the three person rooms? I mean, we have now two three person rooms left. And... You know, the main problem, we have the same number of plates and the same number of people now. So everyone has to go somewhere. And I just noticed that we have these two people room. And also have one three person rooms? One window. Two windows. I don't mind going into this office. You don't mind to have... I think it's volunteers. Okay. Nikos. And you have to sign... Yeah. You have to find somebody agree to come with you. And it's not a question of you. It's a question of windows. Who would you put with you? Let's put a 50%. Oh, why not? Okay. From the end. Yes, that's what David. Yeah. You know David? Oh? You will learn to know. You'll meet him. Okay. So... I'm just gonna... Like a list on here. Okay. Aren't you talking? So David and Nikos is done. And we... So where were we? We met... And I'm Nancy. And I'm Nancy. Maybe we can put Pierre-Ade and her two PhD students into one room. Yeah, why not? How many PhD students do you have? Oh, two more rooms. And me. Okay. You can say. Okay. So how many? So how many? So how many? So how many? Yes. There's the no's. Officially. Um... Okay. So David, Nikos, Chizawa, Maggie, and Susan are done. Okay. So, and could you put the map again? Yeah. Um... That's... That might be a good idea to put Pierre-Ade with two PhD students. Okay. Whoever they are. Should we be nice and give them screen windows? Um, yeah, maybe the other one would be more convenient if we're all working on the same project. So we're close by. Okay. Oops. So, Pierre-Ade and the two Marians. That won't get confusing. Yeah. I'd like to have a view to the mountains, but... So what could be with Marian and Fred? It's all right. And we put Marian in front. And she wants to do... Where? Here? No. On the room of the opposite. Oh, no. It's actually all the town of you. Well, that's... That would be here. Or the other street person room. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Pick her room. The old town is as well. Is that all right? Yeah, that's all right. I got one of those. She's not that far if she's in this one here. And that's good because there are... Pierre-Ade, Marian, and Niko's there on the other side of the corridor. So it's... Yeah. Okay. So Marian, and who do you want to work with? Who's there? Erm... Nancy Martin... Pierre-Ade, no, Pierre is there. Andre, Yelena, Marian, and Agnes. Yelena would be great. I'd like to let this work in for the same project as well. Okay, so put to Yelena with... And the beautiful laughter. Yeah. Okay. And we have... Erm... Now... Do you think it's a good idea to put Martin and Andre together since they are working on the same project? Yeah. That could work. I don't know when Martin was just 50% in. Yeah. And we might put Martin and Andre and someone else in the street person who... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I guess I can go in there because Martin and I were working on sort of the same thing. Okay. Okay. And that leaves... Maria and Nancy. That's... That's... That's one? Yeah. That's a weird combination. Why? So, what do we think about that? Why don't we move Maria to where... I'm supposed to be and I can go with Nancy. No, I'm not that it's just... You've almost got like a project split except that you don't because... Nancy and Maggie and I work on permanently... In the permanentlys. You know. And then Andre Martin and Maria and I also work on I am too. And so does Susan. Although, the Susan and Maggie can't do anything. I think this project thing is not a good thing. This project is a good thing. No. Spitting by the project. But then we should split a little MSLT party. Yeah. No, but if you split by project you would mean one person room. I want your own. That's mine. I would put it the other way. I would put the room with Martin in it in the two window room. Because he's 50% so then at least the other two people get. Could you say that again? Put Martin in the three person room with two windows. Okay. Since he's 50%. Okay. So you just... You just move him or the two groups. Either way. Well, I don't know if we're splitting up. But is this about windows? Yeah, that's why I said that. If it's still not functional, if you and Martin work on the same project. Yeah. I mean, with whom... I'm trying to just want to... With whom you'd like to work in the same office. I mean, is this important to have someone from the same project? Or... I don't think it's necessarily so important to be in the same office or somebody. Yeah. If you're working on the same project. We can scribe each other. Yeah, we can scribe it. Because you can do lazy to get up and walk next to the part. We can disturb all the people by scyping all the time. I don't know. Like right now, I share an office with Gruner. We don't work on any projects together. Except coffee time and that's simple in the project. That's too good. That's a thing and stuff like that. That's fine. I don't need to be in the same office as someone who works on I&T or someone who works on front of me. It's not like... And it's quite funny to be outside activities around you and not always the same stuff. Yeah, that's for sure. Especially when it's activity that you don't understand or... No, I think that I am. You hear things out of contact, so... Yeah. I agree, but this said, I was pretty good now. But I do know it's not on my facility and sharing it. To my facility office, I'm not sharing somebody with... Yeah. I work on the same project. That's very nice. Yeah. I don't know you were saying that Maria Nancy doesn't fit... I just took care of her and said... I can't really see them sharing an office. So what do you say if you change the office... I don't know. Do you work with Nancy? I put Andre and Nancy together because they were starting that new project. Oh, yeah. For example. And then put Maria with me and her. I can see that working a bit better. Yeah, okay, well you're not. I'm not totally convinced. Sorry? I'm not convinced. No, I was not in... I don't know. Yeah, what is it now? I thought you were saying you didn't want to be in a three person room. Yeah. First of all, and then you're... No, yeah. From the beginning I said the three person room. It's a disadvantage. But if you were one of the people you had, then it would be on the... To change when the office is advantaged, we put somebody in the ticket center and then... Yeah. Yeah. You could do this. But they... You and they must have the window problem. Yeah. Which is why I still think we should put Jazella in that room because... Yeah. Well, I guess the window, the Stagier, whatever, he's there for two months. It's their problem. Yeah, and Stagier is here for working. Yeah, not for enjoying the view. Exactly. Well... Anyway, it's always freaking Geneva, so there is no view. They're at this having quite an unfounded situation because they're a Marianne and Pono who are having your reception and all of those. Yeah, but that's so it's a... It's a huge... My inheritance as well, we all have a different... Yeah, so it's quite a traffic there. Yeah. So what if we switch, you know... Well, will there be wireless in the building? I mean, if there are reception hours, so somebody could move to the reading room and have people... You have to have a computer as far as... Well, isn't this the case? Doesn't everybody have some? No. Well, most of us first of all have desktop computers, so... Well, I think I've been doing this. This can prove with you this. Plus, you can't assume that you can just use the reading room for reception hours. No. All right, like, people are actually using it as a reading room. I think most of them have a room for reading or... So what... Can we say we're going to move to Salah here? Yeah. Okay. And then... I think that gives us a little bit more flexibility to play with... Yeah....in the name people are... Okay, can we say that David......those here? Yeah, instead of... You were the first one on the list, but if you wanted to move someone... Why would I move someone else? No, because I was thinking of we can......having these two of us which are near to the list......give this office for reception people. I'm sorry, it's so funny. We are Pierre-Het, the Tumarian, N.I....our receiving and Maggie and Susan, our receiving young enough students. So what if we... So we... With the finish, for example, if you want... Well, you're... Will you have... I already speak quite well finished, so... Yeah, so that's good. Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay. Look at that. Yes, I... I'm just playing Iliana and... Yeah, yeah. That's nice to have a corner, a student... I mean, a student area... You know what I mean? It's easy for them to... Yeah, to find us. And it's also quite noisy when you have this kind of......parietal students, before the exams. So you should work. And you have this. So it goes in Iliana. Yeah, we're doing that somewhere else. I'll follow that. So when the photography is still... Yeah. Yeah, we have to put it on one, and the other side of the......but it will. You just have to have a copy. Yeah. Yeah, who does anyway? Yeah, the people have any students. Yeah. So maybe you and Bruno should take this office. Nobody's too far from here. Well, you have the other... Yeah. Left. Okay. Yeah, if we change the switch, three people......Perek, Maria, and her baby. With here and... Yeah. That's a good idea. That's a good idea. That's a good idea. And then, yeah. We have three windows. We have three windows. We do enter into it. That's what the plan is. We have the moment to see us. To get the photocopying noise. Now we're all going to come for the copy. We just don't know what you do. We do some very healthy things around. And bathroom's on you, but yeah. Yeah, and... Okay. I think that's a good idea. Or did......was the idea......I just start making full sentences. What about... I was thinking about moving Perek and Maria into a two-person office rather than a three-person office. And then... And put David......with Andrea Nancy, for example. He had two-person office. No, the three-person office. And why? Because if they have reception... I know I thought you were saying that Perek should have a smaller office......or be in a small office because of reception or something. Or do those completely misunderstand? No, no. The reason to put David and Maria and Perek, and to put mine and I together is because of the noise we make by... Oh, okay....receiving student. And then the reason to put David in the South is because... Look at this 50%. Yeah, it's 50% in a street. Okay. That works. Place office. That sounds nice, no? Yeah, it sounds good. Mm-hmm. Can I think we do have the best office? Yeah, I think too. I'm quite happy with that. I'm playing the victory ship decision. We are here to make a decision. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And Agnes, you're going to sell this to the administrator. Yeah, I'm going to try, yes. Yeah, so... Okay. What arguments do I need? Well, we have the... The arguments of students. Yeah. The group and students here. You can know... Although you still have Susan and Maggie over here. Oh, yeah. Yeah, but it's quite logical to have the......for the professors. Yeah. Yeah. One person who's......in the room. Mm-hmm. So this sort of a... Well, no, it's not a project. It's weird because it kind of isn't. It kind of isn't. Because Maria and Martin and I all work on the same project. Yeah. And then Andre and Nancy were on the same project. Yeah. And then Andre and Nancy were on the same project. Yeah, but we all work on the same project. Yeah. So it comes... That is a little square. It took......always a print time. And there's a little... Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Let me just write down the arguments for why......student results. Yeah, one suggestion. If possible, we could move Mimi and Jelina to the office where Andre and Nancy are now. You just want a bigger window. No, it's just more convenient to come closer with my user partners on my project. Okay. Wait, I'm sorry. I see you slow too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Happy? Yeah. Happy? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So the argument is, um......student reception in one format. So that's a nice reduction. Yeah. 50% staff industry. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think they have an interest in the three......c...the other project. Yeah. Yeah. Now they are, yeah. Yeah. I am... Except for David, because I do think that. And the two professors are one singer. And well, she's low, she's kind of in the middle. Yeah, she's the heart of the singer. Yeah, part of the... And since you will meet the administrator, can we ask for a coffee machine somewhere? In the reading room, that's what they get. Yeah, in that hall. I mean, the sixth floor. There's no coffee machine. It's not the case. It's... I mean, like... A little machine or a vending machine? No, a vending machine. The little machine, I think, would be harder to smell. But... There's... I don't know. We have a coffee. We have a coffee. We have a coffee. We have a coffee. Yeah. Italian one, please. But strong. Strong, strong, good coffee. Yeah. And hope. Good, strong. Yeah. Would you say hot tea? Hope tea. Oh, hope tea tea. Yeah. It's with strong coffee, I don't sleep. If you wait... Yeah. If you work late, yeah. And to drink. Yeah. Yeah. And do we know if there will be a conditioning? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do we know if there will be a conditioning? Is there actually a smoke in your area somewhere? Not for me. Not for me. Yeah. But we... Okay. We have the terrace still. No. No. There is no terrace on that building. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Exactly. I'm assuming I'm like you. Of course I will. Yeah. Okay. Okay. That's a nice thing. I think it's fine. Okay. Okay. Okay. I think... Yeah. Okay. I think it's fine. I think it's fine. Okay. Yeah. I think it's fine. I think it's fine. Thank you. My username is here. Thank you. Let's see what the... So when exactly are we supposed to know? In three weeks. So they've set up everything wiring, internet or what's the size of the model? As far as I know, basically we packed up one day the movers kind of take all our stuff, put it into the right boxes. So when you get there the next day all your stuff is already in your office and all the IPs and everything is set up. They're trying. So we'll see. Make sure you label your boxes to help really. Especially the Marianne's. Yeah, so they don't confuse the other Marianne's box. Then we think of putting a white sword somewhere in the hole for general information. We can try. I can't ask for the idea. Well, maybe most of course they can man. But they mean you have a nice poster of the next conference. Okay, yeah. A big box. Yeah, sure. Who wear like a long. Along one of the others. Or in front of a ring. Yeah. Lots of walls. Okay, so along that bottom. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Anything else I need to ask? No. No. Special. Okay. Anything else I need to ask? No. Special. No. No. No. Actually, we may need to sort out. That's not healthy. I don't know if we need to sort out who sits where. Because if they're going to plug everything and set everything up. Anything else everybody's going to have a message to find. Yeah. They prefer to be in front of the window or whatever. Yeah. I mean, if we start doing that and then we go on to market. I don't know if we can afford us or not, but we can change it, I guess. Okay. No, take that. So you just. And you may look popular for that to everybody. Yeah. Not right now, because I'm not going to the internet. But anyway. Okay. Okay. Okay.
