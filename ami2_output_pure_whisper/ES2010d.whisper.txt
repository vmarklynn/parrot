 I want to find out if our work works. Me too. Oh. So I... What do you think? Here's the agenda for our last meeting. After the opening, we're going to have a prototype presentation. Then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote. Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process. And then we're going to close it up and we have 40 minutes. So... Sorry. Oh. Nope. Let's have a prototype presentation. Okay. Ready? Sure. You are me. Yee. You read that stuff since you wrote it. Well, since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for. I'm just going to translate what this all means for you. The base is going to be gunmetal-glory, which is what we decided. It's going to be plastic. Then there's the latex cover, which is what you see as red. Because it can be replaceable, we just kind of went with the color. Right. And then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top. And the buttons will be much lighter blue. Almost see-through. And the whole thing lights up, you should press any button rather than just that one button or a light up. And then at the bottom we have our logo. Bright yellow is sort of designed with the RR, which will actually look like our logo. And then on the side you have the buttons. And they're one button, but they kind of push up and down. Okay. And then they're screwing. Nope. They're just buttons, right? Yeah. And then the buttons. On-off switch will be here. And as you've noticed on our prototype, they've ended up with a curvature kind of biconcave sort of thing, because I can't see underneath. So I'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that, because they're very nice to stock. Stick your fingering. The two squared buttons are to probably least used menu, mute. And then these are the numbers. So our channel and our volume will be on either side. And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labeling on top. Just... And did you determine the curvature of the bottom part of it, or the hand is going to be a single or a double? It's a single, single, single, single, single, because it's not big enough to really constitute a double. It's only actually the size of my hand. Great. I think you did an awesome job. Yeah, I think it's beautiful. It is beautiful. And it's everything that we discussed. Yeah. Good job, you guys. Good job. That was really good. All right. What's next in our agenda? We're going to discuss the evaluation criteria, and that's with Courtney. Okay. It's PowerPoint presentation. I don't really know exactly what we should talk about. It's under evaluation. Right. All right. So these are the criteria we're going to ask. Is it easy to use? Is it fashionable? Yeah, I guess we should write these down. We should reference them. Feel good meaning or? Like, does it feel good? Physically. Yeah, physically. That's just for current trends. Right. It doesn't really count, you guys. Yeah, it's a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it. Yeah. But so we do have removable covers, right? Yes. Yeah, well then that's correct. And so we can, everybody have that? Oh, wait. Yeah, she's got it. Yeah. Okay, so we're using the criteria for some point scale. And so we need to discuss how we feel it falls within this range. So for easy to use. Do we feel it's very easy to use? Are we going to? I say we individually, right? What do you guys just really? Why not? Okay. Okay. Easy to use. I vote six. Oh, wait. That's false. Two. Okay. I'd say two as well. Yeah, two. Two. That's what I say. Hello. We're great. Okay. Fashionable. At the moment? No. No, I mean like no. I think it's very fashionable. Very chic. I would give it a one. One. I'll give it a two because at the moment it's not looking that way. Well, that's just like a prototype. That's a clay. It's a prototype. What do you think? I don't know if that's a life. Give it like three or four. Okay. So the average is about a two. Yeah. Two. Two points. That's okay. Yeah. All the customers we have. Does it feel good? Imagine. Since we obviously don't have that. I feel like the shape of it actually does. And it's it is very ergonomically designed. It's going to be curved. Yeah, that's going to be thicker. Yeah. I think it feels good. I think so too. I'll give it a two. Okay. Two. I'll give it a one. What do you say? I'd say two. I can average just two. Is it technologically innovative? I'm sorry, I'm taking over your job. Oh no, it's fine. You're writing it. You're a project manager. Yeah. I mean, does it have voice? I mean, the phrase recognition on it? Yes. Right. We were able to do it with that kind of chip. Oh, right. We could do it with the chip. Yes. It wasn't. We had no reflection of it. There's no reflection of it on the prototype. Right. That's because it's way too dimension. And we discussed that. Yeah. Right. So then yes, then I would, well, it doesn't, what else would it need to be technologically innovative? Well, we don't have the, you know, we can't say channel. It changes the channel. And it doesn't cover anything other than TV. Right. So I'd probably give it a three. Yeah. Okay. Even though it is for just a TV remote, it's very advanced. But it is just a TV remote. Yeah. I'd go for a three or four on that one. Okay. Let's go for a three point five. Three and a half. All right. And the last criteria, is it, is it. Squishy and fruity. Well, we've covered that with these. We'll try and do you base it. Yeah. So I'd give it a two. It's capable of being. Oh, very, very beautiful. Squishy and fruity. Okay. And it's very important. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Next. So, our model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be winner. And hopefully we'll sell millions. Good job team. How did you get that in there? What? Slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie. It does. It was good. Thanks. Very good. All right. Let's go back to this. No. That's it. Oops. Okay. So now we're moving on to finance. Okay. I'm going to show you an Excel spreadsheet. And we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under 1250 euro. If so, we can proceed. If not, we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit. Okay. Let me bring that up. Here we go. All right. It's not a hand on. It's powered by battery. Yep. So we give it a two number of components you plan to use. Did I just put quantity being one battery or? Do you want to go for this is where we need to make the final call. If it's a lithium or you want to go triple A's because triple A's we're going to have to do more than one battery. Oh, let's just go for it. Lithium. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do a lithium. I think we're going to be able to purchase this are going to be technologically advanced. Right. Yeah. Okay. Down to the electronics section. We're going to need this kind. Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Voice sensor. So one of those. It is a single curve. So one of those. Oh, what's that? Yeah, that's correct. Okay. Down here. Voice material. Plastic. And special color. Okay. Down here. Interface type. We're going to have the integrated scroll. Scroll. Oh, those are just regular. But it's a push button too. Right there. Yeah. So integrated scroll wheel or push button. We're really having just push button interface. Okay. So we can just go. Okay. Okay. But will we. Actually, we'll need to won't we one for the top and then one for this one for each side. But that just covers the type of button we're having. Because we're not doing a scroll on the side. So push button. I think that 29 means like you have both scrolls and push button. Right. I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put like here. Because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not going to be on the same plane when you press the button. You have to be additional signals on the side. Okay. So is that going to be an extra one on each side? I don't know. That might put us well. Let's just. Two or three because of one each side and one on top. I mean, it's fine. It comes out the same as 29. We'll less than 29. Okay. And we're going to button supplements. The buttons are not their special color. Okay. They're special form. They're indented. Right. And there's special material. Well, we're under costs then. Over. Over. 12.5 is our limit. Got 11.2. So we can go to production. We can go to. I don't know what I just did. Okay. Now we're going to talk about the project process and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result. Did we have a lot of room for creativity? Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership? Teamwork and the means, meaning technology that we use to produce our little guy there? And if we found a new ideas. Now, the question is how do we do this? Go back. I think we just discussed it. Discuss, sure. All right. Who would like to go first? I think we got stifled for creativity by the company itself. In restricting assembly to using a TV remote. Initially. Oh, that's true. And no internet. Yeah. No, yeah, that's a good point. Because I've forgotten that that was an art decision. Yeah. And how did you feel about the whole process though? Oh, overall, I mean, I thought we did a good job. Like, we got to choose basically a control over minus of being just merely a TV remote. We got to choose what we wanted to do with it. Right. And we got to say over how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable. Which I kind of am more fashionable for like technology. Yep. That's right. What about the teamwork aspect? How did you guys enjoy making the model the prototype? I think we did well. Yeah. I think you did. Did you work well together in there? Well, no, there was someone fighting. They were scratching it. Oh, my. And we've all been a pretty congenial team here. I think we have many many. I mean, I'm fine with you guys being like, what is it? The survey annoying or irritating? Wow, that's a definitely a strong one. Okay. The means the whiteboard didn't work. Yeah. I'll go into that. Have to knock that one down. Yeah, no, I'll just. And her friend here really feels strongly about the internet. And they're so much available. The digital panels. Yeah. Digital panels. They were really fine. Yeah. They're fun. You know, I'm not really sure what I could do with them, but they are awesome. These are the laptops for receiving everything. Right. Wireless too. Wireless. And that we have a shared network where we can put all of them. Yeah. And let's not forget sexy dual microphones. Yeah. And big brother. Big brother. Yeah. Okay. Have we found any new ideas through this process? We are really going to sell this. For something that looks cool and also has what I want it to do technologically. And that's your right brain taking over wanting the artistic, the fashionable, the hip. You know, if we all just went out and bought useful things, I don't think. I mean, that's why I don't like a Max or apples, just because I look at it. I know it's probably a very good computer, but I look at it and I'm taking back to elementary school because they look the same. They look like they did when I was in elementary school. Yeah, because they're pretty and just like the term of district school would only use his Max with their kids exactly. So I associate them with like really low tech, really cheap back font. Yeah. But I do like I pods go for you. Yeah. No, I pods. They want all those words for you. I pods are now quite trendy and they come in different colors. Exactly. I mean, how many people went out and bought a Nokia phone back when we were like in high school, just they could get the changeable faceplates. Oh, yeah. Everybody. Anyway, so that. I didn't have a phone until you got one issue. It's just like the whole it's for TV only. I was like, who's going to buy a remote just for the TV unless they've lost theirs. Look at it. That is a fashionable sheet. People. Whoa. Working director says, yeah. Special people. Working has to actually create the desire for it. Oh, I will. That's okay. We can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met. This will help them find the one. They'll be sexy with it. We have a type of commercial and that's the fig leaf. Okay. That'll sell. And so the serpent says use our remote. Yeah. No. Okay. We're going to wrap this up now. The costs are within the budget. We evaluated the project and now we're going to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary and then we're going to have a big giant party parent like four to this. So. Great. Thank you, team. Great job. It was lovely working with you. You too. Yay. Thanks to the project leader. Yeah. We knew.
