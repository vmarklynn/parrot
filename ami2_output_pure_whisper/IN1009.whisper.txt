 like this to the radio Okay. Okay. Maybe I'll go back to your questions. Yes. So you were talking about the two-trans question? Yeah. Okay. And a little bit about some people moving with the clustering. And this also allows you to separate people. The questions I did not talk about was going from location to identity of the person. That is quite different. You need to use the signal you have separated and do the type of analysis I mentioned from the spectrum. You can transform the magnitude spectrum and build model of the person. Well, actually this one. Yeah. Yeah, pitch at least. But pitch is not enough sometimes. Is there a pitch at the frequency? It's a frequency, yeah. It's a frequency of your vibration here. There is one frequency that is the base from the... Yeah. And then it's transformed through the mouth. That's the usual model. Okay. If you have both, you can compare this to one store and sort of get out which person it is. The pitch in the... And things that make the sound of the body. And you can measure that? Yeah. Yeah. It's not necessarily done explicitly, but it's equivalent to that. Yeah. So again, FFT is useful to do this type of analysis. I'm sorry, I didn't really get the point of comparing the pitch. The pitch is the frequency that is... Yeah. But it's quite personal, okay? And the way you transform it by the mouth? Yeah. If you were comparing white with white... The whole thing you had, everything that I don't know was... Okay. And that's really unique for my almost unique... And you were talking about comparing white with white. Well, once you get this information in frequency and your vocal contract... Yeah. Yeah. It's called... You can use this information to compare it to frame-seal. But you want to have the information because the mouth, you move it. No. It's an information equivalent to that. It's maybe... You don't need to do the whole complicated modeling. But can all the users have the... No, no, no. Everything is done through the voice here. You take a voice of someone and then you can get out this information. It's not clear, it's not perfect, but it's enough to use it for the different purposes. Okay. So you have the pitch and you have information about voice dynamic... Yeah. Right off the pitch is also possibility. Okay. So, how fast you speak. That's quite personal. But it varies over time depending on emotion. That also might be interesting for you detecting emotion. Emotion, the involvement in the discussion. Yeah. If you are... All right. Yeah. Yeah. So these measures are a way to quantify that. Is it expensive to do? Well, I think you may not that well, as far as I know. No, no, it's not. But in fact, actually you speak of a lot of things that are not expensive. What is more expensive is to take the decision finally. So your decision can be, for example, who is it? Or if the person moved, which is probably the most complicated thing, like the person goes away, then comes back ten minutes later, sits at a different place. You will need to build statistical models of the person identity using these measures. So the one he mentioned. I don't know if you're familiar with that. Is it called PCM? Well, it's not technology. It's more or less useless to compress audio. Yeah. I have to check it. I can show it to you afterwards. So, I'm not really familiar. Well, I did a course about it, but... Okay. So you are... I shouldn't say it too loud. The concert professor is working here, David. Yeah. Careful you are re-founded. Okay. I should read what I signed today. All these steps done from the FFT. Yeah. So we have to do FFT because otherwise... Also, location to identity. All I was saying is that these different measures are a way to evaluate the identity of the person. So with location, all you can do is extract segments of speech, for example. But it will not tell you that these are the same person. It's just a location. But you get a cluster of the location that is a place where no is regularly coming from. Yeah. So that might be good, for example, for 10 minutes. But then a person might move or a different person might come. But find something for a setting like here to be enough because we are not moving. This is, well, unless sometimes somebody goes there. Okay. But we are targeting a place where we don't know where it will be more flexible. So we need more than just location. If we want to... Yes. I'm even not sure if it's that important to know which person is talking. Because if you think about tables as something physical, you just want to know which cone of the table... I agree. Maybe the beach is coming and not which person produces speech. Yes, it is important for detecting patterns. Because if you say, let's say, how much the person I've spoken over the five last minutes. Yeah, but it's not really related to the... Sorry. I see it's... If someone comes... But that you can do with location if it's only on the short term. Yes. Yes. I think it may be okay, but it depends on the offer. Yeah. I would say you might use these measures in a simple way if you do it online. Like to give feedback. But you mentioned that another side of your project is also to analyze offline. So there you might want to use... Cesar. We had a student here, he finished one or two years ago, but he left his software. And his software is precisely to do that to cluster at another level to cluster these small clusters. Of speech. Group them by person automatically. From the location? No, from these measures, pitch, etc. Also... Sorry. This is only based on... You give the spectrum. Yeah, exactly. Okay. So I would say from location and the lower level, you can get small parts of speech. And then at the next level, possibly offline, you can group them into speech segment. I'm hoping to have enough time to try doing that before I finish my thesis. So if I manage to do some practically usable software, I'll tell you. When are you planning to finish? Oh, in five, six months, approximately. But the last months are always the... More extensible. Not really. More busy, I would say. So you said you want to do separation. But... I don't know how much. Maybe we would be more interested to know that it's not the same people more than knowing that it's the same people. Or to detect that someone is more that was not talking before, is talking now. Okay. I said we want to do separation just because of the voice recognition. Are you want to do voice recognition? This is not the... You might want. Yes. You might want to do everything. In fact, we are designing a sensitive table just from your ring, but we are also designing a prototype to analyze the conversations. Okay. So we might add a lot of features. So once you have locations, it's not a big problem. Okay. And I don't know, perhaps... Perhaps if you have two people speaking at the same time, I don't know if voice recognition on such a stream is... No, no. You should separate them first. Okay. Yeah. So that's fine. Yes. So the type of things I presented can lead to separation. Sure. It's only a very small step to add. Yes. It's not a very important feature for launch. Yeah. Although it might be if you want to extract these features, like pitch and write off speech or energy simply from each person, you might have to do some basic separation. Because quite often people don't realize that they took at the same time, interred each other. Yes. So even if you don't want to recognize a speech fully, at least... You need to separate. You need. Yeah. And another... What's... what's the message? And... I don't remember. It's okay. You can email it. Okay. Yes. Also to extract the context. Yeah. Because if you know the words that are spoken, you can... let's say someone says... He's angry about this semantic context. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Then... My... that might onto the... Further directions. It's not in my project, but... No, but I think once you have to voice for a person, you can... Yes. Start to do this and the ones are people of speech recognition now. Professor didn't know why he's interested to know when people were talking about him. Yeah. Yeah. So it's... Someone is talking about me. Let's listen. Yeah. You could detect one word. Yes. Key words, putting... I have a special event, trigger, I thought. And lighting a light on his surface. So... Okay. So... you don't know with what you wanted to present it as... Yeah....with these questions? Yeah. I'll just say... If you want, I can point to... Three papers. Sure. But... no, I think it's better if I just send you... The link. The link. Sure. It's probably simpler. There are three papers about... One is about this sector based stuff. The localization and detection. Okay. One is about how to take the decision that somebody is active or not. It sounds simple at first. You think you just put the threshold and that's it. But the problem is... It's no problem. No, you can do that. No problem. No problem, but if you want your system to work in different conditions, like a cafeteria library, the environment will be quite different. So a single fixed threshold value might be a problem. In fact, for now we are using a kind of calibration, but... Yeah. It's still known. So you can do that automatically, these kind of things. I don't know if you're doing that already, but... Yes, but in fact you have to see it in front of the microphone. And let's say people want to speak and people too and people should be... Okay. Just subtracting the level that you kept in other microphones. So I have another paper which might be interesting for that... For a single channel, curly version. And I have code online. Okay. So for this particular one... The last one I would say is the clustering. To... Yeah, the clustering of the different locations over time. So that you can get small clusters of speech. There are other ways to do it, but I think it's important to... It's important because in spontaneous speech, always words are quite small. So you need to do that adequately. Yeah. But otherwise you aren't done. Okay. Just a last question when you mentioned it. If I'm speaking very... And you say it's... Yes, I'm just speaking one word every one second. Yes. So... Is the event that is detected will be some of small parts. Yeah. Yeah. There won't be many small events. Okay. Yeah. So yes, you have to repress to say... Yes. There is a very small interval. You have to consider it. Yeah. Basically... I mean, it depends. Because this is... Yes, this is one... This can be considered as one intervention. Yeah, even if somebody says just yes. I don't know if it's important for you or not. It might be. It might be. It might. This is not a very easy problem. For the first application we will do with prototypes. It will be more about quantity of speech or how long or much someone speaks. Yeah. But when we will go to finer details... If I'm talking on someone say yes, yes, yes from time to time, it's sure that it's participating. Yeah. And obviously it makes different that if someone is talking on... When it's replying never. And they're all moving. Yeah. No having the eyes open. Yes. So I'll send you links. Some of the papers are long, but you can just briefly look at them. Okay. We can go and see your TV unless you want to talk about something else. No, I think that's this work. I think we already have plenty to eat. Does it work? If I put in my email. Well, we can try. Try. No, it's not a... I guess you would have to install it. We have OCR, but maybe not on this computer. No, no, you see, I thought you can put in here your mail address and just do this and it mails me. No. That's a good idea. It's a good idea. Yeah, I see. I want too much. The application you are using, all of them, every time you are using MATLAB or programming. Yeah. Everything is based on MATLAB. Yeah, once I coded the most expensive part in C just to C, so you can have a mix of both. From MATLAB you call C and back insurance. I love that. And you can't be so upset. Okay. But the day you want to do online real-time stuff. You can't use MATLAB. No, I wouldn't. I wouldn't trust it. Mm-hmm. Okay. You have to code it. And you can do the MATLAB. My sheet is very filled up. I will take yours. I'm writing so anemicanrene. That's a kind of secret language. Okay. That was on you back here. Did you go on a regular? I'll go in here. Should we serve us? Okay. I'll go in here. Stop. Good others, tell them. Okay. Okay. Okay.
