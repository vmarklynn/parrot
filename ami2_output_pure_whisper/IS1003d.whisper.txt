 I'm sorry, not really. Thanks for being here. Your judgment is biased. I need to do my control and stay for her time. So, let's go for our detailed design meeting. So, I will still play the role of the secretary and we'll have first the presentation by our user interface designer, David Jordan, and our industrial designer, Baba. So, we'll have to evaluate your proposed remote control and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost. In case if we all agree on the fabric of building a C3 remote control, we'll evaluate the production. So, maybe I will let our two designers talk about some... I have slides. You have slides. This is our product prototype. This is made by Klin. It looks strange. The basic color is yellow and red. Yellow is our company color. I read it. It's more attractive. So, we use two basic colors. At the ship, there's two basic ships. The first is the cycle. And the second is the triangle space. We call it mushroom design. It looks like the mushroom design. This is the introduction of our product. Genetically modified mushroom, I will say. Okay. Yeah, the next slide. So, there are several key features of our prototype. The first is that it is fancy. I'm sure this would be the unique design in the market. Maybe I hope so. Yeah, so it's a fancy design and a unique design. The second key feature is that the circle channel selection. In the traditional controller, you use button to select the channel. But now we have a suck circle. So, we can turn this ball to select channel. It's quite convenient for users to use it. Yeah, but don't touch. Don't destroy your first time. Okay. The third feature is the stable triangle base. This triangle base is very stable. So, it's unlikely you cannot find it. So, you can put it in the table. So, you can turn the ball to select the channel. And there's some cute button. You can see the shape of the button is a mushroom. Everything's mushroom. So, we can call our remote control that mushroom. It was not really mushroom because you have lemon shape. Yeah, that's why if you put it in the table, careful somebody will eat it. I hope nobody will eat it anyway. You're trying to get the food aspect. Mushroom was not in the trance. For its vegetables. It's vegetable. It's vegetable. It's something eatable. We integrated the different color. But this is not a mushroom anyway. So, it's fine. I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable biasing. These colors. And spider color. And very sophisticated material. So, next slide. So, what I can add is that he talks about what is outside. So, what is inside is what we talked about. The chip is a low level chip. So, we cut it. The low level chips inside. And the LCD button. So, where's the battery? The battery is under the base. In the base. And where is the solar set? This is a kind of new revolutionary receptor that we can put outside. Do you think it won't be, it won't Christ increase the price? I don't think so. Okay, we'll see after. We'll have the first. Okay. So, Mr. Monet, what's your opinion, according to this remote control? I mean, we're going to try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about. We had three key points for this remote control design. And first one was fancy look and feel. Yeah. So, we tried to judge this feature with a one to seven scale. One being no. I think. Just let me check. So, 4.3.5, it means it's acceptable. One being true and seven being false. Okay. Oops. So, do we have a fancy look and feel? I think you have nice colors. The shape, the ball shape. Yeah, the shape is unique. The colors. I agree, it's unique, but is it really? So, is it really fancy? Do we define fancy? Yeah, I mean, fancy was defined by fruit and vegetable look. You have the lemon aspect of this. This is it. Yeah. Maybe if you change, if you take the buttons out. Maybe do you think like that? I don't know where the lemon is, but I mean, it's not obvious. This shape is the lemon line. It would be more like a lemon. If. Maybe improving the texture, like having less. Less buttons. Oh. So, my mush. Looks like more fruit. Maybe a pineapple. Yeah, I don't know. And you know, you have the finger here with the buttons? Yeah, it's a good idea. It looks more like a pineapple. Sorry. What's the use for that? I don't know. If you want to tame the ball, I have no idea. It's very convenient for you to tame the ball, to change the channel. Okay. It's embedded. Yeah, that's the second point. The second point is we have to judge the. If it is fancy or not. Fancy looking feel. Is it better like that? Okay, let's say it's a pineapple now. The color is the color acceptable. No, the color is okay. That's fine. So, the shame. It's like. I'd say there is more too much red. Not too much red. In the basement. It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top. Okay. Right. So, from one to seven. I'll give. Seven is the maximum? No, seven is false. And one is true. I'll give two or three. Three, I will say three. Three is fine for me. Okay. Three. Is it better like that? Yeah. Then, let me. What are the other criterias? Is it easier to use technically, technologically innovative? You said previously that there is some microphone inside. Yeah, this is microphone ring. It's a microphone. Okay. And you have the microphone ring. There's the technology inside that recognizes simple vocal comments. And you can turn it so maybe it's techno. Yeah. So, you can. I have a lot of things around remote control. Yeah, but when you say technology, it's more in the core of the single. We have tactile buttons. Mm-hmm. I said you have microphone ring, but you have... No, that's good. Yeah. That's good. And you have this solar receptor. Yeah. That's another really good point. Yeah. I think that's not going to do it acceptable. Maybe two. So using the same scale? Two? Two, yeah. Two. You agree? Yeah. Okay. Now, maybe the most critical one. Okay. Last one I would like to judge is... Is it easy to use? The local common, yes. It might be easy. Yeah, but it's stunning. Can you just explain me the... Can you just explain me the... It's a print saying. Yeah. Please. This is the base. Yeah. So you can tend to change the channel. Yeah, but how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels? I think maybe if you... Like if you want to go from... Oh, I understand. If you take... Take from the remote. So... And you can turn like that to change the channel to... Yeah, but imagine... I think it's quite easy to do zapping, but maybe it will be too fast. Yeah, I'm not definitely convinced. It's the best way to... If you want to jump from, I don't know, 1 to 20. Yeah, that's different. How can you go directly to 20, for example? No, no. It depends on the angle. Yeah. I agree. I agree. But I mean... You need to know... Is it the channel wide? So it could be channel... I think something that's three, channel four, channel five. Yeah, you have a click click click click click click click. Just imagine you have 50 channels. Oh, yeah. 50 channels you buy the number by 330 degree. Yeah. So you got how many degree you... Yeah, but you have to go through all the channels. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. When you stop... When you stop the... The tone... Mm-hmm. Then the angle you stop, it's angle you, it's the channel you... How do you know this angle is the correct one? It's very easy because you know how many channels are there... So you count at one degree, two degrees, no? Yeah, yeah, you can do it. I don't think so. Yeah, that's great. That's great. I think so, you can... Yes. I think... But the vocal common is easy to... You can say 50. Yeah, vocal common is okay. 50, it's okay. So we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be... Yeah, but when you're zapping, you're changing from one channel to the other, so you're passing through all the channels. So when you say I want to go to the channel number 20, that's you've decided to go to channel 20, so you can say channel 20. All right, yeah. Or channel 4, because you really want to go on this channel, but if you really want to... And this would be more for browsing. To do zapping, you don't really know what you want to do, you can turn it. Yeah. Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting. Mm-hmm. Seems to be good. Good choice, Mr. David Jordan. Yeah, I mean, you're famous. And whatever you do. Yeah, what's this? What's this? Cherry? Oh, you can... Also, the turner. Turner for the tune. Turner for the tune. If you want to skip from channel 1 to channel 2, you skip this. If you want to skip from channel 1 to channel 10, you turn this. It's like fine from cost to fine. This is cost. This is fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's cost to fine. It's great technology. Yeah, this looks better. Yeah, you see, this is from one channel to... I didn't see where it is. It's the turner. Turner for the tuneer. Turner for the tuneer. Actually, it's one of the... Yeah, you have the vocal comment. Uh, it's... On off. On off, yeah. Yeah, but it has to be on to... Most of the time you have them. Yeah, it's sleeping remote control. Yeah, sleeping. That's not the ecological... That's true. That's why we have the solar... To come back to the end. Yeah. Okay. So, which number? Three. It is, it's very relative, but three, it's fine, I think. It's rather than a... Do you agree? Yeah, I agree. So, the reason about this is four is one. Three. Three for me. It's... It's okay. It's... So... Four. Three. Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and just take the... Or what's your opinion? Uh, we can even say, I mean... Those are sort of agree, but this one would be more five to me. Five? I would like... I mean, this is just a prototype. I'm not really convinced it's so easy to use. Yeah, so... I don't know. What do you... What... You compare with traditional... Yeah. To... Traditional controller. I think it's easier than traditional controller. If you use traditional controller, you have to put the button. And now you don't have to put the button. You have... You just tend the... Yeah, but you know... That's who kind of... The smaller... Yeah. So you can control the scale. But in the traditional controller, how do... How can you control the scale? By pushing zero... You just put two buttons. Zero. That's the first one. And one. Yeah, yeah, you can do it. Yeah. But you can also do it in the... But if you do not want to browsing all the channels, you can just... There's also a button here. And there's some buttons, okay. Yeah. This function is just for your broadened. From one channel to the next one. The next... That's not what you say previously. Yeah, if you're changing your mind... This was the fine... Fine to course. Fine. Of course. And from 10 to 10 channels. Why do 10, 10 to 12... 10 to 20? And this one, one, two, three, four, five, six. Like this. Okay. So there's different scale. So you can... Okay. You can choose. But this... This has to stay on the table, right? Mm-hmm. This has to stay on the table. Alright. You can fuck on a flat. This is just a bit. You can just... You can... Yeah. But then when you turn it... Oh, yeah. Just right? No, no. You can't put it out. That's just your turn in from the base. You need to have everything in hand. If you want to turn, you can't use it and turn. You need to put it on and turn. You know, that's the weak point because with the traditional one, you just have one hand. Yeah, but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen. Say, I've lost the remote control. Nobody would take it. Yeah, you would never lose it on the... So this is the next generation. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe. It's the next prototype. Maybe we can change from... Maybe for it's okay. For... Easy to use for. You can save it. Yeah, for it's more. It's even easier to... Maybe. You can... You can error this. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, for it's more than I would say. So average... Nine over three? Three? Three. Three. It's average, it's more than I. Okay. So... It need maybe some further work, but... Yeah, especially on the easy to use. Yeah. Absolutely. Target. So the project is accepted. Yeah. Yeah. I think... I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you really want to have a fruitful, remote country. Okay. So... Is that fine? Okay. We had a prototype presentation with the evaluation. So as we all agree to accept... Yeah. Under certain conditions, the prototype will have looked to the financial view. So we need to calculate the projection cost. As I said in the first meeting, when to have remote control, that would cost more than 12 and more than 50 euros. And if not, if it's not the case, you would have to redesign it. Yeah. So just have a look at the... Okay. Here is the... Excel... Shit. So... So as the energy source, we have Hundinamo. No. We don't use that. We have battery, right? Yeah. Not battery. Kinetic. We don't have it, I suppose. But we have solar cells. Yeah. How many do you need solar cells? Do you think one would be enough for them? Such as... I think it's about... You have three. Three. Three. Three batteries, three solar cells. So... Electronic. Single, simple chip on print. Just one would be necessary. Simple, yeah. One. Zero for the others. And sample sensors and pull speaker. One. One. One. As we have voice recognition, I think. Yeah. Yeah. So the case... It would be... So we are all already 19. Wooden. Yeah. Okay. Just... Keep on going. Just have an idea. Yes, yes. Wooden... There's no good plastic just on anything. Yeah, but what about case? Uncurved, flat, single curved, double curved. I think it's more like double curved. That's a little bit of a double curved. Yeah, double curved. Yeah, double curved. One. One, yeah. One, yeah. Uh, wood? But it's... A rubber... Do you want it's special color? You may be too. Yeah, yeah. Two special colors. Yeah, yeah. Push button. Yeah, we have four. Five. Five. Okay. Okay. Okay. Scroll wheel? No. It's more like integrated. I think this will be like a scroll wheel. Yeah, you turn it. Sorry. Yeah. Maybe two scroll wheel eyes. Yeah, true. Yeah. We have the course to find a scroll wheel. Okay. So, no button supplements? No. Okay. No. No. Okay. I think we have problem. As you display maybe. Interphase. I think with... If we keep on adding things. It's okay. That's fine. So, we have to... Yeah. One of the key points is solar cells. Maybe if... If suppose if we change and we put just one. Yeah. Has it changed? Yeah, it was actually... It did change, but... Okay. We have to switch to electronics. From the samples of the cell to regular tip. Oh. We have to delete the samples. Yeah, but we have the voice recognition. No. Yeah, but this one, one of the features we were not able to... Yeah, it's the one... Maybe we have tumor and the first part in the basic version. I think you can transform the wood into plastic maybe. It seems that this can be... Oh, it would be better. Yeah, wood into plastic. It should be fine. Plastic is free. Yeah. So, do we need special color? Yeah, that's one of... Because we have red. Red and yellow. Red and yellow. We can turn everything in either yellow or black. Black then is a regular color. I think so. If we try to have a kind of... Yeah. Pineapple B. Okay. So, push button then it's the next... Yeah. And we have integrated scroll wheel with push button. But now I think this is one. Integrated scroll wheel push button. So, we have only one. And... Push button. Close to. So, if we have all integrated in the scroll wheel and push button. It's... Okay, remove maybe... You have five push buttons so we can just... Try to modify some of them. Okay, so what's the... Like... How about we change our color? Double curve. We can transform the double curve into single... Something flat. Yeah, but flat. Uncurved. Okay. Yeah, maybe not. Single curve better. Yeah. Single curve should be fine. Ooh, quick. Oh, we have only one. Really? One you were left. Um... Maybe don't... No battery on me, so myself. I think somebody gets... I think there's a problem with the push button. We only need... Just one. One push. Just one. Yeah. That's fine. Okay. So, actually... So, we have one button. Yeah, we have... So, one button and... One scroll wheel. Scroll wheel with push button on it. And the vocal cover, it's fine. It's fine. So... It's good they're not charging anything for them. So, yeah. I think we've done a good job as the cost is... Could we have looked at... Could we have looked at... Yeah, yeah. Actually, it's wrong. We're not under... The cost? Yeah, but it's under our equal. It's not rated. Sometimes it's under our equal. It's under our equal. It's fine. Okay. Okay. So, let's see... Twelve. Twelve. Fifty. Yeah. It's fine, right? Which part is the most defensive part? Solar cells. Solar cells, right? Yeah. Is it? Is it? I think... Yeah. But it would be interesting for our marketing team to make lots of advertisements... Yeah, to be able to sell to the same....and concerning these solar cells to be... That's a nice argument. Yeah. It's still for our... It's really, really, really, really, very expensive. Yeah. Maybe... Yeah, but it would be technologically innovative. Yeah, but we just have one button. So, it's easy to use in Powerful, as the remote controller has only one button? Easy, you know, about Powerful. Yeah. Easy Power. Easy to use. So, I don't think we need to redesign the product. Yeah. Yeah. Or that's what we've just done. We've done it. Yeah. It's under the... If it was low, high and so... So... Okay. Now... So, what are we going to do with this project evaluation? So... I think we have to just have to discuss it. Okay. Okay. So, did you enjoy your clay modeling? Yes. Of course. This is my job. Yeah. Was it a nice way to create your remote control? Yeah. It's a... It's good to create a control instead of a computer. Yeah. I think I found it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process from the beginning to the end and designing, looking at the chips, solar cells, and... It is very informative for me. And for the marketing guy? That was good, but we should have more brainstorming like meetings maybe. Because we're just presenting, one is presenting his stuff, next one his stuff, and then we try to combine afterwards. Okay. Okay. And new ideas about new products maybe, which would be fashion and yellow. Yellow. I think you can think about yellow TV now after a food TV or I don't know. It can be interesting. Yes, just lemon. Yeah, just lemon TV. You know the traditional TV is flat. Yeah, it's flat. It's square. Yeah, the chip is very boring. It's really boring. It's really boring. Come up with new TV. Yeah. With such as this kind of TV. So you can... You can have this, triangle base, so you have the TV. The lemon TV with the pineapple remot control. Yeah, that's... Yeah. That is really interesting. Yeah. Because the TV... Oh, that's interesting. We could do a kind of fruit collection of... Oh, you like this....electronic device. Yeah. Yes. You just don't trust too much the trends. Maybe. Because fruit and vegetables last for 10 years. Yeah, maybe the message will be insects. Yeah. But I think it's good to follow the flow and make it now and after, you know, if the people have changed their mind, you changed their mind. Yeah, but this is good because it's not a long life product. Yeah. TV is more like 15 years maybe so. Yeah, that's a lemon TV for... Yeah. We can think about TV with, you know, where you can change, you know, the aspect. So, like for the cell phones. Yeah. You customize it every time. So every time you go to a channel, you just change the appearance. Oh, so, yeah. You can do it all the time. You can make it. Yeah. And keep the number up here. Yeah, and following... The mood of person, the fashion. Yeah. It's interesting. Maybe we can create a line of TV. Yeah. TV. Yeah. But TV for autumn and a TV for winter, you know. So, that's... So, what is it? Okay. So, I think the costs are within the project. We're just... Yeah, that's actually... 12.50 euros. So... Do you think you can celebrate your own? Yeah. You can celebrate your creation. Yeah, you can celebrate your leadership. Oh, thanks a lot. Thank you. Well, I say yes. David Jordan. It's really a celebrating object. So, it's, you know, very... Yeah. It's very happy. Yeah. It's a party. It's a very much control. Yeah. The thing now is to... to sell it. Yeah, it's your job. Yeah. You sell it. You sell it. Good luck. Yeah. Okay, and the... 12.50... 12.25 euros. 25 euros. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's... 25 euros. 25 euros. Yeah, I think it's... 25 euros. So, maybe a little bit expensive. Maybe a little bit expensive. No, I'm... It's not so easy. I'm not so happy about the fruit chip, you know. What, really? It should be fine, you know, actually. Okay. Okay. Okay. Maybe you eat it. Maybe you eat it. Maybe you eat it. Maybe you can do a test, put it outside and you become... I mean, you become... I eat... really fruit. I think... But don't put sugar in it. The color I'm making is... The color I'm making. So, actually... No, the colors are... It's perfect, yeah. It's perfect. And two. Yeah, another thing is the logo is missing still. Yeah, but the color, I think the color is more... The yellow, more... The yellow, more... I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for remote control. Still, that was one of the requirements we had. Yeah, but I don't think it's such a problem. Just putting the logo somewhere. We can put some... Yeah, we decided to have something yellow and red for the costs. Yeah. So, maybe we can just integrate it on one side. The double R. Okay, yeah. That's a really good idea, so... So, we have logo, we have the color, and we have the fashion in electronics. So, we have the slogan too? So, we have give him... Give him... Give him... A cute name. A cute man. Yes, mushroom control. No, it's the pineapple control. You cannot say mushroom because it's not the same. It's the pineapple now. It's changed. It's pineapple. Pine apple. Pine apple. Pine apple. Yeah, just flying saucer. Let's carry him top. Okay. Oh, that's a flying saucer. And he didn't fire him once in one. Okay. Okay. That's pineapple remote control. I think it's fine. Would you buy one? Yeah, I'd try to. I tried to. 25. That's beautiful. I can't... I would try to work and see how easy it is. Yeah, you taught me you lost your control. Yeah, I already saw that. So... To need buy buy. So, if it is a universal, I can use it to my TV. Okay. One thing I like is the shape because, you know, it's not like the... The remote controls you can put in your pockets, in your jacket. This is why, this is why. What do you choose? I prefer the laser remote control. What do you choose? I think I will choose this one because of the color. It's okay. It's you light your house and your home and your TV. Okay. Oh, maybe next if we decide to do something, we can put light inside. Yeah. That would be a nice one. That's gonna be expensive, you know. We have some problems. I think... Going to have euros and... It would be interesting to just to see if we can... If people will buy this one and maybe add some features to it. Yeah. Yeah. If it's a new trend. Okay. So... That's fine. So, we can celebrate now. It's our new product. Champagne, see you later. Mr. Baba. It's fine. I like it. So bye-bye. Next time. We're eight by one. Yeah. So... That's fine. Okay. I will close this. Yeah. Go. So, I think we have... Finished. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I will close this. Yeah. Go. So, I think we have... Finished. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, I think we have... Finished. Okay. The designing and the evaluation of our remote control. Okay. Yeah. And we have a nearly final product. Oh, final prototype. Final prototype, right? Yeah. Yeah. So... Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. Okay. Very predictive. Okay. Thanks. Okay. So what is that storage in the remote? Mm. Yeah. A memory upgrade is closing so that the grid is in there. So, that should consume. Okay. Okay. Mm.
