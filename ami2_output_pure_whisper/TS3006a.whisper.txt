 Unless you visit me or something and then grab a little challenge exercising, ah? So you found your spots? Yes. Bling, bling. Okay. Where's my screen gone? Oh, yeah. You have to talk in English. Yeah. My screen is gone. It's called black. I'm afraid I'm a bit slow for this stuff. I'm afraid I'm a bit too slow. I don't know how much preparation you guys did, but not a lot. You see this beautiful presentation? Yeah. Very nice. Let's get started. I sort of prepared this. Opening acquaintance tool training. Project plan discussion. We're supposed to develop a new remote control that's both original, trendy and user friendly. Hope you have good ideas. We're working from top to bottom. Functional design. We do some individual work. We have a meeting to discuss the results, etc. At the end of the day, we should have a prototype to run up. We have a table, the smart board, and the white board. We should take some practice. We have some instructions on how to do that. You know how to document work. This is for toolbar. We have a pen. We can use the pen to perform. It doesn't always work. You can draw. In the format menu, you can select color and line with. Each of you can take some practice and draw an animal. You should explain with different colors and with different pen widths. Why you draw that particular animal. Don't take up too much space. You can use different colors. Should it be one? 4 letters. It needs some yellow. You can use one blank sheet for drawing. You can press the next button. You can do one. You can use one blank sheet for drawing. It's a great animal. It's more like a dinosaur. I will give it an eye. I will leave to eat. I will leave to eat. I will leave to eat. Your line broke. I see. I'm guessing a turtle. Why a turtle? You were slow too. I have a turtle pet. Does it have lags? It's more like a tank. It's a little like mole. Some spots. It's a friendly turtle. It's a little tail. Does it have ears? It's a little hole. I like it. I like the next. I like the next one. I like the next one. I like the next one. I like the next one. We have a financial aspect to this project. The production cost should be half of the selling price. We should get started. We have a specific task. The user interface shoots the technical functions. We have three design steps. We have two ideas. We have two points. We have two points. We have two points. We have two points. We have two points.
