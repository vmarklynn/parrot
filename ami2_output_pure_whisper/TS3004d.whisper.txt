 you should please want to sit down and show you it's not safe yet okay so okay Oh beautiful drawing so this is our agenda you you're going to show your prototype presentation after me oh yeah so these are the oh okay yeah so these are the last notes we are made if anything doesn't look right to say to me then I don't have to put it in the report you know we're doing the speech recognition because didn't have enough time to design the inside as well okay but still possible financially so if you want to okay yeah what none then we're gonna put it in okay just yeah just so we have to design the inside and but yeah or are we making a slide open like underneath or full open slide open is quite usual for remote control yes like underneath you can slide it open you can maybe that's stronger as well yeah yeah that's it's okay it's better when you have a lot of room inside so you can make it very easy to use because you can write a lot of comments size okay so this is okay I'll go to you know we're gonna use an advanced chips then okay so that's how much that is but okay for this yeah I think so I don't know now you have a different chip for speech recognition okay so I really calculated that and still in the budget so you can show your prototype if you want this yeah together yeah let's do it together okay yeah we just made a word file with the basic elements the look and feel model well the form the case as drawn there simply a square with round corners so that's basically it the material should be hard plastic color changeable and also transparent and color and transparent or just transparent I don't know then the elements we have the functions are just basic like I've pointed a mirror mute function on off function text functions this switch channel okay cool and this is the the numpad and the logos over here in the mic okay and the scroll will know you operate that with your pointing finger so you hold it like this in your right hand and so how many things do you need for for the microphone speech recognition yes speech recognition there's only one button to say specification of that but I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something yeah maybe maybe you have to configure it yes you need options to finger it and often that you don't need them anymore so you can put it on the back as well if you know you can all are on the slides function I don't know okay well we haven't had time to design that the slides we also don't know how many buttons are required or what kind of buttons but you have a lot of room if you can slide it open yeah I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something so the position yeah you write to you wrote this name the main zap buttons are more central this was the most important thing so best replace best reach place on off buttons text buttons mute buttons are together and that's a place they usually are easy to find the on off button is bit bigger so it stands out that way you don't have to make it right because it will show up score wheels on the left side it's basically the best standard place for school yeah but it's not impossible to use it if you're left-handed so yeah because you can use your thumb then just just one thing now you need to have more one tooth you've got one two three four five six seven eight nine yeah but you missed the no the zero yeah two is try that's the other that then if I'm just so you get that okay it's rather important yeah okay this we just missed that but well just I'll get back to later the foreign well you have taken that from the iPod other proper technical device so should be popular with the buttons creating if you that are all round shapes not around these corners okay so that now you get a bit round feeling no use hard plastic since that allows us to use 2D buttons non-robor buttons color changeable more and the backlight thing the thing that lights up we have decided in the the channel buttons there's a little color around it okay and also in the numpad there was also color of light behind it and so we still can do you still can choose what color you want yeah how do you want to implement that just to the maybe on the second level as well yeah these are just basic functions so all the non-basic okay just roll the second level because we need that okay there's one function I use daily and it's not on the basic functions it's to switch to your scarred PlayStation or DVD player okay maybe we use this button yeah maybe or you can lay it beneath and the other yeah as well you should make video device like maybe just just draw second level one and say all options that are still left or something a second level like new no just just here and there okay how does the second level come out it slides I think yeah from from the you can do it as it claps open but I think that's not solid no that's right yeah that's right so it doesn't even have to slide all the way up so what do we need the speeds functions buttons yeah just menu menu button with maybe arrows so you can roll in the navigate the menu scarred well I think we can even put we have one for the zero and one for the one more digit so you can also you have one of the other one so this is the video which I know PlayStation etc that's used pretty often yeah like you have PlayStation you used every day basic external or something you want to save that files well drawing so here are multiple speech buttons I don't know how many doesn't really matter what else what else menu buttons what yeah like a normal like a normal like this yeah within the middle of a menu button yes okay well you don't have any anything on how many buttons speech you cry so you can't really design that okay maybe one button to switch the color of your let's yeah yeah and you can hold it you can hold it and then the color switch yeah multiple switch first again the color switch again maybe okay oh we just make it three buttons all the colors on it red okay enough place and then we can do that we can put as here color buttons and then we choose green blue and red yeah okay okay that's so did we miss anything yeah maybe some some text some text that's more will that it is volume okay yeah but there's one there's one text I hear yeah yeah okay there's more that's the one that you use if you search for a page like 700 and it's counting from 100 to 200 you will switch to your television and back yeah do you do you think of that yeah but then you can switch back to normal tell it tell text you just switch it off and then just put it on a sec well we thought of text button and if you press it again you get the state the state the three stages yeah but but if you are in a second stage the third stage is switch tell text off so you can switch back from second to turn off just don't just remember where it was it doesn't clear the page if you turn tell text on you set 700 and you turn it off then the next time you turn it on it still stays okay okay yeah but it's maybe it's not the way that's a functionality for the television yeah I think as well but that's maybe one yeah no the remote can send like the code for 700 page 700 to the television yeah if you switch it on control in the yeah but just search every time again that's what what happening if you do it like that yeah that's true television it's good so yeah do we need to fix that or no that's what those new TVs do collect all the pages yeah those memories I'm not not every every television so yeah this logo for volume yeah so that's it this is pretty much it yeah yeah I thought about one thing debatons from material already now just like your telephone yeah just hard plus okay because if you use it a couple of years some sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are a slide away and maybe we can describe the numbers below or above or shall we just turn it on the buttons I think just if you do it above above or below it takes that's too much place yeah I think you have a problem more often with rubber buttons rubber buttons yeah okay fine yeah okay yeah I don't know what this means but I think we just evaluated this one yeah I made some criteria okay you made some good okay evaluate our model okay I did it don't think if it's right did I shall show it you're some usability criteria okay I know all criteria as we just argue about in the bottom look at feel evaluation is yeah information presentation it's not here it doesn't matter it only had two pages or something well I looked in the reports from the marketing strategy or of the new needs and the market the Italians how they think about it and the research about the the the users and that kind of stuff and I made some criteria and we have to test the criteria from one to zero we should we can give it a number and then we can give ourselves an average for our okay model and this these are all I found or I wrote down and we have to discuss about if we give it the one or a seven I think if you have a kind of eyeball idea why beautiful yes we are the difference between a beautiful and fancy look and feel is the the outside beautiful like the iPod or something and fences more like the the flashing lights and the colors and that kind of stuff okay yeah I think we do if it's really you can if you can get the iPad look then it's beautiful yes what kind of what kind of basic colors the basic colors are black or green or yellow yeah how do we make maybe company colors just black black and yellow yellow light no not really but just a bit of yellow black white maybe like white also like and what cars should the buttons be because different colors this is just the same as the the cover but also the light can you change those to with switch no make them no just make them black or gray or something great just dark gray okay okay so what number do we give a beautiful beautiful is really subjective because it has to do lots with the colors well we have changeable phones changeable phone so F4 F1 for everyone is something you just give it a one it's okay it's perfect I think it's just what you want right now it's hard to decide for us but yeah so it's a lot better than current remote controls okay okay the fancy look and feel that's about our flashing lights and the background lights from the buttons yeah okay and we can change the color so that's really fancy I think yeah one more thing are we changing or are they there are back lights on the slight panel too or no backlight slight panel yeah no no it's only on the number behind the numbers and the switch channel is I mean this here yeah but it's not necessary it's pretty cool if you slide it open it lights up that's that's really fancy but I don't know if it's reachable of course it's reachable then we do it just some light to light it all up you can see what's really there not just not really on the buttons or something just green light or from blue light but yeah yeah just backlight not not the buttons and and the normal backlights also not the buttons but behind the buttons so the buttons are just great yeah okay fine so I think it's very fancy yeah yeah I've done a lot of detail in light so yeah and you can also choose in light so yeah this is one it's okay I think it's one okay next this is a difficult one we don't know we don't know it about the I mean show tested but I it's very easy to use but the second layer is not easy to use that's no but you don't have to use that and you don't have to pay attention to that second layer that's that's the main thing that's so good about I think it's easy to use learnable learnable it's not not as fast as a usual remote control well I think it goes I think I think the scroll wheel is very handy but the first time you get this thing in your hands is not to use the scroll wheel I think you must seek for it and up or down but the rest of it is very easy because so so I think it's very clear so few information that you can easily decide what button is for what function second part like speech that's that will be hard to learn so it is learnable and in first place it's very easy to use and I think it's scroll wheels you use it as well if you have ever used a different kind of we've got to some two or three new things and maybe maybe learnable is in compare of old fashioned remote controls so we have speech the scroll wheel and the the slide you must slide it that's not normal at the normal remote controls I think learnable is less than easy to use because it's used comes after I think it's very cool so just give it to maybe three then learnable no but definitely better much better than than normal then one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know okay new features technological innovative the speech function and the speech function new will the scroll wheel and the slide I think the slide is not new no I only saw it in a telephone not in an oh I already have a VCR and it's from 1988 and the other slide and also why the buttons come out as well okay okay and the lightning that's cool yeah for lighting is the scroll wheel I think speech speech is new different colors so yeah different fronts for remote control I think that's new too yeah so we have a pretty new there are no games only that's not a one it's a two again it's not LCD and we also have the home station we are forgetting about that now but yeah oh yeah that's why I'm so rechargeable now we didn't draw that to one but that's more like yeah just draw it afterwards yeah that's just a normal simple thing if you can you save it on the same in the same map as the other ones in the the project map just say save us say that's not it's not that's not it well it's already in the folder like number seven oh yeah okay yeah smart words you have a this one this one is not yet in there I think it is yeah I think it is stealth is all the reason and your features so we give it a two or also again and one no I think you if you have games on it then then you get you're one we are not extraordinary new or something targeted audience we are the targeted audience do we like it we we search for a young group yeah but young enough 40 so we are exactly the targeted group yeah but did we reach with our style the targeted audience that's my question you get the fancy things for younger people yeah aesthetic things for older people we've got a one for fancy look and feel and that's what attracts the yeah young audience so yeah that's the only point is that we don't have that's already that's not that's this question yeah but it does basically not not handy and I don't think I don't see yeah this so targeted that we didn't follow the latest trends no yeah you could make a I think you could make a front a front that's like a like a night or something or my computer well food and vegetables you get different you get different front so we had like a fruit banana kind of front but Spongy will never be no so we give herself a free or something okay so that's 11 that's what's our first 11 divided by six yeah this 1.83 up perfect score we're not too hard on ourselves this is a power indicator okay you can see how far it's charged up and then you need to a button to call it to let it be to go oh yeah that's still yeah but we have to make a speaker then too if you want to make it be maybe I just skip that one it's no one that in but we can we can do it underneath the logo that's usable if you do it's really useful yeah the speaker is very small as well yeah okay it's so I just got a financial you say safety yeah I did save it no okay if I look at this one here the production cost of it if I forgot anything say to me just a battery there are some things that they didn't mention because recharge is not on the list but okay so I think we are pretty much in the right direction because it's 12.3 euros okay but it's a regular chip and and a sample speaker okay so that's both no that's perfect 12.3 yeah and single curve it but but is it does it include a home station or no that's not on the list but can we make that for 20 cents yeah we can probably I just the button supplements I was wondering if this special color maybe was different fronts but standard front one but yeah special form yeah but maybe we have to yeah it's okay special color you can skip this one because it's all quite normal yeah you get different ones at all so you can put a recharge here this is expensive the sample speaker yeah it's for it's four euros oh damn is that included yeah that's kind of weird that we then we need to use we get this information now afterwards because yeah yeah okay so this is pretty much hit this one damn solo sales so I was just I just want to yeah we just made it so we can do the project if you evaluation now for everything together okay we can do some discussion about this was there room for creativity sure yes okay but also room for creativity yeah yeah I think so I think everyone share the early so yeah if we got an eye mark for innovativeness or innovativity yeah we probably have things about it we could make a lot of different remote controls yeah it's creativity okay so the leadership was the real leadership of course the worst okay what do you have to say about that yeah just normal discussion I think not yeah yes one leader or something one leader to check the time yeah and make notes yeah I know so more like a secretary yeah okay next one team work the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard you were not oh we're not yeah agree with every now we had so much information that we get through email and just I think we got the wrong information at the wrong time I think that was the biggest problem yeah like the prices if you knew that before we could have yeah that's really really really quicker yeah because the prices could be 20 euro or something and if you had a good news then we would discourage yeah yeah finance so we're basically basically just lucky to get the price right but the team where it was okay yeah everybody could speak their opinion I think everyone listened to each other yeah like marketing said then we had to include them in the design yeah okay yeah what I have to say about means the smart board is okay did you pen is horrible if you use it but if you want to download it to your computer it doesn't work just doesn't work no digital pen smart board would be very nice to work with if it's worked really real yeah it would be faster drowning so more hard to make I think yeah it should be more accurate precise and I think it would be great if you could edit it from just with a mouse when it's hitting yeah not just pointing out the same for the presentation for the presentation you can do it from here that's my cheese and standing there yeah and see yeah I'm just point with a mouse no use to draw on the board itself it's just slows down yeah just old-fashioned kind of black board style but yeah they might as well do it in normal computer style even hard as you draw like this and it's far too slow this way yeah okay you could draw on it but not as main function no I guess I think yeah okay so we made it in time we did it the budget yeah new ideas found new ideas what's that four four four I don't know what I mean just think if you to gather or to work together or new ideas for remote control probably no for the project format though favorites for your text no for the prototype new ideas yeah but still you couldn't make a fancy you couldn't make a prototype out of this because we don't have any sizes and move but it's for the next team yeah what you can possibly do that in such a short time I think yeah just this is the ID face yeah just brainstorming basically details so are we finished yes I think just just write a final report okay quite early yeah no we have only four minutes left it's okay well do we have to do them we were done at four o'clock it's now quarter past three so I should take some pictures okay let's play my sweeper one two three four five six seven cameras so did we'll see it yeah now we can look at this this is we're probably not supposed to look at this yeah from the previous group they went for for you know but also different devices yeah then then else deep would be any here are the basic functions and here selecting the devices yeah I do agree English is not so hard by the way no I'm breaking a girls record here well later got a problem Paul you do yes you have to make a choice no enjoy choice whoa that's pretty quick just take one yeah to the side it's the low one what's this a bomber no open one is the bomb this the bomb yes for in a row no that's too much work come on said previous work yeah this one I challenge you that's so stupid not that doesn't work no you got to use the magic pen hmm what if I put one yeah that's stupid we'll see okay I don't agree hmm so you had two choices that's gonna be drawn or not hmm too bad I'll put it here yeah then we're going to put it there damn no one wins difficult choice either here or there this is a very interesting design I mean it's just the same as normal they done and it has a LCD yeah I think then do it correctly it's too good okay wait I'm going to draw something you must okay I'm going to guess what you're drawing okay blank no not a new one now I did just don't say I know how yeah you have to use the pen you have to save everything you know that thing not everything yeah everything pen select pen and once you know what we do in our spare time okay it's a house a plant no it's only you can know it only I can know it it's it's very hard to draw okay that makes it easier I think I know no wrong I think I know what you're trying to do but it's wrong already it's very you missed the right five a little bit maybe you where you're wrong now the entrance warning finish meeting now all right okay the entrance is more to the left warning warning you're correct okay that I think this part yeah I think I made another mistake oh yeah there are a lot of mistakes because the walls are thick like this no not that one but there's a big hole here as well oh here that's the kind of big mistake they're walking behind the walls warning finish meeting now guys I think we have to finish the meeting okay this is a hard one what does it say fill in the questionnaire what now come on okay okay no more chit chat over there yeah I'm gonna be so lonely clean it up later this is that's my native face look up this edited smiley oh you
