 you should please want to sit down and show you it's not safe yet okay so oh beautiful drawing this is our agenda you you're going to show your prototype presentation after Oh, I didn't. Oh, yeah. So these are the... Oh, okay. Yeah. So these are the last notes we made. If anything doesn't look right, just say it to me. I don't have to put it in the report. You know, we're doing the speech recognition because we didn't have enough time to design the inside as well. Okay, but still possible financially. So if you want to... Okay, yeah, well then we're going to put it in. Okay, just... Yeah, just... we have to design the inside then, but the... Yeah, or are we making a slide open like underneath or full open? I don't know. Slide open is quite useful for remote control. Yeah, so like underneath you can slide it open. You can... Maybe that's stronger as well. Yeah, it's... it's very important. Okay, I think that's better. Well, and you have a lot of room inside, so you can make it very easy to use. Because you can write a lot of comments besides it. Okay, so this is okay, I'll go to. Okay, so we're going to use advanced chips then. Okay, so that's... Just look how much that is. But... Okay, for the... Yeah, I think so. I don't know. No, you have a different chip for speech recognition. Okay. So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget, so it's okay. Good. So you can show your prototype if you want to. Yeah, together. Yeah, let's do it together. I'll give comments. Okay. We just made a word file with the basic elements. The look and feel model. Well, the form, the case, as drawn there, simply a square with round corners. So that's basically it. The material should be hard plastic. Color are changeable and also transparent. And color and transparent or just transparent, I don't know. Then the elements. So we have... The functions are just basic. Like I've pointed them here. Mute function, on off function, text functions. This is the switch channel. Okay, cool. And this is the numpad. And the logo is over here and the mic. Okay. And the scroll will now... You operate that with your pointing finger. So you hold it like this in your right hand. So how many things do you need for the microphone? Speech recognition. Yeah, speech recognition. There's only one button to say. I didn't have a specification of that, but I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something. Yeah, maybe you have to configure it. Yes, you need options to configure it. And after that you don't need them anymore. So you can put it on the back as well? Yeah, you can all... Or on the slides function, I don't know. Okay. Well, we haven't had time to design that. The slides... We also don't know how many buttons are required or what kind of buttons, but... You have a lot of room if you can slide it open. Yeah, you can put this. I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something. Yeah, enough room. The position. Yeah, you're right. You wrote this. The main Zab buttons are most central. This was the most important thing. So best replace, best reach place. The on-off buttons, text buttons, mute buttons, are together. And at the place they usually are. Easy to find. The on-off button is a bit bigger. So it stands out. That's why you don't have to make it right because it will show up. Score wheels on the left side. It's basically the standard place for score wheels. Yeah, but it's not impossible to use it if you're left handed. Yeah, because you can use your thumb then. Just one thing now. You need to have more. You've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. But you missed the zero and the two tries. That's all I had. I'm just sorry to get that. Okay, but it's rather important. Yeah, we just missed that. Well, just, I'll get back to later. The forum, well, you have taken that from the iPod, other appropriate technical device. So it should be popular. The buttons creating, if you, that are all round shapes, not around these corners. Okay, so now you got a bit round feeling. No use hard plastic since that allows us to use 2D buttons, non rubber buttons. Color changeable, more on the backlight thing, the thing that lights up. We have decided in the channel buttons, there's a little color around it. Okay. And also in the numpad, there's also color of light behind it. And do you still can choose what color you want? Yeah. How do you want to implement that? Maybe on the second level as well? Yeah, these are just basic functions. So all the non basic. Okay, just roll the second level because we need that as well. Okay, there's one function I use daily and it's not on the basic functions. It's to switch to your SCART, PlayStation or DVD player. Okay, maybe we use this button for that. Yeah, maybe or you can lay it beneath in the other area. Yeah, as well. Just make a video device. Just draw second level one and say all the options that are still left or something. A second level like new. No, just down there. How does the second level come out? It slides on the slides I think. Yeah, maybe from the, you can do it as it claps open, but I think that's not solid. No, you've got a slide. Yeah, that's right. So it doesn't even have to slide all the way up. So what do we need? To slide the speech functions buttons. Yeah, just menu. Menu button with maybe arrows. So you can roll in the navigate menu. Oh, SCART. SCART. I think we can even put, we have one for zero and one for the more digit. So you have one left. So this is the video channel, PlayStation, etc. that's used pretty often. Yeah, but you have to play a session. You use it every day. Basic. External or something. You want to save the files, Val? Draw in. So here are multiple speech buttons. I don't know how many. Doesn't really matter. It doesn't really matter. Okay. We don't have any. What else? What else menu buttons? What's the name? Yeah, it's an navigate. With arrows. I don't know what things best if we do. Where do I have? Like a normal. Like on the normal. Like this. Yeah, within the middle of a menu button. Yes. Okay. Well, you don't have any anything on how many buttons, speech, who cries. So it can't really design that. Okay. Maybe one button to switch the color of your lats. Yeah. Yep. And you can hold it. You can hold it. And then the color switch or multiple. Yeah. Just press again, the color switch again, maybe. Okay. Oh, we just make it three buttons. All the colors on it. Red. Okay. If we have enough place and then we can do that. We can put those here. Color buttons. And then we choose green, blue and red. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's. So did we miss anything? Yeah. Maybe some text. Some text. That's the whole wheel that it is. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. But I just heard the volume logo. There's one. There's one text. Oh, one. Yeah. Okay. There's now or it's written. I prefer that's the one that you use if you search for a page, like 700. And it's counting from 100 to 200. You will switch to your television and back. Yeah. Do you think of that? Yeah. But then you can switch back to normal teletext. You just switch it off and then. I just put it on the text. Well, we thought of text button. And if you press it again, you get the. The state. The state. The state. Yeah. But if you're in a second stage, the third stage is switched teletext off. So you can switch back from second to first. Just remember where it was. It doesn't clear the page. If you turn teletext on, you set 700 and you turn it off. Then the next time you turn it on, it still stays on. Okay. Okay. Maybe it's not the way. That's a functionality for the television. Yeah. I think as well. That's maybe one. Yeah. No, we can discuss. No. The remote can send like the code for 700, page 700 to the television. Yeah. If you switch it off. Yeah. But you have to search every time again. That's what's happening if you do it like that. Yeah. It's true. Yeah. It's still television. It's not good. So, yeah. Do we need to fix that or? No, that's what it is. You collect all the pages. Yeah, those memories. Not every television. This logo for volume. Yeah. That's fine. So, that's it. This is pretty much it. Yeah. I thought about one thing. The buttons from each material already. No, just like your telephone. Just hard plus. Okay. It's expensive to make it from a different material. If you use it a couple of years, sometimes the numbers on the buttons are a slight away. And maybe we can describe the numbers below or above or shall we just turn it on the buttons. I think just if you do it above or below, it takes... Yeah, that's too much place. I would just think just lays this for a few times. Yeah. I think you have a problem more often with rubber buttons. Yeah, with rubber buttons. Okay. Okay. Fine. Yep. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know what this means, but I think we just evaluated this one. Yeah, I made some criteria. Okay. You made some good. Okay. Okay. I did it. I don't think if it's right. Did I shall show it? I don't think I'm going to show it. Yes, I'm going to show it. Okay. You have some usability criteria. Uh-huh. Okay. Oh, no. All criteria as we just argue about. In the bottom. Look, I feel. Evaluation. Yeah, evaluation presentation. There is no thing. It doesn't matter. It only had two pages or something. Well I looked in the reports from the marketing strategy or of the new needs and the market, the Italians, how they think about it. The research about the users and that kind of stuff. I made some criteria and we have to test the criteria from 1 to 0. We can give it a number and then we can give ourselves an average for our model. These are all I found or I wrote down and we have to discuss about if we give it one or a seven. I think if you have a kind of eye-paught idea, why beautiful? Yes, the difference between a beautiful, fancy look and feel is the outside, beautiful like the eye-paught or something and fancy is more like the flashing lights and the colors. That kind of stuff. I think if you can get the eye-paught look, then it's beautiful. What kind of basic colors are black or green or yellow? How do we make company colors? Just black. Black and yellow. Yellow light. No, not really but it's possible. No, not yellow light but just a bit of yellow. Black white, maybe. Black white also light. What colors should the buttons be? Because... Different colors. Just the same as the cover. But also the light. Can you change those too? With the switch? No. Just make them black or gray or something. Just dark gray I think. Okay, so what number do we give a beautiful? Beautiful is really subjective because it has to do lots with the colors. We have changeable phones. Changeable phones for everyone is something beautiful. Yeah, just give it a one. It's okay, it's perfect. I think it's just what you want or not. It's hard to decide for us but... Yeah. It's a lot better than current remote controls. Okay, just give it a two. Okay. The fancy look and feel. That's about our flashing lights and the background lights from the buttons. Yeah. And we can change the colors so that's really fancy I think. One more thing. Are they back lights on the slide panel too or no back light? Slide panel? No. No, it's only on the number, behind the number. And the switch channel is... Or it's back light. I mean this here. Yeah, but it's not necessary. What do I think is necessary? It's pretty cool if you slide it open. It lights up. That's really fancy but I don't know if it's reachable. Of course it's reachable. It doesn't make... Then we do it. Okay, maybe just some light to light it all up. So you can see what's really there. Not just not on the buttons or something. Just green light or from blue light to light it all up. But yeah, just back light. Not the buttons. And the normal back lights also not the buttons but behind the buttons. So the buttons are just gray. So yeah, semi-transparent. Yeah, that's fine. Okay, fine. So I think it's very fancy. Yeah. So I've done a lot of detail in light. Yeah, and you can also choose in light. Yeah, this is one. It's okay. I think this one. Okay, next. This is a difficult one because we don't know. We don't know about the... Yeah, we should test it. It's very easy to use but the second layer is not easy to use. No, but you don't have to use that and you don't have to pay attention to that second layer. That's the main thing that's so good about it. I think it's easy to use and learn about this. Learnable. It's not as fast as a usual remote control. Well, I think it is. Because I think the scroll wheel is very handy. But the first time you get this thing in your hands is not to use the scroll wheel. I think you must seek for it and up or down or... But the rest of it is very easy because there's so... Yeah, I think it's very clear. So a few information that you can easily decide what buttons for what function. Okay. The second part is like speech. That will be hard to learn. So it is learnable. First place is very easy to use. I think it's scroll wheels is easy to use as well. If you have ever used a different kind of... We've got two or three new things. Maybe learnable is in a compare of old fashioned remote controls. So we have speech, the scroll wheel and the slide. And that's not normal at normal remote controls. I think learnable is less than easy to use because easy to use comes after learnable. Okay, easy to use is very cool. So just give it a two. Maybe a three then learnable. No, but it's definitely much better than... Than normal. Than one use showed is just all buttons and you don't know. Yeah, true. Than a two. Okay. New features. The speed function and the score. The speed function. The scroll wheel and the slide. I think the slide is not new. The slide is not new. No. I only saw it in a telephone. I already have VCR and it's from 1988 and the layer of the slide. Also why the buttons come out as well. Okay. And the lightning. Is that new? Yeah, for lightning. The scroll wheel. The new I think. Speech. Speech is new. Different colors. Yeah, different fronts for remote control. I think that's new too. Yeah. So we have a pretty new one. Yeah, no games on it. It's not a one. It's a two again. It's not LCD or something. We also have the home station. We are forgetting about that now. Oh yeah. That's very chargeable. Yeah, we didn't draw that too. But that's more like now. Yeah, just draw it afterwards. Yeah, just a normal simple thing. If you can you save it on the same map as the other ones. In the project map. Just save? Save us? Mm-hmm. Save us? No, that's not the other one. Well, it's already in the folder. Like number seven. Oh yeah, okay. Yeah. Smart words. This one is not yet in the... I think it is. It's not in the area. Click click. Yeah, it is. I think it is. I'm titled. Yeah, it doesn't matter. Okay. These delts are all the resources. They're all the same. And your features, so we give it a two or also again a one. No, I think if you have games on it, then you have one. We are not extraordinary new or something. No, that's so true. Two, I think. Targeted audience. We are the targeted audience. Do we like it? No, we search for a young group. Yeah, but we need 40. Young enough 40. Yes. We are exactly the targeted group. Yeah, but did we reach with our style, the targeted audience? That's my question. I think so, yeah. You get the fancy things for younger people and you get the aesthetic things for older people. We've got a one for fancy looking feel and that's what attracts the young audience. Yeah. I think that's the only point that we don't have. That's already, that's this question. Yeah, but that's basically not handy and I don't see. Yeah, so we targeted it. But we didn't follow the latest trends. No. Yeah, you could make a front. I think you've got the latest trends. A front. These are the only latest trends I have. That's on my computer. Well, fruit and vegetables. Yeah, you get different colors. You get different fronts. Yeah, so we have fruit. Banana kind of front. But Spongy will never be. No. So we give ourselves a three or something. Oh. Okay. So that's eleven. That's... What's that for? Eleven divided by six. Yeah, this is one point eight three. Up, perfect score. No, I don't know. We're not too hard on ourselves. We have a power indicator. Okay, you can see how far it's charged up. And then you need a button to call it, to let it be, to call. Oh, yeah, that's still there. Yeah, but we have to make a speaker then too, if you want to make it be. Maybe you have to skip that one. No, I don't want that in. But we can do it underneath the logo. That's usable. If you do it... It's really useful. Yeah, the speaker is very small as well. Yeah, okay. So I just got a financial... Is it safe to say that? Yeah. I did save it. No. Okay, so if I look at this one here, the production costs of it. If I forgot anything, say it to me, just the battery. Yeah, there are some things that they didn't mention because recharge is not on the list. But okay. So I think we are pretty much in the right direction because it's 12.3 euros. Okay. So this is a regular chip and a sample speaker. Okay. So that's both. No, that's perfect. 12.3. Yeah. And single curve it. But does it include a home station or...? No, that's not on the list. Can we make that for 20 cents? Yeah, we can. Probably. I just... The button supplements. I was wondering if this special color maybe was... Different fonts, but standard font. Yeah. It's special form. Yeah. It's hard to say. But maybe we have to... Yeah, it's okay. Special color, you can skip this one because it's all quite normal. Yeah. You get different ones at all. So you can put a recharge here as well. But this is expensive, the sample speaker. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's four euros. Oh, damn. Is that included? Yeah, that's included. It's kind of weird that we get this information now afterwards. Yeah, I know. Okay, so this is pretty much it this morning. Damn, solo sales. So I just want to... Yeah, we just made it so we can do the project if you're evaluation now for everything together. Okay. Okay. We can do some discussion about this. What's that room for creativity? Sure. Yes. Okay. But what's the room for creativity? Yeah, I think so. I think everyone shared their ideas. Yeah, if we got an eye mark for innovativeness or innovativity. Yeah. Oh, definitely. I think we probably have a lot of things about it. We could make a lot of different remote controls. Yeah. So it's creativity. Okay, so the leadership was the real leadership. Of course the worst. Okay. What do you have to say about that? Just a little bit. Just normal discussion, I think. Yeah. One leader or something? One leader to check the time. Yeah. And make notes. Yeah, I know. So more like a secretary. Okay, next one. Teamwork. The third meeting, I think that one was pretty hard. We were not, we were not, we were not, yeah, agree with that. We had so much information that we get through email and just. I think we got the wrong information at the wrong time. I think that was the biggest problem. Yeah. Like the prices. If you knew that before we could have. Yeah, that's the question really, really quicker. Yeah, because the prices could be 20 euro or something. And if we had 50 euros, then we would just screw it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Finance. So we're basically just locking to get the price, right? But the team work was okay. Yeah, everybody could speak their opinion. I think everyone listened to each other. Yeah. Like marketing said, then we had to include them in the design. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, what I have to say about means, the smart board is okay. Did you paint is horrible? I don't know if you use it, but if you want to download it to your computer, it doesn't work. Yeah, it just doesn't work. No. Digital pen. Smart board would be very nice to work with. If it's worked really well. Yeah, it would be faster. We're drowning for a more accurate... It's hard to make, I think. Yeah. It should be more accurate, precise. And I think it would be great if you could edit it from just with a mouse, from where it's hitting. Yeah. Not just pointing out. It's the same for the presentation you can do from here. That's my cheese, and it's standing there. Yeah. And see... Yeah, I'm just pointing with a mouse. No use to draw on the board itself. It just slows down. Yeah. Just old fashioned kind of blackboard style. Yeah. You might as well do it in normal computer style. Yeah, even harder to draw. Like a blackboard style. And it's far too slow this way. Yeah. Okay. You could draw on it, but not as main function. No. I just, I think. Yeah. Okay. Just a pen. So we made it in time. We made a remote control. We did it. In the budget, yeah. New ideas found. New ideas. What's that? Four, four, four. I don't know what you mean. I just think if you... To gather or to work together on new ideas for... For remote control, probably. No, for the project. For remote, though. The favorites for your text. No, for the prototype. New ideas. Yeah, but still you couldn't make a fancy... You couldn't make a prototype out of this because we don't have any sizes and... Well, but it's for the next team. Yeah. What did you do? You can possibly do that in such a short time, I think. Yeah, just the ID phase, though. Yeah. Just brainstorming, basically. Details. So, are we finished? Yes, I think just write a final report. Okay, quite early. Yeah. No, we have only four minutes left, so it's okay. Oh, okay. What do we have to do then? We were done at four o'clock. It's now quarter past three. Yeah. I should take some pictures. Okay. We can do it afterwards. Yes. Let's play minesweeper. Yeah, I found it as well. Tiddin' to... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven cameras. Not bad. I don't know why. Okay. Oh, it's very bad, but the yes is a little Pollock. It's aARuse. We'll see it. Yeah. Now we can look at this. This is? We're probably not supposed to look at this. The old versions. Yeah, from the previous group. They went for... Touch device. Yeah, but also different devices. Then the LCD would be handy. Here are the basic functions. Here are the selecting of devices. Yeah, the touch means for all that stuff. I do agree with that. Yeah, to do... English is not so hard, by the way. No. I'm breaking a girl's record here. Come on, leader. I'm just... I've got a problem, Paul. You do? Yes. You have to make a choice? No, I choose a choice. Whoa, that's pretty quick. Ta-da. Just take one. Yeah, to the side. It's the lower one. What's this? A bomber. No, no, no. The upper one is the bomb. This is the bomb. Yes. No. Shit. I knew it. I knew it. Four in a row. No, that's too much work. Come on. Is that previous work? Yeah, this one. I challenge you. Oh, that's so stupid. No, that doesn't work. No, you've got to use the magic pen. What if I put one... Yeah, that's stupid. We'll see. Okay. I don't agree. Sorry. You had two choices. That's going to be drawn. Or not. Too bad. I'll put it here. Then we're going to put it there. Damn. No one wins. Difficult choice. This is a very interesting design. I'm not sure. Me? It's just the same as normal. I had it done in the... Well, it has a LCD. Yeah, I think. Then do it correctly. Okay, wait. I'm going to draw something. What? Okay, I'm going to guess what you're drawing. Okay, blank. No, not a new one. A house. You have to use the pen. Not everything. Yeah, everything. It wants to know what we do in our spare time. Okay. It's a house. I can know it. It's a very hard to draw. Okay, that makes it easier. I think I know. No, wrong. I think I know what you're trying to draw, but it's wrong already. It's very... Yeah, you missed the right five. Oh, my God. No, you're wrong. A little bit, maybe. See where you're wrong now? The entrance. Warning, finish meeting now. All right, okay, the entrance is more to the left. Warning, you're correct. Okay, but I think this part... Yeah, but... I think... Oh, no, you made another mistake. Oh, yeah, there are a lot of mistakes because the walls are thick like this. There's a big hole here as well. Oh, that's true. That's the kind of big mistake. They're walking behind the walls. Warning, finish meeting now. Guys, I think we have to finish the meeting. Okay. Okay, this is a hard one. Warning, what does it say? Fill in the questionnaire. What now? Come on. Okay. Okay. No more chit-chat. Over there. I'm going to be so lonely. Clean that up later. That's my exit face. I'm going to edit it smiley. Don't do it all. Bye. Oh, God. Okay. Okay.
