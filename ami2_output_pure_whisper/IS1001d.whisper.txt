 It's cutting a rocket par Kataya. I know, the rocket maybe has a rocket which itself does not look like a mana. Okay, how is everyone? So we are here for the detailed design meeting. So we will first present what we are going to do in this meeting. Then I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you a summary then as usual. We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by two colleagues that make good work. Then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product. We will evaluate the product and with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with the requirement or not. So let's start with the cost aspect. So I look at the aspect discussed last time, that is to say to have a standard battery, to have a yellow banana shaped case with a rubber material rounded to be two feet spongy. Also, the different aspects like having a wheel etc. The cost is 10.7 euros, which is good because we had a price cap of 12.5 euros. For the financial aspect it is okay. We can continue with this product as if and we are now going to see the project evaluation with our marketing expert. Yeah. So you can have my project in? You have a presentation? Just for evaluation. Okay. So you can go through? Okay. So I made an evaluation and the evaluation criteria is made according to the user's requirements and the market trends. We talked about during the previous meetings. So you can go through and... Okay. Okay. So we have six points. We talked about before. So we want to have a product fancy look and feel. Technological innovative, easy to use, fashion, easy to find in a room and robust. Yeah. And I have a scale of seven points. Yeah. So I go through all the points here and according to what you think about this project, you can make one point to point or seven points. Okay. And after we have an average and we see. Okay. Okay. So fancy look and feel. What do you think? Okay. Maybe you can... Between one and seven. Okay. Maybe... So I think it's very nice. I give it five. Yeah. So it's between one and seven. Yeah. Seven is the highest. Seven. I will give a six. I will give a five. Oh, sorry. Just go to the crosstalk. No, I just want to see something. Maybe we would have to agree on that comment. Well, we can take that as it is. Yeah. I think... All right. And we'll do that as well. No problem. I don't know if we have to put one if it's better or... One is most... Uh-uh. Well, we can choose what we want. Yeah. Okay. Let's say that seven is the best. Seven is the best. Okay. So... So do not the grade where five... Six for me... Five. Five. Oh, sorry. What you tried. Six. How much would you give on the fancy aspect? I'm not even patient about it. You can... How much what? How much would you... You don't answer to this question. Oh, yeah. I don't know. I think six. It's a good... So you have 5.5 average. 5.5 average. Yeah. Okay. Can fit. Okay. Well, it's easy. Hi. Sorry. Okay. So after the technological aspect... Okay. Technology. Technology. So we said we have a new technological thing with the wheel. Yeah, we have the wheel. We also have the rubber material, which makes it like new or so. I think I would give a five. No, give a four. Four? Four. So. Because except the wheel, we don't have so much innovation. The rubber is... Okay. I wouldn't leave the voice. I would include the voice again. Or not. No. No. Okay. So... No. What's your grade? Four. Four. So we have four, four, and five. You can put four. Yeah, four. Everyone is okay or four. Four. Yeah, let's put four. Four. Okay. Doesn't it? Yes. Easy to use. Do you think it's easy to use? Yeah. I think so. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. I would give a... I would give a seven as well. It's very easy to use. Six for me or four? Six. Six. Five. Six. Six. Okay. Is it fashion? Oh yeah, it's food. Seven. Shape. I would say seven. And it's very, very nice. It's fashion because it's a food. And we say that same. A couple of seven here. Yeah, seven. Seven. Okay. I hope. Easy to find in a room. I lost my banana. I think you got me seat. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I think it's cool. I think we'll put the six here. We have the lightning. Oh. Yeah, we have the... We don't see... Especially the... The transparent so the lights up completely. So it's yellow. It's okay. I think it's very easy to... Seven. I would say seven. It's hard to miss it. Six. Yeah. Is it robust? Yeah, it's rubber. It's rubber. It's made of rubber. I think it's more rubber than other remote controls. The only problem that I might be able to do is with the wheel. I don't know if it's very sensitive. Yeah. Yeah. But it is surrounded by rubber and mud. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe we can put the six. Yeah. Everybody is... Six. Okay. Six. Okay. Okay. Now. This is in. So... We have to survive in the direction. 13. 26.5. 32. 36. That's okay. Six. Okay. Six is a good. If we say that's seven, it's a better. Yeah. Okay. Six is a good product, I think. So it's a good evaluation, I think. It's very promising. We have a little bit biased. We have a good price and... Yeah. Okay. So this prototype is quite nice. Because I saw some phones that were banana shaped wireless phones, not mobile ones. Not in house. Quite big also. They were selling here and something like 100 euros, 200 euros. Just a phone. So having these at 25 euros is quite attractive, I think. Yeah. I think the... Also the complexity between phone and remote control is not... Yeah. It cannot compare. Yeah. Yeah. It might not look good. So I think we can summarize. So we have seen the prototype, it's very nice. According to the work of two designers, the financial aspect were okay. We have the cost below a threshold. So we could sell 25 euros and make profits. The evaluation gives satisfying results as well. So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting. So the cost is in the budget. The evaluation is okay. So I think we can open champagne and make a huge party. I don't know if it's provided by the meeting staff. Okay. Okay. So congratulations. Congratulations to the team. We will go together. Fantastic. Yeah. I think it was a good collaboration aspect. So what does the management say? Sorry. What does the management say? I think we will have a much bigger project this time and a much bigger salary as well. Yeah. Well, it depends on who watched this meeting. Yeah. We don't know. Okay. Okay. So good guys. Also see you for our next successful project. Yeah. Good. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Good. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay.
