 I guess you can do it. Did you get my email with the stats? I'm going to change off. I'm going to change off soon. You're all right. It's okay. I'm going to change off soon. You're all right. It's okay. I guess I have to change the pen otherwise. Can you come through to it? Don't know. Maybe the pen is supposed to go over the seats. Maybe the seat is four rather than the person. Do you think? Yeah. I'm going to do this. Yep. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. Yeah. I'm going to do this. Okay. So, Marshall is late again. Probably an important man. So, well, it is important for him to be here. Yeah. So, what I do? You did work together. Yeah. So, I would be able to summarize our meeting. Yes. I think it would be very important if the as main designer will be important that he is here. Yes. Basically, we designed two items. Yes, but we... Can we have a phone or can someone... Yes, we should phone him. It's really well designed. When he's not here, we will just have to continue. So, just for a record, I will take notes again. Okay. And... Well... First thing, I was... I got an email from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget. The budget of the 12 euro and 50 cents. He said to me, well, when you stay in, it's good. When you don't stay in, you have to redesign. There is no negotiation possible in this matter. So, we have to consider that. Good. So, maybe Anna, you can have your first thing. Oh, we had an evaluation until we had a design. Hello. Okay. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Sure. Great, great. Well, maybe then you can start now with your designs. Yeah. So, I will start by the basic one that fits into eight euros, actually. Right, seven, eight euros. And, well, first, for both, they have a special shape. Maybe the designer can explain better than me. But it's like a surfboard. And you are supposed to surf to browse, to surf TV, maybe the web. And it's kind of interesting shape because unconsciously, people want to surf. And also, it's not too far from a mobile. So, people are used to that kind of shape. Don't take care too much about the color because we will... No, we are supposed to give some offers. So, here would be basically the infrared eye. Hi. Let the LED... The on-off button. Here would be the volume on the left. Okay. So, easy to turn on and off. And so, this is a very cheap version. So, there are... Maybe you can carry on with you. Also, you have browsing the channels, actually. So, you can go up and down the channels. If you have a video or something, it can forward. How can you change from VCR to TV, by the way? Oh, no, no, no. This is a model with just a TV one. No, no, sorry. This is a standard TV one. We are not talking about that. So, and then we have usually... There are 12 keys, but we know that we have only 10 digits. And then we have an extra two for having... Or giving an option for having more than one channel. And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to go out through from that. Okay, so, it's a very basic... It's a very basic minimal thing which is also available in the market. Actually, that's what it is that they... And it costs us to build this about 8 euros. Except for the special shape, the surfing board. It has a quite conventional layout of buttons. So, this one model and... Can I say? Yeah, sure. Yeah, I like the volume control. That's good. This is a magic one, but right now we don't want to talk about that. It is a very futuristic. It's like a brain, machine interface and all this stuff. We are thinking about it in the future. It can come. So, it doesn't actually have buttons. So, that... Then what we look... Do you want to say? Yeah. This is a model, yeah. I just... Look how it feels. Oh, yeah. It really feels like... Like a mobile phone. Yeah. Just sign. Yeah, see. I really want to talk to it. But... Yeah, you want to talk to that? So, but you continue with your gr... So, well, then the... This is a more... A little... A smooth and it gives you a lot of functionality in this way. So, all we have... You see that there are only 6 keys, but don't worry. They are doing the job of tool keys actually here. And so, they have more space, actually. And it's easy to... Use this. And... You have a... So, this is a standard URL infra-red I. And then you have a power button. It should volume what you have. And then, other than that, you have a channel up and down and the flow of pause or... Slow-those. Yeah. And then, you have LCD display here. And this is the functional thing which can change, like... It's a toggle switch, which could change the function. Say... It's a DVD player to tell if it's easy. Yeah, I can change it to... Instead of having many switches. And then you get feedback, fire, LCD... LCD can display, what is that on that? And... Well, you can have an integrated microphone over here. This is the...... or an button here. So... Which can... Basically, you want to do a speech recognition and the channel or whatever information can be displayed here directly on the......on your display. And here is a...... small LED, which is like blinking one, which tells you like... Are you running out of the battery and which is...... can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier. Okay. And... Well, then we have a cover, basically. Basically, you don't need much other time this. When you need, you can use it. And this gives additional fascinating that tomorrow you want, you can add a tactile thing to this cover, you know. For example, design and... But... But...... India...... when this is closed... Yeah.... will also cover up the LCD screen. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's basically to do that. But the LCD screen, I mean, is a very......... well, an eye-attracting feature with... Actually, when you're watching the TV... Actually... When you're watching anything or listening to them, you hardly care about what is getting displayed here, you know. You want to...... and this gives a protection to the LCD, actually, giving a cover to that, actually. It gives a protection because when it falls down or something...... it is... It's more robust. It's more robust that way. Yeah, okay. Yeah. And you have very good chances. It's low weight. You have to see. The components we put inside it is very low weight. Yeah. So the cost is actually a bit more. It's... It's 16 frames. 16 euros. 16 euros, okay. So that's where outside the budget then. Then it's out of budget. The main point we talk about that with our manufacturer. And they say basically that the ASR system would be...... something like three frames per item. Three euros. So you also... That's on top of the 16 or is it part of that? No, no, no, part of that. So it takes it down to 13 euros without the state check ignition? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well, if you can have... If you have new more ideas, we can add new more...... some more keys if you want to, you know. I think... Yeah, we should stick with a number of keys because if we add too much... Yeah, it should not be clapped, turning up everything. What's this one on the side? That's for the... it's kind of a LED for indicating your battery. Okay. And as well as it's like a blinking one, you can keep it the same. I like the shape of them. I do like the size and the shape. Before talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible, maybe you can give us your... Okay. Maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products, both of these two. Yes, the evaluation and also the evaluation criteria. So what is important to look at? Best guess what we've talked about already. From the marketing point of view, we just want to make sure that we've taken into account... Well, just... Yeah.... do it quickly if we all already... So it's just a short list of criteria on the things that we identified as being important to selling the product. We just go through these and rate them as a group, and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that. So I just average this score of those items. So these are the things we're identified as being important. The three things were look and feel, innovation and ease of use. They're three important components. Appealing to the correct demographic. So using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic. And then following the company motto, following the fashion trends and putting the end of the product as well. So we'll go through and put through those on the two products now and discuss them further and then evaluate them. No, why not discuss it now? Okay. So I've just got through on the whiteboard, I guess. I'm just going to come in. So the first one was really very far below budget. Would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have a high profit on it? It was running a make up to eight euros and we have a... Well, my personal view is when this one is eight euros, we must think how can we improve it. And then, I mean, you must just see it as we can still spend this four and a half euro. And because the selling price is already quite fixed on 25 euros. So we just have to offer as much as value for the customer he can have for 25 euro. Okay, so looking for innovation. So bad. And now it's easy to use. Easy to use. Ojon's target. And trends. Are we following the idea of using the removable covers on these? Is that part of my thumb? We can still discuss that. And together with evaluating this, we might come with new ideas in adding things or removing options because they are too expensive. I've received a framework which we can do this. This is the latest price of our production unit for several components. So we can see whether the price is within the 12 euro worth 50 cents. So maybe we can start with this calling this one. Yep. So that's the thing. This is the first design. Another one's green. Yes. Okay, so look and feel. Well, one is a brick and a pen again. There is another pen. Yeah, get that one. One's bad and seven's the best. So one's true and seven's false. One's the best. Okay. So I'll just gather one to seven. Okay. So look and feel. Well, you already feel it pretty much, I think. In my opinion, if you really feel it's very good. It's very good in your hand. So I would consider two or maybe even one for feels. But that's just half. We should also consider the look. And then it looks quite conventional. Don't you agree? Okay. On the scale, it's between functional and fancy. Basically, we're looking at. So say five. It's my opinion, but I don't know what to do. Well, I will give it to my wife. We have any way the way we have designed this like the surf. As we say, you know, it doesn't look as fine, but still, I will give four in that game. Yeah, four maybe. Oh, yeah. Then we should have one for. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's not. Okay. Can you maybe fix the other? Yeah. You should print like this, not like this. When you. No, it's the. No, can you get the batteries? No, no, that's falling down. That's not the ink. That one. Yeah. That's not the ink. That's the, that, that one. Yeah. That's not. No, no, it's not that. It's here to close the battery. Okay. Yeah. No, it should be. No, I think it's lost a battery. Right. It's right. No, it's. It's still right, but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors. I think that another battery there. Oh, yeah. You got a second. Troy. Oh, we got a tell. Yes, it has a. Perfect. Is that working? Did it come out? Good. Good. Because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working. It's just normal whiteboard marker, but it wouldn't be picked up in the actual whiteboard. Yeah. Okay. So. Then then. The other one. Wow. I think it's slightly better. It's hard to tell from us the first scene, but. When we want to include, I'm doubting about this component. It breaks in your game. No, actually, this is not going to protrude, actually. Okay. It's not a button. It's a lead. It's a lead, actually, which will be coming in a call. Actually, yeah, it should be embedded. It should be embedded there. Yeah. So it won't be really, you know, protruding or something. You can push it again. You can push it. Yeah. The other thing is, it's the left hand one protruding because if people are left handed, the one needs other hands. Yeah. It works so well. No, it's not protruding, actually. It'll go embedded into that. Well, I'd say two or three for that one, personally. Which was three than two. I think the look is better, but the feel is worse. So I would also say this is four. Okay. But what do you think? Oh, it's fine. I think. No, just that the feel is that you, right now you don't see the feel because, I don't follow them, but if you press it quite inside, now like this. Now it's embedded one. Yeah. This is how the embedded one is. Yeah, it's basically the same shape. Yeah. It's basically the same thing, actually. You will be. Except that in this... The very CD makes it better. Yeah. And you may have a slight thing for to follow. Yeah, it's definitely more fancy than that one. Yeah. Okay. I would say two or three. Okay. So consensus, two or three? Two. Two. Yeah, two is good, yes. So two. Okay. Okay. Innovation. First one. There is no innovation. The first one compared to what exists in the market. No, but except for the design of the surf. Yeah. What feature should we actually include? Including a location kind of thing? I'm trying to find it. I don't know. I think it's one of the feel. But there's no actual innovation in that at all. It's just a straight out remote control. Yeah. The only innovation is to shape. Yeah. So there's no... That's a looking field thing though. It's not a technological innovation. Yeah. So I'd be up for seven for innovation. Yeah. And the second one is really state of the art. Yeah. In terms of innovation. And with many more functionalities, can open and impose the... Yeah, it is. Yeah. LCD screens. Yeah. That's... Well, quite. Any of the squirting buttons and menu and programmable device behind this. You could put it at one or two. Okay. That's not right. Yeah. So what are the innovations? This got the LCD screen. Yeah. Automatics feature recognition. Is that in this one though? Is this... Because this is the... No. There were two different options we discussed then. We discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget. We discussed it as you all designed it and then we all tried it. Okay. So the cost for these were... Get in the budget. What was the cost for the first one? Eight euros? Eight. Actually, we have to check again. Yeah, I do. And this one was 16 euros. 16 euros. Okay. So... Innovation for this one is two. One. It's not two. I would say two. Two. And to be one, what would we do in it? Actually, I don't see... Why? Okay. One would be without a button. Yeah. Well, this feature recognition is a very good innovation. I believe it's a... So maybe... It's a... With the speech recognition. It's using speech recognition. Okay. Give that. Give it a one. It works. Yeah. Then it's... I see one. Okay. Ease abuse. So the first one is re-standouts, so everybody... Is used to it, yeah. Can use it. They are used to it. Yeah. So that's maybe a two for ease abuse. Yeah. Here, the main... The other one is quite easy. Though... Though it has more functionality, I think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it, actually. So maybe a three or four. Yeah. Actually, in fact, I think it will be... Yeah. Maybe sometimes people get scared with the number of buttons. Yeah, but... There's... Like I would say three... Four. Okay. Well, we have reduced the key, actually. You see. Three is fine. Yeah. Because it's... It's not like a big one with 100 buttons. Actually, the user has to put some effort to do use that, actually. It's not so easy. Like this one, the normal. Yeah, but then when he used to it, it's quite easy. It's quite easy. Yeah. Initially there, there was a lot of effort. Okay. Yeah. Good. So three, how will it go to the target demographic? So we're still thinking 20 to 40 year olds? 20 to 40, yes. This one would be for grandmothers. No, this would... I would give this model to the whole people. Yeah, one mother's, yeah. So it completely changed our demographic there. It's not part of the funky young thing. Except for the surfing shape. I mean, that's something with... As an appeal on this group, I think... If it was the very bottom price range, it was like between this and another one, which did the same thing. Then I can imagine it being a part of the demographic, yeah. But it's still... After this, we can consider, for instance, making this more attractive to the demographic. So I've got room, but some budget there to add a few things to it. But as it is now, I would say... Six? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Do you agree? I like the movie. Yeah, because it's so important. It was written that it was so important, the look and taking care of. It targets the right range of people. Yeah. But if you sell it in the market, it's going to be cheap, actually. Yeah. But it's going to be cheap, whatever, though. It was set with it. And people can still decide to use a cheaper one. Yeah. Instead of a... But for us, we have a concern that we need to sell at 25 euros. Yeah. There's nothing that would make me spend an extra few euros in that one rather than another one. Just paying 25 euros. I mean, it's not going to be cheaper. Okay, so in that case, well, it's fine. Okay. And the demographic of the second one? The demographic of the... It's got the toys in it. It's got the LCD screen. I think it's better because of the LCD screen, which really can appeal only on the... Yeah.... on the yep sign on the... Yeah. And if you want to target... Yeah, if we wish to sell four millions of this, I think for these agents, we need absolutely the LCD screen. Mm-hmm. So, you also need screen tracks. Yeah. Especially if we can have an LCD screen and a low range product and that's good. Yeah. Maybe that's something to consider. Okay. So, what... I'd probably go with three again for that one. Yeah, I think it has more market. Even one and two. Yeah. You know, I've saved you two. Yeah. Two. Two, yeah. Tomorrow, this will be more appealing because you can add a lot of investigation on that. Mm-hmm. Because then you have it... Yeah. You have a lot of things which you can include for the people. Yeah. And especially, I guess, this is the speech recognition as well. And that makes it more appealing, it's more of a new fun toy. We have to practically test it. The field test will tell you how good... Yeah. Okay, you find a point. And...... that's fine. So, the trends were the fruit and vegetables and there's bungee feel. Mm-hmm. So, as it is, not really doing either of them. I think spongy...... that means that it goes in the water. Well, spongy could be part of the field of the buttons as well. I know some...... who tried the mobile phones that have got the kind of spongy buttons? Not exactly spongy, but... I'm thinking one of the knockiest, it's got like...... you can't...... have got individual buttons, it's got just a...... bit on it and so it can...... that feels kind of spongy. This one includes this feature, right? Spongy buttons. Yeah, it's sort of... Yeah, it's sort of...... that way it can be. Okay. And maybe in the corner we can make it...... a foot and a veggie. But that's if you're using the covers. And then we can... Oh, is this... Yes, we can consider... Is it possible, do you think, to make a cover for such a phone? Well, they make up for mobile, so it can't be that much more. I do want to cover that, actually. Just with a flexible plastic... So you've got the option of having different colours or different textures? This is possible. Uh...... it's...... any shows? Yeah, I think it should be possible, like what you do with the mobile. Or just two things which can be put on each other. Yeah, if I do like...... not careful. Yeah. Yeah, I do like it. Alright. So...... maybe we can...... but we have to decide that we can put the...... fancy look of vegetables, for instance, to do these covers. And now try to invest in the features. I think the...... if we do the covers, that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in electronics. It lets you follow the latter's fashion. Even next year when Frid and Besh will not be out, you'll still be able to cover that and then it'll still be in fashion. Yeah. Because sometimes, look at this computer. This laptop is all black. And it's quite conventional. And sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours, like...... there's some presented here. So maybe we could do...... like in the range of the set of...... what we propose, a black one. Yeah. Very standard one. Yeah. And then the requirements of such people that want to really stand out things. And then you have the option of having different colours. Yeah. So that would make the trends equal, so we...... we really don't have... Yeah. That's the feature that could be included in either of them. Although it is more with the spandy buttons on the other ones. Yeah. So a point better for the... Okay. So... Two and three, or one or two? Yeah. Yeah. Say one, two. One, two. Okay. So I like to see...... so...... these are one of the spandy buttons. Yeah. So there's...... one of the spandy. Hmm. I see. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So the average of that is...... three, six, nine, about a five. So...... just added. One by six. One by six. One by six. One by five. One by six. One by eight, yeah. This one, eleven, thirteen, nineteen, twenty-one. Oh, five is four point two. One point two. Very good. Okay. But we still have a very different price to those two. So they're not really comparable yet anyway. We must try to get them closer. Yeah. Both of them here. Or we just have to choose and adapt. Because when we choose for this one, we have to...... we have to make it more attractive. And when we choose for this one, we have to make it more cheap. Well, it's easy to make that one cheaper by just taking this bit recognition out. That'll basically take us down to the budget. But I... Now, did you work with the same prices as I have here? So I give, you know, I just give a call with the money fixture and I expand them and they turn me. This could be possible for six euros. Unfortunately, we didn't see this shit. Yeah. Matthew. So maybe we have to recap with this one. Have you had to reconsider everything with this? Yeah. Well, yes. Well, you reconsider. So let's try to model this phone in this heat. What kind of energy source? We didn't speak about that. It's a normal battery or... Yeah, it might... it'll need more than a conventional one. It won't be a... just... Maybe you might use a AA battery actually. What do you say? For this one, it's a normal battery. Yes, just one battery. Okay. Electronics. Now, given speech recognition, I think you should go for your fans chip. Yeah. Some person. Yeah. Yeah. Simple sensor, yes. Simple. Yeah, this one. Yes, this one. Okay. Case. Um... So... Cloud... Double Cloud, yeah. I see. Double car. Yeah, it's going to be more than just the basic case, definitely. So which one are we talking to? Are you talking about these or that? Yes, we are talking about... But they have the same shape, but... Yeah. So it's going to be not basic cases. So this would be double carves? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Uh, Plashtik would be a... Yeah, the basic one. Yeah. Zero. Zero French. Special carves. Uh... Special car, now we leave to the carves. Uh... So now we're going... Bush Button or LCD... LCD display. Yes. I see the display. Yeah. It's okay. Just say, LCD display. Is that price per unit or for the whole... Yeah, now this is per unit. So with names... There's a number of components. Yeah, we made me the scroll. We'll write for that. No, but for this one, it's true. No, for that one also. The author? So, yeah, that's the scroll. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Yes, well, probably. So this comes to 18. And that's without any special button supplements. Yeah, one scroll really. So... So we'd have special colour, special form, special material, and all of them. I don't understand about them. So, I think... But do you agree that this... Wait a minute. It's not double curved. It's single curved, right? Because there is no... But I thought it would be curved on too. So it's curved on the size and curved on the top of the bottom. Yes, I understand what you mean here. I understand what you mean here. So, there is only... There is nothing like... You know, in the other stuff... You're talking about concave curves. Yeah, concave. So I think we can put... You think a single curved? A single curved, like 16. That makes 17. And whether the... Buttons, we have tried buttons, are you sure? Yes. We have more, we've got the scroll wheel on the side. So I had a bad extension. Bad extension. Bad extension. We have... We haven't talked about a lot, but that's not... A lot is very inexpensive, I believe, but it's not in the list. We've got a scroll wheel for the bottom, don't we? Or is it some other thing that's not on there? Is this a scroll wheel or is this a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides? So far. Okay, we've only got five minutes left, guys, so we need to wrap it up pretty fast. Yes, you can scroll to it. So this is more than the... And the cost you gave for 16 years? Okay, so based on that, yeah. Where is that? Yes, I'll get some of this picture. That is the sample sensor and sample speaker. So... Let's do that. We just need that, actually. Where... we need one. We could go for the... for the... for a simple chip, but then we can't have the speech recognition, yes? No, we can't, yeah. So when we... But this would be cutting the speech recognition. Yeah, but if you have the near-the-rcd, you can choose... select between... you know, universal between audio, TV and VCR. And this needs a... needs an advanced chip. Transchip. Right? Hi. Oh, you're on a chip? I think it's going to be... I think it's going to be... I think it's regular. Yeah, it's going to be... You can do that. With the regular chip, yeah. Yeah, it's a regular chip. Yeah, it's a regular chip. Yeah, it's a regular chip. So... and what about the number of buttons? Just... that... maybe... Well, we can just say... Matthew. Uh... What is this? When... When you look at this... this... item... Yeah? Okay, look, we just... when we just want to... to cut the number of buttons, we have to make 7 to fit in 12... 1250. So is it possible? I... but the 7 basic buttons... or 7 buttons that any adds on... Without special colors or form or material. Well, we... then we have to ask the user to press itself. You're gonna make a phone to your boss saying 2550 is really... Pffft... Ha ha ha ha ha ha... No, no, no, ha ha ha... Ah ha... So the LCD place is three francs. Sorry, three euros. Five-sef. And we don't want to change that right. And we really want to add the LCD otherwise we wouldn't get the market. Otherwise... You are very normal......thing like this. Yeah. So... 12 euro 50. We got two off of the battery. We can't do anything about that. So, 1050. What else do you have to write the display? That's 750. So, a 750 to use for the case and for the buttons. And the chips. So, the chips. Up there already. So, we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget. There's no doubt about that. So, what each of us think about the......because it's a major point in the LCD. Do you think it's important? Oh, we could even replace them by buttons. Because sometimes when you watch the TV in fact you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more on your hands. I don't know. Actually, it depends. It depends what kind of functionality you want to add into it. For example, if you add two more functionality, then better you add two more buttons there. Instead of LCD display. Which is that is going to bring the cost by two euro at least. I think unless we can really drive these prices down, we need to get rid of the LCD display. Okay. So, we can get rid of it and then add......but we want that. On the market point of view, yeah. What do you think LCD is a major feature? For the price, it's going to be what we can afford. And it's looking like we can't afford the LCD display. There's no way we can get it in there. I think we have to come to a decision now. I think what we just do is fold. About the LCD display. You assume you want a democratic voice? Yes. One man, one fold. So, who thinks the LCD display should be in it? I'd like to be in, but I can't see it happening. I think, but... You have power, a veto anyway, as project manager. Yeah, but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that. Well, we have to make a decision now. Yes. So, having an LCD display is just a very limited amount of buttons. Is that acceptable? Can your functions be implemented in... Yes. You agree? So, having seven buttons instead of twelve. Yeah. So, that would be cutting, say about these buttons. Because one... Show me that. Actually, we could, in fact, remove these three buttons and have three possibilities for each of the three here. Here one at the middle and... I think we're really losing as of years. Okay. That would create another problem. But the people to use it is not going to be easy. Okay. So, I think we should go to LCD screen. That's my opinion. No, it's okay. You cut the LCD scene and introduce two more buttons. Okay. So, LCD is out. The speed rig out now, we've... The speed rig condition is ours. Yeah. Because of the budget. Yeah. Okay. Now we can just... So, I'll be basically back to the original one now. Back to the first version. Which turns out to be on budget exactly pretty much with these new costings. So, just look at that one and look at that one now. Yeah. I think we just go for this one. That now 12 euro is the price. Okay. Okay. So, we're glad that it's 50 cents. Yeah. Cheap reduction. So... We wouldn't need the really expert designers. Yeah. Because they're home. Yeah. So, we can go back and talk to the suppliers. We see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in. But that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment. Okay. Good.
