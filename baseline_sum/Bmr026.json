{"filename": "./data/Bmr026.txt", "transcript": "0:00:00\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, we're on. So I think this is going to be a pretty short meeting because I have four agenda items.\n\n0:00:05\tSPEAKER_05\n Three of them were requested by Jane who is not going to be at the meeting today. So The first was transcription status. Does anyone besides Jane know what the transcription status is?\n\n0:00:19\tSPEAKER_06\n Sort of. I do it peripherally Well, first of all with IBM, I got a note from Brian yesterday saying that they finally used the tape for the thing that we sent them a week or week and a half ago and that it's gone out to the transcribers and hopefully next week will have the transcription back from that and I've been pan Jane seems to be Moving right along on the transcriptions from the X-E side. She's assigned I think probably Five or six. Yeah, I think we're up to MRR 13 or something. Yeah, so I guess she's hired some new transcribers and which meetings is she transcribing?\n\n0:00:58\tSPEAKER_06\n Well, we've we've run out of 80 years. Okay, because a certain number of them are sort of awaiting to go to In the rest are in processing\n\n0:01:08\tSPEAKER_02\n We're doing it. So in parallel. She has transcribers right now who are risky sitting idle because there's no data back from oh\n\n0:01:14\tSPEAKER_05\n No, no, no, we're not waiting on the process. So they're they're doing the full transcription process. Oh, okay\n\n0:01:19\tSPEAKER_02\n So you're doing the real thing. It's we're doing parallel. Yeah, I need to ask Jane whether it's it would be okay for her Some of her people to Transcribe some of the initial data we got from the smart com data collection, which is these short like five or seven minute sessions And we want it, you know, we need again, we have a similar Logistics setup where we're supposed to send the data to Munich and get it back But to get going we would like some of the data transcribe right away so we can get started. Yeah, that's what I mean And so I wanted to ask Jane if You know, maybe one of the transcribers could could do I mean since these are very short that should really be\n\n0:02:04\tSPEAKER_03\n There's only two channels\n\n0:02:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, yeah, it's a synthesis thousand have to be transcribed I think so yeah So so it's basically one channel to transcribe and it's one session is only\n\n0:02:15\tSPEAKER_04\n So that should have made many fewer and it's also not a bunch of interruptions\n\n0:02:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Right and some of it is red speech. Yeah, so we could give them the the thing that they're reading and they just make sure it's right and so I guess I was gonna ask her but she's not around Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay with you to you know, yeah\n\n0:02:43\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, if we're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to compensate that's okay because I Still have high hopes that the IBM pipeline will work out for the results\n\n0:02:54\tSPEAKER_06\n Yeah, and also related to the transcription stuff So I've been trying to keep a web page up to date Showing what the current status is of the trends of all the things we've collected and what stage each meeting is in in terms of Whether you mail that out to the list. Yeah, well, that's the thing that I say out just a few people saying can you update these pages?\n\n0:03:14\tSPEAKER_06\n And so that's okay, okay, I'll send it out to the list\n\n0:03:18\tSPEAKER_05\n I haven't done that so I have lots of stuff to add Yeah, just in my own directly try to get to that okay, so Jane also wanted to talk about Participant approval, but I don't really think there's much to talk about. I'm just gonna do it and If anyone objects too much then they can do it instead You are going to I'm gonna send out to the participants With links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to Suggest edits and then believe them out Okay, for the ones that we have\n\n0:03:52\tSPEAKER_03\n But it's just transcripts not the not the audio. No, they'll have access to the audio also\n\n0:04:00\tSPEAKER_05\n I mean that's my intention because transcripts might not be right\n\n0:04:03\tSPEAKER_06\n So you want people to be able to listen to them so the audio that they're gonna have access to will that be the Un compressed version or will you have scripts that like uncompressed the various? Oh, that's a good point\n\n0:04:13\tSPEAKER_05\n That's good point. Yeah, it's it's probably gonna have to be the uncompressed versions because It takes too long to do random access to compression\n\n0:04:24\tSPEAKER_06\n Yeah, I was just wondering because we're Running out of the unbacked up\n\n0:04:28\tSPEAKER_05\n That was the other point. Oh, was that another yet another agenda item so But that is a good point so we'll get to that too DARPA demo status not much to say the backend stuff is working out fine. It's more or less ready to go I've added some stuff that Indexed indexes by the meeting type MRE to you, etc. And also by the user ID So that the front end can then do filtering based on that as well the backend is Going more slowly as I think I said before just because I'm not much of a tickle TK programmer and And Dave Galbart says he's a little too busy. So I think Dawn and I are gonna work on that and And you and I can just talk about it offline But the backend was pretty smooth. So I think we'll have something it may not be as As pretty as we might like but we'll have something I want to when we would reach Dave's saturation point\n\n0:05:24\tSPEAKER_04\n Been volunteering for everything and yeah Okay, finally said he was too busy\n\n0:05:31\tSPEAKER_05\n I guess we reached it. Yeah, he actually he volunteered, but then he's then he retracted it so oh well\n\n0:05:39\tSPEAKER_01\n And also I was just showing Andreas I got I'm an x waves kind of display and I don't know how much more we can do with it with like the Prasadik stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and The transcripts on the bottom. So right now it's just an x waves and you have three windows, but I don't know Look pretty nice. I'm sure it's potential for a little something. Yeah, so I\n\n0:06:02\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, so again the issues for July the issues gonna be what can we fit into a windows machine?\n\n0:06:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, so it might just be slides. Yeah, okay. Well, we'll see\n\n0:06:16\tSPEAKER_03\n I've been putting together transcribe all things for Windows So and I installed it on Dave galots PC and work just fine. So hopefully that because there's some people\n\n0:06:28\tSPEAKER_02\n It would be cool if we could get that to work at SRI because the\n\n0:06:34\tSPEAKER_05\n We have more windows machines transcribe is tickle tk very generic with snack so basically anything\n\n0:06:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, it's snack to run on yeah, but the problem is the version Transcribe works with the snack version is 1.6 whatever and that's not anymore supported It's not on the web page anymore, but I just wrote an email to to the author to the snack author and he sent me the 1.6 Whatever library and so it breaks it was packaged with transcribe yeah, but then you can't add our patches at then The new version is is totally different and in in terms of the source code You you can't find the tickle files anymore. It's some whatever wrap thing and you can't you can't access that so you have to install First install tickable then install snack and then install the transcribe a thing and then do the patches\n\n0:07:24\tSPEAKER_02\n I wonder if if we should Contribute our changes back to the author so that they maintain those\n\n0:07:32\tSPEAKER_06\n We have yeah, it's just hasn't made it into the release yet. Okay, so did you put the The anti version out on the meeting report page or no, I haven't done that yet\n\n0:07:43\tSPEAKER_03\n No, but I definitely will do that so\n\n0:07:47\tSPEAKER_04\n Can some of the stuff that don't talk me about somehow fit into this? I mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with that\n\n0:07:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it's basically ask you files or binary files whatever representation. It's just three different It's a waveform and just a stylized pitch vector basically so it's I mean we could do it a mat I mean you could do it a number of different places. I'm sure but it would be cool if the transcriber\n\n0:08:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, interface had like another window for the you know, maybe above the waveform Yeah, yeah, some arbitrary Valid function that yeah, that'd be very cool\n\n0:08:19\tSPEAKER_06\n You know, I'm using that again. It's time synchronous with the waveform. Yeah, more tickle tk\n\n0:08:24\tSPEAKER_05\n Programming so someone who's familiar with tickle tk has to do it, but it wouldn't be hard to do\n\n0:08:29\tSPEAKER_02\n But it would almost be like having another waveform displayed. Yeah, yeah\n\n0:08:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, yeah, maybe we could look into that. Yeah, but it seems to me that I it doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary So it seems to me you could do images\n\n0:08:48\tSPEAKER_01\n What do you mean by real time? Do you mean like you will scroll through it instead? Okay? Yeah, yeah, it would be cool to see it it would be cool like to see To hear it and see it and see the pitch contours also. I think you can do all that just statically in PowerPoint Yeah, I mean just record the clip and show an image. I just thought a few minutes lies. I thought you meant like just like\n\n0:09:15\tSPEAKER_04\n View graphs or something you know, yeah, so now we're talking about on the computer right and I think when we were talking about this before we had this little demo meeting we sort of set up a range of different degrees of live-ness that you could have and the more live the better But given the crunch of time we may have to retreat from it to some extent So I think for a lot of reasons I think it'd be very nice to have this transcriber interface be able to show some other Interesting signal along with it. So the big good thing to get in there, but Anyway, just looking for ways that we could actually show what you're doing and to people Because a lot of this stuff particularly for communicator Certainly significant chunk the things that we weaved our arms about originally had to do with prasadx and Nice to show that we can actually get them save them\n\n0:10:11\tSPEAKER_05\n And last that item on the agenda is disc issues yet again So we're doing okay on backed up. We're we're only about 30% on the second disc so We have a little bit of time before that becomes critical, but we are like 95% 98% on the scratch discs for the expanded meetings Yeah, and my original intention was like we would just delete them as we need more space But unfortunately we're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data All at once in a lot of different ways. There's a lot of transcribers, too Yeah, there are a lot of transcribers so all of those need to be expanded and then people are doing chunking and I want to do The permission form so I want those to be live so there's a lot of data that has to be around and Jane was going to talk to Dave Johnson about it one of the things I was thinking is we just got these hundred or excuse me 10 Spark blade So they command send blades. Yeah, something like him in the other day came in but they're not set up yet And so it seems to me we could hang Scratch disc on those because they'll be in the machine room They'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines And if we just need unbacked up space we could just hang discs off them. Well, is there why not just hang them off of\n\n0:11:30\tSPEAKER_06\n Abbott is there because there's no more room\n\n0:11:32\tSPEAKER_05\n I'm a disc racks on Abbott\n\n0:11:34\tSPEAKER_04\n What are we gonna get well?\n\n0:11:36\tSPEAKER_02\n You can just store the discs somehow well, but the sunblades have spare drive base You can put a new oh you mean you put them inside into boxes\n\n0:11:48\tSPEAKER_05\n Is the sun that these sun blades take commodity hard drives so you can just go out and buy a PC hard drive\n\n0:11:54\tSPEAKER_04\n And stick it in but if Abbott is going to be our disc server It file server it seems like we would want to get a second disc rack or something\n\n0:12:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Plus we're talking about buying a second disc file server\n\n0:12:09\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, I mean there are lots of long-term solutions what I'm looking for is where do we expand the next meeting? Yep\n\n0:12:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Well for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those 10 you know Dave jassen is gone for like 10 days Oh, I didn't know it left already. Well tonight. Oh well\n\n0:12:26\tSPEAKER_05\n I mean he won't set up the how much space to wait for this. I don't know what is going to be the baddest thing\n\n0:12:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I have I have an 18 gig drive hanging off on my computer all right, so Your computer's name You had an 18. Yeah, well, it's about I think there's about 12 gig left so with and you have an X drives Install yeah, okay, so I didn't realize it was so critical I mean I'm not doing anything on it right now until I get new meetings to transcribe with that a new transcriptions coming in\n\n0:12:56\tSPEAKER_06\n I really can't do anything. I'm not that I can't do anything. I just gave T-Lo some about 10 gigs the last 10 gigs of space that there was on habit and So but that but which one was that XG\n\n0:13:13\tSPEAKER_02\n XG that's also where we store the The up five Training set I don't think that's on XG on XG is only car but I've also been storing the feature files there and I guess I can Study leading some because now know what the best features are and we won't be using the old ones anymore\n\n0:13:33\tSPEAKER_01\n I have a lot of space then isn't that XH? I have a lot of space and it's not there's very little yeah, not for long But I mean it's not going on outside, but I'm using it\n\n0:13:45\tSPEAKER_05\n Probably only about four gig is on X on your X drive will definitely pay\n\n0:13:49\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's about four five gig because I love to see four meetings on there three or four meetings\n\n0:13:54\tSPEAKER_05\n Right, so okay, so that will get us through the next couple days We need another gig a quad\n\n0:14:05\tSPEAKER_04\n There should I should just be I should have a button Just press each meeting saying we need more despair Just we skip the rest of the conversation\n\n0:14:15\tSPEAKER_06\n We've collected so far something like 65 meetings and how much does each meeting take about a gig uncompressed\n\n0:14:25\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a little bit more as I usually don't do not uncompressed all of the pzm and the pda things right So if you uncompressed everything is even more\n\n0:14:34\tSPEAKER_06\n I pressed how much are they like half a gig for all of them yeah So we're definitely restoring You know all of those so there's what 30 some gig\n\n0:14:48\tSPEAKER_04\n I was just meeting so far so it's a hundred gig or something Because we have the uncompressed right also well, we haven't uncompressed all the meetings, but oh\n\n0:15:00\tSPEAKER_05\n We'd like to\n\n0:15:03\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, well, I mean it's they really are cheap. I mean it's just a question of figuring where they should be hanging them, but but we could you know if you want to get four discs get four discs. I mean it's it's\n\n0:15:16\tSPEAKER_06\n Small these things are just few hundred dollars. Yeah, why send that message out to I guess you and Dave asking for if we could get some disc I sent this out there a day ago, but in Dave didn't respond so I don't I don't know How the whole process works. I mean does he just go out and get them and yeah, it's okay and So I was assuming he was gonna take over that, but he's probably too busy given that he's leaving\n\n0:15:39\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, I think you needed direct conversation with him and just say they just asking that you know what what should you do and My answer back was a sure you just want one so I mean I think that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and Figure well here's what we've got figuring and doing for the next few months\n\n0:15:55\tSPEAKER_05\n I know what they want the Sissadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine So they don't want to stack up external drives And then they want everything else in the machine room right so the question is where are you gonna hang it?\n\n0:16:10\tSPEAKER_06\n Mm-hmm. I don't know what the space situation is in the machine room, right?\n\n0:16:17\tSPEAKER_04\n Right, so this is a question. It's pretty hard to solve without I think part of the reason why Dave can't get\n\n0:16:22\tSPEAKER_06\n What the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine\n\n0:16:25\tSPEAKER_02\n What what rearrangement one one thing to and to do when you need to conserve spaces I bet there's still some old like nine gig discs Around and you can probably consolidate them on to larger discs and and you know recover the space. Yeah\n\n0:16:42\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, no, I think Dave knows all these things the question and so he always has a lot of plans of things They're just gonna do to make things better in many ways, but I know that runs out of time\n\n0:16:52\tSPEAKER_05\n Generally their first priority has been for backed up disc and so I think what he's been concentrating on is the back the Backup system rather than on new disc so\n\n0:17:05\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, so but this this is a very specific question for me basically we can easily get One to four discs. I mean you just got to get four and we've got the money for it. It's no big deal But the question is where they go and I don't think we can solve that here\n\n0:17:19\tSPEAKER_02\n We can put some this in the in that back room there. Yeah, really\n\n0:17:24\tSPEAKER_04\n I attached to\n\n0:17:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Upcorn to the machine that collects the data So then you you could at least temporarily store stuff there\n\n0:17:31\tSPEAKER_05\n It's not on the net so it's a little what do you mean it's not on the net? It's not It's behind lots of firewalls that don't allow any service\n\n0:17:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh because it's because it's in a serial machine. Oh\n\n0:17:41\tSPEAKER_05\n And also on the list is to get it onto the normal X-NAT but Who knows when that will happen that might be it can't be that hard I mean sure No, the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire Running to that back room that goes anywhere near one of the X-E routers So they actually have to run a wire somewhere. Yeah\n\n0:18:02\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, Jen, you know any one of these things is certainly not a big deal if there is a person dedicated to doing it It would happen pretty easily, but it's it's Everybody everybody has a has well all of us have long less of different things we're doing But I mean I think that there's a there's a longer current thing and there's immediate need and I think we need a conversation with Maybe maybe after after T or something you and I can go down and talk to him Just say what you know what should we do right now how long is David gonna be gone?\n\n0:18:35\tSPEAKER_04\n 11 days or something Yeah, basically tomorrow and all of the week after\n\n0:18:46\tSPEAKER_05\n And that's all I have\n\n0:18:49\tSPEAKER_04\n Let's see the only thing I was gonna add was that I Talked briefly to Mari and we had both been busy with the things So we haven't really connected that much since the last meeting we had here But we agree that we would have a telephone meeting the Friday after next and I I wanted to make it After the next one of these meetings so something that we want to do next meeting is is to put together Kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it?\n\n0:19:26\tSPEAKER_04\n That we've done I mean just sort of bull ties. I mean, I can I can dream up text But this is basically gonna lead to the annual report so So just that we from tomorrow. Yeah, yeah, so we can this is gonna be in the morning\n\n0:19:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Or because you know at Fridays I have to leave around two\n\n0:19:56\tSPEAKER_04\n Sorry if it could be before that no, no, but I don't need other folks for the meeting Okay, all right all I'm saying is that I'm sorry. I miss understood. Yeah, so what I meant was on the meat this meeting Okay, if I was something I'm making a major thing on the agenda is I want to help in getting together a list of what it is That we've done so I can tell her I think I have a pretty good idea but but And then the next day like late in the day I'll be having that discussion with her\n\n0:20:29\tSPEAKER_02\n One thing I mean we in past meetings we had Also very very slowly talked about the work that It was happening sort of on the on the recognition side but isn't necessarily related to meetings specifically so and I wondered whether we should maybe have a separate meeting between You know whoever's interested in that because I feel that there's plenty of stuff to talk about but it would be sort of Maybe the wrong place to do it in this meeting Well, it's that It's just Gotta be very boring for people who are not you know sort of really interested in the details of the\n\n0:21:25\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, okay, so how many how many people here would not be interested in a meeting about recognition?\n\n0:21:32\tSPEAKER_06\n Jane\n\n0:21:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I know well Jane and where you mean in a separate meeting or talking about it We talked about how much overlap there will be yeah, so you're so so\n\n0:21:45\tSPEAKER_04\n Liz and Jane probably okay, so we're gonna have a guys meeting For all that way real real real men Real men do decoding\n\n0:22:01\tSPEAKER_02\n I Mean it's sort of I mean when when the talk is about data collection stuff sometimes I've\n\n0:22:08\tSPEAKER_04\n You know, I'm bored so it's I can sympathize with them not wanting to to be you know, I could you know this could need a better developed feminine side I The end of the week Yeah, I I've heard some comments like this and it could be I mean\n\n0:22:45\tSPEAKER_02\n And we don't have to do it every week we could do it every other week or you know whatever or whatever we feel like we alternate this meeting every other week\n\n0:22:53\tSPEAKER_05\n Or just alternate the focus that's what I mean. Yeah, so yeah, even weeks have to do that basic on I\n\n0:23:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Personally, I'm not in favor of more meetings\n\n0:23:02\tSPEAKER_06\n Um, right because I am I mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on meeting recorder\n\n0:23:11\tSPEAKER_05\n Right, so we keep going for a full time. Well cuz we get into these other times\n\n0:23:15\tSPEAKER_06\n Yeah, we feel obligated to collect more data So if we could alternate it just focus of the meeting\n\n0:23:21\tSPEAKER_04\n Why don't we just start with that and then if we find you know, we're just not getting enough done There's all these topics not coming up Then we can expand into another meeting, but I think that's a great idea. Uh, so It's chat about it with listen Jane. You can't see what they think that would be good\n\n0:23:40\tSPEAKER_06\n I mean Andreas and I have various talks in the halls and there's lots of things you know details and stuff that I think will be interested in I you know, where do we go from here kind of things and That would be good\n\n0:23:55\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, and you're you're attending the the front-end meeting as well as the others so you have you have Probably one of the best you and I guess have them and the main ones who sort of we're at sea the bridge between the two We are doing recognition in both of them\n\n0:24:11\tSPEAKER_02\n So So so we can talk a little bit about that now if there's something that would be for next week I just so the latest result was that um You know, I tested the sort of final version of the PLP configuration on development test data for for this years up five tests and and the recognition performance was Exactly, and I mean exactly up to the you know the first decimal the same as with the Marcapscha front-end for both emails and meals. Yes. Oh, well, it was a little bit of a Overall they were the males. I think we're slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really I mean definitely not significant and then the really nice thing was that if if we combine the two systems We get a one and a half percent\n\n0:25:12\tSPEAKER_05\n So just with Rover\n\n0:25:14\tSPEAKER_02\n With an investor over which is like our new and improved version of Rover which actually uses the whole Invest list from both systems\n\n0:25:24\tSPEAKER_04\n So it's that I mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end Which is the other aggressive versus the yeah?\n\n0:25:32\tSPEAKER_04\n sort of trinkets and\n\n0:25:36\tSPEAKER_02\n And and so after I told the my colleagues at us right about that you know Now they definitely want to you know have a next time we have an evolution they want to do you know basically at least the system combination And you know why not sure\n\n0:25:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Clearly gonna add a few more features though\n\n0:25:59\tSPEAKER_02\n What do you mean more features in the sense of front-end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles? No\n\n0:26:05\tSPEAKER_05\n front-end features you know we do PLP and Melcaps drillitz oh yeah, well gee right so we could yeah that's\n\n0:26:15\tSPEAKER_02\n There's one thing I mean you don't want to overdo it because every front end you know if you you know You basically multiply your effort by and where and it's the number of different systems and so so one one compromise would be to only To have the everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system and then After that you risk or your lattices with multiple systems and combine the results and that's a fairly painless I think you think we still get one and a half I think so yeah, maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower and so you know Maybe it's only one percent or something, but that would still be worthwhile doing so just You know just want to let you know that's working out very nicely and Then we had some results on digits We so this was really sort of just to get Dave going with his experiments and so But as a result, you know, we were sort of wondering why is the Hub 5 system doing so well on the digits and the reason is basically that there's a whole bunch of threads Each data have five training set including the end together and not all of no it's actually digits only a maybe a Fifth of it the rest is red is red timid data and Edas data and what's your travel?\n\n0:27:46\tSPEAKER_04\n Right, but a fifth is how much?\n\n0:27:48\tNone\n Fifth would be maybe Two hours, yeah, so I mean that's actually not that different from the right one training\n\n0:28:02\tSPEAKER_02\n But it definitely helps to have the other red data in there because we're doing You know, they are right as half of what you do if you train only on timid not timid T.I. Digits Which is only what two hours something right and so More red speech data definitely helps and you can leave out all the conversational data with no performance penalty\n\n0:28:23\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, that was the interesting thing that was it right because it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data\n\n0:28:27\tSPEAKER_02\n It would be better, but is there even more red speech data around? Oh, yeah, so we're only for the hub five training We're only using a fairly small subset of the microphone database So you could beef that up and probably do even better. I could also put in\n\n0:28:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Focus condition zero from hub four from broadcast news, which is mostly from here at speech\n\n0:28:51\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not exactly red speech, but it's pretty close right now. I mean there's plenty of red speech data I mean what's the journal. Yeah, that's right take one example but So you know that might be useful for the people who trained the Digit recognizes to use something other than T.I. Digits\n\n0:29:09\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, they've been using timet okay, that's the Experimented for a while with a bunch of different databases with French and Spanish and so forth because they're multi-lingual tests and And actually the best results they got were using timet But Using now but yeah, certainly if we If we knew what the structure of what we were doing there was I mean There's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of noise robustness algorithm So we don't know exactly which combination we're gonna be going with Once we know then the trainable parts of it may be great to run lots of lots of stuff through\n\n0:29:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, that was that and then I said guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem system and You want to\n\n0:30:04\tSPEAKER_06\n Yeah, so Andreas brought over the alignments that the SRI system uses and so I'm in the process of converting those alignments into Label files that we can use to train a new net with and so then I'll train the net and\n\n0:30:23\tSPEAKER_02\n And one side effect of that would be that it's that the fun site would change So the MLP would be trained on I think only 46 or 48 48 phones Which is smaller than the Then the phone site that that we've been using so far. Yeah, that that would probably help actually because the fewer dimensions It's the less trouble probably with as far as just the Just you know, we want to try things like delta's on the tandem features and so you have to multiply everything by two or three and so you know Fewer dimensions in the Frontside would be actually helpful just from a logistics\n\n0:31:07\tSPEAKER_04\n Sure, although we I mean it's not that many fewer and run and we take a KLT\n\n0:31:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Exactly, so so that was the other thing and then we wanted to just limited to maybe Something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard Frontend so that would mean just doing the top I don't know 10 or 12 or something of the KLT\n\n0:31:28\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, and I think the mention and we should again check we should start with Stefan my impression was the one we did that before that had very little He didn't lose very much. Right. I just taking the top whatever. Yeah\n\n0:31:40\tSPEAKER_02\n But then and then something once we have the new MLP trained up One thing I wanted to try just for the front of it was to actually run like a standard hybrid system that is based on you know those features and Retrained MLP and also the\n\n0:31:59\tSPEAKER_04\n You know the dictionary that we use for the up five system and the base starting off with the base of the alignments that you got\n\n0:32:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Exactly from pretty decent system. Yeah, so that would basically give us a More hopefully a better system Because you know compared to what Eric did a while ago where he trained up. I think a system based on broadcast news and then Train retrained it on switchboard. Yeah, and But he I think he didn't he probably didn't use all the training data That was available and his dictionary probably wasn't as tuned to Conversational speech as As ours so that's that's certainly one thing and the dictionary made a huge difference We made some improvements to the dictionaries to the dictionary about two years ago which resulted in a Something like a 4% absolute Air rate reduction and\n\n0:32:56\tSPEAKER_04\n The other thing is dipping deep to history into a resource management days when we were collaborating with us right before It was I think it was a real key Starting point for us that we actually got our alignment when we were working together We got our initial alignments from decipher At the time And later we got away from it because because once we had decent systems going Then it was it was typically better to use our own systems because they were self-consistent But that's certainly to start off when we were trying to recover from our initial 140% error Or But that was a good way to start it. We're not quite that bad with our our switchboard systems But it was certainly on as good as this arise\n\n0:33:41\tSPEAKER_06\n What is the performance of the best switchboard system that we've done?\n\n0:33:46\tSPEAKER_04\n Well the hybrid system we never got better than about 50% Here and it was I think there's just a whole lot of things that no one ever had time for we never did really Fix up the dictionary We always had a list of a half dozen things that we were going to do a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did But that we never did never did any adaptation right we never did any and that number\n\n0:34:11\tSPEAKER_02\n I think was on switchboard one day in our right Where they are right now is in the 20s Yeah, so yeah, we're probably least a factor too often so it would be so it would be good to sort of Re just at least to give us an idea of how well the hybrid system would do\n\n0:34:26\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, but I think again, it's yes, the cover is these conversational speech bit because our broadcast new system is actually pretty good\n\n0:34:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Right And the other thing that that will help us to evaluate is to see how well the NLP is trained up right because it's a pretty good Indicator of that so to the vicinity check of the NLP outputs before we go ahead and train up the You know use them as a basis of the tandem system. Yeah, it'll still probably worse\n\n0:34:55\tSPEAKER_06\n I mean it's no because independent should we bother with Using the net before doing Embedded training. I mean should should we even use that or should I just go through that's a good question\n\n0:35:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, we weren't sure whether it's worth to just use the alignments From the SRI recognizer or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of better track where you're real line\n\n0:35:20\tSPEAKER_04\n You run it keep keep both versions see which one's yeah, I mean I think I agree with I mean basically you would then you proceed with the embedded training Mm-hmm. It's gonna take you a while right training if it's net anyway and while it's training you may as well test the one you have and see\n\n0:35:36\tSPEAKER_05\n I could make arguments either way, but but so I'm well, but in your experience. I mean have you seen\n\n0:35:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Big improvements and on some tasks with embedded training or was it sort of small-ish\n\n0:35:48\tSPEAKER_04\n Improvements well dependent on the task. I mean I think in this one I would sort of expected to be important because we're coming from Alignments that were achieved with an extremely different system, right although\n\n0:36:00\tSPEAKER_05\n I mean we've done it with when we were combining with the Cambridge Recurrent neural net embedded training made it worse Which I've never figured out\n\n0:36:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Right, but I mean I think it's a bug so you started training with outputs from a with alignments that were generated by the Cambridge Yep a system and then Yeah, well that may probably just that was probably because your initial system. I mean your system was worse than Cambridge's and you Was it I don't think it was they were comparable really they were very close. That's weird Excuse me. That's weird. No, I mean it's weird that it's weird that it got worse\n\n0:36:49\tSPEAKER_04\n No Now we've we've seen I mean with the numbers OGI numbers task We've seen a number of times people doing embedded training. Oh actually it's not that weird because we have seen\n\n0:36:59\tSPEAKER_02\n We have seen cases were acoustic retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than yeah\n\n0:37:08\tSPEAKER_04\n But I would I would suspect that something that that had a very different Feature set for instance. I mean they were using pretty different similar feature sets to us Yeah, I would expect that something had a different feature set would would benefit from What about hidden unit size? Oh, wait a minute and the other thing Sorry, the other thing is that what was in common to the Cambridge system in our system is they both were training posteriors right, so I mean that's another pretty big difference and Went back at least you remember soft targets or\n\n0:37:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Sorry, I'm sorry. I missed what what's the key for here. Oh that\n\n0:37:50\tSPEAKER_04\n Both the Cambridge system and our system were we're training posters and if we're we're coming from alignments coming from the RIS system. It's a likelihood based system So so that's another difference. I mean there's different different front end different different training criterion I would think that in that in embedded Embedded training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more, but we don't know\n\n0:38:18\tSPEAKER_06\n Okay, yeah, I was wondering, you know what size net Anybody have any\n\n0:38:29\tSPEAKER_04\n How much training daddy?\n\n0:38:31\tSPEAKER_06\n Well, it's gonna start off with the small train set and how many hours is that so I'm not sure\n\n0:38:37\tSPEAKER_02\n I think that has about well, it would be gender dependent training, right? So so I think it's that's about 30 hours 30 hours per gender\n\n0:38:51\tSPEAKER_05\n Not sure what this will mean the small training I think so I'll\n\n0:38:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Excuse me. It's definitely less than 100. You know, it's more like Like 30 40 hours something like that wrong number\n\n0:39:05\tSPEAKER_06\n I called to tell us that yeah\n\n0:39:08\tSPEAKER_04\n so Too big right so At least a couple thousand units. I mean it's it's the thing I'll think about a little more But the toss up between 2000 to 4000 He definitely wouldn't want the 8000 it's it's more than a thousand. It's too small Well, let me think about it, but I think that that at some point there's diminishing returns I mean it doesn't actually get worse typically, but but there is diminishing returns and you doubling remember\n\n0:39:38\tSPEAKER_02\n You'll have a smaller output layer, so there's gonna be fewer parameters. Not like that 50\n\n0:39:45\tSPEAKER_05\n From the input unit\n\n0:39:47\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, yeah, yeah, I will have a very tiny effect\n\n0:39:50\tSPEAKER_05\n Or because you use the context when does and so the input to hidden is much. Oh, I see. I see. Yeah, of course. Yeah\n\n0:39:58\tSPEAKER_04\n So it should be way way less than 10% of difference There's\n\n0:40:05\tSPEAKER_06\n How big how big? I think the net that we did use already was 8000 in units\n\n0:40:12\tSPEAKER_04\n That's the one air trained up right and that was trained up on like 140 hours of Such under dependent or independent or so that would be like trained on 60 or 70 hours So yeah, definitely not the 1000 2000 I mean the 4000 will be better and 2000 will be faster and almost good\n\n0:40:34\tSPEAKER_06\n So maybe I'll start off with 2000. Yeah, see\n\n0:40:38\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, yeah 30 hours is like 10,000 seconds So that's like 11 11 million frames and 2000 in unit net is I Guess about 7800,000 parameters That's probably that's probably fine. I mean a 4000 is well within the range that you could benefit from but the 2000 be faster\n\n0:41:11\tSPEAKER_02\n I actually have to go all right\n\n0:41:14\tSPEAKER_04\n Uncle Bernie's rule is 10 to 1 Bernie Woodrose rule of Here's Uncle Bernie.
