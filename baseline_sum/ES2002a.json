Well, it's the kickoff meeting for our project.\n\n0:00:58\tSPEAKER_03\n And this is just what we're going to be doing over the next 25 minutes.\n\n0:01:06\tSPEAKER_03\n So, first of all, just to kind of make sure that we all know each other.\n\n0:01:12\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm Laura and I'm the project manager.\n\n0:01:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:01:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Do you want to introduce yourself again?\n\n0:01:17\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm David and I'm supposed to be a industrial designer.\n\n0:01:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:01:22\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm Andrew and I'm a marketing expert.\n\n0:01:27\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm Greg and I'm a hugeurnt face.\n\n0:01:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Great.\n\n0:01:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:01:32\tSPEAKER_03\n So we're designing a new remote control.\n\n0:01:35\tSPEAKER_03\n And, oh, I have to record he's here actually.\n\n0:01:38\tSPEAKER_03\n So that's David, Andrew and Greg as much.\n\n0:01:44\tSPEAKER_03\n And you're alive, don't you?\n\n0:01:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, we're designing a new remote control.\n\n0:01:52\tSPEAKER_03\n As you can see, it's supposed to be original trendy and user friendly.\n\n0:01:57\tSPEAKER_03\n So that's kind of our brief that we are.\n\n0:02:03\tSPEAKER_03\n And so there are three different stages to the design.\n\n0:02:06\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm already sure what you guys have already received in your emails.\n\n0:02:11\tSPEAKER_03\n What did you get?\n\n0:02:12\tSPEAKER_01\n I just got the project announcement.\n\n0:02:15\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm going to be designing a new remote control.\n\n0:02:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that's what everybody got.\n\n0:02:23\tSPEAKER_03\n So we're going to have individual work and then a meeting about it.\n\n0:02:28\tSPEAKER_03\n And repeat that process three times.\n\n0:02:34\tSPEAKER_03\n At this point, you get to try out the whiteboard over there.\n\n0:02:39\tSPEAKER_03\n So you get to draw your favorite animal and sum up your favorite characteristics of it.\n\n0:02:45\tSPEAKER_03\n So who would like to go first?\n\n0:02:47\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't want to go first.\n\n0:02:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Very good.\n\n0:02:53\tSPEAKER_00\n All right.\n\n0:02:56\tSPEAKER_00\n So.\n\n0:03:01\tSPEAKER_00\n This one here, right?\n\n0:03:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Mm-hmm.\n\n0:03:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:03:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Very nice.\n\n0:03:06\tSPEAKER_00\n All right. My favorite animal.\n\n0:03:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Is like.\n\n0:03:23\tSPEAKER_00\n How big of a go.\n\n0:03:32\tSPEAKER_00\n The favorite characteristics of it?\n\n0:03:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:03:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, basically, high priority for any animal for me is that they are willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family.\n\n0:03:49\tSPEAKER_00\n And they have lots of personality and be fit in robust good health.\n\n0:03:58\tSPEAKER_00\n This is blue, blue beagle.\n\n0:04:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Right?\n\n0:04:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Lovely.\n\n0:04:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, if my favorite animal would be a monkey.\n\n0:04:16\tSPEAKER_02\n And then the small cute and furry.\n\n0:04:28\tSPEAKER_02\n And when plant needs becomes real, I wouldn't be able to be with them.\n\n0:04:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Thank you.\n\n0:04:43\tSPEAKER_03\n You can take as long as this is you like because we haven't got an awful lot to this.\n\n0:04:50\tSPEAKER_03\n It's all what we do.\n\n0:04:51\tSPEAKER_03\n We do.\n\n0:04:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Don't feel like you're in a rash anyway.\n\n0:04:55\tSPEAKER_00\n I could tell you a lot more about beagles.\n\n0:04:58\tSPEAKER_00\n I could tell you.\n\n0:04:59\tSPEAKER_03\n I would have to get you up again.\n\n0:05:01\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:05:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Mine is.\n\n0:05:03\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm going to have to think of a spot.\n\n0:05:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Impressionist.\n\n0:05:09\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:05:12\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:05:13\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:05:14\tSPEAKER_03\n It's just the first animal I can think of to top of my head.\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_01\n I guess the bigger reason is because I'm allergic to most animals.\n\n0:05:26\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm allergic to animals.\n\n0:05:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Fish was natural.\n\n0:05:28\tSPEAKER_01\n And I kind of like wheels.\n\n0:05:32\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm coming in the middle.\n\n0:05:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Everything inside.\n\n0:05:35\tSPEAKER_01\n If I had a problem with my old and interesting thing.\n\n0:05:42\tSPEAKER_03\n I still don't know what I'm going to write about.\n\n0:05:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Super sketch by the way.\n\n0:05:52\tSPEAKER_03\n I was going to choose a dog as well.\n\n0:05:57\tSPEAKER_03\n But I just draw a different kind of dog.\n\n0:06:00\tSPEAKER_03\n My favorite animal is my dog at home.\n\n0:06:07\tSPEAKER_03\n That doesn't really look like him actually.\n\n0:06:13\tSPEAKER_03\n He looks like when I could pick actually.\n\n0:06:18\tSPEAKER_00\n I see a dog in there.\n\n0:06:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:20\tSPEAKER_03\n That's very good of you.\n\n0:06:22\tSPEAKER_00\n No, I see a rooster.\n\n0:06:29\tSPEAKER_03\n What kind is it?\n\n0:06:35\tSPEAKER_03\n He's a mixture of various things.\n\n0:06:40\tSPEAKER_03\n And what did I put him?\n\n0:06:43\tSPEAKER_03\n That's just a guess that his tail works.\n\n0:06:46\tSPEAKER_03\n He's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you.\n\n0:06:50\tSPEAKER_03\n And very kind of affectionate.\n\n0:06:56\tSPEAKER_03\n And he's quite wee as well.\n\n0:06:59\tSPEAKER_03\n He doesn't take up too much space.\n\n0:07:07\tSPEAKER_03\n And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail.\n\n0:07:10\tSPEAKER_03\n This is quite amusing.\n\n0:07:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Is he aware that this is his own tail?\n\n0:07:13\tSPEAKER_00\n He's chasing.\n\n0:07:14\tSPEAKER_03\n It is, I think it is.\n\n0:07:15\tSPEAKER_03\n He only does it after he's had his dinner.\n\n0:07:17\tSPEAKER_03\n And all of a sudden, he's get up and start chasing his tail.\n\n0:07:20\tSPEAKER_03\n He's around the living room.\n\n0:07:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Probably when he was little, he got lots of attention\n\n0:07:25\tSPEAKER_00\n for doing it and has forever been conditioned.\n\n0:07:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe. Where did you find this just down here?\n\n0:07:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:07:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe doing the next.\n\n0:07:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:07:45\tSPEAKER_03\n When I need to discuss the project finance.\n\n0:07:52\tSPEAKER_03\n So according to the brief, we're going to be selling this remote control for 25 euro.\n\n0:07:57\tSPEAKER_03\n And we're aiming to make 50 million euro.\n\n0:08:02\tSPEAKER_03\n And so we're going to be selling this one in international scale.\n\n0:08:07\tSPEAKER_03\n And we don't want it to cost any more than 1250 euro.\n\n0:08:12\tSPEAKER_03\n So 50% of the selling price.\n\n0:08:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Can we just go over that again?\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Sure.\n\n0:08:19\tSPEAKER_00\n So, basically.\n\n0:08:22\tSPEAKER_00\n All right.\n\n0:08:25\tSPEAKER_00\n So cost, like production cost is.\n\n0:08:28\tSPEAKER_00\n All together.\n\n0:08:29\tSPEAKER_00\n 1250.\n\n0:08:30\tSPEAKER_00\n But selling price is that wholesale or retail.\n\n0:08:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Like on the shelf.\n\n0:08:36\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:08:37\tSPEAKER_03\n I imagine that's a good question.\n\n0:08:39\tSPEAKER_00\n I imagine it probably is.\n\n0:08:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Or sale actually because it's probably up to the.\n\n0:08:44\tSPEAKER_03\n The retailer to sell it for whatever price they want.\n\n0:08:51\tSPEAKER_03\n But I don't know.\n\n0:08:52\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on highly designed at all?\n\n0:08:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:08:59\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it will.\n\n0:09:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Or right away, I'm wondering if there's like the DVD players if there are zones.\n\n0:09:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:09:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Regents and stuff.\n\n0:09:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Frequency or something.\n\n0:09:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:09:19\tSPEAKER_00\n As well as characters.\n\n0:09:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Different keypad styles and.\n\n0:09:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:26\tSPEAKER_03\n But for a more controlled, do you think that would be a spousal depends on how complicated our remote control is?\n\n0:09:31\tSPEAKER_01\n It doesn't make sense.\n\n0:09:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:09:43\tSPEAKER_00\n And then the other thing international is on top of the price.\n\n0:09:47\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm thinking.\n\n0:09:50\tSPEAKER_00\n The price might might appeal to a certain market in one region.\n\n0:09:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Whereas in another, it'll be different.\n\n0:09:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Or just like in terms of like well in the country, like how much money people have this band on.\n\n0:10:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Or just like basic product positioning.\n\n0:10:06\tSPEAKER_00\n The 25 euro remote control might be a big hit in London.\n\n0:10:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Might not be such a big hit in Greece.\n\n0:10:15\tSPEAKER_00\n You know.\n\n0:10:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Market in.\n\n0:10:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Good.\n\n0:10:20\tSPEAKER_03\n I should be writing all this time.\n\n0:10:50\tNone\n Right away.\n\n0:10:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Right away.\n\n0:10:56\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm making some kind of assumptions about what information we're given here.\n\n0:11:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Making.\n\n0:11:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:11:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Trendy probably means something other than just basic.\n\n0:11:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Something other than just.\n\n0:11:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Standard.\n\n0:11:08\tSPEAKER_00\n And.\n\n0:11:10\tSPEAKER_00\n So I'm wondering right away selling 25 years is that sort of that.\n\n0:11:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Is this going to be like the premium product?\n\n0:11:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Like how much does you know a remote control cost?\n\n0:11:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Well 25 euro.\n\n0:11:26\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean that's.\n\n0:11:27\tSPEAKER_03\n That's what like 18 pounds or something of a net.\n\n0:11:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Or is it as much as that?\n\n0:11:32\tSPEAKER_03\n 16, 17, 18 pounds.\n\n0:11:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:35\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:11:36\tSPEAKER_03\n I've never bought remote control.\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_03\n So I don't know how I get a remote control that would get you.\n\n0:11:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:42\tSPEAKER_03\n I suppose it has to look kind of cool gimmicky.\n\n0:11:48\tSPEAKER_03\n And.\n\n0:11:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:11:51\tSPEAKER_03\n You just scoot on the hood here.\n\n0:11:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:11:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, does anybody have anything to add to.\n\n0:11:59\tSPEAKER_03\n To the finance issue at all?\n\n0:12:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other.\n\n0:12:07\tSPEAKER_03\n No, actually that would be useful.\n\n0:12:09\tSPEAKER_03\n So I don't know if you knew like what your money would get you.\n\n0:12:12\tSPEAKER_03\n No.\n\n0:12:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:18\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:19\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:12:20\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Interesting thing about discussing production of remote control for me is that as you point out, I just don't think remote control is being something something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits.\n\n0:12:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:48\tSPEAKER_00\n It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something.\n\n0:12:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Just five minutes to end of meeting.\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, okay.\n\n0:12:55\tSPEAKER_03\n We're a bit behind.\n\n0:12:56\tSPEAKER_00\n You know what I mean?\n\n0:12:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:58\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, one way, looking at it would be well, the people producing television sets, maybe they have to buy remote controls.\n\n0:13:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Another way is maybe people who have TV sets are really fed up with their remote control.\n\n0:13:11\tSPEAKER_00\n And they really want a better one or something.\n\n0:13:14\tSPEAKER_02\n My parents want to buy more controls because they got fed up by having four or five different controls.\n\n0:13:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:13:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:13:21\tSPEAKER_02\n And the panel was just how many devices is a control.\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:13:25\tSPEAKER_00\n So, you know, the question one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses.\n\n0:13:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_03\n So, do you think that should be like a man designing a remote control?\n\n0:13:35\tSPEAKER_00\n I think so.\n\n0:13:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Do your satellite and your regular tally and your VCR and everything?\n\n0:13:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, like maybe what we could use as a sort of like an example of a successful other piece of technology is palm, palm pilots.\n\n0:13:48\tSPEAKER_00\n They're going from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras, MP3 players, telephones, everything agenda.\n\n0:13:56\tSPEAKER_00\n So like I wonder if we might add something new to the remote control market, such as the lighting in your house or.\n\n0:14:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Or even like you know, notes about what you want to watch, like you might put in there.\n\n0:14:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Or I want to watch that in touch and look at it.\n\n0:14:10\tSPEAKER_00\n And that's a good idea.\n\n0:14:11\tSPEAKER_00\n So extra functionality.\n\n0:14:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Like personally for me at home, I've I've combined the audio video of my television set and my DVD player and my CD player.\n\n0:14:22\tSPEAKER_00\n So they all work actually function together, but I have different remote controls for each of them.\n\n0:14:26\tSPEAKER_00\n So it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there.\n\n0:14:33\tSPEAKER_00\n You know, the sound and everything.\n\n0:14:35\tSPEAKER_00\n It's just one system, but each one's got its own little.\n\n0:14:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:14:45\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm going to have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes.\n\n0:14:49\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll just check with nothing else.\n\n0:14:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:14:53\tSPEAKER_03\n So anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used, what they would really like to be part of this new one.\n\n0:15:02\tSPEAKER_03\n It's all.\n\n0:15:03\tSPEAKER_01\n You keep losing them.\n\n0:15:04\tSPEAKER_03\n You keep losing them.\n\n0:15:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:15:07\tSPEAKER_01\n You get these ones where you can if you like whistle or make really high pitched noise they beep.\n\n0:15:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:20\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, is that something we'd want to include, you think?\n\n0:15:24\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm sure.\n\n0:15:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:15:27\tSPEAKER_00\n I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable.\n\n0:15:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Actually the cable between the TV and big like buttons that sort of like like on a blender or something.\n\n0:15:36\tSPEAKER_00\n I get no.\n\n0:15:37\tSPEAKER_00\n And you know, and I think about what they are now is better, but actually it's still kind of, I don't know, like a massive junky thing on the table.\n\n0:15:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Still put a plug in.\n\n0:15:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe we could think about how could be more, you know, streamlined.\n\n0:15:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe like a touch screen or something.\n\n0:15:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Something like that.\n\n0:15:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Or whatever would be technologically reasonable.\n\n0:15:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Uh-huh.\n\n0:15:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:15:58\tSPEAKER_00\n It could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better, but that just the appeal of not having, you know, these days, every, people things of people's homes are becoming more and more like chic, you know.\n\n0:16:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Um, nicer material than.\n\n0:16:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:16:13\tNone\n Might be.\n\n0:16:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:16:15\tSPEAKER_00\n The worth exploring.\n\n0:16:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:16:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, um, so we just to wrap up the next meeting is going to be in 30 minutes.\n\n0:16:21\tSPEAKER_03\n So that's about, um, about 10 to 12 by my watch.\n\n0:16:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Um, so in between nine then, um, as the industrial designer, you're going to be working on, you know, you're actually working design of it.\n\n0:16:34\tSPEAKER_03\n So you know, you're doing there.\n\n0:16:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Um, for our user interface technical functions, I guess that's, you know, like what we've been talking about, what it'll actually do.\n\n0:16:45\tSPEAKER_03\n And, um, marketing executive, you know, be just thinking about what it actually, what, you know, what requirements it has to, has to fulfill.\n\n0:16:56\tSPEAKER_03\n And we'll get instructions emailed to you, I guess.\n\n0:16:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:17:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Um, yeah.\n\n0:17:03\tSPEAKER_03\n So it's the functional design stage is next.\n\n0:17:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:17:11\tSPEAKER_03\n And, uh, in that sense, I got that little message.\n\n0:17:20\tSPEAKER_03\n I've seen it as my thought I would.\n\n0:17:27\tSPEAKER_00\n So before we wrap up just to make sure we're all on the same page here.\n\n0:17:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Um, do we, we're given sort of an example of a coffee machine.\n\n0:17:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:17:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, um, are we right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features, which go beyond the television,
