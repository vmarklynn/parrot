We can have a speech recommendation in the first place.\n\n0:07:49\tSPEAKER_03\n We just have the television, I want which channel.\n\n0:07:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, what?\n\n0:07:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Or we can say for example, recite all the proghtn9 instead of just remote control it is doing some searching for you so you don't have to look for the channel maybe I just want to press I want to have a button for all the movies tonight or a button for all the magazines all the information documentary tonight and then your list of view and I will choose from the list so instead of pressing the channel number \u00ed\u0083\u009c\n\n0:09:25\tSPEAKER_00\n TV eitself could have it. I could talk to the TV television itself.\n\n0:09:29\tSPEAKER_02\n I need not have any.\n\n0:09:31\tSPEAKER_02\n You are far from the TV.\n\n0:09:33\tSPEAKER_00\n We have some arrays or something.\n\n0:09:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Different technology.\n\n0:09:37\tSPEAKER_03\n The main idea I want to say is that there should be a function instead of choosing the TV channel there is an option you can choose either TV channels or the content of the program.\n\n0:09:51\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a good idea\n\n0:09:53\tSPEAKER_01\n but I think that technically it would be a little bit more tricky to achieve this.\n\n0:10:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Because you see now all the TV programs are available on the web.\n\n0:10:05\tSPEAKER_03\n They are available in the XML format or whatever format we don't care.\n\n0:10:11\tSPEAKER_03\n We just said that there is some content.\n\n0:10:13\tSPEAKER_03\n We just want to retrieve the content and then class it, sort them by the types of programs.\n\n0:10:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Some of the websites they already provide this service.\n\n0:10:21\tSPEAKER_03\n You can just use the service available.\n\n0:10:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Download it to this remote control.\n\n0:10:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Then there are only six buttons for six categories or the only seven buttons.\n\n0:10:33\tSPEAKER_03\n So you just choose the category one and you reuse the same button for example to choose among the sorted list the program you want.\n\n0:10:43\tSPEAKER_03\n You don't have to choose among 100 channels.\n\n0:10:47\tSPEAKER_03\n If you have 100 channels you just have six buttons, seven buttons.\n\n0:10:51\tSPEAKER_02\n We should also optimize the number of.\n\n0:10:55\tSPEAKER_01\n I think that just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to navigate through the...\n\n0:11:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh yes. So you launch?\n\n0:11:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Channel program or content.\n\n0:11:09\tSPEAKER_01\n So in an easy way.\n\n0:11:11\tSPEAKER_03\n So you don't have to display here.\n\n0:11:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Just display on the TV screen.\n\n0:11:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Good idea.\n\n0:11:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Which remote control we just navigate through the...\n\n0:11:21\tSPEAKER_03\n I think there will be revolutionary.\n\n0:11:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Because all the TV remote control we have are all numbers.\n\n0:11:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Lots of buttons.\n\n0:11:31\tSPEAKER_03\n And then you don't know what to choose.\n\n0:11:33\tSPEAKER_01\n The end.\n\n0:11:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah. So...\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_01\n I think for the technical points we have to check how to gather the data from the program or content and all these stuff.\n\n0:11:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay. So we have five minutes to...\n\n0:11:51\tSPEAKER_03\n We have sometimes to use the whiteboard.\n\n0:11:55\tSPEAKER_03\n You can use it five minutes.\n\n0:11:57\tSPEAKER_00\n And another interesting idea for this would be to have a light adaptation system depending upon the picture.\n\n0:12:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:12:05\tSPEAKER_00\n So if you are watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark...\n\n0:12:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Some dark scene.\n\n0:12:13\tSPEAKER_00\n So the lighting in the room changes.\n\n0:12:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah. But we are designing just remote control.\n\n0:12:17\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, you have an option in the remote control.\n\n0:12:19\tSPEAKER_00\n If you want to have that option you press that button in the remote control.\n\n0:12:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:12:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Do you want to have a concepture remote control there or you just want to put the function in?\n\n0:12:29\tSPEAKER_03\n If you want to...\n\n0:12:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Please no mind.\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Go and draw something right.\n\n0:12:35\tSPEAKER_00\n I am afraid you are forced to put your lapel.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Where is it?\n\n0:12:45\tSPEAKER_02\n The lapel.\n\n0:12:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Before the design let's assume what?\n\n0:12:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Where is it?\n\n0:12:51\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:53\tSPEAKER_00\n That one.\n\n0:12:55\tSPEAKER_02\n This one.\n\n0:12:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Before writing you can see that let's assume what we said.\n\n0:13:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:13:05\tSPEAKER_03\n So the most important function is to choose the content.\n\n0:13:13\tSPEAKER_03\n We agree on that.\n\n0:13:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:13:17\tSPEAKER_03\n The first one is to...\n\n0:13:23\tSPEAKER_03\n buttons.\n\n0:13:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Or you could be anything.\n\n0:13:27\tSPEAKER_03\n You could put buttons to choose...\n\n0:13:31\tSPEAKER_04\n uh...\n\n0:13:33\tSPEAKER_04\n content.\n\n0:13:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Or channels.\n\n0:13:39\tSPEAKER_03\n So we have both the user can choose...\n\n0:13:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Which one do you want?\n\n0:13:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, by content or by channel?\n\n0:13:45\tSPEAKER_03\n By content or by channel?\n\n0:13:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Choose by content or by channels?\n\n0:13:51\tSPEAKER_03\n So...\n\n0:13:53\tSPEAKER_03\n And then what did we say just now?\n\n0:13:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Other than this?\n\n0:13:59\tSPEAKER_01\n And we have to find a way how to gather information about the content.\n\n0:14:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:14:05\tSPEAKER_03\n So technically how the problems that...\n\n0:14:07\tSPEAKER_03\n how to do it is to...\n\n0:14:11\tSPEAKER_03\n how to get the content?\n\n0:14:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:15\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's not very difficult to...\n\n0:14:17\tSPEAKER_01\n to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by content.\n\n0:14:21\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:14:23\tSPEAKER_04\n Content.\n\n0:14:25\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:14:27\tSPEAKER_03\n So this we have to work it out.\n\n0:14:29\tSPEAKER_03\n So this one is a problem.\n\n0:14:31\tSPEAKER_03\n And...\n\n0:14:33\tSPEAKER_01\n I think that's the...\n\n0:14:35\tSPEAKER_01\n the main thing.\n\n0:14:37\tSPEAKER_01\n To reflect about it.\n\n0:14:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:14:41\tSPEAKER_03\n So we'll get some information in the next meeting.\n\n0:14:43\tSPEAKER_03\n So for now we get...\n\n0:14:45\tSPEAKER_03\n This is the functional designer spec.\n\n0:14:49\tSPEAKER_03\n That's the first aspect.\n\n0:14:51\tSPEAKER_04\n All right.\n\n0:14:53\tSPEAKER_04\n We'll get information and then we'll come back in...\n\n0:14:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:14:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Thank you everybody.\n\n0:15:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:03\tSPEAKER_02\n So maybe we'll meet in...\n\n0:15:05\tSPEAKER_02\n maybe five minutes.\n\n0:15:07\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:15:09\tSPEAKER_02\n We'll discuss the...\n\n0:15:11\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:15:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:15:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Thank you.\n\n0:15:17\tSPEAKER_02\n I think I'll become...\n\n0:15:47\tNone\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:15:49\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:15:51\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:15:53\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:15:55\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:15:57\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:15:59\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:16:01\tNone\n Okay.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "A new remote control should be original and trendy, but user user user is not branding.
