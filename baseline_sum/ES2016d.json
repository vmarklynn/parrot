the previous meeting and then we'll have a prototype presentation.\n\n0:00:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Then we will do an evaluation or we'll see what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation.\n\n0:00:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget.\n\n0:01:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Then we'll do the evaluation and then we can finish up after that with the changes that we'll need to make or hopefully everything will fall right in line.\n\n0:01:16\tSPEAKER_02\n The minutes from the last meeting, we looked at the trends.\n\n0:01:24\tSPEAKER_02\n We had the fashion trends that people want a fancy look and feel.\n\n0:01:28\tSPEAKER_02\n It was twice as important as anything else.\n\n0:01:32\tSPEAKER_02\n They liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles and a spongy feel.\n\n0:01:39\tSPEAKER_02\n So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype.\n\n0:01:45\tSPEAKER_02\n They wanted limited buttons and simplicity.\n\n0:01:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Then we looked at the method for coming up with our own remote, looking at other devices, the iPod.\n\n0:02:03\tSPEAKER_02\n We really liked to look at that.\n\n0:02:06\tSPEAKER_02\n We also had the kids remote for a simple idea, a two-part remote, which was what we originally looking at.\n\n0:02:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Then there was tacos.\n\n0:02:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Speech recognition becoming more predominant and easier to use.\n\n0:02:28\tSPEAKER_02\n But I think we still decided not to go with that.\n\n0:02:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Then we looked at the components, the materials for the case, the different energy sources, different types of chips and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote.\n\n0:02:46\tSPEAKER_02\n And basically, what we were making for the prototype.\n\n0:02:51\tSPEAKER_02\n So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over.\n\n0:02:58\tSPEAKER_04\n The prototype.\n\n0:02:59\tSPEAKER_04\n The prototype.\n\n0:03:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, do you need this?\n\n0:03:03\tSPEAKER_04\n No.\n\n0:03:04\tSPEAKER_04\n There you go.\n\n0:03:11\tSPEAKER_04\n Basically, we went with the colour yellow.\n\n0:03:16\tSPEAKER_04\n We were working on the principle of fruit, which was mentioned, it's basically designed around a banana.\n\n0:03:22\tSPEAKER_04\n But it would be held in such a fashion where it is, obviously, it wouldn't be that floppy because this would be hard plastic.\n\n0:03:29\tSPEAKER_04\n These would be like the rubber grips.\n\n0:03:31\tSPEAKER_04\n So that's how hopefully we grip the ergonomics of it.\n\n0:03:38\tSPEAKER_04\n But all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel.\n\n0:03:40\tSPEAKER_04\n To use your imagination, it's a bit.\n\n0:03:42\tSPEAKER_04\n And this here represents the screen where you'd go through.\n\n0:03:46\tSPEAKER_04\n And the simplest functions would be almost identical to an iPod, but that won't work through channels, that with other ethos, the volume would up and down.\n\n0:03:58\tSPEAKER_04\n And then to access the more complicated functions, you press that and go through the menus.\n\n0:04:03\tSPEAKER_04\n That's simple.\n\n0:04:04\tSPEAKER_04\n That's just representally infrared beam.\n\n0:04:08\tSPEAKER_04\n That's a simple analog switch.\n\n0:04:11\tSPEAKER_04\n I don't know.\n\n0:04:12\tSPEAKER_04\n We could use the voice.\n\n0:04:14\tSPEAKER_04\n That blue bits should be yellow.\n\n0:04:15\tSPEAKER_04\n That'd be where the vouchers would be, I suppose.\n\n0:04:18\tSPEAKER_04\n And that's about it.\n\n0:04:22\tSPEAKER_04\n This is simple.\n\n0:04:23\tSPEAKER_04\n We can make it.\n\n0:04:24\tSPEAKER_03\n We have a plastic covered with rubber.\n\n0:04:30\tSPEAKER_03\n We might add some more underneath here.\n\n0:04:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe give it a form.\n\n0:04:37\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm supposed to hold them like that, but just if you grab it.\n\n0:04:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that's my best.\n\n0:04:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Definitely she would.\n\n0:04:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, left handed over.\n\n0:04:45\tSPEAKER_03\n And they're supposed exactly, you know, you might as well.\n\n0:04:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I think that might be smaller.\n\n0:04:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Think about the buttons.\n\n0:04:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, either one on either side.\n\n0:04:58\tSPEAKER_02\n But not doing it all.\n\n0:04:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Just a quick one off button.\n\n0:05:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I think it's pretty important.\n\n0:05:05\tSPEAKER_03\n So you don't have to fiddle with that.\n\n0:05:07\tSPEAKER_03\n OK.\n\n0:05:09\tSPEAKER_03\n That's that.\n\n0:05:11\tSPEAKER_03\n I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice.\n\n0:05:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:14\tSPEAKER_03\n You're going to play with that over there.\n\n0:05:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:17\tSPEAKER_04\n Nice flimsy because it's straight up heavy.\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_04\n Right.\n\n0:05:20\tSPEAKER_04\n Just like that.\n\n0:05:21\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm happy.\n\n0:05:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Well done.\n\n0:05:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Kind of a banana.\n\n0:05:28\tSPEAKER_04\n No, whether or not it would fall to the cost of everything I suppose.\n\n0:05:32\tSPEAKER_04\n Would they scroll and they all say they?\n\n0:05:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, luckily we are going to find out.\n\n0:05:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Or not likely.\n\n0:05:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you have a marketing presentation for us?\n\n0:05:51\tSPEAKER_01\n OK.\n\n0:05:53\tSPEAKER_01\n You guys are going to help me do an evaluation of the criteria.\n\n0:06:21\tSPEAKER_01\n So first, I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier.\n\n0:06:30\tSPEAKER_01\n And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype.\n\n0:06:34\tSPEAKER_01\n And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did.\n\n0:06:38\tSPEAKER_01\n So the criteria we're going to be looking at are the complaints that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier.\n\n0:06:48\tSPEAKER_01\n So we're going to be doing it based on a 7 point scale.\n\n0:07:02\tSPEAKER_01\n And one is going to mean true that we did actually achieve that 7 being false we did not achieve that.\n\n0:07:21\tSPEAKER_01\n So for the first one, we need to decide did we solve the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote?\n\n0:07:32\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's definitely different than anything else out there.\n\n0:07:35\tSPEAKER_02\n So if they think that what is out there is ugly, then yes.\n\n0:07:39\tSPEAKER_02\n I would say most definitely.\n\n0:07:40\tSPEAKER_02\n It's bright.\n\n0:07:41\tSPEAKER_02\n It's bright.\n\n0:07:43\tSPEAKER_02\n It still has your traditional black.\n\n0:07:44\tSPEAKER_02\n It's curved.\n\n0:07:45\tSPEAKER_04\n It's no shop.\n\n0:07:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Angles to it.\n\n0:07:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Not angular.\n\n0:07:51\tSPEAKER_03\n I'd say it comes to the ergonomics of form and stuff.\n\n0:07:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, that's definitely more beautiful than your average.\n\n0:08:00\tSPEAKER_03\n However, the color.\n\n0:08:02\tSPEAKER_01\n I think color is the track to us.\n\n0:08:03\tSPEAKER_03\n So that has been dictated pretty much by the company.\n\n0:08:07\tSPEAKER_03\n So to answer that, honestly, I would rather say we have not solved the problem completely in the remote because the color is ugly.\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Definitely.\n\n0:08:19\tSPEAKER_03\n It's nothing you can say about that.\n\n0:08:21\tSPEAKER_03\n I much prefer something like brushed chrome.\n\n0:08:25\tSPEAKER_03\n That form.\n\n0:08:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, something more modern to go.\n\n0:08:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:08:29\tSPEAKER_02\n A modern color to go with the modern form.\n\n0:08:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:08:32\tSPEAKER_03\n It's different.\n\n0:08:32\tSPEAKER_03\n You don't want your three feet huge LCD display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with someone like that.\n\n0:08:46\tSPEAKER_01\n OK, so do you think since we, this wasn't a sign criteria, do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle of them?\n\n0:08:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Is that something good?\n\n0:08:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_01\n What do you think?\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Three, four.\n\n0:09:00\tSPEAKER_02\n I would say four.\n\n0:09:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Four is there.\n\n0:09:04\tSPEAKER_02\n OK.\n\n0:09:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Very non-committal for.\n\n0:09:07\tSPEAKER_01\n OK.\n\n0:09:08\tSPEAKER_01\n The second one, did we make it simple for new users?\n\n0:09:14\tSPEAKER_03\n It's very intuitive.\n\n0:09:15\tSPEAKER_03\n I think so.\n\n0:09:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:17\tSPEAKER_04\n So that was the main name.\n\n0:09:19\tSPEAKER_04\n My name is what we had.\n\n0:09:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Do the one.\n\n0:09:21\tSPEAKER_03\n One?\n\n0:09:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:22\tSPEAKER_01\n OK.\n\n0:09:25\tSPEAKER_01\n OK.\n\n0:09:27\tSPEAKER_01\n And do the controls now match the operating behavior of the users?\n\n0:09:32\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:33\tSPEAKER_04\n Because we've brought it down to basically four controls where they did the most common, which are channel and volume.\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_04\n And then the other one was just a massive, just going further.\n\n0:09:43\tSPEAKER_04\n Just scrolling further.\n\n0:09:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Just scrolling through and selecting.\n\n0:09:46\tSPEAKER_00\n So one.\n\n0:09:47\tSPEAKER_00\n So that's one.\n\n0:09:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:49\tSPEAKER_02\n I think that's one.\n\n0:09:50\tSPEAKER_02\n OK.\n\n0:09:51\tNone\n OK.\n\n0:09:57\tSPEAKER_01\n OK.\n\n0:09:58\tSPEAKER_01\n The fourth one, how about the problem of a remote being easily lost, one of the number ones?\n\n0:10:04\tSPEAKER_03\n I think that big and that yellow you just saw.\n\n0:10:07\tSPEAKER_03\n What did you like to do in the bright end?\n\n0:10:10\tSPEAKER_04\n But if we were to, if we were to, the speech recognition, we could maybe just use that solely for the finding thing.\n\n0:10:18\tSPEAKER_04\n That was what we would manage.\n\n0:10:19\tSPEAKER_02\n So if we incorporate speech recognition into it,\n\n0:10:22\tSPEAKER_04\n then just use to find it when it was lost. But like I said, I don't know.\n\n0:10:26\tSPEAKER_04\n You'd lose something and say, yellow, so easily.\n\n0:10:29\tSPEAKER_04\n And it's not going to fall like a rectangle, slip down behind things.\n\n0:10:32\tSPEAKER_04\n That's going to be a difficult shape to.\n\n0:10:35\tSPEAKER_02\n It is quite bright.\n\n0:10:37\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:38\tSPEAKER_04\n Maybe in the middle again, three or four.\n\n0:10:41\tSPEAKER_04\n I mean, losing things is one of those things that people can lose.\n\n0:10:45\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:46\tSPEAKER_04\n I mean, in a million ways, you can pick it up or walk away with it.\n\n0:10:47\tSPEAKER_04\n And then you lost it.\n\n0:10:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:49\tSPEAKER_02\n But if we do go with the speech recognition, then our scale goes up quite a bit.\n\n0:10:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:10:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Probably two.\n\n0:10:57\tSPEAKER_02\n If we eliminate the fact that it's impossible to guarantee that it's not going to be lost then.\n\n0:11:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's say two with speech recognition, which, of course, may be changed depending on budget.\n\n0:11:15\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:16\tSPEAKER_03\n You could add an extra feature, actually, which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from television.\n\n0:11:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:29\tSPEAKER_03\n We could add that, but that's nothing we have thought of, which\n\n0:11:33\tSPEAKER_02\n may be cheaper than speech recognition, if it were just a, yeah, true.\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_04\n But I mean, just as whistling clapping and screaming, you have that shape.\n\n0:11:41\tSPEAKER_04\n So I can't be that.\n\n0:11:43\tSPEAKER_03\n It's based on this anti-entie thousand sort of technology.\n\n0:11:46\tSPEAKER_03\n They are suitcases and stuff where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage, another piece that starts beeping that can't cost much.\n\n0:11:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:53\tSPEAKER_03\n So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to hide so you have one piece.\n\n0:11:59\tSPEAKER_03\n You have to glue somewhere behind your TV.\n\n0:12:01\tSPEAKER_02\n You stick it behind your TV and the other.\n\n0:12:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece.\n\n0:12:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:12:08\tSPEAKER_03\n That'd be tough, though.\n\n0:12:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, also your remote would alarm you if somebody stole your TV to your television.\n\n0:12:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:12:16\tSPEAKER_03\n And then you can run off to that without taking the beautiful remote control.\n\n0:12:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:19\tSPEAKER_01\n So are we adding one of these two features?\n\n0:12:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Let's add one of those features and say yes.\n\n0:12:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:12:28\tSPEAKER_01\n So we're going back to a one or two.\n\n0:12:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Two.\n\n0:12:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:12:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Are we technologically innovative?\n\n0:12:36\tSPEAKER_04\n I just want to show.\n\n0:12:40\tSPEAKER_04\n I don't get my name up.\n\n0:12:42\tSPEAKER_04\n I don't know what the controls was.\n\n0:12:45\tSPEAKER_04\n Just screened on.\n\n0:12:46\tSPEAKER_04\n It's all just stolen.\n\n0:12:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:48\tSPEAKER_02\n I thought it was.\n\n0:12:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:50\tSPEAKER_02\n But there's not a lot of yellow.\n\n0:12:51\tSPEAKER_02\n There's not a lot of yellow.\n\n0:12:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Of course, I wasn't really.\n\n0:12:53\tSPEAKER_02\n You're kind of forced to take that color.\n\n0:12:56\tNone\n Two.\n\n0:12:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:12:58\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know the way we are that innovative.\n\n0:13:01\tSPEAKER_01\n No, not true.\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_01\n But how many remote steers do you like this?\n\n0:13:06\tSPEAKER_02\n If we added the screaming factor.\n\n0:13:10\tSPEAKER_02\n And we go up.\n\n0:13:13\tSPEAKER_02\n I would say we're probably up for.\n\n0:13:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Really?\n\n0:13:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:13:18\tSPEAKER_01\n It's going to hurt us.\n\n0:13:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:13:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Spungy material.\n\n0:13:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, we have that.\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_01\n We have some splashes.\n\n0:13:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:26\tSPEAKER_03\n We have some splashes sort of made you.\n\n0:13:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_03\n It's not a one though.\n\n0:13:33\tSPEAKER_03\n One would be the whole thing.\n\n0:13:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Because it's only got to fold.\n\n0:13:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's a good thing.\n\n0:13:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:41\tSPEAKER_03\n And then we have some splashes.\n\n0:13:43\tSPEAKER_03\n These parts of the grips and perhaps the backside.\n\n0:13:46\tSPEAKER_02\n The bottom underneath on the back.\n\n0:13:49\tSPEAKER_01\n So that's a four.\n\n0:13:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Probably a four at most.\n\n0:13:52\tSPEAKER_01\n And lastly.\n\n0:13:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Did we put the fashion in electronics?\n\n0:13:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:13:57\tSPEAKER_02\n If your fashion is but is Carmen Miranda?\n\n0:13:59\tSPEAKER_02\n You betcha.\n\n0:14:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, the recent fashion has rather displayed in the LCD and the way you operate it.\n\n0:14:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, the form on the color, but it definitely is.\n\n0:14:09\tSPEAKER_03\n This is what we were told.\n\n0:14:10\tSPEAKER_04\n Let's say, definitely.\n\n0:14:12\tSPEAKER_04\n All right.\n\n0:14:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Now I just got a calculator.\n\n0:14:20\tSPEAKER_01\n 17, the baddest.\n\n0:14:27\tSPEAKER_01\n What's your baddest?\n\n0:14:29\tSPEAKER_04\n 17.\n\n0:14:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Seven is.\n\n0:14:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Two point.\n\n0:14:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Four.\n\n0:14:36\tNone\n Two point.\n\n0:14:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Four.\n\n0:14:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I've been done math.\n\n0:14:45\tSPEAKER_01\n What?\n\n0:14:48\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm sure you can't wait.\n\n0:14:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, we'll say 2.42.\n\n0:14:54\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:14:55\tSPEAKER_01\n How's that work?\n\n0:14:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Press, I can't do that without a calculator.\n\n0:15:03\tSPEAKER_03\n It's been a while.\n\n0:15:10\tSPEAKER_02\n And what is the acceptable criteria?\n\n0:15:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Is there like a scale that we have to hit?\n\n0:15:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, no.\n\n0:15:19\tSPEAKER_01\n It just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it?\n\n0:15:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Basically.\n\n0:15:27\tSPEAKER_02\n All right, then.\n\n0:15:30\tSPEAKER_01\n So that's that.\n\n0:15:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, well, let's see.\n\n0:15:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Now we get to do the budget numbers.\n\n0:15:42\tSPEAKER_02\n You didn't know that you were going to have a budget.\n\n0:15:47\tSPEAKER_02\n But we do.\n\n0:15:51\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:15:54\tSPEAKER_04\n It's been going a long time.\n\n0:15:57\tSPEAKER_04\n I'm not 2.42.\n\n0:16:00\tSPEAKER_01\n I said, you just keep skydiving.\n\n0:16:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:06\tSPEAKER_02\n So I have here 50%.\n\n0:16:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:10\tSPEAKER_02\n We want a 50% profit on this.\n\n0:16:14\tSPEAKER_02\n I can't really see that very well.\n\n0:16:16\tSPEAKER_02\n 12.5 euros is what's the cost.\n\n0:16:19\tSPEAKER_02\n So it's too much.\n\n0:16:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, let's see.\n\n0:16:25\tSPEAKER_02\n I like this.\n\n0:16:28\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:16:31\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:16:50\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:16:51\tSPEAKER_02\n So the top.\n\n0:16:52\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know if you guys can read that enough.\n\n0:16:54\tSPEAKER_02\n I can't sit on my glasses on.\n\n0:16:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:17:02\tSPEAKER_02\n So we've got the energy source.\n\n0:17:04\tSPEAKER_02\n There's a four five six categories.\n\n0:17:06\tSPEAKER_02\n We have energy source, electronics, case.\n\n0:17:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Then we have case material supplements, interface type.\n\n0:17:14\tSPEAKER_02\n And then button supplements.\n\n0:17:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:17:18\tSPEAKER_02\n So first of all, energy source.\n\n0:17:21\tSPEAKER_02\n We pick battery.\n\n0:17:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Probably some either two or four.\n\n0:17:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Two.\n\n0:17:28\tNone\n Two.\n\n0:17:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Like it.\n\n0:17:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Four is going to be too heavy.\n\n0:17:34\tSPEAKER_03\n So that's not our problem.\n\n0:17:36\tSPEAKER_03\n People can change it every month.\n\n0:17:40\tSPEAKER_03\n They won't go on.\n\n0:17:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Excellent.\n\n0:17:42\tSPEAKER_02\n They bought it.\n\n0:17:44\tSPEAKER_02\n This is consumerism.\n\n0:17:46\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:17:47\tSPEAKER_02\n So for the electronics, our choices are simple chip on print, regular chip on print, advanced chip on print, sample sensor, sample speaker.\n\n0:17:57\tSPEAKER_03\n That's the advanced chip on print.\n\n0:18:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:18:01\tSPEAKER_02\n We have one of those.\n\n0:18:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:18:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Then the case is a probably it's double curved.\n\n0:18:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:18:17\tSPEAKER_02\n So the case materials are plastic, plastic.\n\n0:18:23\tSPEAKER_02\n I guess it's two since one for the top one for the bottom.\n\n0:18:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Is that right or is it just one?\n\n0:18:29\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:18:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe it's one because of the single mode.\n\n0:18:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:18:35\tSPEAKER_02\n I guess it doesn't matter because the price on that one is zero.\n\n0:18:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Special color.\n\n0:18:43\tSPEAKER_03\n That's not a special color.\n\n0:18:45\tSPEAKER_02\n The ugly color.\n\n0:18:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Interface type.\n\n0:18:50\tSPEAKER_02\n We have push buttons, scroll wheel interface, integrated scroll wheel push button, LCD display.\n\n0:18:58\tSPEAKER_02\n So we actually have the LCD display.\n\n0:19:03\tSPEAKER_04\n And then is it the integrated or?\n\n0:19:06\tSPEAKER_04\n Yes.\n\n0:19:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:19:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Button supplements.\n\n0:19:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Special color.\n\n0:19:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Special form.\n\n0:19:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Special material.\n\n0:19:18\tSPEAKER_03\n We could of course make the buttons wood.\n\n0:19:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Same.\n\n0:19:23\tSPEAKER_01\n How can they?\n\n0:19:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Really love that?\n\n0:19:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Or titanium.\n\n0:19:27\tSPEAKER_01\n The cost is all the same.\n\n0:19:29\tSPEAKER_02\n But we only have one button.\n\n0:19:31\tSPEAKER_02\n So really we shouldn't be sure.\n\n0:19:33\tSPEAKER_02\n We shouldn't be sure.\n\n0:19:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Anything.\n\n0:19:35\tSPEAKER_02\n The button supplements.\n\n0:19:38\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:39\tSPEAKER_04\n I think no.\n\n0:19:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:19:41\tSPEAKER_02\n We're going to leave that one blank because we run on LCD and scroll.\n\n0:19:46\tSPEAKER_02\n So our total is 15.5.\n\n0:19:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Which I believe is by three euros over.\n\n0:20:01\tSPEAKER_03\n So we go for the hand dynamo.\n\n0:20:07\tSPEAKER_02\n So the only thing better than if a Nana's shape remote is one that you shake.\n\n0:20:12\tSPEAKER_04\n What if we complete and took out the one single button we've got on and just had a scroll wheel interface.\n\n0:20:19\tSPEAKER_04\n And the LCD display.\n\n0:20:21\tSPEAKER_04\n I suppose the LCD display is the one that's putting out.\n\n0:20:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, because we have to have both, right?\n\n0:20:32\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:33\tSPEAKER_03\n And that's that's face it also depends on the software on the television.\n\n0:20:38\tSPEAKER_03\n You can have the information of this.\n\n0:20:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Display on the screen.\n\n0:20:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, you could maybe take out the LCD display.\n\n0:20:49\tSPEAKER_04\n Even if it comes up on the computer itself on TV itself.\n\n0:20:54\tSPEAKER_02\n So we may not need the LCD display.\n\n0:20:57\tSPEAKER_04\n Not as possible.\n\n0:20:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:21:00\tSPEAKER_03\n There you go.\n\n0:21:05\tSPEAKER_03\n There we go.\n\n0:21:06\tSPEAKER_02\n 12.5.\n\n0:21:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:21:11\tSPEAKER_02\n So we just remove our screen screen here.\n\n0:21:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Big a dial.\n\n0:21:17\tSPEAKER_04\n Easy to use.\n\n0:21:18\tSPEAKER_04\n Even easy to use.\n\n0:21:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Besides, look at what the LCD does to our lovely remote.\n\n0:21:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:21:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Back to the design room, boys.\n\n0:21:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Take away.\n\n0:21:33\tSPEAKER_03\n There you go.\n\n0:21:37\tSPEAKER_01\n What's the blue part?\n\n0:21:39\tSPEAKER_00\n That was just we got out of yellow.\n\n0:21:44\tSPEAKER_04\n There you go.\n\n0:21:45\tSPEAKER_04\n There you go.\n\n0:21:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Even simpler.\n\n0:21:48\tSPEAKER_04\n Looks more like a banana.\n\n0:21:51\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:21:57\tSPEAKER_02\n So costs under 12.5 euro.\n\n0:21:59\tSPEAKER_02\n There's no.\n\n0:22:00\tSPEAKER_02\n We redesigned it.\n\n0:22:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Now it's yes.\n\n0:22:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Next slide.\n\n0:22:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Project evaluation.\n\n0:22:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Project process satisfaction with, for example, room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, means, new ideas found.\n\n0:22:18\tSPEAKER_02\n So I guess that, let's see.\n\n0:22:28\tSPEAKER_02\n I think that perhaps the project evaluation is just supposed to be completed by me.\n\n0:22:47\tSPEAKER_02\n But I'd like to hear your thoughts.\n\n0:22:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Kind of fill in some time.\n\n0:23:02\tSPEAKER_02\n What did you think of our project process?\n\n0:23:08\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, I think we don't quite well.\n\n0:23:11\tSPEAKER_04\n We started off a little week.\n\n0:23:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning.\n\n0:23:25\tSPEAKER_02\n But as the day went along, we had more idea of what we were doing.\n\n0:23:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Room for creativity.\n\n0:23:36\tSPEAKER_02\n There was that.\n\n0:23:41\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we tried a lot of different things.\n\n0:23:43\tSPEAKER_02\n And I think it was interesting as you guys brought up more information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things.\n\n0:23:54\tSPEAKER_02\n You guys worked together.\n\n0:23:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, as a team.\n\n0:23:57\tSPEAKER_02\n And the means.\n\n0:24:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Which was the whiteboard and the pens.\n\n0:24:03\tSPEAKER_02\n I had some problem with the pen.\n\n0:24:06\tSPEAKER_01\n I think my power point.\n\n0:24:09\tSPEAKER_01\n No, I know.\n\n0:24:10\tSPEAKER_03\n People I work for.\n\n0:24:15\tSPEAKER_02\n I have a list of employees that you would like fired.\n\n0:24:21\tSPEAKER_02\n New ideas found.\n\n0:24:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, for the remote, maybe no, not for technology.\n\n0:24:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Closing, cost are within the budget.\n\n0:24:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Project is evaluated.\n\n0:24:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Complete final questionnaire and meeting someone.\n\n0:24:47\tSPEAKER_02\n That's it.\n\n0:24:50\tSPEAKER_02\n I still have to do my minutes.\n\n0:24:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Actually.\n\n0:25:02\tSPEAKER_02\n So there will probably be another questionnaire coming up.\n\n0:25:09\tSPEAKER_02\n And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can.\n\n0:25:13\tSPEAKER_02\n What goes on after that.\n\n0:25:15\tSPEAKER_02\n That's the end of our meeting.\n\n0:25:22\tNone\n Nancy.\n\n0:25:28\tNone\n Tyler.\n\n0:25:43\tNone\n Jeff.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "This is the last meeting
