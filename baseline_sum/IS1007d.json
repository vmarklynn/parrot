{"filename": "./data/IS1007d.txt", "transcript": "0:00:30\tNone\n Hanna, Hanna, Hanna, Hanna, Hanna, Last meeting we have discussed the concept of design and we ask you to prepare a prototype for the multi-controll.\n\n0:01:02\tSPEAKER_02\n I'd be in.\n\n0:01:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, so let's see what.\n\n0:01:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, so can you go to the shed folder?\n\n0:01:16\tSPEAKER_01\n The shed folder.\n\n0:01:18\tSPEAKER_02\n The folder presentation.\n\n0:01:20\tSPEAKER_01\n We have a presentation because I have a presentation.\n\n0:01:26\tSPEAKER_01\n The pumpkin.\n\n0:01:32\tSPEAKER_01\n So I got a participant three, three.\n\n0:01:42\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a final design.\n\n0:01:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:01:50\tSPEAKER_01\n So I discussed with you.\n\n0:01:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:01:56\tSPEAKER_01\n So we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototype.\n\n0:02:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Because we were not decided whether we wanted to have an LCD or not.\n\n0:02:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Because it's too expensive.\n\n0:02:10\tSPEAKER_01\n So we come out with two versions.\n\n0:02:12\tSPEAKER_01\n One weave and one with our LCDs.\n\n0:02:16\tSPEAKER_01\n But both comes with a charger.\n\n0:02:19\tSPEAKER_01\n And then detachable or unparalleled control module.\n\n0:02:25\tSPEAKER_01\n And detachable big buttons for all people.\n\n0:02:31\tSPEAKER_01\n So.\n\n0:02:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, so I'll show you two prototypes.\n\n0:02:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Here are the first one with the beautiful LCD and display.\n\n0:02:45\tSPEAKER_03\n And you can just browse into the navigation menu by a joystick-like button.\n\n0:02:55\tSPEAKER_03\n You can choose the direction.\n\n0:02:57\tSPEAKER_03\n And if you just push on it, it's considered like an Enter function.\n\n0:03:03\tSPEAKER_03\n You have on the side here the microphone for the speech recognition system here.\n\n0:03:13\tSPEAKER_03\n And you switch that control.\n\n0:03:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Why you put it in the side?\n\n0:03:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I think it's not a good AS movie to do that.\n\n0:03:25\tSPEAKER_01\n No, it's all around the microphone.\n\n0:03:29\tSPEAKER_01\n The microphone picks up the speech from the microphone.\n\n0:03:33\tSPEAKER_04\n Is it only a single microphone or microphone?\n\n0:03:35\tSPEAKER_03\n So it's a microphone array.\n\n0:03:37\tSPEAKER_02\n It's very costly.\n\n0:03:39\tSPEAKER_02\n It's just a single microphone.\n\n0:03:43\tSPEAKER_03\n I think we put it here because I think when you are browsing your LCD, you will be close to, well, it's better to place it here, for instance.\n\n0:03:57\tSPEAKER_03\n And here is a little switch that control if you want the speaker recognition system to be on or off.\n\n0:04:07\tSPEAKER_03\n And so this remote control comes up with its Charger.\n\n0:04:13\tSPEAKER_03\n How much does it cost this one?\n\n0:04:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, this prototype is made for about 15 dollars.\n\n0:04:23\tSPEAKER_03\n 15 dollars.\n\n0:04:25\tSPEAKER_03\n But it's not a division.\n\n0:04:29\tSPEAKER_03\n But it's just a prototype.\n\n0:04:31\tSPEAKER_03\n And if we optimize the...\n\n0:04:35\tSPEAKER_04\n The cost will be less.\n\n0:04:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, the production costs.\n\n0:04:39\tSPEAKER_03\n We can achieve about 10 dollars.\n\n0:04:43\tSPEAKER_02\n How many?\n\n0:04:45\tSPEAKER_03\n How many, excuse me, party?\n\n0:04:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, a battery.\n\n0:04:49\tSPEAKER_03\n We use about...\n\n0:04:51\tSPEAKER_01\n The two AA batteries, isn't it?\n\n0:04:53\tSPEAKER_01\n AA rechargeable batteries.\n\n0:04:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Rechargeable, of course.\n\n0:04:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Of course, because we have the charger.\n\n0:04:59\tSPEAKER_01\n We have the charger, so it's no problem.\n\n0:05:01\tSPEAKER_02\n And you just say, one battery?\n\n0:05:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, one battery.\n\n0:05:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Is it two or one?\n\n0:05:07\tSPEAKER_04\n It's kitty tick.\n\n0:05:09\tSPEAKER_02\n It's actually...\n\n0:05:11\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a flexible thing.\n\n0:05:13\tSPEAKER_01\n No, it's a voltage rating for that.\n\n0:05:17\tSPEAKER_04\n The voltage rating.\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_04\n What type of battery?\n\n0:05:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, yeah, it's just a simple battery.\n\n0:05:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Rechargeable.\n\n0:05:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:27\tSPEAKER_04\n If you...\n\n0:05:29\tSPEAKER_04\n Something like two, a three size battery.\n\n0:05:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:33\tSPEAKER_03\n So, and if you want to charge the battery, you just put the remote control like that.\n\n0:05:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Plug in the charger and leave it alone.\n\n0:05:43\tSPEAKER_03\n It's all right.\n\n0:05:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Then the next time you pick it, Oh.\n\n0:05:49\tSPEAKER_01\n It works.\n\n0:05:51\tSPEAKER_01\n I forgot to tell you, there is only a single button there.\n\n0:05:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, just explain the button.\n\n0:05:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, all right.\n\n0:05:57\tSPEAKER_01\n This button is like a mouse.\n\n0:05:59\tSPEAKER_01\n You can move in 360 degrees of direction.\n\n0:06:01\tSPEAKER_01\n So, you can make a turn.\n\n0:06:03\tSPEAKER_01\n And it...\n\n0:06:05\tSPEAKER_01\n The functions associated to all the actions you make.\n\n0:06:07\tSPEAKER_01\n You have a click.\n\n0:06:09\tSPEAKER_01\n You have a double click.\n\n0:06:11\tSPEAKER_01\n All in a single button.\n\n0:06:13\tSPEAKER_01\n You can move up, down, left, right.\n\n0:06:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Or you can do a swing.\n\n0:06:17\tSPEAKER_01\n So, a swing to the left or swing to the right.\n\n0:06:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Defines other functions.\n\n0:06:21\tSPEAKER_01\n So, even though it's a single button, but it's pretty flexible because of the 360 degree movement.\n\n0:06:27\tSPEAKER_04\n On the LCD is this one.\n\n0:06:29\tSPEAKER_04\n On the remote.\n\n0:06:31\tSPEAKER_01\n This is the version that comes with LCD.\n\n0:06:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Here present another version,\n\n0:06:35\tSPEAKER_02\n the body else. I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months of function is button getting destroyed.\n\n0:06:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh.\n\n0:06:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay. This is new prototype.\n\n0:06:49\tSPEAKER_03\n So, we have the second version also with a different button configuration.\n\n0:06:55\tSPEAKER_03\n The second version is also simpler.\n\n0:06:57\tSPEAKER_03\n We just have to put the microphone.\n\n0:07:01\tSPEAKER_03\n So, basically, it's the same switch.\n\n0:07:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Basically, it's the same things I've presented before.\n\n0:07:13\tSPEAKER_03\n But here we have four buttons for navigation.\n\n0:07:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Plus one button acting as an enter button.\n\n0:07:21\tSPEAKER_03\n So, according to what you said, it's more robust to the user.\n\n0:07:27\tSPEAKER_03\n And it's also cheaper to produce.\n\n0:07:31\tSPEAKER_03\n We can produce a set remote control for about four other hours.\n\n0:07:35\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know.\n\n0:07:37\tSPEAKER_04\n It's easy.\n\n0:07:39\tSPEAKER_04\n Good.\n\n0:07:41\tSPEAKER_04\n And I think you forgot the point here to have a button to find the charger.\n\n0:07:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, no.\n\n0:07:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Because there's a measure.\n\n0:07:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:51\tSPEAKER_04\n Speed-chognition system.\n\n0:07:53\tSPEAKER_04\n And if you disable speed-chognition system then...\n\n0:07:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I will come to that point later.\n\n0:07:57\tSPEAKER_03\n So, Norman will explain to you.\n\n0:08:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe we'll set the charger with this.\n\n0:08:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Of course.\n\n0:08:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Either the charger, in either versions, they use the same charger.\n\n0:08:13\tSPEAKER_02\n So, the price of the charger included in the...\n\n0:08:17\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a standard module.\n\n0:08:19\tSPEAKER_01\n So, you should get for a cheap price.\n\n0:08:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Thank you.\n\n0:08:23\tSPEAKER_01\n It's the same charger that you can use for the handphone.\n\n0:08:29\tSPEAKER_01\n But again, it depends on the types.\n\n0:08:33\tSPEAKER_01\n I think we have to investigate more on that.\n\n0:08:35\tSPEAKER_02\n The price should be below 12 and 12.\n\n0:08:39\tSPEAKER_01\n But as the marketing manager says, people are willing to pay more for good design.\n\n0:08:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, people are willing to pay more.\n\n0:08:47\tSPEAKER_04\n But the company is not willing to invest more.\n\n0:08:51\tSPEAKER_02\n The price of selling is 25 euros.\n\n0:08:55\tSPEAKER_02\n And the price of...\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Alright, so, go on Norman with the special features.\n\n0:09:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, come out to that.\n\n0:09:03\tSPEAKER_01\n The thing that makes the controller cheap is that it is modular.\n\n0:09:07\tSPEAKER_01\n So, you want more functions, you pay more.\n\n0:09:09\tSPEAKER_01\n If you want less functions, if you want a reasonable price, you can put it back in or you can use the other one.\n\n0:09:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Or...\n\n0:09:17\tSPEAKER_01\n The special connection is the wisdom microphone.\n\n0:09:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:09:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Then the microphone is put in.\n\n0:09:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Then you have a special connection.\n\n0:09:25\tSPEAKER_01\n You pay less for the system.\n\n0:09:27\tSPEAKER_01\n You see.\n\n0:09:29\tSPEAKER_01\n You see.\n\n0:09:31\tSPEAKER_01\n You see.\n\n0:09:33\tSPEAKER_01\n You see.\n\n0:09:35\tSPEAKER_01\n You see.\n\n0:09:37\tSPEAKER_01\n You see.\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_01\n You see.\n\n0:09:41\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:09:45\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:09:47\tSPEAKER_01\n It's pretty flexible in the...\n\n0:09:49\tSPEAKER_03\n You also have the two other modules for the parental control.\n\n0:09:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:09:55\tSPEAKER_03\n You can head up to your remote control.\n\n0:10:01\tSPEAKER_03\n If you want to have more power on what you do.\n\n0:10:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:07\tSPEAKER_03\n And with channel you want to choose, and so on.\n\n0:10:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Here is just the module for the kids.\n\n0:10:13\tSPEAKER_03\n And if the parents want to watch TV, they come up with their modules, they just plug in it.\n\n0:10:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:21\tSPEAKER_03\n And they can have all the control they want here.\n\n0:10:23\tSPEAKER_03\n We also have this module for old people.\n\n0:10:27\tSPEAKER_03\n With big buttons, clearly labeled, and it acts like the previous one.\n\n0:10:33\tSPEAKER_03\n You just plug in and it works.\n\n0:10:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:39\tSPEAKER_01\n The idea, the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful.\n\n0:10:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Simplicity, meaning that we have few buttons.\n\n0:10:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Powerful is that all the controls, the one you saw, we saw earlier in the meetings.\n\n0:10:57\tSPEAKER_01\n With lots of buttons.\n\n0:10:59\tSPEAKER_01\n But here you only have few buttons, but you retain them.\n\n0:11:03\tSPEAKER_01\n The same powerful functionalities.\n\n0:11:05\tSPEAKER_01\n And then you have the same condition with simplicity.\n\n0:11:09\tSPEAKER_01\n So that's the best idea.\n\n0:11:11\tSPEAKER_01\n The concept, that's our innovation in this design here.\n\n0:11:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, now we come to other important features that I did not tell you.\n\n0:11:23\tSPEAKER_01\n The first one is the speech synchronizer.\n\n0:11:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Again, it's detachable or add-on.\n\n0:11:27\tSPEAKER_01\n And then we also have security features.\n\n0:11:29\tSPEAKER_01\n For example, this year.\n\n0:11:31\tSPEAKER_01\n It's very robust, but it doesn't break.\n\n0:11:35\tSPEAKER_01\n The material one was the material.\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_01\n It's titanium.\n\n0:11:39\tSPEAKER_01\n It's very...\n\n0:11:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Again, either battery life is an durable one.\n\n0:11:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Again, because it's AA batteries, you can choose the types of batteries you want.\n\n0:11:49\tSPEAKER_01\n You can replace the cheaper one.\n\n0:11:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Again, you pay for what you get.\n\n0:11:55\tSPEAKER_01\n And then the other point is robust.\n\n0:11:59\tSPEAKER_01\n And then you have a replacement reminder.\n\n0:12:01\tSPEAKER_01\n So when you finish watching your TV and you turn off the TV, and then there's a message coming out that please put that back to the charger.\n\n0:12:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:12:15\tSPEAKER_01\n So that's the reminder part.\n\n0:12:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:21\tSPEAKER_01\n And they also use a programmable channel and vocabulary.\n\n0:12:27\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's up to the user to define.\n\n0:12:29\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:12:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Sorry.\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_01\n And then because of the children that are using the device, we have also a pre-filter of TV programs by John.\n\n0:12:45\tSPEAKER_01\n And this can be used by the adult or by the children.\n\n0:12:49\tSPEAKER_01\n So instead of choosing the channel, you are choosing the TV contents of the night.\n\n0:12:55\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's pretty powerful.\n\n0:12:57\tSPEAKER_01\n And that's why the not buttons are reduced because of this feature.\n\n0:13:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:03\tSPEAKER_01\n And for the materials that is cheap to produce, I think it's quite clear from...\n\n0:13:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:13:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:11\tSPEAKER_01\n And also like the wet and the fancy designs.\n\n0:13:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe you can improve more the design.\n\n0:13:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe.\n\n0:13:19\tSPEAKER_02\n What's the price to produce?\n\n0:13:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, so the price to produce.\n\n0:13:23\tSPEAKER_03\n For the simplest one, we start from four dollars to produce such a device.\n\n0:13:31\tSPEAKER_03\n It's about...\n\n0:13:33\tSPEAKER_02\n It's about...\n\n0:13:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Without the charger.\n\n0:13:37\tSPEAKER_03\n It's about, well, two dollars to produce the microphone and speech recognition systems.\n\n0:13:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Two dollars for the...\n\n0:13:45\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:13:47\tSPEAKER_03\n And finally, three dollars for the charger.\n\n0:13:51\tSPEAKER_03\n So if you sum up everything, we don't have to...\n\n0:13:57\tSPEAKER_03\n With the LCD.\n\n0:13:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Which costs two dollars.\n\n0:14:01\tSPEAKER_03\n You have two plus four plus four plus two plus two.\n\n0:14:05\tSPEAKER_04\n I think we use the Excel.\n\n0:14:07\tSPEAKER_04\n We don't have only...\n\n0:14:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:14:11\tSPEAKER_02\n So the total cost,\n\n0:14:13\tSPEAKER_03\n if you want all the functionalities, will be about 15 dollars.\n\n0:14:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:21\tSPEAKER_03\n But it's just if you want all functionalities.\n\n0:14:23\tSPEAKER_02\n It's just if you want all functionalities.\n\n0:14:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Excuse me?\n\n0:14:29\tSPEAKER_04\n It's below the pre-pitch.\n\n0:14:31\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, it's a nice inputs.\n\n0:14:33\tSPEAKER_04\n But we have an...\n\n0:14:35\tSPEAKER_04\n Other inputs from the public demands.\n\n0:14:37\tSPEAKER_04\n I think we would just have a rough look.\n\n0:14:39\tSPEAKER_04\n And then we can make our statements.\n\n0:14:41\tSPEAKER_04\n And we can finalize the product based on this.\n\n0:14:45\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:47\tSPEAKER_04\n So we can find out how we could come to some final conclusions.\n\n0:14:53\tSPEAKER_04\n So the marketing made an evaluation criteria.\n\n0:14:57\tNone\n And this was some of the findings.\n\n0:15:01\tNone\n And in the market, we have a lot of information.\n\n0:15:07\tSPEAKER_04\n And we have a lot of information.\n\n0:15:11\tSPEAKER_04\n And we have a lot of information.\n\n0:15:13\tSPEAKER_04\n And in the market, the people are not really interested with LCD, without LCD, with speech recognition, interface, or without speech recognition, interface.\n\n0:15:31\tSPEAKER_04\n But most of the people, what they are interested is, first thing is, they want to have a fancy look and feel.\n\n0:15:39\tSPEAKER_04\n It should be very fancy with colorful technologies.\n\n0:15:43\tSPEAKER_04\n It should be much more technologically innovative.\n\n0:15:45\tSPEAKER_04\n Of course, in that, we could put LCD or recognition to be more technologically innovative.\n\n0:15:53\tSPEAKER_04\n And the third one is easy to use.\n\n0:15:55\tSPEAKER_03\n And I think that the technical innovation is in the product itself, since we haven't yet remodeled, who are Halloween to choose, and interactively with the TV screen, with just four buttons.\n\n0:16:13\tSPEAKER_04\n And if you go to the next slide, here you can find, these are the latest version of the Dets.\n\n0:16:19\tSPEAKER_04\n And so this, and Paris and Milan, they are the detector, these trends, that this year, it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable.\n\n0:16:31\tSPEAKER_04\n So people are really interested to see if they haven't remodeled in the shape of the fruit or vegetable or whatever they like.\n\n0:16:39\tSPEAKER_04\n So I think it should be much more customized to make a different shapes.\n\n0:16:47\tSPEAKER_04\n And the second thing is, and if the material, they really do not want it to be very hard, as in the case of very plastic-caught titanium, it should be somewhat spongy.\n\n0:16:59\tSPEAKER_01\n But then the problem is that is it robust to mishandling?\n\n0:17:05\tSPEAKER_01\n We should find a material that is robust, at the same time spongy.\n\n0:17:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, spongy.\n\n0:17:13\tSPEAKER_04\n So finally we have these three criterias.\n\n0:17:17\tSPEAKER_04\n One is fancy look.\n\n0:17:19\tSPEAKER_04\n Second is, innovative.\n\n0:17:25\tSPEAKER_04\n And third is, easy to use.\n\n0:17:29\tNone\n So these are the three criteria, on which we are going to build our remod.\n\n0:17:37\tSPEAKER_04\n And we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these.\n\n0:17:43\tSPEAKER_04\n Say that, we have a seven point scale, from one to seven.\n\n0:17:49\tSPEAKER_04\n And for each of the product, you could just give me the scale, according to this.\n\n0:17:55\tSPEAKER_04\n So in our case, we have a width LCD and without LCD.\n\n0:18:01\tSPEAKER_04\n So on this scale, if it is true, if it is, if it has a fancy look, you could just tell me one.\n\n0:18:11\tSPEAKER_04\n Or if it is false, it doesn't look much fancy, then you could just tell me seven.\n\n0:18:17\tSPEAKER_04\n So we can make our study on this.\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_01\n So is evaluation depending on Earth, other users?\n\n0:18:27\tSPEAKER_04\n No, no, we have, you are designed two products now.\n\n0:18:29\tSPEAKER_04\n One is with LCD and without LCD.\n\n0:18:31\tSPEAKER_01\n But who will give the scoring a, we ourselves or, you, or the party.\n\n0:18:37\tSPEAKER_04\n No, according to you, designers, how you feel, does it with LCD and without LCD?\n\n0:18:45\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, let us make this L and without LCD.\n\n0:18:51\tSPEAKER_04\n On this scale, we have a LCD remote control.\n\n0:18:55\tSPEAKER_04\n How does it look?\n\n0:18:57\tSPEAKER_04\n Is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy?\n\n0:19:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, it doesn't look much fancy.\n\n0:19:03\tSPEAKER_03\n I will say three or four.\n\n0:19:05\tSPEAKER_04\n And you both agree for that?\n\n0:19:09\tSPEAKER_01\n I think we can improve on the design.\n\n0:19:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, somewhere, comment that this is like the stone edge of the design.\n\n0:19:21\tSPEAKER_01\n So we have been focused all this time on the technical aspect, functional aspect.\n\n0:19:29\tSPEAKER_01\n But also the simplicity.\n\n0:19:31\tSPEAKER_01\n As for the design, maybe we should hire a designer to do.\n\n0:19:33\tSPEAKER_04\n So I take three on the LCD.\n\n0:19:35\tSPEAKER_04\n So without LCD, how would you rate it?\n\n0:19:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Four.\n\n0:19:41\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it's more easy to make fancy things when it's not complicated.\n\n0:19:47\tSPEAKER_03\n So removing the LCD gives us more liberty to\n\n0:19:53\tSPEAKER_04\n have a fancy look. And in the sense of innovativeness with LCD?\n\n0:19:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, it's the same for both.\n\n0:20:01\tSPEAKER_03\n So I will give five, six.\n\n0:20:05\tSPEAKER_04\n Five with LCD and\n\n0:20:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, five also Norman, please.\n\n0:20:11\tSPEAKER_01\n From the innovation aspect, I feel that what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototype that we saw in the last meeting is that the retrieval of TV programs by content.\n\n0:20:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Because that is really innovative.\n\n0:20:35\tSPEAKER_01\n And for now, another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity.\n\n0:20:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Few buttons with a lot of functionalities.\n\n0:20:47\tSPEAKER_01\n So without LCD?\n\n0:20:49\tSPEAKER_01\n For both, I have a thing that our product has the best in all.\n\n0:20:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, this is a bias and judgment.\n\n0:21:01\tSPEAKER_04\n No, no. According to design aspect, we want to know how do you feel innovativeness?\n\n0:21:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Innovation is very high.\n\n0:21:07\tSPEAKER_04\n With LCD.\n\n0:21:09\tSPEAKER_03\n And without LCD?\n\n0:21:11\tSPEAKER_03\n For both.\n\n0:21:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Innovation is the same innovation.\n\n0:21:14\tSPEAKER_01\n So maybe you can put six.\n\n0:21:16\tSPEAKER_03\n No, six.\n\n0:21:18\tSPEAKER_04\n Let's go with four things.\n\n0:21:20\tSPEAKER_04\n Both.\n\n0:21:22\tSPEAKER_04\n No, actually to make it with LCD, you make more efforts.\n\n0:21:26\tSPEAKER_04\n So either is high innovativeness included if you make it with LCD.\n\n0:21:30\tSPEAKER_04\n Then when it is without LCD, there is not much innovativeness.\n\n0:21:34\tSPEAKER_01\n So I can't go.\n\n0:21:36\tSPEAKER_01\n There was an issue here is that what is display on LCD?\n\n0:21:40\tSPEAKER_01\n We haven't really I mean, that's what you are saying.\n\n0:21:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Actually, it's good to have an LCD, but what are we going to display on an LCD?\n\n0:21:48\tSPEAKER_01\n No, it's like this.\n\n0:21:50\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, on the LCD,\n\n0:21:52\tSPEAKER_04\n according to what I understand from your model is, you have a joystick here.\n\n0:21:56\tSPEAKER_04\n And you have an LCD.\n\n0:21:58\tSPEAKER_04\n You just press your joystick.\n\n0:22:00\tSPEAKER_04\n You get here a program.\n\n0:22:02\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, but then the same program on the TV screen.\n\n0:22:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:22:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Exactly.\n\n0:22:10\tSPEAKER_04\n No, on the TV, it doesn't display on the TV now.\n\n0:22:12\tSPEAKER_04\n If you have the LCD.\n\n0:22:14\tSPEAKER_04\n LCD, then there is no meaning in having on the TV.\n\n0:22:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Or then again, you have a channels, volume, and all this stuff.\n\n0:22:20\tSPEAKER_04\n But you can display all on an LCD.\n\n0:22:22\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, that depends upon your design.\n\n0:22:24\tSPEAKER_04\n So.\n\n0:22:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Anyway, for the users who opt for LCD, we will give them the LCD.\n\n0:22:34\tSPEAKER_01\n We will give them the LCD.\n\n0:22:36\tSPEAKER_01\n We give them the customer ones, right?\n\n0:22:40\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:42\tSPEAKER_04\n So without LCD, you want to put it the same level of innovativeness.\n\n0:22:48\tSPEAKER_04\n And which word do you recommend?\n\n0:22:50\tSPEAKER_04\n Is it to use with LCD or without LCD?\n\n0:22:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, I think both are really easy to use because there are a few buttons.\n\n0:23:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, the menu are clear, well-organized.\n\n0:23:08\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:23:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, with little knowing of the technology, you can easily use the product.\n\n0:23:16\tSPEAKER_03\n So I would give a six for the user to use.\n\n0:23:18\tSPEAKER_01\n I think.\n\n0:23:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Sorry.\n\n0:23:22\tSPEAKER_02\n No, it's just if I see the the rate, I think it's better to do it without LCD.\n\n0:23:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Because as with LCD, just we increase the price.\n\n0:23:38\tSPEAKER_02\n They have the same rates of without LCD.\n\n0:23:40\tSPEAKER_04\n Or we can just go back to the previous slide where we have a few updates.\n\n0:23:48\tSPEAKER_04\n So, I mean, in the product design, you could just amend it to make some future changes according to the fruit on the stable or a spongey touch.\n\n0:23:56\tSPEAKER_04\n Without LCD and without speech recognition, even then our product is going to be very good.\n\n0:24:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Very good to produce.\n\n0:24:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:06\tSPEAKER_03\n And if we have less technology, we are more liberty to follow the shape and things like that.\n\n0:24:12\tSPEAKER_01\n I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect.\n\n0:24:16\tSPEAKER_01\n I think the easy to use aspect is different for different people.\n\n0:24:22\tSPEAKER_01\n For the young generation, easy to use may be very complicated because there are a lot of controls with lots of buttons.\n\n0:24:30\tSPEAKER_01\n For kids, they want simplicity, the city is similar for the office, for the office, for the office.\n\n0:24:36\tSPEAKER_01\n So that's why with the parental module, we can have a bit more complex design if they want it.\n\n0:24:44\tSPEAKER_01\n But what I'm trying to say here is that we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of buttons.\n\n0:24:50\tSPEAKER_01\n So in terms of easy to use, I think it's very user customizable.\n\n0:24:56\tSPEAKER_01\n User customization is very important.\n\n0:25:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:02\tSPEAKER_01\n So without LCD,\n\n0:25:06\tSPEAKER_04\n I just take it 5 or you want the 26. I think it's the same.\n\n0:25:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, as you say, we'd better...\n\n0:25:16\tSPEAKER_03\n We'd better...\n\n0:25:20\tSPEAKER_04\n I think it's better to have this without LCD.\n\n0:25:24\tSPEAKER_03\n And to improve the...\n\n0:25:26\tSPEAKER_04\n As our project manager says that without LCD, it is going to reduce the cost also, and it's going to be much simpler to use.\n\n0:25:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, simply to use Morne Berthi to have a fancy look.\n\n0:25:38\tSPEAKER_03\n So let's go back to our laboratory.\n\n0:25:42\tSPEAKER_02\n So what do you prefer to buy this special permission?\n\n0:25:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Huh?\n\n0:25:48\tSPEAKER_02\n And you want to buy the integration of...\n\n0:25:50\tSPEAKER_01\n The special permission is an on-module.\n\n0:25:52\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, that's going to be an optional.\n\n0:25:54\tSPEAKER_04\n If someone wants to buy it, they can have it otherwise.\n\n0:25:58\tSPEAKER_03\n It's an optional option.\n\n0:26:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Since, well, according to this study, people are more...\n\n0:26:06\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's more the first ponji here.\n\n0:26:08\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm more controlled.\n\n0:26:10\tSPEAKER_02\n It would be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control.\n\n0:26:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Because maybe parents...\n\n0:26:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, if you have an add-ons,\n\n0:26:18\tSPEAKER_04\n the kids may just hide the parental module and so that the parents can't do it.\n\n0:26:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Parents take care of the kids, forget where they put it on.\n\n0:26:30\tSPEAKER_02\n So maybe better if you have all these in the same...\n\n0:26:32\tSPEAKER_02\n In the same set.\n\n0:26:34\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:36\tSPEAKER_04\n And individual buttons to make them work.\n\n0:26:38\tSPEAKER_01\n The problem is if a customer wants a certain component and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children.\n\n0:26:48\tSPEAKER_01\n When you sell the product in the market, you could meet any kind of people.\n\n0:26:52\tSPEAKER_01\n And not all people will need all the functionalities you propose to them.\n\n0:26:57\tSPEAKER_01\n So we might lose the customer because of this.\n\n0:27:00\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know, what do you think?\n\n0:27:02\tSPEAKER_02\n So you mean that even if this module is supposed to be...\n\n0:27:04\tSPEAKER_02\n It would be functional?\n\n0:27:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:27:07\tSPEAKER_01\n But what do you think? I don't know.\n\n0:27:09\tSPEAKER_04\n I have to make a marketing survey that how many married couples or how many couples have a TV or to the number of singles who have a television.\n\n0:27:21\tSPEAKER_04\n So based on that, I think...\n\n0:27:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:25\tSPEAKER_01\n But the question is, does those modularity increase the production cause or decrease the production cause?\n\n0:27:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, it's about the same.\n\n0:27:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Because if...\n\n0:27:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, you can...\n\n0:27:37\tSPEAKER_03\n If you add something like...\n\n0:27:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, no.\n\n0:27:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Because if you add something like...\n\n0:27:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, maybe because it's three different pieces to build a bit.\n\n0:27:51\tSPEAKER_04\n But you can make it on a single piece with three different options.\n\n0:27:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:57\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it's cheaper if you...\n\n0:28:01\tSPEAKER_03\n You already built the old functionalities on the same module.\n\n0:28:07\tSPEAKER_03\n But on the same piece of it.\n\n0:28:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, the other aspect is that when they have the existing product, you're going to maintain the...\n\n0:28:17\tSPEAKER_01\n You're going to keep the same customer because the same customer will come back\n\n0:28:21\tSPEAKER_04\n to buy other add-ons. Yeah, that's right.\n\n0:28:25\tSPEAKER_01\n How many could you just provide with an optional service?\n\n0:28:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, if so, if you don't buy it now, it's a future.\n\n0:28:31\tSPEAKER_01\n So, in that way, you're actually keeping the same customer attracting them to come back and again and again.\n\n0:28:37\tSPEAKER_04\n So, it's something like a Microsoft product.\n\n0:28:41\tSPEAKER_04\n I'm trying to follow the Microsoft.\n\n0:28:43\tSPEAKER_02\n We don't want that.\n\n0:28:45\tSPEAKER_01\n And we don't want to...\n\n0:28:47\tSPEAKER_04\n Updates and we sell it.\n\n0:28:49\tSPEAKER_04\n We make updates and sell it on this.\n\n0:28:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, if the buyers can be upgraded, it can be a good thing.\n\n0:28:55\tSPEAKER_01\n They had to depends on the production.\n\n0:28:57\tSPEAKER_04\n And that was the idea about the shape of the remote controls.\n\n0:29:03\tNone\n Well, so...\n\n0:29:03\tSPEAKER_04\n And they've been made into a fruit and vegetable types.\n\n0:29:07\tSPEAKER_03\n They require different types of PCBs.\n\n0:29:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but, well, the components, we'll have to change because we have to deal with the shape.\n\n0:29:17\tSPEAKER_03\n But I don't think it will increase the cost much.\n\n0:29:21\tSPEAKER_04\n Or it could be like this.\n\n0:29:23\tSPEAKER_04\n The PCB would be the same for all, but only the exterior shape is different for all.\n\n0:29:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, but it's a bit complicated to...\n\n0:29:31\tSPEAKER_03\n If you need machines to...\n\n0:29:35\tSPEAKER_03\n different machines to...\n\n0:29:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, well...\n\n0:29:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we can change this to propose the customers with skins.\n\n0:29:43\tSPEAKER_01\n For example, the mobile phones nowadays...\n\n0:29:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:29:47\tSPEAKER_01\n They sell different kinds of skins.\n\n0:29:49\tSPEAKER_01\n And then people just feel that,\n\n0:29:51\tSPEAKER_03\n oh, I have a new skin and it looks better. And then it's a double shape.\n\n0:29:55\tSPEAKER_03\n And then...\n\n0:29:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:59\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know the skins.\n\n0:30:01\tSPEAKER_01\n And with this spongy texture, things like that.\n\n0:30:05\tSPEAKER_04\n You can fly in one material that being...\n\n0:30:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Sponging.\n\n0:30:09\tNone\n Sponging.\n\n0:30:09\tSPEAKER_01\n You need to look into the material.\n\n0:30:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, a flurry,\n\n0:30:13\tSPEAKER_03\n like a pet dog kind of thing. Yeah.\n\n0:30:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:30:19\tSPEAKER_03\n So, we finished the prototype presentation, if you have something else to say.\n\n0:30:25\tSPEAKER_04\n I think the product manager would be interested to look about the financial issues and make me these models.\n\n0:30:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Project evaluation project.\n\n0:30:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Project selection.\n\n0:30:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Project selection.\n\n0:30:43\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know, we have to ask this question.\n\n0:30:45\tSPEAKER_02\n We have to give an answer.\n\n0:30:47\tSPEAKER_02\n It's over.\n\n0:30:49\tSPEAKER_01\n I suppose if you let this criteria, is it?\n\n0:30:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Project evaluation.\n\n0:30:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Project evaluation.\n\n0:30:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's pause.\n\n0:30:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Room for creativity.\n\n0:30:59\tSPEAKER_01\n This room is a bit small, but...\n\n0:31:01\tSPEAKER_01\n But I think it's okay for us to work with.\n\n0:31:05\tSPEAKER_01\n I feel it's fine.\n\n0:31:07\tSPEAKER_04\n We don't...\n\n0:31:09\tSPEAKER_04\n I think it's okay.\n\n0:31:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:13\tSPEAKER_04\n It's fine for making a presentation.\n\n0:31:15\tSPEAKER_04\n For project presentations.\n\n0:31:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Anyway, we have the laboratory nearby to do our modules.\n\n0:31:23\tSPEAKER_04\n It's okay.\n\n0:31:25\tSPEAKER_04\n And the leadership was excellent.\n\n0:31:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:29\tSPEAKER_02\n I think so.\n\n0:31:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Good job.\n\n0:31:33\tSPEAKER_02\n We gave you the liberty to talk.\n\n0:31:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n0:31:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n0:31:39\tSPEAKER_02\n The teamwork was very, very good.\n\n0:31:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Very democratic.\n\n0:31:43\tSPEAKER_02\n I am very satisfied to work with.\n\n0:31:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Thank you, Abbas.\n\n0:31:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Thank you, Mom.\n\n0:31:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Honestly.\n\n0:31:53\tSPEAKER_03\n All right.\n\n0:31:55\tSPEAKER_04\n New ideas, and new ideas to make this presentation more interactive and more interesting.\n\n0:32:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Come up with new products.\n\n0:32:07\tSPEAKER_04\n What type of product should you think could we make this\n\n0:32:11\tSPEAKER_02\n more interesting?\n\n0:32:13\tSPEAKER_01\n I know something. We need more cakes, more biscuits on the table.\n\n0:32:17\tSPEAKER_01\n We have meetings.\n\n0:32:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:21\tSPEAKER_03\n And also more...\n\n0:32:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, more seriously, I think it's...\n\n0:32:25\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a good idea to have clear...\n\n0:32:29\tSPEAKER_03\n clear points.\n\n0:32:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Whenever we do a meeting, pre-out the meeting, to have a...\n\n0:32:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, at least with the points we'll be discussed on things like that.\n\n0:32:43\tSPEAKER_03\n But I think it's all right.\n\n0:32:45\tSPEAKER_03\n We achieved project goal.\n\n0:32:49\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, that is within the budget.\n\n0:32:51\tSPEAKER_04\n And the value is...\n\n0:32:53\tSPEAKER_02\n More or less without...\n\n0:32:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Without special permission.\n\n0:32:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but we seem to...\n\n0:32:59\tSPEAKER_04\n All right.\n\n0:33:01\tSPEAKER_04\n And the next is celebration.\n\n0:33:03\tSPEAKER_03\n So, coffee machine.\n\n0:33:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:07\tSPEAKER_01\n All right, then we finished.\n\n0:33:09\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah. Thank you very much.\n\n0:33:11\tSPEAKER_02\n All right, then.\n\n0:33:37\tNone\n I'm not going to go any in with that money.\n\n0:33:47\tNone\n All right.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "Hanna, Hanna, Hanna and Speecher are discussing the design of the multi-controll.
