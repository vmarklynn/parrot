Okay.\n\n0:00:08\tSPEAKER_03\n We'll see you.\n\n0:00:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:00:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Hello.\n\n0:00:12\tSPEAKER_00\n I do.\n\n0:00:13\tSPEAKER_00\n So what were you guys discussing?\n\n0:00:16\tSPEAKER_00\n No, it's just, I was a few good manage.\n\n0:00:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:00:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Did you find anything new?\n\n0:00:23\tSPEAKER_03\n No, nothing special.\n\n0:00:25\tSPEAKER_03\n I have a lot of work for the...\n\n0:00:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Great.\n\n0:00:30\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm having a lot of fun with you.\n\n0:00:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Hey, everything alright?\n\n0:00:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Just a little bit of time.\n\n0:00:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:00:41\tSPEAKER_01\n I hope it's something we can work with.\n\n0:00:44\tSPEAKER_03\n I have the same.\n\n0:00:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Do you have a lot of film information?\n\n0:00:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you have a lot of new information?\n\n0:00:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I heard that there was a new component, speech recognition component, which was...\n\n0:00:59\tSPEAKER_01\n That's true.\n\n0:01:00\tSPEAKER_01\n We were up to standard, so we might use that.\n\n0:01:02\tSPEAKER_01\n I put that in my drawing, but again, I did not have that much time, so...\n\n0:01:07\tSPEAKER_02\n I have a lot of film.\n\n0:01:09\tSPEAKER_02\n I've made a complete list of...\n\n0:01:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Everything that we can use.\n\n0:01:13\tSPEAKER_02\n All the components that are available.\n\n0:01:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, that's just super.\n\n0:01:16\tSPEAKER_02\n I still don't have any finance information, but these will have a lot more to go on now.\n\n0:01:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, if I'm just too bad.\n\n0:01:22\tSPEAKER_01\n You need to...\n\n0:01:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I have to start it first.\n\n0:01:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:01:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, we'll go again.\n\n0:01:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, second phase, conceptual design.\n\n0:01:33\tSPEAKER_00\n It's fine.\n\n0:01:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Everybody knows what we're talking about, so...\n\n0:01:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:01:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Take you past a minute, so the last meeting again.\n\n0:01:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Again, you get your three-present date to see what you came up with.\n\n0:01:42\tSPEAKER_00\n So, too bad we don't have any finance information, apparently.\n\n0:01:45\tSPEAKER_00\n So, it's too bad.\n\n0:01:47\tSPEAKER_00\n So, then we'll just have to go on the information that we have to make the...\n\n0:01:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Make final decision on a conceptual design.\n\n0:01:54\tSPEAKER_00\n There we go.\n\n0:01:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Anyway, last...\n\n0:01:57\tSPEAKER_00\n We'll discuss the last time.\n\n0:01:58\tSPEAKER_00\n You'll remember that.\n\n0:01:59\tSPEAKER_00\n We have to keep the electronics size in mind.\n\n0:02:02\tSPEAKER_00\n So, it goes for you.\n\n0:02:04\tSPEAKER_00\n We have to have an easy design with big buttons, which are durable.\n\n0:02:07\tSPEAKER_00\n And there are people actually willing to spend money to do...\n\n0:02:10\tSPEAKER_00\n To get more features.\n\n0:02:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Among those features, LCD screen, our voice recognition are very popular.\n\n0:02:15\tSPEAKER_00\n So, we have to make a move on that area, I guess.\n\n0:02:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Especially when the new component is applicable in our product will be fine.\n\n0:02:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Anyways, well, DeltaX wasn't important.\n\n0:02:28\tSPEAKER_00\n And that's what I took.\n\n0:02:30\tSPEAKER_00\n The consumer, yeah, we aim for young consumers, so that's fine.\n\n0:02:33\tSPEAKER_00\n And, well, actually...\n\n0:02:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we did need some more data on finances, but we still don't have that apparently.\n\n0:02:40\tSPEAKER_00\n That's too bad.\n\n0:02:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we need to...\n\n0:02:43\tSPEAKER_00\n We are going to implement the beep and the flash thing to recover your remote.\n\n0:02:46\tSPEAKER_00\n So, while these interchangeable covers are apparently, which will make it a more fashionable product.\n\n0:02:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Going decisions anyway.\n\n0:02:55\tSPEAKER_00\n This will have to do this after the...\n\n0:02:57\tSPEAKER_00\n After you give your presentation, so just close this one now.\n\n0:03:01\tSPEAKER_00\n And let's...\n\n0:03:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's see.\n\n0:03:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Where's the nerdy?\n\n0:03:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Where's the lot to tell?\n\n0:03:06\tSPEAKER_00\n You had a lot to go on, so let you go first.\n\n0:03:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:03:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:03:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's see, my...\n\n0:03:16\tSPEAKER_02\n The presentation is...\n\n0:03:19\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:03:23\tSPEAKER_02\n This, I mentioned before, every feature of our remote control needs to have their own operating and electronic devices.\n\n0:03:31\tSPEAKER_02\n We need to take care of that.\n\n0:03:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Then, warning, there has to be a chip in our remote control.\n\n0:03:36\tSPEAKER_02\n And the chip requirements needed for a normal button is just a simple chip.\n\n0:03:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Scroll wheel, regular, and LCD is an advanced.\n\n0:03:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Of course, this is more expensive than this.\n\n0:03:46\tSPEAKER_02\n So, we have to decide on that in a minute.\n\n0:03:49\tSPEAKER_02\n The available components for energy are...\n\n0:03:52\tSPEAKER_02\n We have a basic battery, a hand-in-dynamo, like in old torches.\n\n0:03:57\tSPEAKER_02\n We have a kinetic provision.\n\n0:04:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Then, you have to shake your remote control to get energy.\n\n0:04:03\tSPEAKER_02\n And we have solar cells.\n\n0:04:05\tSPEAKER_02\n I suggest that we decide on that one immediately.\n\n0:04:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Then, I have all lists.\n\n0:04:09\tSPEAKER_02\n So, my personal favorite is the kinetic provision, because...\n\n0:04:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Is it a provider enough energy?\n\n0:04:16\tSPEAKER_00\n I think so.\n\n0:04:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:04:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Also, if we were to choose the LCD option, Yes.\n\n0:04:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Would you give it a turn here?\n\n0:04:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:04:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Because I have information.\n\n0:04:25\tSPEAKER_02\n You take the remote control, you pick it up at least two times a day.\n\n0:04:28\tSPEAKER_02\n So, then it's already shaken and gives longer.\n\n0:04:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Sure, if it's shaken enough.\n\n0:04:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Because I don't really see people shaking their remote control.\n\n0:04:35\tSPEAKER_00\n No, I don't think so, because watches can go on kinetic energy, because they move all the time.\n\n0:04:38\tSPEAKER_00\n But I'm sure...\n\n0:04:39\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, remote's lies still, I think, like 99% of the time.\n\n0:04:43\tSPEAKER_00\n So, I don't think that's a...\n\n0:04:45\tSPEAKER_00\n The other turns were solar cells, and I don't think that's applicable.\n\n0:04:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Other options are solar cells, hand-in-dynamo, and basic battery.\n\n0:04:52\tSPEAKER_02\n I think...\n\n0:04:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Why shouldn't we take a basic battery?\n\n0:04:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Rechargeable, maybe.\n\n0:04:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Only a basic battery.\n\n0:04:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, but I think everybody knows how to use that.\n\n0:04:59\tSPEAKER_00\n It's common.\n\n0:05:00\tSPEAKER_00\n And it's available everywhere, so why should...\n\n0:05:03\tSPEAKER_02\n But I think this rules out our rechargeable units.\n\n0:05:06\tSPEAKER_02\n This is really a basic battery.\n\n0:05:08\tSPEAKER_00\n A really basic battery.\n\n0:05:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Normal battery.\n\n0:05:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it wasn't in the options of rechargeable module wash.\n\n0:05:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, that's noted now.\n\n0:05:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, of course you could place rechargeable batteries, but that's up to the consumer itself.\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, but then we don't offer rechargements function.\n\n0:05:22\tSPEAKER_02\n That's what it's...\n\n0:05:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, it's not in the list, so we can choose from it.\n\n0:05:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Exactly.\n\n0:05:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, it's like other batteries.\n\n0:05:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Next one is curving.\n\n0:05:30\tSPEAKER_02\n We can make a model that has one curve, two or three.\n\n0:05:34\tSPEAKER_02\n And...\n\n0:05:35\tSPEAKER_02\n There's being...\n\n0:05:36\tSPEAKER_02\n The shape.\n\n0:05:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Of course, the more...\n\n0:05:38\tSPEAKER_02\n The more expensive.\n\n0:05:39\tSPEAKER_01\n The more expensive.\n\n0:05:40\tSPEAKER_01\n The more control itself.\n\n0:05:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:05:42\tSPEAKER_01\n I was thinking along the line of one curve, I'll show that in my design.\n\n0:05:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, we'll get back to that later.\n\n0:05:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I think one curve is...\n\n0:05:50\tSPEAKER_00\n But what are the implications of using some of the more curves?\n\n0:05:52\tSPEAKER_00\n It gets more expensive.\n\n0:05:54\tSPEAKER_00\n More expensive.\n\n0:05:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so I think with the actually that we had there, it's two curves, I suppose.\n\n0:05:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:06:00\tSPEAKER_02\n And I believe even that the number of options we have on putting things in it goes down to decreases.\n\n0:06:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:06:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Exactly.\n\n0:06:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Material.\n\n0:06:09\tSPEAKER_02\n I have to offer a plastic rubber wood or titanium.\n\n0:06:13\tSPEAKER_02\n If we choose plastic, we cannot choose solar cells for energy.\n\n0:06:17\tSPEAKER_02\n If we choose titanium, we cannot use more than one curve.\n\n0:06:21\tSPEAKER_02\n But we don't have any...\n\n0:06:22\tSPEAKER_00\n One curve, I have.\n\n0:06:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, I'd go for plastic because I have a couple of curves in my design.\n\n0:06:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Let's get back to it.\n\n0:06:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, we have...\n\n0:06:32\tSPEAKER_00\n So I think we can rule out...\n\n0:06:34\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not sure we can do anything.\n\n0:06:36\tSPEAKER_00\n I will do that when you get your design.\n\n0:06:38\tSPEAKER_02\n But I think wood is not an option either.\n\n0:06:39\tSPEAKER_00\n No, wood is not an option.\n\n0:06:40\tSPEAKER_00\n No, it's stylish.\n\n0:06:41\tSPEAKER_00\n You can change the covers anyway.\n\n0:06:44\tSPEAKER_02\n My personal thought was, Robert, because I had an email, I believe it was from you.\n\n0:06:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, keeping my control.\n\n0:06:50\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a follow-up control.\n\n0:06:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Followed a lot in the ground, so you don't want it to break.\n\n0:06:55\tSPEAKER_00\n So you either have rubber edges or a rubber rule control, it's very durable.\n\n0:07:00\tSPEAKER_01\n It doesn't have to be unbreakable because we...\n\n0:07:02\tSPEAKER_01\n You don't have to be unbreakable.\n\n0:07:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Do you need to keep selling these things?\n\n0:07:04\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not supposed to...\n\n0:07:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, break after one use.\n\n0:07:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, well that...\n\n0:07:09\tSPEAKER_00\n They follow a lot.\n\n0:07:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Definitely true.\n\n0:07:11\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we have to decide in this anyway.\n\n0:07:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Because if you make removable covers, it has to be one of those materials.\n\n0:07:16\tSPEAKER_02\n We have no more than this.\n\n0:07:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we'll rubber actually protect the remote control itself.\n\n0:07:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, yeah, for example, if you take hard plastic, if it falls at my crack, and rubber kind of...\n\n0:07:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but then you buy a new cover.\n\n0:07:30\tSPEAKER_01\n But...\n\n0:07:31\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not sure if it's the entire cover you change.\n\n0:07:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Are we focusing very much on the covers now?\n\n0:07:37\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's just...\n\n0:07:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Now we're going for the basic design.\n\n0:07:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Everyone, I expand our options, be fashionable, then we can get changeable covers.\n\n0:07:44\tSPEAKER_00\n But I think the basic thing...\n\n0:07:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's just rule out wood for now and continue.\n\n0:07:49\tSPEAKER_03\n But are we focusing on the younger people or the elder people?\n\n0:07:54\tSPEAKER_00\n We're definitely focusing on the younger people.\n\n0:07:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Because that was our main goal.\n\n0:07:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Then...\n\n0:07:58\tSPEAKER_02\n I proceed, but I need to know after this meeting.\n\n0:08:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, okay, we go.\n\n0:08:03\tSPEAKER_02\n In the face, I have four things to offer.\n\n0:08:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Normal push buttons, of course.\n\n0:08:07\tSPEAKER_02\n We have a lot of expertise on that one.\n\n0:08:10\tSPEAKER_02\n We have a large history, our company, on push buttons.\n\n0:08:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Scroll wheels, those can be pushed as well, although that is more expensive.\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Liquid crystal, color display.\n\n0:08:20\tSPEAKER_02\n And...\n\n0:08:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, and if we use rubber, I already mentioned that we can only use rubber buttons.\n\n0:08:27\tSPEAKER_02\n So rubber can only match with rubber.\n\n0:08:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Which one of those are we going to use?\n\n0:08:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Push buttons, that's...\n\n0:08:33\tSPEAKER_00\n I think...\n\n0:08:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, of course we're going to use...\n\n0:08:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I did go on the thought of a scroll wheel, actually.\n\n0:08:38\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm still deciding on what could you use it for?\n\n0:08:41\tSPEAKER_00\n I think the channel...\n\n0:08:43\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that would be annoying, because it might accidentally scroll on to another channel.\n\n0:08:47\tSPEAKER_00\n I think a push button for channel would be better.\n\n0:08:49\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, for a volume control, it's a smoother motion.\n\n0:08:52\tSPEAKER_00\n You can just increase or decrease.\n\n0:08:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Is it really necessary?\n\n0:08:56\tSPEAKER_01\n No, thanks a lot.\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_03\n I haven't taken it to consideration.\n\n0:08:59\tSPEAKER_03\n The younger people need one.\n\n0:09:01\tSPEAKER_03\n My investigation turns out that the younger people want a little bit of material that is...\n\n0:09:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Flashy, yeah.\n\n0:09:08\tSPEAKER_02\n I think so.\n\n0:09:09\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not that much.\n\n0:09:11\tSPEAKER_02\n If we take a normal scroll wheel without pushing, then it's not expensive.\n\n0:09:14\tSPEAKER_02\n We can do that.\n\n0:09:15\tSPEAKER_02\n But why would we use it?\n\n0:09:16\tSPEAKER_02\n We don't need it.\n\n0:09:17\tSPEAKER_00\n If it's not a wide-putting...\n\n0:09:19\tSPEAKER_00\n If it's not something people are looking for or it's useful, I think they are looking for it.\n\n0:09:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Of course we have a young target group, so they might find that...\n\n0:09:28\tSPEAKER_02\n It's cruel.\n\n0:09:29\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not useful.\n\n0:09:30\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't think it gives an extra function to the robot anyway.\n\n0:09:34\tSPEAKER_02\n So push buttons, we will use LCD screen.\n\n0:09:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Perhaps...\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_00\n You get on the LCD screen.\n\n0:09:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Is it expensive?\n\n0:09:42\tSPEAKER_02\n I only know that if we are using that we need an advanced chip in it.\n\n0:09:48\tSPEAKER_02\n And that is small.\n\n0:09:49\tSPEAKER_00\n And how much more expensive is that?\n\n0:09:50\tSPEAKER_00\n I have no idea.\n\n0:09:51\tSPEAKER_00\n I have no absolute numbers.\n\n0:09:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Absolutely.\n\n0:09:53\tSPEAKER_00\n But it just more expensive and takes more room, I suppose.\n\n0:09:57\tSPEAKER_02\n But I don't think the room is really an issue.\n\n0:09:59\tSPEAKER_00\n No, thanks an issue.\n\n0:10:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:10:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's go for it.\n\n0:10:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Because it is very hot in our target group, I think we should take into consideration to build an LCD screen in it.\n\n0:10:09\tSPEAKER_01\n I have two designs, one including an LCD screen, which is basically the deluxe edition.\n\n0:10:16\tSPEAKER_01\n And then I also have a standard edition, which we can also choose to do.\n\n0:10:20\tSPEAKER_01\n We can also choose to do that.\n\n0:10:21\tSPEAKER_00\n We can basically have the same functionality but lacks the LCD screen.\n\n0:10:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Exactly.\n\n0:10:25\tSPEAKER_00\n We'll pick from that.\n\n0:10:27\tSPEAKER_00\n We'll just combine everything later.\n\n0:10:29\tSPEAKER_02\n The first one is the chip, that is no longer an option, it has to be an advanced one now.\n\n0:10:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Because we have an infrared sender, I think that is basic.\n\n0:10:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Basically it.\n\n0:10:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Otherwise it is not a remote control.\n\n0:10:42\tSPEAKER_02\n And we have the sample sensor and speaker, the voice recognition thing.\n\n0:10:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Are we going to do that?\n\n0:10:46\tSPEAKER_02\n What else?\n\n0:10:47\tSPEAKER_00\n I would ask you if it is expensive but apparently you don't have any data.\n\n0:10:50\tSPEAKER_02\n I only have a relative...\n\n0:10:53\tSPEAKER_00\n What was the exact one you got on the new computer?\n\n0:10:56\tSPEAKER_01\n I got the new computer that is relatively small.\n\n0:10:59\tSPEAKER_00\n So we can implement it.\n\n0:11:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes, so why if it is small and we can't...\n\n0:11:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Why shouldn't we?\n\n0:11:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:04\tSPEAKER_00\n And there is...\n\n0:11:05\tSPEAKER_00\n That goes over my own world.\n\n0:11:06\tSPEAKER_00\n What was the last number of how many people were interested in voice recognition?\n\n0:11:11\tSPEAKER_00\n I thought it was hard for different countries of course.\n\n0:11:14\tSPEAKER_00\n The most of them.\n\n0:11:15\tSPEAKER_00\n You had to program it yourself, I suppose.\n\n0:11:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Their own voice.\n\n0:11:19\tSPEAKER_03\n More than 60%.\n\n0:11:23\tSPEAKER_00\n More than 60% of the people would like a recognition.\n\n0:11:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Mino for 70% I think.\n\n0:11:28\tSPEAKER_03\n I have to look it up.\n\n0:11:29\tSPEAKER_00\n If it is small, if it fits, if people like it, why not?\n\n0:11:32\tSPEAKER_02\n But don't we have any information about the scroll wheel?\n\n0:11:35\tSPEAKER_02\n If people would like that.\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_02\n No, of course that is the same story.\n\n0:11:39\tSPEAKER_02\n It is not necessary.\n\n0:11:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Like an LCD, but it adds something to the...\n\n0:11:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we got some data on people that are interested in that.\n\n0:11:48\tSPEAKER_00\n And I don't think the scroll wheel offers new functionality.\n\n0:11:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Whereas speech recognition and LCD screen do offer new functionality in your product.\n\n0:11:56\tSPEAKER_02\n But I think we now already have to implement an advanced chip.\n\n0:12:01\tSPEAKER_02\n I think so because if...\n\n0:12:03\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we're...\n\n0:12:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Especially if you're going...\n\n0:12:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe if you have the two editions you want to give out, probably you have one with speech recognition.\n\n0:12:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, they basically can have speech recognition.\n\n0:12:15\tSPEAKER_01\n It's mainly focused on the LCD aspect.\n\n0:12:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Hold on a minute, were you finished?\n\n0:12:20\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:12:21\tSPEAKER_00\n But that's okay.\n\n0:12:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Because if there's something else...\n\n0:12:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Did you want it to see them?\n\n0:12:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Did you have all the materials or everything?\n\n0:12:28\tSPEAKER_02\n This was the last one.\n\n0:12:29\tSPEAKER_02\n I have a solution.\n\n0:12:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Just go for the design from now.\n\n0:12:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Just have a seat for a second.\n\n0:12:36\tSPEAKER_00\n We'll combine everything.\n\n0:12:38\tSPEAKER_01\n So this is basically the deluxe edition?\n\n0:12:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Why is it squared?\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Why did you pick square?\n\n0:12:45\tSPEAKER_00\n It's basically...\n\n0:12:48\tSPEAKER_01\n It has some futuristic...\n\n0:12:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Ten-chill.\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't really know, but I just thought that...\n\n0:12:56\tSPEAKER_01\n In normal remote controls you have like smooth curves and this and that.\n\n0:13:01\tSPEAKER_01\n And this is something new.\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_01\n This is something different, something fresh.\n\n0:13:05\tSPEAKER_00\n It's true.\n\n0:13:07\tSPEAKER_01\n And basically what you can see here is that it has a little...\n\n0:13:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that's a gap.\n\n0:13:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Which you can put your finger in.\n\n0:13:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so just...\n\n0:13:16\tSPEAKER_01\n You can hold it really comfortable.\n\n0:13:18\tSPEAKER_01\n That's basically the...\n\n0:13:19\tSPEAKER_03\n But it's only in right hand and then...\n\n0:13:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Or left hand.\n\n0:13:22\tSPEAKER_00\n It's just a really nice...\n\n0:13:23\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a curve inside the thing.\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_01\n As you can see, this is the...\n\n0:13:26\tSPEAKER_01\n It's on the back.\n\n0:13:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, on the back, okay.\n\n0:13:29\tSPEAKER_01\n You can't really see that well.\n\n0:13:30\tSPEAKER_01\n But this is the LCD screen.\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_01\n So just imagine it goes that way.\n\n0:13:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh yeah, I know.\n\n0:13:36\tSPEAKER_01\n And you can see you can hold it in your left or in your right hand.\n\n0:13:39\tSPEAKER_01\n And I also made a quick image because I did not have that much time of the standard edition.\n\n0:13:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Which has basically the keys are pretty much the same.\n\n0:13:53\tSPEAKER_00\n The keys are probably the number keys, I suppose.\n\n0:13:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:57\tSPEAKER_01\n I had to do this really fast.\n\n0:13:59\tSPEAKER_01\n So, excuse me for the inconvenience here.\n\n0:14:03\tSPEAKER_01\n As you can see, the keys moved.\n\n0:14:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, you can work on the actual console or actual design later with them.\n\n0:14:08\tSPEAKER_01\n So these are basically the two types we have.\n\n0:14:10\tSPEAKER_01\n So if we were to select the LCD screen, the transmitter here, you can see the lights...\n\n0:14:16\tSPEAKER_00\n One thing you have to keep in mind is that you're moving the number keys from the top.\n\n0:14:24\tSPEAKER_00\n And the simple design, you have them at the top.\n\n0:14:27\tSPEAKER_00\n And the complex design, you have them at the bottom.\n\n0:14:29\tSPEAKER_00\n So it would give us a totally different design.\n\n0:14:33\tSPEAKER_00\n So it's actually making a whole different product instead of two different models.\n\n0:14:37\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it would be very expensive to produce two whole different products.\n\n0:14:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we can shift that.\n\n0:14:42\tSPEAKER_01\n But normally, as you can see there, we put the number buttons right on top.\n\n0:14:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Whereas because we have the LCD screen here, we had to move them downwards.\n\n0:14:52\tSPEAKER_01\n So what you could say is that...\n\n0:14:54\tSPEAKER_00\n For example, why did you pick the numbers all the way below and the channels and volume controls?\n\n0:15:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Because these are basically the functions you use the most.\n\n0:15:03\tSPEAKER_01\n So if you hold it in your hand like this, you put your finger in the gap.\n\n0:15:07\tSPEAKER_01\n This is the most easy part.\n\n0:15:09\tSPEAKER_01\n For example, because people are zapping most of the time,\n\n0:15:14\tSPEAKER_00\n to get into consideration what people would prefer. Okay, if you all agree, I'm fine with it.\n\n0:15:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, so that's pretty much what I had in mind, as you can see here, this can be space for extra keys or just be design things.\n\n0:15:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe it's better to look at what the people want.\n\n0:15:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:37\tSPEAKER_03\n So I can show my festigation.\n\n0:15:40\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we're going towards the looks edition anyway.\n\n0:15:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we're going to see what they want now.\n\n0:15:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Especially for young people.\n\n0:15:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Where is it?\n\n0:15:52\tSPEAKER_00\n That's mine.\n\n0:15:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, yeah, you should send it to the folder first.\n\n0:16:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, let's just assume we go for it's one.\n\n0:16:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, now it must be there.\n\n0:16:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, here it is.\n\n0:16:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, the festigation turns out that most people want to look and feel like.\n\n0:16:41\tSPEAKER_03\n It's the same as before, but it must be a little bit fancier than the look of it.\n\n0:16:49\tSPEAKER_03\n The second important thing is it must be technological and innovative.\n\n0:16:58\tSPEAKER_03\n So there's the LCD screen is perfect, I think.\n\n0:17:01\tSPEAKER_01\n And not the speech recognition.\n\n0:17:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that's very important.\n\n0:17:07\tSPEAKER_03\n And the third thing is it should be easy to use.\n\n0:17:12\tSPEAKER_03\n So not too much buttons and channel selection.\n\n0:17:16\tSPEAKER_03\n I think that's what you showed is perfect.\n\n0:17:21\tSPEAKER_03\n And what the young people want is in Paris and Milan.\n\n0:17:28\tSPEAKER_03\n It showed out that the fruit and vegetables are trendy.\n\n0:17:33\tSPEAKER_03\n You see it in the clothes and everything.\n\n0:17:36\tSPEAKER_03\n And the contrast of it, the buttons must be a little bit spongey material.\n\n0:17:42\tSPEAKER_03\n So Robert, I think that's the best.\n\n0:17:46\tSPEAKER_03\n It would be the best as a material.\n\n0:17:50\tSPEAKER_03\n We were focusing on the younger people.\n\n0:17:52\tSPEAKER_03\n So the elderly.\n\n0:17:54\tSPEAKER_03\n They wanted a little bit of wood in it.\n\n0:17:58\tSPEAKER_03\n That's not important.\n\n0:18:00\tSPEAKER_01\n It could be a cover.\n\n0:18:02\tSPEAKER_01\n But it's not.\n\n0:18:04\tSPEAKER_01\n It focuses the young audience.\n\n0:18:06\tSPEAKER_03\n So let's stick to that.\n\n0:18:08\tSPEAKER_03\n I thought it makes a young classic remote with...\n\n0:18:13\tSPEAKER_00\n I think in this case you're losing the focus on the fruit.\n\n0:18:17\tSPEAKER_03\n That's why I do that.\n\n0:18:19\tSPEAKER_00\n That's what we're focusing on.\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_00\n So I think the spongy field gives us rubber.\n\n0:18:23\tSPEAKER_03\n With fruit.\n\n0:18:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, with a pearly...\n\n0:18:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Cofer or something like that.\n\n0:18:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, maybe also.\n\n0:18:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I tend to disagree with the sharp form.\n\n0:18:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Especially if you're saying fruits and vegetables, maybe it's supposed to be a little more round.\n\n0:18:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, a little more round.\n\n0:18:38\tSPEAKER_03\n In form of a vegetable or fruit.\n\n0:18:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, for example.\n\n0:18:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but that's just more a seasonal...\n\n0:18:44\tSPEAKER_01\n A trend thing.\n\n0:18:46\tSPEAKER_01\n That's what we're doing.\n\n0:18:47\tSPEAKER_01\n The idea now is that you can put a cover on it.\n\n0:18:51\tSPEAKER_01\n For example, with fruit like a shape or whatever.\n\n0:18:55\tSPEAKER_01\n I think shape is a bit...\n\n0:18:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, you guys do that really.\n\n0:18:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Next year, it'll be something completely different.\n\n0:19:01\tSPEAKER_01\n And then you have your apple-shaped remote control.\n\n0:19:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Which is not trendy anymore.\n\n0:19:06\tSPEAKER_00\n So I think that's more something you can focus.\n\n0:19:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Like your start-track phaser thing shape control.\n\n0:19:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, you can...\n\n0:19:12\tSPEAKER_00\n It's really sharp.\n\n0:19:13\tSPEAKER_01\n What you can do is smooth the edges indeed.\n\n0:19:16\tSPEAKER_01\n But that will bring extra expenses.\n\n0:19:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Or maybe just make it into a little...\n\n0:19:21\tSPEAKER_00\n A smooth curve instead of just a bit sharp...\n\n0:19:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Or fruit and vegetables around.\n\n0:19:26\tSPEAKER_03\n So it's better.\n\n0:19:27\tSPEAKER_00\n I think there needs to be a little...\n\n0:19:29\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's too sharp.\n\n0:19:31\tSPEAKER_00\n The edges are too sharp.\n\n0:19:32\tSPEAKER_00\n The bottom is fine.\n\n0:19:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Of course, if it's square, we just make the top a little rounded off on the sides.\n\n0:19:38\tSPEAKER_00\n I think according to my information,\n\n0:19:40\tSPEAKER_02\n this would be two curves. That would be two curves.\n\n0:19:45\tSPEAKER_02\n We have one less than one right.\n\n0:19:47\tSPEAKER_02\n And that's this Ables.\n\n0:19:48\tSPEAKER_02\n What was it again?\n\n0:19:49\tSPEAKER_02\n It is something that we could not do then.\n\n0:19:52\tSPEAKER_00\n One curve.\n\n0:19:53\tSPEAKER_00\n You could also make the curve go through.\n\n0:19:55\tSPEAKER_00\n But that would make it a top round.\n\n0:19:57\tSPEAKER_01\n We've got one curve here.\n\n0:19:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, that's not a problem.\n\n0:20:00\tSPEAKER_02\n That's one of the titanium.\n\n0:20:02\tSPEAKER_03\n That's what we can have on here.\n\n0:20:04\tSPEAKER_03\n It's not for the trendy thing of it.\n\n0:20:07\tSPEAKER_01\n No, no, no, no.\n\n0:20:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Because you mentioned that more curves, the more expensive.\n\n0:20:12\tSPEAKER_01\n So I'm just taking that.\n\n0:20:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:20:14\tSPEAKER_00\n But that's a titanium.\n\n0:20:16\tSPEAKER_00\n It would give us only one curve.\n\n0:20:18\tSPEAKER_00\n But we don't have a knife.\n\n0:20:19\tSPEAKER_00\n We're not using titanium.\n\n0:20:20\tSPEAKER_00\n No, we have no knife.\n\n0:20:21\tSPEAKER_00\n But we picked rubber, right?\n\n0:20:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:20:23\tSPEAKER_00\n We did.\n\n0:20:24\tSPEAKER_00\n So basically what we can do is...\n\n0:20:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Just do something on the board.\n\n0:20:28\tSPEAKER_01\n H is a little bit less sharp.\n\n0:20:31\tSPEAKER_01\n But the problem then is, is that it will start to resemble the remote controls as we have them today.\n\n0:20:37\tSPEAKER_01\n We were looking at something fresh, something trendy.\n\n0:20:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, actually we're setting ourselves apart by technology alone, actually.\n\n0:20:45\tSPEAKER_00\n So that...\n\n0:20:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's see what you're doing.\n\n0:20:49\tSPEAKER_02\n These are what they call the curves.\n\n0:20:52\tSPEAKER_02\n This side.\n\n0:20:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, I like that.\n\n0:20:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Not really the curves on the side of the...\n\n0:20:57\tSPEAKER_02\n No, this is what they mean.\n\n0:20:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, okay.\n\n0:21:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, now I understand why they have more like...\n\n0:21:07\tSPEAKER_00\n where the curves decrease the...\n\n0:21:12\tSPEAKER_00\n the size of the electrons that can be inside.\n\n0:21:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:21:17\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't think the outside would be called as a curve, really.\n\n0:21:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, that's not it.\n\n0:21:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Thanks for all the basic model looking from the side.\n\n0:21:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Anyway.\n\n0:21:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, I should come up with some designs fast anyway.\n\n0:21:32\tSPEAKER_03\n But you can make...\n\n0:21:34\tSPEAKER_03\n if you want to use fruit in the...\n\n0:21:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:21:39\tSPEAKER_01\n But isn't the fruit like a cover thing?\n\n0:21:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, you shouldn't focus on the...\n\n0:21:44\tSPEAKER_00\n I covered it because a lot of things we came up with.\n\n0:21:46\tSPEAKER_00\n You shouldn't be too much.\n\n0:21:48\tSPEAKER_00\n You can make a list on the covers because...\n\n0:21:50\tSPEAKER_00\n No, it's kind of an idea of our own.\n\n0:21:52\tSPEAKER_01\n But we're not sure if we can actually make that.\n\n0:21:54\tSPEAKER_01\n We limit ourselves extremely because that's just for one...\n\n0:21:59\tSPEAKER_00\n That's one thing I'm all afraid of with this one because the edges are really...\n\n0:22:03\tSPEAKER_00\n They might stick out on the side.\n\n0:22:06\tSPEAKER_00\n For example, if you have a basic design, a little smaller on the edges, you could put more coverage on it, one with square or sharp corners if you want to.\n\n0:22:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, that's probably...\n\n0:22:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Just round it off a little, I guess, because we have more options.\n\n0:22:22\tSPEAKER_01\n I think so because it looks leaner.\n\n0:22:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:22:26\tSPEAKER_00\n We should just go with that.\n\n0:22:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Anyway, you have all the time in the world to make the final design in a minute with him, so...\n\n0:22:31\tSPEAKER_00\n So we decided on what...\n\n0:22:33\tSPEAKER_00\n What did you guys want to know again?\n\n0:22:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Because this is...\n\n0:22:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Anyway, I'll fire up my thing, so...\n\n0:22:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Did you do that?\n\n0:22:42\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll do a decision.\n\n0:22:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Present everything you wanted to.\n\n0:22:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:22:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Shall I...\n\n0:22:48\tSPEAKER_02\n I can quickly make a conclusion.\n\n0:22:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:22:52\tSPEAKER_02\n We have decided so far.\n\n0:22:54\tSPEAKER_01\n We still need to decide on my couple of things here.\n\n0:22:57\tSPEAKER_01\n You need it to know.\n\n0:23:00\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, anyway.\n\n0:23:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Energy.\n\n0:23:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Choose regular batteries.\n\n0:23:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:13\tSPEAKER_00\n The chip is advanced because we have the advanced features.\n\n0:23:17\tSPEAKER_00\n In the case, it will be... the material will be rubber, I suppose.\n\n0:23:20\tSPEAKER_00\n In the design we talked about.\n\n0:23:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Use interface type.\n\n0:23:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, I think we took all the components separately what we want.\n\n0:23:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's see.\n\n0:23:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Supplements.\n\n0:23:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Not sure what they mean by that, anyway.\n\n0:23:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Apparently you guys should work together on the final design, both on internal and external design.\n\n0:23:46\tSPEAKER_00\n So, you should probably find out how the product will fall into the market, how it's going to happen.\n\n0:23:54\tSPEAKER_00\n With the final design as we have it now.\n\n0:23:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Of course you get your specific instructions as usual.\n\n0:24:04\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm just going to say, I think we're in a pretty much an agreement actually, which is good.\n\n0:24:09\tSPEAKER_01\n So, we're all in agreement about the primary structure of my design.\n\n0:24:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Except for the other pin go here.\n\n0:24:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Like the keys.\n\n0:24:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I'll open your thing again.\n\n0:24:22\tSPEAKER_00\n If you come up with anything new.\n\n0:24:25\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll just do the next one.\n\n0:24:28\tSPEAKER_00\n So, what would give us your design would be?\n\n0:24:31\tSPEAKER_00\n The lights would be on top, right?\n\n0:24:33\tSPEAKER_00\n One on each side.\n\n0:24:35\tSPEAKER_01\n To create a kind of disco effect when you...\n\n0:24:38\tSPEAKER_01\n That was basically...\n\n0:24:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Is it the lights for finding the remote or the lights that...\n\n0:24:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Lights for the finding of the remote.\n\n0:24:46\tSPEAKER_01\n We can also use one light for showing that the signal is being sent.\n\n0:24:51\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that would just be simple lead or something.\n\n0:24:54\tSPEAKER_00\n That's not that important.\n\n0:24:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Of course, it's just like a matter of a beep if you...\n\n0:24:59\tSPEAKER_00\n You just know that there's contacts, so I don't think that's super important.\n\n0:25:03\tSPEAKER_00\n But...\n\n0:25:08\tSPEAKER_01\n So, we have the teletects...\n\n0:25:10\tSPEAKER_01\n We have here, we have the mute LCD screen.\n\n0:25:14\tSPEAKER_01\n This is the on-off button.\n\n0:25:17\tSPEAKER_03\n And speech recognition.\n\n0:25:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Speech recognition.\n\n0:25:20\tSPEAKER_01\n I...\n\n0:25:21\tSPEAKER_01\n What did I imagine?\n\n0:25:22\tSPEAKER_01\n How did that...\n\n0:25:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Pretty much over here.\n\n0:25:24\tSPEAKER_01\n You could use it like this.\n\n0:25:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Recorder and...\n\n0:25:28\tSPEAKER_01\n And speak to it.\n\n0:25:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Then you have the...\n\n0:25:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Extrarchy, so teletects, mute two buttons, which can be...\n\n0:25:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Pretty much anything or nothing.\n\n0:25:38\tSPEAKER_01\n We can also just not use them.\n\n0:25:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's see.\n\n0:25:41\tSPEAKER_01\n I'll just make...\n\n0:25:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Made controls, and they keep it.\n\n0:25:44\tSPEAKER_00\n One light here.\n\n0:25:47\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm just making it red now, but there'll be any color.\n\n0:25:50\tSPEAKER_00\n We find.\n\n0:25:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:25:52\tNone\n Whatever.\n\n0:25:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Fine, anyway.\n\n0:25:54\tSPEAKER_00\n What do we have here?\n\n0:25:56\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll make it.\n\n0:25:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Are we going to use square buttons or round ones, actually?\n\n0:26:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Personally, I prefer round ones.\n\n0:26:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Right, true.\n\n0:26:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but the...\n\n0:26:06\tSPEAKER_01\n This was just in the design.\n\n0:26:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Because I have a square design, so I had...\n\n0:26:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:26:11\tSPEAKER_01\n But in that case, round buttons would be more...\n\n0:26:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, I see.\n\n0:26:14\tSPEAKER_00\n So we take a round power button right here.\n\n0:26:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Whatever.\n\n0:26:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Back to black.\n\n0:26:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Not too big, though.\n\n0:26:27\tSPEAKER_00\n I guess it would be good.\n\n0:26:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's see.\n\n0:26:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Where are these for you?\n\n0:26:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Extra controls.\n\n0:26:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:26:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Left one.\n\n0:26:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Teletext, and the right one is mute.\n\n0:26:47\tSPEAKER_01\n And these two buttons are...\n\n0:26:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:26:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Or not necessary.\n\n0:26:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Or...\n\n0:26:51\tSPEAKER_00\n If we go for round buttons in general, do we want to...\n\n0:26:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Do we want to...\n\n0:26:57\tSPEAKER_00\n The menu key in the middle to be round?\n\n0:26:58\tSPEAKER_00\n For example, if you...\n\n0:26:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's see.\n\n0:27:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Put it this here.\n\n0:27:01\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we'll go with the triangles, though.\n\n0:27:03\tNone\n Come on.\n\n0:27:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, the triangles will be best in the...\n\n0:27:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Triangles are good.\n\n0:27:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe they're a little too big now, but...\n\n0:27:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Anyway, okay.\n\n0:27:17\tSPEAKER_00\n So do you want, for example, a...\n\n0:27:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Round button in the middle, or square one?\n\n0:27:26\tSPEAKER_01\n I personally think that a round button looks a bit silly, but...\n\n0:27:31\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not sure.\n\n0:27:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Just carry on with it.\n\n0:27:34\tSPEAKER_00\n This aligns nicely.\n\n0:27:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:27:39\tSPEAKER_00\n We'll just take the...\n\n0:27:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Take the round button, suppose.\n\n0:27:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, this square button, sorry.\n\n0:27:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Does everybody agree on that?\n\n0:27:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, just a round one.\n\n0:27:49\tSPEAKER_02\n That's a matter.\n\n0:27:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:27:53\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not a big deal.\n\n0:27:56\tSPEAKER_00\n So, there's our numbers.\n\n0:28:05\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we need an extra button here, of course, for...\n\n0:28:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, like you had for the...\n\n0:28:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Higher numbers.\n\n0:28:14\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm...\n\n0:28:15\tSPEAKER_00\n You could include a button here for the mute, I suppose, for something else, just to...\n\n0:28:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, you can.\n\n0:28:24\tSPEAKER_00\n You can't put it in the effect.\n\n0:28:25\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not necessary.\n\n0:28:26\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not necessary, because you can take this away, but it looks like there's a hole there, just to mirror the effect.\n\n0:28:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so we have a few.\n\n0:28:33\tSPEAKER_01\n We could put a logo there.\n\n0:28:35\tSPEAKER_00\n No, I think it would be nice to put the logo here, for example.\n\n0:28:37\tSPEAKER_00\n If you have some buttons here, we could put a logo here, because it's very...\n\n0:28:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, it's in your field of vision, if you're watching it, the LCD screen, blah, blah.\n\n0:28:49\tSPEAKER_03\n What about the button for your favorite channel?\n\n0:28:53\tSPEAKER_03\n We could include either here...\n\n0:28:55\tSPEAKER_03\n With the extra control here.\n\n0:28:57\tSPEAKER_00\n For example, you can hear it here.\n\n0:28:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Now it's getting a little bit too crowded up there.\n\n0:29:01\tSPEAKER_03\n I know.\n\n0:29:02\tSPEAKER_01\n So, you have to see that the...\n\n0:29:04\tSPEAKER_01\n So, it can basically be the button down below, or one of the four buttons.\n\n0:29:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, but this one has a favorite channel.\n\n0:29:11\tSPEAKER_03\n One of the four, I think.\n\n0:29:12\tSPEAKER_03\n One of these four, okay.\n\n0:29:13\tSPEAKER_03\n So, favorite channel?\n\n0:29:14\tSPEAKER_04\n What?\n\n0:29:15\tSPEAKER_03\n No, one of the four...\n\n0:29:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Because it's really confusing to have 12 buttons down there, because you're only accustomed to 11.\n\n0:29:26\tSPEAKER_01\n I'd say...\n\n0:29:28\tSPEAKER_00\n You accustomed to 11?\n\n0:29:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Am I okay?\n\n0:29:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Have it your way.\n\n0:29:32\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, I think this looks better.\n\n0:29:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Like, that's something missing, for example.\n\n0:29:38\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, why wouldn't you include...\n\n0:29:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Because there's a piece of electronics under there anyway, so why don't you give it a function?\n\n0:29:45\tSPEAKER_00\n It could be anything, but...\n\n0:29:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, you could also shift the two buttons to be nicely aligned.\n\n0:29:50\tSPEAKER_00\n No, I don't think...\n\n0:29:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Because this is zero.\n\n0:29:52\tSPEAKER_00\n You wouldn't...\n\n0:29:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Zero to be misaligned with the rest.\n\n0:29:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Anyway, so this is the basic design we want to have on and off.\n\n0:29:59\tSPEAKER_00\n What are we missing?\n\n0:30:02\tSPEAKER_01\n We're missing an okay button, but we have a button up there.\n\n0:30:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so we want the remote to be this side view, actually, when I'm going to draw.\n\n0:30:12\tSPEAKER_00\n So...\n\n0:30:15\tSPEAKER_00\n I probably think you want the curve to be here.\n\n0:30:21\tSPEAKER_00\n So, have your finger under here like this?\n\n0:30:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:30:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Just going to be...\n\n0:30:33\tSPEAKER_00\n One that's straight, or what?\n\n0:30:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's keep it like this.\n\n0:30:37\tSPEAKER_00\n So it would be like this.\n\n0:30:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Do you want something interesting with it?\n\n0:30:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Or...\n\n0:30:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's see.\n\n0:30:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Would give us light here.\n\n0:30:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe it's born.\n\n0:30:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Do you want it curved?\n\n0:30:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Or what?\n\n0:30:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe you want...\n\n0:30:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Better curved, but that's probably...\n\n0:30:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Would give us a design problem because we have...\n\n0:30:58\tSPEAKER_01\n It can be curved.\n\n0:31:00\tSPEAKER_01\n It can be curved because it's a little bit more...\n\n0:31:03\tSPEAKER_01\n It can be curved.\n\n0:31:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, I think so.\n\n0:31:05\tSPEAKER_00\n That's why I ask it.\n\n0:31:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so...\n\n0:31:11\tSPEAKER_02\n I would give us a hole, actually.\n\n0:31:15\tSPEAKER_02\n I would give us a hole like...\n\n0:31:18\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a little bit over your hands, a little bit.\n\n0:31:23\tSPEAKER_02\n And that's well balanced, and you're doing to drop it easily.\n\n0:31:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Anyway, show you what...\n\n0:31:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Two little...\n\n0:31:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Like this?\n\n0:31:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, something like this.\n\n0:31:38\tNone\n And just...\n\n0:31:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes, exactly.\n\n0:31:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Stop the curve here, or...\n\n0:31:43\tSPEAKER_02\n I think continue.\n\n0:31:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Like that.\n\n0:31:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, yeah, oh, this is the screen.\n\n0:31:50\tSPEAKER_01\n It looks like a banana, right?\n\n0:31:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:54\tSPEAKER_01\n It's made yellow, it's banana-vision.\n\n0:31:57\tSPEAKER_00\n It's fruit.\n\n0:31:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:59\tSPEAKER_00\n It's perfect.\n\n0:32:00\tSPEAKER_00\n So, I have here else this screen right here.\n\n0:32:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Suppose...\n\n0:32:10\tSPEAKER_00\n They would make...\n\n0:32:13\tSPEAKER_00\n We use the colors now.\n\n0:32:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe once we can make a special edition in accordance with Shakita.\n\n0:32:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, some sponsors.\n\n0:32:25\tSPEAKER_00\n You got sponsors now, you get a free one with every package of Kida.\n\n0:32:28\tSPEAKER_02\n But it's good for them.\n\n0:32:29\tSPEAKER_02\n If they can have no logo on it.\n\n0:32:32\tSPEAKER_00\n So, you give the buttons here.\n\n0:32:34\tSPEAKER_01\n They can design their own cover.\n\n0:32:36\tSPEAKER_00\n They might want to be...\n\n0:32:37\tSPEAKER_00\n I suppose we can put...\n\n0:32:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, agreement.\n\n0:32:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Let's see.\n\n0:32:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Perhaps they can use it.\n\n0:32:45\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's a special edition.\n\n0:32:47\tSPEAKER_00\n I suppose we can put the batteries in here because it has the most space.\n\n0:32:51\tSPEAKER_01\n For example.\n\n0:32:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Won't that be a problem with the LCD screen?\n\n0:32:55\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't think so, because it's the biggest part of the...\n\n0:32:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but the LCD screen probably needs quite the chip.\n\n0:33:02\tSPEAKER_02\n I think this is possible.\n\n0:33:04\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's possible.\n\n0:33:05\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's the best place to put them here.\n\n0:33:07\tSPEAKER_02\n But it doesn't matter.\n\n0:33:08\tSPEAKER_02\n You can actually place a chip for the LCD screen at the bottom and wire it.\n\n0:33:12\tSPEAKER_00\n That's not a problem.\n\n0:33:14\tSPEAKER_00\n But the battery is here.\n\n0:33:16\tNone\n That's fine.\n\n0:33:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:23\tSPEAKER_00\n La.\n\n0:33:24\tSPEAKER_01\n I think we get the edit.\n\n0:33:27\tSPEAKER_00\n What are we missing here?\n\n0:33:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Something...\n\n0:33:32\tSPEAKER_00\n A speech recognition.\n\n0:33:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Where do we want the microphone, for example, to be on the side or on the...\n\n0:33:39\tSPEAKER_00\n For example, on top, like there.\n\n0:33:41\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a really easy idea that I had, I think, to be pretty much in combination with the transmitter.\n\n0:33:47\tSPEAKER_01\n You can talk to it like this.\n\n0:33:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, I thought maybe it'd either be here or because it might interfere with the transmitter.\n\n0:33:55\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not sure.\n\n0:33:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Because transmitter would be here.\n\n0:34:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, the email said it was quite a small component, so I don't...\n\n0:34:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Once again, like you said, the component can be somewhere at the bottom.\n\n0:34:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Why are the microphones up there?\n\n0:34:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Anyway.\n\n0:34:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it could be that we're here or make a double microphone.\n\n0:34:18\tSPEAKER_00\n How in mind?\n\n0:34:20\tSPEAKER_02\n It is, I believe, also able to talk.\n\n0:34:22\tSPEAKER_02\n It's able to talk to you.\n\n0:34:24\tSPEAKER_02\n I have a sample sensor and a speaker sensor.\n\n0:34:28\tSPEAKER_00\n A speaker sensor?\n\n0:34:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, the speaker sensor we already have, but I don't know what they exactly mean by a sample sensor.\n\n0:34:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Could it talk back, like give confirmation or something?\n\n0:34:38\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it can.\n\n0:34:40\tSPEAKER_02\n I think if you have a speaker recognition component...\n\n0:34:43\tSPEAKER_00\n I think so.\n\n0:34:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Speaking of it, there's not that hard to put in either.\n\n0:34:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:48\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, it could be...\n\n0:34:49\tSPEAKER_00\n All this stuff could be integrated into the LCD screen, which you could navigate with this, I suppose.\n\n0:34:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Navigate through everything.\n\n0:34:55\tSPEAKER_00\n I think the advanced option should be...\n\n0:34:58\tSPEAKER_00\n I think the advanced option could also be integrated into the LCD screen, of course, because you don't have to have a button for everything.\n\n0:35:04\tSPEAKER_00\n You just navigate through your menu that you have here for advanced options with this.\n\n0:35:08\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it would be fine.\n\n0:35:10\tSPEAKER_00\n That would be making use of the LCD screen.\n\n0:35:15\tSPEAKER_02\n We already have a sound component, by the way, for the beep.\n\n0:35:19\tSPEAKER_02\n So, beep.\n\n0:35:21\tSPEAKER_00\n So, the flashing of the beep, we have, well, anything we could...\n\n0:35:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, you could put a speaker or something on the side.\n\n0:35:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n0:35:34\tNone\n We're on the side.\n\n0:35:35\tSPEAKER_00\n We're on.\n\n0:35:36\tSPEAKER_00\n How do you draw those again?\n\n0:35:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Whatever.\n\n0:35:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Looks stupid.\n\n0:35:44\tSPEAKER_01\n So, what's basically the idea?\n\n0:35:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Sorry.\n\n0:35:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Now, we need to stay here, work out.\n\n0:35:51\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm not sure.\n\n0:35:52\tSPEAKER_02\n I should be thinking of a new idea.\n\n0:35:54\tSPEAKER_00\n I guess we're supposed to, if I've finished the meeting.\n\n0:35:57\tSPEAKER_00\n No, like my... The info that I got was that you're...\n\n0:36:02\tSPEAKER_00\n We're going to work on our own, because you're going to do the market...\n\n0:36:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:06\tSPEAKER_00\n...and rising there.\n\n0:36:08\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm supposed to do the little work on the year end reports, uh...\n\n0:36:11\tSPEAKER_00\n...the project report.\n\n0:36:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:36:15\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we're...\n\n0:36:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, I suppose you're...\n\n0:36:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Everybody satisfied with the current design we have?\n\n0:36:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:36:20\tSPEAKER_00\n So, where is...\n\n0:36:21\tSPEAKER_00\n It's fine.\n\n0:36:22\tSPEAKER_00\n It's supposed to be rubber, I think...\n\n0:36:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, I think the remote control is going to be black.\n\n0:36:25\tSPEAKER_00\n We forgot to talk about...\n\n0:36:27\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, the company colors are important, apparently.\n\n0:36:30\tSPEAKER_00\n So, we have to logo up there.\n\n0:36:32\tSPEAKER_00\n And we're going to...\n\n0:36:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Base color is black.\n\n0:36:34\tSPEAKER_00\n And yellow.\n\n0:36:36\tSPEAKER_00\n And yellow, of course.\n\n0:36:37\tSPEAKER_00\n We can use yellow buttons or yellow navigation or whatever.\n\n0:36:39\tSPEAKER_02\n I would change.\n\n0:36:40\tSPEAKER_02\n I would take a yellow...\n\n0:36:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Yellow control.\n\n0:36:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Yellow control?\n\n0:36:43\tSPEAKER_02\n It's...\n\n0:36:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but when you use...\n\n0:36:46\tSPEAKER_01\n...couple...\n\n0:36:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Basically, you need to have a neutral color on the base.\n\n0:36:51\tSPEAKER_00\n But don't stick yourself on the cover, because...\n\n0:36:54\tSPEAKER_01\n No, we're designing the remote control now.\n\n0:36:56\tSPEAKER_01\n But taking that into consideration is...\n\n0:36:58\tSPEAKER_01\n It's better to have a neutral base color than to have a flashy...\n\n0:37:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but the info...\n\n0:37:04\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we should go with the company color, because it's...\n\n0:37:07\tSPEAKER_00\n...specific info that I got from Project Bored.\n\n0:37:09\tSPEAKER_00\n So, the young people want to...\n\n0:37:11\tSPEAKER_03\n...trendy remote control.\n\n0:37:13\tSPEAKER_02\n So, it's black cover with yellow buttons or vice versa.\n\n0:37:17\tSPEAKER_02\n And I would say take a yellow cover on black buttons.\n\n0:37:19\tSPEAKER_02\n It is more trendy.\n\n0:37:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Not too much.\n\n0:37:21\tSPEAKER_00\n I'd say take a yellow...\n\n0:37:24\tSPEAKER_00\n...yellow remote control.\n\n0:37:25\tSPEAKER_00\n So, let's see if we can do that onto it.\n\n0:37:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Just the basic colors.\n\n0:37:33\tSPEAKER_02\n We have some medical on the right.\n\n0:37:36\tSPEAKER_02\n You know what?\n\n0:37:37\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not going to do this.\n\n0:37:38\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's just a big thing.\n\n0:37:39\tSPEAKER_02\n It'll be different than...\n\n0:37:40\tSPEAKER_02\n...the beautiful.\n\n0:37:42\tSPEAKER_00\n That's a nice design for the next meeting we'll be done.\n\n0:37:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, happy now.\n\n0:37:49\tSPEAKER_02\n I still don't have my scroll wheel, though.\n\n0:37:52\tSPEAKER_02\n I know where we can put it.\n\n0:37:54\tSPEAKER_02\n La, la, la.\n\n0:37:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Still.\n\n0:37:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:37:57\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not sure.\n\n0:37:58\tSPEAKER_00\n I really.\n\n0:37:59\tSPEAKER_00\n I have no clue what we could use a scroll wheel for.\n\n0:38:02\tSPEAKER_00\n You could use it for the channel.\n\n0:38:03\tSPEAKER_01\n No, for the volume, but it has no...\n\n0:38:05\tSPEAKER_00\n It takes space.\n\n0:38:06\tSPEAKER_00\n A lot of space.\n\n0:38:07\tSPEAKER_00\n It's value.\n\n0:38:08\tSPEAKER_02\n No, that's not my point.\n\n0:38:09\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not because it's functional, but it's just to add to the design.\n\n0:38:12\tSPEAKER_02\n To have it flashy.\n\n0:38:13\tSPEAKER_02\n It has no function.\n\n0:38:14\tSPEAKER_00\n I agree.\n\n0:38:15\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not sure if it has no function.\n\n0:38:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Why even put it there?\n\n0:38:18\tSPEAKER_00\n I was wondering if it has no function.\n\n0:38:20\tSPEAKER_03\n So much, I think, the scroll channel selection or a full volume...\n\n0:38:23\tSPEAKER_00\n I think channels selection would be annoying because you could scroll past the channel or...\n\n0:38:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's vote a minute.\n\n0:38:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Then we don't have to talk about it any longer.\n\n0:38:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:38:31\tSPEAKER_02\n What do you want?\n\n0:38:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Inner-out.\n\n0:38:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Basically, out.\n\n0:38:34\tSPEAKER_02\n You are out of work.\n\n0:38:35\tSPEAKER_02\n You are out.\n\n0:38:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:38:37\tSPEAKER_00\n No, a scroll wheel.\n\n0:38:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:38:40\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't see anything missing, really.\n\n0:38:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we should...\n\n0:38:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Do you have to find it again?\n\n0:38:46\tSPEAKER_00\n I have all my answers.\n\n0:38:48\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not sure if we're going to get finance anyway because...\n\n0:38:52\tSPEAKER_00\n I thought it was going to be an issue at the first when we started.\n\n0:38:55\tSPEAKER_00\n I thought it was going to be a cost issue, which material are we going to take...\n\n0:38:59\tSPEAKER_00\n I have one question.\n\n0:39:00\tSPEAKER_00\n I have one question.\n\n0:39:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Is there anything I could do whatever you like?\n\n0:39:03\tSPEAKER_00\n I have one question.\n\n0:39:04\tSPEAKER_02\n I have one question.\n\n0:39:05\tSPEAKER_02\n But I don't have information that...\n\n0:39:06\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it shows in rubber.\n\n0:39:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Rubber is not expensive.\n\n0:39:09\tSPEAKER_02\n No, but can we make yellow rubber?\n\n0:39:10\tSPEAKER_02\n I think so.\n\n0:39:11\tSPEAKER_02\n You can make rubber any color.\n\n0:39:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, you can make yellow titanium.\n\n0:39:15\tSPEAKER_00\n But we have to make yellow rubber.\n\n0:39:17\tSPEAKER_03\n We don't use...\n\n0:39:19\tSPEAKER_03\n We remove a book cover.\n\n0:39:21\tSPEAKER_03\n We can make...\n\n0:39:22\tSPEAKER_00\n For example, it's just something you can click on it like that.\n\n0:39:26\tSPEAKER_00\n That's a bit of a thought.\n\n0:39:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Apparently, it's not something we're working with in the business.\n\n0:39:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe later, maybe we can...\n\n0:39:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it could be...\n\n0:39:35\tSPEAKER_00\n It can be done.\n\n0:39:36\tNone\n For example...\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "SPEAKER and SPELLER have a meeting.
