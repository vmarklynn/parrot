dinget niet gebruikt.\n\n0:00:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Goed moeiting.\n\n0:00:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Goeiemorgen.\n\n0:00:23\tNone\n Zou je tientig, zo.\n\n0:00:25\tNone\n Nee, ik denk dat ik dat niet

Ja.\n\n0:00:54\tNone\n Ja, ik wist niet op een filmmeltjes.\n\n0:00:56\tNone\n Ja, ok\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n0:01:02\tNone\n Sorry.\n\n0:01:03\tNone\n Goed moeiting.\n\n0:01:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, goedmorgen, alles goedmogen.\n\n0:01:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Goed moeiting.\n\n0:01:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Ik wil je de eerste meeting welkom te willen.\n\n0:01:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Ik heb een beetje een presentatie.\n\n0:01:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Mijn neem is Marijn Plomf.\n\n0:01:29\tSPEAKER_00\n En ik hoop dat je het een paar minuten in hetzelfde is.\n\n0:01:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Ik ben de projectmanager van deze project.\n\n0:01:36\tSPEAKER_00\n En, well, ik wil je vertellen wat het is.\n\n0:01:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Dit is de agenda voor de eerste meeting.\n\n0:01:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Dit is de opening.\n\n0:01:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Dan we hopen, we hopen, we get acquainted to each other.\n\n0:01:51\tSPEAKER_00\n We'll do a little tooltraining with these two things.\n\n0:01:55\tSPEAKER_00\n We'll take a look at the project plan.\n\n0:01:57\tSPEAKER_00\n There will be time for discussion.\n\n0:01:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Actually, we have to discuss, because we have to create a product.\n\n0:02:02\tSPEAKER_00\n And then we will close this session.\n\n0:02:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Maar, first of all, we'd like to introduce you to this room.\n\n0:02:11\tSPEAKER_00\n As you probably have noticed, there are a little black fields on the table.\n\n0:02:16\tSPEAKER_00\n You have to put your laptop exactly in that field.\n\n0:02:19\tSPEAKER_00\n So the little cameras can see your face.\n\n0:02:22\tSPEAKER_00\n There are cameras everywhere around the room, especially here, for your face coordinates.\n\n0:02:27\tSPEAKER_00\n And this isn't a pie.\n\n0:02:28\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a set of microphones.\n\n0:02:30\tSPEAKER_00\n And there are microphones here also.\n\n0:02:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Please don't be afraid of them.\n\n0:02:35\tSPEAKER_00\n They won't hurt you.\n\n0:02:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, as said, I'm the project manager, and I'm hoping for a good project.\n\n0:02:44\tSPEAKER_00\n And I'd like to hear who you are and what your functions are on this project.\n\n0:02:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's start with the ladies.\n\n0:02:51\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm Imkudio.\n\n0:02:53\tSPEAKER_01\n And my function is user interface design, I think.\n\n0:02:58\tSPEAKER_01\n So that's me.\n\n0:03:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, I'm Vaseline Nemare.\n\n0:03:04\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm the industrial designer.\n\n0:03:06\tSPEAKER_03\n And I hope to look forward to a very pleasing end of this project.\n\n0:03:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, so my name is Danny Mangrel.\n\n0:03:15\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm a marketing expert.\n\n0:03:18\tSPEAKER_02\n My job is in the company to promote the company, to promote products to the customers.\n\n0:03:24\tSPEAKER_02\n So I also hope we have a pleasant working with each other.\n\n0:03:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, well, we have some expertise from different pieces of the company.\n\n0:03:34\tSPEAKER_00\n That's good.\n\n0:03:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, as said, we're working on a project.\n\n0:03:39\tSPEAKER_00\n And the aim for the project is to create a new remote control, which has to be original, trendy, and of course, user-friendly.\n\n0:03:49\tSPEAKER_00\n And I hope we have the expertise to create such a project.\n\n0:03:53\tSPEAKER_00\n The way we hope to achieve that is through the following methods.\n\n0:03:58\tSPEAKER_00\n It consists of three phases, namely the functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design.\n\n0:04:04\tSPEAKER_00\n As you can see, all of these phases consist of two parts, namely individual work parts and a meeting where we will discuss our work so far.\n\n0:04:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, but first, I will tell you something about the tools we have here.\n\n0:04:19\tSPEAKER_00\n I already talked about the cameras and microphones, but they are not of much use to us.\n\n0:04:25\tSPEAKER_00\n We will have to take advantage of these two things.\n\n0:04:28\tSPEAKER_00\n They are smart boards.\n\n0:04:29\tSPEAKER_00\n As you can see, you can give a presentation on them.\n\n0:04:32\tSPEAKER_00\n And this one here is a white board.\n\n0:04:36\tSPEAKER_00\n And I will instruct you about that soon.\n\n0:04:40\tSPEAKER_00\n As you also noticed, this presentation document is in our project folder and every document you put in this folder is possible to show that here in our meeting room.\n\n0:04:53\tSPEAKER_00\n And there are available on both smart boards, but I think we will mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder.\n\n0:05:02\tSPEAKER_00\n As you can see, this is the same toolbar as it's located here.\n\n0:05:07\tSPEAKER_00\n The most functions we will use will be to add a new page.\n\n0:05:13\tSPEAKER_00\n To go back and forward between pages and of course to save it every now and then.\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_00\n And this is the pen with which you can draw on the board.\n\n0:05:23\tSPEAKER_00\n For instance, like this, everything is okay, but first I put it on the pen.\n\n0:05:29\tSPEAKER_00\n You see, I'm new to it too.\n\n0:05:31\tSPEAKER_00\n And then you can write things like test or whatever you want.\n\n0:05:36\tSPEAKER_00\n As you can see, you have to move it a little bit slow.\n\n0:05:38\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not such a fast board.\n\n0:05:40\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a smart board, but also a slow board.\n\n0:05:42\tSPEAKER_00\n But you can write things and of course you can also, when you click here, erase things.\n\n0:05:48\tSPEAKER_00\n So we have a test left.\n\n0:05:51\tSPEAKER_00\n And you can also delete an entire page, but we ask you not to do that.\n\n0:05:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Just simply create a new one and start all over because we want to save all the results.\n\n0:06:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Does everyone understand this?\n\n0:06:07\tSPEAKER_00\n So you can't erase anything.\n\n0:06:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, you can erase it with the eraser, but you shouldn't delete an entire page.\n\n0:06:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Just create a new blank one.\n\n0:06:15\tSPEAKER_00\n I will delete this one out because we don't use it yet.\n\n0:06:18\tSPEAKER_00\n But you can of course erase when you make a mistake, but don't delete entire pages.\n\n0:06:24\tSPEAKER_00\n And you can also, let's see, I think it's here, change the color of your pen.\n\n0:06:30\tSPEAKER_00\n For instance, take a blue one and change the line with five.\n\n0:06:38\tSPEAKER_00\n And that's what you will need for our first exercise because I'm going to ask you to draw your favorite animal.\n\n0:06:47\tSPEAKER_00\n It's also to get to know each other because I'm asking three things for that drawing.\n\n0:06:53\tSPEAKER_00\n To do it on a blank sheet with different colors.\n\n0:06:55\tSPEAKER_00\n And I just showed you how to pick a color and also with different pen widths, which I also showed you.\n\n0:07:02\tSPEAKER_00\n And favorite characteristic can be just one word.\n\n0:07:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, I'm not very good at drawing, but I will go first and try to draw.\n\n0:07:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing.\n\n0:07:25\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a sheep.\n\n0:07:29\tSPEAKER_03\n That's a seal.\n\n0:07:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Beaver.\n\n0:07:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, it could be everything.\n\n0:07:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe when I put on this thing, it could be a turtle snail or a snail.\n\n0:07:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Or the snail doesn't have legs.\n\n0:07:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Or the turtle has. And those are slow.\n\n0:08:02\tSPEAKER_00\n And I hope our project group will not be slow, but we will work to a good result and do it as fast as we can.\n\n0:08:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:08:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Time for another animal. Would you like to go next?\n\n0:08:15\tSPEAKER_02\n No problem.\n\n0:08:21\tSPEAKER_02\n That was forward.\n\n0:08:24\tSPEAKER_01\n That's good.\n\n0:08:42\tNone\n That help.\n\n0:08:49\tSPEAKER_03\n To make it a little bit easier.\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_02\n It should gear up.\n\n0:08:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Like that cute.\n\n0:09:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Or dinosaur.\n\n0:09:11\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's easy to recognize.\n\n0:09:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, the favorite character is that the long neck can reach everything.\n\n0:09:34\tSPEAKER_02\n And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project.\n\n0:09:38\tSPEAKER_02\n So that's my favorite animal.\n\n0:09:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:09:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Anything else you need to write?\n\n0:09:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, another more.\n\n0:09:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Toll.\n\n0:09:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Toll.\n\n0:09:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:09:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Good.\n\n0:10:01\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:10:04\tSPEAKER_01\n So I can draw with this.\n\n0:10:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Wow.\n\n0:10:18\tSPEAKER_03\n That's a must.\n\n0:10:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Bunny-rather.\n\n0:10:28\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:10:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:10:43\tSPEAKER_01\n One more.\n\n0:10:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:10:58\tSPEAKER_01\n You can guess what it is.\n\n0:11:01\tSPEAKER_01\n I hope.\n\n0:11:02\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a rabbit.\n\n0:11:04\tSPEAKER_01\n And well, it's a quick, I guess.\n\n0:11:19\tSPEAKER_01\n That's my favorite animal.\n\n0:11:26\tSPEAKER_00\n And a final drawing.\n\n0:11:29\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:11:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:12:05\tSPEAKER_03\n I draw a drawing.\n\n0:12:08\tSPEAKER_03\n A dolphin because of this intelligence.\n\n0:12:10\tSPEAKER_03\n One of the most intelligent animals in our world.\n\n0:12:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Dally-hub.\n\n0:12:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Dally-hub.\n\n0:12:25\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm sorry.\n\n0:12:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Eerator.\n\n0:12:28\tSPEAKER_01\n You can try it.\n\n0:12:29\tSPEAKER_01\n The eraser now.\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Then.\n\n0:12:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Perfect.\n\n0:12:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:12:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:12:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, thank you very much.\n\n0:12:41\tSPEAKER_00\n I can see we have some drawing talents.\n\n0:12:44\tSPEAKER_00\n What did you draw?\n\n0:12:45\tSPEAKER_00\n A drawing.\n\n0:12:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, nice animals, nice words.\n\n0:12:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Sounds good.\n\n0:12:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Back to business, back to the money part.\n\n0:12:59\tSPEAKER_00\n From the finance department, I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of 25 euros.\n\n0:13:04\tSPEAKER_00\n And we're hoping for a aim of 50 million euros.\n\n0:13:09\tSPEAKER_00\n And we're hoping to achieve that by aiming for an international market.\n\n0:13:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:13:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, it's time for some discussion.\n\n0:13:17\tSPEAKER_00\n I've wrote down some examples here of what we can speak about.\n\n0:13:21\tSPEAKER_00\n What's your experience with remote controls?\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_00\n What kind of ideas do you have to design and you remote control, maybe, for which market segments should be aimed?\n\n0:13:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Or should we aim for all segments?\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, actually, I'd like to hand the word back to you.\n\n0:13:35\tSPEAKER_00\n What's your experience with remote control?\n\n0:13:40\tSPEAKER_03\n A lot of buttons.\n\n0:13:41\tSPEAKER_03\n A lot of buttons, which you don't use.\n\n0:13:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Complex.\n\n0:13:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:13:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Not user friendly.\n\n0:13:51\tSPEAKER_01\n You need to search for the buttons which you want to reach in the...\n\n0:13:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Boring.\n\n0:13:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Boring.\n\n0:13:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Not fun to use in remote.\n\n0:14:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Black or black.\n\n0:14:03\tSPEAKER_03\n So, black colors.\n\n0:14:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, maybe we should try to make it fun.\n\n0:14:08\tSPEAKER_03\n We use batteries and last batteries and poor signal.\n\n0:14:15\tSPEAKER_01\n But we have a lot of remote controls.\n\n0:14:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Different remote control.\n\n0:14:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Different remote control.\n\n0:14:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Different devices.\n\n0:14:21\tSPEAKER_01\n But we can integrate them or something.\n\n0:14:24\tSPEAKER_03\n For the use of different devices.\n\n0:14:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Your stereo and your TV, you know.\n\n0:14:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, but then again, you still have a lot of buttons.\n\n0:14:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, but it's a possibility to put those buttons behind some kind of perfection.\n\n0:14:47\tSPEAKER_03\n So, if you only get the freedom when you need them.\n\n0:14:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:14:51\tSPEAKER_02\n It's possible.\n\n0:14:52\tSPEAKER_02\n So, did you get the...\n\n0:14:53\tSPEAKER_03\n No, no, no, no.\n\n0:14:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Did you just give it to me?\n\n0:14:56\tSPEAKER_03\n For example, you get the same size remote control you use every day.\n\n0:15:02\tSPEAKER_03\n The usual buttons such as a zapping, let's go to the Dutch.\n\n0:15:08\tSPEAKER_03\n And the following control are only the possible buttons to use directly.\n\n0:15:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Or the numbers.\n\n0:15:16\tSPEAKER_03\n The numbers, of course.\n\n0:15:18\tSPEAKER_03\n But not the buttons used to search on the channels on your television.\n\n0:15:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Young used those first time or play balls.\n\n0:15:27\tSPEAKER_00\n So, maybe a minimalist design.\n\n0:15:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n0:15:32\tSPEAKER_00\n It was one of buttons.\n\n0:15:33\tSPEAKER_01\n So, you should make sure that you have every button they need on it.\n\n0:15:36\tSPEAKER_01\n That's a...\n\n0:15:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Things for a daily text.\n\n0:15:39\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know that.\n\n0:15:40\tSPEAKER_03\n A daily text?\n\n0:15:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, that's it.\n\n0:15:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:15:46\tSPEAKER_00\n So, you don't want to bother people with loads of buttons.\n\n0:15:49\tSPEAKER_00\n But on the other hand, they need many buttons so they don't have to get out of their seat.\n\n0:15:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Because I think markets will be all kind of people, all the elderly, young people.\n\n0:16:00\tSPEAKER_01\n If it's international, you should look in...\n\n0:16:03\tSPEAKER_01\n...think in Britain, they have different things they can do with TV.\n\n0:16:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Or so that you can choose what you want to see.\n\n0:16:10\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know if you should take that in consideration.\n\n0:16:14\tSPEAKER_01\n It's just for the normal TV.\n\n0:16:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I think that's better because...\n\n0:16:20\tSPEAKER_02\n I think if you're going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only Britain, then...\n\n0:16:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, because we'll rise higher than 1250, I think.\n\n0:16:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I don't know if the TV is better to use the whole world and Britain.\n\n0:16:36\tSPEAKER_03\n No, I think the main idea of this remote control is...\n\n0:16:42\tSPEAKER_03\n...to make it user friendly.\n\n0:16:46\tSPEAKER_03\n So I think when the customers will buy this remote control, they already have a remote control which companies...\n\n0:16:55\tSPEAKER_03\n...with the standard remote control which comes with a television.\n\n0:17:01\tSPEAKER_03\n So it only has to have the most used buttons.\n\n0:17:05\tSPEAKER_03\n You don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television.\n\n0:17:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Then you have to find your other remote control buttons to search.\n\n0:17:15\tSPEAKER_03\n But it's impossible to accommodate all the buttons on the different televisions sets on one remote control.\n\n0:17:26\tSPEAKER_03\n It's impossible.\n\n0:17:28\tSPEAKER_03\n For example, Sony Television has the opportunity to make it possible for one side of the screen teletext on the other side.\n\n0:17:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Just regular television.\n\n0:17:40\tSPEAKER_02\n I think the most television nowadays do this.\n\n0:17:43\tSPEAKER_03\n They don't use the same signal on remote control because you can't use a Panasonic remote control on a Phillips television.\n\n0:17:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Then you have to choose the...\n\n0:17:52\tSPEAKER_02\n...always with a universal remote.\n\n0:17:54\tSPEAKER_02\n You have to choose a code.\n\n0:17:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Which type of television you have.\n\n0:17:58\tSPEAKER_02\n There's no problem.\n\n0:18:00\tSPEAKER_02\n I think the two pages on the same screen, like teletext and normal television, that's nowadays standard.\n\n0:18:08\tSPEAKER_03\n I think the most people will buy the remote control because they lost the first one.\n\n0:18:18\tSPEAKER_03\n The first one is broken.\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Perhaps they have a better television.\n\n0:18:25\tSPEAKER_03\n So that option is not...\n\n0:18:28\tSPEAKER_03\n...optional for those people.\n\n0:18:30\tSPEAKER_01\n If you look into the future, then they want to...\n\n0:18:36\tSPEAKER_03\n...experience the phone.\n\n0:18:39\tSPEAKER_03\n So we should take that in consideration.\n\n0:18:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, well, any more ideas?\n\n0:18:45\tSPEAKER_03\n No.\n\n0:18:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Think I'll come up.\n\n0:18:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, yeah, well, we have some time.\n\n0:18:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's see, what more I have to tell you.\n\n0:18:56\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't think there's much left.\n\n0:18:58\tSPEAKER_00\n We're starting to close.\n\n0:19:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Our next meeting will start with a little bit early, but our next meeting will start in 30 minutes.\n\n0:19:05\tSPEAKER_00\n In the meantime, there's time for some individual actions.\n\n0:19:11\tSPEAKER_00\n As you can see, the different roles have different tasks.\n\n0:19:16\tSPEAKER_00\n And there's a ping.\n\n0:19:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Is it my laptop?\n\n0:19:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Stop the meeting.\n\n0:19:24\tSPEAKER_00\n We'll close it in five minutes and the
