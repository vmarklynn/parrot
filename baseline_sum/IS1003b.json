For example, I don't know, here, escape, you know, you have escape in computers, so if you see escape, you know that it should be the same.\n\n0:05:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, it should, okay.\n\n0:05:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:44\tSPEAKER_02\n So the user should know.\n\n0:05:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:46\tSPEAKER_02\n The user is the user there.\n\n0:05:47\tSPEAKER_02\n For example, the power of button, it is something really international.\n\n0:05:51\tSPEAKER_00\n You know that.\n\n0:05:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, and such as maybe the go on, go back.\n\n0:05:57\tSPEAKER_02\n But the question is how to merge, you know, the Google system to the system, or if not.\n\n0:06:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that's my goal.\n\n0:06:03\tSPEAKER_01\n That's your goal.\n\n0:06:04\tSPEAKER_02\n That's your goal.\n\n0:06:05\tSPEAKER_03\n That's my goal.\n\n0:06:06\tSPEAKER_03\n It's not easy, it's my goal.\n\n0:06:08\tSPEAKER_00\n So you will propose something which is, yeah, so powerful and easy to use.\n\n0:06:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:06:17\tSPEAKER_03\n The power of one, the easy to use.\n\n0:06:18\tSPEAKER_03\n So that's the point.\n\n0:06:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:06:20\tSPEAKER_00\n So next, I propose the industrial is going to face to present things.\n\n0:06:26\tSPEAKER_00\n So you're...\n\n0:06:29\tSPEAKER_02\n That's the control.\n\n0:06:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Two.\n\n0:06:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:32\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:06:33\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:06:34\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:06:35\tNone\n Wait a minute.\n\n0:06:36\tNone\n Bye bye.\n\n0:06:37\tSPEAKER_00\n So actually, you know, so...\n\n0:06:40\tNone\n Bye bye, you see.\n\n0:06:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Industry or...\n\n0:06:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Design.\n\n0:06:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Well.\n\n0:06:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Designer.\n\n0:06:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:06:47\tSPEAKER_00\n So you can move to the next slide.\n\n0:06:49\tSPEAKER_02\n As you all know, you know, my job is to design, you know, to give an industrial design of the remote control.\n\n0:07:04\tSPEAKER_02\n So the basic laser remote control will be, you know, infrared control.\n\n0:07:08\tSPEAKER_02\n So the problem is how to relate the...\n\n0:07:13\tSPEAKER_02\n How to relate the remote control device like, for example, this one I'm holding in my hand and the TV.\n\n0:07:19\tSPEAKER_02\n So this one is laser based.\n\n0:07:22\tSPEAKER_02\n But...\n\n0:07:23\tSPEAKER_02\n I propose a infrared infrared based.\n\n0:07:27\tSPEAKER_02\n So for me, I think that it is better...\n\n0:07:34\tSPEAKER_02\n It's better to control TV.\n\n0:07:38\tSPEAKER_02\n So it will be cheaper and it is less technology than...\n\n0:07:43\tSPEAKER_02\n For the cheap price we have, for the cheap price we want.\n\n0:07:46\tSPEAKER_00\n So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology?\n\n0:07:49\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's cheaper than laser.\n\n0:07:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:07:53\tSPEAKER_00\n So the requirements for the remote control 12 nearly 13...\n\n0:07:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:00\tSPEAKER_02\n I think for the cost we want.\n\n0:08:04\tSPEAKER_02\n It's better to have...\n\n0:08:08\tSPEAKER_02\n So you can move to the next slide.\n\n0:08:11\tSPEAKER_02\n So the findings, you know, what you will find inside the system here, it is just, you know, a bulb and an infrared bulb.\n\n0:08:21\tSPEAKER_02\n For example, the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside.\n\n0:08:28\tSPEAKER_02\n That manages.\n\n0:08:29\tSPEAKER_02\n You can go to the next slide.\n\n0:08:30\tSPEAKER_02\n I have some kind of pictures, you know, here.\n\n0:08:34\tSPEAKER_02\n You have the bulb, it is the blue stuff here.\n\n0:08:39\tSPEAKER_02\n And the infrared bulb, it is the right stuff here.\n\n0:08:44\tSPEAKER_02\n And so...\n\n0:08:45\tSPEAKER_02\n And you have the other subcomponent that are not really here.\n\n0:08:48\tSPEAKER_02\n So important.\n\n0:08:50\tSPEAKER_00\n What is this?\n\n0:08:52\tSPEAKER_02\n This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical device.\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:08:58\tSPEAKER_02\n But here what I wanted to emphasize is just, you know, the bulb end.\n\n0:09:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:09:04\tSPEAKER_02\n So and the next slide, it is the last one.\n\n0:09:07\tSPEAKER_02\n So it's...\n\n0:09:09\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it should be why...\n\n0:09:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Why, let's say, the remote control...\n\n0:09:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Because, you know, it's easier to manage.\n\n0:09:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Because if the battery problem can hold, you know, we use the battery or the wire to connect it to you.\n\n0:09:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Or maybe some kind of things that we can have both.\n\n0:09:26\tSPEAKER_02\n But, you know, I have myself prefer a wireless.\n\n0:09:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:09:31\tSPEAKER_02\n If you have some question, I didn't answer.\n\n0:09:37\tSPEAKER_01\n What's the average price of this technology then?\n\n0:09:40\tSPEAKER_02\n The average price is...\n\n0:09:43\tSPEAKER_02\n I think that this technology costs around 8 euros.\n\n0:09:48\tSPEAKER_02\n So only, you know, there...\n\n0:09:51\tSPEAKER_03\n So what the wireless remote control?\n\n0:09:54\tSPEAKER_03\n There's the wire with remote control.\n\n0:09:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:10:00\tSPEAKER_02\n You can...\n\n0:10:01\tSPEAKER_02\n It's...\n\n0:10:02\tSPEAKER_02\n So probably you have to decide how you will, you know, put some energy inside.\n\n0:10:06\tSPEAKER_02\n So you can think about wireless.\n\n0:10:09\tSPEAKER_02\n You know, it's a question that we can realize to...\n\n0:10:13\tSPEAKER_02\n We can think that, you know, with the wire, without wire.\n\n0:10:16\tSPEAKER_02\n We can have both, or so.\n\n0:10:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:10:20\tSPEAKER_00\n So you think that...\n\n0:10:23\tSPEAKER_00\n I can't hold between the remote control.\n\n0:10:28\tSPEAKER_00\n And the TV...\n\n0:10:30\tSPEAKER_00\n One TV could, I think.\n\n0:10:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:10:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Now it may be a TV cheaper.\n\n0:10:37\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:10:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe making...\n\n0:10:41\tSPEAKER_01\n But this is what you would like to ask the user first.\n\n0:10:44\tSPEAKER_01\n And I don't think the user would be ready to have a...\n\n0:10:50\tSPEAKER_03\n...party booth control.\n\n0:10:54\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think it would work.\n\n0:10:57\tSPEAKER_02\n I always want to have, you know, sometimes I want to have wire...\n\n0:11:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but as an industrial designer, do you think that it will be feasible to have a link or do you have a link between the remote control and the TV?\n\n0:11:11\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm just asking you, do you think it will be cheaper?\n\n0:11:16\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think it will be.\n\n0:11:20\tSPEAKER_04\n Could you answer me?\n\n0:11:26\tSPEAKER_04\n It's...\n\n0:11:30\tSPEAKER_02\n I have to think about the question, you know.\n\n0:11:34\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it...\n\n0:11:35\tSPEAKER_02\n You know, you can always, you know.\n\n0:11:39\tSPEAKER_02\n I think with the wire it's cheaper, but, you know, the wire less...\n\n0:11:44\tSPEAKER_02\n...it's more practical.\n\n0:11:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but I think the wireless problem is more the...\n\n0:11:50\tSPEAKER_00\n...David Jordan's problem.\n\n0:11:53\tSPEAKER_00\n As it's...\n\n0:11:54\tSPEAKER_00\n The wire?\n\n0:11:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:56\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's more your problem.\n\n0:11:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe you have just to...\n\n0:12:00\tSPEAKER_00\n...to kind of research or try to ask people if they would like something wireless or not.\n\n0:12:07\tSPEAKER_00\n That's my job.\n\n0:12:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, I'm sorry.\n\n0:12:11\tSPEAKER_02\n No, no.\n\n0:12:12\tSPEAKER_02\n But it should be an agreement, you know, because even if you can't think of the wire, it is the job of the...\n\n0:12:20\tSPEAKER_02\n...the graphical user design, but, you know, if it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach, for example, some... the money we have if you want to use it, it can be good to have a wireless...\n\n0:12:34\tSPEAKER_02\n It is a question.\n\n0:12:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, right, so...\n\n0:12:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Just think of the user design.\n\n0:12:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I'll wire this remote controller.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Just think of the problem if when you have wireless remote control, and if you lose it, I think it would be easier to have the link between the remote control.\n\n0:12:53\tSPEAKER_00\n I think one of the points, yeah.\n\n0:12:55\tSPEAKER_01\n True. This you will see in my presentation then.\n\n0:12:58\tSPEAKER_00\n So I will let you...\n\n0:13:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:13:01\tSPEAKER_00\n...to your presentation.\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Which is participant 4.\n\n0:13:10\tSPEAKER_01\n So just trying to answer all the questions.\n\n0:13:13\tSPEAKER_01\n If the user would be happy to have something else, we've made a study.\n\n0:13:19\tSPEAKER_01\n So could you go to the next slide, sorry, for the function requirements.\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_01\n So that's the standard method for marketing.\n\n0:13:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, we have 100 subjects.\n\n0:13:29\tSPEAKER_01\n We observe their remote control use in a lab, and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire and see what was okay or not for them.\n\n0:13:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:13:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:13:44\tSPEAKER_01\n So then it's some statistics about what we observe then what they answered.\n\n0:13:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Actually 75% of the users find the most remote controls are ugly.\n\n0:13:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:13:56\tSPEAKER_01\n So that...\n\n0:13:57\tSPEAKER_00\n You mean the look?\n\n0:13:59\tSPEAKER_00\n The look?\n\n0:14:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, the look is bad to them, so it's your job, David, maybe.\n\n0:14:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Then 80% of users would spend more money.\n\n0:14:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Actually, if the remote controls were not so ugly, so this is where we could have...\n\n0:14:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, good market, I guess.\n\n0:14:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:20\tSPEAKER_01\n If people are ready to pay more, so it's interesting information, I think.\n\n0:14:25\tSPEAKER_01\n And then...\n\n0:14:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, the remote controls, like the one you've shown previously, it's not so...\n\n0:14:35\tSPEAKER_01\n It doesn't fit the user requirements sometimes, because it's too many buttons and so on.\n\n0:14:39\tSPEAKER_01\n So we should change this as well, and...\n\n0:14:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Users are actually zapping a lot, so they are using the device intensively.\n\n0:14:49\tSPEAKER_01\n That's something to take into account as well.\n\n0:14:51\tSPEAKER_01\n And, you know, 10% of the buttons are actually used in our remote controls.\n\n0:14:57\tSPEAKER_01\n And this is one of the main points for me, but I'll come back to it later.\n\n0:15:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:15:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Could you go to the next slide?\n\n0:15:08\tSPEAKER_01\n So as you said, remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room.\n\n0:15:13\tSPEAKER_01\n So this is from the experiments we've done.\n\n0:15:16\tSPEAKER_01\n So if we could solve this problem, this would be interesting for the user, I think.\n\n0:15:22\tSPEAKER_01\n It takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for 35% of the people.\n\n0:15:29\tSPEAKER_01\n And the remote control are really bad for AI problems for 26% of the users.\n\n0:15:37\tSPEAKER_00\n What is RSI?\n\n0:15:39\tSPEAKER_01\n RSI is like, when you're using the same...\n\n0:15:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Doing the same moment several times, then you get injured.\n\n0:15:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:15:49\tSPEAKER_01\n So those numbers are less important than the previous one, but still it has to be taken into account.\n\n0:15:55\tSPEAKER_01\n So last slide.\n\n0:15:59\tSPEAKER_01\n So my personal preference is for this problem is we have to meet the user needs.\n\n0:16:06\tSPEAKER_01\n If we can make it look fancy, then we might sell more than our concurrent.\n\n0:16:13\tSPEAKER_01\n And definitely if you could have less buttons, still maybe the same number of functions, but less buttons.\n\n0:16:22\tSPEAKER_01\n This would definitely be a good way of selling more.\n\n0:16:27\tSPEAKER_00\n So...\n\n0:16:30\tSPEAKER_00\n And just to have an idea, do you think you as the user interface designer, it would be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control?\n\n0:16:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Do you think it's possible?\n\n0:16:47\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's possible.\n\n0:16:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Because you can mix several functions in one button.\n\n0:16:57\tSPEAKER_03\n So that you have less buttons.\n\n0:17:00\tSPEAKER_00\n But you think it will be easy to use, because if you have many functions just for one button, it would be quite difficult for the user to know.\n\n0:17:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Remember the user is not happy to read the manual.\n\n0:17:14\tSPEAKER_03\n You can have a speech menu, so you can...\n\n0:17:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Yep, it has to be intuitive.\n\n0:17:21\tSPEAKER_03\n For example, you can category into several classes.\n\n0:17:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Then you can have a speech menu.\n\n0:17:36\tSPEAKER_03\n So you put a speech menu, it tends to this category of functions.\n\n0:17:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Then you put the speech button, then it switches to another category of functions.\n\n0:17:52\tSPEAKER_03\n For example, if you have reboot control, you can control your TV, and also you can control your recorder.\n\n0:18:00\tSPEAKER_03\n So there's different functions, but if there's a button, you can switch between control TV and control recorder.\n\n0:18:10\tSPEAKER_03\n So you can have less buttons.\n\n0:18:13\tSPEAKER_03\n But you have not to worry about how to make the remote control look funny.\n\n0:18:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Look fancy.\n\n0:18:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Not fancy.\n\n0:18:19\tSPEAKER_02\n This is a question that should be asked to the...\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_03\n If the people have different opinion about fancy, you know.\n\n0:18:25\tSPEAKER_02\n If you ask the people maybe, the market people are worried about...\n\n0:18:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, this is something we wish.\n\n0:18:30\tSPEAKER_03\n It'd be a colorful, it's fancy for some people, but maybe simple.\n\n0:18:35\tSPEAKER_03\n But this was first step, then.\n\n0:18:40\tSPEAKER_02\n This was a question that many colors of...\n\n0:18:43\tSPEAKER_02\n You know, instead of having one grade...\n\n0:18:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but I think it will increase the price of the production.\n\n0:18:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Are the remote control.\n\n0:18:52\tSPEAKER_00\n If you need to have special colors for remote controls, it will cost more.\n\n0:18:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it's a nice color because...\n\n0:18:59\tSPEAKER_03\n It will cost a little bit more.\n\n0:19:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but this is what we would ask to the users.\n\n0:19:10\tSPEAKER_03\n And also we can have several options, so user can select which color they prefer.\n\n0:19:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but as soon as you speak about options, it means that the price increases.\n\n0:19:21\tSPEAKER_00\n And we don't really want the price to be too high, because we won't be able to produce it.\n\n0:19:27\tSPEAKER_00\n So we want something fancy, as previously said, Flore.\n\n0:19:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Something very easy to use, powerful.\n\n0:19:36\tSPEAKER_00\n And also, it's written here, 75% of users, they zap a lot.\n\n0:19:42\tSPEAKER_00\n So maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot.\n\n0:19:50\tSPEAKER_00\n They don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control.\n\n0:19:54\tSPEAKER_00\n They want to zap between channels on TV.\n\n0:20:00\tSPEAKER_00\n I think you have quite a lot of points to think about and discuss with the other members.\n\n0:20:08\tSPEAKER_00\n So is it okay for your presentation?\n\n0:20:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Nothing else to add?\n\n0:20:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, if we could remember not too many buttons and make it look fancy, I think it would like it.\n\n0:20:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:20:25\tSPEAKER_00\n So...\n\n0:20:29\tSPEAKER_00\n So I had some new information about the project requirements, so you will have to take care of it in your thinking, your designing of the remote control.\n\n0:20:43\tSPEAKER_00\n So the first one is that for the designing of the remote control, we don't really want to use the teletext anymore, as it's something that is...\n\n0:20:56\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:20:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, because now everybody has internet at home, so it's better to use internet than teletext.\n\n0:21:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:09\tSPEAKER_00\n So you will have to think about it in the design of your remote control.\n\n0:21:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Also, the remote control will only be used for television, so for your designing, you won't be...\n\n0:21:24\tSPEAKER_00\n You won't have buttons to manipulate, you have to control the recorder or maybe the garage door of things like that.\n\n0:21:35\tSPEAKER_00\n It's... because if we want to do a remote control, which will be used for the television, for the recorder, for the camcorder, and all the others, it will become too complex and it will increase the price, and we can't do that.\n\n0:21:53\tSPEAKER_00\n We really want to focus on the remote control for the television.\n\n0:21:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:21:58\tSPEAKER_03\n But there's a balance between...\n\n0:22:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe it will be easier for you to design it, to have very powerful and easy, and also want the image of the real reaction, be recognizable in the product, such as the color and the slugging.\n\n0:22:19\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, that's if you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop, and if you see the remote control, you will recognize directly that it's our product.\n\n0:22:31\tSPEAKER_00\n So you will have to use the color of the product, of the...\n\n0:22:42\tSPEAKER_00\n of the real reaction.\n\n0:22:45\tSPEAKER_00\n And also...\n\n0:22:48\tSPEAKER_01\n So it has to be yellow.\n\n0:22:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, yellow.\n\n0:22:51\tSPEAKER_00\n So we say we put fashion in electronics, so it has to be a fashion remote control, fancy fashion, powerful, easy to use, quite a lot of requirements.\n\n0:23:02\tSPEAKER_02\n For cheap remote control, cheap.\n\n0:23:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:06\tSPEAKER_03\n A low cost.\n\n0:23:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:08\tSPEAKER_00\n But that's your job to find something...\n\n0:23:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:13\tSPEAKER_02\n What I'm thinking is how you will connect the TV to internet.\n\n0:23:17\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't think it's part of the remote control design.\n\n0:23:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe not, but it will be more in browsing.\n\n0:23:24\tSPEAKER_02\n But this means that your TV will be able to connect to internet, you know, serve the world.\n\n0:23:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:31\tSPEAKER_03\n There are setboxes in the TV, so with the setbox, you can connect it to that, it's your TV.\n\n0:23:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:23:43\tSPEAKER_03\n But it's now so popular now.\n\n0:23:48\tSPEAKER_02\n It's popular, I don't think it's popular, because that's the problem.\n\n0:23:51\tSPEAKER_02\n And you are designing a remote control for, you know, the global usage.\n\n0:23:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:23:58\tSPEAKER_02\n So if people don't have the technology, so...\n\n0:24:01\tSPEAKER_00\n So...\n\n0:24:10\tSPEAKER_00\n So everybody's okay with the new requirements?\n\n0:24:21\tSPEAKER_03\n I thought the color...\n\n0:24:23\tSPEAKER_03\n What do you think?\n\n0:24:25\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it has to be yellow.\n\n0:24:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Yellow?\n\n0:24:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:29\tSPEAKER_03\n I think that people like the color yellow.\n\n0:24:32\tSPEAKER_00\n The remote control.\n\n0:24:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe you can change the color.\n\n0:24:35\tSPEAKER_00\n But the image of the society has to be recognized.\n\n0:24:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:24:40\tSPEAKER_02\n I think if you have, you know, like a yellow ribbon here, it has to be a fashion.\n\n0:24:46\tSPEAKER_00\n So you have to...\n\n0:24:47\tSPEAKER_02\n It doesn't need to be completely yellow, but just...\n\n0:24:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:51\tSPEAKER_00\n It has to be a fashion and really be the image of the society.\n\n0:24:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Just when you enter and say, oh, it's a real reaction.\n\n0:24:59\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's a real reaction.\n\n0:25:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Remote control.\n\n0:25:02\tSPEAKER_00\n And also it has to be attractive, of course, because if you want to sell the remote control.\n\n0:25:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:25:12\tSPEAKER_00\n It's okay.\n\n0:25:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Regarding the first line, what...\n\n0:25:16\tSPEAKER_01\n So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext.\n\n0:25:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:21\tSPEAKER_01\n And that's it.\n\n0:25:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:23\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know what Y is, no more use of that.\n\n0:25:28\tSPEAKER_01\n So what would it change for?\n\n0:25:31\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it would be simpler.\n\n0:25:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:25:38\tSPEAKER_00\n So...\n\n0:25:42\tSPEAKER_00\n I will close the meeting.\n\n0:25:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Just after that, we'll have lunch break.\n\n0:25:49\tSPEAKER_00\n And you will have in 30 minutes of individual work.\n\n0:25:56\tSPEAKER_00\n You...\n\n0:26:00\tSPEAKER_00\n You will have as the IT I don't remember what is...\n\n0:26:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Industrial design.\n\n0:26:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Industrial design.\n\n0:26:05\tSPEAKER_00\n To put...\n\n0:26:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Compound on it.\n\n0:26:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:09\tSPEAKER_00\n And the user interface designer to work on the user interface concepts.\n\n0:26:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Thank you.\n\n0:26:15\tSPEAKER_00\n And through home to work on a subject.\n\n0:26:20\tSPEAKER_04\n Yep.\n\n0:26:21\tSPEAKER_00\n And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach.\n\n0:26:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:26:29\tSPEAKER_00\n It's okay.\n\n0:26:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:31\tSPEAKER_00\n I think the session is closed.\n\n0:26:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:26:34\tNone\n Thank you.\n\n0:26:39\tSPEAKER_00\n And by the way, Mr. David Jordan, please record your presentations in your own...\n\n0:26:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:26:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Not in mine.\n\n0:26:46\tSPEAKER_00\n To be better.\n\n0:26:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:26:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:26:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:26:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Thank you.\n\n0:26:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Thank you.\n\n0:26:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:26:53\tNone\n That was a funny
