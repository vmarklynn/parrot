Excellent.\n\n0:00:44\tSPEAKER_00\n And you are a new user interface.\n\n0:00:46\tSPEAKER_01\n New user interface designer.\n\n0:00:48\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm going to look at the technical design from the user point of view.\n\n0:00:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Excellent.\n\n0:00:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:00:54\tSPEAKER_03\n My name is Xavier J\u00c3\u00b6rgens.\n\n0:00:58\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm the industrial designer.\n\n0:01:00\tSPEAKER_03\n And there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today.\n\n0:01:04\tSPEAKER_03\n First one is what happens inside the apparatus.\n\n0:01:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Second is what is the apparatus made of and the third is what should it look like.\n\n0:01:10\tSPEAKER_00\n What should it look like?\n\n0:01:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:01:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's kick it off.\n\n0:01:14\tSPEAKER_00\n There we go.\n\n0:01:15\tSPEAKER_00\n So our new product is about we need designer remote control for television set.\n\n0:01:21\tSPEAKER_00\n So which has to be original, trying to end user friendly.\n\n0:01:24\tSPEAKER_00\n I took this off corporate website.\n\n0:01:26\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that sums up what we need to do.\n\n0:01:28\tSPEAKER_00\n We're inspired by the latest fashion only in electronics but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design.\n\n0:01:34\tSPEAKER_00\n That's why our project will always fit in your home.\n\n0:01:36\tSPEAKER_00\n So apparently we need to be very open to what's currently hot in the market.\n\n0:01:43\tSPEAKER_00\n So that's what you need to do to bring us latest info on what people want.\n\n0:01:48\tSPEAKER_00\n So we put the fashion electronics so that's what we need to go for.\n\n0:01:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Anyway, we'll take this project in three steps.\n\n0:01:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Three phase of design.\n\n0:01:56\tSPEAKER_00\n First step will be the functional design.\n\n0:01:58\tSPEAKER_00\n And this is basically what we're going to do.\n\n0:02:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Everybody has a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards so we can share information about it.\n\n0:02:04\tSPEAKER_00\n So I'm going to keep the shorts and write a technical problem.\n\n0:02:07\tSPEAKER_00\n So skip through this.\n\n0:02:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:02:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Every meeting we, everybody can present their views and everything.\n\n0:02:16\tSPEAKER_00\n So to help with these, we have the smart boards here.\n\n0:02:19\tSPEAKER_00\n You can use a regular PowerPoint presentation.\n\n0:02:22\tSPEAKER_00\n And so both of us give you an introduction on this dueling board.\n\n0:02:26\tSPEAKER_00\n So it's actually very easy.\n\n0:02:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Like it says, very simple.\n\n0:02:30\tSPEAKER_00\n You just take out the pen.\n\n0:02:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Like you see here.\n\n0:02:33\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll just take the tool over here.\n\n0:02:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Sit.\n\n0:02:37\tSPEAKER_00\n You just put it on the board.\n\n0:02:39\tSPEAKER_00\n You see a pen here.\n\n0:02:41\tSPEAKER_00\n You go here.\n\n0:02:42\tSPEAKER_00\n You just select using a pen.\n\n0:02:44\tSPEAKER_00\n You can just draw whatever you want.\n\n0:02:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Select your eraser.\n\n0:02:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Interace whatever you want.\n\n0:02:51\tSPEAKER_00\n And so it's will be easy to just illustrate your views.\n\n0:02:55\tSPEAKER_00\n If you want to change the format, either take, oh, you select the pen.\n\n0:03:01\tSPEAKER_00\n And whatever you want.\n\n0:03:03\tSPEAKER_00\n You're current color, the line width.\n\n0:03:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Just to make the line bigger.\n\n0:03:08\tSPEAKER_00\n So that's super easy.\n\n0:03:09\tSPEAKER_00\n It's just to take the, just take a new slide and back again.\n\n0:03:14\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm just going to keep using this board all the time.\n\n0:03:17\tSPEAKER_00\n So I think it will be, it's very clear for everyone I suppose.\n\n0:03:20\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm going to take this out.\n\n0:03:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:03:25\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm going to use that later anyway.\n\n0:03:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, just, just, this stuff that you want to share.\n\n0:03:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Just put it in the, in the project folder.\n\n0:03:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Like I put my presentation now.\n\n0:03:35\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll put the, the minutes of every meeting.\n\n0:03:37\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll put them there too.\n\n0:03:39\tSPEAKER_00\n So everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever.\n\n0:03:42\tSPEAKER_00\n So next, I've been here.\n\n0:03:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, I'm going to give the electronic whiteboard a shot.\n\n0:03:49\tSPEAKER_00\n So basic ideas.\n\n0:03:52\tSPEAKER_00\n We have a blank sheet.\n\n0:03:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Just try whatever you want.\n\n0:03:56\tSPEAKER_00\n And like it says, draw your favorite animal.\n\n0:04:00\tSPEAKER_00\n I think the creative genius should go first.\n\n0:04:03\tSPEAKER_00\n The creative genius, thank you very much.\n\n0:04:06\tSPEAKER_00\n So draw your favorite animal.\n\n0:04:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing.\n\n0:04:11\tSPEAKER_01\n So I'm not really good at drawing animals.\n\n0:04:14\tSPEAKER_01\n But the animal which I pretty much, oh, still the racing.\n\n0:04:18\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm a pen.\n\n0:04:21\tSPEAKER_01\n I have four more.\n\n0:04:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Where else my animal will be like, king side.\n\n0:04:28\tSPEAKER_01\n I pretty much like a dolphin.\n\n0:04:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Because if it's freedom basically, let's see.\n\n0:04:38\tSPEAKER_01\n The head.\n\n0:04:42\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't actually work with this.\n\n0:04:44\tSPEAKER_01\n It's like a very high tech.\n\n0:04:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Bit low response of though.\n\n0:04:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Prefer pen and paper.\n\n0:04:53\tSPEAKER_00\n So that's what we don't want.\n\n0:04:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Want the high responsive products.\n\n0:04:57\tSPEAKER_01\n It looks like a nuclear bomb.\n\n0:05:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Doesn't look like a nuclear bomb.\n\n0:05:04\tSPEAKER_01\n This thing isn't doing what I'm.\n\n0:05:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's go easy on it.\n\n0:05:14\tSPEAKER_01\n It does look like a nuclear bomb.\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_01\n I'll just finish up real soon.\n\n0:05:22\tSPEAKER_01\n So it doesn't really look like a dolphin.\n\n0:05:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Anyway, this is all new from the first read of the often.\n\n0:05:36\tSPEAKER_00\n You like the freedom that it represents.\n\n0:05:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Like the ocean, like swimming.\n\n0:05:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Do that in my spare time.\n\n0:05:42\tSPEAKER_01\n So that's basically it.\n\n0:05:44\tSPEAKER_00\n What'd you like?\n\n0:05:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, now we can forget the seven-hub and show us an animal.\n\n0:05:51\tSPEAKER_02\n I like the elephant.\n\n0:05:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Take a clean sheet.\n\n0:05:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Take a clean sheet.\n\n0:06:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Press next.\n\n0:06:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Or a blank.\n\n0:06:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Free.\n\n0:06:05\tSPEAKER_02\n I like the elephant.\n\n0:06:06\tSPEAKER_02\n It's big.\n\n0:06:07\tSPEAKER_02\n It's strong.\n\n0:06:08\tSPEAKER_02\n So.\n\n0:06:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, it's a little bit.\n\n0:06:13\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not.\n\n0:06:14\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a little bit.\n\n0:06:23\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a beautiful animal.\n\n0:06:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, you have to press it pretty hard.\n\n0:06:37\tSPEAKER_02\n With a smile on it.\n\n0:06:39\tSPEAKER_02\n It's very important.\n\n0:06:40\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a cute elephant.\n\n0:06:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:55\tSPEAKER_02\n And not forget it's still.\n\n0:07:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, it's a nice beard.\n\n0:07:04\tSPEAKER_02\n No, it's okay.\n\n0:07:08\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm making comments on my dolphins.\n\n0:07:11\tSPEAKER_02\n I will beat the dolphin.\n\n0:07:14\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:07:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so it's just to be.\n\n0:07:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:18\tSPEAKER_00\n So I suggest you make us the elephant in the market.\n\n0:07:20\tSPEAKER_00\n The big and strong player in the market.\n\n0:07:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:23\tSPEAKER_00\n That's gonna be good.\n\n0:07:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, excellent.\n\n0:07:26\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll enter the next one.\n\n0:07:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:07:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, you should press next.\n\n0:07:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Next, yeah.\n\n0:07:35\tSPEAKER_00\n It's up there.\n\n0:07:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:07:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, well, the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger.\n\n0:07:45\tSPEAKER_01\n You picked a hard one, didn't you?\n\n0:07:50\tSPEAKER_03\n It's my drawing skills already.\n\n0:07:54\tSPEAKER_02\n What?\n\n0:07:55\tSPEAKER_02\n They are.\n\n0:07:56\tSPEAKER_03\n They are really bad.\n\n0:07:57\tSPEAKER_02\n My drawing skills.\n\n0:07:58\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:07:59\tNone\n I'm sure it looks smooth.\n\n0:08:13\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm not sure how to make sure to do it.\n\n0:08:28\tSPEAKER_03\n These are stripes.\n\n0:08:35\tSPEAKER_03\n I've picked this animal because it's very fast.\n\n0:08:42\tSPEAKER_03\n It is, it knows exactly what it wants.\n\n0:08:45\tSPEAKER_03\n It hardly ever waces any resources.\n\n0:08:47\tSPEAKER_03\n What does it want?\n\n0:08:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, basically, it hunts for prey.\n\n0:08:52\tSPEAKER_03\n But it does it always in a very well thought way.\n\n0:08:55\tSPEAKER_03\n It knows exactly what it wants.\n\n0:08:58\tSPEAKER_03\n It never kills an animal just for the killing.\n\n0:09:01\tSPEAKER_03\n So it's very efficient and it tries to do everything as fast as possible.\n\n0:09:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:09:05\tSPEAKER_03\n And it always goes for security in seeking hide spots and doing everything.\n\n0:09:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Security, speed and efficiency is important.\n\n0:09:14\tSPEAKER_03\n And I think that it's great.\n\n0:09:16\tSPEAKER_03\n And things we can do.\n\n0:09:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:09:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Yay, I'm supposed to draw the animal next.\n\n0:09:24\tSPEAKER_00\n I introduced it to the world of the amazing ant.\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Hard worker.\n\n0:09:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Great team workers.\n\n0:09:42\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:09:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Do everything really small but together.\n\n0:09:45\tSPEAKER_00\n It's really strong.\n\n0:09:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:47\tSPEAKER_00\n You have to smiley face.\n\n0:09:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Not sure where the six pod or the just put them here, whatever.\n\n0:10:01\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it needs shoes.\n\n0:10:26\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's a cool thing.\n\n0:10:32\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a cool thing.\n\n0:10:33\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a cool thing.\n\n0:10:35\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a cool thing.\n\n0:10:38\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a cool thing.\n\n0:10:39\tSPEAKER_00\n You've done this before.\n\n0:10:40\tSPEAKER_00\n I love to draw.\n\n0:10:41\tSPEAKER_00\n It's my hobby.\n\n0:10:42\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's very representative of what we drew.\n\n0:10:45\tSPEAKER_00\n I guess.\n\n0:10:46\tSPEAKER_00\n You take your free and use a trendy interface.\n\n0:10:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:56\tSPEAKER_00\n You're supposed to make it different from what other people have and make it a little distinct.\n\n0:11:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Anyway.\n\n0:11:02\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it has another beat to stop the meeting.\n\n0:11:06\tSPEAKER_00\n See.\n\n0:11:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Warning.\n\n0:11:08\tNone\n Finish meeting now.\n\n0:11:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Put this down.\n\n0:11:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Exactly.\n\n0:11:11\tSPEAKER_00\n As well.\n\n0:11:12\tSPEAKER_00\n I guess we have a little time extra on it.\n\n0:11:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Just a little quick discussion to open our work.\n\n0:11:20\tSPEAKER_00\n What do you guys think about the first ideas is very short.\n\n0:11:23\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll start with you.\n\n0:11:24\tSPEAKER_00\n What are your first ideas for new products?\n\n0:11:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I basically had a question.\n\n0:11:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Are you going to introduce a multi remote control?\n\n0:11:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Is it just the TV or do we want to?\n\n0:11:33\tSPEAKER_00\n The project I got was just for TV remote control.\n\n0:11:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Just for TV remote control.\n\n0:11:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_01\n I guess.\n\n0:11:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I was thinking about design remote control with our motto and all.\n\n0:11:44\tSPEAKER_01\n The thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with.\n\n0:11:50\tSPEAKER_01\n No rational changes or whatever.\n\n0:11:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:11:54\tSPEAKER_00\n So very intuitive design.\n\n0:11:55\tSPEAKER_00\n I guess.\n\n0:11:56\tSPEAKER_01\n We might have to consider other design aspects of our product.\n\n0:12:02\tSPEAKER_01\n So that was something I wanted to add.\n\n0:12:06\tSPEAKER_01\n And perhaps some usability aspect TV is becoming central in most homes.\n\n0:12:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Do we want people who are disabled in any way to be able to use it as well?\n\n0:12:18\tSPEAKER_00\n I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it.\n\n0:12:21\tSPEAKER_00\n I think really disabled people might be a problem.\n\n0:12:26\tSPEAKER_00\n But I think it's a little thing to take into consideration.\n\n0:12:30\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we really need to cut the meeting short.\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Anything you want to share quickly?\n\n0:12:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Only one thing that has to be an as according to me is the material it is made of.\n\n0:12:41\tSPEAKER_03\n It should be something light.\n\n0:12:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Speak to itself.\n\n0:12:44\tSPEAKER_03\n It should be light.\n\n0:12:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:12:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's see where did I skip that.\n\n0:12:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, this is it.\n\n0:12:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Sorry, skip this sheet.\n\n0:12:51\tSPEAKER_00\n What do we, this quick, what we're going to selling price 25 euros.\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_00\n That's for you, the production price 12 and a half euros.\n\n0:12:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Approximately just go for that and we'll reach you.\n\n0:13:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Reach that profit.\n\n0:13:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, that's not much to look at.\n\n0:13:05\tSPEAKER_00\n No, it's not much to work with.\n\n0:13:06\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm sorry, I skipped it.\n\n0:13:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Anyway, it's, yeah, this is it.\n\n0:13:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Do you have anything you, you came up with yet about marketing transfer or whatever?\n\n0:13:16\tSPEAKER_00\n About what?\n\n0:13:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Marketing?\n\n0:13:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Marketing transfer.\n\n0:13:19\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not sure what you came up with yet.\n\n0:13:20\tSPEAKER_00\n You have anything to share as we'll cut the meeting just.\n\n0:13:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Make sure it's in for a special set.\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_02\n No, not really yet.\n\n0:13:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:13:26\tSPEAKER_02\n I have some ideas and I will.\n\n0:13:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Anyways.\n\n0:13:29\tSPEAKER_00\n So the personal coach will give you the your personal assignments and everything.\n\n0:13:33\tSPEAKER_00\n So we'll just meet back in your 30 minutes.\n\n0:13:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:13:36\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll share it.\n\n0:13:37\tNone\n We have that.\n\n0:13:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Good luck, everyone.\n\n0:13:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, thanks for attending.\n\n0:13:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, I'll see you back in your 30 minutes.\n\n0:13:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:13:43\tNone\n Yes.\n\n0:13:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:14:19\tNone\n Okay.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "It's the first team meeting for the new project.
