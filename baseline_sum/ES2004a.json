Yeah.\n\n0:00:16\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:00:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Am I supposed to be standing up there?\n\n0:00:23\tSPEAKER_01\n So you've got both of these clipped on.\n\n0:00:27\tSPEAKER_01\n She's going to hold on to me.\n\n0:00:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I'll go.\n\n0:00:31\tSPEAKER_01\n This is my birthday.\n\n0:00:34\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:00:42\tNone\n God.\n\n0:00:45\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm just going to fall off.\n\n0:01:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:01:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Hello everybody.\n\n0:01:24\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm Sarah, Project Manager.\n\n0:01:28\tSPEAKER_02\n And this is our first meeting.\n\n0:01:31\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a surprising event.\n\n0:01:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, this is our agenda.\n\n0:01:36\tSPEAKER_02\n We will do some stuff, get to know each other a bit better.\n\n0:01:40\tSPEAKER_02\n We'll come to each other.\n\n0:01:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Then we'll go do two training, talk about the project plan, discuss our own ideas and everything.\n\n0:01:52\tSPEAKER_02\n And we've got 25 minutes to do that as far as I can understand.\n\n0:01:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Now we're developing a welcome approach.\n\n0:02:00\tSPEAKER_02\n You probably already know.\n\n0:02:02\tSPEAKER_02\n We want it to be original.\n\n0:02:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Some people haven't saw it.\n\n0:02:07\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not out in the shops.\n\n0:02:09\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a trendy, appealing to a wide market, but not a hunk of metal.\n\n0:02:15\tSPEAKER_02\n And user-friendly, granny, two kids, maybe even creatures, should be able to use it.\n\n0:02:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:02:24\tSPEAKER_02\n First is the functional design.\n\n0:02:27\tSPEAKER_02\n This is where we all go off into our individual work.\n\n0:02:30\tSPEAKER_02\n What needs need to be fulfilled by the product.\n\n0:02:34\tSPEAKER_02\n What effect the product has to have.\n\n0:02:37\tSPEAKER_02\n And how it's actually going to do that.\n\n0:02:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Conceptual design, what we're thinking, how it's going to go.\n\n0:02:44\tSPEAKER_02\n And then the detailed design, how we're actually going to put it into practice and make it work.\n\n0:02:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:02:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:02:52\tSPEAKER_02\n We're going to practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the whiteboard, our girlfriend.\n\n0:03:00\tSPEAKER_02\n And some of the characteristics of that animal.\n\n0:03:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:03:07\tSPEAKER_02\n And the space for everyone else.\n\n0:03:35\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:03:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:04:07\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm not going to ask you to guess I'm going to tell you that supposed to be a tiger.\n\n0:04:15\tSPEAKER_02\n And I see them as majestic.\n\n0:04:20\tSPEAKER_02\n And independent.\n\n0:04:26\tSPEAKER_02\n And proud.\n\n0:04:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:04:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:04:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:05:06\tSPEAKER_03\n I kind of talk.\n\n0:05:16\tSPEAKER_03\n It's actually sitting.\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_03\n It's not standing.\n\n0:05:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:05:22\tNone\n I see it as one thing.\n\n0:05:23\tSPEAKER_03\n It's very supportive.\n\n0:05:25\tSPEAKER_03\n It's your best friend in you.\n\n0:05:27\tSPEAKER_03\n You can talk to a dog.\n\n0:05:28\tSPEAKER_03\n It can be a best friend.\n\n0:05:29\tSPEAKER_03\n It doesn't discriminate between you based on what you are.\n\n0:05:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Second, it's loyal.\n\n0:05:35\tSPEAKER_03\n And third thing, it's got intuition.\n\n0:05:40\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean dogs can sometimes make out between a thief and a person.\n\n0:05:45\tSPEAKER_03\n So basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog.\n\n0:05:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:05:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Thank you.\n\n0:05:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:05:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Please, please leave me a space at the bottom.\n\n0:05:58\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm a little.\n\n0:05:59\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:06:00\tSPEAKER_01\n We're standing on a chair.\n\n0:06:02\tSPEAKER_00\n I think I'm going to have to change.\n\n0:06:05\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm going to have to change.\n\n0:06:08\tNone\n You can go around them.\n\n0:06:11\tSPEAKER_00\n And also my drawing skill isn't that great.\n\n0:06:15\tSPEAKER_01\n As you can see, the quality of the work today.\n\n0:06:19\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's standing.\n\n0:06:20\tSPEAKER_00\n We're good.\n\n0:06:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:06:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Now I'm going to have to change what it was originally to be.\n\n0:06:25\tNone\n Because that looks like a beak.\n\n0:06:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Crocodile.\n\n0:06:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it can be a crocodile.\n\n0:06:35\tSPEAKER_00\n It can be a crocodile.\n\n0:06:37\tSPEAKER_00\n It was in the first place.\n\n0:06:40\tSPEAKER_00\n It was an attempt to a tea rigs.\n\n0:06:42\tSPEAKER_00\n And then it's sort of changed into a pelican, but it can be a crocodile.\n\n0:07:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:02\tSPEAKER_00\n And I have to think on the spot of things that is scary.\n\n0:07:09\tSPEAKER_00\n A strong.\n\n0:07:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, that's funny.\n\n0:07:20\tSPEAKER_00\n I think I'm going to have to change.\n\n0:07:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:07:23\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm very impressed with your artistic skills.\n\n0:07:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Mine's a dreadful.\n\n0:07:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Oops, this is now coming apart.\n\n0:07:30\tSPEAKER_01\n I just put the top in.\n\n0:07:34\tSPEAKER_01\n I'll put that clicks in.\n\n0:07:35\tSPEAKER_01\n I'll hold it on.\n\n0:07:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Oops.\n\n0:07:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh dear.\n\n0:07:40\tSPEAKER_01\n What happened there?\n\n0:07:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Technical help.\n\n0:07:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Hopefully I'll stay on 200 versions.\n\n0:07:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:07:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:07:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Again, this is off the top of my head.\n\n0:07:56\tSPEAKER_01\n I was going to do a big count too.\n\n0:08:01\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm going to do a big count.\n\n0:08:11\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not a vampire bat, honestly.\n\n0:08:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Somewhere there's a body behind.\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_00\n That's the worst.\n\n0:08:20\tSPEAKER_01\n It's meant to be an eagle.\n\n0:08:22\tSPEAKER_01\n You can tell it's a flying animal.\n\n0:08:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Could have been a seagull.\n\n0:08:27\tSPEAKER_01\n I never thought of a seagull.\n\n0:08:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Again, I'm thinking on my feet.\n\n0:08:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Goodness.\n\n0:08:32\tSPEAKER_01\n I suppose they're also independent.\n\n0:08:33\tSPEAKER_01\n I'll put that one down again.\n\n0:08:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Dada.\n\n0:08:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Um.\n\n0:08:38\tSPEAKER_01\n They're good at golf.\n\n0:08:40\tSPEAKER_01\n They're dependent.\n\n0:08:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Independent, right?\n\n0:08:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Did you say they're good at golf?\n\n0:08:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:45\tSPEAKER_00\n I think.\n\n0:08:46\tSPEAKER_00\n They're good.\n\n0:08:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, right.\n\n0:08:48\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm not good at golf.\n\n0:08:49\tSPEAKER_01\n I'll say they're quite free-spirited.\n\n0:08:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Flying around everywhere.\n\n0:08:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Doing their own thing.\n\n0:08:58\tNone\n And birds of prey, aren't they?\n\n0:09:00\tNone\n Oh dear.\n\n0:09:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Intrappered.\n\n0:09:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Intrappered.\n\n0:09:05\tSPEAKER_01\n There we go.\n\n0:09:07\tSPEAKER_01\n I hope that pen's going to be okay.\n\n0:09:10\tNone\n Whoops.\n\n0:09:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:09:15\tSPEAKER_01\n That was fine.\n\n0:09:17\tNone\n Right.\n\n0:09:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Finance-wise, we've got a lot of money.\n\n0:09:21\tSPEAKER_02\n 17.\n\n0:09:28\tSPEAKER_02\n 17.\n\n0:09:31\tSPEAKER_02\n One point four you know would make a bond or something?\n\n0:09:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, yeah, saying that.\n\n0:09:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, about 17.\n\n0:09:40\tSPEAKER_03\n 17 pounds.\n\n0:09:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Should we be making notes of this?\n\n0:09:44\tSPEAKER_00\n We can just refer to this later.\n\n0:09:46\tSPEAKER_01\n I think so.\n\n0:09:51\tSPEAKER_02\n I'd be able to put the app on a shared folder.\n\n0:09:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Having said that, though, if you want to get one of those, the ones on the market, the moment, that's there about 20 pounds anyway.\n\n0:10:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:10:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we have one.\n\n0:10:08\tSPEAKER_01\n So I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price.\n\n0:10:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Or is it going to make our product look cheapy-cheapy-option?\n\n0:10:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Production costs at 1250.\n\n0:10:18\tSPEAKER_02\n So for the huge margin.\n\n0:10:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Half of the selling prices.\n\n0:10:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Taking that by building it.\n\n0:10:26\tSPEAKER_02\n And profit aim is 15 million euros, which is that?\n\n0:10:30\tSPEAKER_01\n You know, first year.\n\n0:10:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:10:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:34\tSPEAKER_02\n I presume so.\n\n0:10:38\tSPEAKER_01\n You've got market range international.\n\n0:10:40\tSPEAKER_01\n And you did say earlier it's got to be accessible and usable by all age groups.\n\n0:10:45\tSPEAKER_01\n We're not focusing on business market.\n\n0:10:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Any particular thing.\n\n0:10:49\tSPEAKER_01\n It's everyone.\n\n0:10:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Use a friend of everyone.\n\n0:10:52\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:10:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Big target group.\n\n0:10:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:10:56\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think we have to...\n\n0:10:57\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that.\n\n0:11:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Making that key point.\n\n0:11:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Just that it's going to be an international market.\n\n0:11:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Like, that's trading America.\n\n0:11:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Things like that.\n\n0:11:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:11:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Water New Experience is in film and controls.\n\n0:11:19\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, we've got...\n\n0:11:22\tSPEAKER_02\n We have three videos, a TV and sort of amp thing.\n\n0:11:27\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll set up.\n\n0:11:28\tSPEAKER_02\n So we've got one of the Universal remote controls.\n\n0:11:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:32\tSPEAKER_02\n The program, each of you is in too.\n\n0:11:35\tSPEAKER_02\n But that kept losing the signals.\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_02\n So we have to reprogram it every now and again.\n\n0:11:39\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it was quite cheap as well.\n\n0:11:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:42\tSPEAKER_02\n That might have happened to you.\n\n0:11:43\tSPEAKER_02\n But that was quite good.\n\n0:11:44\tSPEAKER_02\n The fact that you could...\n\n0:11:45\tSPEAKER_00\n You saw the ones that you have.\n\n0:11:47\tSPEAKER_02\n You didn't have six remote controls.\n\n0:11:49\tSPEAKER_03\n You want to do great everything into one.\n\n0:11:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:52\tSPEAKER_01\n My experience has only been given the remote control with the object I buy.\n\n0:11:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Not doing any tampering with it in programming.\n\n0:11:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Using it to program TV videos and things.\n\n0:12:02\tSPEAKER_01\n But basically on or volume up and down.\n\n0:12:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Channel one to that basic function.\n\n0:12:08\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't think I could go any further with it.\n\n0:12:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Than that.\n\n0:12:11\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:12:12\tSPEAKER_01\n So there's got to be something usable by someone like me as well.\n\n0:12:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's the main stuff anyway.\n\n0:12:18\tSPEAKER_02\n And you don't want to...\n\n0:12:20\tSPEAKER_02\n I hate looking at a control.\n\n0:12:23\tSPEAKER_02\n And seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words.\n\n0:12:27\tSPEAKER_02\n And seeing what they all do.\n\n0:12:28\tSPEAKER_02\n And just sitting there searching for the teletext button.\n\n0:12:31\tSPEAKER_01\n And still, you don't necessarily understand symbols you're meant to understand.\n\n0:12:34\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:12:35\tSPEAKER_02\n When you've got the main things on the front of it.\n\n0:12:40\tSPEAKER_02\n And a section opens up for something.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_02\n To the other functions when you can do sound.\n\n0:12:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Or actually kind of recording things like that inside it.\n\n0:12:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Because it doesn't make...\n\n0:12:53\tSPEAKER_02\n When you pick it up, it doesn't make it really complicated to look at.\n\n0:12:56\tSPEAKER_02\n It's obvious.\n\n0:12:57\tSPEAKER_02\n What you're doing.\n\n0:12:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Actually, that just raises a point.\n\n0:13:00\tSPEAKER_01\n I wonder what our design people think.\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_01\n But you know on a mobile phone, you can press the key.\n\n0:13:05\tSPEAKER_01\n And it gives you a menu.\n\n0:13:07\tSPEAKER_01\n It's got a menu display.\n\n0:13:08\tSPEAKER_01\n I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful.\n\n0:13:12\tSPEAKER_01\n So you've got a little LCD display.\n\n0:13:14\tSPEAKER_03\n I was thinking of the same lines.\n\n0:13:16\tSPEAKER_03\n You instead of having too many buttons and make it complicated for the user.\n\n0:13:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe you have an LCD display or something like that, like a mobile.\n\n0:13:23\tSPEAKER_03\n With menus.\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_01\n And with menus.\n\n0:13:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:26\tSPEAKER_03\n And if it's somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone, people might find it easier to browse and navigate also.\n\n0:13:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_02\n What about the older generation?\n\n0:13:34\tSPEAKER_02\n What about Granny and Grandex?\n\n0:13:35\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't understand.\n\n0:13:37\tSPEAKER_02\n My Grandex can answer his mobile phone.\n\n0:13:40\tSPEAKER_02\n He couldn't even dream of texting or something like that.\n\n0:13:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Can he program his remote controller?\n\n0:13:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Is he basic with that too?\n\n0:13:48\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think they're taping.\n\n0:13:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:51\tSPEAKER_00\n My Grandex is better than me using teletax.\n\n0:13:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:13:54\tSPEAKER_01\n So that's a problem, regardless of any design modifications you come up with.\n\n0:13:59\tSPEAKER_01\n That's going to be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps.\n\n0:14:02\tSPEAKER_01\n And that's another issue over time.\n\n0:14:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, it just needs to be as long as it's self intuitive.\n\n0:14:08\tSPEAKER_00\n And you can work out why everything's doing.\n\n0:14:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Because I mean menus on sort of neat phones now.\n\n0:14:17\tSPEAKER_00\n They're still got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do.\n\n0:14:22\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know how.\n\n0:14:25\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know how.\n\n0:14:26\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't like the new phones that kind of got a windows based running system.\n\n0:14:32\tSPEAKER_02\n I find it really confusing.\n\n0:14:35\tSPEAKER_02\n I kept getting lost in the phone.\n\n0:14:37\tSPEAKER_02\n I have not got a new one but my friend got a new one.\n\n0:14:40\tSPEAKER_02\n And I was trying to do things with it.\n\n0:14:42\tSPEAKER_02\n And I just kept getting lost.\n\n0:14:44\tSPEAKER_02\n But that's just me.\n\n0:14:46\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know how for 25 or 12 euros 50, how much of an excellent screen you could get.\n\n0:14:54\tSPEAKER_00\n You'd have to so keep it down to a black and white LCD thing in your room.\n\n0:14:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Is it possible that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for a large print like you do in large print books?\n\n0:15:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Obviously it displays less on the screen.\n\n0:15:08\tSPEAKER_01\n It displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing.\n\n0:15:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Or what about kind of a dual function in that you've got the basic buttons just for your play volume program things?\n\n0:15:23\tSPEAKER_02\n And also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures, obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that.\n\n0:15:35\tSPEAKER_01\n The other thing is just tucking into mobile phone design features again.\n\n0:15:40\tSPEAKER_01\n You could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the flip over.\n\n0:15:48\tSPEAKER_02\n I think that's a cost of thing.\n\n0:15:50\tSPEAKER_03\n How much are you going to know about?\n\n0:15:53\tSPEAKER_03\n It might save a bit of space instead of looking bulkier, it might look small.\n\n0:15:57\tSPEAKER_01\n But it might have some cost implications.\n\n0:16:00\tSPEAKER_01\n And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone.\n\n0:16:04\tSPEAKER_01\n It can still be lightweight plastic, you know, something that's easily molded and produced.\n\n0:16:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Sorry, I'm trying on your territory guys.\n\n0:16:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Right, okay, we've got half there for the next meeting.\n\n0:16:16\tSPEAKER_02\n So we're all going to go off and do our individual things.\n\n0:16:21\tSPEAKER_02\n I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and meet again.\n\n0:16:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:26\tSPEAKER_02\n And I get to do another fantastic presentation.\n\n0:16:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Just a quick thing about the, what you're saying about the, doesn't need to be fashionable.\n\n0:16:37\tSPEAKER_00\n So I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the, we put the fashion into electronics.\n\n0:16:45\tSPEAKER_00\n I think the whole design thing might be fine.\n\n0:16:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Sure.\n\n0:16:50\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, you can still have plastic and it looks quite good.\n\n0:16:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I mean, it doesn't have to be, you know, that that was my main point.\n\n0:16:59\tSPEAKER_01\n We do have to use metal.\n\n0:17:00\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper, I presume it would.\n\n0:17:05\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, the sky will look like controls.\n\n0:17:07\tSPEAKER_02\n And they're kind of molded and look a bit different than the telewesteral control to fill up a plastic.\n\n0:17:13\tSPEAKER_02\n It looks a bit slotted.\n\n0:17:15\tSPEAKER_02\n So yeah, I guess that's a second.\n\n0:17:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:17:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:17:20\tSPEAKER_02\n So let's break up there.\n\n0:17:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:17:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:17:24\tSPEAKER_02\n So see you in half an hour.\n\n0:17:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Do we go back to our roofing system?\n\n0:17:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:29\tNone\n Okay.\n\n", "summary":
