place I can have a meal with is the best restaurant in my career.\n\n0:00:28\tSPEAKER_04\n I'm just one of the most frustrating meetings of my career.\n\n0:00:32\tSPEAKER_02\n It's definitely not the most frustrating meeting I've ever had.\n\n0:00:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Remember you're being recorded at this point.\n\n0:00:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:00:40\tSPEAKER_01\n We need to specify it with whom.\n\n0:00:42\tSPEAKER_05\n So that's why Keith and I are going to be a little bit used for the first half of the meeting.\n\n0:00:46\tSPEAKER_05\n I avoided that as long as I couldn't.\n\n0:00:54\tSPEAKER_04\n I'm very appreciative of that.\n\n0:00:56\tSPEAKER_04\n I know you were doing that.\n\n0:00:58\tSPEAKER_02\n How did it exactly that paperly Danny like breaks?\n\n0:01:02\tSPEAKER_04\n I have to tell you what they're up to.\n\n0:01:08\tSPEAKER_04\n I love that story.\n\n0:01:10\tSPEAKER_04\n It's a great story.\n\n0:01:12\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:01:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh my goodness.\n\n0:01:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh yeah.\n\n0:01:20\tSPEAKER_03\n This is just that we could start off by doing the digits all at the same time.\n\n0:01:24\tSPEAKER_02\n What?\n\n0:01:26\tSPEAKER_02\n All at the same time.\n\n0:01:28\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know if I would get distracted and confused probably.\n\n0:01:30\tSPEAKER_05\n Are you being silly?\n\n0:01:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Everybody's got different digits right?\n\n0:01:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:01:36\tSPEAKER_05\n You're kidding.\n\n0:01:38\tSPEAKER_05\n Any rate?\n\n0:01:42\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:01:44\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:01:46\tSPEAKER_03\n This is what I want to hear.\n\n0:01:48\tSPEAKER_03\n This is transcript L6-4-3-7-4-1.\n\n0:01:52\tNone\n

Just, just a few times.\n\n0:02:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:02:44\tSPEAKER_03\n It doesn't matter for them.\n\n0:02:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Are we gonna start all our meetings out that way for no one?\n\n0:02:52\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:02:53\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:02:54\tSPEAKER_01\n I kind of like it.\n\n0:02:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Could we?\n\n0:02:56\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a satisfy.\n\n0:02:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:02:58\tSPEAKER_01\n It's so cool.\n\n0:03:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Are we there just to make sure I know what's going on.\n\n0:03:12\tSPEAKER_02\n We're talking about Robert's thesis proposal today.\n\n0:03:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Is that we?\n\n0:03:16\tSPEAKER_03\n We are.\n\n0:03:17\tSPEAKER_03\n We might.\n\n0:03:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:03:19\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, you said there were two things that you might want to do.\n\n0:03:22\tSPEAKER_05\n One was rehearse your...\n\n0:03:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, yes.\n\n0:03:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Not rehearse.\n\n0:03:27\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, I have just not spent any time on it.\n\n0:03:30\tSPEAKER_03\n So I can show you what I've got, get your input on it, and maybe some suggestions that would be great.\n\n0:03:35\tSPEAKER_03\n And the same is true for the proposal.\n\n0:03:39\tSPEAKER_03\n I will have time to do some revision and some additional stuff on various airplanes and trains.\n\n0:03:46\tSPEAKER_03\n So, I don't know how much of a chance you had to actually read it.\n\n0:03:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Because...\n\n0:03:55\tSPEAKER_03\n But you could always send me comments for an electronic mail.\n\n0:03:59\tSPEAKER_03\n And they will be incorporated.\n\n0:04:02\tSPEAKER_03\n The...\n\n0:04:05\tSPEAKER_03\n It basically says, well, this is Construle, and then it continues to say that one could potentially build a probabilistic relational model that has some general domain general rules, how things are construed, and then the idea is to use a entology situation user and discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilistic relational model to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what?\n\n0:04:41\tSPEAKER_03\n In our beloved tourism domain.\n\n0:04:45\tSPEAKER_03\n But with the focus on this, this is good.\n\n0:04:50\tSPEAKER_04\n I need a copy of this, yes.\n\n0:04:53\tSPEAKER_04\n Can I get a copy around?\n\n0:04:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, I can pass my extra copy around.\n\n0:04:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, you can read it.\n\n0:04:59\tSPEAKER_02\n You can read it.\n\n0:05:00\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:05:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Actually, this is the newest version after your comments.\n\n0:05:07\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, no, I see this has got the castle in it and stuff like that.\n\n0:05:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, maybe the version I didn't have.\n\n0:05:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Did the one you sent on the email?\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Have the...\n\n0:05:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:21\tSPEAKER_02\n That was the most recent one?\n\n0:05:22\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n0:05:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Because I read halfway, but I didn't see a castle thing.\n\n0:05:28\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm changing this.\n\n0:05:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:31\tSPEAKER_03\n If you would have checked your email, you may have received a note from you, as you to send me the...\n\n0:05:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:05:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Sorry.\n\n0:05:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Current formulas.\n\n0:05:43\tSPEAKER_01\n I will.\n\n0:05:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:05:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:05:46\tSPEAKER_03\n But for this, it doesn't matter.\n\n0:05:51\tSPEAKER_01\n We can talk about it later.\n\n0:05:53\tSPEAKER_01\n That's not even ready, so.\n\n0:05:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, go on to it, whatever.\n\n0:05:58\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm making changes to not worry about that.\n\n0:06:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, okay, sorry.\n\n0:06:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Come on.\n\n0:06:05\tSPEAKER_03\n In any type of comment, whether it's a spelling or a syntax or...\n\n0:06:10\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't really want to see it.\n\n0:06:12\tSPEAKER_04\n I just want to ask an interesting...\n\n0:06:14\tSPEAKER_04\n I'm page five.\n\n0:06:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Interesting.\n\n0:06:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Anyway.\n\n0:06:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Email anytime, but most useful before...\n\n0:06:24\tSPEAKER_02\n The 21st, I'm assuming.\n\n0:06:26\tSPEAKER_03\n The 21st?\n\n0:06:27\tSPEAKER_03\n The 21st.\n\n0:06:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Today's the 21st.\n\n0:06:29\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll better hurry up.\n\n0:06:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, man.\n\n0:06:31\tSPEAKER_00\n The 29th.\n\n0:06:32\tSPEAKER_00\n The 29th.\n\n0:06:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:06:34\tNone\n That's when I'm meeting with Wafeng Walsh, or to sell him this idea.\n\n0:06:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:06:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:06:48\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:06:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Then I'm also going to present a little talk at email.\n\n0:06:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:06:59\tSPEAKER_03\n About what we have done here.\n\n0:07:03\tSPEAKER_03\n And so, of course, I'm going to start out with this slide.\n\n0:07:09\tSPEAKER_03\n So, the most relevant aspects of our stay here.\n\n0:07:13\tSPEAKER_03\n And then I'm asking them to imagine that they're standing somewhere in Hydeburg and someone asked them in the morning.\n\n0:07:25\tSPEAKER_03\n The cave 45 is a well-known discotheque, which is certainly not open at that time.\n\n0:07:33\tSPEAKER_03\n And so, they're supposed to imagine that, you know, do they think the person wants to go there, or just know where it is?\n\n0:07:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Which is probably not the case in that discotheque example.\n\n0:07:50\tSPEAKER_03\n In the Bavaria example, it just want to know where it is.\n\n0:07:54\tSPEAKER_03\n And so, basically, we can make a point that here is where we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge.\n\n0:08:00\tSPEAKER_03\n But if it's 9 p.m. in the evening, then the discotheque question would be, for example, one that might ask for directions, sort of just location.\n\n0:08:13\tSPEAKER_03\n And so forth.\n\n0:08:14\tSPEAKER_03\n And so forth.\n\n0:08:15\tSPEAKER_03\n That's sort of motivating it.\n\n0:08:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Then what have we done?\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_03\n So, while we had our little bit of smart com stuff that we did.\n\n0:08:26\tSPEAKER_03\n I would have done the parser done.\n\n0:08:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Sorry.\n\n0:08:29\tSPEAKER_03\n That's not the construction parser.\n\n0:08:32\tSPEAKER_03\n That's the template paste.\n\n0:08:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:08:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Parser and the generation.\n\n0:08:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Halfway done?\n\n0:08:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:40\tSPEAKER_03\n That's done.\n\n0:08:41\tSPEAKER_03\n You actually change the strategies, right?\n\n0:08:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:44\tSPEAKER_03\n That's 10 words.\n\n0:08:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, it, you know, maybe 12.\n\n0:08:49\tSPEAKER_03\n 12?\n\n0:08:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:08:51\tSPEAKER_03\n And, um, and phase doing the synthesis stuff as we speak.\n\n0:08:58\tSPEAKER_03\n That's all about that.\n\n0:09:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Then I'm going to talk about the data.\n\n0:09:01\tSPEAKER_03\n You know these things about, actually, have an example.\n\n0:09:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Probably.\n\n0:09:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Two.\n\n0:09:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Can you hear that?\n\n0:09:12\tSPEAKER_03\n We should have turned the volume on.\n\n0:09:14\tSPEAKER_02\n I can hear it.\n\n0:09:16\tSPEAKER_02\n They might not hear it in the...\n\n0:09:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Or maybe it will.\n\n0:09:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Where are you going to take my club?\n\n0:09:31\tSPEAKER_01\n This was the natural subjects.\n\n0:09:33\tSPEAKER_01\n It sounds like fake.\n\n0:09:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:36\tSPEAKER_03\n But they're mimicking the synthesis when they speak to the computer.\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_03\n You can observe that all the time.\n\n0:09:41\tSPEAKER_03\n They're trying to match their prosody onto the machine.\n\n0:09:45\tNone\n The positive thing is, who is the young cancer?\n\n0:09:52\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, it's pretty slow.\n\n0:09:59\tNone\n Where is it?\n\n0:10:02\tSPEAKER_03\n I wonder who\u00c3\u00a6rr 2gsan the average 22kL.\n\n0:10:24\tSPEAKER_01\n What is this? Oh\n\n0:10:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, answer for, answer for. I will talk about problems with the refraising and how we solved it and some preliminary observations also. I'm not going to put in the figures from this, but I thought it would be interesting to point out that it's basically the same.\n\n0:11:22\tSPEAKER_03\n It is an every human-human telephone conversation and the human computer telephone conversation is of course quite different from some first observations.\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Then sort of feature back to our original problem, because how to get there, but actually is happening there today.\n\n0:11:50\tSPEAKER_03\n And then maybe talk about the big picture here. Tell a little bit as much as I can about the ETL story.\n\n0:12:00\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm not quite sure about this, whether I should put this in, that you have these two sort of different ideas that are different camps of people envisioning how language understanding works.\n\n0:12:20\tSPEAKER_03\n And then talk a little bit about the embodied simulation approach, pivot here, and as a prelude, talk about monkeys in Italy.\n\n0:12:35\tSPEAKER_03\n And Thrinny was going to send me some slides, but he didn't do it. So from that I have to paper, I can mic a resume of that.\n\n0:12:45\tSPEAKER_03\n I stole an X-Skima from one of your talks, I think.\n\n0:12:50\tSPEAKER_00\n I was like, where'd you get that? It looks familiar.\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_03\n I think that's Bergen Chang, something with the other.\n\n0:13:00\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm not going to bring that. So that's basically what I have so far, the rest is for airplanes.\n\n0:13:08\tSPEAKER_03\n So X-Skimas, then I would like to talk about the construction aspect and then at the end about our basenet.\n\n0:13:18\tSPEAKER_03\n End of story.\n\n0:13:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Anything I forgot that we should mention?\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Now maybe the FMRI stuff. Should I mention the fact that we're also actually starting to start to look at people's brains in a more direct way?\n\n0:13:44\tSPEAKER_01\n I just want to like tack that on as a comment.\n\n0:13:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Future activities, something.\n\n0:13:51\tSPEAKER_05\n It's hard to mention that you mentioned that when you talk about mirror neurons, then you should talk about the recent stuff about the Tiki.\n\n0:14:03\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:04\tSPEAKER_05\n And the man has seen how to explain the same phenomenon that we're talking about.\n\n0:14:13\tSPEAKER_05\n So that's the end of the work that I'm going to do.\n\n0:14:20\tNone\n So that's one thing.\n\n0:14:23\tNone\n It depends. There is a language learning story.\n\n0:14:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Actually, even on your black face, you've got a role where the picture is in the bottom.\n\n0:14:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah. I do have it here.\n\n0:14:46\tSPEAKER_03\n And of course, the big picture is this bit.\n\n0:14:52\tSPEAKER_03\n But I don't think I am capable of putting this off and doing justice to the matter.\n\n0:14:58\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, there is interesting stuff in terms of how language works.\n\n0:15:02\tSPEAKER_03\n So the emergentism story would be nice to tell people what's happening there.\n\n0:15:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Plus how the language learning stuff works.\n\n0:15:16\tSPEAKER_03\n But...\n\n0:15:17\tNone\n I mean, I think that's not...\n\n0:15:20\tNone\n What is it?\n\n0:15:23\tNone\n It may not be that you might want to...\n\n0:15:28\tNone\n...and the slides are...\n\n0:15:43\tNone\n...simulation.\n\n0:15:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah. That comes up to the ex-schema slide.\n\n0:15:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:15:49\tSPEAKER_03\n So basically, I'm going to steal that from Nancy.\n\n0:15:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay. I can give you a more recent...\n\n0:15:54\tSPEAKER_01\n...if you want.\n\n0:15:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, that might help.\n\n0:15:58\tSPEAKER_03\n But I also have stuff you trash you left over, your quals and your triple AI.\n\n0:16:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Which I can even email you that, you know, like the probably was a few changes.\n\n0:16:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Not big deal.\n\n0:16:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, you could steal anything you want, actually.\n\n0:16:15\tSPEAKER_01\n You already done, obviously.\n\n0:16:19\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't feel bad about it at all because you are on the title.\n\n0:16:23\tSPEAKER_01\n That's great. That's great.\n\n0:16:26\tSPEAKER_03\n And glad to see the complication.\n\n0:16:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Provocated?\n\n0:16:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that's great.\n\n0:16:34\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, you might even mention that this work you're doing is sort of also with the MPI in Liptsick.\n\n0:16:41\tSPEAKER_01\n It's certainly related.\n\n0:16:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Because email is building up a huge thing in Liptsick.\n\n0:16:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Is it?\n\n0:16:49\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a bio-computation.\n\n0:16:53\tNone\n This is the DNA building.\n\n0:16:55\tSPEAKER_01\n How do you look at building?\n\n0:16:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Kind of a different level of analysis.\n\n0:17:00\tSPEAKER_05\n You have multiple buildings at the moment.\n\n0:17:04\tSPEAKER_02\n All sorts of clear things.\n\n0:17:07\tSPEAKER_02\n They're building in the shape of DNA.\n\n0:17:10\tSPEAKER_04\n So you said...\n\n0:17:13\tNone\n What?\n\n0:17:16\tSPEAKER_04\n That's really annoying.\n\n0:17:19\tSPEAKER_05\n I mean, I spent a lot of money there.\n\n0:17:22\tSPEAKER_05\n I spent a few hours doing this.\n\n0:17:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, you definitely want to...\n\n0:17:27\tSPEAKER_02\n What's the building?\n\n0:17:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Don't want to waste that money on research.\n\n0:17:31\tSPEAKER_02\n It's horrible.\n\n0:17:34\tSPEAKER_05\n You didn't build with research.\n\n0:17:37\tSPEAKER_01\n I think you did more money.\n\n0:17:39\tSPEAKER_01\n They just want a fun place for them to...\n\n0:17:42\tSPEAKER_04\n And everybody gets a trampoline in there often.\n\n0:17:45\tSPEAKER_03\n The offices are actually a little...\n\n0:17:48\tSPEAKER_03\n You think of ramps coming out of the double headaches.\n\n0:17:51\tSPEAKER_03\n And then you have these half-doms.\n\n0:17:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Class half-doms.\n\n0:17:54\tSPEAKER_03\n And the offices are in the class half-dom.\n\n0:17:58\tSPEAKER_04\n All right, let's start talking about this.\n\n0:18:01\tSPEAKER_04\n Does it exist yet?\n\n0:18:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Is it a model?\n\n0:18:06\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it's...\n\n0:18:09\tNone\n It's a lot of...\n\n0:18:15\tNone\n It's interactive.\n\n0:18:17\tNone\n It's a little bit of a system.\n\n0:18:19\tNone\n And...\n\n0:18:26\tSPEAKER_05\n The combination of the biology and the likes of the invention.\n\n0:18:30\tNone\n And that's...\n\n0:18:33\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, another of that was talking about your thesis.\n\n0:18:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, if somebody has something to say.\n\n0:18:44\tSPEAKER_04\n You might want to double check the spellings of the author's names on your references.\n\n0:18:48\tSPEAKER_04\n You had a few misspells in your slides there.\n\n0:18:51\tSPEAKER_04\n Like, I believe you had Jack and Dorf.\n\n0:18:56\tNone\n Unless there's a person called Jack and Dorf.\n\n0:18:58\tNone\n On that one.\n\n0:19:00\tSPEAKER_04\n That's the only thing I noticed in there.\n\n0:19:03\tSPEAKER_01\n In the presentation?\n\n0:19:04\tSPEAKER_01\n I'll probably have comments for you separately.\n\n0:19:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, in the presentation?\n\n0:19:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that's actually worried about Biptech.\n\n0:19:13\tSPEAKER_03\n No, that's quite possible.\n\n0:19:15\tSPEAKER_03\n It's copy and paste from something.\n\n0:19:21\tSPEAKER_05\n So I think it looks like...\n\n0:19:26\tSPEAKER_03\n It did.\n\n0:19:27\tSPEAKER_03\n There is a reference to Srini.\n\n0:19:30\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, did you put in something about...\n\n0:19:35\tSPEAKER_05\n Metalline metaphor here, right?\n\n0:19:37\tSPEAKER_05\n The individual...\n\n0:19:39\tSPEAKER_05\n We talked about putting in something about people and...\n\n0:19:45\tNone\n Oh, yeah, okay.\n\n0:19:49\tNone\n Good.\n\n0:19:50\tNone\n I see where you have it.\n\n0:19:55\tSPEAKER_05\n I think that's the problem.\n\n0:20:01\tNone\n What I think is...\n\n0:20:05\tSPEAKER_05\n I think even if you put this...\n\n0:20:10\tSPEAKER_05\n It's a little bit of a false verb.\n\n0:20:17\tNone\n Unless you put it there, it's a verb.\n\n0:20:20\tNone\n I think we talked about scalability yet by...\n\n0:20:27\tNone\n Binding and destruction.\n\n0:20:30\tNone\n General Constructural mechanism.\n\n0:20:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Is that in there?\n\n0:20:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:34\tSPEAKER_03\n It's good for us.\n\n0:20:36\tSPEAKER_03\n But I did not focus on that aspect, but...\n\n0:20:45\tSPEAKER_03\n It's just underneath that reference to metaphor.\n\n0:20:50\tSPEAKER_03\n So it's last paragraph before, so on page two, a main focus.\n\n0:21:06\tSPEAKER_03\n But it's pretty...\n\n0:21:07\tSPEAKER_03\n It's not about that, yeah.\n\n0:21:09\tSPEAKER_03\n No, it says it, but it doesn't say it does.\n\n0:21:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Why?\n\n0:21:15\tSPEAKER_03\n It doesn't give much of a...\n\n0:21:18\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, let me tell you what.\n\n0:21:21\tNone\n I think the punchline is because it's actually working.\n\n0:21:26\tSPEAKER_05\n Which is that the constructions that...\n\n0:21:33\tNone\n...are doing...\n\n0:21:36\tNone\n...are in a way quite...\n\n0:21:41\tSPEAKER_05\n...but cover only base cases.\n\n0:21:48\tNone\n And to make them a fine...\n\n0:21:52\tSPEAKER_05\n...to work with cases, an inmate cases, and all those things.\n\n0:21:56\tSPEAKER_05\n It requires additional mechanism of...\n\n0:22:00\tSPEAKER_05\n...and the punchline is...\n\n0:22:03\tNone\n...then...\n\n0:22:06\tNone\n...right, you can get essentially your flogginality...\n\n0:22:10\tNone\n...that you have to do some new construction...\n\n0:22:14\tNone\n...at the base level.\n\n0:22:16\tNone\n It should interact with all the metatonnes and metaphors...\n\n0:22:19\tSPEAKER_05\n...and all of the projections of it also should work.\n\n0:22:24\tSPEAKER_05\n And similarly, it's the new metaphor...\n\n0:22:28\tNone\n...and it should...\n\n0:22:31\tSPEAKER_04\n...compose with all the constructions.\n\n0:22:36\tNone\n That's true, they're...\n\n0:22:40\tNone\n...it's a big way of...\n\n0:22:55\tSPEAKER_02\n So does that mean instead of having tens and tens of rules in your...\n\n0:22:58\tSPEAKER_02\n...contextually grammar, you just have...\n\n0:23:01\tSPEAKER_02\n...these base constructions and then general mechanism for co-wersing in them.\n\n0:23:05\tSPEAKER_02\n So that, for example, in the metaphor case...\n\n0:23:15\tNone\n...the every time direct idea of source path and goal...\n\n0:23:20\tNone\n...and any metaphor will be tensed, right?\n\n0:23:25\tSPEAKER_00\n And you can say grammar is the same thing.\n\n0:23:29\tNone\n But the trick is...\n\n0:23:34\tNone\n...the way the constructions...\n\n0:23:37\tSPEAKER_05\n...it requires the logic of the position...\n\n0:23:40\tNone\n...for example, the heat as well, trouble is in the containers...\n\n0:23:44\tSPEAKER_02\n...which is extremely stressful.\n\n0:23:46\tNone\n So that's where...\n\n0:23:49\tSPEAKER_02\n So with constriction, you don't have to have a construction...\n\n0:23:52\tSPEAKER_02\n...for every possible thing to can fill the rule.\n\n0:23:59\tNone\n It's a very big deal if you have to string work here.\n\n0:24:03\tNone\n This is probably the same as the other.\n\n0:24:08\tNone\n I don't think so.\n\n0:24:12\tSPEAKER_03\n That doesn't say it at all, but...\n\n0:24:16\tNone\n...even though...\n\n0:24:31\tSPEAKER_03\n...even though...\n\n0:24:34\tSPEAKER_03\n...if there are basic cases, even...\n\n0:24:38\tSPEAKER_03\n...it seems like nothing is context free.\n\n0:24:42\tSPEAKER_05\n But walked into the cafe and ordered a drink...\n\n0:24:46\tNone\n...and walked into the cafe and broke his nose.\n\n0:24:50\tSPEAKER_03\n It doesn't mean there are any reasons.\n\n0:24:53\tSPEAKER_03\n It can't be explained.\n\n0:24:56\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a normal word, it's a physical object.\n\n0:25:00\tSPEAKER_05\n So it's multiple of the rules.\n\n0:25:03\tSPEAKER_05\n And if I take this part...\n\n0:25:06\tSPEAKER_05\n...it's a very simple thing.\n\n0:25:09\tSPEAKER_05\n It's a normal rule.\n\n0:25:12\tSPEAKER_05\n And if I take part of what we've done...\n\n0:25:15\tSPEAKER_00\n...it's just interaction we can leave the analysis...\n\n0:25:18\tSPEAKER_00\n...and it can stroll.\n\n0:25:21\tNone\n So yeah, it doesn't mean that you can't do it a go-play.\n\n0:25:28\tNone\n It does say that...\n\n0:25:32\tSPEAKER_04\n...if you walk into a cafe and you walk into a cafe...\n\n0:25:37\tNone\n...it's not consistent with other things.\n\n0:25:41\tNone\n You got to reject that reading.\n\n0:25:45\tSPEAKER_02\n You can't...\n\n0:25:46\tSPEAKER_02\n...dition me with your first sentence.\n\n0:25:48\tSPEAKER_02\n And so I thought, why would he walk into the cafe and then...\n\n0:25:50\tSPEAKER_02\n...somehow break his nose?\n\n0:25:52\tSPEAKER_04\n Just flip it on the way forward.\n\n0:25:58\tSPEAKER_03\n You don't find that usage...\n\n0:26:00\tSPEAKER_03\n...I checked for it in the Brown National Corpus.\n\n0:26:03\tSPEAKER_03\n So walking into never really means...\n\n0:26:07\tSPEAKER_03\n...what smack.\n\n0:26:09\tSPEAKER_03\n But if you walk smack into the cafe or slam into the wall...\n\n0:26:14\tNone\n...you will find running to...\n\n0:26:18\tSPEAKER_02\n...car's running the telephone balls all the time.\n\n0:26:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Or you can run into an old friend or...\n\n0:26:27\tSPEAKER_00\n No!\n\n0:26:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, running to might even be more impact sense...\n\n0:26:34\tSPEAKER_01\n...than, you know, container sense.\n\n0:26:41\tNone\n Like running to an old friend...\n\n0:26:45\tSPEAKER_05\n...crow, if someone is writing...\n\n0:26:49\tSPEAKER_05\n...you have George, we have George, we have something...\n\n0:26:52\tSPEAKER_05\n...complicative, reason-wondering...\n\n0:26:55\tNone\n...something else, and maybe it's...\n\n0:26:58\tNone\n...car-vide-event.\n\n0:27:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, contact.\n\n0:27:05\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, there's contact that's social contact, whatever.\n\n0:27:08\tSPEAKER_04\n Sutton's surprising contact.\n\n0:27:11\tSPEAKER_04\n First of all.\n\n0:27:13\tSPEAKER_04\n But of course, no, I mean, it has a life of its own...\n\n0:27:16\tSPEAKER_04\n...and sort of partially inspired by the spatial...\n\n0:27:19\tSPEAKER_04\n...yeah.\n\n0:27:20\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh yeah, but for sure.\n\n0:27:23\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you have a teacher that says that?\n\n0:27:29\tSPEAKER_01\n There's lots of things we can make teachers out of.\n\n0:27:34\tSPEAKER_01\n But, uh...\n\n0:27:37\tSPEAKER_01\n...we don't need to be...\n\n0:27:40\tSPEAKER_03\n...we don't need to be- Probably not your marks in the kitchen today.\n\n0:27:44\tSPEAKER_01\n No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n0:27:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:27:49\tSPEAKER_04\n In other news?\n\n0:27:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, well, the...\n\n0:27:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Actually, the...\n\n0:28:00\tSPEAKER_03\n What would have been really nice is to find an example for...\n\n0:28:06\tSPEAKER_03\n...all of this from our domain.\n\n0:28:11\tSPEAKER_03\n So maybe if we can make one up...\n\n0:28:14\tSPEAKER_03\n...now that would be incredibly helpful.\n\n0:28:16\tSPEAKER_01\n So where it should illustrate...\n\n0:28:19\tSPEAKER_01\n...how do we say all of this, do you mean like...\n\n0:28:22\tSPEAKER_01\n...I don't know, the related work stuff as well as...\n\n0:28:26\tSPEAKER_03\n...mapping?\n\n0:28:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, we have, for example, a canonical use of something.\n\n0:28:30\tSPEAKER_03\n And we have some constructions and then it's construed as something.\n\n0:28:34\tSPEAKER_03\n And then we may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use...\n\n0:28:39\tSPEAKER_03\n...that's also relevant to the domain.\n\n0:28:42\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, so it should be published here.\n\n0:28:45\tSPEAKER_05\n What's the first one?\n\n0:28:49\tSPEAKER_05\n It's where the buzz and on the buzz are.\n\n0:28:51\tNone\n That actually a little is really getting used because...\n\n0:28:54\tNone\n...there's some incident in this.\n\n0:28:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:28:59\tSPEAKER_03\n I had two hours with George on this.\n\n0:29:02\tSPEAKER_03\n What did he do?\n\n0:29:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Join the call.\n\n0:29:09\tSPEAKER_03\n The buzz is a metaphorical metonym that relates some metapath...\n\n0:29:15\tSPEAKER_03\n...metaphorically and you're on that path.\n\n0:29:18\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, there's a platform notion, right?\n\n0:29:22\tSPEAKER_03\n He's standing on the buzz waving to me.\n\n0:29:24\tSPEAKER_03\n But the regular, as we speak, John O. is on the buzz to New York.\n\n0:29:29\tSPEAKER_03\n That's what did I call it here?\n\n0:29:34\tSPEAKER_03\n The transportation schema, something...\n\n0:29:37\tSPEAKER_03\n...you can be on the first flight, on the second flight, and you can be...\n\n0:29:42\tSPEAKER_03\n...on the wagon.\n\n0:29:45\tSPEAKER_05\n So that may or may not be what you want to do.\n\n0:29:48\tSPEAKER_05\n It could do something much simpler.\n\n0:29:51\tSPEAKER_03\n But it's unfortunate.\n\n0:29:53\tSPEAKER_03\n This is not really something a tourist would ever say.\n\n0:29:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, as it was repairing it, there was something...\n\n0:30:00\tSPEAKER_03\n...but...\n\n0:30:02\tSPEAKER_03\n...we had initially started discussing the audio film.\n\n0:30:07\tSPEAKER_03\n And there's a lot of audio analysis.\n\n0:30:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Could we capture that?\n\n0:30:14\tSPEAKER_03\n With a different control of...\n\n0:30:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, we've thought about it before.\n\n0:30:20\tSPEAKER_01\n It's used as examples in other papers.\n\n0:30:23\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a little complicated.\n\n0:30:25\tSPEAKER_01\n I would have felt like it's a state of...\n\n0:30:27\tSPEAKER_01\n...there's resource, right?\n\n0:30:29\tSPEAKER_01\n What is film?\n\n0:30:32\tSPEAKER_01\n You're out of the state of having film, right?\n\n0:30:35\tSPEAKER_01\n And somehow film is standing for the resource.\n\n0:30:38\tSPEAKER_01\n But the state of having some resource is just labeled as that resource.\n\n0:30:42\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, I mean, plus the fact that there's also...\n\n0:30:46\tSPEAKER_04\n...I mean, can you say, like, the film ran out, you know, or...\n\n0:30:50\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, it's film with a projector.\n\n0:30:52\tSPEAKER_04\n So like the film went away from where it should be, namely with you, or something like, you know...\n\n0:30:57\tSPEAKER_04\n...the film is gone, right?\n\n0:31:00\tSPEAKER_04\n I never really knew what was going on.\n\n0:31:03\tSPEAKER_04\n I mean, I find it sort of a little bit far-fetched to say that...\n\n0:31:06\tSPEAKER_04\n...that I'm out of film means that I have left the state of having film or something like that.\n\n0:31:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Or having is also associated with location, right?\n\n0:31:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:16\tSPEAKER_01\n So if the film left, you know, the...\n\n0:31:18\tSPEAKER_03\n So running out of something is different from being out of somewhere.\n\n0:31:22\tNone\n Well, being out of something is...\n\n0:31:25\tSPEAKER_01\n So running out of it is just a process.\n\n0:31:28\tSPEAKER_01\n But that's some run, yeah.\n\n0:31:30\tSPEAKER_01\n That's okay.\n\n0:31:31\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, the final state of running out of something is being out of it.\n\n0:31:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:37\tSPEAKER_04\n You got there.\n\n0:31:38\tSPEAKER_04\n That part is fine.\n\n0:31:39\tSPEAKER_04\n You got that out of it.\n\n0:31:46\tNone\n So, no one is...\n\n0:31:48\tSPEAKER_05\n...the professional linguists they have.\n\n0:31:51\tSPEAKER_01\n This whole piece is on that.\n\n0:31:53\tSPEAKER_01\n There was...\n\n0:31:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Out.\n\n0:31:56\tSPEAKER_04\n There was one on...\n\n0:31:58\tSPEAKER_04\n...an out or out of.\n\n0:32:00\tSPEAKER_04\n Maybe it just out.\n\n0:32:01\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:32:02\tSPEAKER_05\n It was over, but there was also a big one out.\n\n0:32:04\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, Susan, one right?\n\n0:32:06\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:32:07\tSPEAKER_04\n The syrup spread out, anything.\n\n0:32:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:11\tSPEAKER_01\n And, undoubtedly, there's been...\n\n0:32:14\tSPEAKER_01\n...remes of work about it in...\n\n0:32:16\tSPEAKER_01\n...tyre linguistics, but...\n\n0:32:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:18\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:32:20\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not one of the...\n\n0:32:23\tSPEAKER_01\n...more straightforward ones to defend.\n\n0:32:25\tSPEAKER_01\n So, you probably don't want to use it for purposes.\n\n0:32:27\tSPEAKER_01\n These are...\n\n0:32:28\tSPEAKER_01\n...you're just like computational linguists, right?\n\n0:32:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Or...\n\n0:32:32\tSPEAKER_03\n...are you?\n\n0:32:33\tSPEAKER_03\n There is...\n\n0:32:34\tSPEAKER_01\n...it's going to be four computational linguists.\n\n0:32:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:32:37\tSPEAKER_01\n But more...\n\n0:32:38\tSPEAKER_01\n...compices on the computational...\n\n0:32:39\tSPEAKER_03\n...for emphasis on the linguists.\n\n0:32:41\tSPEAKER_03\n More...\n\n0:32:42\tSPEAKER_03\n...there's going to be...\n\n0:32:43\tSPEAKER_03\n...just for computational linguists,...by coincidence,...for the rest is whatever bio-computing people and...\n\n0:32:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:32:49\tSPEAKER_01\n So, I mean, this, you know, like...\n\n0:32:51\tSPEAKER_03\n The computer should be very computational.\n\n0:32:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:32:54\tSPEAKER_01\n So, I would stay away from one that involves weird...\n\n0:32:56\tSPEAKER_01\n...construal stuff.\n\n0:32:57\tSPEAKER_01\n You know, it's an obvious one.\n\n0:32:59\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, the...\n\n0:33:00\tSPEAKER_03\n...our bakery example might be nice.\n\n0:33:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Is there a bakery around here?\n\n0:33:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:03\tSPEAKER_03\n So, if you could really just...\n\n0:33:04\tSPEAKER_03\n...construit as a...\n\n0:33:05\tSPEAKER_03\n...no, it's the bakery itself.\n\n0:33:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Is it a building that you want to go to?\n\n0:33:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:33:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Or is it something to eat that you want to buy?\n\n0:33:14\tSPEAKER_03\n And then...\n\n0:33:16\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:33:17\tSPEAKER_01\n What?\n\n0:33:19\tSPEAKER_01\n The bakery can't be something you're going to eat.\n\n0:33:21\tSPEAKER_02\n This is a speech act.\n\n0:33:23\tSPEAKER_02\n It's true.\n\n0:33:25\tNone\n Exactly.\n\n0:33:26\tSPEAKER_05\n You want to...\n\n0:33:27\tSPEAKER_05\n...you...\n\n0:33:28\tSPEAKER_05\n...be green as a place that...\n\n0:33:31\tSPEAKER_05\n...you can get baked goods.\n\n0:33:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, that's one.\n\n0:33:34\tSPEAKER_05\n You want to buy something.\n\n0:33:35\tSPEAKER_05\n But the other is...\n\n0:33:37\tSPEAKER_05\n...you might smell the smell or just curious about what it would be...\n\n0:33:40\tSPEAKER_04\n...the bakery and the Naglewood.\n\n0:33:42\tSPEAKER_04\n You know, wonder how people here right there living...\n\n0:33:46\tNone\n...if they're living in such a reason why you might...\n\n0:33:49\tSPEAKER_05\n...pick up the eggs.\n\n0:33:51\tSPEAKER_05\n It doesn't mean I want to buy some baked goods.\n\n0:33:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:33:56\tNone\n Those are interesting examples.\n\n0:34:00\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not clear that there's a lot of pragmatics there.\n\n0:34:06\tSPEAKER_01\n There's a lot of stuff.\n\n0:34:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe beyond what you want to use.\n\n0:34:09\tSPEAKER_00\n So, let's first do...\n\n0:34:13\tSPEAKER_05\n...the first thing that's fun of eating is probably easiest than that.\n\n0:34:20\tNone\n And actually...\n\n0:34:22\tSPEAKER_01\n...the one you have...\n\n0:34:24\tSPEAKER_01\n...is the...\n\n0:34:26\tSPEAKER_01\n...you mean the steak wants to pay?\n\n0:34:28\tSPEAKER_01\n No, not that one.\n\n0:34:29\tSPEAKER_05\n That's a sort of background.\n\n0:34:31\tSPEAKER_05\n This is the page line.\n\n0:34:34\tSPEAKER_02\n The Play-Toe in the book.\n\n0:34:36\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:34:37\tSPEAKER_03\n How much does it cost?\n\n0:34:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Where's the castle?\n\n0:34:40\tSPEAKER_03\n How old is it?\n\n0:34:41\tSPEAKER_03\n How much does it cost?\n\n0:34:42\tSPEAKER_01\n To go in.\n\n0:34:45\tSPEAKER_04\n 200 million dollars.\n\n0:34:48\tSPEAKER_05\n So...\n\n0:34:55\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, I think that's gonna be good.\n\n0:34:58\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, that's good.\n\n0:35:00\tSPEAKER_03\n But as Nancy just suggested, it's probably elliptic.\n\n0:35:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Like, it doesn't refer to thing.\n\n0:35:07\tSPEAKER_01\n It refers to...\n\n0:35:09\tSPEAKER_01\n...things downing for active, most relevant activity for a tourist.\n\n0:35:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Good to give it that way.\n\n0:35:15\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, shoot.\n\n0:35:17\tSPEAKER_04\n Isn't that...\n\n0:35:18\tSPEAKER_04\n I mean, that's fun.\n\n0:35:19\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, my argument here is...\n\n0:35:21\tSPEAKER_03\n It's the same thing as Play-Toe's on the top shelf.\n\n0:35:24\tSPEAKER_03\n You can refer to...\n\n0:35:28\tSPEAKER_03\n...a book of Play-Toe by you, you should play it over here.\n\n0:35:31\tSPEAKER_03\n No, no, I'm agreeing that this is a good...\n\n0:35:33\tSPEAKER_03\n...back to it.\n\n0:35:34\tSPEAKER_03\n So, you can castles have...\n\n0:35:36\tSPEAKER_03\n...as truth, I'd say, have admission fees.\n\n0:35:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Where is the castle?\n\n0:35:40\tSPEAKER_03\n How much has it cost?\n\n0:35:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Um...\n\n0:35:47\tSPEAKER_03\n How far is it?\n\n0:35:49\tSPEAKER_03\n From here.\n\n0:35:51\tNone\n So...\n\n0:35:52\tSPEAKER_03\n You're also not...\n\n0:35:54\tSPEAKER_03\n...refereg to the...\n\n0:35:56\tSPEAKER_03\n...wets of the objectors.\n\n0:36:04\tNone\n Okay, do I think that a nice...\n\n0:36:06\tNone\n...can afford what you're aware of in a tourist building.\n\n0:36:26\tNone\n Oh, again, I was...\n\n0:36:28\tNone\n...you think that she's aware of...\n\n0:36:30\tNone\n...the amount of land.\n\n0:36:32\tNone\n Where was...\n\n0:36:37\tNone\n...there was height of earth...\n\n0:36:41\tNone\n...in 34 or something.\n\n0:36:46\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:47\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, or some such thing.\n\n0:36:49\tSPEAKER_04\n Like, what side were they on?\n\n0:36:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, it's like this.\n\n0:36:53\tSPEAKER_01\n It's here.\n\n0:36:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Um...\n\n0:37:04\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm like, it's developmental state or something like that.\n\n0:37:07\tSPEAKER_01\n You could...\n\n0:37:08\tSPEAKER_01\n...make it as you could get that.\n\n0:37:12\tSPEAKER_04\n I mean, there's also things like...\n\n0:37:15\tSPEAKER_04\n...I guess I could ask something like...\n\n0:37:19\tSPEAKER_04\n...where can I find out about blah blah blah...\n\n0:37:22\tSPEAKER_04\n...and the sort of...\n\n0:37:24\tSPEAKER_04\n...doesn't necessarily...\n\n0:37:25\tSPEAKER_04\n...I don't necessarily have to care about the spatial location.\n\n0:37:27\tSPEAKER_04\n Just give me a phone number and I'll call them or something like that.\n\n0:37:30\tNone\n We're starting to get that, yeah.\n\n0:37:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Where could I find it so open?\n\n0:37:35\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:40\tNone\n The dams.\n\n0:37:43\tNone\n And the traffic is horrible.\n\n0:37:46\tNone\n But there's...\n\n0:37:48\tNone\n...there's things about it.\n\n0:37:51\tNone\n You can also think about...\n\n0:37:57\tSPEAKER_03\n...how could I get out of the way?\n\n0:38:05\tSPEAKER_00\n State.\n\n0:38:09\tNone\n Is this the issue?\n\n0:38:12\tSPEAKER_05\n Is that maybe just a message?\n\n0:38:16\tSPEAKER_04\n That it's not the thing that's forthcoming.\n\n0:38:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Alright.\n\n0:38:21\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a more exotic one, version of that.\n\n0:38:27\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm really into...\n\n0:38:33\tSPEAKER_01\n...do you really say that?\n\n0:38:35\tSPEAKER_05\n Which you really say that?\n\n0:38:40\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm really into art.\n\n0:38:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, as I can say.\n\n0:38:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Fix expression, yeah.\n\n0:38:54\tSPEAKER_01\n There are all sorts of fixed expressions.\n\n0:38:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Out of sorts now.\n\n0:39:00\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean trouble.\n\n0:39:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, I mean, the data that I've looked at so far, there's tons of cases for polysamy.\n\n0:39:11\tSPEAKER_03\n So making reference to buildings as institutions, as containers, as...\n\n0:39:18\tSPEAKER_03\n...whatever.\n\n0:39:20\tSPEAKER_03\n So in music, for example, museums, as a building, or as something where pictures hang, or something that puts on exhibits, so forth.\n\n0:39:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Why don't you want to use any of this?\n\n0:39:37\tSPEAKER_03\n You know, one of these ones.\n\n0:39:41\tSPEAKER_03\n That's what I've started doing.\n\n0:39:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Metronomy, publicity.\n\n0:39:49\tSPEAKER_01\n How did you see the van go?\n\n0:39:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, geez.\n\n0:39:55\tSPEAKER_03\n But I think the argument should be...\n\n0:39:59\tSPEAKER_03\n...could be made that despite the fact that this is not the most metaphorical domain, because people interacting with HEI systems try to be straightforward and less lyrical.\n\n0:40:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Constructural still is, you know, completely key in terms of finding out any of these things.\n\n0:40:19\tSPEAKER_05\n That's a reasonable point.\n\n0:40:23\tSPEAKER_03\n This domain, you're going to get less metaphor in both sides.\n\n0:40:28\tSPEAKER_03\n With a student, I looked at the entire database that we have on Heidelberg for cases of autonomy, hardly anything.\n\n0:40:37\tSPEAKER_03\n So not even in descriptions, did we find anything relevant?\n\n0:40:44\tNone\n I have to go.\n\n0:40:50\tSPEAKER_03\n But okay, this is just something we'll see.\n\n0:41:01\tSPEAKER_03\n And deal with.\n\n0:41:09\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, maybe the where is something questioned as a whole?\n\n0:41:15\tSPEAKER_03\n It can be construed as a location versus instructional request.\n\n0:41:20\tSPEAKER_03\n So if we not talk about the direction.\n\n0:41:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Location versus what?\n\n0:41:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Instruction.\n\n0:41:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, directions.\n\n0:41:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:41:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, I thought that was...\n\n0:41:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Dimmalintry did as an example of construal.\n\n0:41:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but then, you know, on the lexical level.\n\n0:41:35\tSPEAKER_01\n This sort of one level higher.\n\n0:41:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, you want a lexical example.\n\n0:41:41\tSPEAKER_05\n But I don't need it.\n\n0:41:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:41:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Also, it would be nice to get ultimately to get a nice mental space example.\n\n0:41:51\tSPEAKER_03\n So, even temporal references are just the spatial domain of rare.\n\n0:42:01\tSPEAKER_05\n But it's easy to make up plausible ones.\n\n0:42:05\tSPEAKER_03\n When you're getting information on objects.\n\n0:42:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:42:09\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:15\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:16\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:17\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:19\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe we can include that also in our second data run.\n\n0:42:27\tSPEAKER_03\n We can show people pictures of objects and then have them ask the system about the objects and engage a conversation on the history and the art and the architecture and so forth.\n\n0:42:38\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:42:43\tSPEAKER_05\n So, why don't we give you feedback on what you're talking about?\n\n0:42:48\tNone\n I wish you were a true person.\n\n0:42:55\tNone\n I'm so sorry.\n\n0:43:01\tSPEAKER_02\n For some reason when you said feedback electronically, I thought of that. You ever see the symptoms where the family's got the buzzers and they buzz each other when they don't like what the other one is saying.\n\n0:43:11\tSPEAKER_01\n That's the first one, I think.\n\n0:43:14\tSPEAKER_02\n It was a very early one.\n\n0:43:15\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know.\n\n0:43:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:43:18\tSPEAKER_03\n First one.\n\n0:43:21\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm trying to play break the road record for different occasions, for being at Milan Airport.\n\n0:43:31\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:43:52\tNone\n I didn't see that.\n\n0:44:02\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:44:31\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:44:41\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't know.\n\n0:45:01\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:45:11\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know.\n\n0:45:40\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:45:50\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't know.\n\n0:46:10\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:46:20\tNone\n I don't know.\n\n0:46:40\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't know.\n\n0:47:00\tNone\n I don't know.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "SPEAKER and Keith are going to be used for the first half of the meeting.
