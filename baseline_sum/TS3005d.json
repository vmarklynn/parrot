bit busy in our shared project documents folder.\n\n0:00:24\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't know if everybody put their own documents in the right folder, which is for now the detailed design meeting.\n\n0:00:31\tSPEAKER_05\n That's newer.\n\n0:00:32\tSPEAKER_02\n We didn't make any.\n\n0:00:34\tSPEAKER_02\n We should say that one.\n\n0:00:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Didn't we just do that?\n\n0:00:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, safe in the folder.\n\n0:00:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Safe as...\n\n0:00:42\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, no, that's just one big document so you can leave that whatever it is.\n\n0:00:45\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh.\n\n0:00:46\tSPEAKER_05\n And we have a...\n\n0:00:49\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, I'll turn it off.\n\n0:00:56\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, not many documents this time.\n\n0:00:58\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, yes.\n\n0:00:59\tSPEAKER_05\n I have it open myself, I guess.\n\n0:01:03\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, the detailed design meeting.\n\n0:01:06\tSPEAKER_05\n We're finally getting somewhere.\n\n0:01:09\tSPEAKER_05\n What are we going to do?\n\n0:01:11\tSPEAKER_05\n I've opened it already.\n\n0:01:13\tSPEAKER_05\n I'm still going to take some minutes.\n\n0:01:16\tSPEAKER_05\n And if I'm right, you two are going to give a product representation.\n\n0:01:20\tSPEAKER_05\n Where are we going?\n\n0:01:21\tSPEAKER_05\n Aren't you?\n\n0:01:22\tSPEAKER_05\n And did you do something with evaluation criteria?\n\n0:01:26\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:01:27\tSPEAKER_05\n Good.\n\n0:01:28\tSPEAKER_05\n We have a correct agenda.\n\n0:01:30\tSPEAKER_05\n And then we have to look at something which is less nice, the finance aspect, where we can afford what we have designed.\n\n0:01:38\tSPEAKER_05\n And if we can, we can...\n\n0:01:41\tSPEAKER_05\n The final part, which is the production or project evaluation, how did we work together and what are the results and how happy are we with those?\n\n0:01:50\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, well, finance will be later.\n\n0:01:52\tSPEAKER_05\n Now I have to give you a word too.\n\n0:01:54\tSPEAKER_05\n You too.\n\n0:01:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:01:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:01:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Get up, Stato.\n\n0:02:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Hey, Ruz.\n\n0:02:02\tSPEAKER_01\n We made a prototype.\n\n0:02:04\tSPEAKER_01\n We first start with the overall...\n\n0:02:07\tSPEAKER_01\n This is about the total remote control.\n\n0:02:11\tSPEAKER_01\n We made it green.\n\n0:02:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Just an example color.\n\n0:02:14\tSPEAKER_02\n So there's one of the colors we would like to see in our product.\n\n0:02:18\tSPEAKER_01\n And the screen light blue.\n\n0:02:21\tSPEAKER_01\n So this is the scroll button and the microphone on the side here under.\n\n0:02:26\tSPEAKER_01\n And the R&R logo just says R&R now.\n\n0:02:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:02:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Any questions so far?\n\n0:02:34\tSPEAKER_02\n I think the microphone...\n\n0:02:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, just an idea about how to...\n\n0:02:40\tSPEAKER_00\n That's possible.\n\n0:02:41\tSPEAKER_02\n That's possible.\n\n0:02:42\tSPEAKER_02\n That's possible.\n\n0:02:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, it's an idea.\n\n0:02:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Perhaps you should make it a bit big so people know it there.\n\n0:02:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Do not forget it.\n\n0:02:50\tSPEAKER_02\n The function, it doesn't really have to be small.\n\n0:02:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Big, of course.\n\n0:02:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:02:55\tSPEAKER_02\n The microphone could be just a minor hole on the left button.\n\n0:03:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:03:02\tSPEAKER_02\n We also made some ideas about how the options menu would work.\n\n0:03:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Using the scroll button on the sides.\n\n0:03:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Good up.\n\n0:03:14\tSPEAKER_01\n You push the scroll button.\n\n0:03:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, you push the scroll button.\n\n0:03:16\tSPEAKER_01\n And it's claps out.\n\n0:03:17\tSPEAKER_01\n If you press down.\n\n0:03:18\tSPEAKER_02\n And it drops down menu or a full out menu comes out.\n\n0:03:21\tSPEAKER_02\n And you get the options becoming available.\n\n0:03:24\tSPEAKER_02\n For example, TV settings.\n\n0:03:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Remote settings.\n\n0:03:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Remote settings, etc.\n\n0:03:30\tSPEAKER_02\n So you can scroll down to with the scroll button.\n\n0:03:33\tSPEAKER_02\n As you can see, it's here.\n\n0:03:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Just push it in.\n\n0:03:37\tSPEAKER_02\n The menu comes out like this.\n\n0:03:40\tSPEAKER_02\n And it all becomes visible.\n\n0:03:43\tSPEAKER_01\n You could also touch it so that it comes out.\n\n0:03:46\tSPEAKER_01\n And use the scroll being as a...\n\n0:03:49\tSPEAKER_01\n What you think is...\n\n0:03:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Indeed.\n\n0:03:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:03:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:03:53\tSPEAKER_02\n It's also nice to see that we made a small menu.\n\n0:03:58\tSPEAKER_02\n The options menu becoming available when pressing the scroll button.\n\n0:04:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Any opportunity to use the tail text, which is used, which is still be used.\n\n0:04:08\tSPEAKER_02\n And we think that it's very handy to put it not under the options menu, but in a separate button.\n\n0:04:19\tSPEAKER_02\n In a separate button, yeah.\n\n0:04:21\tSPEAKER_01\n That's what you should use the teletext sign.\n\n0:04:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Sign in.\n\n0:04:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:04:26\tSPEAKER_02\n You can modify that layer.\n\n0:04:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:04:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Should I make any comments about it next time?\n\n0:04:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, this is the total interface of the LCD screen.\n\n0:04:36\tSPEAKER_01\n The numbers, which is pretty straightforward.\n\n0:04:39\tSPEAKER_01\n We put an extra button in.\n\n0:04:41\tSPEAKER_01\n We can erase it.\n\n0:04:42\tSPEAKER_01\n But it's the button where you can switch channels.\n\n0:04:45\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, just when you are on one and you go to two, you go to five.\n\n0:04:50\tSPEAKER_01\n You can go back to one with that button.\n\n0:04:52\tSPEAKER_01\n You can just press it.\n\n0:04:53\tSPEAKER_01\n It has an error.\n\n0:04:55\tSPEAKER_01\n We put that in.\n\n0:04:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Thought it would be handy here.\n\n0:04:59\tSPEAKER_01\n This is the one number, two numbers, better.\n\n0:05:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Below that, the page and the sound.\n\n0:05:05\tSPEAKER_01\n And in the middle, the mute.\n\n0:05:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Battery indicator.\n\n0:05:12\tSPEAKER_01\n It's quite large.\n\n0:05:14\tSPEAKER_01\n And this is the on-off button.\n\n0:05:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Stand by.\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Or at least it should look like it.\n\n0:05:22\tSPEAKER_01\n And the options, the tail text.\n\n0:05:24\tSPEAKER_02\n You can see clearly now that the tail text and options menu isn't taking much part of the screen.\n\n0:05:34\tSPEAKER_02\n So it's very...\n\n0:05:36\tSPEAKER_02\n When you usually doesn't become irritating to see.\n\n0:05:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Because if you put it on the top, you always get to see the options menu.\n\n0:05:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Because people regularly read from left to right.\n\n0:05:48\tSPEAKER_02\n That's it.\n\n0:05:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, that's about it.\n\n0:05:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:05:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:55\tNone\n Thank you.\n\n0:05:56\tSPEAKER_01\n I will put that on the...\n\n0:05:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Nice, man.\n\n0:06:01\tSPEAKER_05\n When I was typing the RR stands for...\n\n0:06:04\tSPEAKER_01\n That's the logo of the...\n\n0:06:06\tSPEAKER_01\n It's the...\n\n0:06:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:06:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Right now it's only RR, isn't it?\n\n0:06:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Full screen.\n\n0:06:12\tSPEAKER_05\n I would have recognized it if we were to write collars.\n\n0:06:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Sorry.\n\n0:06:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:06:20\tSPEAKER_04\n If you were to write it in the criteria, evaluation.\n\n0:06:24\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:06:25\tSPEAKER_04\n My task was this time to put up a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we could...\n\n0:06:38\tSPEAKER_04\n Requirements from the...of the users.\n\n0:06:41\tSPEAKER_04\n My name, my job.\n\n0:06:43\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:06:44\tSPEAKER_04\n My name.\n\n0:06:45\tSPEAKER_04\n Method.\n\n0:06:46\tSPEAKER_04\n Questionnaire with 7 points skill from 1 to 7 from 2 false.\n\n0:06:51\tSPEAKER_04\n Like a question, is it not big enough?\n\n0:06:54\tSPEAKER_04\n We can say it's true or false by steps.\n\n0:06:59\tSPEAKER_04\n One means absolutely not true.\n\n0:07:01\tSPEAKER_04\n Seven means true.\n\n0:07:05\tSPEAKER_04\n The three important things of...\n\n0:07:08\tSPEAKER_04\n You used the PowerPoint.\n\n0:07:11\tSPEAKER_04\n The format of this year is...\n\n0:07:13\tSPEAKER_04\n Is the remote control fancy enough?\n\n0:07:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Is it innovative enough?\n\n0:07:18\tSPEAKER_04\n And is it easy enough to use?\n\n0:07:22\tSPEAKER_04\n And then the evaluation itself?\n\n0:07:30\tSPEAKER_02\n What?\n\n0:07:32\tSPEAKER_04\n So...\n\n0:07:33\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:07:34\tSPEAKER_04\n First question.\n\n0:07:36\tSPEAKER_04\n Is the design fancy enough?\n\n0:07:39\tSPEAKER_04\n Project venture.\n\n0:07:40\tSPEAKER_04\n What do you think?\n\n0:07:41\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, it looks fancy.\n\n0:07:43\tSPEAKER_04\n Actually, with the green color.\n\n0:07:45\tSPEAKER_05\n And the curves which we decided.\n\n0:07:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:50\tSPEAKER_05\n Only what happened to the single curve?\n\n0:07:53\tSPEAKER_02\n No, the single curve idea was...\n\n0:07:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:07:59\tSPEAKER_02\n You should make the sideways.\n\n0:08:01\tSPEAKER_02\n The sideways view.\n\n0:08:03\tSPEAKER_01\n I guess.\n\n0:08:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, not that bend.\n\n0:08:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Not that bend.\n\n0:08:09\tSPEAKER_05\n Smart word.\n\n0:08:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Can I draw here?\n\n0:08:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Sposal.\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:08:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Something like this from the side.\n\n0:08:23\tSPEAKER_01\n But with a bit of a curve here, right?\n\n0:08:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's a single curve indeed.\n\n0:08:28\tSPEAKER_01\n So if you flip it like this.\n\n0:08:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Here, it's not very...\n\n0:08:33\tSPEAKER_02\n It's also very handy if you make a side curve.\n\n0:08:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Way to make the remote control very thin at the bottom.\n\n0:08:40\tSPEAKER_02\n At the bottom.\n\n0:08:41\tSPEAKER_02\n And make it rather thick on the top, because on the top it has the screen, which takes in some space.\n\n0:08:49\tSPEAKER_02\n And the batteries can be located over there.\n\n0:08:51\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:08:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Let's make the back of this part a bit bigger.\n\n0:08:54\tSPEAKER_01\n So that the place...\n\n0:08:55\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, it's going to be a little bit heavy at the top.\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's hope now.\n\n0:08:59\tSPEAKER_01\n That's a bit of fall on the roof.\n\n0:09:01\tSPEAKER_04\n With two batteries, the whole grid plate at the top.\n\n0:09:04\tSPEAKER_04\n And if you were holding it...\n\n0:09:06\tSPEAKER_01\n I think the batteries should be in here.\n\n0:09:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Because it's just nothing.\n\n0:09:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, energy.\n\n0:09:11\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:12\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, but we have to rate.\n\n0:09:13\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, we have to rate.\n\n0:09:15\tSPEAKER_04\n Is this sign of face enough?\n\n0:09:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Two?\n\n0:09:17\tSPEAKER_04\n It's a one.\n\n0:09:18\tSPEAKER_04\n Four, this is a seven.\n\n0:09:20\tSPEAKER_04\n So fancy enough means...\n\n0:09:23\tSPEAKER_04\n Thus, it comes to the younger people and the elderly people.\n\n0:09:27\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's pretty fancy.\n\n0:09:29\tSPEAKER_01\n It doesn't make it green than the older people want.\n\n0:09:31\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, you have to green all the colors.\n\n0:09:33\tSPEAKER_04\n Don't get better than that much now.\n\n0:09:35\tSPEAKER_04\n It's all designed.\n\n0:09:37\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it does.\n\n0:09:38\tSPEAKER_05\n And it does.\n\n0:09:40\tSPEAKER_05\n I think that's because of the microphone and also the screen.\n\n0:09:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I don't know whether older people will use it.\n\n0:09:44\tSPEAKER_05\n It's a new thing.\n\n0:09:45\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, so...\n\n0:09:46\tSPEAKER_01\n I will make it a two or something.\n\n0:09:48\tSPEAKER_03\n A two?\n\n0:09:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:50\tSPEAKER_03\n I'd say it.\n\n0:09:51\tSPEAKER_03\n It's true, it's a one.\n\n0:09:53\tSPEAKER_01\n All right, it's a one.\n\n0:09:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Very fancy.\n\n0:09:55\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a one.\n\n0:09:57\tSPEAKER_05\n A little bit strange, we have to adjust that ourselves.\n\n0:10:00\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, I should use that one, but it doesn't.\n\n0:10:05\tSPEAKER_01\n But it's a one.\n\n0:10:06\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, now it's two.\n\n0:10:08\tSPEAKER_04\n True is a one.\n\n0:10:09\tSPEAKER_04\n Where is the true is a one?\n\n0:10:10\tSPEAKER_04\n Where is the true?\n\n0:10:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Are they pink?\n\n0:10:13\tSPEAKER_01\n It's very true.\n\n0:10:14\tSPEAKER_02\n It's very true.\n\n0:10:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Because we designed it to be very fancy.\n\n0:10:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but...\n\n0:10:18\tSPEAKER_02\n It's very fancy, I think.\n\n0:10:19\tSPEAKER_02\n If you have a scene that's a remote control like this.\n\n0:10:21\tSPEAKER_05\n No, okay.\n\n0:10:22\tSPEAKER_05\n No, it's fancy.\n\n0:10:24\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:26\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, one, two.\n\n0:10:28\tSPEAKER_04\n Let's give it a two.\n\n0:10:31\tSPEAKER_04\n Is it innovative?\n\n0:10:33\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it is.\n\n0:10:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Because it has an SD-screen, a microphone.\n\n0:10:37\tSPEAKER_01\n And a server.\n\n0:10:39\tSPEAKER_01\n It's from Robert.\n\n0:10:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:41\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a scroll.\n\n0:10:42\tSPEAKER_02\n It's an after-school screen.\n\n0:10:43\tSPEAKER_03\n It's the one.\n\n0:10:44\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it's the one.\n\n0:10:45\tNone\n It's the one, yeah.\n\n0:10:46\tSPEAKER_04\n True.\n\n0:10:47\tSPEAKER_04\n Also...\n\n0:10:49\tSPEAKER_04\n The buttons are easy to find.\n\n0:10:52\tSPEAKER_04\n That was a big requirement of the old people.\n\n0:10:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Because they're right on your screen.\n\n0:10:59\tSPEAKER_01\n So you can use the...\n\n0:11:04\tSPEAKER_01\n They're right on your screen, so I don't know where you would...\n\n0:11:07\tSPEAKER_01\n With the ones on the buttons.\n\n0:11:08\tSPEAKER_04\n It's easy to find.\n\n0:11:09\tSPEAKER_04\n Not only this button, it's all the buttons.\n\n0:11:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:12\tSPEAKER_01\n I think they are.\n\n0:11:16\tSPEAKER_01\n The options are a little bit harder, but if you...\n\n0:11:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Take the heart out, okay.\n\n0:11:20\tSPEAKER_04\n Sure.\n\n0:11:21\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's easier than the regular remote control.\n\n0:11:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I think this is easy to find.\n\n0:11:27\tSPEAKER_04\n I think the options buttons are not the easiest way to...\n\n0:11:34\tSPEAKER_01\n No, they're not, but they're easy to find.\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_03\n True.\n\n0:11:40\tSPEAKER_02\n They are a lot easier to find than...\n\n0:11:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Then on the regular remote controls, where you have to find out what which sign or icon means on the A3 button.\n\n0:11:51\tSPEAKER_02\n That's true.\n\n0:11:52\tSPEAKER_02\n So you have to use the manual to understand...\n\n0:11:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Next.\n\n0:11:57\tSPEAKER_05\n Which number are we going?\n\n0:11:59\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's a two.\n\n0:12:01\tSPEAKER_02\n At least.\n\n0:12:03\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, it's two, yeah.\n\n0:12:04\tSPEAKER_04\n Two, three.\n\n0:12:05\tSPEAKER_04\n It's not perfect, but I think it's a three.\n\n0:12:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Three?\n\n0:12:09\tSPEAKER_02\n And why is that?\n\n0:12:10\tSPEAKER_04\n Because I don't think...\n\n0:12:12\tSPEAKER_04\n Maybe it's easy to find right away.\n\n0:12:17\tSPEAKER_04\n I think if you have the button at the right, I don't think you can find the option button.\n\n0:12:21\tSPEAKER_01\n But if you want it, you have to use the button at the right.\n\n0:12:23\tSPEAKER_01\n You can touch it.\n\n0:12:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Instead both the options...\n\n0:12:28\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, but then you have written option on here, the tail of the text button.\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:34\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, then I think also to you.\n\n0:12:36\tSPEAKER_01\n You can touch the option and it comes back.\n\n0:12:38\tSPEAKER_02\n I do, I do.\n\n0:12:39\tSPEAKER_02\n The next question.\n\n0:12:41\tSPEAKER_02\n The next question.\n\n0:12:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh my god.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_05\n What about you?\n\n0:12:45\tSPEAKER_05\n Two, resulting one question.\n\n0:12:47\tSPEAKER_05\n It's different.\n\n0:12:49\tSPEAKER_04\n It's easy to use as well for younger elderly people.\n\n0:12:53\tSPEAKER_01\n For younger people, I think it's easy to use.\n\n0:12:56\tSPEAKER_04\n Young means 16 to 40 years.\n\n0:12:59\tSPEAKER_04\n And elderly from 40 years to their death.\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's the most useful remote control ever to be manufactured.\n\n0:13:07\tSPEAKER_05\n Very enthusiastic.\n\n0:13:09\tSPEAKER_02\n It is obviously easy to use.\n\n0:13:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, because it has the regular controls, like as you can see on the screen now.\n\n0:13:15\tSPEAKER_02\n And you don't have all the other options always on your screen.\n\n0:13:22\tSPEAKER_02\n So as things really easy to use, you want these options to...\n\n0:13:27\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, as well as you...\n\n0:13:28\tSPEAKER_04\n If you're of text, 60 years old, you're holding one of those things in your head.\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_01\n They don't want the extra options.\n\n0:13:35\tSPEAKER_04\n No, but we're going to make this for all kinds of people.\n\n0:13:38\tSPEAKER_05\n And all the ways we could use the speech recognition.\n\n0:13:41\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it is.\n\n0:13:42\tSPEAKER_01\n If they read the manual.\n\n0:13:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Because they're fine.\n\n0:13:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, perhaps that is one of the most...\n\n0:13:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Because a lot of youth...\n\n0:13:49\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not difficult. You say...\n\n0:13:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Genre 1 and Genre 4.\n\n0:13:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:54\tSPEAKER_01\n To the speech recognition.\n\n0:13:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Then you say the question and the answer.\n\n0:13:58\tSPEAKER_01\n And that's everything it does to the speech recognition.\n\n0:14:02\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, well maybe that would make it even more easy to use.\n\n0:14:06\tSPEAKER_05\n I think it would be...\n\n0:14:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I think it does.\n\n0:14:08\tSPEAKER_02\n So, because all the people who can't...\n\n0:14:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Make it too.\n\n0:14:11\tSPEAKER_04\n Also, to...\n\n0:14:12\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:13\tSPEAKER_04\n Another session for this...\n\n0:14:15\tSPEAKER_04\n I chose 3.\n\n0:14:16\tSPEAKER_04\n 3?\n\n0:14:17\tSPEAKER_04\n I would also say 3.\n\n0:14:19\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, you have 3, 3, 2, 2, 1.\n\n0:14:21\tSPEAKER_05\n 2.\n\n0:14:22\tSPEAKER_05\n So, what are we going to do?\n\n0:14:24\tSPEAKER_05\n 2 and all.\n\n0:14:25\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, 3, I see.\n\n0:14:26\tSPEAKER_05\n Give me more.\n\n0:14:28\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't know, question.\n\n0:14:30\tSPEAKER_04\n We both overwhelmed with buttons.\n\n0:14:32\tSPEAKER_04\n No.\n\n0:14:33\tSPEAKER_04\n No.\n\n0:14:34\tSPEAKER_04\n No.\n\n0:14:35\tSPEAKER_04\n No, that's...\n\n0:14:36\tSPEAKER_01\n That's the one.\n\n0:14:37\tSPEAKER_01\n I think that's the left one.\n\n0:14:38\tSPEAKER_01\n There's definitely a...\n\n0:14:39\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, the 7 is it?\n\n0:14:40\tSPEAKER_01\n It is.\n\n0:14:41\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:14:42\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, the most one.\n\n0:14:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, but I think you should make it one scale with one thing good.\n\n0:14:45\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:46\tSPEAKER_04\n It doesn't...\n\n0:14:47\tSPEAKER_05\n It doesn't be...\n\n0:14:48\tSPEAKER_00\n It doesn't...\n\n0:14:49\tSPEAKER_05\n It doesn't sound like...\n\n0:14:50\tSPEAKER_02\n It doesn't overwhelmed.\n\n0:14:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:53\tSPEAKER_05\n So...\n\n0:14:54\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:56\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:14:57\tSPEAKER_04\n All right.\n\n0:14:58\tSPEAKER_04\n Designed for you.\n\n0:14:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Rural...\n\n0:15:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Through all this colors.\n\n0:15:01\tSPEAKER_01\n The different...\n\n0:15:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:15:04\tSPEAKER_05\n This will make them in different colors.\n\n0:15:05\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:06\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, this option.\n\n0:15:07\tSPEAKER_05\n That's true.\n\n0:15:08\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:09\tSPEAKER_01\n I thought we had about single colors, but you can also make a wood color.\n\n0:15:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Not just one single color, but the wood.\n\n0:15:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Like...\n\n0:15:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Also with the rubber.\n\n0:15:14\tSPEAKER_05\n I think you've got...\n\n0:15:15\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:15:16\tSPEAKER_05\n It feels like we're gonna make a print on rubber, can't you?\n\n0:15:19\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:15:20\tSPEAKER_01\n But then when you square two is us, come on.\n\n0:15:22\tSPEAKER_01\n That's the one?\n\n0:15:23\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, it is harder to...\n\n0:15:25\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, many questions.\n\n0:15:26\tSPEAKER_04\n I have...\n\n0:15:27\tSPEAKER_04\n Two.\n\n0:15:28\tSPEAKER_05\n Uh, okay.\n\n0:15:29\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, we have time.\n\n0:15:30\tSPEAKER_05\n We're getting paid.\n\n0:15:32\tSPEAKER_02\n We're getting paid.\n\n0:15:33\tSPEAKER_02\n We're getting paid.\n\n0:15:34\tSPEAKER_04\n You're so much cheaper than that.\n\n0:15:35\tSPEAKER_04\n That's a one, that's rubber.\n\n0:15:36\tSPEAKER_04\n What can I use to use?\n\n0:15:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, yeah, it's very spun.\n\n0:15:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I...\n\n0:15:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, no, it's not very spun.\n\n0:15:41\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not the most spun-cheese thing.\n\n0:15:43\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's a three.\n\n0:15:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it's a three.\n\n0:15:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Because you want to make it a rather flexible, but not too flexible, because it has an\n\n0:15:51\tSPEAKER_00\n else-a-E screen. Yeah.\n\n0:15:53\tSPEAKER_04\n How about contrasting hard to lose?\n\n0:15:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, you could...\n\n0:15:57\tSPEAKER_04\n You could go...\n\n0:15:58\tSPEAKER_04\n You can lose it if you're 60 years old.\n\n0:16:02\tSPEAKER_04\n You first, I'll see the thing, you didn't just set the microphone and then you lose it.\n\n0:16:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Then you have lost it.\n\n0:16:08\tSPEAKER_01\n You can lose it, but it isn't hard to lose.\n\n0:16:10\tSPEAKER_04\n It is a dark now.\n\n0:16:11\tSPEAKER_04\n I think this is a two, personally.\n\n0:16:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Two.\n\n0:16:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Is it hard to lose?\n\n0:16:15\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:16:16\tSPEAKER_01\n It isn't hard to lose.\n\n0:16:17\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a six.\n\n0:16:18\tSPEAKER_01\n You think?\n\n0:16:19\tSPEAKER_03\n It isn't hard to lose.\n\n0:16:20\tSPEAKER_03\n So it's a two.\n\n0:16:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, you can lose it, so I don't know.\n\n0:16:22\tSPEAKER_01\n You can't lose it.\n\n0:16:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:24\tSPEAKER_01\n You can't lose it.\n\n0:16:25\tSPEAKER_01\n It doesn't matter.\n\n0:16:26\tSPEAKER_01\n You're 60 years old.\n\n0:16:27\tSPEAKER_01\n You're a hard-to-lose.\n\n0:16:28\tSPEAKER_00\n A hard-to-lose is good.\n\n0:16:29\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:16:30\tSPEAKER_05\n The question should be hard to lose.\n\n0:16:31\tSPEAKER_05\n It's difficult to lose.\n\n0:16:32\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, right.\n\n0:16:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, this is hard to lose.\n\n0:16:34\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, so then it is almost true.\n\n0:16:36\tSPEAKER_01\n So a two.\n\n0:16:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I think also.\n\n0:16:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Two.\n\n0:16:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:40\tSPEAKER_01\n So a two.\n\n0:16:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I think it's hard to lose.\n\n0:16:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I think also.\n\n0:16:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Two.\n\n0:16:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:16:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Most of it because of the option two.\n\n0:16:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Whoa.\n\n0:16:49\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, it's okay that happened above also.\n\n0:16:52\tSPEAKER_05\n Maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal.\n\n0:16:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, no.\n\n0:16:56\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, it doesn't.\n\n0:16:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, actually, I remember you put the cursor in another table.\n\n0:17:00\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, okay.\n\n0:17:01\tSPEAKER_04\n What can though mainly be salt to younger people?\n\n0:17:03\tSPEAKER_04\n True.\n\n0:17:04\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it will.\n\n0:17:05\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, true.\n\n0:17:06\tSPEAKER_04\n Very true.\n\n0:17:07\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:08\tSPEAKER_00\n No, I don't think very true because the colors.\n\n0:17:10\tSPEAKER_04\n We have the colors.\n\n0:17:13\tSPEAKER_04\n We have the buttons aren't that much.\n\n0:17:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Materials.\n\n0:17:17\tSPEAKER_04\n No, the material isn't that.\n\n0:17:19\tSPEAKER_04\n It's much more.\n\n0:17:20\tSPEAKER_04\n So I think it's a three.\n\n0:17:23\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, I think it's a lower number.\n\n0:17:26\tSPEAKER_05\n So better because we designed it for young people especially.\n\n0:17:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but I.\n\n0:17:31\tSPEAKER_03\n What do you think?\n\n0:17:33\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it's true.\n\n0:17:35\tSPEAKER_02\n I think two, two, two, two.\n\n0:17:38\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, that's very good.\n\n0:17:40\tSPEAKER_05\n The features.\n\n0:17:41\tSPEAKER_05\n The satisfying younger people.\n\n0:17:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Younger people.\n\n0:17:44\tSPEAKER_00\n No, perhaps not.\n\n0:17:45\tSPEAKER_04\n What?\n\n0:17:46\tSPEAKER_04\n Because younger people are critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing.\n\n0:17:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, not exactly, but if it had some games on it or something like that.\n\n0:17:55\tSPEAKER_02\n But it's for remote control, I think.\n\n0:17:58\tSPEAKER_02\n I think the likes these.\n\n0:18:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, the speech possibility of color.\n\n0:18:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, the screen.\n\n0:18:04\tSPEAKER_02\n The scroll option.\n\n0:18:05\tSPEAKER_04\n I think they'll be quite met with their expectations.\n\n0:18:10\tSPEAKER_05\n Those are more fancy functions, not really many features or something.\n\n0:18:14\tSPEAKER_05\n I mean, those are features.\n\n0:18:16\tSPEAKER_04\n There's three features, basically.\n\n0:18:18\tSPEAKER_04\n LC9, LC9, LC9 touch screen is feature.\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:22\tSPEAKER_04\n The microphone is feature.\n\n0:18:23\tSPEAKER_01\n The microphone is feature and that you can change the channel's feature and that you can change the volume of the feature.\n\n0:18:28\tSPEAKER_01\n And that you can change the options of the remote.\n\n0:18:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I think.\n\n0:18:31\tSPEAKER_04\n I think then you have the volume up.\n\n0:18:33\tSPEAKER_02\n The volume up.\n\n0:18:35\tSPEAKER_02\n The video's a bit different.\n\n0:18:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Younger people usually use remote control to put on the volume.\n\n0:18:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:41\tSPEAKER_04\n Turn on.\n\n0:18:42\tSPEAKER_04\n I think it's one.\n\n0:18:44\tSPEAKER_04\n And not feature.\n\n0:18:45\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, I think because you have channel features, you have the screen features, audio features.\n\n0:18:51\tSPEAKER_04\n You have all buttons on it.\n\n0:18:53\tSPEAKER_04\n Which would like the microphone extra, LCD screen extra, scroll thing extra.\n\n0:18:58\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:59\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, you think one, what do you think?\n\n0:19:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Two or three.\n\n0:19:03\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:04\tSPEAKER_05\n Two.\n\n0:19:05\tSPEAKER_05\n I'd say three.\n\n0:19:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Two, make it two.\n\n0:19:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Make it two.\n\n0:19:08\tSPEAKER_00\n One, two, three.\n\n0:19:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, make it two.\n\n0:19:10\tSPEAKER_04\n You can see the remote controls, the R&R.\n\n0:19:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, there's R&R in front.\n\n0:19:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n0:19:16\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not the colors, maybe you make two, but it has R&R.\n\n0:19:20\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, yeah, it did have, now you have the black one.\n\n0:19:23\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:24\tSPEAKER_04\n And we probably make also yellow one.\n\n0:19:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:26\tSPEAKER_01\n But not R&R.\n\n0:19:27\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, maybe two.\n\n0:19:28\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, true, yeah.\n\n0:19:31\tSPEAKER_04\n And the menu that is available is easy to use.\n\n0:19:36\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it is, but I don't know what you think.\n\n0:19:39\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's easy to use than a regular remote control.\n\n0:19:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Because when you push on the options menu, you get the various options entirely explained, entirely explained.\n\n0:19:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Instead of just finding out what an icon means on a button.\n\n0:19:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:58\tSPEAKER_01\n And you can have it easier.\n\n0:19:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, you can have it with the, you have to push the arrows and with the normal to be remote.\n\n0:20:05\tSPEAKER_03\n I think that would be quite hard to learn.\n\n0:20:10\tSPEAKER_03\n You're not satisfied.\n\n0:20:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, let's start over again.\n\n0:20:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's make it different.\n\n0:20:15\tSPEAKER_04\n Let's go for menu.\n\n0:20:18\tSPEAKER_04\n I think it would be a, there too.\n\n0:20:21\tSPEAKER_04\n Not more.\n\n0:20:22\tSPEAKER_04\n I see.\n\n0:20:23\tSPEAKER_05\n We only have two.\n\n0:20:24\tSPEAKER_05\n That's pretty good.\n\n0:20:25\tSPEAKER_05\n All right, I think so.\n\n0:20:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:28\tSPEAKER_03\n So, okay, we have, one three or one that have to cut open.\n\n0:20:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Two three.\n\n0:20:33\tSPEAKER_03\n And have to cut open.\n\n0:20:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Two, two, two, two.\n\n0:20:37\tSPEAKER_01\n We also have two.\n\n0:20:38\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's pretty good.\n\n0:20:39\tSPEAKER_01\n The average is two.\n\n0:20:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:41\tSPEAKER_04\n That average.\n\n0:20:42\tSPEAKER_04\n Quite good.\n\n0:20:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:44\tSPEAKER_03\n In my opinion, I think so.\n\n0:20:46\tSPEAKER_01\n We can be happy.\n\n0:20:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Safe.\n\n0:20:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:20:52\tSPEAKER_01\n What is it?\n\n0:20:53\tSPEAKER_01\n It's like a bird.\n\n0:20:55\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a fly.\n\n0:20:56\tSPEAKER_01\n A fly.\n\n0:20:57\tSPEAKER_01\n A butterfly.\n\n0:20:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Good or fly?\n\n0:21:00\tNone\n That's it.\n\n0:21:01\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:21:02\tSPEAKER_00\n That was your evaluation.\n\n0:21:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:21:05\tSPEAKER_05\n Show.\n\n0:21:06\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:21:07\tSPEAKER_05\n We don't have to calculate anything because of that.\n\n0:21:10\tSPEAKER_05\n No, it's two.\n\n0:21:11\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:21:12\tSPEAKER_04\n Good.\n\n0:21:13\tSPEAKER_05\n That's two.\n\n0:21:14\tSPEAKER_05\n Let's see.\n\n0:21:15\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, we didn't ask to save.\n\n0:21:16\tSPEAKER_05\n We didn't want to run you.\n\n0:21:17\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:18\tSPEAKER_04\n I saved it.\n\n0:21:19\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:21:20\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, the next part might be a little bit difficult to do in a group, but I am willing to try it.\n\n0:21:34\tSPEAKER_05\n Because we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice excel sheet to do that.\n\n0:21:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Really, sign.\n\n0:21:41\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:21:42\tSPEAKER_05\n I'm not sure if I put it in the photo.\n\n0:21:45\tSPEAKER_05\n I think we are going to calculate the production costs and if they are under or at 12.050, we are good.\n\n0:21:53\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:54\tSPEAKER_05\n And if we are not, we are going to redesign.\n\n0:21:56\tSPEAKER_01\n We are going to erase it very quickly.\n\n0:21:58\tSPEAKER_05\n I think yes.\n\n0:21:59\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't know.\n\n0:22:00\tSPEAKER_05\n Do you have the cost or put the excel sheet in the...\n\n0:22:04\tSPEAKER_05\n Let's hope.\n\n0:22:05\tSPEAKER_01\n We are going to make a clock.\n\n0:22:08\tSPEAKER_05\n I think it's still in my own documents folder.\n\n0:22:14\tSPEAKER_01\n We are going to be around 8 o'clock.\n\n0:22:17\tSPEAKER_01\n I doubt it.\n\n0:22:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Perhaps we have got features that don't exist in the excel sheet.\n\n0:22:23\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe...\n\n0:22:25\tSPEAKER_03\n The microphone.\n\n0:22:26\tSPEAKER_03\n No, it wasn't in my information.\n\n0:22:29\tSPEAKER_03\n It wasn't too much.\n\n0:22:30\tSPEAKER_02\n No, but maybe I got...\n\n0:22:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Of course, the else discrain.\n\n0:22:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh.\n\n0:22:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:22:34\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, this is it.\n\n0:22:35\tSPEAKER_05\n Maybe I could ask one of you to fill it in so that I can also take minutes.\n\n0:22:40\tSPEAKER_05\n And maybe the other can use that thing to count numerous functions.\n\n0:22:46\tSPEAKER_05\n But you shoot the...\n\n0:22:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Count it.\n\n0:22:48\tSPEAKER_05\n Like right...\n\n0:22:49\tSPEAKER_05\n No, we have to count some things and we have to think about some things.\n\n0:22:51\tSPEAKER_05\n Count it.\n\n0:22:52\tSPEAKER_02\n You've got to excel to count.\n\n0:22:53\tSPEAKER_02\n The number of...\n\n0:22:54\tSPEAKER_05\n No, a count number of functions.\n\n0:22:57\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, okay.\n\n0:22:58\tSPEAKER_02\n I draw a different screen.\n\n0:22:59\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll do that because I draw the screen.\n\n0:23:02\tSPEAKER_01\n We've got a battery.\n\n0:23:03\tSPEAKER_01\n One is two batteries.\n\n0:23:05\tSPEAKER_01\n And I want battery.\n\n0:23:06\tSPEAKER_01\n But two small batteries.\n\n0:23:08\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:10\tSPEAKER_05\n It's more about the energy source.\n\n0:23:11\tSPEAKER_05\n Do you use a hand dynamo or battery?\n\n0:23:12\tSPEAKER_01\n What do you use for solar cell?\n\n0:23:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Solar cell, no.\n\n0:23:15\tSPEAKER_01\n No, no, solar cell.\n\n0:23:16\tSPEAKER_01\n No, no, no, no.\n\n0:23:17\tSPEAKER_01\n One battery.\n\n0:23:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Right?\n\n0:23:19\tSPEAKER_02\n No hand dynamo.\n\n0:23:20\tSPEAKER_02\n And...\n\n0:23:21\tSPEAKER_01\n And it's running simple chip, right?\n\n0:23:25\tSPEAKER_04\n No, we have simple chip.\n\n0:23:26\tSPEAKER_04\n An advanced chip.\n\n0:23:27\tSPEAKER_04\n But we also have simple speaker tools.\n\n0:23:29\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:30\tSPEAKER_01\n So this one...\n\n0:23:31\tSPEAKER_01\n And this one...\n\n0:23:33\tSPEAKER_01\n We're already on mine.\n\n0:23:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Single...\n\n0:23:36\tSPEAKER_01\n What?\n\n0:23:37\tSPEAKER_01\n R-E, oh yay.\n\n0:23:38\tSPEAKER_04\n We have double curved.\n\n0:23:39\tSPEAKER_04\n Single, nice single curved.\n\n0:23:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Single curved.\n\n0:23:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Single curved as...\n\n0:23:42\tSPEAKER_02\n As you...\n\n0:23:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Three dimensional.\n\n0:23:44\tSPEAKER_02\n But it isn't three dimensional.\n\n0:23:46\tSPEAKER_02\n It isn't curved in...\n\n0:23:47\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not going to work, right, people.\n\n0:23:48\tSPEAKER_01\n We have to rubber.\n\n0:23:49\tSPEAKER_04\n It's going to curved like this, right?\n\n0:23:50\tSPEAKER_04\n It's curved like this.\n\n0:23:51\tSPEAKER_04\n No, no, no, no.\n\n0:23:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Single curved is like this.\n\n0:23:53\tSPEAKER_02\n No, no, no, no.\n\n0:23:54\tSPEAKER_00\n It's curved like this.\n\n0:23:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:56\tSPEAKER_02\n That's the only curve you made.\n\n0:23:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Not curved like this.\n\n0:23:58\tSPEAKER_02\n That's...\n\n0:23:59\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, but we have curved like this, isn't it?\n\n0:24:00\tSPEAKER_04\n The two curved...\n\n0:24:01\tSPEAKER_04\n 13.\n\n0:24:02\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, okay.\n\n0:24:03\tSPEAKER_01\n I just said.\n\n0:24:04\tSPEAKER_01\n What is the scroll wheel, right?\n\n0:24:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Rubber.\n\n0:24:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Is it integrated?\n\n0:24:07\tSPEAKER_01\n No, it's...\n\n0:24:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Push it.\n\n0:24:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, we don't have push.\n\n0:24:10\tSPEAKER_02\n We got to integrate it's color wheel and push button.\n\n0:24:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Because when you push it, we want to just pull it in the middle.\n\n0:24:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, yeah, right.\n\n0:24:16\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not...\n\n0:24:17\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not going to work.\n\n0:24:18\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not going to work.\n\n0:24:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:24:20\tSPEAKER_01\n We're 15, not too bad.\n\n0:24:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, um...\n\n0:24:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, but the special color, yeah.\n\n0:24:24\tSPEAKER_01\n The special form, right?\n\n0:24:25\tSPEAKER_02\n But now button supplements.\n\n0:24:26\tSPEAKER_02\n We don't got a button supplement.\n\n0:24:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, we don't have any buttons.\n\n0:24:29\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:24:30\tSPEAKER_01\n 80.5.\n\n0:24:31\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, we need to...\n\n0:24:32\tSPEAKER_04\n We have to lower it with...\n\n0:24:33\tSPEAKER_04\n Six points.\n\n0:24:34\tSPEAKER_04\n No, 15.\n\n0:24:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:24:36\tSPEAKER_01\n 12 and a half.\n\n0:24:37\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:24:38\tSPEAKER_01\n We could lose the curve.\n\n0:24:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:42\tSPEAKER_04\n We could use...\n\n0:24:43\tSPEAKER_04\n I'm not sure.\n\n0:24:44\tSPEAKER_02\n We could lose the scroll wheel.\n\n0:24:45\tSPEAKER_02\n We could make just a regular scroll wheel.\n\n0:24:47\tSPEAKER_01\n But you can't push it.\n\n0:24:48\tSPEAKER_01\n So you can't push it.\n\n0:24:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, you can't push it.\n\n0:24:50\tSPEAKER_02\n You have to tap the options we know.\n\n0:24:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Uh, button here.\n\n0:24:53\tSPEAKER_02\n And then scroll down with the...\n\n0:24:55\tSPEAKER_02\n With the button.\n\n0:24:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I think that will work.\n\n0:24:58\tSPEAKER_01\n So a normal scroll wheel.\n\n0:25:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, best.\n\n0:25:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Normal scroll wheel.\n\n0:25:02\tSPEAKER_01\n And I think we should...\n\n0:25:03\tSPEAKER_04\n We'll grab the sample speaker.\n\n0:25:05\tSPEAKER_04\n It's four...\n\n0:25:06\tSPEAKER_04\n Four units.\n\n0:25:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, what if you...\n\n0:25:09\tSPEAKER_01\n It is a new feature.\n\n0:25:10\tSPEAKER_01\n It's...\n\n0:25:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, so we don't exactly need to sing.\n\n0:25:13\tSPEAKER_02\n We don't need a curve.\n\n0:25:15\tSPEAKER_02\n It's possible to lose that.\n\n0:25:16\tSPEAKER_04\n It's probably...\n\n0:25:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Square.\n\n0:25:18\tSPEAKER_01\n No, then it won't stand up from the table.\n\n0:25:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Is that...\n\n0:25:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Is that mean to it?\n\n0:25:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's meant with...\n\n0:25:24\tSPEAKER_02\n What's curve?\n\n0:25:25\tSPEAKER_02\n The curve is in a dimension.\n\n0:25:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, okay.\n\n0:25:28\tSPEAKER_02\n If you make it a flat one, there's no curve.\n\n0:25:30\tSPEAKER_02\n You got no curve.\n\n0:25:31\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, but that only...\n\n0:25:33\tSPEAKER_04\n It's one.\n\n0:25:34\tSPEAKER_04\n No two.\n\n0:25:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, a bit.\n\n0:25:36\tSPEAKER_04\n No one.\n\n0:25:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Sixty-four.\n\n0:25:38\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, so we don't...\n\n0:25:40\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, we also have to...\n\n0:25:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Is it possible to make?\n\n0:25:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Could we do it on a regular chip on print or something?\n\n0:25:47\tSPEAKER_04\n Otherwise, we don't have a LCD screen.\n\n0:25:49\tSPEAKER_01\n No, you just can do that.\n\n0:25:51\tSPEAKER_05\n What did you change?\n\n0:25:52\tSPEAKER_05\n You changed the...\n\n0:25:53\tSPEAKER_05\n The scroll wheel.\n\n0:25:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, and the single curve...\n\n0:25:56\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, well, that's just one.\n\n0:25:58\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, so that doesn't...\n\n0:25:59\tSPEAKER_04\n Maybe you should...\n\n0:26:01\tSPEAKER_04\n Scrape a sample speaker.\n\n0:26:03\tSPEAKER_02\n The sample speaker is...\n\n0:26:05\tSPEAKER_04\n It's four points.\n\n0:26:06\tSPEAKER_04\n Yes, four points.\n\n0:26:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but then you can keep the curve.\n\n0:26:09\tSPEAKER_01\n It is a new feature.\n\n0:26:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it's a new feature.\n\n0:26:12\tSPEAKER_04\n When you lose, what else do you want to...\n\n0:26:14\tSPEAKER_04\n You have to...\n\n0:26:15\tSPEAKER_01\n We have to...\n\n0:26:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Four points.\n\n0:26:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, this is difficult.\n\n0:26:18\tSPEAKER_05\n Or maybe in a hand, then I'm over.\n\n0:26:20\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:21\tSPEAKER_04\n You think it would...\n\n0:26:22\tSPEAKER_04\n Instead of rubber?\n\n0:26:23\tSPEAKER_02\n No, that's...\n\n0:26:25\tSPEAKER_02\n When you make a remote control of wood...\n\n0:26:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it would make a remote control...\n\n0:26:30\tSPEAKER_04\n It would make a remote control of wood.\n\n0:26:32\tSPEAKER_04\n You can make a tape show, we said it rubber.\n\n0:26:34\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, it all stays one point less.\n\n0:26:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, but a wood and remote control only helps for...\n\n0:26:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, can I ask some people...\n\n0:26:40\tSPEAKER_01\n What is special color?\n\n0:26:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Is that the wood...\n\n0:26:44\tSPEAKER_05\n I think it is.\n\n0:26:46\tSPEAKER_05\n It needs to have that one too.\n\n0:26:48\tSPEAKER_05\n But I think the only option is to...\n\n0:26:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:51\tSPEAKER_02\n To knock the sample speaker in...\n\n0:26:53\tSPEAKER_01\n And a sample sensor.\n\n0:26:54\tSPEAKER_04\n Then we still have too much.\n\n0:26:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, okay, three points.\n\n0:26:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Of course, but...\n\n0:26:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we...\n\n0:27:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Watch 12.5.\n\n0:27:01\tSPEAKER_02\n What?\n\n0:27:02\tSPEAKER_02\n That's making 13 or 14.\n\n0:27:04\tSPEAKER_02\n We need 12.5.\n\n0:27:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, we need...\n\n0:27:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Three.\n\n0:27:07\tSPEAKER_01\n We need 0.3.\n\n0:27:09\tSPEAKER_04\n That's the scroll wheel.\n\n0:27:10\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a color.\n\n0:27:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Don't make a food.\n\n0:27:13\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, but the wood...\n\n0:27:14\tSPEAKER_04\n We can make it brown, dark brown, not the wood.\n\n0:27:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but is it special color?\n\n0:27:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Is it...\n\n0:27:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, color?\n\n0:27:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, color?\n\n0:27:21\tSPEAKER_01\n It's also green or...?\n\n0:27:23\tSPEAKER_04\n No, that's just a normal color.\n\n0:27:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but it's just a color than just rubber color.\n\n0:27:28\tSPEAKER_01\n You have to add something to the rubber to make it green.\n\n0:27:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:31\tSPEAKER_01\n You don't say here, it's green rubber.\n\n0:27:34\tSPEAKER_00\n They don't tell green rubber.\n\n0:27:35\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't think you can...\n\n0:27:36\tSPEAKER_04\n Every way...\n\n0:27:37\tSPEAKER_04\n Two or 12.5.\n\n0:27:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, you can.\n\n0:27:39\tSPEAKER_01\n You have to...\n\n0:27:40\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, then we have to scrap LCD display.\n\n0:27:42\tSPEAKER_04\n We have to scrap...\n\n0:27:43\tSPEAKER_04\n No, it's the most...\n\n0:27:45\tSPEAKER_04\n...I guess.\n\n0:27:46\tSPEAKER_04\n Then we have to scrap everything.\n\n0:27:48\tSPEAKER_04\n Because how many colors we're going to make?\n\n0:27:50\tSPEAKER_04\n Five.\n\n0:27:51\tSPEAKER_02\n If we lose the scroll wheel...\n\n0:27:52\tSPEAKER_02\n...and make it totally depending...\n\n0:27:55\tSPEAKER_02\n...depended on the touchscreen...\n\n0:27:57\tSPEAKER_02\n...then it's possible to make...\n\n0:27:59\tSPEAKER_02\n...and then you can add two colors.\n\n0:28:01\tSPEAKER_02\n And then you can add the colors.\n\n0:28:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, two colors, of course.\n\n0:28:03\tSPEAKER_02\n We did...\n\n0:28:04\tSPEAKER_02\n...special...\n\n0:28:05\tSPEAKER_02\n If you lose...\n\n0:28:06\tSPEAKER_02\n...if you lose the...\n\n0:28:09\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not such a great idea.\n\n0:28:11\tSPEAKER_02\n You do it this way.\n\n0:28:13\tSPEAKER_02\n And you get a level of 0.5.\n\n0:28:14\tSPEAKER_02\n And then you can make...\n\n0:28:16\tSPEAKER_02\n...a special single curve, for example.\n\n0:28:19\tSPEAKER_04\n And then you have two colors.\n\n0:28:22\tSPEAKER_04\n The colors, like she told...\n\n0:28:25\tSPEAKER_04\n...is that all the colors we add...\n\n0:28:28\tSPEAKER_02\n...or...\n\n0:28:29\tSPEAKER_02\n...anyway, colors.\n\n0:28:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Special colors, all the colors you want...\n\n0:28:32\tSPEAKER_04\n...because we have yellow, red, black...\n\n0:28:36\tSPEAKER_02\n...when you use more than one color, it's a special color.\n\n0:28:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:28:41\tSPEAKER_01\n But I think when you use the color that's not originally the rubber...\n\n0:28:44\tSPEAKER_01\n...then you use special color.\n\n0:28:46\tSPEAKER_04\n But the rubber is also original black.\n\n0:28:48\tSPEAKER_01\n You could make it always black.\n\n0:28:51\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, but we're going to make it yellow, red...\n\n0:28:53\tSPEAKER_04\n...and then you add...\n\n0:28:54\tSPEAKER_04\n...you have two special colors on top of the one.\n\n0:28:57\tSPEAKER_02\n We also want to make another color.\n\n0:28:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, we have to make this like four or five or something.\n\n0:29:03\tSPEAKER_04\n Because we have more colors than only black.\n\n0:29:05\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, but it isn't it.\n\n0:29:06\tSPEAKER_04\n I don't think they made me special.\n\n0:29:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Right, is it very remote?\n\n0:29:11\tSPEAKER_05\n I think it made half-per-remote.\n\n0:29:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n0:29:14\tSPEAKER_01\n And you want one color, for every remote.\n\n0:29:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, and then it is one.\n\n0:29:17\tSPEAKER_02\n You don't need four of those.\n\n0:29:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, for those special colors, you want to choose one remote.\n\n0:29:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:24\tSPEAKER_04\n We have two points spare.\n\n0:29:26\tSPEAKER_04\n So the one point.\n\n0:29:27\tSPEAKER_05\n We have an advanced chip on print.\n\n0:29:31\tSPEAKER_01\n So it would be curved, single curved.\n\n0:29:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Because of...\n\n0:29:35\tSPEAKER_05\n Or not.\n\n0:29:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, well you can at least make it curved again.\n\n0:29:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Very single curved.\n\n0:29:39\tSPEAKER_01\n You can make a nice remote.\n\n0:29:42\tSPEAKER_05\n Because that was very important.\n\n0:29:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Too bad for the speaker.\n\n0:29:44\tSPEAKER_05\n So it's curved, so we dropped the speech recognition.\n\n0:29:48\tSPEAKER_05\n Should we change that speaker?\n\n0:29:49\tSPEAKER_01\n That's a one or not.\n\n0:29:51\tSPEAKER_05\n We dropped the scroll wheel.\n\n0:29:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Could you copy it?\n\n0:29:53\tSPEAKER_01\n And the rest is the same, huh?\n\n0:29:55\tSPEAKER_04\n The scroll wheel is locked.\n\n0:29:59\tSPEAKER_01\n The entire...\n\n0:30:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:30:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Actually, I think copy page of the song.\n\n0:30:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh.\n\n0:30:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, you made the entire...\n\n0:30:20\tSPEAKER_01\n And do...\n\n0:30:21\tSPEAKER_02\n And do...\n\n0:30:22\tSPEAKER_02\n And do.\n\n0:30:24\tSPEAKER_00\n No, not one more time.\n\n0:30:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, let me make it.\n\n0:30:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Two.\n\n0:30:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Perhaps you can say this one.\n\n0:30:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Now copy page.\n\n0:30:34\tSPEAKER_01\n And copy page.\n\n0:30:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Left off.\n\n0:30:39\tSPEAKER_01\n No, but you...\n\n0:30:40\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:41\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:30:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Something I don't know.\n\n0:30:50\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, but this new remote we can't afford.\n\n0:30:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Let's forget.\n\n0:30:56\tSPEAKER_01\n It should have worked.\n\n0:30:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, so you had this list as start?\n\n0:31:00\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:31:01\tSPEAKER_02\n I guess you received it.\n\n0:31:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, okay.\n\n0:31:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:06\tSPEAKER_05\n It works so hard at the final department.\n\n0:31:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, suppose this is...\n\n0:31:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, so we lose the scroll wheel.\n\n0:31:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:16\tSPEAKER_01\n The microphone.\n\n0:31:18\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, and that's it.\n\n0:31:19\tSPEAKER_05\n And the microphone.\n\n0:31:20\tSPEAKER_01\n And we changed something, I guess.\n\n0:31:22\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm not...\n\n0:31:25\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:31:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:31:29\tSPEAKER_05\n That's 12, you have 50.\n\n0:31:31\tSPEAKER_05\n And did you try to make a new design?\n\n0:31:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I tried to copy that one, but it didn't work.\n\n0:31:35\tSPEAKER_01\n It didn't work.\n\n0:31:36\tSPEAKER_01\n So we could fix it like this.\n\n0:31:40\tSPEAKER_01\n You could select it all.\n\n0:31:42\tSPEAKER_01\n That's why you can erase.\n\n0:31:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, you can't erase?\n\n0:31:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Erase.\n\n0:31:47\tSPEAKER_01\n When you...\n\n0:31:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Earlier when we selected it, I don't erase anything.\n\n0:31:54\tSPEAKER_05\n I can't even just say copy.\n\n0:31:57\tSPEAKER_05\n Blink, new page.\n\n0:32:01\tSPEAKER_05\n Based.\n\n0:32:02\tSPEAKER_05\n Ah.\n\n0:32:04\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:07\tSPEAKER_05\n Select none.\n\n0:32:09\tSPEAKER_05\n Just tap somewhere.\n\n0:32:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Just tap somewhere.\n\n0:32:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Just tap somewhere.\n\n0:32:13\tSPEAKER_02\n You're excited.\n\n0:32:14\tSPEAKER_05\n Right.\n\n0:32:15\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:32:16\tSPEAKER_05\n And now you can erase.\n\n0:32:18\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't think I can.\n\n0:32:20\tSPEAKER_01\n I can try.\n\n0:32:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:32:22\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:32:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, no.\n\n0:32:24\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, you can draw off it with white.\n\n0:32:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, we tried it earlier.\n\n0:32:28\tSPEAKER_01\n It's very much work.\n\n0:32:31\tSPEAKER_05\n Sorry.\n\n0:32:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, but that's also useful for the evaluation.\n\n0:32:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Because I think we have a prototype now, which we can afford.\n\n0:32:40\tSPEAKER_05\n And we only need to draw a little bit to get a good design.\n\n0:32:48\tSPEAKER_05\n Doodle.\n\n0:32:49\tSPEAKER_05\n And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation, because of the time.\n\n0:32:54\tSPEAKER_04\n And erase the mic.\n\n0:32:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, goodbye, Mike.\n\n0:32:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I need his no mic.\n\n0:32:59\tSPEAKER_01\n So I erased half of the mic.\n\n0:33:03\tSPEAKER_05\n See this?\n\n0:33:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Push it on.\n\n0:33:07\tSPEAKER_05\n I'll move back to here.\n\n0:33:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Too bad, oh.\n\n0:33:15\tNone\n Blah.\n\n0:33:18\tSPEAKER_04\n Hmm.\n\n0:33:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Like this.\n\n0:33:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Mm-hmm.\n\n0:33:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Still looks nice.\n\n0:33:26\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, great.\n\n0:33:27\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:33:28\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, thank you.\n\n0:33:29\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, looks like iPod.\n\n0:33:30\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, no, Mick.\n\n0:33:32\tSPEAKER_05\n No.\n\n0:33:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Hey, how can you erase that?\n\n0:33:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, this is a bit weird.\n\n0:33:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, it's not really nice.\n\n0:33:38\tSPEAKER_02\n The difference between lines and text and pen.\n\n0:33:41\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, all I need is more mic.\n\n0:33:46\tSPEAKER_05\n You can't erase this.\n\n0:33:49\tSPEAKER_05\n No.\n\n0:33:50\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, let's just leave it at this.\n\n0:33:53\tSPEAKER_05\n And we should be safe.\n\n0:33:56\tSPEAKER_05\n And then we are going to the project or product evaluation.\n\n0:34:00\tSPEAKER_05\n We just did.\n\n0:34:01\tSPEAKER_05\n Now project evaluation.\n\n0:34:03\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, I think I can sit for that.\n\n0:34:06\tSPEAKER_05\n Almost my final slide.\n\n0:34:10\tSPEAKER_05\n What did you think about the process?\n\n0:34:13\tSPEAKER_05\n How satisfied are we?\n\n0:34:16\tSPEAKER_02\n The headlines are sometimes are short.\n\n0:34:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's stressful.\n\n0:34:20\tSPEAKER_04\n I think it should be better if we worked a little bit together.\n\n0:34:27\tSPEAKER_04\n Now we worked through each other.\n\n0:34:29\tSPEAKER_04\n And you could ask him.\n\n0:34:30\tSPEAKER_04\n And you had information I didn't have.\n\n0:34:32\tSPEAKER_04\n And you had information I also had.\n\n0:34:34\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh.\n\n0:34:35\tSPEAKER_04\n Some things I had in my presentation.\n\n0:34:36\tSPEAKER_04\n They already told so.\n\n0:34:37\tSPEAKER_05\n And for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present.\n\n0:34:40\tSPEAKER_05\n What?\n\n0:34:41\tSPEAKER_04\n So yeah, I don't think that is the best way to work.\n\n0:34:44\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, for so you would say communicate during our individual.\n\n0:34:48\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, and maybe a session of five minutes together or something and then work.\n\n0:34:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but why not work here together?\n\n0:34:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:55\tSPEAKER_02\n For example, why should we be separated from each other?\n\n0:34:57\tSPEAKER_02\n And there's different, different rooms.\n\n0:35:00\tSPEAKER_05\n Probably to simulate the whole working process.\n\n0:35:03\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, you can work together too.\n\n0:35:05\tSPEAKER_05\n You can't have a meeting.\n\n0:35:06\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:35:07\tSPEAKER_04\n It's a lot of work.\n\n0:35:08\tSPEAKER_04\n Then you can work together too by mail or by chat.\n\n0:35:11\tSPEAKER_04\n Something.\n\n0:35:12\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, we are completely separated from each other.\n\n0:35:15\tSPEAKER_04\n I don't think that was the best way.\n\n0:35:18\tSPEAKER_02\n But the technology was fantastic.\n\n0:35:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, the technology was really good.\n\n0:35:21\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't really like that board.\n\n0:35:22\tSPEAKER_01\n It doesn't really work.\n\n0:35:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I'll give I don't think that.\n\n0:35:25\tSPEAKER_04\n Sometimes it's a big thing.\n\n0:35:26\tSPEAKER_04\n I think that's what it does work.\n\n0:35:27\tSPEAKER_01\n It does work, but sometimes it doesn't do race or it doesn't.\n\n0:35:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, perhaps it is easy to get one of those digital pens or so and two and lay it next to that keyboard over there.\n\n0:35:36\tSPEAKER_02\n So you can draw it and see it on the screen or something.\n\n0:35:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:40\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:35:42\tSPEAKER_05\n So you don't think the smart board is really useful.\n\n0:35:46\tSPEAKER_01\n But it doesn't really work all the time.\n\n0:35:49\tSPEAKER_02\n So when you put a pen on the screen, for example, the line is being drawn two or three centimeters below.\n\n0:35:56\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, so it's maybe a bit natural.\n\n0:35:58\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, right.\n\n0:35:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, you can point where you want the line to be.\n\n0:36:03\tSPEAKER_01\n But.\n\n0:36:06\tSPEAKER_02\n The project because of the deadlines you didn't have time to have you didn't have time to make a very qualitative presentation.\n\n0:36:21\tSPEAKER_02\n So you used the different PowerPoint presentations in which you put your material on.\n\n0:36:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, that wasn't me.\n\n0:36:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, that wasn't me.\n\n0:36:36\tSPEAKER_05\n So the means we discussed the smart board and what about this digital pen?\n\n0:36:41\tSPEAKER_01\n I didn't use it at all.\n\n0:36:43\tSPEAKER_01\n I used it.\n\n0:36:44\tSPEAKER_01\n So you can use it as a project.\n\n0:36:47\tSPEAKER_05\n I used it as a normal pen and only you used it to get it on the computer.\n\n0:36:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it did work.\n\n0:36:54\tSPEAKER_02\n I used it too.\n\n0:36:56\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't think why you want to use it.\n\n0:36:59\tSPEAKER_01\n But it does work.\n\n0:37:01\tSPEAKER_04\n So make some designs that's very easy to design something and then loyalty to your computer.\n\n0:37:06\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, you can show it to them.\n\n0:37:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's a right idea.\n\n0:37:09\tSPEAKER_01\n It doesn't really matter.\n\n0:37:10\tSPEAKER_02\n But the big to write.\n\n0:37:12\tSPEAKER_02\n It's too big, it's too fat.\n\n0:37:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Fat document does.\n\n0:37:17\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:37:19\tSPEAKER_05\n And what about the teamwork?\n\n0:37:21\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it was great.\n\n0:37:23\tSPEAKER_03\n I think so too.\n\n0:37:24\tSPEAKER_03\n The only thing that we work through post-itual or something, that's the only problem.\n\n0:37:28\tSPEAKER_04\n But it was hard assignment.\n\n0:37:31\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, and maybe I should work out of the room when you discuss this point.\n\n0:37:35\tSPEAKER_01\n I thought it was good.\n\n0:37:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, no problem.\n\n0:37:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Not too much, not too too.\n\n0:37:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:37:44\tSPEAKER_05\n And creativity?\n\n0:37:46\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, when we look at this, I'd say.\n\n0:37:48\tSPEAKER_05\n It's been creative.\n\n0:37:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, the room for...\n\n0:37:51\tSPEAKER_02\n There was the idea to be creative.\n\n0:37:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:58\tSPEAKER_01\n You got some standard ideas in your head.\n\n0:38:00\tSPEAKER_01\n And this is what came out.\n\n0:38:02\tSPEAKER_01\n You get stuff from the...\n\n0:38:04\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:05\tSPEAKER_02\n The information was sometimes...\n\n0:38:08\tSPEAKER_02\n A little bit too late or too late.\n\n0:38:11\tSPEAKER_04\n You just said that for that middle.\n\n0:38:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:15\tSPEAKER_04\n I played, I think, seven times solitary or something.\n\n0:38:18\tSPEAKER_04\n Wow, I didn't know it was time.\n\n0:38:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Is it on there?\n\n0:38:20\tSPEAKER_01\n It's on there.\n\n0:38:21\tSPEAKER_01\n I didn't find that.\n\n0:38:22\tSPEAKER_01\n That's something.\n\n0:38:23\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm so excited.\n\n0:38:24\tSPEAKER_05\n It's like five emails at one moment.\n\n0:38:27\tSPEAKER_04\n No, I never got that.\n\n0:38:28\tSPEAKER_05\n I've never liked one email after 10 minutes or something.\n\n0:38:31\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, I even got spam.\n\n0:38:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Or something like that.\n\n0:38:35\tSPEAKER_04\n That's what we said.\n\n0:38:36\tSPEAKER_04\n And the information was a bit low, I think.\n\n0:38:39\tSPEAKER_04\n In the beginning, I didn't understand what to do.\n\n0:38:42\tSPEAKER_04\n No, the first time.\n\n0:38:44\tSPEAKER_04\n I didn't know.\n\n0:38:45\tSPEAKER_04\n With the remote crew, I definitely knew we had to...\n\n0:38:48\tSPEAKER_04\n We made a remote control.\n\n0:38:50\tSPEAKER_01\n And I didn't know what to do for the first 10 minutes before we got here.\n\n0:38:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:54\tSPEAKER_02\n We were stepping on the table and looking at the internet.\n\n0:38:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Looking at the screen.\n\n0:38:57\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm working on working on one.\n\n0:38:59\tSPEAKER_05\n Rrrrr.\n\n0:39:00\tSPEAKER_05\n Nope.\n\n0:39:02\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, well.\n\n0:39:04\tSPEAKER_05\n But after all we can say, we are satisfied.\n\n0:39:07\tSPEAKER_05\n But it's been better when we get...\n\n0:39:11\tSPEAKER_05\n When we've got more information.\n\n0:39:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, more information about the costs.\n\n0:39:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:39:17\tSPEAKER_01\n That will be handy.\n\n0:39:18\tSPEAKER_02\n First of all, I didn't think that we were able to make an LCD screen...\n\n0:39:22\tSPEAKER_02\n It's first point, but it was possible.\n\n0:39:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:39:26\tSPEAKER_02\n All the controls were used.\n\n0:39:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:39:29\tSPEAKER_01\n So actually you could make an LCD screen, but no mic, or it could make mic, but no, it was this.\n\n0:39:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:39:34\tSPEAKER_05\n A little bit mean to put it in the...\n\n0:39:36\tSPEAKER_05\n And what we had other points to improve this whole process.\n\n0:39:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Rrrrr.\n\n0:39:42\tSPEAKER_03\n I think that's about it.\n\n0:39:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Nothing.\n\n0:39:46\tSPEAKER_03\n I think we got it.\n\n0:39:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Have you...\n\n0:39:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Let's have you let us.\n\n0:39:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, first of all.\n\n0:39:53\tSPEAKER_04\n They were just fine.\n\n0:39:55\tSPEAKER_04\n The network was okay.\n\n0:39:57\tSPEAKER_04\n When you load it was also...\n\n0:39:59\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, everything was there.\n\n0:40:01\tSPEAKER_05\n And some more time might have improved the quantity of work.\n\n0:40:05\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:40:06\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:40:07\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, but now half past four, half past three.\n\n0:40:11\tSPEAKER_01\n And a bit is just the half hours between the two work alone.\n\n0:40:16\tSPEAKER_01\n And that pops up, pops up, pops up, pops up, pops up.\n\n0:40:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, five minutes to the meeting.\n\n0:40:21\tNone\n No.\n\n0:40:30\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, so more time during the individual work phases.\n\n0:40:34\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, well, I just got my warning for the last five minutes.\n\n0:40:39\tSPEAKER_05\n I'll move on to...\n\n0:40:41\tSPEAKER_05\n I guess my last slide.\n\n0:40:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:40:44\tSPEAKER_05\n Which is the closing?\n\n0:40:45\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, we managed
