aan de vervoerde gehoord.\n\n0:00:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Ok\u00c3\u00a9, de bord is kloos.\n\n0:00:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Ok\u00c3\u00a9, laten we beginnen.\n\n0:00:42\tSPEAKER_01\n We hebben al veel tijd als de laatste midden.\n\n0:00:46\tSPEAKER_01\n We hebben het gehoord.\n\n0:00:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Ik ben hier aan de presentatie.\n\n0:00:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Grond.\n\n0:00:52\tSPEAKER_01\n De

controle is een fijn en goed gevoel.\n\n0:02:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Dit is omdat de laatste model was heel verantwoord, maar mensen die niet lieten dat.\n\n0:02:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Dus de nieuwe model moet een goed gevoel zijn dat is iets wat je moet volledig volledig zijn.\n\n0:02:50\tSPEAKER_03\n En de gevoel is ook heel goed.\n\n0:02:53\tSPEAKER_03\n En ook de manier en wat ik heb om te graag te voelen.\n\n0:02:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Er zijn er twee keer in de minuut, want dit is de belangrijkste.\n\n0:03:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Dit is twee keer als het belangrijkste.\n\n0:03:06\tSPEAKER_03\n En het is hetzelfde voor deze.\n\n0:03:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Technologische innovatie is een heel high lead in het gevoel.\n\n0:03:15\tSPEAKER_03\n auch als we staat aansl glitterblinden, we hebben nu een relatie

moeilijkheid.\n\n0:03:50\tSPEAKER_01\n We moeten een van de mensen moeten zijn.\n\n0:03:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Ik denk dat we moeten gaan voor de eerste.\n\n0:03:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Het is het belangrijkste.\n\n0:03:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Dus we moeten een van de mensen moeten zijn.\n\n0:03:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Ok\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n0:03:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Dus het is niet heel belangrijk dat het werkt.\n\n0:04:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Easy.\n\n0:04:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Het moet wel goed zijn.\n\n0:04:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Het kan wel heel moeilijk worden.\n\n0:04:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Ja.\n\n0:04:09\tSPEAKER_01\n We gaan kijken.\n\n0:04:11\tSPEAKER_00\n We zien.\n\n0:04:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Ja, je kan een heel moeilijkheid zijn.\n\n0:04:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Deze is niet heel belangrijk.\n\n0:04:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Het is niet heel belangrijk dat het goed is.\n\n0:04:22\tSPEAKER_03\n En mensen zullen het wel goed zijn.\n\n0:04:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Ok\u00c3\u00a9.\n\n0:04:27\tSPEAKER_03\n

moeilijk.\n\n0:04:33\tSPEAKER_03\n people like dit.\n\n0:04:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Dus we moeten in deze direction denken.\n\n0:04:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Dus het is een zetje.\n\n0:04:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Findings.\n\n0:04:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Fashion update.\n\n0:04:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Fruit and vegetables are cool.\n\n0:04:47\tSPEAKER_03\n I am told.\n\n0:04:50\tSPEAKER_03\n De groepie is heel plezier dat fruit en vegetables zijn.\n\n0:04:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Dus we moeten in dat soort...\n\n0:05:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Ja.\n\n0:05:02\tSPEAKER_03\n way.\n\n0:05:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Verder meer

dat is ook heel belangrijk.\n\n0:05:21\tSPEAKER_01\n VMlegd van deze lengte.\n\n0:05:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Dit jaar is het fur streaming onder.\n\n0:05:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Ja,

goed.\n\n0:05:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Nou, we doen het.\n\n0:05:41\tSPEAKER_03\n All the people like dark colors and simple shapes.\n\n0:05:44\tSPEAKER_03\n We don't want all the people, we want young people.\n\n0:05:47\tSPEAKER_03\n So we're going to turn that around.\n\n0:05:50\tSPEAKER_03\n We're going to have real cool shapes and lots of colors.\n\n0:05:55\tSPEAKER_03\n We don't want wood.\n\n0:05:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Among the old people.\n\n0:06:01\tSPEAKER_03\n So, that's it for me.\n\n0:06:03\tSPEAKER_01\n All right, nice.\n\n0:06:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Show us.\n\n0:06:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Right, I'm going to tell you something about components design.\n\n0:06:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Again, I've put up the specification properties.\n\n0:06:37\tSPEAKER_00\n I've heard several things, so I'll have to change that on the way.\n\n0:06:40\tSPEAKER_00\n But the case, I suggested in the previous meeting, hard plastic.\n\n0:06:45\tSPEAKER_00\n But I should indicate that it should be strong and it should feel strong.\n\n0:06:48\tSPEAKER_00\n So maybe plastic is not sufficient.\n\n0:06:51\tSPEAKER_01\n It is, but it doesn't look strong.\n\n0:06:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, yeah, hard plastic is pretty, pretty tough.\n\n0:06:58\tSPEAKER_00\n But it doesn't have a really, really tough look.\n\n0:07:01\tSPEAKER_01\n But we still have to look at our price, of course.\n\n0:07:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Also, we want an LCD window, etc.\n\n0:07:06\tSPEAKER_00\n But we'll return to that.\n\n0:07:08\tSPEAKER_00\n The buttons, of course, rubber, I think everyone agrees.\n\n0:07:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Electrical cables, copper is all pretty basic stuff.\n\n0:07:14\tSPEAKER_00\n The chip made of silicon, I guess.\n\n0:07:16\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that's the best way to do it.\n\n0:07:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Inferred, let is just a simple bulb.\n\n0:07:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Then I've had a few findings, made a few findings, a target audience product style.\n\n0:07:31\tSPEAKER_00\n It's generally the case that senior and wealthy people, above 45 years old, like, as you said, particularly the traditional materials, such as wood.\n\n0:07:43\tSPEAKER_00\n And materials such as that.\n\n0:07:45\tSPEAKER_00\n They're also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style.\n\n0:07:48\tSPEAKER_00\n But of course, that's not our thing.\n\n0:07:51\tSPEAKER_00\n So this is things we must not do.\n\n0:07:53\tSPEAKER_00\n And then we have young and dynamic people, which is, of course, our group, the people we aim at.\n\n0:08:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Under 45 years old, they like soft materials, with primary colors.\n\n0:08:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Soft materials is, of course, again, a bit of concerted, with our material choice of what you said, that it should be hard and strong looking.\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_00\n But they like soft materials.\n\n0:08:21\tSPEAKER_00\n So we have to consider that.\n\n0:08:23\tSPEAKER_00\n And also they like curved round shapes, so not to do formal like, like the older people want.\n\n0:08:30\tSPEAKER_00\n And if also a finding, but not very applicable here, that sports and gaming devices, such as, the disc mens for joining and those kinds of devices, game devices, should define the characteristics of the device.\n\n0:08:44\tSPEAKER_00\n But since we don't have really a sports or game device, so we don't really have to consider that.\n\n0:08:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Sports, they're, that the eye-catching ones.\n\n0:08:53\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's one on your LCD window.\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_01\n That's nice.\n\n0:08:59\tSPEAKER_00\n I also have results.\n\n0:09:01\tSPEAKER_03\n We keep coming back to the front.\n\n0:09:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Several examples of stads, you can get a clear picture of what I mean.\n\n0:09:11\tSPEAKER_00\n These are the basic, older people stuff.\n\n0:09:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:17\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not very interesting, very classical looking, but that's not what we want.\n\n0:09:22\tSPEAKER_00\n These kinds of things.\n\n0:09:23\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know what exactly they are, they look like.\n\n0:09:26\tSPEAKER_00\n You know you recognize the shapes.\n\n0:09:28\tSPEAKER_00\n It's very primary colors, bright colors, round shapes.\n\n0:09:32\tSPEAKER_00\n You also see this device, very round and fruity.\n\n0:09:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Fruity, of course.\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it's terrible.\n\n0:09:41\tSPEAKER_00\n That's true.\n\n0:09:42\tSPEAKER_00\n And well, round shapes, primary colors, you can see it all here.\n\n0:09:45\tSPEAKER_00\n And of course, this famous device, I guess you know something, something, something, something like this.\n\n0:09:52\tSPEAKER_00\n So to give you an idea of...\n\n0:09:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Strong look, this.\n\n0:09:54\tSPEAKER_00\n This has a strong look, although it's plastic, it's the way to look, to give the iron look.\n\n0:10:00\tSPEAKER_03\n And it's round, but then you're losing your fruity colors.\n\n0:10:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, well, you have to make a...\n\n0:10:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, you can make that middle ring, can you, you can make it on a color.\n\n0:10:08\tSPEAKER_01\n That's true.\n\n0:10:09\tSPEAKER_01\n So, that's kind of the thing.\n\n0:10:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, we can't really make a round, round remote control, I don't think that's very practical.\n\n0:10:15\tSPEAKER_00\n No, it isn't.\n\n0:10:16\tSPEAKER_00\n But it's important to think about the color, because if you make it gray or silvery looking, it does make it a lot more...\n\n0:10:24\tSPEAKER_00\n It does make it looking a lot more stronger.\n\n0:10:27\tSPEAKER_00\n But if you look at this, it doesn't look very, very strong.\n\n0:10:30\tSPEAKER_00\n But this is plastic, and this is...\n\n0:10:32\tSPEAKER_03\n It does have to look strong.\n\n0:10:34\tSPEAKER_03\n The results are, the feel of the material is expected to be strong.\n\n0:10:38\tSPEAKER_03\n The feel.\n\n0:10:39\tSPEAKER_00\n The feel.\n\n0:10:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, if you...\n\n0:10:42\tSPEAKER_02\n It doesn't have to be strong.\n\n0:10:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, the feel.\n\n0:10:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe you should have some colored titanium or something, so it looks fruity, but it feels strong.\n\n0:10:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:10:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Then I have some more findings about the energy source of the device.\n\n0:11:01\tSPEAKER_00\n I suggest the basic battery.\n\n0:11:04\tSPEAKER_00\n I got some other energy sources, of course, but solar energy is not very practical inside the house, because you don't have a lot of sun.\n\n0:11:12\tSPEAKER_00\n And kinetic and dynamics are not very practical, I think, for a simple remote, it's a bit...\n\n0:11:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, that's not...\n\n0:11:20\tSPEAKER_00\n No titanium.\n\n0:11:22\tSPEAKER_00\n That's a bit...\n\n0:11:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Much.\n\n0:11:26\tSPEAKER_00\n And I also suggest that as a shape, a double curved case, the disadvantages of that, that you can use no titanium, that's the information I received.\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_00\n If you use the curved case, a curved case, double curved, then you can't use the titanium.\n\n0:11:43\tSPEAKER_00\n What do you think you need double curved?\n\n0:11:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Now, this, to give them more modern look.\n\n0:11:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Now, the shape, yeah, a curved case.\n\n0:11:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I think it's a sort of triangle shape, the bottom or something.\n\n0:11:57\tSPEAKER_00\n In any case, a more modern look, not plain, a long-box style, but...\n\n0:12:01\tSPEAKER_00\n That will curve.\n\n0:12:02\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:12:03\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll draw it, but maybe later.\n\n0:12:06\tSPEAKER_00\n And it gives it a more uniform shape, and if you have a...\n\n0:12:10\tSPEAKER_00\n But good.\n\n0:12:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Anyway.\n\n0:12:13\tSPEAKER_00\n As for the buttons, simple push buttons, or otherwise, no difficult scroll things, or something, things like that, because it makes more complex and expensive.\n\n0:12:24\tSPEAKER_00\n And as we agreed, we don't use a speaker, or a sensor, or a speech...\n\n0:12:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:12:31\tSPEAKER_00\n...confolder device, and because it makes it also more complex and expensive.\n\n0:12:36\tSPEAKER_00\n But we do use an LCD screen, so...\n\n0:12:38\tSPEAKER_00\n We do have to consider...\n\n0:12:40\tSPEAKER_00\n We have to use a more advanced chip, which is more complex and expensive, but...\n\n0:12:45\tSPEAKER_00\n It's worth the trouble, I think.\n\n0:12:46\tSPEAKER_02\n The book has to be made of a soft material, because people like that.\n\n0:12:51\tSPEAKER_01\n A rubber, it's a soft material, I guess.\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:12:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Soft enough.\n\n0:12:56\tSPEAKER_00\n So that's basically what I'm going to talk about.\n\n0:12:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:12:59\tSPEAKER_01\n We'll take that, and then...\n\n0:13:01\tSPEAKER_01\n...mic.\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:13:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, no, no method.\n\n0:13:26\tSPEAKER_02\n We will include the buttons, as we discussed earlier.\n\n0:13:31\tSPEAKER_02\n And yesterday's screen will be implemented.\n\n0:13:36\tSPEAKER_02\n We must decide where this meeting is.\n\n0:13:39\tSPEAKER_02\n There are new developments in speech recognition systems, and they are already being used on coffee machines.\n\n0:13:49\tSPEAKER_02\n And, well, they're cheap, so we could use them.\n\n0:13:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:54\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:13:55\tSPEAKER_02\n That's interesting.\n\n0:13:56\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not really speech recognition, it's more...\n\n0:13:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Like, you can talk to the chip, record a message, and record an answer, and then once you talk to the remote them, he will answer with the pre-recorded message that you left.\n\n0:14:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, yeah, I'm so happy.\n\n0:14:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Hi, Mike, and you have recorded...\n\n0:14:19\tSPEAKER_02\n...hi, Mike, back.\n\n0:14:21\tSPEAKER_02\n And you'll get there.\n\n0:14:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:14:24\tSPEAKER_01\n But you can also say that when you say something, it does some function.\n\n0:14:27\tSPEAKER_02\n It doesn't do anything.\n\n0:14:30\tSPEAKER_02\n It makes it...\n\n0:14:32\tSPEAKER_03\n It's an extra function.\n\n0:14:34\tSPEAKER_01\n And it does.\n\n0:14:35\tSPEAKER_01\n It has no functionality.\n\n0:14:36\tSPEAKER_01\n No, remote, remote.\n\n0:14:37\tSPEAKER_02\n It has to get you, they won't do it.\n\n0:14:39\tSPEAKER_00\n But it's young people, not bad.\n\n0:14:41\tSPEAKER_02\n It's nice for young people, they like it.\n\n0:14:43\tSPEAKER_02\n You should really include that one, actually.\n\n0:14:45\tSPEAKER_02\n If it's team, yeah.\n\n0:14:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, as I said earlier, I think the LCD screens would be positioned at the lower end of the remote.\n\n0:14:53\tSPEAKER_02\n The buttons for screen width and channel settings, and that's the thing, and that's kind of stuff.\n\n0:14:59\tSPEAKER_02\n We can also do...\n\n0:15:02\tSPEAKER_02\n...let that kind of functions be shown in the LCD screen.\n\n0:15:07\tSPEAKER_02\n So you put the manual...\n\n0:15:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Instead of extra buttons.\n\n0:15:10\tSPEAKER_02\n I think young people, and...\n\n0:15:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, every user would like that.\n\n0:15:17\tSPEAKER_02\n The buttons should be positioned...\n\n0:15:22\tSPEAKER_02\n...positioned the same way as they are on...\n\n0:15:25\tSPEAKER_02\n...well, conventional remotes, I think, for the learnability and...\n\n0:15:30\tSPEAKER_02\n...well, to keep it recognizable.\n\n0:15:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Forage recognition can be implemented.\n\n0:15:37\tSPEAKER_02\n And I do an example, but it did not work quite well.\n\n0:15:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Can you draw it now?\n\n0:15:44\tSPEAKER_02\n I can draw it again, and I know what I did wrong.\n\n0:15:47\tSPEAKER_02\n I didn't take the notebook box.\n\n0:15:50\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:15:51\tSPEAKER_03\n How do you give input to the menu on the LCD screen?\n\n0:15:56\tSPEAKER_02\n With the...\n\n0:15:59\tSPEAKER_02\n...open down and...\n\n0:16:01\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:16:02\tSPEAKER_03\n So you have a menu button, and then you can go over.\n\n0:16:04\tSPEAKER_03\n But I will draw what I...\n\n0:16:06\tSPEAKER_01\n...and also have a screen.\n\n0:16:07\tSPEAKER_01\n And okay button.\n\n0:16:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, right.\n\n0:16:09\tSPEAKER_02\n I should submit the bug.\n\n0:16:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Yep.\n\n0:16:12\tSPEAKER_02\n If it works.\n\n0:16:16\tSPEAKER_01\n There is already a blank, yes?\n\n0:16:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Hmm, so nice.\n\n0:16:23\tNone\n You must have to do it.\n\n0:16:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh no, you have to push hard.\n\n0:16:44\tSPEAKER_00\n I suggest a banana shape.\n\n0:16:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Because of the fruity fashion.\n\n0:16:50\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:16:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Yellow.\n\n0:16:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Next year, that's out.\n\n0:16:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, all right.\n\n0:16:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Just a hunch.\n\n0:16:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, these little buttons are a bit difficult to draw.\n\n0:17:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Those are the channel buttons up.\n\n0:17:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, just the numbers.\n\n0:17:12\tSPEAKER_00\n And then below is the LCD screen.\n\n0:17:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, these will be bigger in the real design.\n\n0:17:22\tSPEAKER_00\n All right.\n\n0:17:23\tSPEAKER_02\n This must be the...\n\n0:17:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, button used to interact with the LCD screen.\n\n0:17:29\tSPEAKER_02\n And with this, you can go through the menus.\n\n0:17:34\tSPEAKER_02\n The video button should be...\n\n0:17:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:17:39\tSPEAKER_02\n You can use it fast within one click.\n\n0:17:44\tSPEAKER_02\n And you need a speaker for this button can also be the menu button.\n\n0:17:51\tSPEAKER_02\n How do you get out of the menu?\n\n0:17:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe you could just press the menu button again.\n\n0:18:00\tSPEAKER_00\n I press the menu button again.\n\n0:18:03\tSPEAKER_00\n It's usual.\n\n0:18:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, because when you push menu, you get in.\n\n0:18:09\tSPEAKER_01\n And then you have to push okay when you get to a choice.\n\n0:18:12\tSPEAKER_00\n But you can press menu again to get out.\n\n0:18:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, that's also the okay button.\n\n0:18:17\tSPEAKER_02\n No, you should have to add an extra menu button.\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Or you can put in the LCD screen, an option, get out.\n\n0:18:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Exit.\n\n0:18:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Once you have an extra menu button, you don't need that extra option.\n\n0:18:33\tSPEAKER_03\n We need a recording button for the speech part.\n\n0:18:38\tSPEAKER_02\n And why would you put that then?\n\n0:18:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Where is the recording the microphone?\n\n0:18:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Where would you put it?\n\n0:18:47\tSPEAKER_02\n That could be anywhere.\n\n0:18:48\tSPEAKER_02\n That's very small.\n\n0:18:49\tSPEAKER_02\n It could be down here.\n\n0:18:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, not here.\n\n0:18:55\tSPEAKER_02\n I suggest here.\n\n0:18:56\tSPEAKER_02\n But that's just a little microphone.\n\n0:18:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Speaker at the back.\n\n0:19:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, the speaker in the microphone, I think, are the same little whole thing.\n\n0:19:08\tSPEAKER_00\n I understand.\n\n0:19:09\tSPEAKER_00\n But we could do, but it's perhaps more expensive.\n\n0:19:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, speaker on the back or something.\n\n0:19:18\tSPEAKER_02\n There are already been implemented in coffee machines, so there won't be very expensive.\n\n0:19:24\tSPEAKER_00\n All right.\n\n0:19:25\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:19:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:19:28\tSPEAKER_02\n This is my suggested.\n\n0:19:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make.\n\n0:19:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, I think, as you can see, so the LCD screen does look better at the lower end.\n\n0:19:42\tSPEAKER_02\n I agree.\n\n0:19:43\tSPEAKER_02\n That's fine.\n\n0:19:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Fine.\n\n0:19:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Move on.\n\n0:19:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:19:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, I have some examples.\n\n0:19:52\tSPEAKER_02\n I can live with it.\n\n0:19:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:19:54\tSPEAKER_02\n But I did not like it very much.\n\n0:20:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, these are too big.\n\n0:20:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Quite obvious, very ugly, or your mouth?\n\n0:20:07\tSPEAKER_00\n They don't look fruity enough.\n\n0:20:09\tSPEAKER_00\n No, they're not red.\n\n0:20:10\tSPEAKER_00\n They're all black.\n\n0:20:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, not all.\n\n0:20:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Hey, that one I like.\n\n0:20:18\tSPEAKER_01\n No, yeah.\n\n0:20:19\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a situation, but it does look strong.\n\n0:20:21\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:20:22\tSPEAKER_00\n But with the colors, it's been the way we're going to.\n\n0:20:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, right.\n\n0:20:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, this is crazy.\n\n0:20:29\tSPEAKER_02\n This is crazy.\n\n0:20:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:31\tSPEAKER_04\n It's too much.\n\n0:20:32\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not really too childish, of course.\n\n0:20:34\tSPEAKER_02\n These are the LCD screens.\n\n0:20:36\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we should, if it's possible, one with colors, but I don't know.\n\n0:20:43\tSPEAKER_02\n It's too expensive.\n\n0:20:44\tSPEAKER_01\n It's too expensive.\n\n0:20:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:46\tNone\n All right.\n\n0:20:47\tSPEAKER_04\n All right.\n\n0:20:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:20:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Ah, even more.\n\n0:20:53\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:20:54\tSPEAKER_01\n But are we going for a strange form?\n\n0:20:59\tSPEAKER_03\n No, it's very strange.\n\n0:21:01\tSPEAKER_03\n It's not too strange.\n\n0:21:02\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not too strange.\n\n0:21:03\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not too strange.\n\n0:21:04\tSPEAKER_03\n You can make it the other side.\n\n0:21:05\tSPEAKER_03\n You can make it more round, where the LCD is.\n\n0:21:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Kind of bridge.\n\n0:21:09\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know if you know the mouse.\n\n0:21:11\tSPEAKER_03\n It's open at the phone.\n\n0:21:12\tSPEAKER_03\n With the round thing at the bottom, something like that.\n\n0:21:17\tSPEAKER_03\n No?\n\n0:21:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I have a home and a remote.\n\n0:21:21\tSPEAKER_01\n If a bridge, it's just a half round, a half circle.\n\n0:21:25\tSPEAKER_01\n And then it falls exactly over the hand.\n\n0:21:28\tSPEAKER_01\n And that's very nice.\n\n0:21:29\tSPEAKER_01\n That feels comfortable.\n\n0:21:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:32\tSPEAKER_03\n But people like something new.\n\n0:21:34\tSPEAKER_00\n It's all taken.\n\n0:21:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:36\tSPEAKER_00\n We're different.\n\n0:21:37\tSPEAKER_00\n I will design it later, so we'll get to that later.\n\n0:21:40\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:21:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Where did I put it?\n\n0:21:43\tSPEAKER_01\n The specific shape.\n\n0:21:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Conceptual face.\n\n0:21:45\tSPEAKER_01\n I think this is it.\n\n0:21:48\tSPEAKER_01\n I got this from our friends.\n\n0:21:52\tSPEAKER_01\n So our sources.\n\n0:21:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, the conceptual design.\n\n0:21:57\tSPEAKER_01\n There's a few examples, which we have to decide about.\n\n0:22:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, the materials from the case.\n\n0:22:04\tSPEAKER_01\n The electric cable.\n\n0:22:06\tSPEAKER_01\n That's all your, your side of the story.\n\n0:22:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Your bag.\n\n0:22:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Now, from the user interface, your package.\n\n0:22:19\tSPEAKER_01\n We're in a world that's more like the buttons where they have to come.\n\n0:22:23\tSPEAKER_01\n And a bit of, yeah, well, a bit of design.\n\n0:22:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, this is what we've just done.\n\n0:22:32\tSPEAKER_02\n But we'll decide about these now.\n\n0:22:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:35\tSPEAKER_01\n And the materials are most.\n\n0:22:36\tSPEAKER_01\n The trend watching.\n\n0:22:37\tSPEAKER_01\n So as you said, fruity is in netwell.\n\n0:22:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Pottery sells good.\n\n0:22:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Wow.\n\n0:22:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, these facts.\n\n0:22:43\tSPEAKER_00\n So we have to put it in one document.\n\n0:22:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:22:47\tSPEAKER_01\n So if we go through that.\n\n0:22:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Copy based this story into a word documented and put the answers after the subjects.\n\n0:22:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Not everything.\n\n0:23:00\tSPEAKER_00\n We have to decide all the things.\n\n0:23:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but all these examples are of a coffee machine.\n\n0:23:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, well.\n\n0:23:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Why should I overwrite them?\n\n0:23:12\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:13\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, a case that's me.\n\n0:23:17\tSPEAKER_00\n I suggest, well, what do I suggest actually?\n\n0:23:20\tSPEAKER_01\n What kind of properties should it have?\n\n0:23:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, which is listened.\n\n0:23:23\tSPEAKER_01\n I think so.\n\n0:23:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Why don't we use titanium or a hard, yeah, some kind of metal for the.\n\n0:23:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you know the new remote?\n\n0:23:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Not except the front that just like a.\n\n0:23:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I understand.\n\n0:23:40\tSPEAKER_00\n All right.\n\n0:23:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:42\tSPEAKER_00\n So we have titanium.\n\n0:23:43\tSPEAKER_00\n The front is the most important.\n\n0:23:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but the non-removable elements of the remote, so not the front, could be titanium to give that a strong look.\n\n0:23:53\tSPEAKER_00\n And then the front is made of plastic.\n\n0:23:55\tSPEAKER_00\n And you can put that on and off and switch it.\n\n0:24:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:01\tSPEAKER_03\n But the field of plastic isn't strong.\n\n0:24:03\tSPEAKER_00\n But you have titanium, of course.\n\n0:24:05\tSPEAKER_00\n So you have the best of both worlds.\n\n0:24:08\tSPEAKER_02\n And you have to remote in your hand like this.\n\n0:24:10\tSPEAKER_02\n So you feel titanium.\n\n0:24:13\tSPEAKER_00\n And of course, yeah, you have the plastic front end.\n\n0:24:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:17\tSPEAKER_03\n You also have the front end.\n\n0:24:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Or cheaper than when you're talking.\n\n0:24:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, of course.\n\n0:24:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, you have to make.\n\n0:24:23\tSPEAKER_02\n And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you wanted to.\n\n0:24:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but it's expected.\n\n0:24:29\tSPEAKER_00\n I guess so.\n\n0:24:30\tSPEAKER_00\n So you can make it in less than one.\n\n0:24:33\tSPEAKER_02\n I think.\n\n0:24:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Bendable.\n\n0:24:35\tSPEAKER_00\n No, the weld.\n\n0:24:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, any color.\n\n0:24:37\tSPEAKER_00\n According to my first, it's totally possible to make an entire...\n\n0:24:42\tSPEAKER_00\n The titanium is available.\n\n0:24:44\tSPEAKER_00\n And we can make an entire remote out of it.\n\n0:24:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, you paint it in the color you want.\n\n0:24:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, the plastic is.\n\n0:24:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Paint the color you want.\n\n0:24:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, right.\n\n0:24:55\tSPEAKER_03\n So we're going for a titanium back and a left front.\n\n0:24:59\tSPEAKER_01\n I think that's a great old front.\n\n0:25:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I'm going to put it in here because we can...\n\n0:25:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, great.\n\n0:25:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Solid fuel and trending.\n\n0:25:13\tSPEAKER_01\n So material.\n\n0:25:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Hard plastic for the front.\n\n0:25:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, for the front and the titanium for the back.\n\n0:25:22\tSPEAKER_00\n For the normal removable part.\n\n0:25:24\tSPEAKER_03\n But then you have the problem.\n\n0:25:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, you have a titanium back.\n\n0:25:27\tSPEAKER_03\n You can't switch it.\n\n0:25:28\tSPEAKER_03\n When you want to add a color on the front, it doesn't match.\n\n0:25:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, but...\n\n0:25:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, titanium is neutral.\n\n0:25:35\tSPEAKER_00\n The titanium isn't very...\n\n0:25:38\tSPEAKER_00\n It doesn't...\n\n0:25:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Curse.\n\n0:25:41\tSPEAKER_00\n No, a...\n\n0:25:43\tSPEAKER_00\n The titanium is very...\n\n0:25:44\tSPEAKER_00\n No, no, no.\n\n0:25:45\tSPEAKER_00\n The titanium is a very basic color.\n\n0:25:47\tSPEAKER_00\n And it doesn't really matter if you have a purple front on it or an orange front.\n\n0:25:50\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know if you disagree, but I think...\n\n0:25:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Our customers...\n\n0:25:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Doesn't matter if it's a funky 20 colors.\n\n0:25:56\tSPEAKER_00\n And even if it doesn't match, people like it.\n\n0:26:00\tSPEAKER_00\n All right.\n\n0:26:01\tSPEAKER_00\n What the...\n\n0:26:02\tSPEAKER_01\n The electric oak cable is just normal.\n\n0:26:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Corp, copper.\n\n0:26:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Beans come...\n\n0:26:08\tSPEAKER_01\n He's been...\n\n0:26:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Someone from the other side of that thing.\n\n0:26:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Excuse me.\n\n0:26:12\tSPEAKER_01\n The electric oak cable...\n\n0:26:15\tSPEAKER_01\n It's copper.\n\n0:26:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Just a bit of coffee.\n\n0:26:17\tSPEAKER_02\n We don't use it in electric oak.\n\n0:26:19\tSPEAKER_02\n No, inside, but this is for a coffee machine.\n\n0:26:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, inside, we're not comfortable with uses.\n\n0:26:24\tSPEAKER_02\n That's not what's meant to you, actually.\n\n0:26:27\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:26:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Or well.\n\n0:26:29\tSPEAKER_03\n So external.\n\n0:26:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, external, well.\n\n0:26:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:33\tSPEAKER_00\n We don't...\n\n0:26:34\tSPEAKER_00\n What a coffee grain doesn't have...\n\n0:26:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Never mind the coffee grain.\n\n0:26:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, all the inside work of our remote is standard work.\n\n0:26:45\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:26:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Right?\n\n0:26:48\tSPEAKER_01\n The chip is normal.\n\n0:26:49\tSPEAKER_01\n The silicon...\n\n0:26:51\tSPEAKER_01\n The buttons are normal.\n\n0:26:52\tSPEAKER_01\n So, let's set it up.\n\n0:26:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:26:55\tSPEAKER_01\n So that's just easy.\n\n0:26:56\tSPEAKER_01\n We decide about that.\n\n0:26:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Just by looking at our competitors and our earlier image.\n\n0:27:02\tSPEAKER_01\n The conceptual specification of the user interface.\n\n0:27:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we have our beautiful drawing.\n\n0:27:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I've got a better one here, and I will...\n\n0:27:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, you can put that into the shared folder,\n\n0:27:16\tSPEAKER_02\n and then I'll put it in our entry port.\n\n0:27:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Our World Word is out. Yes.\n\n0:27:20\tSPEAKER_01\n You can put some...\n\n0:27:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Which button is what?\n\n0:27:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:27:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:27:25\tSPEAKER_01\n The trend watching...\n\n0:27:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Proterie shells.\n\n0:27:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Include these days.\n\n0:27:30\tSPEAKER_01\n And what do we think that fruit and bright colors are...\n\n0:27:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, the four things we can launch a couple of packages.\n\n0:27:39\tSPEAKER_03\n You can buy a different kind of machine, but it's the same thing with another front.\n\n0:27:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:27:48\tSPEAKER_01\n You can also implement...\n\n0:27:50\tSPEAKER_01\n You can also implement fronts from movies that are very hot.\n\n0:27:55\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:27:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Those four later on, the fronts, you can do anything with them.\n\n0:27:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:00\tSPEAKER_03\n But if you launch five different packages, like I put many...\n\n0:28:04\tSPEAKER_02\n For the initiative...\n\n0:28:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:07\tSPEAKER_00\n For the launch.\n\n0:28:08\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a good marketing.\n\n0:28:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Or anything like that.\n\n0:28:12\tSPEAKER_00\n And then a couple of basic colors.\n\n0:28:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Not very...\n\n0:28:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Not too...\n\n0:28:18\tSPEAKER_03\n You can always take another pick.\n\n0:28:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:21\tSPEAKER_01\n We should not give them the most lovely fronts...\n\n0:28:24\tSPEAKER_01\n When they buy it later on.\n\n0:28:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Come on.\n\n0:28:28\tSPEAKER_01\n We still have to make those 50 million.\n\n0:28:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Very boring.\n\n0:28:32\tSPEAKER_01\n The most boring...\n\n0:28:33\tSPEAKER_02\n You can give them a false possible.\n\n0:28:35\tSPEAKER_02\n We also...\n\n0:28:36\tSPEAKER_02\n They can experiment with it.\n\n0:28:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, right.\n\n0:28:39\tSPEAKER_00\n They want more.\n\n0:28:40\tSPEAKER_00\n But you can have some basic colors.\n\n0:28:42\tSPEAKER_00\n And then we come with special patterns on them.\n\n0:28:44\tSPEAKER_02\n And then we can give them a little bit more.\n\n0:28:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah. All right.\n\n0:28:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, the buttons, etc. we get from Mike.\n\n0:28:55\tSPEAKER_01\n This fruit and bright colors.\n\n0:28:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I think we'll have to in the next half an hour.\n\n0:29:02\tSPEAKER_01\n We'll have to specify the different types we want to launch when we...\n\n0:29:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, introduce our remote.\n\n0:29:13\tSPEAKER_00\n We still have to make the real basic design.\n\n0:29:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Because we have the...\n\n0:29:17\tSPEAKER_03\n But we have to catch them.\n\n0:29:18\tSPEAKER_03\n We must remember that fancy look and feel is the most important thing.\n\n0:29:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:29:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Also it won't sell.\n\n0:29:23\tSPEAKER_03\n So...\n\n0:29:24\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:29:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I'll have to pick four.\n\n0:29:27\tSPEAKER_01\n I get another warning from five minutes.\n\n0:29:30\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm going to get...\n\n0:29:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Where is my mouse?\n\n0:29:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Where is my mouse?\n\n0:29:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Where is my mouse?\n\n0:29:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Last my mouse.\n\n0:29:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:29:39\tSPEAKER_01\n This is it.\n\n0:29:42\tNone\n Thanks.\n\n0:29:43\tNone\n I believe you're open.\n\n0:29:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, this we have...\n\n0:29:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Basic stuff.\n\n0:29:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Interface we have.\n\n0:29:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Supplements LCD.\n\n0:30:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe a cheap voice recording.\n\n0:30:04\tNone\n Well, the pie.\n\n0:30:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes. All right.\n\n0:30:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Individual actions.\n\n0:30:08\tSPEAKER_01\n We all agree on that.\n\n0:30:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Industry designer ties.\n\n0:30:12\tSPEAKER_01\n User interface, Mike.\n\n0:30:14\tSPEAKER_01\n You're going to work together.\n\n0:30:16\tSPEAKER_01\n On a prototype drawing.\n\n0:30:18\tSPEAKER_01\n On the smart board.\n\n0:30:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, we can do that.\n\n0:30:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Together or...\n\n0:30:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, together.\n\n0:30:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:30:24\tSPEAKER_02\n That's what I got to hear.\n\n0:30:26\tSPEAKER_01\n We should hear or something.\n\n0:30:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we'll get it to hear that.\n\n0:30:30\tSPEAKER_01\n I think, but I think so.\n\n0:30:31\tSPEAKER_01\n There's a smart board.\n\n0:30:32\tSPEAKER_01\n You can take the smart board.\n\n0:30:33\tSPEAKER_01\n This is the smart board.\n\n0:30:34\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:30:35\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm taking it to our rooms.\n\n0:30:37\tSPEAKER_01\n So you're going to make a prototype.\n\n0:30:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, that includes specifying the buttons.\n\n0:30:44\tSPEAKER_01\n We'll see if we can do that.\n\n0:30:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:47\tSPEAKER_01\n So you'll get it on your laptop.\n\n0:30:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, you will go and do something else.\n\n0:30:52\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm so...\n\n0:30:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Project evaluation.\n\n0:30:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:31:01\tSPEAKER_01\n What are you going to do?\n\n0:31:03\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know what product evaluation exactly means.\n\n0:31:06\tSPEAKER_01\n But you'll get the specifications.\n\n0:31:08\tSPEAKER_03\n We don't have product yet.\n\n0:31:10\tSPEAKER_03\n So...\n\n0:31:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that's why I...\n\n0:31:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Kind of difficult.\n\n0:31:13\tSPEAKER_01\n But you're fired.\n\n0:31:15\tSPEAKER_01\n No, why?\n\n0:31:16\tSPEAKER_01\n How long do we still have?\n\n0:31:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, can we talk about something else?\n\n0:31:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, so...\n\n0:31:22\tSPEAKER_00\n No, I don't know anything, but...\n\n0:31:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Who's the idea?\n\n0:31:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, anyway...\n\n0:31:25\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know.\n\n0:31:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Will we use round buttons or square ones for the...\n\n0:31:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Round, I think, rounds.\n\n0:31:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n0:31:32\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:31:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Do make it as round as possible.\n\n0:31:35\tSPEAKER_02\n These...\n\n0:31:36\tSPEAKER_02\n These...\n\n0:31:37\tSPEAKER_02\n These buttons?\n\n0:31:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Why not?\n\n0:31:39\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm more...\n\n0:31:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Trial field.\n\n0:31:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:42\tSPEAKER_02\n So you can see you have to...\n\n0:31:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:45\tSPEAKER_03\n But for down.\n\n0:31:46\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:47\tSPEAKER_00\n But now I see the...\n\n0:31:48\tSPEAKER_03\n This must be...\n\n0:31:49\tSPEAKER_03\n For you, I think.\n\n0:31:50\tSPEAKER_03\n And this program.\n\n0:31:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Hmm...\n\n0:31:56\tSPEAKER_02\n We can't...\n\n0:31:57\tSPEAKER_02\n We can't...\n\n0:31:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Up and down is program.\n\n0:32:00\tSPEAKER_02\n And left and right are...\n\n0:32:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, that...\n\n0:32:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Depends on...\n\n0:32:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Depends on...\n\n0:32:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, we...\n\n0:32:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Just turn up the volume.\n\n0:32:10\tSPEAKER_02\n We'll see the...\n\n0:32:11\tSPEAKER_00\n We'll just give them a...\n\n0:32:13\tSPEAKER_00\n We'll design it and let it give comments on it.\n\n0:32:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:32:16\tSPEAKER_01\n It doesn't work anymore.\n\n0:32:18\tSPEAKER_01\n We can save them, so...\n\n0:32:19\tSPEAKER_01\n We'll just have them...\n\n0:32:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Stay in there.\n\n0:32:22\tSPEAKER_03\n You can...\n\n0:32:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Click the corner.\n\n0:32:24\tSPEAKER_03\n No!\n\n0:32:25\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a bit...\n\n0:32:27\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a bit...\n\n0:32:28\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a bit...\n\n0:32:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we still have more than five minutes.\n\n0:32:32\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:32:35\tSPEAKER_01\n What are we going to do?\n\n0:32:37\tSPEAKER_01\n I, as Greg mentioned, don't have a clue.\n\n0:32:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Let's start the design.\n\n0:32:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, we can...\n\n0:32:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Decide how we implement the feeling from our company...\n\n0:32:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Into the remote.\n\n0:32:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, yeah.\n\n0:32:51\tSPEAKER_00\n I think...\n\n0:32:52\tSPEAKER_00\n A logo, our company logo, and the slogan...\n\n0:32:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Also the slogan...\n\n0:32:56\tSPEAKER_00\n On the...\n\n0:32:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, why not?\n\n0:32:58\tSPEAKER_00\n If there's no space, then you can put the wheel...\n\n0:33:00\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll say only the logo.\n\n0:33:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, me too.\n\n0:33:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Too much text and...\n\n0:33:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, our slogan is not very long, right?\n\n0:33:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Just a simple...\n\n0:33:08\tSPEAKER_02\n What is the fashion in electronics?\n\n0:33:10\tSPEAKER_01\n We put the fashion in electronics.\n\n0:33:12\tSPEAKER_03\n We keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts.\n\n0:33:17\tSPEAKER_03\n So...\n\n0:33:18\tSPEAKER_00\n But you can put it on the back, on the titanium part.\n\n0:33:21\tSPEAKER_00\n The logo and the...\n\n0:33:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, and the logo should be...\n\n0:33:24\tSPEAKER_02\n The logo, I think.\n\n0:33:26\tSPEAKER_02\n On the top.\n\n0:33:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:28\tSPEAKER_01\n And the right top corner.\n\n0:33:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Right corner, yes.\n\n0:33:31\tSPEAKER_01\n And, well, you can put it in the back.\n\n0:33:32\tSPEAKER_00\n You can put...\n\n0:33:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe here in the middle.\n\n0:33:34\tSPEAKER_01\n At the bottom, you can put the logo...\n\n0:33:37\tSPEAKER_01\n With that.\n\n0:33:38\tSPEAKER_01\n With the text.\n\n0:33:40\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:41\tSPEAKER_03\n The logo shouldn't be exchangeable when you...\n\n0:33:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it should be hard on the board.\n\n0:33:46\tSPEAKER_00\n And you can...\n\n0:33:47\tSPEAKER_02\n The logo can be on every...\n\n0:33:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but you can scratch it over something.\n\n0:33:52\tSPEAKER_03\n It's better if you have it...\n\n0:33:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but then you must really...\n\n0:33:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Carved into the material.\n\n0:33:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Push it in or something.\n\n0:33:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Now, you can carve it into the titanium at the back.\n\n0:34:02\tSPEAKER_00\n I like the idea of the slogan on the...\n\n0:34:05\tSPEAKER_00\n On the thing, but...\n\n0:34:06\tSPEAKER_00\n An idea on the one or...\n\n0:34:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, management, I like it.\n\n0:34:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Not on the...\n\n0:34:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Front side, I think.\n\n0:34:11\tSPEAKER_02\n The front side?\n\n0:34:12\tSPEAKER_02\n No, not on the back side.\n\n0:34:13\tSPEAKER_02\n But on the back side.\n\n0:34:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, you can push it in.\n\n0:34:16\tSPEAKER_02\n So that is...\n\n0:34:17\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's a nice idea to make it more recognizable.\n\n0:34:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Next to the logo, you have the slogan.\n\n0:34:24\tSPEAKER_00\n I agree.\n\n0:34:25\tSPEAKER_00\n But not too big.\n\n0:34:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Not too big, no, very small.\n\n0:34:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Not the entire back, but just very small.\n\n0:34:32\tSPEAKER_00\n But readable, not of course.\n\n0:34:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:34:36\tSPEAKER_00\n But we'll...\n\n0:34:37\tSPEAKER_00\n We'll take that with us and then to design.\n\n0:34:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Over here, the logo.\n\n0:34:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Or maybe here in the middle.\n\n0:34:44\tSPEAKER_00\n What we'll design later.\n\n0:34:45\tSPEAKER_01\n With logo.\n\n0:34:47\tSPEAKER_01\n And...\n\n0:34:48\tSPEAKER_01\n logo.\n\n0:34:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Also...\n\n0:34:52\tSPEAKER_01\n The front, but not X.\n\n0:34:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Change.\n\n0:34:59\tSPEAKER_01\n So good.\n\n0:35:07\tSPEAKER_01\n When changing...\n\n0:35:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Front.\n\n0:35:15\tNone\n All right.\n\n0:35:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Do you see a bit of...\n\n0:35:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Do you see a bit of...\n\n0:35:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Of the...\n\n0:35:20\tSPEAKER_01\n 5 minutes left.\n\n0:35:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Of the titanium on the front.\n\n0:35:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe if we make this lower part, the front is the upper part and the bit with LCD screen.\n\n0:35:33\tSPEAKER_01\n So a bit of titanium between.\n\n0:35:36\tSPEAKER_00\n No, now between.\n\n0:35:38\tSPEAKER_00\n That's pretty cool.\n\n0:35:39\tSPEAKER_00\n But then you have two parts of the...\n\n0:35:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Two parts of the...\n\n0:35:42\tSPEAKER_00\n You make this titanium too.\n\n0:35:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:44\tSPEAKER_03\n This entire problem with the LCD.\n\n0:35:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:35:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Like dust in it and things like that.\n\n0:35:49\tSPEAKER_03\n When you exchange all the fronts and it's...\n\n0:35:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:35:52\tSPEAKER_01\n I already have all kinds of...\n\n0:35:54\tSPEAKER_01\n And then not straight line with the...\n\n0:35:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Mobile.\n\n0:35:57\tSPEAKER_02\n And then the lower part of the titanium.\n\n0:36:00\tSPEAKER_02\n This is titanium.\n\n0:36:01\tSPEAKER_02\n I think that's nice.\n\n0:36:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Some kind of way...\n\n0:36:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Round forms.\n\n0:36:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:08\tSPEAKER_00\n I liked it a bit of a titanium also.\n\n0:36:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:11\tSPEAKER_00\n On the...\n\n0:36:12\tSPEAKER_00\n A bit like your...\n\n0:36:13\tSPEAKER_00\n A bit like your mobile phone.\n\n0:36:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe you can show it to...\n\n0:36:15\tSPEAKER_00\n It also has the...\n\n0:36:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Doge.\n\n0:36:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Just think...\n\n0:36:21\tSPEAKER_00\n A bit like this.\n\n0:36:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:23\tSPEAKER_03\n You can make it...\n\n0:36:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Go around this corner too, where the logo is.\n\n0:36:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Because it has to be...\n\n0:36:30\tSPEAKER_03\n There all the time.\n\n0:36:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:36:32\tSPEAKER_00\n That...\n\n0:36:33\tSPEAKER_00\n So maybe a nice touch, yeah.\n\n0:36:34\tSPEAKER_00\n A little corner of titanium.\n\n0:36:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:36:37\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a nice touch, you need.\n\n0:36:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it's all the sounds pretty, yeah.\n\n0:36:41\tSPEAKER_01\n So this...\n\n0:36:42\tSPEAKER_00\n I think I go on to buy a...\n\n0:36:43\tSPEAKER_00\n A stationable part.\n\n0:36:44\tSPEAKER_01\n We want this.\n\n0:36:45\tSPEAKER_01\n And it's only 25 euros.\n\n0:36:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Come on.\n\n0:36:48\tSPEAKER_01\n No, there's nothing.\n\n0:36:50\tSPEAKER_00\n No, no, no, but...\n\n0:36:51\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's...\n\n0:36:52\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's...\n\n0:36:53\tSPEAKER_00\n It looks pretty nice.\n\n0:36:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Of course.\n\n0:36:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Of course it's my design.\n\n0:36:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Our design.\n\n0:36:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Take all the credit.\n\n0:37:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, the two are going together.\n\n0:37:01\tSPEAKER_01\n You'll get your specifications on your laptop and then...\n\n0:37:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, we'll stay here, I guess.\n\n0:37:06\tSPEAKER_03\n But there's a problem.\n\n0:37:07\tSPEAKER_03\n We can take a blank one.\n\n0:37:09\tSPEAKER_03\n What can we?\n\n0:37:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I think we can...\n\n0:37:11\tSPEAKER_01\n I just threw it in...\n\n0:37:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we can...\n\n0:37:13\tSPEAKER_02\n I guess, a raised animal, I guess.\n\n0:37:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n0:37:16\tSPEAKER_00\n But don't erase my cat.\n\n0:37:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Or fourth one is empty.\n\n0:37:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh!\n\n0:37:22\tSPEAKER_00\n I want to preserve it.\n\n0:37:24\tNone\n Hey.\n\n0:37:25\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, that's...\n\n0:37:26\tSPEAKER_03\n This one is empty.\n\n0:37:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, it's empty one now.\n\n0:37:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, we have a pre-empty one.\n\n0:37:32\tSPEAKER_00\n What are you doing, Chief?\n\n0:37:34\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:37:36\tSPEAKER_01\n You can draw.\n\n0:37:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I think we have to wait.\n\n0:37:40\tSPEAKER_02\n No, I'll get the...\n\n0:37:41\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll get the...\n\n0:37:42\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't...\n\n0:37:43\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't...\n\n0:37:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Do we have to stay here?\n\n0:37:45\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we have to wait.\n\n0:37:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n0:37:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, maybe you can keep your laptop here.\n\n0:37:50\tSPEAKER_01\n So, maybe...\n\n0:37:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Or get your mouse, because it's...\n\n0:37:54\tSPEAKER_01\n The high power from a ball.\n\n0:37:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Hard to work with these plates.\n\n0:37:57\tSPEAKER_03\n We'll have to do that.\n\n0:37:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:59\tSPEAKER_03\n It's not relaxing.\n\n0:38:00\tSPEAKER_01\n I always have a mouse next to my laptop.\n\n0:38:03\tSPEAKER_01\n I hate these.\n\n0:38:04\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't have to have a laptop.\n\n0:38:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, touchpad, yeah.\n\n0:38:06\tSPEAKER_00\n We can do a touchpad on our remote.\n\n0:38:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, right.\n\n0:38:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Just kidding.\n\n0:38:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Now, we have to have a bit of humor in the...\n\n0:38:15\tSPEAKER_00\n In the discussion, too.\n\n0:38:17\tSPEAKER_00\n And then your remote control...\n\n0:38:19\tSPEAKER_01\n So, we push a touchpad on it and say, Ha-ha.\n\n0:38:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, this is no furniture.\n\n0:38:24\tSPEAKER_01\n We know you hate it, but...\n\n0:38:28\tSPEAKER_00\n But the youth doesn't care about functionality.\n\n0:38:31\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:38:32\tSPEAKER_01\n But they do want some gadgets.\n\n0:38:34\tSPEAKER_01\n It's all about goofing.\n\n0:38:35\tSPEAKER_01\n What are we doing?\n\n0:38:37\tSPEAKER_03\n And it will sell.\n\n0:38:39\tSPEAKER_03\n We will be rich.\n\n0:38:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Bless you.\n\n0:38:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we will...\n\n0:38:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Our bosses will be rich.\n\n0:38:46\tSPEAKER_02\n We've done too much in the previous meetings.\n\n0:38:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Too much?\n\n0:38:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:38:51\tSPEAKER_02\n We've got nothing to do now.\n\n0:38:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, that's not bad, isn't it?\n\n0:38:55\tSPEAKER_03\n No.\n\n0:38:56\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that's good.\n\n0:38:57\tSPEAKER_00\n We all had our talk and...\n\n0:39:00\tSPEAKER_00\n We agree, I guess, on...\n\n0:39:02\tSPEAKER_00\n On everything.\n\n0:39:03\tSPEAKER_00\n On most and on things.\n\n0:39:05\tSPEAKER_02\n It's the best remote in there.\n\n0:39:12\tSPEAKER_01\n So.\n\n0:39:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, he's totally off again.\n\n0:39:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Well.\n\n0:39:26\tSPEAKER_03\n No, man.\n\n0:39:28\tSPEAKER_03\n You just have to push harder.\n\n0:39:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, you have to push harder.\n\n0:39:33\tSPEAKER_01\n But when I start here...\n\n0:39:36\tSPEAKER_01\n It's here.\n\n0:39:38\tSPEAKER_02\n You get really close to the screen with your hand.\n\n0:39:42\tSPEAKER_02\n And I don't think this.\n\n0:39:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Re-calibrate it.\n\n0:39:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Where's the good old chalkboard with...\n\n0:39:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:40:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Greenboard with... how do you call it chalk?\n\n0:40:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:40:09\tSPEAKER_02\n You can better draw a design on this.\n\n0:40:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, maybe.\n\n0:40:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but we can't.\n\n0:40:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe if that thing is re-calibrated, we can draw it thin quick.\n\n0:40:19\tSPEAKER_00\n And before it...\n\n0:40:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:40:23\tSPEAKER_00\n It goes again.\n\n0:40:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, it's finished meeting now.\n\n0:40:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Finished the meeting now.\n\n0:40:28\tSPEAKER_01\n All right, now we know what to do, shall we?\n\n0:40:30\tSPEAKER_01\n We'll stay here.\n\n0:40:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Um...\n\n0:40:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:40:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, we'll get to...\n\n0:40:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe you know.\n\n0:40:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Get away.\n\n0:40:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Can we get meal here?\n\n0:40:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:40:45\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm not sure.\n\n0:40:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe, yeah.\n\n0:40:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, you have to work on it.\n\n0:40:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, I'm a few seconds.\n\n0:40:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:40:51\tSPEAKER_01\n That's a good idea.\n\n0:40:52\tSPEAKER_03\n All right.\n\n0:40:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Have fun, lads.\n\n0:40:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Happy holidays.\n\n0:40:59\tNone\n Don't do too little.\n\n0:41:01\tNone\n Oh, man.\n\n0:41:02\tNone\n Make us a nice design.\n\n0:41:03\tNone\n Going to relax.\n\n0:41:08\tNone\n I think we have to design here.\n\n0:41:10\tNone\n Well, maybe this room is only for discussions.\n\n0:41:13\tNone\n But how can we go up already, for me?\n\n0:41:21\tNone\n Well, it's a little off again.\n\n0:41:23\tNone\n And also do we have to...\n\n0:41:26\tNone\n either industry designer and...\n\n0:41:29\tNone\n We have to design now together the...\n\n0:41:32\tNone\n Yeah, here.\n\n0:41:33\tNone\n All right.\n\n0:41:34\tNone\n And you would be alive, eh?\n\n0:41:35\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:41:36\tNone\n Talking with you.\n\n0:41:37\tNone\n Yeah, they stay here and work here.\n\n0:41:39\tNone\n You're just staying here.\n\n0:41:40\tNone\n All right.\n\n0:41:41\tNone\n Exactly.\n\n0:41:42\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:41:43\tNone\n Get out of here.\n\n0:41:44\tNone\n Good luck.\n\n0:41:45\tNone\n All right.\n\n0:41:46\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:41:47\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:41:48\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:41:49\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:41:50\tNone\n All right.\n\n0:41:51\tNone\n You draw the main design show.\n\n0:41:54\tNone\n I'm the better artist.\n\n0:41:55\tNone\n It's...\n\n0:41:56\tNone\n That's true.\n\n0:41:57\tNone\n Wap.\n\n0:41:58\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:41:59\tNone\n Of course.\n\n0:42:00\tNone\n I really like this.\n\n0:42:01\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:02\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:03\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:04\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:05\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:06\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:07\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:08\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:09\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:10\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:11\tNone\n

Yeah.\n\n0:42:20\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:21\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:22\tNone\n I think we have to put somewhere else over there, there away, so we can...\n\n0:42:32\tNone\n The sightings for ourselves.\n\n0:42:34\tNone\n Mike and Thais and Cole.\n\n0:42:37\tNone\n And company.\n\n0:42:39\tNone\n Get into your room.\n\n0:42:40\tNone\n We got three of you.\n\n0:42:41\tNone\n We got three of you.\n\n0:42:42\tNone\n Can you come over to the next floor?\n\n0:42:43\tNone\n No.\n\n0:42:44\tNone\n It's your work now.\n\n0:42:51\tNone\n All right.\n\n0:42:52\tNone\n All
