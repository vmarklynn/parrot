M maybe we could make a clap system.\n\n0:06:49\tSPEAKER_04\n So when you clap your hands it will beep, or something.\n\n0:06:53\tSPEAKER_04\n You must find it quickly.\n\n0:06:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe just a button on the home station.\n\n0:06:58\tSPEAKER_01\n So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station.\n\n0:07:02\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:07:03\tSPEAKER_04\n And we can combine that.\n\n0:07:05\tSPEAKER_04\n It takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control.\n\n0:07:10\tSPEAKER_04\n I think we must take a look at this.\n\n0:07:14\tSPEAKER_04\n It's only 34% because if we make a world new product our own style, this is so difficult.\n\n0:07:30\tSPEAKER_04\n Next, remote control is also bad for AirZ.\n\n0:07:34\tSPEAKER_04\n But only if they accept a lot and they watch over 5 hours TV or something.\n\n0:07:40\tSPEAKER_04\n \u00e2\u0080\u00a6aah, we haven't, we mustn't look too much at the last point.\n\n0:07:45\tSPEAKER_04\n OK, last page.\n\n0:07:48\tSPEAKER_04\n The last experiment was about gadgets, like speech recognition.\n\n0:07:54\tSPEAKER_04\n We didn't think about that already.\n\n0:07:57\tSPEAKER_04\n And an LCD on the remote control.\n\n0:08:00\tSPEAKER_04\n We already talked about that.\n\n0:08:04\tSPEAKER_04\n And they finally had a conclusion that younger people, under an age of 45, are more interested in new features.\n\n0:08:14\tSPEAKER_04\n But they are more critical.\n\n0:08:16\tSPEAKER_04\n And older people want to spend more money.\n\n0:08:19\tSPEAKER_04\n But they don't want to have a lot of new features, because they are in their old thinking way.\n\n0:08:27\tSPEAKER_04\n And they want to keep the old things, the old things.\n\n0:08:30\tSPEAKER_03\n So we have a new age for 4-bit.\n\n0:08:34\tSPEAKER_04\n But you already said that the company was about 40 plus clients.\n\n0:08:39\tSPEAKER_03\n So we just can skip the LCD on the remote control.\n\n0:08:42\tSPEAKER_04\n I think we can skip speech recognition directly, because it's not reachable for 25 euros.\n\n0:08:51\tSPEAKER_04\n And then I have my personal preference.\n\n0:08:58\tSPEAKER_04\n OK, that's not very good, because I thought about the television DVD plays the area, and Fiji are the question about.\n\n0:09:04\tSPEAKER_04\n But it's already out of the question.\n\n0:09:08\tSPEAKER_04\n My point is, well, if we make remote control for only television, I think it's hard to sell it for 25 euros, but it's the exercise.\n\n0:09:20\tSPEAKER_03\n It's too expensive.\n\n0:09:21\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, only for television.\n\n0:09:24\tSPEAKER_04\n On the market you can now buy for 20 euros a remote control for everything.\n\n0:09:28\tSPEAKER_04\n And we only make it for television, so we must make it very special.\n\n0:09:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, good usability, so you can use it.\n\n0:09:36\tSPEAKER_04\n OK, I talked about the home station.\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_04\n It must be simple, because the elderly people need to use it.\n\n0:09:44\tSPEAKER_04\n And I found the motto, and we put the fashion in electronics.\n\n0:09:49\tSPEAKER_04\n And that's the motto we are referenced for our style.\n\n0:09:56\tSPEAKER_04\n We have to make a new product.\n\n0:09:59\tSPEAKER_04\n We have to be...\n\n0:10:02\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:04\tSPEAKER_04\n Wonderful kind.\n\n0:10:06\tSPEAKER_03\n So it has to look...\n\n0:10:08\tSPEAKER_04\n The company is about their own fashion, their own style.\n\n0:10:12\tSPEAKER_03\n But old people are not looking for that.\n\n0:10:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, I think...\n\n0:10:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Not really.\n\n0:10:18\tSPEAKER_02\n I think the main thing is usability.\n\n0:10:20\tSPEAKER_02\n That's when we can make a special product.\n\n0:10:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Keep it simple, we also have to stand out, because there are already, like you said, so many controls out that support a lot of stuff.\n\n0:10:33\tSPEAKER_01\n But we have to make sure that we're better in usability and stand out by just looks at it.\n\n0:10:38\tSPEAKER_01\n So make it just a different color or different shape.\n\n0:10:41\tSPEAKER_01\n OK.\n\n0:10:42\tSPEAKER_04\n OK, this was my presentation.\n\n0:10:45\tSPEAKER_04\n OK.\n\n0:10:48\tSPEAKER_04\n I don't know.\n\n0:10:49\tSPEAKER_03\n So Paul, you can do the right one first.\n\n0:10:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:54\tSPEAKER_03\n It's on the net.\n\n0:10:57\tSPEAKER_03\n There is.\n\n0:11:05\tSPEAKER_01\n OK.\n\n0:11:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Technical functions design.\n\n0:11:09\tSPEAKER_01\n OK, well, we have a broad audience.\n\n0:11:13\tSPEAKER_01\n That isn't true anymore, but we have elderly people, so we need to keep it simple.\n\n0:11:19\tSPEAKER_01\n The way I want to keep it simple is to use the standards.\n\n0:11:24\tSPEAKER_01\n So the standardized methods, like on all remote controls.\n\n0:11:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Not to fool, like Jens already said, only 10% is being used.\n\n0:11:36\tSPEAKER_03\n So what do you think of only the numbers and the off button?\n\n0:11:40\tSPEAKER_01\n We have to do the next page, but yes, basic functions, like numbers and that sort of stuff.\n\n0:11:47\tSPEAKER_01\n So the option is that we put on there should be eased used, because you have more room than, and for elderly people, big buttons, an icon on it or a text on it, so it's very clear what that button does.\n\n0:12:03\tSPEAKER_01\n So it doesn't take much time to figure out how to use it.\n\n0:12:08\tSPEAKER_01\n A way to find out what people use.\n\n0:12:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe just use questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people, elderly people.\n\n0:12:19\tSPEAKER_01\n What they use, what they want on remote control to find out.\n\n0:12:25\tSPEAKER_01\n But there was already one done.\n\n0:12:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, functions I could think of volume channels.\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_01\n The basic I call it numpad.\n\n0:12:36\tSPEAKER_01\n So I call it a text service option.\n\n0:12:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Basic on off.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_01\n And I found it, could I think of favorites?\n\n0:12:47\tSPEAKER_01\n I always look up the same pages on text and I always have to click the number.\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_01\n What if you could make a new option that you just have to press one button and you get on your...\n\n0:12:59\tSPEAKER_02\n So remember what favorite is what channel, so you might as well remember the number.\n\n0:13:07\tSPEAKER_03\n No, maybe it's too complicated, I'm not sure.\n\n0:13:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, it's a good idea.\n\n0:13:12\tSPEAKER_01\n It was just a thought, so I would find it handy, I think, when you just press one button and you get on 666.\n\n0:13:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, okay, but how can you remember what channel connects to what favorite button?\n\n0:13:27\tSPEAKER_01\n I was reading on the page, I'm writing a full just since command, basic commands to the television.\n\n0:13:35\tSPEAKER_01\n So switch to channel 6.\n\n0:13:38\tSPEAKER_01\n So a button 6 says 6.\n\n0:13:41\tSPEAKER_01\n And if you make favorites, it can say 666 in a row.\n\n0:13:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Just numbers.\n\n0:13:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, okay, but for a user to remember, if I press that button, it goes to that channel.\n\n0:13:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, if you set a favorite.\n\n0:13:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but isn't it hard to remember?\n\n0:13:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Like favorite one.\n\n0:13:59\tSPEAKER_03\n For me, if I use my telephone, I never use those buttons to question.\n\n0:14:05\tSPEAKER_03\n No, neither do I.\n\n0:14:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, now maybe not.\n\n0:14:09\tSPEAKER_03\n If I don't do it, maybe old people.\n\n0:14:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe old people.\n\n0:14:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, they don't like new features, so maybe not.\n\n0:14:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, play pause.\n\n0:14:21\tSPEAKER_01\n And I know that it's useful.\n\n0:14:24\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not anymore for TV.\n\n0:14:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Right, I don't know.\n\n0:14:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Did I miss any other buttons, basic buttons?\n\n0:14:33\tSPEAKER_01\n I couldn't think of any other, especially not for TV.\n\n0:14:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Just on the front as well.\n\n0:14:38\tSPEAKER_03\n No, that's only the only thing you need.\n\n0:14:40\tSPEAKER_02\n The next and previous, previous I know, but next channel.\n\n0:14:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Just a channel, what I mean is that.\n\n0:14:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Like a web browser.\n\n0:14:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:14:51\tSPEAKER_02\n But there's also a button to go to the channel you've been before.\n\n0:14:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Like a web browser.\n\n0:15:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Back button.\n\n0:15:01\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't have.\n\n0:15:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I know what it is, but I think it's all the difficulties.\n\n0:15:05\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:15:06\tSPEAKER_01\n You used that when you want to go to.\n\n0:15:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, just use when you want to switch between channels all the time.\n\n0:15:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, we want to do it like if you have a channel above 10.\n\n0:15:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Normally you can press one.\n\n0:15:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I think, especially for older people, you use standard buttons.\n\n0:15:25\tSPEAKER_01\n So you have that.\n\n0:15:27\tSPEAKER_01\n The 10 plus button.\n\n0:15:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, the 10 plus button.\n\n0:15:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Just one one pressing or quickly after each other.\n\n0:15:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:15:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Just to keep it simple and standard features.\n\n0:15:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, wouldn't it be a problem to, because you have to be fast enough.\n\n0:15:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe the elderly people.\n\n0:15:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:15:45\tSPEAKER_01\n But I think that's in the TV as well.\n\n0:15:49\tSPEAKER_01\n That's how the TV handle the bit.\n\n0:15:51\tSPEAKER_01\n You can have a button that says.\n\n0:15:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it's not.\n\n0:15:56\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not that.\n\n0:15:57\tSPEAKER_01\n So you have like a.\n\n0:15:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but that's the second's very add to press those two buttons.\n\n0:16:02\tSPEAKER_04\n It's what Paul says.\n\n0:16:03\tSPEAKER_04\n It's not remote control.\n\n0:16:04\tSPEAKER_04\n That.\n\n0:16:06\tSPEAKER_04\n That makes the TV.\n\n0:16:08\tSPEAKER_04\n Do one to it's the TV.\n\n0:16:10\tSPEAKER_04\n Who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one seconds that you must type one.\n\n0:16:15\tSPEAKER_01\n So if you have a universal TV controller, you need that one button that has two stripes.\n\n0:16:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:22\tSPEAKER_01\n So you have a period of, I don't know, five seconds to press those buttons in that.\n\n0:16:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:27\tSPEAKER_01\n No for elderly people to look.\n\n0:16:29\tSPEAKER_01\n One, two, press and aim and.\n\n0:16:33\tSPEAKER_03\n But do we still need the two level remote control because if you only have that.\n\n0:16:37\tSPEAKER_01\n It's only for television now.\n\n0:16:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:16:39\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't think so.\n\n0:16:40\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:16:41\tSPEAKER_01\n I just thought of another one.\n\n0:16:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Most things in modern TV are also under menu.\n\n0:16:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Do we also need a menu button.\n\n0:16:50\tSPEAKER_01\n And then a navigation.\n\n0:16:54\tSPEAKER_01\n But we can integrate that with volume and previous the next.\n\n0:16:58\tNone\n So you have.\n\n0:16:59\tSPEAKER_02\n I think you really have to divide between functions you often use.\n\n0:17:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Like maybe switch channels and volume and good at kind of things.\n\n0:17:10\tSPEAKER_02\n And the menu button because you almost never use menu button.\n\n0:17:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:17:17\tSPEAKER_03\n But maybe it's still still a good idea.\n\n0:17:19\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm not sure.\n\n0:17:20\tSPEAKER_03\n You would have to use a mute button to.\n\n0:17:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:24\tSPEAKER_01\n A mute button.\n\n0:17:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:17:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe I don't know where you have to put it.\n\n0:17:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, that's, I think that's the latest type.\n\n0:17:32\tSPEAKER_01\n You just now have to figure out what's, what's it put on.\n\n0:17:35\tSPEAKER_01\n What we can use.\n\n0:17:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:17:37\tSPEAKER_01\n And later we can do the design.\n\n0:17:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:17:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Now my personal preference is using the standards.\n\n0:17:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Basic.\n\n0:17:44\tSPEAKER_01\n I think that we should stand out unique.\n\n0:17:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Being unique with the design.\n\n0:17:51\tSPEAKER_01\n So we have to, I don't know, make a different shape than usual.\n\n0:17:55\tSPEAKER_01\n So when you are in the shop and you see our TV control hanging that it stands out.\n\n0:18:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Not just in a row.\n\n0:18:02\tSPEAKER_01\n And you see all the same.\n\n0:18:04\tSPEAKER_03\n You know, same remote controls.\n\n0:18:09\tSPEAKER_03\n It has to be, it has to be a different color.\n\n0:18:11\tSPEAKER_04\n I don't know, different colors.\n\n0:18:13\tSPEAKER_04\n Maybe we can give it out in different colors.\n\n0:18:15\tSPEAKER_04\n You can choose.\n\n0:18:16\tSPEAKER_04\n You like an dynamic or something.\n\n0:18:18\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:19\tSPEAKER_04\n No, why not?\n\n0:18:20\tSPEAKER_04\n Or that's fancy.\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_04\n That's a.\n\n0:18:22\tSPEAKER_03\n It looks cheap as well because it's a small thing.\n\n0:18:24\tSPEAKER_03\n It's only 24 of yours.\n\n0:18:25\tSPEAKER_03\n It looks very cheap if you make it.\n\n0:18:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, maybe we can look at mobile phones.\n\n0:18:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, you just, I don't know what happened.\n\n0:18:32\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, we have to look at mobile phones.\n\n0:18:35\tNone\n That's right.\n\n0:18:36\tSPEAKER_03\n The design very well.\n\n0:18:38\tSPEAKER_01\n And, well, basically, are the same, just a bit smaller.\n\n0:18:42\tSPEAKER_01\n You think you can't make it if you control too small.\n\n0:18:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Because then you will always lose it.\n\n0:18:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:49\tSPEAKER_01\n But, well, I think that's a good example.\n\n0:18:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:18:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, you have to hurry up a bit because I don't know what to make.\n\n0:18:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:18:57\tSPEAKER_01\n You finished again.\n\n0:18:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:19:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:19:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, the working design.\n\n0:19:17\tSPEAKER_02\n The method I use is search the web.\n\n0:19:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Just a web page provided.\n\n0:19:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Basically, I'm not very technical educated, but I could figure it out.\n\n0:19:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Basically, what happens is you press a button.\n\n0:19:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Then the circuit gets closed by pressing the button, like a switch.\n\n0:19:44\tSPEAKER_02\n And by closing that certain circuit, Chip knows what button is pressed.\n\n0:19:50\tSPEAKER_02\n So, like, you press a one, that circuit is closed.\n\n0:19:54\tSPEAKER_02\n And then the Chip produces a pattern, like a Morse code, and sends that to the LED.\n\n0:20:06\tSPEAKER_02\n That's the light emitting diet, I think.\n\n0:20:12\tSPEAKER_02\n And the light emitting diet is producing infrared light.\n\n0:20:17\tSPEAKER_02\n That's invisible to the human eye, and transmit that to the TV.\n\n0:20:27\tSPEAKER_02\n However, there's also a visible diet.\n\n0:20:33\tSPEAKER_02\n That's blinking red, if you look in it.\n\n0:20:36\tSPEAKER_02\n And that's another diet, I believe, because infrared is not visible.\n\n0:20:42\tSPEAKER_02\n So, that's two different things.\n\n0:20:45\tSPEAKER_03\n So, we also have to have a LED.\n\n0:20:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n0:20:50\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm not sure if it's the same thing.\n\n0:20:52\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it's just to indicate that it's active.\n\n0:20:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Or just the green one, because if you use it, it's green, or the red.\n\n0:21:00\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, maybe I think it's in the case that it's active.\n\n0:21:04\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, when you press it.\n\n0:21:06\tSPEAKER_04\n So, the red is just...\n\n0:21:08\tSPEAKER_03\n The red shows up like something's wrong, and green is like, it's okay.\n\n0:21:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I don't know.\n\n0:21:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Almost remote controls is red.\n\n0:21:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:21:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, we make it one.\n\n0:21:20\tSPEAKER_01\n So, maybe we don't have to make red.\n\n0:21:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe integrate it into the design as well.\n\n0:21:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, if the whole remote control becomes green, if you press the button.\n\n0:21:30\tSPEAKER_03\n That's cool.\n\n0:21:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe.\n\n0:21:33\tSPEAKER_02\n I think the batteries will be...\n\n0:21:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Now we have a little recharge.\n\n0:21:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:21:42\tSPEAKER_01\n If you can still make that.\n\n0:21:44\tSPEAKER_01\n It doesn't have to be red, it's just to indicate something.\n\n0:21:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that is working.\n\n0:21:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Not the batteries are low.\n\n0:21:51\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not very important.\n\n0:21:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, just to indicate it's working.\n\n0:21:55\tSPEAKER_02\n And the receptor in the TV senses the pattern.\n\n0:21:58\tSPEAKER_02\n So, we have to understand what patterns are used to make it universal.\n\n0:22:04\tSPEAKER_02\n So, that can be used with all the TVs.\n\n0:22:07\tSPEAKER_02\n And we have to really understand what patterns are used.\n\n0:22:10\tSPEAKER_02\n So, we can...\n\n0:22:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Otherwise, it won't work.\n\n0:22:13\tSPEAKER_01\n So, we have to make buttons for that as well.\n\n0:22:18\tSPEAKER_02\n No, the chip is producing the pattern.\n\n0:22:23\tSPEAKER_02\n So, we have to make a chip that produces patterns to...\n\n0:22:28\tSPEAKER_04\n An automatic search function for each television.\n\n0:22:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, or I don't know exactly how it works.\n\n0:22:36\tSPEAKER_02\n It wasn't explained there.\n\n0:22:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I use a universal remote control.\n\n0:22:42\tSPEAKER_01\n And before we end, you have a list of all the TVs you have, etc.\n\n0:22:47\tSPEAKER_01\n And you have to put in a number.\n\n0:22:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:51\tSPEAKER_04\n So, it works on your TV.\n\n0:22:53\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:22:54\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, I have a modern one.\n\n0:22:55\tSPEAKER_04\n And the modern one.\n\n0:22:56\tSPEAKER_04\n You type a search.\n\n0:22:58\tSPEAKER_04\n And the lead became to Blink.\n\n0:23:00\tSPEAKER_04\n Blink, Blink.\n\n0:23:02\tSPEAKER_04\n And after a short time, the television turns off.\n\n0:23:05\tSPEAKER_04\n And then you know, oh, it's the right one.\n\n0:23:07\tSPEAKER_04\n And you can stop it.\n\n0:23:08\tSPEAKER_04\n And then it's OK.\n\n0:23:09\tSPEAKER_04\n So, you don't have to search for your television or your code.\n\n0:23:12\tSPEAKER_04\n It's the search pattern for itself.\n\n0:23:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, yeah.\n\n0:23:17\tSPEAKER_02\n So, we have to make a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one.\n\n0:23:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Because you have to...\n\n0:23:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Can you just say it again?\n\n0:23:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Because I was just looking at this.\n\n0:23:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, sure.\n\n0:23:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, you have this chip.\n\n0:23:31\tSPEAKER_02\n And it's because when the circuit is closed, it produces the pattern.\n\n0:23:36\tSPEAKER_02\n But basically for brands of TV, these patterns are different.\n\n0:23:42\tSPEAKER_02\n So, like when you press a one on one TV, it goes to one.\n\n0:23:46\tSPEAKER_02\n And on another TV, it won't work, basically.\n\n0:23:49\tSPEAKER_02\n So, basically, what you have to do is get these patterns right.\n\n0:23:55\tSPEAKER_02\n And that can be done by just changing the signal.\n\n0:24:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, changing the signal.\n\n0:24:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, changing the pattern all the time.\n\n0:24:03\tSPEAKER_02\n And what he's doing when he's configuring this pattern, this chip, is trying to switch off the television.\n\n0:24:13\tSPEAKER_02\n And when it's switched off, you can push your button.\n\n0:24:17\tSPEAKER_02\n It's working now.\n\n0:24:19\tSPEAKER_02\n And then he saves that setting.\n\n0:24:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:24:22\tSPEAKER_02\n And then he's working.\n\n0:24:24\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, that's the right option.\n\n0:24:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, the components.\n\n0:24:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, this is a bit technical.\n\n0:24:32\tSPEAKER_02\n And I hadn't, I was a little short on time.\n\n0:24:37\tSPEAKER_02\n But I think I understand it.\n\n0:24:40\tSPEAKER_02\n The energy source is the battery, basically.\n\n0:24:45\tSPEAKER_02\n That's connecting to all the components.\n\n0:24:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Because it has to be fed with energy.\n\n0:24:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, the subcomponent is, I think it is the button pressed.\n\n0:25:01\tSPEAKER_02\n So, basically, when you press a button, a switch gets closed.\n\n0:25:06\tSPEAKER_02\n And that's connecting to a chip.\n\n0:25:09\tSPEAKER_02\n So, the chip knows what button you pressed.\n\n0:25:13\tSPEAKER_02\n And the chip sends out the pattern to the infrared bulb.\n\n0:25:18\tSPEAKER_02\n I didn't put the description by this one.\n\n0:25:21\tSPEAKER_02\n So, the normal flashing lights.\n\n0:25:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:25:25\tSPEAKER_02\n So, that's the LED.\n\n0:25:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:28\tSPEAKER_02\n And this is the LED too.\n\n0:25:29\tSPEAKER_02\n But this one is producing infrared light.\n\n0:25:31\tSPEAKER_02\n It's invisible.\n\n0:25:32\tSPEAKER_02\n And this one is producing normal light.\n\n0:25:34\tSPEAKER_03\n So, we can make the normal one also a normal light.\n\n0:25:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Another LED light is a normal one.\n\n0:25:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Flash up your...\n\n0:25:41\tSPEAKER_04\n If you use the buttons, both of them works.\n\n0:25:45\tSPEAKER_04\n But one you can't see.\n\n0:25:46\tSPEAKER_04\n And one indicates that you use a button.\n\n0:25:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah. Because when you press a button and it doesn't work, it can basically, if the battery is low, it won't work.\n\n0:25:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:58\tSPEAKER_02\n So, you have to indicate that it's...\n\n0:25:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe you have to put a small light around the button you push.\n\n0:26:03\tSPEAKER_03\n So, you see green if you push that button.\n\n0:26:06\tSPEAKER_04\n I think it's a necessary power.\n\n0:26:09\tSPEAKER_04\n You use that.\n\n0:26:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe if you do that, you know that you're sending a signal.\n\n0:26:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:26:14\tSPEAKER_03\n And it's...\n\n0:26:15\tSPEAKER_03\n You also know which button.\n\n0:26:16\tSPEAKER_04\n And the whole remote control, I have to be...\n\n0:26:18\tSPEAKER_04\n Let's.\n\n0:26:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n0:26:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Everywhere and there.\n\n0:26:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Does it make any difference for the energy you use?\n\n0:26:25\tSPEAKER_03\n You still want that.\n\n0:26:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it will look different.\n\n0:26:28\tSPEAKER_01\n And I think we need to find something else.\n\n0:26:31\tSPEAKER_01\n It looks different, yeah.\n\n0:26:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Because otherwise we will just make another standard.\n\n0:26:36\tSPEAKER_01\n And our motto also is...\n\n0:26:38\tSPEAKER_04\n Just let's beneath the buttons.\n\n0:26:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Around the buttons.\n\n0:26:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Or in the buttons, even.\n\n0:26:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:26:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but like when you push it...\n\n0:26:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, then the one that is here.\n\n0:26:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, you have your finger over the button.\n\n0:26:53\tSPEAKER_02\n So you can see...\n\n0:26:54\tSPEAKER_02\n You must be around in there.\n\n0:26:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Or maybe on top of the green light splashing on.\n\n0:26:59\tSPEAKER_04\n Not here.\n\n0:27:00\tSPEAKER_04\n But here.\n\n0:27:01\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, there.\n\n0:27:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe here.\n\n0:27:04\tSPEAKER_03\n The same as a telephone or a mobile phone or...\n\n0:27:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, we're thinking about that.\n\n0:27:11\tSPEAKER_01\n If you're a mobile phone in the dark...\n\n0:27:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Light-set, everything lights up.\n\n0:27:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, it only takes a little energy.\n\n0:27:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, it's a mobile phone.\n\n0:27:19\tSPEAKER_01\n And the phone can do it.\n\n0:27:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, maybe that's a good idea for all people as well.\n\n0:27:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, if you were in the dark, you can't see the numbers.\n\n0:27:26\tSPEAKER_03\n It's only a few letters or any four or something.\n\n0:27:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Four letters.\n\n0:27:30\tSPEAKER_01\n No, I don't know.\n\n0:27:31\tSPEAKER_01\n But if we use a battery station, which I think we'll use.\n\n0:27:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's a good idea.\n\n0:27:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, we'll have enough power to...\n\n0:27:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Everything everyone agrees with that or...\n\n0:27:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:42\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:44\tSPEAKER_04\n Maybe we'll pause it on the home station.\n\n0:27:47\tSPEAKER_04\n I bet you'll call your remote control.\n\n0:27:50\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:27:51\tSPEAKER_03\n But you have to make it sound devised in it.\n\n0:27:54\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, there must be sound in it.\n\n0:27:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, maybe it's that little too hard to make...\n\n0:28:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Especially for that kind of money.\n\n0:28:05\tSPEAKER_02\n It has to be...\n\n0:28:06\tSPEAKER_02\n The production cost is 12.5.\n\n0:28:09\tSPEAKER_04\n 12.5, okay.\n\n0:28:10\tSPEAKER_04\n But we only have to make it for television.\n\n0:28:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:28:14\tSPEAKER_01\n We must have something special.\n\n0:28:16\tSPEAKER_01\n We also have...\n\n0:28:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Remote controls with a lot of options.\n\n0:28:20\tSPEAKER_01\n But we lose about 90% of those options.\n\n0:28:24\tSPEAKER_01\n So I think you can...\n\n0:28:26\tSPEAKER_04\n You have to give customers some extra.\n\n0:28:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:30\tSPEAKER_01\n I think we will save money with that.\n\n0:28:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, you're almost finished.\n\n0:28:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, the personal preference I didn't fill it out.\n\n0:28:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Because it was sure on time.\n\n0:28:39\tSPEAKER_02\n But basically what we could do too is have a Bluetooth integration.\n\n0:28:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I just wanted to talk to some about some more.\n\n0:28:49\tSPEAKER_03\n So maybe you...\n\n0:28:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:51\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:29:02\tSPEAKER_03\n So...\n\n0:29:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, sorry.\n\n0:29:05\tSPEAKER_03\n What's that?\n\n0:29:12\tSPEAKER_03\n So...\n\n0:29:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, sorry.\n\n0:29:14\tSPEAKER_03\n We have some new project requirements.\n\n0:29:16\tSPEAKER_03\n We have to have a look what they are.\n\n0:29:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Still...\n\n0:29:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Teletext has become outdated since the popularity of Internet.\n\n0:29:27\tSPEAKER_03\n So a Teletext option.\n\n0:29:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe we have to skip that one.\n\n0:29:31\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm not sure.\n\n0:29:32\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think so.\n\n0:29:33\tSPEAKER_02\n I think a lot of people use Teletext.\n\n0:29:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, it's on your televisions, only one button.\n\n0:29:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:39\tSPEAKER_03\n We definitely should use it.\n\n0:29:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I told you the remote control should only be used for a televisions.\n\n0:29:46\tSPEAKER_03\n So that's maybe easier.\n\n0:29:48\tSPEAKER_03\n And the 40 plus people already told you.\n\n0:29:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, no, sorry.\n\n0:29:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, this is a problem.\n\n0:29:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, sorry about that.\n\n0:30:00\tSPEAKER_03\n The new product should reach a new market with customers or the young enough 40.\n\n0:30:05\tSPEAKER_03\n So it should be flashy or just...\n\n0:30:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, interesting.\n\n0:30:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Sorry about that, I just didn't read it.\n\n0:30:11\tSPEAKER_03\n So did you make some...\n\n0:30:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Chash...\n\n0:30:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Chash about that?\n\n0:30:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that kind of changed the whole situation.\n\n0:30:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, then we have to make some nice features.\n\n0:30:23\tSPEAKER_01\n I think the thing in the dark is a good way to make more...\n\n0:30:28\tSPEAKER_01\n More like mobile phone.\n\n0:30:30\tSPEAKER_01\n More modern.\n\n0:30:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:32\tSPEAKER_01\n That's important, I think.\n\n0:30:34\tSPEAKER_04\n LCD doesn't work for 12.5 euros, I think.\n\n0:30:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Don't think it's very usable in remote control, especially when you only have TV functions on it.\n\n0:30:45\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:30:47\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think you'll use it often because you can see on the television what channel you...\n\n0:30:52\tSPEAKER_04\n Watching that channel one.\n\n0:30:54\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:30:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I think that's not usable now.\n\n0:30:59\tSPEAKER_01\n So, but...\n\n0:31:01\tSPEAKER_01\n What other features can we put in?\n\n0:31:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:05\tSPEAKER_02\n I think you have to make it a bit flashy and popular.\n\n0:31:12\tSPEAKER_02\n And then the usability is not that required because like in the mobile phones, usability is not that good, I think.\n\n0:31:20\tSPEAKER_04\n Some of you had something to read about speech recognition, about you said one and the television turns on one.\n\n0:31:28\tSPEAKER_04\n Is that reachable, maybe?\n\n0:31:30\tSPEAKER_04\n That's fair.\n\n0:31:31\tSPEAKER_04\n That's easy, that's cool.\n\n0:31:32\tSPEAKER_04\n It's 12, for each one.\n\n0:31:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:31:36\tSPEAKER_04\n Only the numbers, only numbers, furthermore nothing, but only the numbers, one to 20 or something.\n\n0:31:41\tSPEAKER_04\n That should be cool.\n\n0:31:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, maybe we have to integrate that as well.\n\n0:31:45\tSPEAKER_03\n If it's possible.\n\n0:31:47\tSPEAKER_03\n If it's possible, I don't know.\n\n0:31:48\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know. I don't think it's very expensive actually.\n\n0:31:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:52\tSPEAKER_03\n You only have for microphone.\n\n0:31:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:54\tSPEAKER_02\n It has to work.\n\n0:31:55\tSPEAKER_02\n And does it have to work only in English or in Dutch too?\n\n0:31:59\tSPEAKER_04\n No, maybe.\n\n0:32:00\tSPEAKER_04\n Ah, that's a problem.\n\n0:32:01\tSPEAKER_02\n And...\n\n0:32:02\tSPEAKER_02\n I only know English.\n\n0:32:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:05\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know how to speak in Dutch or...\n\n0:32:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it's probably my job to figure that out.\n\n0:32:09\tSPEAKER_01\n I can use cream from wherever.\n\n0:32:12\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:32:13\tSPEAKER_01\n One.\n\n0:32:14\tSPEAKER_04\n I don't know. We have to think about that, but do we do it?\n\n0:32:18\tSPEAKER_01\n No, I don't know.\n\n0:32:19\tSPEAKER_01\n If we do it.\n\n0:32:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Is it very usable?\n\n0:32:21\tSPEAKER_01\n That's what I'm looking at.\n\n0:32:22\tSPEAKER_02\n And do you have to speak in like anything or...\n\n0:32:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe it's too hard to realize that.\n\n0:32:28\tSPEAKER_03\n We have short time to put it on the market.\n\n0:32:31\tSPEAKER_03\n So that you have to do a lot of testing before we can do that.\n\n0:32:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, thanks.\n\n0:32:36\tSPEAKER_02\n You can make it...\n\n0:32:37\tSPEAKER_03\n You can make the remote control very flexible.\n\n0:32:40\tSPEAKER_04\n Indeed, the languages are a difficult thing.\n\n0:32:42\tSPEAKER_04\n Because we...\n\n0:32:44\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know if it's useful enough to take the effort to design something with speech recognition.\n\n0:32:52\tSPEAKER_02\n And also, if you have a good speech recognition, you can just throw the...\n\n0:32:59\tSPEAKER_04\n Someone says...\n\n0:33:00\tSPEAKER_04\n The remote control.\n\n0:33:01\tSPEAKER_04\n Give me one code.\n\n0:33:02\tSPEAKER_04\n And the TV turns on to one.\n\n0:33:04\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not to go out of the electromagnetic.\n\n0:33:06\tSPEAKER_01\n But then you have to say a TV channel one.\n\n0:33:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Not just one.\n\n0:33:12\tSPEAKER_04\n But TV one.\n\n0:33:13\tSPEAKER_04\n That becomes...\n\n0:33:14\tSPEAKER_04\n Because that's very hard for speech recognition.\n\n0:33:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, you know, but I don't think it's just an useful enough.\n\n0:33:22\tSPEAKER_03\n So we have to make some decisions.\n\n0:33:24\tSPEAKER_03\n So you can see on the...\n\n0:33:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, no speech recognition.\n\n0:33:27\tSPEAKER_03\n So we have to know what we're going to put on.\n\n0:33:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Do we make a light under the...\n\n0:33:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Under the numbers and everything?\n\n0:33:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I think.\n\n0:33:35\tSPEAKER_03\n If you press something, it lights up for a few seconds.\n\n0:33:38\tSPEAKER_03\n You can see what other buttons there are.\n\n0:33:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay?\n\n0:33:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that's good.\n\n0:33:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, we just take that one.\n\n0:33:44\tSPEAKER_01\n And what else we do?\n\n0:33:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Also the one in the dark.\n\n0:33:47\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:33:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Light's up when it's dark.\n\n0:33:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but I thought that would be the same if you push something.\n\n0:33:53\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, it doesn't work all the time.\n\n0:33:56\tSPEAKER_04\n It doesn't work only when you use it.\n\n0:33:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Are you going to switch it on or something?\n\n0:34:01\tSPEAKER_03\n No, if you use one button, it must turn on for 20 seconds.\n\n0:34:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n0:34:06\tSPEAKER_00\n It's the same as a telephone.\n\n0:34:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, all right.\n\n0:34:09\tSPEAKER_03\n And do we use a...\n\n0:34:13\tSPEAKER_03\n What's it called?\n\n0:34:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Like an iMac, and if you can look through it, or just normal.\n\n0:34:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe it's an option.\n\n0:34:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe it's an option.\n\n0:34:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Like we discussed like iPod, different colors, maybe use even different fonts.\n\n0:34:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Like a phone.\n\n0:34:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Different colors, okay?\n\n0:34:30\tSPEAKER_01\n So you just make it...\n\n0:34:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it's cool.\n\n0:34:33\tSPEAKER_01\n As an option, maybe.\n\n0:34:35\tSPEAKER_03\n And so the buttons we have...\n\n0:34:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, this is normal.\n\n0:34:38\tSPEAKER_03\n We put in the simple buttons on the top, and probably the more complicated buttons.\n\n0:34:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but there's a lot of different buttons.\n\n0:34:45\tSPEAKER_01\n We don't really have any...\n\n0:34:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, maybe you have...\n\n0:34:48\tSPEAKER_03\n You have to...\n\n0:34:49\tSPEAKER_03\n When you use teletext, you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one, or to go to the previous one.\n\n0:34:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I think the buttons are very easy, with just standard buttons.\n\n0:35:01\tSPEAKER_03\n But maybe you can put the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control,\n\n0:35:07\tSPEAKER_01\n because you almost never use it. Teletext options are only for buttons or something.\n\n0:35:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but younger people, I think, more often use the internet, and elderly people often use teletext.\n\n0:35:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n0:35:23\tSPEAKER_04\n I use teletexts every day, I think.\n\n0:35:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, for me too.\n\n0:35:27\tSPEAKER_03\n So we just give it one level, then.\n\n0:35:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, yeah, one level.\n\n0:35:30\tSPEAKER_01\n And I think, because we don't have that many buttons, I think the design is most important.\n\n0:35:36\tSPEAKER_01\n You can integrate the buttons in the design very much, because the door is simple buttons.\n\n0:35:41\tSPEAKER_01\n If you put one above it, it's clear.\n\n0:35:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:35:44\tSPEAKER_03\n So that's it for...\n\n0:35:48\tSPEAKER_03\n We're going to have a lunch break.\n\n0:35:53\tSPEAKER_03\n How long is lunch break?\n\n0:35:57\tSPEAKER_03\n So yeah, you know what you have to do with this.\n\n0:36:01\tSPEAKER_03\n This is it.\n\n0:36:03\tSPEAKER_03\n You get your meal and everything.\n\n0:36:05\tSPEAKER_04\n Trans-watching, okay?\n\n0:36:07\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:08\tNone\n That's fun.\n\n0:36:15\tSPEAKER_04\n Yo.\n\n0:36:19\tSPEAKER_03\n So we finished work for this time.\n\n0:36:22\tSPEAKER_03\n We can just move in.\n\n0:36:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:36:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Bye.\n\n0:36:35\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, we need to go to the bathroom.\n\n0:36:41\tSPEAKER_04\n I think the office is over there.\n\n0:36:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:44\tSPEAKER_02\n We can eat something.\n\n0:36:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, we can eat lunch.\n\n0:36:48\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:50\tNone\n Have you seen this?\n\n0:36:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I've seen it a lot of times.\n\n0:36:55\tSPEAKER_03\n I think you can see the frame.\n\n0:36:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe you have a leg in the middle.\n\n0:36:59\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:00\tSPEAKER_04\n Do you have a leg?\n\n0:37:02\tNone\n Yeah, we're going to the bathroom.\n\n0:37:05\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:37:15\tNone\n Okay.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "SPEAKER_03, SPEAKer_03 and SPEER_04 are written by Speaker and not by him or her.
