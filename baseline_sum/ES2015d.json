yeah.\n\n0:00:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Why do we have two different microsoft?\n\n0:00:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:00:39\tSPEAKER_01\n What would the difference be?\n\n0:00:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, the difference would be...\n\n0:00:44\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm tapping.\n\n0:00:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, I can't see where your screen is.\n\n0:00:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Alright.\n\n0:00:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, here you go.\n\n0:01:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Alright.\n\n0:01:05\tSPEAKER_01\n The agenda for this...\n\n0:01:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh.\n\n0:01:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Alright.\n\n0:01:09\tSPEAKER_01\n The agenda for this meeting is who initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers.\n\n0:01:17\tSPEAKER_01\n And then we will evaluate it, given the criteria that we gave it.\n\n0:01:24\tSPEAKER_01\n And talk about our finances, whether we were under or over our budget.\n\n0:01:29\tSPEAKER_01\n I have a spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of what we've made, given our options, and evaluate the product as a group.\n\n0:01:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:01:44\tSPEAKER_01\n And so first we'll have the prototype presentation.\n\n0:01:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Do you need the PowerPoint?\n\n0:01:50\tSPEAKER_00\n I just got a piece like.\n\n0:01:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Alright.\n\n0:01:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Thank you.\n\n0:01:57\tSPEAKER_02\n That's nice.\n\n0:02:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, here we are.\n\n0:02:08\tSPEAKER_02\n This is what we came up with.\n\n0:02:11\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a pretty simple design, it's based on a mine-goal.\n\n0:02:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Mine-goal.\n\n0:02:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:02:22\tSPEAKER_02\n And we have the company logo here.\n\n0:02:25\tSPEAKER_02\n And this will be the...\n\n0:02:28\tSPEAKER_02\n...imperage.\n\n0:02:29\tSPEAKER_02\n The air.\n\n0:02:30\tSPEAKER_02\n And this will be the PowerPoint.\n\n0:02:32\tSPEAKER_02\n The...\n\n0:02:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, okay.\n\n0:02:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:02:35\tSPEAKER_02\n So what was it?\n\n0:02:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Where's the LED?\n\n0:02:37\tSPEAKER_02\n It's in the middle of the middle of the little arch.\n\n0:02:39\tSPEAKER_02\n So I want this to be higher.\n\n0:02:41\tSPEAKER_02\n And we just have a sample design we wanted it all to be...\n\n0:02:46\tSPEAKER_02\n...pum hell.\n\n0:02:47\tSPEAKER_02\n...pum hell.\n\n0:02:48\tSPEAKER_02\n...yes, pum hell.\n\n0:02:49\tSPEAKER_02\n And all the...\n\n0:02:51\tSPEAKER_02\n...potenters are accepted.\n\n0:02:53\tSPEAKER_02\n And we've done...\n\n0:02:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Mostly have a number 10 button.\n\n0:02:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, that was a mistake, isn't it?\n\n0:02:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Right, it will be cool.\n\n0:03:01\tSPEAKER_00\n...no, it will be cool.\n\n0:03:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Tell me, can I want to ask you something?\n\n0:03:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Sorry.\n\n0:03:09\tSPEAKER_02\n I was in charge of the number.\n\n0:03:11\tSPEAKER_02\n And this is just...\n\n0:03:12\tSPEAKER_02\n...and we've got like a lab in the class.\n\n0:03:15\tSPEAKER_00\n The plus?\n\n0:03:17\tSPEAKER_00\n So one plus one.\n\n0:03:18\tSPEAKER_02\n You have an O.\n\n0:03:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Press a plus button.\n\n0:03:21\tSPEAKER_02\n I need to do a one plus.\n\n0:03:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:03:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, okay.\n\n0:03:25\tSPEAKER_01\n I've never heard of that kind before.\n\n0:03:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, we just thought we have all the numbers here.\n\n0:03:29\tSPEAKER_02\n So we wanted something...\n\n0:03:31\tSPEAKER_02\n...representative with numbers larger than 10.\n\n0:03:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:03:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Because if you...\n\n0:03:36\tSPEAKER_00\n...on your average...\n\n0:03:38\tSPEAKER_00\n...remote, if you press one twice, you just go to...\n\n0:03:42\tSPEAKER_00\n...or say, you wanted channel 12, you press one...\n\n0:03:45\tSPEAKER_00\n...and you go channel one, and then two, then you just go to channel two instead of 12.\n\n0:03:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, just not...\n\n0:03:51\tSPEAKER_00\n So if you just like one plus two, you could go to...\n\n0:03:54\tSPEAKER_00\n...1012 or two plus two.\n\n0:03:55\tSPEAKER_00\n But you do this channel 10.\n\n0:03:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two?\n\n0:03:59\tSPEAKER_02\n No, no.\n\n0:04:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, that's where you have all these numbers, these numbers.\n\n0:04:03\tSPEAKER_02\n These numbers all work independently, up to nine.\n\n0:04:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but I mean, if you press it, it'll go to that channel, right away.\n\n0:04:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:04:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Because you've got to press the plus afterwards.\n\n0:04:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, no.\n\n0:04:17\tSPEAKER_02\n The plus doesn't occur.\n\n0:04:18\tSPEAKER_02\n I've just gone past number nine.\n\n0:04:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I know.\n\n0:04:21\tSPEAKER_01\n But if I want to go to say number, like 65, channel 65, but I press the six, it'll go to channel six.\n\n0:04:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh.\n\n0:04:30\tSPEAKER_01\n And then I'll press the plus, and then we'll go to 65, and then put the five, and we'll go to 65.\n\n0:04:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Then you press the plus first.\n\n0:04:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh.\n\n0:04:35\tSPEAKER_02\n It doesn't...\n\n0:04:36\tSPEAKER_02\n We haven't pressed.\n\n0:04:37\tSPEAKER_02\n I wouldn't have thought you pressed the plus, but it's a number six, but she's very close.\n\n0:04:41\tSPEAKER_02\n She has to do it.\n\n0:04:42\tSPEAKER_00\n What do you say to define that?\n\n0:04:44\tSPEAKER_00\n I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first.\n\n0:04:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:04:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Like, on the way to channel six.\n\n0:04:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it wouldn't be a problem.\n\n0:04:53\tSPEAKER_01\n But I was just wondering, like, as long as we realize that's what it'll do.\n\n0:04:56\tSPEAKER_03\n There's a delay on remotes, I think, where you can have it.\n\n0:04:59\tSPEAKER_03\n It's like a five-second input time.\n\n0:05:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, as long as we hit them, that...\n\n0:05:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that...\n\n0:05:05\tSPEAKER_03\n It should be fine.\n\n0:05:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:07\tSPEAKER_03\n As long as there's not a big pause between the two buttons.\n\n0:05:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:11\tSPEAKER_03\n So, on the top there is volume and channel.\n\n0:05:16\tSPEAKER_00\n And channel.\n\n0:05:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Which is so...\n\n0:05:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, cool.\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_00\n You can just see and feel like that without thinking about it.\n\n0:05:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Where's the power button?\n\n0:05:24\tSPEAKER_00\n It's in the network.\n\n0:05:25\tSPEAKER_00\n It's in the network.\n\n0:05:26\tSPEAKER_00\n It's in the network.\n\n0:05:27\tSPEAKER_00\n It's in the network.\n\n0:05:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh.\n\n0:05:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh.\n\n0:05:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Like it's fast but with...\n\n0:05:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Taking your hand off the remote.\n\n0:05:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:35\tSPEAKER_00\n And we went for, like, a circular design for the numbers, because we thought that was kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb.\n\n0:05:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:05:47\tSPEAKER_00\n A economic zero-considering.\n\n0:05:48\tSPEAKER_00\n A economic...\n\n0:05:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:50\tSPEAKER_02\n It might actually help with repetitive stress, injury.\n\n0:05:54\tSPEAKER_00\n It could cause another type of repetition.\n\n0:05:56\tSPEAKER_00\n But yeah, no, I mean it's a different movement.\n\n0:05:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:01\tSPEAKER_00\n And the feel of it, I mean we've made this out of Plato, which is representing the, you know, the world.\n\n0:06:08\tSPEAKER_00\n The spongy, the revenant.\n\n0:06:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Because it was said before in the materials specification that this anti-RSI materials often use in stressful.\n\n0:06:19\tSPEAKER_00\n So this has got a bit of give to it.\n\n0:06:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, the stress bar feel.\n\n0:06:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Do you like feel it yourself?\n\n0:06:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:06:26\tSPEAKER_01\n How fit my work.\n\n0:06:27\tSPEAKER_01\n How of your hand?\n\n0:06:28\tSPEAKER_01\n My goodness.\n\n0:06:29\tSPEAKER_01\n There you go.\n\n0:06:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Hey, did you?\n\n0:06:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Did you?\n\n0:06:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Did you?\n\n0:06:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, it's nice.\n\n0:06:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, I think I killed the five.\n\n0:06:36\tSPEAKER_03\n I did.\n\n0:06:37\tSPEAKER_00\n I did four.\n\n0:06:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, god.\n\n0:06:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, as for the colours, we were presented with a limited range.\n\n0:06:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Of colours for this prototype.\n\n0:06:45\tSPEAKER_00\n But we're thinking that, seeing as we're having an interchangeable casing, we're thinking of the way that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use or the combination.\n\n0:06:59\tSPEAKER_00\n And we're thinking to carry on with the fruit and vegetable theme, the colour combination just to be named after different fruit.\n\n0:07:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, no.\n\n0:07:10\tSPEAKER_00\n We're black and yellow, water, and green.\n\n0:07:13\tSPEAKER_00\n You know, the vanilla might be the most popular bit just the lens.\n\n0:07:17\tSPEAKER_00\n More subtle cream, the other colour.\n\n0:07:20\tSPEAKER_00\n It looks more like a bit garish.\n\n0:07:21\tSPEAKER_01\n I do like vanilla and banana wood.\n\n0:07:23\tSPEAKER_00\n But Anna is more representative of our colour scheme, like the company, the yellow and the black.\n\n0:07:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, okay.\n\n0:07:30\tSPEAKER_00\n So for corporate identity, that would probably be the most abstract.\n\n0:07:33\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, watermelon, you know, probably appealing to the business.\n\n0:07:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Kind of Christmas, you know.\n\n0:07:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Seasonal.\n\n0:07:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Apple, green, brown, more kind of trendy, you know.\n\n0:07:42\tSPEAKER_02\n The paragonal kind of girly and funky kind of.\n\n0:07:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Cool.\n\n0:07:49\tSPEAKER_02\n And the most sophisticated costume.\n\n0:07:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:54\tSPEAKER_02\n That's the most old decor.\n\n0:07:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:07:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we saw the components.\n\n0:08:02\tSPEAKER_00\n It was definitely a focus of ergonomics.\n\n0:08:06\tSPEAKER_00\n And just a single handheld device.\n\n0:08:09\tSPEAKER_00\n And you don't need to use both hands.\n\n0:08:12\tSPEAKER_00\n One hand to hold this and type in with the other.\n\n0:08:15\tSPEAKER_00\n You can just use your thumb.\n\n0:08:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_00\n As you said, the rubber is probably used for a couple of better anti-RSI.\n\n0:08:22\tSPEAKER_01\n That's about it.\n\n0:08:23\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:08:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Thank you very much.\n\n0:08:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Good work, everyone.\n\n0:08:26\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:08:28\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:08:30\tSPEAKER_01\n And so now that we have a prototype, we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches what our budget can handle.\n\n0:08:40\tSPEAKER_01\n So I have something I'm going to.\n\n0:08:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, what do you need to do at presentation first?\n\n0:08:49\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know what order it goes up.\n\n0:08:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:52\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm going to check that out for a second.\n\n0:08:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Which I didn't.\n\n0:08:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Sorry.\n\n0:08:58\tSPEAKER_01\n You're right.\n\n0:08:59\tSPEAKER_01\n The evaluation criteria is this.\n\n0:09:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:06\tSPEAKER_04\n So.\n\n0:09:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:09:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Come on, my computer.\n\n0:09:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Sorry, my computer is going to be technical difficulties.\n\n0:09:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Just press out and press the grade again.\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Also, I did that.\n\n0:09:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:09:41\tSPEAKER_03\n All right.\n\n0:09:43\tSPEAKER_01\n And then again, I think.\n\n0:09:46\tSPEAKER_01\n One more time.\n\n0:09:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, still not there.\n\n0:09:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:10:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Now, I think for this one, I could do as before, use the whiteboard or maybe I'll just do it on right on the screen, where you can see it.\n\n0:10:09\tSPEAKER_03\n We're going to be doing an evaluation report together based on the prototype that we've just seen.\n\n0:10:14\tSPEAKER_03\n And looking back at my notes from our, with our conceptual and our functional meetings, I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were back to our kickoff meeting this morning.\n\n0:10:25\tSPEAKER_03\n And we'll evaluate as to whether we've done what we set up to do.\n\n0:10:30\tSPEAKER_03\n And we're going to do it on a one to seven scale, where one is true and seven is false.\n\n0:10:35\tSPEAKER_03\n So basically the lower the points, the better.\n\n0:10:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:10:41\tSPEAKER_03\n So question number one.\n\n0:10:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Does the remote, whoops.\n\n0:10:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Sorry.\n\n0:10:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, I'm not going to be able to, I'll do it on the whiteboard.\n\n0:10:47\tSPEAKER_03\n I can't change it.\n\n0:10:48\tSPEAKER_03\n So I'm going to ask you to push it down once.\n\n0:10:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:10:52\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll write down our scores up on the.\n\n0:10:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:10:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Number one, do we have a fancy look and feel?\n\n0:11:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Feel, I think.\n\n0:11:05\tSPEAKER_00\n I think quite successful with the, yeah, rubber coating.\n\n0:11:10\tSPEAKER_01\n The look is a little bit more playful.\n\n0:11:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, it depends on your definition of fancy, but it's definitely different.\n\n0:11:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, definitely.\n\n0:11:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:19\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:20\tSPEAKER_00\n I think the color has a lot to do with it.\n\n0:11:23\tSPEAKER_00\n The colors we were given for making the photos like aren't the colors that I think we would have necessarily chosen.\n\n0:11:31\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not the kind of.\n\n0:11:32\tSPEAKER_00\n I thought we were given red and black.\n\n0:11:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Red, black and yellow and orange.\n\n0:11:38\tSPEAKER_00\n I guess.\n\n0:11:39\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't want to go for black because most people are to black and grey, so you want to stand\n\n0:11:47\tSPEAKER_00\n out that way in here. If you can imagine that in maybe a kind of pale metallic finish or something.\n\n0:12:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, I know it's for rubber.\n\n0:12:03\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, you can visualize this in nice colors.\n\n0:12:06\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it would look great.\n\n0:12:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:09\tSPEAKER_03\n I kind of like the potato look.\n\n0:12:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, well, I was wondering if it would make me.\n\n0:12:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, sorry, the mango.\n\n0:12:14\tSPEAKER_03\n It's fine.\n\n0:12:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Fruit or vegetable depends on your mood.\n\n0:12:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Totally.\n\n0:12:21\tSPEAKER_01\n So myself would say a one or two.\n\n0:12:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:24\tSPEAKER_01\n I would say two.\n\n0:12:25\tSPEAKER_02\n I would say two.\n\n0:12:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:12:27\tSPEAKER_02\n And one being true.\n\n0:12:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:30\tSPEAKER_00\n So I add two.\n\n0:12:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Two.\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:12:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Actually, that's what you're confusing.\n\n0:12:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:12:39\tSPEAKER_03\n So question number two was, is it technologically innovative?\n\n0:12:45\tSPEAKER_03\n So I know we have the kinetic energy, which is very innovative.\n\n0:12:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:49\tSPEAKER_00\n And the use of the rubber.\n\n0:12:50\tSPEAKER_00\n The use of the rubber, the use of the LAD.\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_00\n The LAD isn't musically innovative.\n\n0:12:58\tSPEAKER_00\n And we don't have any scroll buttons.\n\n0:13:00\tSPEAKER_00\n It's all push buttons.\n\n0:13:01\tSPEAKER_00\n There's no LAD control.\n\n0:13:03\tSPEAKER_00\n So if you're thinking about the rest of the market.\n\n0:13:06\tSPEAKER_00\n It's probably halfway in some aspects it is.\n\n0:13:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:11\tSPEAKER_03\n I think we have three.\n\n0:13:13\tSPEAKER_03\n And I think, I mean, it's tough to say because we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this.\n\n0:13:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Because then I would want to say, we want this to be the purpose.\n\n0:13:20\tSPEAKER_03\n So I mean, we'll put three, but I think we actually reached our goal.\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:25\tSPEAKER_03\n We didn't want it any more than that.\n\n0:13:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:13:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Question number three, will it be easy to use?\n\n0:13:30\tSPEAKER_01\n I think so.\n\n0:13:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:33\tSPEAKER_03\n I think one.\n\n0:13:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:35\tSPEAKER_03\n I can't really get confused with that.\n\n0:13:37\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, we have to work out the number plus the pluses.\n\n0:13:40\tSPEAKER_03\n The pluses, but once that's figured out, it's half the tenning on.\n\n0:13:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Number four, is this a good looking remote?\n\n0:13:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Remember that 75% of users find most remote controls ugly.\n\n0:13:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Again, I think the color comes into this.\n\n0:13:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, color will definitely be effective.\n\n0:13:56\tSPEAKER_01\n I think that the logo could be smaller.\n\n0:13:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:14:00\tSPEAKER_01\n And maybe an odd to the prominent way.\n\n0:14:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe like at the bottom.\n\n0:14:05\tSPEAKER_02\n The management said that it had to be prominent.\n\n0:14:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, it just had to be on there.\n\n0:14:10\tSPEAKER_01\n I just did not touch it.\n\n0:14:12\tSPEAKER_03\n It's time it's in three I killed.\n\n0:14:17\tSPEAKER_03\n I was just wondering if it should be like flatter.\n\n0:14:21\tSPEAKER_01\n I suppose I've got quite the appeal of it being like a big glob.\n\n0:14:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:27\tSPEAKER_02\n But you know what I've just thought of?\n\n0:14:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe it's the bottom is just sort of flat.\n\n0:14:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, the bottom could be like chopped a bit.\n\n0:14:35\tSPEAKER_02\n But then around.\n\n0:14:36\tSPEAKER_02\n That's true.\n\n0:14:38\tSPEAKER_02\n It would still be comfortable.\n\n0:14:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe it could be on the bottom.\n\n0:14:43\tSPEAKER_03\n So you wouldn't like if it's flat here.\n\n0:14:47\tSPEAKER_03\n So it sits up like that.\n\n0:14:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, that was the only thing.\n\n0:14:51\tSPEAKER_01\n I'll follow over all the time.\n\n0:14:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, it's less.\n\n0:14:55\tSPEAKER_03\n If it's weighted maybe.\n\n0:14:58\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a good looking remote.\n\n0:15:01\tSPEAKER_03\n We want to show it off to our friends.\n\n0:15:04\tSPEAKER_02\n You were though.\n\n0:15:06\tSPEAKER_02\n It's more interesting.\n\n0:15:08\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it was another color and it was like.\n\n0:15:12\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it look okay.\n\n0:15:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe two.\n\n0:15:16\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, I would make it that way rather than like your average.\n\n0:15:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Remind like that.\n\n0:15:22\tSPEAKER_00\n But definitely another color.\n\n0:15:24\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not happy with that.\n\n0:15:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, so should we say two?\n\n0:15:27\tSPEAKER_03\n For that, sure.\n\n0:15:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:15:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Question number five.\n\n0:15:33\tSPEAKER_03\n What's?\n\n0:15:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Will people be willing to spend 25 euros on this product?\n\n0:15:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Remember that 80% of users were willing to spend more money when remote control looked fancy?\n\n0:15:41\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we have to market it in the right way.\n\n0:15:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:45\tSPEAKER_02\n To say that is a simple thing.\n\n0:15:46\tSPEAKER_02\n So people don't just say it and think.\n\n0:15:48\tSPEAKER_02\n This is so simple to say.\n\n0:15:50\tSPEAKER_02\n I do want to spend 25 euros.\n\n0:15:52\tSPEAKER_02\n You have to market.\n\n0:15:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:54\tSPEAKER_03\n The marketing of lots of units.\n\n0:15:55\tSPEAKER_03\n The kinetic energy.\n\n0:15:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:58\tSPEAKER_00\n The kinetic energy.\n\n0:15:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Holy.\n\n0:16:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, no.\n\n0:16:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Shake it.\n\n0:16:05\tSPEAKER_00\n It's awful.\n\n0:16:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Shake it.\n\n0:16:07\tSPEAKER_00\n It's awful.\n\n0:16:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Say it in.\n\n0:16:09\tSPEAKER_02\n There's a B-Five of you.\n\n0:16:10\tSPEAKER_03\n No, I guess I don't know much about the remote control industry.\n\n0:16:12\tSPEAKER_03\n How much your average sells for?\n\n0:16:14\tSPEAKER_03\n But you're a marketing expert.\n\n0:16:16\tSPEAKER_03\n I know I am.\n\n0:16:17\tSPEAKER_02\n I think they're quite 10.\n\n0:16:19\tSPEAKER_02\n 10.\n\n0:16:20\tSPEAKER_02\n But you don't have to buy batteries.\n\n0:16:24\tSPEAKER_03\n So in the long term, this can actually save you my household.\n\n0:16:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:27\tSPEAKER_01\n So I'll market it that way.\n\n0:16:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Exactly.\n\n0:16:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:30\tSPEAKER_03\n So yeah, I think with a good marketing scheme and the personalization options.\n\n0:16:33\tSPEAKER_03\n So yeah, I would give it a two.\n\n0:16:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:16:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Number six.\n\n0:16:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Can someone read it out?\n\n0:16:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Does this prototype match the operating behavior of the alpha-g?\n\n0:16:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:46\tSPEAKER_03\n So that was mainly that.\n\n0:16:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:48\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it does.\n\n0:16:49\tSPEAKER_00\n It's artistic.\n\n0:16:50\tSPEAKER_00\n It's like the most accessible buttons are the volume and the channel changing.\n\n0:16:55\tSPEAKER_00\n And it's just you don't have to think about it.\n\n0:16:57\tSPEAKER_00\n You don't have to look down to find them.\n\n0:16:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Clearly they're easy to use.\n\n0:17:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:04\tSPEAKER_03\n I guess the I think the keyword there is average.\n\n0:17:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Because there were some people that used the video input and sound and stuff.\n\n0:17:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:09\tSPEAKER_03\n But they're not you and I really.\n\n0:17:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:17:13\tSPEAKER_03\n So one.\n\n0:17:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:17:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Number seven.\n\n0:17:17\tSPEAKER_03\n How do you push it down?\n\n0:17:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:21\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it's going to be easy to find when lost.\n\n0:17:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Remember that 50% of users lose their own regularly.\n\n0:17:25\tSPEAKER_02\n We had the alarm system.\n\n0:17:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Is the alarm system still implemented?\n\n0:17:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:29\tSPEAKER_02\n When you press the alarm system, the light.\n\n0:17:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Light on the end or flash the ball.\n\n0:17:33\tSPEAKER_00\n But I mean, it's not obviously obvious from the outside.\n\n0:17:36\tSPEAKER_00\n That's going to happen.\n\n0:17:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Because you can't particularly see the light on the inside.\n\n0:17:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:43\tSPEAKER_02\n The light.\n\n0:17:44\tSPEAKER_02\n It will.\n\n0:17:45\tSPEAKER_00\n But when the alarm's not.\n\n0:17:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:48\tSPEAKER_01\n If you must button makes a noise, right?\n\n0:17:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:51\tSPEAKER_02\n It turns into a darkening starts cracking.\n\n0:17:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Here I am.\n\n0:17:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Awesome.\n\n0:17:55\tSPEAKER_00\n I think if it was having an alarm system, I mean, when it lights up, I mean, it could light up when the alarm went.\n\n0:18:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:02\tSPEAKER_00\n But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something, it wouldn't be any point.\n\n0:18:05\tSPEAKER_00\n So you can't see the alarm.\n\n0:18:08\tSPEAKER_00\n But it would like to.\n\n0:18:09\tSPEAKER_01\n I thought it was going to make a noise.\n\n0:18:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:19\tSPEAKER_03\n We can't see an alarm inside.\n\n0:18:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Just the alarm system itself.\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:18:22\tSPEAKER_03\n You're just explaining why it's not on the prototype.\n\n0:18:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:28\tSPEAKER_03\n So we can say that.\n\n0:18:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Sorry.\n\n0:18:31\tNone\n We can give it a one because compared to every other remote ever made, this one will be easier to find.\n\n0:18:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:18:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Sorry.\n\n0:18:34\tSPEAKER_03\n The question number eight.\n\n0:18:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new?\n\n0:18:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Remember that 34% of users usually found it difficult.\n\n0:18:38\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:18:39\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:18:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:45\tSPEAKER_00\n I think just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic.\n\n0:18:52\tSPEAKER_00\n But I think that itself makes it.\n\n0:18:54\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a make more sense for the middle one to be just an enter button.\n\n0:18:57\tSPEAKER_03\n So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least.\n\n0:19:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:01\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's just like channel six.\n\n0:19:02\tSPEAKER_01\n That's.\n\n0:19:03\tSPEAKER_01\n And.\n\n0:19:04\tSPEAKER_01\n And.\n\n0:19:05\tSPEAKER_02\n And.\n\n0:19:06\tSPEAKER_02\n And.\n\n0:19:07\tSPEAKER_02\n And.\n\n0:19:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:10\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:19:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:19:12\tSPEAKER_00\n So.\n\n0:19:13\tSPEAKER_00\n So.\n\n0:19:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:19:15\tSPEAKER_00\n So.\n\n0:19:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:19:17\tSPEAKER_03\n So we can.\n\n0:19:18\tSPEAKER_03\n We'll say yes.\n\n0:19:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:20\tSPEAKER_03\n One.\n\n0:19:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:19:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Question number nine.\n\n0:19:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, minimize the effects of our SI, which was repeated strain in.\n\n0:19:32\tSPEAKER_03\n In.\n\n0:19:39\tSPEAKER_01\n And.\n\n0:19:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Which affected over a quarter of users.\n\n0:19:42\tSPEAKER_01\n I think so.\n\n0:19:43\tSPEAKER_00\n It's like right in the.\n\n0:19:45\tSPEAKER_00\n But if yours.\n\n0:19:46\tSPEAKER_00\n You thumb might get a little.\n\n0:19:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:49\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't think we may have to do some more research in the other strain injuries that we don't know about.\n\n0:19:53\tSPEAKER_01\n It is soft.\n\n0:19:54\tSPEAKER_01\n And that's kind of what the.\n\n0:19:58\tSPEAKER_01\n And people PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for.\n\n0:20:01\tSPEAKER_01\n So.\n\n0:20:02\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know what other options we get.\n\n0:20:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:05\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, you can hold on to your left hand and.\n\n0:20:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Use your index figure.\n\n0:20:09\tSPEAKER_03\n But there's not really any other options.\n\n0:20:11\tSPEAKER_03\n It's like a keyboard.\n\n0:20:12\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:20:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:14\tSPEAKER_03\n I think we did as much as you can with the local troll.\n\n0:20:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:17\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:20:18\tSPEAKER_03\n One or two, do you think.\n\n0:20:20\tSPEAKER_00\n I think.\n\n0:20:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I think two.\n\n0:20:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:20:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:20:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Number 10.\n\n0:20:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Did we somehow incorporate the company color and logo?\n\n0:20:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:20:29\tSPEAKER_03\n And the color is going to be there even if it's like vanilla is the yellow.\n\n0:20:32\tSPEAKER_02\n We can't really do that because for example, on the banana, we can't have everything yellow.\n\n0:20:38\tSPEAKER_02\n It will sound like.\n\n0:20:39\tSPEAKER_02\n So.\n\n0:20:40\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not always going to be the same color.\n\n0:20:43\tSPEAKER_03\n It sounds like the color is something that we.\n\n0:20:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:46\tSPEAKER_01\n The colors are yellow and gray.\n\n0:20:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Gray.\n\n0:20:48\tSPEAKER_02\n So it could be gray on the banana one.\n\n0:20:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Could be gray.\n\n0:20:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:53\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, the yellow, yeah.\n\n0:20:54\tSPEAKER_03\n The yellow is ugly though.\n\n0:20:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Depending on that.\n\n0:20:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:57\tSPEAKER_03\n So we have to talk to our executive managers and see if we can get away with just the art.\n\n0:21:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:02\tSPEAKER_00\n I think this is the.\n\n0:21:04\tSPEAKER_00\n The fact that we.\n\n0:21:06\tSPEAKER_00\n We need success.\n\n0:21:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:21:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Perhaps.\n\n0:21:09\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that's how.\n\n0:21:10\tSPEAKER_02\n I think that's great.\n\n0:21:12\tSPEAKER_02\n And it would be that expensive to have a little bit of that.\n\n0:21:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:17\tSPEAKER_03\n The buttons in the middle.\n\n0:21:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:22\tSPEAKER_03\n So do you think that's more of a three then?\n\n0:21:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Four.\n\n0:21:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Four.\n\n0:21:28\tSPEAKER_03\n I think four.\n\n0:21:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, I don't.\n\n0:21:30\tSPEAKER_03\n But we have good reasons for it.\n\n0:21:31\tSPEAKER_03\n So we can still put a.\n\n0:21:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Four.\n\n0:21:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:21:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:21:37\tSPEAKER_03\n And final question.\n\n0:21:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics?\n\n0:21:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Current trends of fruits and veggies desire for sponginess.\n\n0:21:46\tSPEAKER_01\n I would say so.\n\n0:21:48\tSPEAKER_01\n But maybe more like two.\n\n0:21:51\tSPEAKER_01\n There's no like pictures of fruit.\n\n0:21:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Now the plates interchangeable.\n\n0:22:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:02\tSPEAKER_03\n They are.\n\n0:22:03\tSPEAKER_03\n So you can have banana and kiwi and.\n\n0:22:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:22:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:22:07\tSPEAKER_03\n So that's something that's kind of in the making to like maybe I'll become more.\n\n0:22:10\tSPEAKER_01\n That's fashionable in itself.\n\n0:22:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Have interchangeable plates.\n\n0:22:14\tSPEAKER_02\n I think.\n\n0:22:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, what was a three.\n\n0:22:20\tSPEAKER_00\n But I think if somebody saw that and he said what was that inspired from.\n\n0:22:25\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know if you'd instantly say.\n\n0:22:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Mine go.\n\n0:22:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe if it was sent it.\n\n0:22:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:34\tSPEAKER_01\n There we go.\n\n0:22:35\tSPEAKER_01\n That's very.\n\n0:22:36\tSPEAKER_01\n We have money for that.\n\n0:22:37\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:22:38\tSPEAKER_01\n So based on.\n\n0:22:40\tSPEAKER_01\n This evaluation.\n\n0:22:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Do we average the notes?\n\n0:22:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:22:43\tSPEAKER_01\n We do.\n\n0:22:44\tSPEAKER_03\n So what was I going to put for that?\n\n0:22:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Two for a fashion.\n\n0:22:46\tSPEAKER_03\n I would say two.\n\n0:22:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:22:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:22:51\tSPEAKER_03\n So are average there five six eight ten eleven twelve thirteen fifteen nineteen twenty one divided by eleven.\n\n0:23:02\tSPEAKER_01\n One point nine.\n\n0:23:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:05\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know what it's.\n\n0:23:06\tSPEAKER_01\n It's one and two.\n\n0:23:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Between one and two.\n\n0:23:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:23:10\tSPEAKER_00\n That's great.\n\n0:23:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:13\tSPEAKER_03\n That's very good because the highest could have got is one.\n\n0:23:19\tSPEAKER_03\n All right.\n\n0:23:20\tSPEAKER_02\n That's the right time.\n\n0:23:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Because it's the.\n\n0:23:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:23:24\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it should be more around two.\n\n0:23:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:34\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:35\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:36\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:37\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:38\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:46\tSPEAKER_01\n It is one point nine.\n\n0:23:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh.\n\n0:23:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Wow.\n\n0:23:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Wow.\n\n0:23:50\tNone\n Good.\n\n0:23:51\tNone\n All that's at cause.\n\n0:23:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:53\tNone\n All right.\n\n0:23:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Now with that over and done with our next step is to see if we are under budget.\n\n0:24:03\tSPEAKER_01\n And my computer is frozen.\n\n0:24:09\tSPEAKER_01\n And it's not.\n\n0:24:12\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:24:13\tSPEAKER_01\n So in our shared folder, if everyone could go there right now.\n\n0:24:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Sorry.\n\n0:24:21\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm going to.\n\n0:24:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, you're going to do that.\n\n0:24:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Still a cable.\n\n0:24:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:24:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Is that the project?\n\n0:24:26\tSPEAKER_01\n It's.\n\n0:24:27\tSPEAKER_01\n It's.\n\n0:24:28\tSPEAKER_01\n It's an Excel file.\n\n0:24:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh.\n\n0:24:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Protection cost.\n\n0:24:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Protection cost.\n\n0:24:41\tSPEAKER_01\n And I have to access that as well.\n\n0:24:43\tNone\n One moment.\n\n0:24:45\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:24:48\tSPEAKER_01\n So far I've added what I think.\n\n0:24:54\tSPEAKER_01\n What is going on?\n\n0:24:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Great.\n\n0:24:57\tSPEAKER_01\n It's blinking at me.\n\n0:25:00\tSPEAKER_01\n It's locked for editing.\n\n0:25:03\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm going to open up a second one then.\n\n0:25:07\tSPEAKER_01\n It's locked for editing.\n\n0:25:08\tSPEAKER_01\n I have the original in my.\n\n0:25:11\tSPEAKER_01\n But you know what can.\n\n0:25:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Was it locked because I'm in it?\n\n0:25:15\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:25:16\tSPEAKER_00\n It just means that we come out and.\n\n0:25:18\tSPEAKER_00\n More to it now.\n\n0:25:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Have you have you completed it?\n\n0:25:21\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:25:22\tSPEAKER_01\n No, I was hoping that you guys could.\n\n0:25:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:25:26\tSPEAKER_01\n There we go.\n\n0:25:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:25:32\tSPEAKER_01\n So we need to tell you how much I will.\n\n0:25:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Our product will be costing.\n\n0:25:38\tSPEAKER_01\n So you can look up at the screen.\n\n0:25:42\tSPEAKER_01\n The large screen.\n\n0:25:43\tSPEAKER_01\n I guess looking at your own two and telling you which one you think.\n\n0:25:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, we're using.\n\n0:25:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Kinetic, which is quite.\n\n0:25:50\tSPEAKER_01\n A large expense of three years.\n\n0:25:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:53\tSPEAKER_01\n We're using a regular chip.\n\n0:25:55\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:56\tSPEAKER_01\n It's.\n\n0:25:58\tSPEAKER_01\n It's double.\n\n0:25:59\tSPEAKER_01\n It's double.\n\n0:26:00\tSPEAKER_01\n We're using plastic and rubber.\n\n0:26:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:04\tSPEAKER_01\n So.\n\n0:26:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Good thing the plastic is free.\n\n0:26:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Eight.\n\n0:26:08\tSPEAKER_01\n What does that mean?\n\n0:26:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:11\tSPEAKER_01\n I guess we should do it just for one kind.\n\n0:26:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:16\tSPEAKER_02\n So it's like special color.\n\n0:26:17\tSPEAKER_02\n We'll have two colors.\n\n0:26:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Right?\n\n0:26:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, one color for the case.\n\n0:26:21\tSPEAKER_01\n One color for the buttons.\n\n0:26:23\tSPEAKER_01\n So we can.\n\n0:26:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:25\tSPEAKER_01\n We have push button interface.\n\n0:26:31\tSPEAKER_01\n That's inexpensive.\n\n0:26:33\tSPEAKER_01\n And we have a special color for the button.\n\n0:26:38\tSPEAKER_01\n And we also have a special form.\n\n0:26:42\tSPEAKER_01\n And special material.\n\n0:26:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Which puts us just barely on the budget.\n\n0:26:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Congratulations.\n\n0:26:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Great guys.\n\n0:26:56\tSPEAKER_01\n So, um, our operating cost is 1220 euros.\n\n0:27:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Awesome.\n\n0:27:12\tSPEAKER_01\n And back to our PowerPoint.\n\n0:27:15\tSPEAKER_01\n So.\n\n0:27:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:27:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, we are.\n\n0:27:24\tSPEAKER_01\n So we need to do a project evaluation again, which is probably, um, I don't know, a different extension of the.\n\n0:27:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Of the actual project driving in the product.\n\n0:27:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Hmm.\n\n0:27:41\tSPEAKER_00\n The project.\n\n0:27:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:47\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:27:48\tSPEAKER_01\n So, um, do you guys feel like there was real creativity?\n\n0:27:55\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we were pushed.\n\n0:27:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Pushed for creativity.\n\n0:27:58\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, we went.\n\n0:27:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Really given.\n\n0:28:00\tSPEAKER_00\n I.\n\n0:28:01\tSPEAKER_00\n All the tears.\n\n0:28:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:03\tSPEAKER_00\n To go about odd nine tasks.\n\n0:28:07\tSPEAKER_00\n So I think we could have done a bit more time.\n\n0:28:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:28:13\tSPEAKER_01\n So it would be like.\n\n0:28:15\tSPEAKER_01\n More time.\n\n0:28:17\tSPEAKER_01\n The.\n\n0:28:18\tSPEAKER_01\n The.\n\n0:28:19\tSPEAKER_01\n The.\n\n0:28:20\tSPEAKER_01\n The.\n\n0:28:21\tSPEAKER_01\n The.\n\n0:28:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:23\tSPEAKER_01\n But you were allowed.\n\n0:28:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Creativity.\n\n0:28:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:26\tSPEAKER_03\n I think so.\n\n0:28:27\tSPEAKER_03\n But you were supposed to.\n\n0:28:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Conceptual and functional.\n\n0:28:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Like we were very creative in coming up with an idea.\n\n0:28:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:34\tSPEAKER_00\n But we just limited by resources.\n\n0:28:36\tSPEAKER_00\n If we had decided to use the LTE.\n\n0:28:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Or anything.\n\n0:28:41\tSPEAKER_00\n So that's why.\n\n0:28:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Yoda ship.\n\n0:29:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Good leadership right there we stay on task.\n\n0:29:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:05\tSPEAKER_00\n as soon as we've come out with what we intended, a product within the budget. I think that's fine as the beach ship. I'm also a personal coach, helped along the way. And the timing was good.\n\n0:29:18\tSPEAKER_03\n We never were pushed for time or sat around doing nothing. Yeah. Yeah.\n\n0:29:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Special Coke.\n\n0:29:25\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm so very grateful. I think I'm grateful.\n\n0:29:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah. Yeah.\n\n0:29:29\tSPEAKER_03\n It's good to work. I think we are well suited to our rules. Yeah. Yeah.\n\n0:29:41\tSPEAKER_01\n All right, how are our means?\n\n0:29:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Um, we needed more play-doh colors. Yeah. And whole play-doh because that was all the\n\n0:29:51\tSPEAKER_00\n red we had. So if we wanted to make a bigger, it wouldn't have been able to. Okay.\n\n0:30:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Satisfactory? Is that the computer programs are good? Yeah, it could be really straightforward.\n\n0:30:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah. I think it was the only thing was having to remember to, you know, take the okay,\n\n0:30:13\tSPEAKER_02\n the thing I was the only one who struggled with that. I'm actually not sure if I could stay with\n\n0:30:24\tSPEAKER_03\n the English language. Yeah. I'll probably still be there. Yeah.\n\n0:30:26\tSPEAKER_01\n New ideas found. I don't really know what that means.\n\n0:30:32\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we've all learned to step on each other. Yeah. Um, yeah. Yeah. About each different. That's the good new idea.\n\n0:30:44\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not sure. New ideas found.\n\n0:30:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah. Well, I guess we really, we bounced off of each other, which was cool. Yeah.\n\n0:30:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and yeah.\n\n0:31:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We were able to modify each other's ideas. Yeah.\n\n0:31:09\tSPEAKER_02\n To fit in with our AI, to be able to do. Yeah.\n\n0:31:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, does it have smart materials, by the way? Sorry? Does it have smart materials?\n\n0:31:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.\n\n0:31:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, did it come in there? I don't know if we counted that in the past.\n\n0:31:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:31:32\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:31:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, that achieved our last slide is our closing slide.\n\n0:31:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, our costs are within budget. Yeah.\n\n0:31:45\tSPEAKER_01\n It's evaluated generally positively. Yeah.\n\n0:31:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Mm-hmm. And, um, don't forget to complete final question there.\n\n0:31:52\tSPEAKER_01\n In meeting summary, then we celebrate. That's it. Such a way that I have no idea.\n\n0:31:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay. Brilliant. All right. Thank you very much. Okay. Bye.\n\n0:32:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay. Thank you.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "The agenda for the meeting is who will have the prototype presentation by their two designers and evaluate it, given the criteria that they gave it, and talk about the finances.
