first kick off meeting about this new project.\n\n0:00:52\tSPEAKER_01\n We're going to talk about in a few minutes.\n\n0:00:55\tSPEAKER_01\n So I would be Sebastian, the project manager.\n\n0:01:01\tSPEAKER_01\n You are...\n\n0:01:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Michael, I'm the user interface designer.\n\n0:01:07\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm Giger Mardarigia, I'm the marketing expert.\n\n0:01:10\tSPEAKER_03\n And I'm Haymond, the industrial designer.\n\n0:01:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Ok, very good.\n\n0:01:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Thanks for being here.\n\n0:01:17\tSPEAKER_01\n So let's have a look to the agenda.\n\n0:01:21\tSPEAKER_01\n So we are going to go through this agenda and mainly first to make...\n\n0:01:29\tSPEAKER_01\n to be used to the tools available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here.\n\n0:01:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Then we'll go to the plan of the project and have general discussions about it.\n\n0:01:43\tSPEAKER_01\n So the goal of this project is to develop a new remote control.\n\n0:01:52\tSPEAKER_01\n It should be original, trendy, and also user friendly.\n\n0:02:01\tSPEAKER_01\n As usual, we will follow the project method that we are using in our company.\n\n0:02:12\tSPEAKER_01\n It is in three steps, as you know.\n\n0:02:14\tSPEAKER_01\n First, the functional design, the second, the conceptual design, and then the detailed design.\n\n0:02:21\tSPEAKER_01\n During each step of each design, you will work separately individually on your specific tasks.\n\n0:02:33\tSPEAKER_01\n And we will meet to discuss and take decisions about what you did and what we will do next.\n\n0:02:45\tSPEAKER_01\n So first, we have to train ourselves with all the tools available in this nice meeting room and particularly the whiteboard.\n\n0:02:58\tSPEAKER_01\n So we are going to go through the whiteboard and take some notes or do some drawings.\n\n0:03:06\tSPEAKER_01\n So we want to start.\n\n0:03:10\tSPEAKER_00\n I will explain this one.\n\n0:03:15\tSPEAKER_00\n I want to draw my favourite animal.\n\n0:03:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's see.\n\n0:03:28\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't really have a favourite animal, but I think I have one in mind.\n\n0:03:42\tSPEAKER_00\n I will tell you about the spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a whiteboard.\n\n0:03:54\tSPEAKER_00\n The spider lives in a web.\n\n0:04:01\tSPEAKER_00\n It has eight legs.\n\n0:04:08\tSPEAKER_00\n It can move all about the web in two dimensions.\n\n0:04:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Unless it is a three-dimensional web, which sometimes there are some spiders that live in a big ball of a web.\n\n0:04:23\tSPEAKER_00\n The other thing is that some spiders can fly.\n\n0:04:30\tSPEAKER_00\n They have a web-building material, but it acts like a parachute so they can go and find new web somewhere else.\n\n0:04:41\tSPEAKER_00\n I think they did this in the Charlotte's web, that movie, that was actually a book first, but at the end all the spiders flew away.\n\n0:04:51\tSPEAKER_01\n That's my animal.\n\n0:04:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Guillermo, do you want to?\n\n0:05:05\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know why, but when I was a child I wanted to be a panther.\n\n0:05:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Not a pink panther, but it's very difficult to draw a panther.\n\n0:05:18\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a bit I don't like it.\n\n0:05:37\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a friendly panther.\n\n0:05:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe it's happy because it just ate someone.\n\n0:05:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Actually, honestly, I don't know what's his behavior.\n\n0:06:00\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know if it's the male who hands or it's the female.\n\n0:06:07\tSPEAKER_02\n I think I've watched that lion didn't hunt, it's the female lion who hands.\n\n0:06:16\tSPEAKER_02\n I like it because it's fast and it's black as well, so it can hide itself very easily.\n\n0:06:29\tSPEAKER_02\n It looks like powerful, strong.\n\n0:06:40\tSPEAKER_02\n I watched a film about a black panther when I was a child.\n\n0:06:46\tSPEAKER_02\n I was in that age when everything was choking me a lot.\n\n0:06:52\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't like pink panther.\n\n0:07:06\tSPEAKER_02\n I like it.\n\n0:07:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Is it help?\n\n0:07:29\tSPEAKER_03\n This lapel is coming out once in a while.\n\n0:07:32\tSPEAKER_03\n That's not very strong.\n\n0:07:40\tSPEAKER_03\n It's not the favorite animal, but I think I'll draw elephant.\n\n0:07:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, thanks.\n\n0:07:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Elephant goes like this and it's a zoom.\n\n0:08:04\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know whether there should be any distance or not, but I think this is the easiest.\n\n0:08:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Then we have it strong.\n\n0:08:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Something like this.\n\n0:08:23\tSPEAKER_03\n I cute.\n\n0:08:27\tSPEAKER_03\n It's not so strong.\n\n0:08:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Sometimes they have a hump.\n\n0:08:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Elephants are friendly and they have a different way of walking.\n\n0:08:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Wherever they are going to put their first feet, the second feet will always be.\n\n0:08:52\tSPEAKER_03\n The third feet will be there.\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_03\n That's very peculiar about them.\n\n0:09:01\tSPEAKER_03\n They are very useful to human beings.\n\n0:09:04\tSPEAKER_03\n At least a few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportation or something.\n\n0:09:10\tSPEAKER_03\n When they had to carry huge loads from one place to another, elephants were very useful.\n\n0:09:16\tSPEAKER_03\n They are found in the warm countries.\n\n0:09:22\tSPEAKER_03\n They are the biggest terrestrial animals.\n\n0:09:26\tSPEAKER_03\n That's what I know about them.\n\n0:09:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Is this an Indian or an African elephant?\n\n0:09:33\tSPEAKER_03\n There are two kinds of different Indian and African elephants.\n\n0:09:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Indian elephants have one bump and the African have two.\n\n0:09:43\tSPEAKER_03\n There is a difference in the trunk of the animals.\n\n0:09:46\tSPEAKER_03\n These elephants are Indian.\n\n0:09:49\tSPEAKER_03\n For some elephants, the trunk is having one.\n\n0:09:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Do we have some message there?\n\n0:09:58\tSPEAKER_01\n We have to cut you.\n\n0:10:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Thank you.\n\n0:10:04\tSPEAKER_01\n We will discuss that offline.\n\n0:10:07\tSPEAKER_01\n We will do another meeting of the elephants.\n\n0:10:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Another important part of the project is about money and about finance.\n\n0:10:23\tSPEAKER_01\n We should target a price of 25 euros for this remote control.\n\n0:10:29\tSPEAKER_01\n We should generate a profit of 50 million euros.\n\n0:10:38\tSPEAKER_01\n We should target an international market.\n\n0:10:42\tSPEAKER_00\n One question.\n\n0:10:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Is this a standalone unit that we are going to be selling?\n\n0:10:49\tSPEAKER_00\n You already have a TV but you are buying an extra remote control for something.\n\n0:10:53\tSPEAKER_01\n This is the next topic we have to discuss.\n\n0:10:57\tSPEAKER_01\n We should decide which kind of remote control we want to go.\n\n0:11:05\tSPEAKER_01\n We should be specific remote control to some specific device.\n\n0:11:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Should be a universal one and an extra.\n\n0:11:17\tSPEAKER_01\n I am waiting for your inputs very quickly because we have only three minutes to go.\n\n0:11:26\tSPEAKER_00\n It seems that the first thing that they have specified is the price based on how much profit we want to make.\n\n0:11:36\tSPEAKER_00\n It seems to be a little strange if we do not know what the product is.\n\n0:11:41\tSPEAKER_00\n If that is the requirement that we need to design the product to actually fit that price bracket.\n\n0:11:50\tSPEAKER_00\n We need to find out what people are willing to pay for.\n\n0:11:56\tSPEAKER_00\n What kind of product they are expecting for 25 euros.\n\n0:11:59\tSPEAKER_00\n It seems quite a lot for remote control.\n\n0:12:01\tSPEAKER_01\n I think this is more a job to our market person.\n\n0:12:05\tSPEAKER_01\n It should be the topic of the next meeting.\n\n0:12:09\tSPEAKER_01\n We have another view of this.\n\n0:12:13\tSPEAKER_01\n We need to close the meeting.\n\n0:12:16\tSPEAKER_01\n We will have a new meeting soon.\n\n0:12:20\tSPEAKER_01\n We have to work on the working design.\n\n0:12:28\tSPEAKER_01\n We have to work on the technical functions.\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_01\n We have to work on user requirements.\n\n0:12:38\tSPEAKER_01\n You will receive some information by mail as usual.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Thanks for coming today.\n\n0:13:13\tNone\n Thank you for watching.\n\n", "summary":
