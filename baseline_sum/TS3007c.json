have little problems with my laptop.\n\n0:00:12\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:00:14\tSPEAKER_04\n So I had a little less time to complete.\n\n0:00:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:00:20\tSPEAKER_04\n A little problem.\n\n0:00:24\tSPEAKER_04\n A little problem.\n\n0:00:28\tSPEAKER_04\n A little problem.\n\n0:00:32\tSPEAKER_04\n A little problem.\n\n0:00:34\tSPEAKER_01\n A little problem.\n\n0:00:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Project Manager.\n\n0:00:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:00:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:00:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Your project manager.\n\n0:00:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Welcome to the conceptual design meeting for real reaction.\n\n0:00:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Hello again.\n\n0:00:58\tSPEAKER_03\n It's the same as the last time.\n\n0:01:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Also this time there will be three presentations.\n\n0:01:06\tSPEAKER_03\n And we must reach a decision on the remote control concepts.\n\n0:01:14\tSPEAKER_03\n At the end, when I finish it off, I have some info from a more class I visited.\n\n0:01:24\tSPEAKER_03\n I have some information.\n\n0:01:28\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm doing a lot.\n\n0:01:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Mostly.\n\n0:01:34\tSPEAKER_03\n I used to master.\n\n0:01:36\tSPEAKER_03\n The concepts on where we must reach a decision on are from RF2 sorts.\n\n0:01:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Component concepts and user interface concepts.\n\n0:01:48\tSPEAKER_03\n The first one is really about the total package.\n\n0:01:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, we have decided to do the touch screen.\n\n0:01:58\tSPEAKER_03\n But it must be a case around it.\n\n0:02:00\tSPEAKER_03\n So it won't be as breakable.\n\n0:02:04\tSPEAKER_03\n How about the energy?\n\n0:02:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Can you reload it?\n\n0:02:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Or just berries which you must exchange?\n\n0:02:10\tSPEAKER_03\n The user interface concept with the type and the supplements where to put word button.\n\n0:02:17\tSPEAKER_03\n And I would say, yes, can you begin?\n\n0:02:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Sure.\n\n0:02:25\tSPEAKER_03\n At the end, I will take notes.\n\n0:02:27\tSPEAKER_03\n At the end, the minute will be at the share pool.\n\n0:02:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Let me see.\n\n0:02:35\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's this one.\n\n0:02:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Right.\n\n0:02:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, I'll be talking about components.\n\n0:02:53\tSPEAKER_00\n What I did was I reviewed previously used items by two different age groups.\n\n0:03:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Below 45 and above.\n\n0:03:03\tSPEAKER_00\n And I just watched what the differences are.\n\n0:03:07\tSPEAKER_00\n I checked what we want and how can we aim at the target group.\n\n0:03:15\tSPEAKER_00\n What I found was that senior citizens.\n\n0:03:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Sorry.\n\n0:03:25\tSPEAKER_00\n It's okay.\n\n0:03:27\tSPEAKER_00\n They like the traditional materials like wood and such more.\n\n0:03:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Wood and chrome.\n\n0:03:38\tSPEAKER_00\n They like luxurious styles.\n\n0:03:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Whereas the young and dynamic.\n\n0:03:44\tSPEAKER_00\n They like more soft materials.\n\n0:03:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Finger of the teletabits, for instance.\n\n0:03:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Soft and fluffy and colorful.\n\n0:03:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, the shapes are curved and round.\n\n0:03:54\tSPEAKER_00\n You get them at the picture.\n\n0:03:56\tSPEAKER_00\n And they like sports and gaming.\n\n0:03:58\tSPEAKER_00\n And it gives them the vitality.\n\n0:04:02\tSPEAKER_03\n So, one little question about the material.\n\n0:04:08\tSPEAKER_03\n A soft material for a remote control.\n\n0:04:10\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll get to that.\n\n0:04:12\tSPEAKER_00\n You'll see.\n\n0:04:14\tSPEAKER_00\n First off, let's start with the energy.\n\n0:04:16\tSPEAKER_00\n I had a choice between a few different sources.\n\n0:04:20\tSPEAKER_00\n But the two basic sources that I found were the best possible with a battery versus kinetic.\n\n0:04:27\tSPEAKER_00\n When you move something, it gets energy.\n\n0:04:31\tSPEAKER_00\n I figured, well, that's kind of high-tech.\n\n0:04:34\tSPEAKER_00\n When you have a remote control, when you pick it up, it has power.\n\n0:04:38\tSPEAKER_00\n That would be actually very nice.\n\n0:04:40\tSPEAKER_00\n I figured, but we could also use a battery that's better.\n\n0:04:44\tSPEAKER_01\n When the power gets low, you have to shake it or something.\n\n0:04:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, you just have to shake it around.\n\n0:04:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Then it has some more energy.\n\n0:04:53\tSPEAKER_00\n So, you could just go for a battery or you could go for both.\n\n0:04:57\tSPEAKER_04\n Have you considered the option of using the solar panel?\n\n0:04:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I actually did.\n\n0:05:01\tSPEAKER_00\n But the thing is about solar panels.\n\n0:05:03\tSPEAKER_00\n You have to have light.\n\n0:05:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Some light preferably.\n\n0:05:09\tSPEAKER_00\n You could use normal light, but you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something.\n\n0:05:16\tSPEAKER_00\n So, ultimate use of a solar panel.\n\n0:05:23\tSPEAKER_00\n You could use solar panels.\n\n0:05:25\tSPEAKER_00\n But you have to implement them into the remote control, leaving you a bit less space for the interface.\n\n0:05:34\tSPEAKER_00\n So, what's actually, I figured that, well, seeing that you'll always be within the distance of TV.\n\n0:05:43\tSPEAKER_00\n From the TV, there comes a whole bunch of light.\n\n0:05:46\tSPEAKER_00\n So, it would actually power itself from the TV, but you would just take up all the space and you wouldn't have the full amount of power actually used.\n\n0:05:56\tSPEAKER_00\n So, prefer a kinetic?\n\n0:05:57\tSPEAKER_00\n I prefer a kinetic, because it's, well, the costs aren't that much higher.\n\n0:06:02\tSPEAKER_00\n And it's just a bit more high-tech than a normal battery.\n\n0:06:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, if you don't move a remote control.\n\n0:06:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, you pick it up and you press buttons and...\n\n0:06:13\tSPEAKER_03\n That's enough to keep the energy level...\n\n0:06:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, well, actually it is.\n\n0:06:18\tSPEAKER_00\n And if it isn't, you just shake it a bit.\n\n0:06:21\tSPEAKER_00\n And it would power up again.\n\n0:06:23\tSPEAKER_00\n But like I said, you could use a battery that you just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves.\n\n0:06:27\tSPEAKER_00\n And for rest, you just use all the battery.\n\n0:06:30\tSPEAKER_01\n And when the battery doesn't work, I usually shake it too.\n\n0:06:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Exactly. Exactly. Thank you, Tim.\n\n0:06:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Furthermore, we checked the cases.\n\n0:06:45\tSPEAKER_00\n We have different options concerning the cases here.\n\n0:06:49\tSPEAKER_00\n You simply add a basic standard model.\n\n0:06:53\tSPEAKER_00\n It was kind of square and I figured that was a bit boring.\n\n0:06:57\tSPEAKER_00\n So, you could go for the single curve or the double curve.\n\n0:07:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Single curve, it's just a nice curve.\n\n0:07:06\tSPEAKER_00\n But you could go in a double curve.\n\n0:07:09\tSPEAKER_00\n And that's several different dimensions.\n\n0:07:11\tSPEAKER_00\n That gives you a whole new...\n\n0:07:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Dynamic loop.\n\n0:07:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, that gives you a younger and more high-tech look, I figured.\n\n0:07:18\tSPEAKER_00\n But we'll discuss later.\n\n0:07:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Are you going to draw it?\n\n0:07:24\tSPEAKER_00\n What?\n\n0:07:25\tSPEAKER_00\n One meter draw.\n\n0:07:26\tSPEAKER_00\n In 3D.\n\n0:07:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:28\tSPEAKER_00\n I can't imagine.\n\n0:07:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I could show you.\n\n0:07:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, let's say you...\n\n0:07:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's say that's your standard design.\n\n0:07:50\tSPEAKER_00\n That's a bit your standard design.\n\n0:07:52\tSPEAKER_00\n But you could actually go like something like this.\n\n0:07:57\tSPEAKER_00\n And then in 3D effect you could go.\n\n0:08:06\tSPEAKER_00\n So, you just...\n\n0:08:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, this is a bit difficult to even.\n\n0:08:11\tSPEAKER_00\n I didn't take a major in art.\n\n0:08:14\tSPEAKER_00\n But you could have a whole new, the back.\n\n0:08:17\tSPEAKER_00\n The depth you could just play around a bit.\n\n0:08:20\tSPEAKER_00\n You don't have to use standard...\n\n0:08:23\tSPEAKER_03\n A little artistic.\n\n0:08:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, you could at least move space for creativity.\n\n0:08:28\tSPEAKER_00\n It might be an idea, but...\n\n0:08:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, for the more...\n\n0:08:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, plastic versus rubber, we could choose what's better, plastic or rubber.\n\n0:08:38\tSPEAKER_00\n I prefer rubber because it feels...\n\n0:08:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it's soft.\n\n0:08:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it's soft and...\n\n0:08:44\tSPEAKER_00\n I like soft people.\n\n0:08:46\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, plastic also has that cheap feeling to it.\n\n0:08:51\tSPEAKER_00\n I usually associate plastic with something as cheap.\n\n0:08:56\tSPEAKER_00\n That's maybe just me.\n\n0:08:58\tSPEAKER_00\n We could talk about it later.\n\n0:09:03\tSPEAKER_00\n For the more buttons, traditional or touch screen, well, we discussed it in a previous meeting.\n\n0:09:10\tSPEAKER_00\n So, I figured, just leave it at LCD.\n\n0:09:14\tSPEAKER_00\n And chipset.\n\n0:09:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, if we are going to use traditional buttons, we could go with a simple chipset.\n\n0:09:21\tSPEAKER_00\n But if we decide to go on an LCD screen, we would use an advanced chipset and that would bring the necessary cost source with it.\n\n0:09:33\tSPEAKER_00\n So, that's something we have to keep in mind.\n\n0:09:35\tSPEAKER_00\n If it isn't a manageable budget wife, we'd have to go off to simple buttons.\n\n0:09:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I think we're going to sell 10 millions of them.\n\n0:09:46\tSPEAKER_01\n So, I bet a big company in Korea or Taiwan, like Samsung, engavers a big discount on the chipset.\n\n0:09:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, probably.\n\n0:09:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Usually chips are more expensive than one dollar.\n\n0:10:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, probably, but so.\n\n0:10:05\tSPEAKER_00\n But, yeah, that shouldn't be a real issue.\n\n0:10:07\tSPEAKER_00\n That shouldn't be that big issue.\n\n0:10:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, I just had a...\n\n0:10:11\tSPEAKER_00\n I put in big summaries, we could discuss it a bit.\n\n0:10:14\tSPEAKER_00\n What are your ideas when concerning battery versus kinetic?\n\n0:10:20\tSPEAKER_04\n I think you should use kinetic as a backup.\n\n0:10:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, combination.\n\n0:10:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Combination, right?\n\n0:10:26\tSPEAKER_00\n You used battery and charged it up with kinetic.\n\n0:10:29\tSPEAKER_00\n When you pick it up, it charges up.\n\n0:10:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Like an acu.\n\n0:10:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Acu.\n\n0:10:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:10:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Just like the wire from Saika.\n\n0:10:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n0:10:40\tSPEAKER_00\n What do you think?\n\n0:10:41\tSPEAKER_03\n I prefer both to combine them.\n\n0:10:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, okay.\n\n0:10:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, that would bring some more cash, but I mean...\n\n0:10:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Who cares, right?\n\n0:10:55\tSPEAKER_00\n That's the project manager's problem.\n\n0:10:58\tSPEAKER_04\n Of course, battery in.\n\n0:11:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:01\tSPEAKER_00\n 50 cents.\n\n0:11:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, and then we have single-curve versus double-curve.\n\n0:11:07\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, maybe I have something in my presentation to...\n\n0:11:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Good, but then.\n\n0:11:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, now we'll just wait and...\n\n0:11:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Plastic versus rubber?\n\n0:11:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Rubber.\n\n0:11:17\tSPEAKER_04\n Rubber, isn't it possible to make combination what kind of rubber?\n\n0:11:21\tSPEAKER_04\n It's all bendable, we move, so you've got to sit there around.\n\n0:11:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, I figured it would be rather hard.\n\n0:11:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Rubber, this is an occasion, yeah.\n\n0:11:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Rubber casing, because if you use a touch screen, it's just the casing around it, so you could go for plastic, but I figured...\n\n0:11:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:41\tSPEAKER_00\n I would choose rubber.\n\n0:11:43\tSPEAKER_04\n Maybe I can ask it right now, the question that I have, is it possible if it's necessary to make a touch screen square?\n\n0:11:50\tSPEAKER_04\n It is, and I think, yeah.\n\n0:11:52\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:11:54\tSPEAKER_01\n I think that the touch screens are generally square, but it's the case you put around it that makes a shape.\n\n0:12:00\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, maybe we can do it.\n\n0:12:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, but if you have a square LCD screen, you put a case around it that has like bulbs or...\n\n0:12:11\tSPEAKER_01\n That covers part of the LCD screen.\n\n0:12:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, that would solve custom-isable.\n\n0:12:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, I get it.\n\n0:12:19\tSPEAKER_00\n So, one of the opinions, rubber or plastic, I prefer rubber.\n\n0:12:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Me too.\n\n0:12:26\tSPEAKER_00\n You too?\n\n0:12:27\tSPEAKER_00\n You sure?\n\n0:12:28\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, it has a bit.\n\n0:12:30\tSPEAKER_04\n As long as it's firm, and you don't...\n\n0:12:32\tSPEAKER_04\n It's not bendable or something, I think that goes too far.\n\n0:12:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it shouldn't flop over when you hold it.\n\n0:12:39\tSPEAKER_00\n No, that's...\n\n0:12:41\tSPEAKER_00\n That's the chipset that will hold it firm in place, and an LCD screen will...\n\n0:12:47\tSPEAKER_04\n Might even bounce back when you drop it.\n\n0:12:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it might.\n\n0:12:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Traditional versus LCD wire figured we're all set on that.\n\n0:12:57\tSPEAKER_00\n And then also the simple versus advanced.\n\n0:13:00\tSPEAKER_00\n I figure if we go for LCD, we should have the advanced.\n\n0:13:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:05\tSPEAKER_00\n So that shouldn't be a problem.\n\n0:13:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, well, that's my...\n\n0:13:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Thank you.\n\n0:13:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Welcome.\n\n0:13:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Can I do anything?\n\n0:13:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, do your thing.\n\n0:13:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:13:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Bringing it on.\n\n0:13:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Expert map.\n\n0:13:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, last week...\n\n0:13:28\tSPEAKER_01\n I went to Paris and Milan, a professional trans-watching, from marketing, our research and development department, and I, went to Paris and Milan.\n\n0:13:46\tSPEAKER_01\n In Paris and Milan, we asked different people, differing in age and in income, the amount of money to spend.\n\n0:13:57\tSPEAKER_01\n What they like in design and material nowadays.\n\n0:14:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Findings.\n\n0:14:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Our main audience, so that's people below 40, prefer the following.\n\n0:14:14\tSPEAKER_01\n At first, the colors of fruit, very basic colors like Janus explained.\n\n0:14:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Fresh colors, green, red, strawberry, red, yellow, banana, yellow.\n\n0:14:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Considering material, yeah, they like spongy material, like spongy, like a soft material.\n\n0:14:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Janus mentioned it also.\n\n0:14:48\tSPEAKER_01\n I think he did some findings himself.\n\n0:14:52\tSPEAKER_01\n You were in Paris.\n\n0:14:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Like this.\n\n0:14:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Like big, flashy colors, fresh.\n\n0:15:02\tSPEAKER_01\n It's nice, I think.\n\n0:15:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, our secondary audience, people above 40, 40 years in age, they like the dark, traditional colors.\n\n0:15:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, materials like wood.\n\n0:15:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, wood is not a material you build every mocton trollar.\n\n0:15:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, you could.\n\n0:15:25\tSPEAKER_01\n No, you could.\n\n0:15:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but just a wood and a cake.\n\n0:15:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:15:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Like you have those fake panels on the floor, but that isn't wood anyway.\n\n0:15:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:15:41\tSPEAKER_01\n But that's our secondary audience.\n\n0:15:45\tSPEAKER_01\n We decided to take, yeah, the people below 40.\n\n0:15:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:52\tSPEAKER_01\n This doesn't apply.\n\n0:15:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, the third.\n\n0:15:55\tSPEAKER_01\n There are some overall thoughts about new remote controls.\n\n0:15:58\tSPEAKER_01\n They have to look fancy.\n\n0:16:02\tSPEAKER_01\n They should be technological, innovative.\n\n0:16:06\tSPEAKER_01\n They should be fancy things in.\n\n0:16:10\tSPEAKER_01\n And easy to use.\n\n0:16:12\tSPEAKER_01\n But that's common.\n\n0:16:15\tSPEAKER_01\n My personal preferences.\n\n0:16:18\tSPEAKER_01\n We have to aim at our main audience and therefore use fresh colors.\n\n0:16:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Would you prefer, did you choose the color of your remote control?\n\n0:16:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, I'll come to that in a second moment.\n\n0:16:32\tSPEAKER_01\n I think about removable covers as he mobile telephone market to customize your own remote control.\n\n0:16:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Like the Nokia, the removable covers just put a red on it and go to shop and buy green one.\n\n0:16:46\tSPEAKER_01\n A third.\n\n0:16:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Material being used could well be stuff like rubber.\n\n0:16:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Do advantages.\n\n0:16:55\tSPEAKER_01\n It fits within the current market trends and it adds safety to your remote when you drop it.\n\n0:17:04\tSPEAKER_01\n So to come back to your question, I think, and the people in Milan and Paris also think that the rubber should be pretty hard, like seen on regular mobile phones.\n\n0:17:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Actually, they have a lot in common,\n\n0:17:22\tSPEAKER_00\n phones and... Well, I actually saw a phone that could use this remote.\n\n0:17:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, maybe you could use your remote at the phone.\n\n0:17:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Hey!\n\n0:17:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Let me make the next step.\n\n0:17:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n0:17:33\tSPEAKER_01\n And my second sheet of personal preferences.\n\n0:17:37\tSPEAKER_01\n We have to reconsider the speech function recognition.\n\n0:17:42\tSPEAKER_01\n It's very innovative.\n\n0:17:45\tSPEAKER_01\n So that you say,\n\n0:17:46\tSPEAKER_02\n SPSS, and it goes to...\n\n0:17:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, like something.\n\n0:17:49\tSPEAKER_01\n You can see that a market is just screaming for new technologies like speech recognition and stuff, but we have to keep the costs in mind.\n\n0:17:59\tSPEAKER_01\n About 50 years.\n\n0:18:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it can be very expensive.\n\n0:18:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, second, building games like Snake or Tetris.\n\n0:18:08\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm using the younger users.\n\n0:18:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Also, the link with mobile phones.\n\n0:18:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but you don't use that games when you're watching television.\n\n0:18:18\tSPEAKER_03\n No, but...\n\n0:18:19\tSPEAKER_01\n No, okay.\n\n0:18:20\tSPEAKER_01\n But you don't use games when you're making a telephone call.\n\n0:18:23\tSPEAKER_01\n It's just the same.\n\n0:18:24\tSPEAKER_04\n When your parents are watching some boring program, you can take a remote and do something else.\n\n0:18:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:18:31\tSPEAKER_01\n When you're at college.\n\n0:18:33\tSPEAKER_00\n You take your remote to a school.\n\n0:18:35\tSPEAKER_01\n You also take...\n\n0:18:37\tSPEAKER_01\n You take your iPad and go play games.\n\n0:18:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, I do that.\n\n0:18:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, and...\n\n0:18:46\tSPEAKER_01\n At third, I stick with it.\n\n0:18:49\tSPEAKER_01\n The login functionality.\n\n0:18:51\tSPEAKER_01\n With the slogan, take parents to control through a new dimension.\n\n0:18:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Very nice.\n\n0:18:58\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, so...\n\n0:19:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, great, really.\n\n0:19:21\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:19:33\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:19:35\tSPEAKER_04\n You interface contents.\n\n0:19:38\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, it's just simple PowerPoint markup.\n\n0:19:41\tSPEAKER_04\n I want to make it more dynamic for you so I'll do it there.\n\n0:19:44\tSPEAKER_04\n But the main concept is...\n\n0:19:47\tSPEAKER_04\n Take one big touch screen.\n\n0:19:52\tSPEAKER_04\n Always display the primary buttons, clear and visible.\n\n0:19:56\tSPEAKER_04\n Maybe even like this with uses of a lot of space.\n\n0:20:01\tSPEAKER_04\n And make the menu structure changeables.\n\n0:20:04\tSPEAKER_04\n Where if you press system...\n\n0:20:07\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, multiple system options can maybe five or ten or one can fit in.\n\n0:20:13\tSPEAKER_04\n Or maybe even a step further when you want to...\n\n0:20:18\tSPEAKER_04\n Have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button.\n\n0:20:24\tSPEAKER_04\n And other buttons can maybe display it here if that's necessary.\n\n0:20:29\tSPEAKER_04\n And well, how do we want to look?\n\n0:20:33\tSPEAKER_04\n That's a remote look.\n\n0:20:36\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, you've got to hold it in one hand.\n\n0:20:39\tSPEAKER_04\n So the middle like all remotes have to be a little bit small.\n\n0:20:44\tSPEAKER_04\n So you can put it inside your hands.\n\n0:20:50\tSPEAKER_04\n And some remotes you can use with a thumb.\n\n0:20:52\tSPEAKER_04\n But I think that's too difficult for this one.\n\n0:20:55\tSPEAKER_04\n So you can make it a little broader here and here.\n\n0:21:00\tSPEAKER_04\n And maybe use your thumb on the main buttons.\n\n0:21:05\tSPEAKER_04\n And use your other hands on the menu structure.\n\n0:21:08\tSPEAKER_04\n So here are going to be the program buttons, one, two, three, four, etc.\n\n0:21:13\tSPEAKER_04\n And the volume control and program control maybe.\n\n0:21:18\tSPEAKER_04\n And down here...\n\n0:21:23\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, yeah, this could be one big LCD menu structure.\n\n0:21:29\tSPEAKER_04\n So you can use it in this way.\n\n0:21:32\tSPEAKER_04\n One thing you've got to keep in mind, keep the remote clear of too much function at the same time.\n\n0:21:45\tSPEAKER_04\n Know that if you are changing the menu structure here, and well, I still believe you should keep displaying the buttons.\n\n0:21:54\tSPEAKER_04\n But if you're programming the caller of the TV, do not display 20 other options that are possible.\n\n0:22:00\tSPEAKER_04\n Keep it as simple as possible.\n\n0:22:03\tSPEAKER_04\n And do not use too many levels.\n\n0:22:05\tSPEAKER_04\n Do not have to select screen first and then brightness and then caller and on plus and on push plus 20 times.\n\n0:22:12\tSPEAKER_04\n But just need just in one button if possible.\n\n0:22:17\tSPEAKER_04\n And well, in all known TV levels channel one, two.\n\n0:22:22\tSPEAKER_04\n And when you get to 10 and want to go back, well, you have a problem.\n\n0:22:27\tSPEAKER_04\n You just must move more into the TV, you press 10 and you go to 10 and not to 1 and 0 after that.\n\n0:22:35\tSPEAKER_04\n So the button less.\n\n0:22:38\tSPEAKER_04\n And things like teletext, put them in the menu, things like...\n\n0:22:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:46\tSPEAKER_01\n What do you think about it back and forth come up?\n\n0:22:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Buttons, yeah.\n\n0:22:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:52\tSPEAKER_04\n Like an internet tech plan.\n\n0:22:54\tSPEAKER_04\n Trying to tell it is volume plus and minus.\n\n0:22:59\tSPEAKER_04\n And this is program plus and minus.\n\n0:23:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, but that is for going from 4 to 5.\n\n0:23:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:23:08\tSPEAKER_01\n But if you go from 2 to 8.\n\n0:23:10\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, you're watching 2U sports on 17.\n\n0:23:13\tSPEAKER_04\n And your wife is watching you can switch.\n\n0:23:15\tSPEAKER_04\n Switch easy.\n\n0:23:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, yes, I think that's a good idea.\n\n0:23:18\tSPEAKER_04\n But well, my friends would be put it in the menu.\n\n0:23:23\tSPEAKER_04\n And if you are using that button a lot of times, well, of course, that menu will still be displayed on the screen.\n\n0:23:29\tSPEAKER_04\n You just don't have to play games in between.\n\n0:23:32\tSPEAKER_04\n But if you're really switching between 2 channels, you won't have time to use the other options.\n\n0:23:40\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, well, I already told that.\n\n0:23:44\tSPEAKER_04\n That's why I conclude.\n\n0:23:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:23:50\tSPEAKER_03\n I think we can discuss a little about the three kind of revolutionary things Tim came with.\n\n0:23:59\tSPEAKER_03\n The parental control games and the voice recognition.\n\n0:24:05\tSPEAKER_03\n There's not too much decision on that one.\n\n0:24:08\tSPEAKER_03\n So I think the parental control is a good function to put in the remote.\n\n0:24:15\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know how you think about it.\n\n0:24:17\tSPEAKER_04\n There are all the languages put it in the menu structures somewhere.\n\n0:24:23\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, but properties and parents are comfortable.\n\n0:24:26\tSPEAKER_01\n How I see it is you put it on the remote.\n\n0:24:33\tSPEAKER_01\n And then you have like windows, log on screen with parents, children, something like that.\n\n0:24:43\tSPEAKER_01\n When you want to use a parents option, it has to be fast.\n\n0:24:48\tSPEAKER_04\n You don't want to go down and watch the news at 8 o'clock and turn it on.\n\n0:24:52\tSPEAKER_04\n Wait 20 seconds for the log on screen and remember your code.\n\n0:24:57\tSPEAKER_03\n But I think most people find it much more important that their children don't watch sexual violence on the television.\n\n0:25:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Wait 10 or 15 seconds longer so they can finally watch it because they use like with their XB simple log on the address.\n\n0:25:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Push parents and if you push parents then you have to log in.\n\n0:25:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Go to three digits and a few log in like two on three and it's in.\n\n0:25:29\tSPEAKER_04\n And if you push children you don't have to log in.\n\n0:25:37\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know if it's worth the time and effort we're going to spend on it.\n\n0:25:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, it's a simple function but it's going to take a lot of resources and a lot of time into programming because you'll have to start working with the profiles and such.\n\n0:25:52\tSPEAKER_00\n And I'm not sure if it's actually worth investing that much time and effort into it.\n\n0:25:57\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't think there's big markets for it because you read many times in magazines and stuff and you read on the news that.\n\n0:26:07\tSPEAKER_03\n They believe that children are influenced by television and well we're aiming to below 40 years.\n\n0:26:18\tSPEAKER_03\n But there are a lot of people below 40 who have children in young age who want them to not watch violent or anything.\n\n0:26:28\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, maybe some idea on that.\n\n0:26:31\tSPEAKER_04\n Just make the remote as it is.\n\n0:26:33\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:34\tSPEAKER_04\n But make an option to insert profiles because if my granddad would buy this remote he wouldn't want to bother with all the things to do.\n\n0:26:44\tSPEAKER_04\n Make it an option in the menu and install profiles or something.\n\n0:26:49\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:51\tSPEAKER_03\n That's a better idea.\n\n0:26:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:54\tSPEAKER_01\n It just has to be when it's delivered out of the store.\n\n0:26:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:59\tSPEAKER_01\n It has to be just simple and plain.\n\n0:27:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:02\tSPEAKER_01\n If you want to install it personally.\n\n0:27:06\tSPEAKER_01\n If I got kids and I could choose between two remote controls, one with parents controlling one without and I would buy the one with.\n\n0:27:21\tSPEAKER_04\n I still have some questions about how to incorporate it.\n\n0:27:26\tSPEAKER_04\n I'm thinking about some channels they cannot see but well when I think you have all the standard channels and only maybe after 10 o'clock in the evening, films and movies will come.\n\n0:27:41\tSPEAKER_04\n Maybe some timing will be instead of channels because if you're watching I don't know.\n\n0:27:50\tSPEAKER_04\n Or in a day cartoons will come up maybe Friday night.\n\n0:27:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe it can work with show view.\n\n0:27:59\tSPEAKER_03\n You can control your video recorder with show view.\n\n0:28:03\tSPEAKER_03\n When you take in the number it will start and end recording but maybe there's some option that.\n\n0:28:11\tSPEAKER_03\n The kind of show view numbers are violent and that they are blocked out.\n\n0:28:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Sometimes you have a phone and you have a phone that says someone who has sent all the show view numbers on the program.\n\n0:28:22\tSPEAKER_04\n But they do the remote and that's all.\n\n0:28:25\tSPEAKER_01\n They have a day that isn't possible.\n\n0:28:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Well if you want to incorporate the parental control, let's say we do.\n\n0:28:37\tSPEAKER_00\n What if a child goes up to the TV and presses up for instance?\n\n0:28:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Nobody is stopping a child from checking the channel.\n\n0:28:50\tSPEAKER_04\n Well you could say if a parental control is only it will go from 14 to 16 with that bad job.\n\n0:28:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Well I'm not sure because for that to happen you'll have to receive a signal from the remote control.\n\n0:29:07\tSPEAKER_00\n So it would be a constant signaling.\n\n0:29:10\tSPEAKER_00\n What may be better is to incorporate a separate device that you can program with the remote control.\n\n0:29:17\tSPEAKER_00\n And that provides parental control for instance.\n\n0:29:20\tSPEAKER_00\n And that's just an optional device.\n\n0:29:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Besides the remote control you will have a separate.\n\n0:29:28\tSPEAKER_03\n I wouldn't put an optional device and that it becomes too much I think.\n\n0:29:33\tSPEAKER_03\n If we do it we will do it in a kind of way he said like profile, parent profile, family profile.\n\n0:29:40\tSPEAKER_01\n And you know when you install another device children can still go up to the TV, pop open the thing and.\n\n0:29:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah that's true but in the same instant same happens when you have remote control.\n\n0:30:00\tSPEAKER_00\n The only difference is the people buying the remote control will now get the added feature of parental control.\n\n0:30:07\tSPEAKER_00\n And those people wouldn't necessarily want it.\n\n0:30:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah okay.\n\n0:30:12\tSPEAKER_01\n But it's just an added future.\n\n0:30:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay and what do you guys think of the games in the FOIS recognition?\n\n0:30:19\tSPEAKER_03\n I personally think that that becomes too much.\n\n0:30:22\tSPEAKER_04\n Well yeah it's more like a gadget of functionality.\n\n0:30:25\tSPEAKER_04\n Email to from management that it's very popular to use FOIS recognition.\n\n0:30:29\tSPEAKER_04\n But I don't think when you're watching TV and hearing loud noises from TV someone screaming, ah one and you're still chatting with each other.\n\n0:30:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah like FOIS recognition is too much I think.\n\n0:30:42\tSPEAKER_01\n In games?\n\n0:30:43\tSPEAKER_01\n I games.\n\n0:30:44\tSPEAKER_04\n I can see games I can't put it on the chip anyway so.\n\n0:30:49\tSPEAKER_04\n That doesn't it's a primary feature of the remote.\n\n0:30:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources.\n\n0:30:56\tSPEAKER_03\n So that will that must be in it you think.\n\n0:31:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah that will be nice.\n\n0:31:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay so the games are in it the FOIS recognition are not and the parental control are optional.\n\n0:31:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah it's in it but how do we do it?\n\n0:31:12\tSPEAKER_04\n I think so.\n\n0:31:14\tSPEAKER_04\n Well I think also it's a good idea but it's very difficult to incorporate so we should make it to complex.\n\n0:31:20\tSPEAKER_04\n So some manual function you choose parental control and maybe FOIS will emerge when you put it on.\n\n0:31:27\tSPEAKER_04\n But how it's going to work?\n\n0:31:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah but will there like the first idea from you can buy it without a wet parental control?\n\n0:31:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Or are we going to put it in and just?\n\n0:31:44\tSPEAKER_04\n I think best would be to put it in and make it in the menu option.\n\n0:31:48\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah to put it in always.\n\n0:31:50\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah and you can just when you buy it you can select the personal preference, parental control, home and capacity or something.\n\n0:31:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Well I don't know if you had two different remote you could choose one with receiver in it.\n\n0:32:09\tSPEAKER_00\n So you could actually easily build in parental control but it would be more expensive.\n\n0:32:17\tSPEAKER_00\n So in that way you could make cheap moral and expensive moral.\n\n0:32:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Could we make the simple moral, do you like moral for instance?\n\n0:32:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah but TVs aren't capable of sending.\n\n0:32:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes they are.\n\n0:32:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah I thought they were just...\n\n0:32:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah you have some to receive.\n\n0:32:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah but most of them... That is true.\n\n0:32:39\tSPEAKER_04\n Maybe you just have to restrict it to what program so the parents says you cannot watch channel 7, 9 and 10.\n\n0:32:45\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah and you cannot watch all channels after 10 o'clock and there's just some little clock in the middle.\n\n0:32:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Well yeah you could easily do that after the market but you still have the problem about the television itself.\n\n0:32:59\tSPEAKER_04\n I know it's very simple, I have seen some of the remote who have a clock in it.\n\n0:33:05\tSPEAKER_04\n So the remote doesn't transmit when it's off the wall.\n\n0:33:09\tSPEAKER_01\n But on the TV at least my TV is a compartment which you can press and there are buttons behind it which you can use.\n\n0:33:19\tSPEAKER_04\n If you don't have a pool it's very blunt that's not our problem just have the parents buy it as a glue and it's not part of the remote.\n\n0:33:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah of course.\n\n0:33:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah that is true.\n\n0:33:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah you could go and like that would actually make things a lot more easy.\n\n0:33:37\tSPEAKER_00\n You could just buy them on television.\n\n0:33:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Make it that problem.\n\n0:33:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah I figured we could do that.\n\n0:33:46\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not sure what marketing thinks about it but...\n\n0:33:52\tSPEAKER_01\n I have to consult my legal at first.\n\n0:33:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay so I think we have decided on the things that from Janus the energy, the combination between battery and kinetic.\n\n0:34:08\tSPEAKER_03\n The case will be double curve and rubber in a flashy fruity color.\n\n0:34:16\tSPEAKER_03\n With cover is removable, the buttons will be touchscreen but they may not be too many buttons.\n\n0:34:24\tSPEAKER_03\n And in the menu structure there must not be five minutes to go.\n\n0:34:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Too many levels and it must be easy to use.\n\n0:34:37\tSPEAKER_03\n The parental control will be incorporated but it must be not too complex and the games are in it.\n\n0:34:44\tSPEAKER_03\n So I think we have a little more.\n\n0:34:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh I have one thing left.\n\n0:34:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe for Jerome.\n\n0:34:58\tSPEAKER_01\n The fuse.\n\n0:35:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe it's handy to build an expert view and a simple view.\n\n0:35:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Like a mode or something.\n\n0:35:10\tSPEAKER_04\n The expert view you have in the menu structure when you don't use it is simple.\n\n0:35:16\tSPEAKER_04\n And when you do system properties, entire list pops up and all kind of stuff you can pull.\n\n0:35:22\tSPEAKER_03\n It's already incorporated a little.\n\n0:35:25\tSPEAKER_00\n You could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself for a more advanced user.\n\n0:35:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Which buttons do you want to in it?\n\n0:35:34\tSPEAKER_00\n You can build in a back forward button and somebody would just want to watch two channels.\n\n0:35:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Just leave the other numbers away.\n\n0:35:44\tSPEAKER_00\n You could have people want to.\n\n0:35:47\tSPEAKER_03\n We take it to the other meeting.\n\n0:35:51\tSPEAKER_03\n I went to a master class and two things can come in handy for us.\n\n0:35:59\tSPEAKER_03\n The first thing is we talked about knowledge management, knowledge engineering and the fact that the idea of knowledge sharing and learning knowledge from other companies.\n\n0:36:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Like that.\n\n0:36:15\tSPEAKER_03\n It's very hot at the moment.\n\n0:36:17\tSPEAKER_03\n So it's mostly for the management expert to look what other marketing.\n\n0:36:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Just talking about my self.\n\n0:36:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, come on.\n\n0:36:32\tSPEAKER_03\n What other companies had also with the marketing campaign when they put on a new remote just some import export?\n\n0:36:44\tSPEAKER_03\n And another one?\n\n0:36:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Benchmark.\n\n0:36:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Benchmark.\n\n0:36:47\tSPEAKER_03\n That's the word I saw.\n\n0:36:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Another thing is there was a survey and it came out that people like to buy things from a single large provider instead of those who are partnering with us.\n\n0:37:06\tSPEAKER_03\n So we must bring it as if a real reaction is a big company, a trust for company.\n\n0:37:14\tSPEAKER_01\n I know a marketing name for it.\n\n0:37:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:37:20\tSPEAKER_01\n R to the third power.\n\n0:37:23\tSPEAKER_03\n R3.\n\n0:37:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Real reaction remote.\n\n0:37:26\tSPEAKER_03\n I had another idea to put the whole idea of a real reaction and a single brand and that kind of thing.\n\n0:37:35\tSPEAKER_03\n When you put on the remote you see kind of just like when you're a little...\n\n0:37:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Real reaction remote.\n\n0:37:44\tSPEAKER_03\n With the motto we put fashion electronics and then you go...\n\n0:37:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, but it has to be like a second because you have to put in a code also.\n\n0:37:54\tSPEAKER_04\n You can show somebody a logo for 0.5 seconds.\n\n0:37:57\tSPEAKER_04\n They'll still remember it.\n\n0:37:59\tSPEAKER_03\n But Linguron every time you see it.\n\n0:38:02\tSPEAKER_03\n The idea from this thing is that we must present it as we are a single large provider who will stand on our own.\n\n0:38:08\tSPEAKER_00\n If you have the LCD screen you can have a small logo at the bottom and you can just stay there.\n\n0:38:15\tSPEAKER_00\n That spins around.\n\n0:38:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that spins around.\n\n0:38:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Also, but we are...\n\n0:38:20\tSPEAKER_01\n It's just like a globe.\n\n0:38:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it's a little bit smaller.\n\n0:38:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Think about that kind of thing.\n\n0:38:28\tSPEAKER_03\n That's what they said in the Masterclass.\n\n0:38:31\tSPEAKER_03\n And Shin\u00c3\u00a9va.\n\n0:38:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Next meeting starts in 30 minutes.\n\n0:38:36\tSPEAKER_03\n So maybe you can go to Paris and Milan.\n\n0:38:39\tSPEAKER_01\n What's again?\n\n0:38:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Who gave you the Masterclass?\n\n0:38:42\tSPEAKER_01\n The Masterclass.\n\n0:38:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Ronald Batemburg.\n\n0:38:44\tSPEAKER_03\n French Mellars.\n\n0:38:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, thanks.\n\n0:38:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Very special.\n\n0:38:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Next session.\n\n0:38:51\tSPEAKER_03\n I did the industrial development session.\n\n0:38:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Usually in the face.\n\n0:38:58\tSPEAKER_03\n We'll work together on a prototype.\n\n0:39:00\tSPEAKER_03\n And we'll drawing it on the smartboard.\n\n0:39:03\tSPEAKER_03\n So that's a kind of newer thing.\n\n0:39:05\tSPEAKER_03\n And the marketing expert will be keeping busy with the product evaluation.\n\n0:39:14\tSPEAKER_03\n But the most specific instructions we sent to you by E-Mem.\n\n0:39:17\tSPEAKER_00\n So we're going to work together right now?\n\n0:39:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, well, this is what I heard.\n\n0:39:23\tSPEAKER_03\n The Masterclass.\n\n0:39:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Not the Masterclass.\n\n0:39:28\tSPEAKER_03\n So you just wait for the specific instructions.\n\n0:39:32\tSPEAKER_03\n But I think it was a very good session.\n\n0:39:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Gentlemen.\n\n0:39:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Definitely.\n\n0:39:37\tSPEAKER_04\n No new ones.\n\n0:39:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, thank you all.\n\n0:39:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, thank you.\n\n0:39:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Thank you very much.\n\n0:39:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Thank you, too.\n\n0:39:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Give me your good evaluation.\n\n0:39:49\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, guys.\n\n0:39:50\tSPEAKER_03\n You were success.\n\n0:39:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Cheers.\n\n0:39:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Cheers.\n\n0:39:53\tSPEAKER_03\n See you in a half hour.\n\n0:39:56\tSPEAKER_03\n But keep an eye on your left foot.\n\n0:40:00\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not sure if real, because I saw something about individual actions.\n\n0:40:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but there's still my instructions that you will work together.\n\n0:40:10\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:40:11\tSPEAKER_04\n Here or that's not my problem.\n\n0:40:13\tSPEAKER_03\n My buy.\n\n0:40:14\tSPEAKER_03\n So, super managers.\n\n0:40:16\tSPEAKER_03\n The product manager always works alone.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "SPEAKER is at the conceptual design meeting for
