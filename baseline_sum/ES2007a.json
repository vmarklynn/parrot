Do you want it small?\n\n0:11:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Medium.\n\n0:11:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Are we going for like telephones or going little teeny tiny things?\n\n0:11:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Or are we going for something that's big and...\n\n0:11:56\tSPEAKER_00\n It seems like there's like...\n\n0:11:58\tSPEAKER_00\n There's sort of a tension between two ideas.\n\n0:12:00\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, you want one remote that maybe can work all of the functions of TV.\n\n0:12:04\tSPEAKER_00\n And if you have whatever associated with the TV, the DVD players...\n\n0:12:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Video.\n\n0:12:10\tSPEAKER_00\n It's the same time you don't want a really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something.\n\n0:12:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe, yeah.\n\n0:12:18\tSPEAKER_02\n That's the other thing is it's going to be cheap.\n\n0:12:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Because I was thinking something that's got different...\n\n0:12:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Like maybe an LCD display on it that's got different pages for different devices.\n\n0:12:34\tSPEAKER_02\n But that would probably be quite expensive.\n\n0:12:36\tSPEAKER_03\n But how do we know how much...\n\n0:12:40\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, how much do we have per...\n\n0:12:44\tSPEAKER_03\n How much?\n\n0:12:46\tSPEAKER_00\n You can't be more than $1.250 per unit.\n\n0:12:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Per unit, yeah.\n\n0:12:50\tSPEAKER_04\n So do we have to be realistic within the budget for...\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, at the moment, we could...\n\n0:12:56\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, because we...\n\n0:12:58\tSPEAKER_02\n This is what we're doing at the moment. It's just saying what we'd like.\n\n0:13:00\tSPEAKER_02\n And then after we've found out what we can like, some different ideas...\n\n0:13:04\tSPEAKER_02\n We've researched to find out if any of these ideas are feasible or not.\n\n0:13:09\tSPEAKER_02\n So it would be nice to have something that controls lots of different things.\n\n0:13:14\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:16\tSPEAKER_05\n Couldn't we have like one that comes out?\n\n0:13:20\tSPEAKER_05\n Like, so you have one in...\n\n0:13:23\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_05\n It doesn't have to be really thick. I mean, rock controls can be thin bits.\n\n0:13:28\tSPEAKER_05\n And then you have one of your DVD and you sort of slide it out.\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_05\n And then it all comes compact.\n\n0:13:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, that's the line.\n\n0:13:38\tSPEAKER_05\n So it's not...\n\n0:13:39\tSPEAKER_05\n You're actually just putting three or four different remotes together, but making them thinner and into one.\n\n0:13:46\tSPEAKER_05\n That's the idea.\n\n0:13:48\tSPEAKER_05\n So you just flip them out.\n\n0:13:50\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:13:52\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, have one very complicated one on one side with all the DVD and VCR, and then on the other side, one remote control, that would be very, very simple.\n\n0:14:04\tSPEAKER_04\n It's just the channel program plus and minus.\n\n0:14:07\tSPEAKER_04\n And then just the mute button, for example.\n\n0:14:10\tSPEAKER_04\n I can really, really, really simple on one side.\n\n0:14:12\tSPEAKER_04\n And the other side would be very complicated.\n\n0:14:14\tSPEAKER_02\n One side for kids, one side for adults.\n\n0:14:16\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm actually...\n\n0:14:17\tSPEAKER_04\n Of grandma as well, you know.\n\n0:14:19\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two-sided remote, because it would be very hard to use in a way that you...\n\n0:14:24\tSPEAKER_04\n No, but you would slide it into something...\n\n0:14:27\tSPEAKER_04\n Like something on the back would hold.\n\n0:14:29\tSPEAKER_04\n Like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons.\n\n0:14:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Like it or something like a flip telephone, something like that, maybe.\n\n0:14:36\tSPEAKER_05\n That'd be cool.\n\n0:14:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Flip it open and you've got all the buttons or you flip it closed and you've just got their basic buttons on the outside, maybe.\n\n0:14:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, we've got five minutes left.\n\n0:14:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Start breaking up.\n\n0:14:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:14:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, we've got a few ideas there.\n\n0:14:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we should...\n\n0:15:01\tSPEAKER_00\n I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a rough conceptual.\n\n0:15:05\tSPEAKER_00\n The stage one was technical functions designed, what effect the apperata should have.\n\n0:15:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:15:12\tSPEAKER_00\n So I mean, we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface.\n\n0:15:16\tSPEAKER_00\n But the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the TV but also devices connected to the TV.\n\n0:15:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:24\tSPEAKER_00\n We'll be able to operate the DVD players.\n\n0:15:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Things like that.\n\n0:15:31\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we should also have a backup plan of...\n\n0:15:34\tSPEAKER_02\n I just think that it might be expensive to make something that...\n\n0:15:38\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything.\n\n0:15:42\tSPEAKER_02\n We should have a backup plan of just a really good television remote control that is just for a TV but it's just a really good, nice one.\n\n0:15:53\tSPEAKER_02\n What do you reckon?\n\n0:15:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:57\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm just thinking, Baron, we have something that's cheap to make.\n\n0:16:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n0:16:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe we should just concentrate on having a good TV remote and have it be...\n\n0:16:06\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker.\n\n0:16:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Have it be like ergonomic.\n\n0:16:11\tSPEAKER_00\n It's comfortable to use, simple to use and looks decent.\n\n0:16:15\tSPEAKER_05\n We know maybe...\n\n0:16:17\tSPEAKER_05\n We'll make it interesting for people to buy though.\n\n0:16:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Or maybe even something that's for disabled people or some people that don't see very well or...\n\n0:16:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Big buttons for touchy buttons for...\n\n0:16:29\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm going to find a niche for our remote like market it to a certain kind of people.\n\n0:16:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, just one that looks really fucking cool.\n\n0:16:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, no, I think you're in.\n\n0:16:45\tSPEAKER_04\n Could be really light or, I don't know, sometimes, special.\n\n0:16:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Rather than focus on...\n\n0:16:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Otherwise, we'll be talking about how to do this and do that.\n\n0:16:55\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we should...\n\n0:16:56\tSPEAKER_04\n It will be end of the day if it says just TV remote doesn't say combination at all.\n\n0:17:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Obviously everyone...\n\n0:17:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Sounds like we're all a bit gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once.\n\n0:17:08\tSPEAKER_00\n But remote's spinning out from other remotes.\n\n0:17:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Having a little nested remotes and say, yeah, that's right.\n\n0:17:14\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, I'd like one that makes tea as well, but that's not going to happen.\n\n0:17:19\tSPEAKER_05\n I think a flip up thing, because you always have this problem of like if it's on the...\n\n0:17:23\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, I didn't know it.\n\n0:17:24\tSPEAKER_05\n Like we had five or six remotes and they'd be lying on the couch and you'd come and sit down and...\n\n0:17:29\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, the television switch down or something.\n\n0:17:32\tSPEAKER_05\n So maybe something that like...\n\n0:17:35\tSPEAKER_05\n Does have a lid or closes so you don't accidentally press a button or...\n\n0:17:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, like a lot functional it like you have when you're telephones.\n\n0:17:45\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:46\tSPEAKER_05\n But make it like really snazzy and cool with people who want it.\n\n0:17:49\tSPEAKER_05\n So make it, yeah.\n\n0:17:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it's going to be sellable.\n\n0:17:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n0:17:53\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, it doesn't have to have a flip function.\n\n0:17:54\tSPEAKER_00\n It can just have a lock function so that it's not usable when you don't want it to be used.\n\n0:17:59\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:00\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:18:01\tSPEAKER_05\n And even for kids as well, it's safer for them, I guess.\n\n0:18:04\tSPEAKER_05\n Like they don't flick onto channels that are not allowed to flick onto.\n\n0:18:09\tSPEAKER_02\n No porn channel for children.\n\n0:18:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:18:14\tSPEAKER_02\n All right, so we've got some ideas.\n\n0:18:17\tSPEAKER_02\n I guess that's move on.\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's close that.\n\n0:18:24\tSPEAKER_01\n What does ID, VID and E stand for?\n\n0:18:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Industrial designer.\n\n0:18:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:18:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Which is...\n\n0:18:34\tSPEAKER_05\n These are kind of specific.\n\n0:18:36\tSPEAKER_05\n And I'm marketing.\n\n0:18:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:40\tSPEAKER_02\n There you go.\n\n0:18:41\tSPEAKER_02\n So let's...\n\n0:18:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Use your interface designer.\n\n0:18:46\tSPEAKER_02\n That's me.\n\n0:18:47\tSPEAKER_02\n That's...\n\n0:18:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:18:49\tSPEAKER_02\n That's you.\n\n0:18:50\tSPEAKER_02\n So you're going to be the one that's working out what buttons we need.\n\n0:18:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:18:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Industrial designer.\n\n0:18:59\tSPEAKER_02\n You're the one that...\n\n0:19:00\tSPEAKER_02\n You know, you're going to be working out kind of box it goes in, I guess.\n\n0:19:04\tSPEAKER_02\n So...\n\n0:19:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Whether it's...\n\n0:19:09\tSPEAKER_02\n I...\n\n0:19:10\tSPEAKER_02\n What goes into the box somehow?\n\n0:19:14\tSPEAKER_03\n How it works.\n\n0:19:17\tSPEAKER_02\n And the marketing.\n\n0:19:19\tSPEAKER_05\n These are quite...\n\n0:19:21\tSPEAKER_01\n These are quite...\n\n0:19:22\tSPEAKER_05\n So what the user requires...\n\n0:19:24\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, what?\n\n0:19:25\tSPEAKER_00\n And what?\n\n0:19:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Right, okay, yeah.\n\n0:19:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, that's...\n\n0:19:28\tSPEAKER_00\n I guess.\n\n0:19:29\tSPEAKER_00\n You two...\n\n0:19:30\tSPEAKER_02\n You two are going to be...\n\n0:19:32\tSPEAKER_02\n I think you just double...\n\n0:19:34\tSPEAKER_02\n You know, you're working together.\n\n0:19:36\tSPEAKER_02\n You're the one that's going to go and find out...\n\n0:19:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Do the research.\n\n0:19:40\tSPEAKER_02\n See what people want in a remote.\n\n0:19:42\tSPEAKER_02\n What buttons are used more often and stuff like that.\n\n0:19:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, we've been warned to finish the meeting now.\n\n0:19:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:19:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, everyone.\n\n0:19:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Well done.\n\n0:19:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Good meeting.\n\n0:19:59\tSPEAKER_00\n All right.\n\n0:20:00\tNone\n See you in 30 minutes.\n\n0:20:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:02\tSPEAKER_05\n So, do we take this off?\n\n0:20:05\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "The agenda for the meeting is: Opening project, training tool, discussion,
