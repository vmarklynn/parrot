{"filename": "./data/Bmr008.txt", "transcript": "0:00:00\tSPEAKER_07\n Yeah, I do or I like it also like this\n\n0:00:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, so let's\n\n0:00:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Of course that's true of a lapel\n\n0:00:16\tSPEAKER_05\n Let's discuss the dead items. What did we have?\n\n0:00:19\tSPEAKER_02\n You were I have a couple things about speaker form about forms in general. Okay forms\n\n0:00:25\tSPEAKER_05\n There's one thing There's status on the Transcription discussion which will take us about 30 seconds And then Jose as usual of the one among us who's actually doing a bunch of things on this He has this and I think we can have some a just glancing through if so I think we have something to discuss about\n\n0:00:52\tSPEAKER_06\n And Um\n\n0:00:55\tSPEAKER_05\n We just sent in that NSF pre proposal, but I don't think there's much to say about that except you sent it in\n\n0:01:03\tSPEAKER_06\n See what happens um Anybody anything anything else Okay\n\n0:01:12\tSPEAKER_02\n So why don't I do it in that order? Okay, I probably should have printed out more of these So one of the things that I've been doing with the digit forms is I've been adding more and more speaker specific information to them And it's getting pretty crowded and you have to fill it out each time So what I thought was it would be nice to have a single speaker form that you fill out once And then on the digits form you just have to put your name down and you can look it up from the speaker form So I had a first pass of it and I spoke with Jane a bit about how to specify What language and education and that sort of stuff and so I have a first pass at it And I was just wondering if you had any comments on information that should or shouldn't be on it and I only did one copy Which is really stupid of me um, so I'll just sort of say what it's on them then I can hand it around so the top of it is Name, sex, email or other contact information I put the contact information just in case we have people with the same name So that you can distinguish them and then also just have a separate contact from the consent form And then we talked a little bit about whether to do How we get at the background and we could do profession, but it's so uniform that we figured what was more important was actually the education level Um, at least that would get at some idea of their background. So I have a and it's also relevant to status and relevant to status So that what I have is uh, status\n\n0:02:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Which might affect the discourse aspects\n\n0:02:32\tSPEAKER_02\n So oh, that's kind of status. Okay, so I have five things that you can circle undergrad grad postdoc professor and then other with a colon in a place where you can fill in if there's some other So I think the problem with that is that there's not a necessarily easy equivalent for our visitors who are not used to the US education levels And may need some help to translate what that means\n\n0:02:57\tSPEAKER_05\n How fine a resolution do you need on that for this? If you're missing maybe not so much student non-student\n\n0:03:06\tSPEAKER_01\n I Can you just write something like position?\n\n0:03:11\tSPEAKER_01\n And people can fill in their own For a visitor or whatever well the problem with that is\n\n0:03:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Um, I think the same as the problem of profession That it will be there will be a tendency all for everyone to put down speech researcher or or something at that granularity So I don't think there's a problem asking the education level. I at least I don't feel like there is um, I think the only question is whether what categories should there be?\n\n0:03:37\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that so I did or were you suggesting that it should be more fine-grained than this?\n\n0:03:43\tSPEAKER_00\n No, no less What would you suggest as a change?\n\n0:03:51\tSPEAKER_05\n Um Would you think this I don't really know I mean were you thinking that it would be useful for some research later to know say you said undergrad For instance, so undergrad versus grad do you think that's important?\n\n0:04:03\tSPEAKER_00\n I do and the reason is because I think that um, we haven't been aggressive doing this As others here at at Berkeley that um, I think there's almost like a quantum leap from undergrad in terms of like the status You know, it's in various ways like simply trying to meet with a professor during office hours You know in my department as always case for instance how huge amount of different priority and we're treated as equals and and help helpers, you know, and in research uh, uh, uh, roles and things that they they in terms of like this the social dynamics of interactions I would expect them to be less different and um, maybe less assertive of their own views and things like that I don't think that we're going to have a lot of undergrad Right how about?\n\n0:04:51\tSPEAKER_07\n branch out to different types of meetings You could say if you're giving a talk how likely are you to be challenged?\n\n0:04:57\tNone\n This is the dimension Well, this is the dimension. Well, one of the one of the criteria I had for designing this form is that I didn't want a separate instruction sheet And so we'll get to that in a moment when we talk about language also is I did not want to have to you know come down and quiz each person and have a uh, social dynamics expert being the one who's filling out the answers I wanted to be self-evaluating you can give it to them and they understand what you're asking\n\n0:05:21\tSPEAKER_00\n And it's non-threatening because this compared to you know exactly what level of professorship and\n\n0:05:26\tSPEAKER_07\n Well, sounds like you really need to know something kind of like that you need to know sort of base in this meeting\n\n0:05:33\tSPEAKER_02\n That's a set of social status So we'll get to that in a moment\n\n0:05:37\tSPEAKER_00\n I agree that this is the motivation was things that could affect social dynamics in ways that are relevant to the research without being threatening to the person\n\n0:05:45\tSPEAKER_02\n And this particular form I know so this particular form is speaker is dependent only on the speaker not on the meeting Mm-hmm. You could imagine then having another form that you might want to do during a meeting to get out the relationships But then that's interfering with the meeting so what I like about this information is you give it to them once and they fill it out once And then you have that information\n\n0:06:08\tSPEAKER_00\n So discuss the idea of having the separate dtds would handle maybe specific meetings specific things Dtd The data is you know his XML thing you got the data type definition document type definition part that's can be used for\n\n0:06:22\tSPEAKER_07\n relational. I guess I guess it seems to me like you know trying to deduce information about the person's status From the meeting independent form will be useless because not at all\n\n0:06:35\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean the fact that one person's an undergrad and the others a full professor is interesting So the question is how much of this information\n\n0:06:42\tSPEAKER_07\n Um, but that will depend on what the meetings about right? Let's say the undergrad was an expert in physics\n\n0:06:48\tSPEAKER_02\n You want to have that information right? So if you don't have that information\n\n0:06:51\tSPEAKER_07\n Mm-hmm. How are you going to do anything? I guess I'm wondering how can you make a conclusion? Based on that if you don't know about the meeting\n\n0:06:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, you know, we're talking him at a general level of description. You can always get more specific\n\n0:07:04\tSPEAKER_07\n I mean, so what would you suggest? I don't know. I'm just that's why I was wondering about if you can put something about that\n\n0:07:09\tSPEAKER_02\n You repeat the categories you had maybe the right undergrad grad postdoc professor other\n\n0:07:14\tSPEAKER_01\n So yeah, I think that's fine except the one thing is there a lot of x-e- like I don't know what I would be here just I'm not a professor I'm not a oh that's right now. I was saying professor Visitor x-e visitor x-e I mean uh, visiting\n\n0:07:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, when I said professor, I guess what I was thinking in my mind was more\n\n0:07:32\tSPEAKER_05\n PhD, but not postdoc. How about so yeah, but most PhD researchers\n\n0:07:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, then then I think what you have is great for that purpose would we change postdoc to\n\n0:07:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Or just PhD researcher or maybe postdoc change postdoc to PhD because I think PhD and professor are\n\n0:07:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Distinct, aren't they? What's a PhD like if you have a PhD and you're hanging around here and you're not a professor And you're not a postdoc then that's like what we are\n\n0:08:00\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, so for me there's there's a there are people and this got very tricky in fact when we got involved with the Spanish program Actually because When we said in our original forms postdoc we were used to from the German program and from the US standard You say postdoc it meant somebody who just got in the PhD was doing one year someplace But when we did the Spanish call many people said oh, I want to be have a postdoc slot and they were 20 years out Right because they were post their\n\n0:08:29\tSPEAKER_01\n So post PhD researcher or I think there's one more category that sort of\n\n0:08:34\tSPEAKER_05\n It might be hard to do a finer thing than that because whether somebody is going to be dominant in a meeting Is really I think it's going to be so cluttered by everything else someone who's just gotten their PhD Could be very very strongly opinionated about something and somebody who's been 20 years out could be showing me so maybe undergrad grad post PhD and other\n\n0:08:55\tSPEAKER_02\n What's other\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_07\n Other European\n\n0:08:59\tSPEAKER_01\n I think you could keep professor, but you could say post PhD instead of instead of Professor instead of post post postdoc or post PhD just wrap all the people that are post PhD and non-professors together\n\n0:09:13\tSPEAKER_05\n Professor to be in a separate category\n\n0:09:16\tSPEAKER_02\n So as I said undergrad undergrad grad post PhD professor other\n\n0:09:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, yeah, the post PhD one is the one that can be like post postdoc or post PhD researcher or whatever. Yeah, right then it'd be fun\n\n0:09:32\tSPEAKER_05\n So I'm telling to push towards simpler even though I understand more detailed means More potential information for someone later who's doing research in this area. I the the thing Me lean towards simpler where possible is that the more thing Many of the meetings that we record Maybe the kind where we just record somebody wants even though we want to get a lot of data that has many meetings with the same people And so the more forms we have the more lines and the forms that's the more overhead for that one time thing makes it harder to do\n\n0:10:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Well the whole reason that I'm doing it this way is my experience so far has been the exact reverse\n\n0:10:11\tSPEAKER_05\n Right, that's what we've done so far, right, and so I'm saying I expect us to do both kinds\n\n0:10:16\tSPEAKER_02\n I guess we could have another type of form for\n\n0:10:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Less frequent so you understand he wants to do this only once for each person. Yes\n\n0:10:24\tSPEAKER_05\n So I'm saying there are going to be what I imagine once we've collected a lot of data a chunk of it will be The same people many times and another chunk of will be people random meetings that we got from different people And I think it's used we've talked about this before it's useful to have both kinds of data\n\n0:10:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I think that if we're planning to do that then we should probably have another set of forms Okay, you know a single form that's the consent form and the speaker information form and not have them do\n\n0:10:48\tSPEAKER_07\n Digits, okay, no, I like the idea of putting down the the status information because I think you probably can get a lot of Interested there can be a lot of interesting research on that. I'm wondering could we add something to the form that gets filled out at each meeting that would somehow\n\n0:11:03\tSPEAKER_02\n This is a topic I want to bring up yeah after I get through this okay, so that that's another form that I want to discuss\n\n0:11:10\tSPEAKER_07\n With the digits forms. I guess I was thinking can we get maybe you know how you were taking information off of the digits and putting it onto that Could we put one more thing on that's what I want to talk about and I have that as a topic also okay?\n\n0:11:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's finish it. It's a speaker form so I thought maybe speaker forming then we'll get over okay over to that one So education level undergrad grad post PhD professor other okay Um, and then I put optional with a big optional in parentheses age We want that optional because I think a lot of people are sensitive to it and won't want to write it down So I don't want to make them feel like they have to I\n\n0:11:47\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know it would be very good to get age for a lot of purposes\n\n0:11:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Sure, but if someone doesn't want to write it down. I don't want them to say you can't record me\n\n0:11:59\tSPEAKER_05\n It's not illegal right? It's not pushing on anything on ethical. Whatever to ask for the age right? Every most corporate have that you know, I suggest you ask for their age and if they say I don't want to give it say okay\n\n0:12:09\tSPEAKER_00\n And in like the one and one they they the researchers himself estimate the age afterward after the facts they say you know Middle 30s, you know 50s or 60s and they and they just they estimate for the person well\n\n0:12:24\tSPEAKER_02\n I think that's just having on the form saying optional age again means I don't have to be sitting here and explaining the form every time We do this and having a little instruction sheet and say if you're in this state age do this and if you're in this age do that\n\n0:12:37\tSPEAKER_00\n So how about how about optional but highly desirable\n\n0:12:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Age or approximate age That's why I can say 30s if they're 39\n\n0:12:51\tSPEAKER_05\n Age is optional, but those who don't give it will be given the uncomfortable microphones\n\n0:12:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Well those who don't give it we will be estimating your age\n\n0:12:59\tSPEAKER_07\n If not given we will estimate\n\n0:13:01\tSPEAKER_05\n So maybe the mean of the estimates from the group will be used\n\n0:13:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah people can leave it blank if they decide I think people in speech are going to like it\n\n0:13:15\tSPEAKER_07\n They're very strong will you know\n\n0:13:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I think maybe that's because no one here is sensitive about their age they can always lie But I would rather live them leave it blank than lie So that's why I want to put that's why I want to put some optional age So that I think don't want to put it they leave it blank They might lie anyway But if you put optional won't they just leave it blank or I don't know\n\n0:13:38\tSPEAKER_07\n Okay, I think I think you can put optional\n\n0:13:41\tSPEAKER_05\n I mean the people the people I've known who've lied about it I think we just lie about it\n\n0:13:45\tSPEAKER_02\n You don't think they just leave it blank if it says has no optional right I think it's to it\n\n0:13:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Well they might leave a blank if they didn't care about their age being known But it says optional they might\n\n0:13:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Hey Jack Benny was 39 for 40 years\n\n0:13:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Anyway, it's fine. I don't know. Well the thing the reason one reason for putting optional might be if It made the form seem gentler and not as it used Kind of a gentler That you know if you say optional then it's sort of if people who get nervous about the age question Then they realize that oh well, but they're not trying to\n\n0:14:22\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, I think it's okay people will put it I think it matters if it makes you more comfortable with optional I think it's I think it's better to put optional and that's why I put it there\n\n0:14:30\tSPEAKER_02\n It's but it seems like maybe you disagree I don't think it's important\n\n0:14:34\tSPEAKER_05\n But I also don't think it's an important point the other way and I don't Yeah, I don't want to make you do it some different way than you want to do it so\n\n0:14:42\tSPEAKER_01\n She's long as we put it high enough up that it doesn't sort of get lost in the optional If there are a lot of other optional things on why didn't mark anything else as specifically optional things\n\n0:14:51\tSPEAKER_02\n so And then the next are two sections one indented separately So once for native English speakers and one for non native English speakers Okay, so for the native English speaker it asks for a variety of English with three circle boxes American British Indian and other for right in\n\n0:15:09\tSPEAKER_05\n Now what was this thing that who was telling it was a Steve? Somebody was telling us about asking about\n\n0:15:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Where you live between the ages of yeah, Jane and I discussed this and it was it was again the same problem That it's going to be a self-evaluation anyway and so I don't want to have to be standing over the person and asking them Well, do you mean that your native ang- what in language was British when you were born and then it changed to American when you were two and then it changed to\n\n0:15:37\tSPEAKER_00\n So he has a separate subject for region And so it's a self-assessment of what you think your closest variety is of English and then following that a characterization of A region now we discussed maybe indicating a time frame. So where did you live during your, you know, childhood\n\n0:15:55\tSPEAKER_07\n Which would be which is more objective than somebody by saying I think I speak this or that\n\n0:16:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes\n\n0:16:05\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, there's a story on the forum to put a line of instruction, but I'm just not sure what it should really be\n\n0:16:11\tSPEAKER_05\n I just miss something though. Are you saying that you have both that you're saying what is your so the\n\n0:16:16\tSPEAKER_02\n for The non-native English speakers we have a variety of English and region. Yeah, and that's it And then we have another form later down which is list other language influences\n\n0:16:30\tSPEAKER_01\n So what does region? Yeah, I'm like if I see this form I wouldn't be quite sure what you mean by region Right need to would I do you want to give choices and have them circle on or I mean\n\n0:16:40\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't mean we do that because it would be different for Where where you lived during a childhood region of the US or region of the if you're American English it would be region of the US Okay, so that's why I didn't have circle forms because it would be different depending on What your languages so\n\n0:16:56\tSPEAKER_07\n Do you mean state or do you mean more broad than the state level? You mean like you know Southern US or northeastern\n\n0:17:03\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it would be however you would identify your own and as I said I don't really see a way of doing a circle Fill in because there would be there would have to be one for American English one for British English one for you know\n\n0:17:14\tSPEAKER_07\n Wanted to give regions for American English you could copy what they didn't him it they divided things up and uh\n\n0:17:20\tSPEAKER_02\n But that would mean I would have to do generated different form for circles if you're American English or British\n\n0:17:25\tSPEAKER_07\n No, no, it would only be if you said American English then you'd put it for the others You would just leave it yeah, we wouldn't have enough to really make a difference on those and you know when you talk about dialects in England\n\n0:17:36\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean that's really every block of London have it there so\n\n0:17:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I haven't seen what they did in time. Are you do they have a bunch of options like uh?\n\n0:17:47\tSPEAKER_07\n It's like six regions of the country or something very just a limited number and then if you're Americans You would just circle the region\n\n0:17:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, that you know that was the concept of having the region thing There'd be no problem to change it to options if\n\n0:18:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I just don't know what to do about the other varieties of English you just leave them\n\n0:18:09\tSPEAKER_01\n You don't even have there are huge differences, you know, well, that's why I wanted to just think it's something that you could write it down Better to just do it for the Yeah, you could leave region for for the others, but have circled choice for the American\n\n0:18:24\tSPEAKER_07\n English one one good reason to use the timet ones is if anybody asks you You know about the data later on you can say well, I chose these based on timet. What about just doing\n\n0:18:35\tSPEAKER_05\n The sort of the Steve suggestion as as an add-on to it right rather than saying region Just say where did you live between the ages of\n\n0:18:45\tSPEAKER_07\n That was the concept and that would apply to everybody then yes And then you could map those to the timet regions later Yeah, they could say different ways more general Cincinnati or they could submit west that's true\n\n0:18:55\tSPEAKER_01\n actually That is true for them, but it means that you're going to get a bunch of different levels of resolution in your survey And it'll be more of a pain later. So somebody's gonna be a circle one depends\n\n0:19:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Right, so you could say what regions do you grow up in from these years and have a set of circle six or seven circles\n\n0:19:14\tSPEAKER_01\n But if you may have it totally freeform Yeah, first of all some people post-processing well, and some people will give you more specific Information than others, and that's a waste because you can only use the least common denominator of specimens\n\n0:19:26\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, but that the good thing about is it frees you from coming up with exactly what the right categories are\n\n0:19:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Right, I don't know later on if somebody just says midwest now all these other people who said you know area Then that'll have to become your category and it's harder later on I'm sure it's easier for the person, but it's harder for the it actually less informative for us because you can't enforce any minimum level of specificity\n\n0:19:55\tSPEAKER_05\n But I think that if you're going to have it be general So the idea again was you know you would also know if they grew up in Germany or if they grew up And so I think you want to The idea the motivation I think for this being suggested before was that it did cover a range of these cases that might You know if you say United language was was English, but you you grew up in Germany\n\n0:20:22\tSPEAKER_07\n Yeah, there is actually you made me think about another wrinkle in this whole thing Which is that just asking them where they grew up between certain ages isn't enough because Somebody could grow up in Germany, but live on an army base speaking English or someone could grow their parents\n\n0:20:36\tSPEAKER_00\n New York and have any number of different types of yeah\n\n0:20:40\tSPEAKER_07\n So you sort of have to say what languages were spoken in the home between the ages of well\n\n0:20:45\tSPEAKER_00\n We have to so he hasn't given you the overview But you have like the native speaker category the non-native speaker category and then you have other language influences For example pylangle dialects things like that. Oh, that's nice issue of not what like you're saying You don't want the forms to be hugely complicated and take half the meeting complete So it's trying to if there's is trying to try to hold this balance between the amount of information needed and You know not taking too much meeting time and then in addition add to a third level of the balance This this issue of not being too intrusive\n\n0:21:18\tSPEAKER_01\n If we release this corpus what do we want? I mean if you do this pre-form The pre-formed solution where some questions are very open-ended Then you need someone needs to enter that and there'll be notes and it'll be very difficult for somebody later to actually use that without\n\n0:21:35\tSPEAKER_00\n It's okay It's not all pre-form we have several categories that are specifically constrained and in terms of the more open ones We have the we're in the unbeatable position of having the contact information and also knowing most of the people Will be participating in the meeting day we can find it we can resolve certain issues later\n\n0:21:54\tSPEAKER_01\n You yeah, I guess what you really want is if there's some information you want to know so we want some rough idea of their dialect basically Then we should have some question where it's not pre-form except for these people who are Who have Non-American English accents there we probably have to have a category non-American English and then a few choices And we should have something That's simple that people can circle like these timet regions or something so that we have something That minimally you can because a lot of times if you give the data out that's what people are gonna use they're gonna want some small side of Places and then but anything additional people can fill out and we can put it in as a note or something But if we don't have that someone's gonna sit there and figure out You know I've got 20 people who said Midwest and I've got a few people who said something else and these don't overlap or I mean I think that we're going a little bit in the circle\n\n0:22:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Because I like the timet suggestion very much and I think it's a question of how to incorporate it and we've already suggested I mean it's come up in this discussion that the suggestion that we could have the timet categories for the American and and then oh, okay, yes or not as to whether we do it for British I mean we sort of discussed one way or the other and it doesn't matter to me I don't know Adam has preference, but we could have you know set the subcategorization for American We could even use the timet subcategorization I don't know if it has one for British or whatever But you know just to have it you know a short simple form that you can categorize yourself\n\n0:23:26\tSPEAKER_05\n In a systematic way what about the phrasing that Turk used which was In the question I was trying to formulate of Where did you what what language was spoken in the language was spoken? Yeah, so it's not where did you grow up?\n\n0:23:46\tSPEAKER_05\n But what language was spoken in the home between the ages of well would be five and 12 or something\n\n0:23:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Depends on who you ask what the influences the influence of the home is much lower age than that I mean once you go beyond an age five or six then it's the the school influence as well And yeah, so you know in the home is sort of your genetic first level So this is why I you know it starts to get sort of complicated\n\n0:24:12\tSPEAKER_00\n So problem that would be a good question to ask and then you could add a question you know Among your peers\n\n0:24:18\tSPEAKER_05\n Because he does rank a good point about the region not necessarily again if you're a Army base\n\n0:24:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Well the way it's phrased right now. It's clearly asking about language And so what it's trying to get at is what you think you speak now I think that the point is well taken that sometimes people are wrong about what they think they speak But other than having a trained linguist Interview them and ask these very specific questions. I don't see a way around it Because as you said what you're gonna have to say is well list the languages that your parents spoke when you were in home And how good they were at it and how long they spoke it and now list the ones in preschool now list the ones in first grade\n\n0:24:55\tSPEAKER_07\n Now list the ones your friends sort of like as soon as you get to the cases on the edge the complexity just shoots that right\n\n0:25:00\tSPEAKER_02\n So I want to try to keep the complexity so that so we can fill out this form at the beginning of a meeting without taking\n\n0:25:07\tSPEAKER_00\n 45 minutes\n\n0:25:18\tSPEAKER_02\n So I think that adding the the timid categories is a good idea because that's very easy for a person to fill out But I think we still have this problem of Is it going to be a self evaluation or are we going to ask them What was it when you were four years old or what was it when you were six years old or what what's the best way of raising the question?\n\n0:25:36\tSPEAKER_07\n Well, you know the other thing too is that Seems like the one of the reasons you would gather Real detailed information about their native languages If you're going to do fine-grained phonetic analysis or something and I don't\n\n0:25:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Somebody might or adaptate for a while. That's what I was going to ask is that Those people don't rely on the self evaluations anyway. They'll probably listen to the speech\n\n0:25:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, I was thinking of it at that's a good point But I was thinking they know the reference to the language model issue And I guess it couldn't be done inductively But you have a bunch of say our list dialects\n\n0:26:08\tSPEAKER_01\n But even you know in switchboard I remember looking really carefully at they have information sort of like Tim I don't know how well they're categorized but they had Norseq landing and mid-Atlantic You know Texas was definitely out on I mean most of the people from certain places in the south were from specific Texas locations But other than that you had a huge range of you know people would say Boston They had nothing like what I would call a Boston accent. So it was they're putting down where they lived at the moment\n\n0:26:36\tSPEAKER_07\n They make recordings were made is that why?\n\n0:26:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Rather than where they go. No the question was really geared towards trying to get people's self-evaluation of their dialect region. Channel on a stratification. And for instance you know Minnesota Midwest is totally different than Michigan Midwest which is totally different These were all settled by very different people So it's sort of a general help But I think that anyone who's doing phonetics wouldn't rely on that. They would probably use it as a first So then we probably don't need to find green to permeate Maybe we should just shoot that Make sure about the non-native accents because those are you know But we don't need to be really really specific about the others\n\n0:27:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Well maybe for the native English speakers we shouldn't even ask the region if it's that unreliable\n\n0:27:23\tSPEAKER_01\n I think we should because other databases do It's sort of a political thing and there are some general like you will find more New Yorkers in the New York category But it's not\n\n0:27:36\tSPEAKER_07\n You can't be relied on only\n\n0:27:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Right\n\n0:27:39\tSPEAKER_02\n The other thing also is that I'm asking for the variety of English and I did just put American, British, Indian and other So I didn't put Canadian, Australian and all the other varieties\n\n0:27:48\tSPEAKER_01\n But other is there and people will feel that all of us are okay Yeah, I think that's my village. They all have not one of these. I'm Canadian\n\n0:27:56\tSPEAKER_05\n So internally we have Texas and other\n\n0:27:58\tSPEAKER_02\n So then for the native English speakers we'll do variety of English Regions from the timid labels and another field\n\n0:28:05\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean you can like how LA is totally different I mean you really can't We could ask them for more estimation but I don't think it's yeah, that's what the\n\n0:28:17\tSPEAKER_00\n necessary and the fact that the category was designed to do because I mean you have a bunch of different types of accents in New York You know made a speech in New York as a function of their social groups and their ethnic identifications and their you know There are lots of things that are very doneifiable as You know other other aspects which is why we have this third category So we wanted to certainly distinguish American versus British and other types at that level and then allow people to self-identify their other specific things And then in addition this issue of regions with some sort of time frame for the region because I think that if you live in Massachusetts now versus In childhood and as adolescents So if you list if you're a traditional so region with respect to a time frame is what I would suggest Where did you live? I mean what you said What were you ever?\n\n0:29:10\tSPEAKER_00\n What you were saying to my just now but I think that a time frame on the region We used to instead of region now say it's a little bit unbounded\n\n0:29:18\tSPEAKER_05\n Um, so are you suggesting that you put something in about childhood?\n\n0:29:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, you know there's this issue of what age is relevant for the formation of your speech patterns whatever they are\n\n0:29:29\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, you could distinguish between pre-5 and 5 to 12 right? So depending on whether someone's interest was in the formation of the phonetic kinds of Categories or whether or whether you're talking more about their Equistics speech patterns, you know So Right again, that's how fine we want to get but we could say uh, where did you live before you were 5?\n\n0:29:53\tSPEAKER_05\n Where did you live after you were 5? I don't know\n\n0:29:55\tSPEAKER_00\n That's interesting from 5 to 15 or something\n\n0:29:59\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, I think the question on regions is really To ask people how do they define their dialect region now the whether they picked it up At the one age or another Pretty much, you know, most people will know whether they have a southern accent or not Um, but they may have lived You know in other places too So if we ask the question about dialect region it makes no sense to say where do you live now?\n\n0:30:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Right, you ask how would you best define your your accent or your dialect?\n\n0:30:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Right the way the form reads now. I think it's pretty clear That's what we're asking because it says native English speakers, variety of English, American, British, Indian, other region And then we'll have southern English, you know, whatever Whatever the timid categories are so I think Or you can look at this form\n\n0:30:44\tSPEAKER_01\n If you look at this form How do you define your the accent that you have?\n\n0:30:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Right And then you can ask these other questions as well But what we don't want them to think is that they're living in a certain place And that therefore they're, I mean, nowadays hardly anybody California is a native California\n\n0:31:00\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't think it was ever the intent to talk about the region now\n\n0:31:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Because Right, I mean so it seems to me that if you read this form Okay It's obvious that it's a subcategory of the language that you think you speak, not where you live I mean, I don't say anything about where you live on the form So it's just in the section talking about language\n\n0:31:20\tSPEAKER_05\n Why don't we try it out? See what kind of responses we get from people\n\n0:31:24\tSPEAKER_02\n And then as Jane said, the last question is, list other language influences by Languld dialects etc And that's just an open-ended place for them to do That's good And then the bottom of the form is for not for them to fill out But for us to fill out for the eglies and database, speaker database that the person is in Since we'll eventually anonymize and this will be a place for us to connect the two And then the meetings that they attended Because they'll be one form for each person\n\n0:31:54\tSPEAKER_01\n That was good, I agree with you\n\n0:31:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, so Yeah, I guess I'll fiddle around yet again with the language stuff\n\n0:32:04\tSPEAKER_07\n I don't think you really have to do all that much\n\n0:32:08\tSPEAKER_01\n It gets into a can of worms and the more you ask the more you realize that You're not getting great answers to what you're asking\n\n0:32:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, you didn't really talk about the non-English speaker categories\n\n0:32:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Right, so there's another area which is non-native English speakers Which asks for native language, region, and variety of English And that's it\n\n0:32:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Because it used to be that Germans would learn British English And now I think there is a certain percentage of them moving\n\n0:32:32\tSPEAKER_01\n What about proficiency in English? A chance for proficiency, that's a good idea\n\n0:32:36\tSPEAKER_00\n That's hard though, I self-identification\n\n0:32:40\tSPEAKER_01\n You don't want to do it for political reasons I wasn't thinking about that, I was thinking\n\n0:32:44\tSPEAKER_05\n I'd like to know actually No, no, I wasn't thinking of political at all I was just saying looking at applications of people over the years for postdocs here They're generally not very good at assessing their own abilities\n\n0:32:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, do you think that's also because they know that It's important for them to be good at it So don't you think they overrate rather than underrate?\n\n0:33:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes So, no, I think proficiency is actually a good thing to have on this sort of work The question are, what would the categories be?\n\n0:33:14\tSPEAKER_00\n I wanted to read it back to training How many years did you study English?\n\n0:33:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Or, you know, have you lived in the American, in an English country before?\n\n0:33:22\tSPEAKER_00\n But it seems like that's so, I mean, I think that, you know, person...\n\n0:33:28\tSPEAKER_01\n What about something like how comfortable are you in a meeting conducted in English?\n\n0:33:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Or how easy is it for you or something like that?\n\n0:33:36\tSPEAKER_05\n How about how long have you been in an English-speaking country?\n\n0:33:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that's a different one Something, what do you think?\n\n0:33:46\tSPEAKER_01\n It's just how long you've been in an English-speaking country Yeah, how long you've been in an English-speaking country?\n\n0:33:52\tNone\n Okay That's non-threatening and it's also a good-dedigare And there were people who have never lived in an English-speaking country in our superb However, that's, you know...\n\n0:34:04\tSPEAKER_07\n And there will be people who live in an English-speaking country But all their meetings are held in another language\n\n0:34:10\tSPEAKER_00\n That's true too, or even, you know, some people just change their meetings\n\n0:34:12\tSPEAKER_07\n I don't know, you guys are companies\n\n0:34:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Being totally monolingual, I'm not the right person to ask to talk about this But it just seems to me that that doesn't...\n\n0:34:20\tSPEAKER_02\n The length of time doesn't really get at what we're asking Right, it seems to me that asking about the proficiency even if it's self-rated Is what we want to know\n\n0:34:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Except that you have so many biasing factors You have people who are highly confident when they really should be a little bit less confident And then you have other people who are just the reverse And it's so many things at very high And also, I want to keep it simple and non-evaluative\n\n0:34:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay You got it?\n\n0:34:48\tSPEAKER_02\n With that form Well, the show we wait for other forms later You got it, what's the other form?\n\n0:34:54\tSPEAKER_02\n The other form is a modified digits form And this one's pretty simple It's very much like the digits forms in front of us Except it doesn't ask for sex or native language So it's name, email, time date, seat, session, mic number, channel, mic type\n\n0:35:12\tNone\n Why do we need that much information? Why do we need the email address? In case people have the same name\n\n0:35:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, I see And can you be on it?\n\n0:35:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Have the same name Oh, I'm particularly sensitive to this because a good friend of mine in In Seattle, his name is Scott Smith and there were 14 of them in at Boeing So the only, so...\n\n0:35:34\tSPEAKER_02\n We could drop email, I mean that's not a big deal\n\n0:35:36\tSPEAKER_00\n It's an interesting identifier I know that I realized the answer to the reason for it\n\n0:35:40\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, the other thing is that potentially if this is done over a period of time someone's email could change\n\n0:35:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Right Well, the other way I was thinking about was assigning them an ID But I hate it when people do that to me when they say here's your ID, don't forget it Oh yeah, that's bad So I want to just something that would give us a hint of who the person is If the name field isn't readable or if it's a duplicate Is it just mother birthday?\n\n0:36:02\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know I mean, not exactly a year\n\n0:36:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Your mother's maiden name Not a year, but just their birth date\n\n0:36:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Mother's maiden name, I don't know, what is it? Social security number\n\n0:36:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Social security number So although the email will change, I think that's a good way of doing it We'll be able to backtrack from email I'm going to have to find an identifier And then the other thing I was thinking about And it probably wouldn't be on the digits form But it's something that Some form about the individual meeting Now the problem I have with that is I don't know who would be filling it out\n\n0:36:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, Matt, I think someone internal to the meeting could do after the fact And this would, and we discussed this This was referenced as like a DTD Well, you would put the DTD, this meeting specific So and it could be something like oh by the way The guy giving the presentation today Is the student of the professor who, whatever So speaker A is his professor And he's preparing for his calls Or some such thing like that Or it could be, you know, so and so and so and so or a marriage Just to pick up an arbitrary an example This wouldn't be relevant all the time But you know if there's a big discussion on you know the best way to move house Then and these people are talking a whole lot Then it might be interesting information to say Well, by the way they're married Or I don't mean\n\n0:37:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Right, so the sorts of questions I had were one Who's going to fill it out and who's going to take responsibility for filling it out In each meeting? Will you will we require it?\n\n0:37:34\tSPEAKER_00\n I would tend to leave that spontaneous I think at the stage of scanning the transcripts after they've been produced by by on the end At that point I think that some of these dynamics will appear to be important And you could you could spend a lot of time in numbering all the different relationships that people have\n\n0:37:52\tSPEAKER_02\n And that was my other question which is what sort of information do we want to record? I mean so I think heroized relationships are pretty easy You know source destination relation Are there other sorts of things that might we might want to record?\n\n0:38:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Well I was just thinking with reference to things that have the bear on the content or the status relations Would be the things without being exhaustive By any means but just like I said there's a certain topic that comes up in the meeting And that knowing their relationship will clarify it or if there's certain dynamic that comes up So I mean person is asked a whole bunch of questions more than you usually think they be asked And it turns out it's because he's being prepared for a job interviewer Right, then it's useful to know that that relationship\n\n0:38:36\tSPEAKER_02\n I think that fits in well with the whole meeting mapping meetings concept Is that's another way of looking at it So are there anything other than pair wise?\n\n0:38:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh well yeah you could have people who are all part of the same football league group\n\n0:38:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh yeah okay So isn't this an open ended like basically a notes column?\n\n0:38:58\tSPEAKER_01\n And you should be able always to attach some notes or something Yes sure, is this the place where we do that or is there another?\n\n0:39:06\tSPEAKER_02\n It seems to me that there is we could attach more structure if we wanted to Especially because a lot of these relationships are pair wise power relationships\n\n0:39:14\tSPEAKER_05\n Maybe I was missing something I mean this is something when we try to infer But how would you freeze that information about what the...\n\n0:39:24\tSPEAKER_05\n I mean we already have these things about someone's a professor or someone's a student or something But would you...\n\n0:39:30\tSPEAKER_05\n Would you...\n\n0:39:32\tSPEAKER_05\n Some person would be writing okay this person was leading the meeting and that was...\n\n0:39:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Or is that what you mean?\n\n0:39:38\tSPEAKER_05\n Or what?\n\n0:39:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Just as an example it would be source Adam Janon destination Morgan relationship advisor\n\n0:39:44\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh so just putting pre-existing relationships that are...\n\n0:39:50\tSPEAKER_01\n That are a lot of things There's definitely some clear cases but there are a lot of gray areas Where the context happens just in that meeting or...\n\n0:40:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Where you don't want to sort of have to make a distinction between a pre-existing A real message for this person\n\n0:40:12\tSPEAKER_00\n The idea was this would be meaning specific Otherwise they would...\n\n0:40:18\tSPEAKER_01\n There are some generalize over many meetings and then there are some that don't So my example was not a good one\n\n0:40:24\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah because that's... So I mean for today for instance this is second meeting record today First meeting was a front end meeting And that one the basic form of that was I was the leader And I was saying what are the results you've gotten last week And one person was sort of taking the lead In describing what the results were And then Chuck was taking the role of saying well what did you mean by this?\n\n0:40:48\tSPEAKER_05\n It was sort of like the out semi outside or asking curiosity questions And then would come back to me with saying well you showed me that But you know I think you should do this in the future So it was very much sort of leader and lead sort of a relationship And the guy I was primarily doing this with is a visiting researcher In this meeting you were my graduate student But it's nothing that kind of roll at all And you're actually leading the meeting for the most part\n\n0:41:20\tSPEAKER_02\n It's just my turn\n\n0:41:22\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah well whatever So yeah so I don't know so you should just think\n\n0:41:28\tSPEAKER_01\n This one is the open-ended, completely open-ended And the only concern I would have is if there's something we want to be able to say and we can't\n\n0:41:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Put it in that field You're the expert from the DTDs\n\n0:41:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Well the DTDs mean we can do whatever however we want it But what I was thinking the reason that I didn't want to make it completely open-ended is it does seem like there is some structure which is common Especially with these pair-wise ones where you can describe them and it's pair-wise And you might want a tool that used that information\n\n0:42:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Is there a way that we can add keywords or sub, I don't know what you would call them But little labels for things that we decide are useful things to have Sure As long as we have this one place where it can all be stored then we're fine I think Right because it seems like it's sort of a...\n\n0:42:16\tSPEAKER_01\n I heard me to ask if you have some other research or we'll think of some totally different Exactly, sort of a research question\n\n0:42:22\tSPEAKER_05\n Is your analyzing the meeting and you're deciding\n\n0:42:24\tSPEAKER_01\n There's this kind of structure to it I'm going to change and maybe we want to regroup things under different labels later\n\n0:42:30\tSPEAKER_02\n If we figure out that these pair-wise things are... Being in a common organization was one I hadn't thought of that so your football league was a good one So the ones I've been thinking of are all sort of power, responsibility I guess husband and wife has yet another one\n\n0:42:46\tNone\n And so in discourse and access to get things like the role You have a role in relationships and it has to do with your negotiating How you're perceived and how you're doing So they're very things you negotiate and I'm wondering if we might be able to do it in sort of a loose way But by having a searchable field like role And then within this context this person has the following roles And it could be very loose but then it'd be possible to do something as simple as a grab across a database And if you're interested in which ones this person serves as an advisor and versus a whatever leader, speaker, whatever, you could just grab for role and some of that sort of particular value\n\n0:43:30\tSPEAKER_05\n So it sounds like having a facility is great and then over a period of time as the research happens And this we might develop some more of these categories that would be generally useful And it sounds like a good thing to do\n\n0:43:40\tSPEAKER_00\n And system one ties also maybe the encoding of them as we find some are useful and some are not so useful\n\n0:43:46\tSPEAKER_02\n So what I have right now is all pairwise so that's probably not sufficient\n\n0:43:50\tSPEAKER_00\n I think you don't need to have that instruction built in Maybe not Yeah, maybe not\n\n0:43:56\tSPEAKER_07\n All of the meetings that have been recorded so far that without this will somebody go back and fill that in or we just won't have it\n\n0:44:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Well I think that in a lot of the meetings people won't be filling this out anyway So really what I want to have is a place that if a researcher wants that information they can add it\n\n0:44:12\tSPEAKER_05\n So the meetings that we have are recorded with roughly this group Right And a fair minority with the group that we have in the morning so this is not a lot of people\n\n0:44:26\tSPEAKER_02\n So it's just a couple other meetings that So it wouldn't be that hard?\n\n0:44:30\tSPEAKER_02\n We can regenerate a lot of this information But even if we can't generate it I think it's all right to have some of the sections in your database blank And this information was not collected for this meeting And there's just not going to be a way around that that's just going to happen Like the NSA meeting, the network's meeting I don't think they're going to want to fill out that information So Okay, enough on forms\n\n0:44:58\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, so we're running kind of late So we're probably going to zip through some other things and maybe do some more time on those A stuff later Status transcription, I guess we recently woke up our friends And so I guess you've sent off the CD rounds and you got some response from IBM about\n\n0:45:26\tSPEAKER_02\n They haven't received them yet but I did get a response from them saying yes we're still alive We haven't done anything yet basically Yeah\n\n0:45:34\tSPEAKER_05\n Is there some suggestion that they might soon?\n\n0:45:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, so they transferred the responsibilities to someone else I can't remember his name\n\n0:45:42\tNone\n McQuend McQuend, something like that And so he sent me email and said he's going to be starting to work on it And I haven't received anything else\n\n0:45:50\tSPEAKER_06\n Great, okay, what was that one?\n\n0:45:52\tSPEAKER_02\n So tomorrow I'll send an email and just ask as you just received He should be getting it today Actually you should have gotten it yesterday but give them a day\n\n0:46:02\tSPEAKER_05\n And I think we should just sort of look at this thing from you flying those A Because it's going to get kind of late but I think the bottom line disclancing through it Is that there's a lot of overlap in just energy related things And you need something else, I mean it's sort of Right And so I had that error that the\n\n0:46:22\tNone\n Resistual error No, the supposed bug That was that we were guessing you had a bug before because You went through and you concatenated all of these things I found the error\n\n0:46:32\tSPEAKER_04\n And I repeat this, put him in here If you confine the new results Okay, so this is the post bug fix\n\n0:46:40\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, so I had two thoughts just glancing through this One is that That We might want to talk about normalization I mean I don't know what normalization So sometimes things have more overlap before you've done Some kind of normalization And I think about what different kinds of normalizations are possible And the other thing is that if that isn't So much of the issue then probably I mean residual LPC energy and just plain energy Are very closely related You know they're different And so really May need to go to something that looks at in some sense Or Relationship to or fit to pitch tracks on either side of it for instance You know so if there's a really bad fit Between where the pitch is going in this supposed Hypothesized region of overlap And the and one or the other side\n\n0:47:50\tSPEAKER_04\n And that's my suggestion in the truck in a way Actually, you mean that I understand that you mean to study the alteration Between the tracking of the pitch If we compare the overlapping sound with the speaker sound\n\n0:48:12\tSPEAKER_05\n If you have two If you have two people speaking And there's an overlap then I mean first thing is that there should be a mixture of harmonics During overlap voice sections anyway And the any a measure that you have of how much of the energy is due to your best Guest at a particular harmonic sequence It's also going to be a smaller fraction This is related to hominicity sort of thing And then the other thing I'm saying is if you look at the temporal evolution of the pitch there should be something like a discontinuity there Now there's other places where you'll have discontinuities in pitch and speech But maybe it'll have something of a different character But it seems like energy tells you something But if in less this is a normalization problem it looks for your results like There's so much overlap that certainly you need something that isn't energy like In addition to it\n\n0:49:13\tSPEAKER_04\n Are the things that are normally inside the indistinguishments by the moment\n\n0:49:17\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't normally size Okay so the question is would some kind of normalization help You know it could be that if you normalize by the overall energy For you know some some longer period of time or something That there would be more of a distinction I don't know\n\n0:49:43\tSPEAKER_07\n So from from these charts I'm just trying to remember where we were But you were interested in finding out if you can tell the difference between Overlapped and single speakers by looking at the energy Like say for example the mean of the energy was that idea?\n\n0:49:59\tSPEAKER_07\n Okay so if you look at on this page it has frame energy You look at the mean for the overlap that's 44.62 Versus the mean for the speakers 39.62 So there seems to be more energy when there's overlapping which is the intuition\n\n0:50:13\tSPEAKER_05\n Unfortunately there's a standard deviation of like 10\n\n0:50:17\tSPEAKER_04\n So the position is pretty much the same\n\n0:50:19\tSPEAKER_01\n But are we assuming that you could Know the energy for a speaker when there's no overlap?\n\n0:50:27\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean can imagine model where you say okay I'm gonna give myself it's cheating but not completely if they're often not overlapping And normalize for the speaker or is that not allowed?\n\n0:50:41\tSPEAKER_05\n Well that's what I was suggesting You want to do some kind of longer time normalization And with the even if you make a mistake occasionally That is roughly is there some corresponding to that speaker So that if you if if if you Because that's going to spread out these distributions really a lot to not do any kind of normalization So that that could mask the effect\n\n0:51:07\tSPEAKER_07\n So the just one more clarifying question on the overlap category Is that overlapping of speakers only?\n\n0:51:15\tSPEAKER_07\n It doesn't include some of the other sounds Okay that's why it's getting overlapped in some\n\n0:51:21\tSPEAKER_04\n That's overlap between two three four is speaker\n\n0:51:25\tSPEAKER_02\n And is this from the mix signal? Okay so there is some normalization already in that they've been volume equalized Right over the entire signal\n\n0:51:35\tSPEAKER_01\n That's what makes it difficult because you're already left with a highest inner deviation And they're already roughly so that each person's hereable Right sort of equally loud Right\n\n0:51:51\tSPEAKER_00\n What about doing just the single terms?\n\n0:51:55\tSPEAKER_04\n Sorry What about these?\n\n0:51:59\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm thinking so there is a question about the fact that if you use the mix signal\n\n0:52:07\tSPEAKER_04\n I usually use the mix signal without non-humanization\n\n0:52:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Well the mix signal already has a normalization in it\n\n0:52:15\tSPEAKER_00\n So what I'm wondering is what about doing some of this with the single channel?\n\n0:52:19\tSPEAKER_04\n I don't study the single channel yet I think it will be worse right? I think the mix?\n\n0:52:31\tSPEAKER_05\n This is frame energy Of course frame frames have a lot of variance to them because different sounds are different So I mean what if you took one second jumps or something like that Or maybe not in the second maybe a quarter second or something so that you would typically have two or three Basically so about that\n\n0:52:51\tSPEAKER_01\n So about 200 ml is like 20-25 frames\n\n0:52:53\tSPEAKER_05\n So we do it You'll having window So I mean 200-300-400 Some longer chunk of time And then you looked at the amount of energy in that And how does that vary over these different cases?\n\n0:53:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Or a voice reason Can we tell?\n\n0:53:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Is it known whether something's voiced here or roughly estimateable?\n\n0:53:17\tSPEAKER_05\n You could do a first determined that something was voiced here\n\n0:53:21\tSPEAKER_01\n If one speaker's voicing and the other one isn't and they're overlapping Do we know that the first speaker's voicing or not?\n\n0:53:29\tSPEAKER_05\n Well I mean the overlaps are typically more than just a tiny bit of time And so there could be voicing and on voiced pieces during the overlap\n\n0:53:37\tSPEAKER_01\n But will we be able to detect the voicing when there's overlap?\n\n0:53:43\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't know because it's\n\n0:53:45\tSPEAKER_01\n So if we could This has to do with these questions of harmonies and so forth Then voiced regions would be probably more informative\n\n0:53:53\tSPEAKER_05\n For energy if we could Right so you could do something like And pitch for that Sure but I think it would be easy for him to do Would be to do this thing over a large amount of region of time Because if you look at a large amount of region of time Most of the time it will have some voiced The fair amount of voiced energy in it And so I think that would be\n\n0:54:11\tSPEAKER_02\n And he has his graph something like 40% It'll look like 50% or more Our 0.2 seconds are longer overlap I think the last page He's a new\n\n0:54:25\tSPEAKER_04\n A new the opposite of the question No he's a full-upping song There was it\n\n0:54:33\tSPEAKER_05\n It was one of the tables What? How'd you find?\n\n0:54:37\tSPEAKER_05\n Are you using a pitch detector in the theater in here?\n\n0:54:39\tSPEAKER_05\n Do you have a pitch detector that you're using?\n\n0:54:41\tSPEAKER_05\n No Do you have a pitch detector that you're using?\n\n0:54:45\tSPEAKER_05\n I am working on it\n\n0:54:47\tSPEAKER_04\n With pitch test Working on it I have a resurgent I'm 70 I am prepared I am prepared in the pitch tracking Big tracker all over That I have\n\n0:55:05\tSPEAKER_05\n Does it have a voiced-on-voiced detector in it? No It doesn't It just finds the pitch even when it's on-voiced I mean it must have something\n\n0:55:15\tSPEAKER_01\n It has to tell you It has to tell you something\n\n0:55:19\tSPEAKER_04\n It's basically the only other coalition Between the theater and this I don't know what this Because it's not my melody\n\n0:55:31\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah so ordinarily these things It does tell you that it's It's voiced with a pitch of such and such And it will say something like zero Or you know it will have something that it says When it's when it can't find a good Good period So it's looking for some periodic behavior If it can't find a period it tells you For most things like that So I mean this is a gang back to what Liz was suggesting which I think actually is good I think that For normalization you could do something like Take voice sections Normalize to equalize energy And that I'm just still going back to normalization That even though it's roughly normalized For overall gain I think it it may not be normalized enough\n\n0:56:15\tSPEAKER_04\n For both For the free energy and the Resilio al-era Rebisi energy For both Yeah And like this Different normalization I will explain them the most as you can\n\n0:56:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay so I think I mean this is something to experimentally determine But I mean if As I understand it you have You have some regions that Are marked as you have training data That you're trying to find a threshold Right and so If you take All the things all the Speak things marked s p k And look for the voiced energy in them And well just in each case Take a take a frame Take the if it's if it's voiced Included just just separate out From the from the normal things separate voice Right then you're going to end up with a Mean standard deviation and so forth And then do your normalization based on that And once you do that just for voiced I guess you\n\n0:57:43\tSPEAKER_01\n You can also look at just the voiced regions Later I mean that would be the most sensitive measure Because you know if you're normalizing for voiced And then you look at regions that are voiced With the same robustness in estimation of what voicing is You should be much more sensitive to the To the overlaps than if you you know if you normalize But you look everywhere at Frickatives or something you won't really know anything So I mean assuming if it's true that the overlap regions are sort of long enough That there's some voicing in each of them by each of the speakers Then you should do very well if you do this But you'll only know that in the voiced regions But those are close enough to the You know there's enough voicing going on and off That if you can capture the voicing And if you can capture it when there's overlap Then you should do quite well There\n\n0:58:43\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm wondering about if there I suppose this is still just that one That one data symbol right that one meeting But it seems like to have it seems like a very hard test to have It be looking at the energy of all the speakers combined Rather than taking you know maybe two extreme speakers out of the mix And seeing if it's promising with respect to that type of analysis Yeah It's like a target speaker and maybe well I think there's enough data Maybe two target speakers and then comparing that to the mixture of all speakers You could do that\n\n0:59:17\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, I mean and if they still overlap But I think that this is a good first thing to just sort of see And what this says is that without any special normalization At least there's a lot of overlap here And so I mean coming back to this question It's still this issue of how much time I mean what do you look at in order to normalize I mean you get some data and you don't know what it is How do you what period of time do you look over to normalize it And that's something to think about experiment\n\n0:59:55\tSPEAKER_01\n I think also the harmonics would be very important So if you can find voice regions and if you have two speakers And they're both voicing unless they have very similar You know pitch you should be able to see the difference in harmonics Right so that's what I thought was more with harmonics And so even if you're not exactly sure when the overlap starts and ends Because there's some non-boist regions At least you can have these islands of reliability\n\n1:00:23\tSPEAKER_02\n It seems like with the overlap being fairly long That should make it easier\n\n1:00:29\tSPEAKER_01\n That was an interesting statistic But an estimate that they were much longer than the previous ones\n\n1:00:33\tSPEAKER_02\n The positive start and end 90% of them are over 200 milliseconds\n\n1:00:37\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah It's a problem to the data\n\n1:00:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Well it's sort of good though It is good for your accuracy It's a problem to try to detect it\n\n1:00:47\tSPEAKER_04\n It's a problem to identify and to the data to With the heavier system for example Yes, for example It's a problem Yeah What happened with the different context Because you are talking about the period of duration of the window To the long of the window to consider normalization Yeah and I will have different context The period, the length of the window to normalize the energy Is in the context of the overlapping song Is in the left context In the right context considering these frames You mean?\n\n1:01:43\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't know I didn't want to just pop out the answer Because I realized I hadn't thought about it\n\n1:01:49\tSPEAKER_04\n 200 milliseconds having We have different context Yeah, something Different situation\n\n1:01:57\tSPEAKER_07\n Just out of accuracy, what was the bug What was the bug that you found\n\n1:02:01\tSPEAKER_04\n What the bug from last? The bug The bug was the F-seq function You see?\n\n1:02:09\tSPEAKER_04\n Because that's a work When you try to do a direct access To a file, a big file Moving the heat in the hardis Forward and backward A lot of time In the moment, F-seq function That's a work\n\n1:02:33\tSPEAKER_00\n And I don't give you any answers\n\n1:02:35\tSPEAKER_04\n It's incredible I do the same thing in another way And I have a problem\n\n1:02:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Did you type Cast to Long Or Size T or whatever it is I don't remember what it is One of the problems if the file is large And you're cast to the wrong type\n\n1:02:53\tSPEAKER_04\n I don't know, but I think the position in the file Doesn't work In a long file\n\n1:03:03\tSPEAKER_05\n What he's saying is a type casting could be the issue\n\n1:03:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Right, if you're sending it an integer instead of a long\n\n1:03:09\tSPEAKER_04\n Type Cast\n\n1:03:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Type Cast from integer int I-n-t or long Or unsigned\n\n1:03:17\tSPEAKER_04\n Long I think it's Same\n\n1:03:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, well, it's one possibility\n\n1:03:25\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, because I think in generancy works\n\n1:03:29\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, no, but I solve the problem with a similar way I have a problem, but I don't know because It doesn't happen to me before I have the same code in different parts I had to change all the points in the code To substitute\n\n1:03:57\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, well, we're missing snacks here So we did it Let's do our digits\n\n1:04:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Digit form 1871-1890 546-890-786 760-870-740-8 906-3036-145-41-21-370-4870-905-5-6-7-930-026-03-1980-323-234\n\n1:04:39\tSPEAKER_05\n Transcript 223-1-225-0 8-9-0-0-151-2514-006-3811-6-01-47-5978-2-6087106-7070-765-930-026-06-6218-210-8 8-9-1-8...\n\n1:05:13\tSPEAKER_05\n 8-7-8-8-7-636-308-4-0?\n\n1:05:18\tSPEAKER_05\n 8-9-1-6...\n\n1:05:22\tSPEAKER_07\n Transcript 2211-2230.\n\n1:05:28\tSPEAKER_07\n 70284-808-6712-014-0305680-1708-27892-34509-7117-8226.\n\n1:05:50\tSPEAKER_07\n 829-7669-0101-205-Strike that.\n\n1:06:01\tSPEAKER_07\n 20355-699-4580-539-87156667723439.\n\n1:06:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Transcript 1951-1970-8908-908-001398-275-218-1559-3473-1052-505151-677917-027-061929-34072-6326-768-83044.\n\n1:06:43\tSPEAKER_04\n Transcript 1911-1930.\n\n1:06:49\tSPEAKER_04\n 8374-936-04089-051-19974-2304-5384-62729-7348-569-7408-569-477-910-0152-330.\n\n1:07:17\tSPEAKER_04\n 23516-344-2-569-3.\n\n1:07:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Transcript 1891-1910-6129-78564-8457010-9092-01048232-31130.\n\n1:07:46\tSPEAKER_00\n 4398-515-583-678-907-4-0246-122438245.\n\n1:08:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, we're done.\n\n1:08:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes?\n\n1:08:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n1:08:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n1:08:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, we are going off.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "SPEAKER, JOSE and Jane have sent in the NSF pre proposal for the speaker form.
