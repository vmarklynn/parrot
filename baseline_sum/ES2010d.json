Is it going to be a single or a double?\n\n0:02:46\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a single, single, single.\n\n0:02:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Single sounds good, because it's not big enough to really constitute it at double.\n\n0:02:52\tSPEAKER_00\n It's only actually the size of my hand.\n\n0:02:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Great.\n\n0:02:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Great. I think you did an awesome job.\n\n0:02:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I think it's beautiful.\n\n0:02:58\tSPEAKER_01\n It is beautiful.\n\n0:02:59\tSPEAKER_01\n And it's everything that we discussed.\n\n0:03:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:03:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Good job, you guys.\n\n0:03:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Good job, you guys.\n\n0:03:03\tSPEAKER_01\n That's really good.\n\n0:03:04\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:03:06\tSPEAKER_01\n What's next in our agenda?\n\n0:03:12\tSPEAKER_01\n We're going to discuss the evaluation criteria.\n\n0:03:16\tSPEAKER_01\n That's with Courtney.\n\n0:03:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:03:18\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a PowerPoint presentation.\n\n0:03:20\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't really know exactly what we should talk about.\n\n0:03:23\tSPEAKER_02\n It's under evaluation.\n\n0:03:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:03:31\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:03:33\tSPEAKER_02\n So these are the criteria we're going to ask.\n\n0:03:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Is it easy to use? Is it fashionable?\n\n0:03:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah. I guess we should write these down.\n\n0:03:42\tSPEAKER_03\n So we can reference them.\n\n0:03:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Feel good, meaning what?\n\n0:03:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Like, does it feel good?\n\n0:03:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Fisably.\n\n0:03:55\tNone\n Yeah, basically.\n\n0:04:05\tSPEAKER_02\n That's just for current trends.\n\n0:04:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:04:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Because I'm really telling you guys.\n\n0:04:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it's a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it.\n\n0:04:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:04:22\tSPEAKER_02\n But so we do have removable covers, right?\n\n0:04:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:04:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah. Well, then that's correct.\n\n0:04:26\tSPEAKER_02\n And so we can, everybody have that?\n\n0:04:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Are we?\n\n0:04:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, she's got it.\n\n0:04:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:04:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:04:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay. So we're using the criteria for a PowerPoint scale.\n\n0:04:44\tSPEAKER_02\n And so we need to discuss how we feel.\n\n0:04:48\tSPEAKER_02\n It falls within this range.\n\n0:04:50\tSPEAKER_02\n So for easy to use.\n\n0:04:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Do we feel it's very easy to use?\n\n0:04:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Are we going to use this?\n\n0:04:55\tSPEAKER_01\n I say we individually, right?\n\n0:04:56\tSPEAKER_01\n What do you guys think?\n\n0:04:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Just orally.\n\n0:04:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Why not?\n\n0:04:59\tSPEAKER_01\n We have.\n\n0:05:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:05:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Easy to use.\n\n0:05:03\tSPEAKER_01\n I vote six.\n\n0:05:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Wait, that's false.\n\n0:05:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh!\n\n0:05:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Two.\n\n0:05:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:05:09\tSPEAKER_00\n I'd say two as well.\n\n0:05:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, two.\n\n0:05:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Two.\n\n0:05:12\tSPEAKER_02\n So I say, hello.\n\n0:05:13\tSPEAKER_02\n We're great.\n\n0:05:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, fashionable.\n\n0:05:15\tSPEAKER_02\n At the moment?\n\n0:05:16\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:05:17\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:05:18\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, no.\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's very pretty.\n\n0:05:20\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a little very chic.\n\n0:05:21\tSPEAKER_02\n I would give it a one.\n\n0:05:22\tSPEAKER_02\n One.\n\n0:05:23\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll give it a two, because at the moment it's not looking that way.\n\n0:05:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, that's just like protein.\n\n0:05:27\tSPEAKER_02\n That's a clay.\n\n0:05:28\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a very type.\n\n0:05:29\tSPEAKER_03\n What do you think?\n\n0:05:30\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know if that's a lot.\n\n0:05:31\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll give it like three or four.\n\n0:05:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:05:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:05:35\tSPEAKER_01\n So the average is about a two.\n\n0:05:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, two or three.\n\n0:05:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Two point five.\n\n0:05:39\tSPEAKER_02\n That's okay.\n\n0:05:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:41\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll go along.\n\n0:05:42\tSPEAKER_00\n All the customers we have.\n\n0:05:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Does it feel good?\n\n0:05:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Imagine.\n\n0:05:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Since we obviously don't have that.\n\n0:05:46\tSPEAKER_01\n I feel like.\n\n0:05:47\tSPEAKER_01\n The shape of it actually does.\n\n0:05:49\tSPEAKER_01\n And it's, it is very ergonomically designed.\n\n0:05:53\tSPEAKER_01\n It's going to be curved.\n\n0:05:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that's going to be flickering.\n\n0:05:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:57\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it feels good.\n\n0:05:58\tSPEAKER_02\n I think so too.\n\n0:05:59\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll give it a two.\n\n0:06:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:06:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Two.\n\n0:06:02\tSPEAKER_01\n I'll give it a one.\n\n0:06:03\tSPEAKER_01\n What do you say?\n\n0:06:04\tNone\n I'd say two.\n\n0:06:05\tNone\n All right.\n\n0:06:06\tSPEAKER_00\n I can have your two.\n\n0:06:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Is it technologically innovative?\n\n0:06:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, sorry.\n\n0:06:09\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm taking a rejabit.\n\n0:06:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh no, it's fine.\n\n0:06:11\tSPEAKER_01\n You already had it.\n\n0:06:12\tSPEAKER_01\n You're a project manager.\n\n0:06:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Does it have a voice?\n\n0:06:15\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, the phrase recognition on it.\n\n0:06:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:06:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:06:25\tSPEAKER_01\n We were able to do it with that kind of chip.\n\n0:06:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, right.\n\n0:06:28\tSPEAKER_00\n We could do it with the chip, yes.\n\n0:06:30\tSPEAKER_00\n It wasn't.\n\n0:06:31\tSPEAKER_00\n We had no reflection of it on the prototype.\n\n0:06:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:34\tSPEAKER_00\n But that's because it's only two dimensions.\n\n0:06:36\tSPEAKER_00\n And we discussed that.\n\n0:06:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:38\tSPEAKER_02\n So then, yes, then I would.\n\n0:06:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, it doesn't.\n\n0:06:42\tSPEAKER_02\n What else wouldn't need to be technologically innovative?\n\n0:06:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we don't have the, you know, we can't say channel.\n\n0:06:47\tSPEAKER_01\n It changes the channel.\n\n0:06:48\tSPEAKER_02\n And it doesn't cover anything else in TV.\n\n0:06:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:06:51\tSPEAKER_02\n So I'd probably give it a three.\n\n0:06:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:06:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Even though it is for just a TV or more, it's very advanced.\n\n0:06:57\tSPEAKER_02\n But it is just a TV or not.\n\n0:07:00\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:01\tSPEAKER_01\n I go for a three or four on that one.\n\n0:07:03\tSPEAKER_01\n So.\n\n0:07:04\tSPEAKER_01\n I go four.\n\n0:07:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:07:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Let's go for a three.\n\n0:07:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Three.\n\n0:07:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Three.\n\n0:07:09\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:07:10\tSPEAKER_01\n And the last criteria.\n\n0:07:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Is it, is it squishy on the fruity?\n\n0:07:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we've covered that with these.\n\n0:07:15\tSPEAKER_01\n We'll try and do you guys.\n\n0:07:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:17\tSPEAKER_02\n So I'd give it a two.\n\n0:07:20\tSPEAKER_00\n It's capable of being squishy.\n\n0:07:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, it's very, very squishy.\n\n0:07:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Very, very squishy.\n\n0:07:23\tSPEAKER_02\n It's very important.\n\n0:07:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:07:25\tSPEAKER_01\n And it's very important.\n\n0:07:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:07:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Here we go.\n\n0:07:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:07:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Next.\n\n0:07:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Next.\n\n0:07:32\tSPEAKER_02\n So our model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be winner.\n\n0:07:37\tSPEAKER_02\n And hopefully we'll sell millions.\n\n0:07:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Good job, team.\n\n0:07:41\tSPEAKER_00\n How did you get that in there?\n\n0:07:43\tSPEAKER_00\n What?\n\n0:07:44\tSPEAKER_00\n It's slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie.\n\n0:07:47\tSPEAKER_00\n It does.\n\n0:07:48\tSPEAKER_01\n It's almost good.\n\n0:07:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Thank you.\n\n0:07:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Very good.\n\n0:07:51\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:07:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Let's go back to this.\n\n0:07:55\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:07:56\tSPEAKER_01\n That's it.\n\n0:08:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Oops.\n\n0:08:05\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:08:07\tSPEAKER_01\n So now we're moving on to finance.\n\n0:08:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:08:11\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm going to show you an Excel spreadsheet.\n\n0:08:13\tSPEAKER_01\n And we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under 1250 euro.\n\n0:08:20\tSPEAKER_01\n If so, we can proceed.\n\n0:08:22\tSPEAKER_01\n If not, we need to go back to the drum board a little bit.\n\n0:08:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:08:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Let me bring that up.\n\n0:08:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Here we go.\n\n0:08:31\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:08:33\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not a hand-on mode.\n\n0:08:35\tSPEAKER_01\n It's powered by battery.\n\n0:08:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Yep.\n\n0:08:37\tSPEAKER_01\n So we give it a two number of components you plan to use.\n\n0:08:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Did I just put quantity being one battery or?\n\n0:08:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:08:48\tSPEAKER_01\n But if it's a, do you want to go for, this is where we need to make the final call.\n\n0:08:51\tSPEAKER_01\n If it's a lithium or you want to go triple A's.\n\n0:08:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Because triple A's we're going to have to do more than one battery.\n\n0:08:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, let's just go for a lithium.\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_01\n What are you saying?\n\n0:08:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:59\tSPEAKER_01\n It's still lithium.\n\n0:09:00\tSPEAKER_01\n I think we're going to be able to purchase this.\n\n0:09:02\tSPEAKER_01\n We're going to be technically advanced.\n\n0:09:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:09:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:06\tSPEAKER_01\n We're going to be like electronics section.\n\n0:09:09\tSPEAKER_01\n We're going to need this kind of correct to do the voice sensor.\n\n0:09:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:13\tSPEAKER_01\n So one of those.\n\n0:09:14\tSPEAKER_01\n It is a single curve.\n\n0:09:16\tSPEAKER_01\n So one of those.\n\n0:09:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh.\n\n0:09:19\tSPEAKER_01\n What's that?\n\n0:09:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that's correct.\n\n0:09:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:09:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Down here.\n\n0:09:23\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a little bit more specific.\n\n0:09:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Plastic.\n\n0:09:25\tSPEAKER_01\n And special color.\n\n0:09:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:09:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Down here, interface type.\n\n0:09:31\tSPEAKER_01\n We're going to have the integrated scroll.\n\n0:09:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Scroll.\n\n0:09:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, that's a push button too right there.\n\n0:09:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_00\n So integrated scroll wheel or push button.\n\n0:09:42\tSPEAKER_00\n We're really having just push button interface.\n\n0:09:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:09:45\tSPEAKER_01\n So we can just go.\n\n0:09:47\tSPEAKER_02\n But will we actually will need to want we want for the top and then one for this one eat for each side.\n\n0:09:53\tSPEAKER_00\n But that just covers the type of button we're having.\n\n0:09:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Because we're not doing a scroll on the side.\n\n0:09:58\tSPEAKER_00\n It's still push button.\n\n0:10:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Like that.\n\n0:10:03\tSPEAKER_03\n 29 means like you have both scrolls and push button.\n\n0:10:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:10:06\tSPEAKER_02\n I think she's I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put like here because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not going to be on the same plane when you press the button.\n\n0:10:14\tSPEAKER_02\n There's no have to be additional signals on the
