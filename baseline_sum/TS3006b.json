They do need to be under remote control. If you can't control the sound settings, if you dislike a very loud bass or something you need to change that.\n\n0:05:40\tSPEAKER_01\n We can't leave them away. Most relevant and most use functions. They speak for themselves. I guess power button, channel volume, selection, and sound. I can skip that because I saw the new slash. I have not used any more in the future.\n\n0:06:07\tSPEAKER_01\n I forgot this one. Channel setting. For programming your channels in the right order.\n\n0:06:22\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a text file in the project folder. There was some research on new features in remote control about an LCD screen and speed track of nation.\n\n0:06:39\tSPEAKER_01\n We got an update for the audience or the targeted group. It's about 40, I guess. The new product or below you.\n\n0:06:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Because that's pretty relevant. I thought I read.\n\n0:06:54\tSPEAKER_02\n The new product should be below 40. That's in the news.\n\n0:07:09\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a clear distinction between the age groups concerning the features. People are not so interested in the screen or speed track of nation.\n\n0:07:28\tSPEAKER_01\n We can skip this part as well. I thought I read above 40, so we could skip the features. We just have to build them in because they find it very interesting.\n\n0:07:43\tSPEAKER_01\n We have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible. Also, not only the design of the buttons, but also how you can push them.\n\n0:08:02\tSPEAKER_01\n I think for the lower age groups, it's a nice design. It doesn't make you remote control on the stage of your room. It's a part of your interior.\n\n0:08:21\tSPEAKER_01\n The logo has to be present and the color.\n\n0:08:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Most of the time there is a brand present on it. That's not going to affect it very much. But that's the consequence of marketing part.\n\n0:08:54\tSPEAKER_00\n We can select it or use it outdoor.\n\n0:09:12\tSPEAKER_00\n I love the taste and its fun.\n\n0:09:19\tSPEAKER_00\n No, no, no, no.\n\n0:09:19\tSPEAKER_00\n I press the mouse button.\n\n0:09:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, great.\n\n0:09:22\tSPEAKER_03\n That's the self-destruct button.\n\n0:09:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe you can do it from your computer.\n\n0:09:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:28\tSPEAKER_00\n So this will all go.\n\n0:09:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Stand around here.\n\n0:09:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Sure.\n\n0:09:32\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:09:33\tSPEAKER_02\n And this noise.\n\n0:09:38\tSPEAKER_00\n The fact that you did it.\n\n0:09:40\tSPEAKER_00\n All right.\n\n0:09:41\tSPEAKER_00\n I had two examples.\n\n0:09:45\tSPEAKER_00\n This one is the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons.\n\n0:09:50\tSPEAKER_00\n This is the easy one.\n\n0:09:51\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we have to combine them and merge the best functions of our examples.\n\n0:09:59\tSPEAKER_00\n But the H is under 40.\n\n0:10:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:03\tSPEAKER_01\n And one thing research stated that kind of users are not afraid of a lot of functions.\n\n0:10:09\tSPEAKER_00\n So we have to also not too much.\n\n0:10:11\tSPEAKER_00\n But yeah.\n\n0:10:15\tSPEAKER_03\n We do have to integrate the screen and the speaker.\n\n0:10:18\tSPEAKER_03\n That's a nice recommendation.\n\n0:10:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:20\tSPEAKER_00\n All right.\n\n0:10:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:22\tSPEAKER_00\n This one we can remove for kids.\n\n0:10:24\tSPEAKER_00\n It's just only for adults.\n\n0:10:25\tSPEAKER_00\n So we can use some advanced options.\n\n0:10:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:28\tSPEAKER_00\n From age of 16.\n\n0:10:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:30\tSPEAKER_00\n But I prefer we use the basic options.\n\n0:10:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:33\tSPEAKER_00\n We have to make them very easy.\n\n0:10:35\tSPEAKER_00\n So for just zapping around channels, you can just push one button.\n\n0:10:39\tSPEAKER_00\n But if you want to use your video record or something else, you should use an advanced option.\n\n0:10:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:46\tSPEAKER_01\n But the new flash also stated that it should control only one device, only your television.\n\n0:10:52\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:52\tNone\n OK.\n\n0:10:52\tSPEAKER_00\n So it's very easy.\n\n0:10:54\tSPEAKER_01\n So there are not extra options in this case.\n\n0:10:57\tSPEAKER_00\n And also, yeah.\n\n0:10:59\tSPEAKER_00\n We have to make it fashionable, you know, set before.\n\n0:11:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, the basic functions only use the extra functions if they are really needed.\n\n0:11:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:09\tSPEAKER_02\n So maybe you can hide that most of the time.\n\n0:11:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, what we can do with the screen is all the configuration options you can put that in the screen.\n\n0:11:16\tSPEAKER_00\n And that.\n\n0:11:17\tSPEAKER_00\n And the screen menu.\n\n0:11:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, screen menu to do that.\n\n0:11:21\tSPEAKER_01\n And then the basic function just under device itself.\n\n0:11:24\tSPEAKER_01\n So it looks very simple.\n\n0:11:25\tSPEAKER_01\n And all the advanced features are hidden in the screen.\n\n0:11:28\tSPEAKER_02\n With a clear menu.\n\n0:11:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Frinctionality is the screen.\n\n0:11:32\tSPEAKER_02\n What does the screen do?\n\n0:11:35\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:11:36\tSPEAKER_02\n What are the handbrakes?\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Low on power.\n\n0:11:40\tSPEAKER_01\n What are they?\n\n0:11:41\tSPEAKER_02\n So what does the screen do?\n\n0:11:43\tSPEAKER_02\n They said they needed it.\n\n0:11:44\tSPEAKER_02\n What does it do?\n\n0:11:45\tSPEAKER_02\n What do they want with this?\n\n0:11:46\tSPEAKER_00\n For the advanced functions, I think.\n\n0:11:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, it didn't say what they want to do with the screen.\n\n0:11:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I guess it's pretty handy for advanced functions.\n\n0:11:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Like searching for channels programming them.\n\n0:12:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Nevermind.\n\n0:12:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Go back to work.\n\n0:12:04\tSPEAKER_00\n That's, I'm almost finished.\n\n0:12:08\tSPEAKER_00\n OK.\n\n0:12:10\tSPEAKER_00\n We have to watch out for the, if we make it a very fashionable, that the functionality will go down.\n\n0:12:18\tSPEAKER_00\n So we have to make a compromise between functionality and fashion, fashion, content, and form.\n\n0:12:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Now that was it.\n\n0:12:27\tSPEAKER_00\n That was it.\n\n0:12:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:28\tSPEAKER_03\n OK.\n\n0:12:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, my presentation is a bit sucky.\n\n0:12:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, you can improvise, right?\n\n0:12:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, a little bit.\n\n0:12:39\tSPEAKER_03\n No.\n\n0:12:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Functional requirements?\n\n0:12:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I think that would be it.\n\n0:12:48\tSPEAKER_03\n No.\n\n0:12:49\tSPEAKER_01\n So we can go for it.\n\n0:12:51\tSPEAKER_03\n That was, you know, you know.\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Let me check.\n\n0:12:55\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not really English.\n\n0:12:56\tSPEAKER_03\n I know.\n\n0:13:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, working zone.\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Got it.\n\n0:13:04\tSPEAKER_01\n So we can go for the look I feel of the left example, and then a screen on top of it.\n\n0:13:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Here you go.\n\n0:13:13\tSPEAKER_03\n All right.\n\n0:13:14\tSPEAKER_03\n How do I skip pages?\n\n0:13:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Just the press the keys.\n\n0:13:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:19\tSPEAKER_03\n All right.\n\n0:13:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, well, I was working on this before I got my information.\n\n0:13:25\tSPEAKER_03\n So I was just working off the top of my head using my common knowledge about remote controls.\n\n0:13:33\tSPEAKER_03\n And well, the info on the website, which came to it.\n\n0:13:37\tSPEAKER_03\n And so I didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet.\n\n0:13:43\tSPEAKER_03\n So this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last meeting.\n\n0:13:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Those were my starting points.\n\n0:13:54\tSPEAKER_03\n I was working on a schedule, and I was supposed to do it like this.\n\n0:14:02\tSPEAKER_03\n But the information came, and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow.\n\n0:14:11\tSPEAKER_03\n So I was trying to organize them for myself and then make the design, the actual design, but I never came around to do that.\n\n0:14:22\tSPEAKER_03\n So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about it.\n\n0:14:26\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, everything speaks for itself, I guess.\n\n0:14:29\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, you press a button, it sends a signal to a chip, which translates it into infrared signal of certain spatial frequencies.\n\n0:14:42\tSPEAKER_03\n And our temporal frequencies, actually.\n\n0:14:45\tSPEAKER_03\n And then through a transformer, the signal gets boosted and then sent to the receiver on the TV, and it if you translate it into a function.\n\n0:15:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, well, this was actually all I got around to do.\n\n0:15:08\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, I don't know if I'm too slow for this stuff.\n\n0:15:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Work harder.\n\n0:15:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Should make a list of all the functions we want to add.\n\n0:15:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, we want to incorporate into it.\n\n0:15:21\tSPEAKER_02\n OK, for those that didn't see it yet, the basic new requirements of the management were no temp text, only for TV.\n\n0:15:34\tSPEAKER_02\n It should be designed for a used group below 40, but I don't think it's wrong if we can target the current customer group as well.\n\n0:15:44\tSPEAKER_02\n And the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control.\n\n0:15:51\tSPEAKER_02\n And we have to decide on the functions and on the target group.\n\n0:16:01\tSPEAKER_02\n We have to make me clear what that is.\n\n0:16:04\tSPEAKER_01\n The target group of users?\n\n0:16:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, users.\n\n0:16:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Because it says below 40.\n\n0:16:08\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, I guess that's a target.\n\n0:16:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it's our male and female.\n\n0:16:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, six.\n\n0:16:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, below 40.\n\n0:16:16\tSPEAKER_01\n So the marketing research started on the age of 16, 16 to 25, 25 to 35, 35 to 45, something like that.\n\n0:16:25\tSPEAKER_02\n So below 40 is OK, but we need a lower level, which is to see.\n\n0:16:33\tSPEAKER_02\n How do you miss?\n\n0:16:34\tSPEAKER_02\n So from 16 to 40, is it from 20 to 40?\n\n0:16:38\tSPEAKER_01\n 16 to 40.\n\n0:16:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:41\tSPEAKER_01\n I guess people of 16 are quite used to technology.\n\n0:16:46\tSPEAKER_01\n So they adapted pretty soon, I guess.\n\n0:16:48\tSPEAKER_00\n If we have a larger public, we have more options to sell our product.\n\n0:16:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, so what we might want to do is have customized the screen functions.\n\n0:16:59\tSPEAKER_03\n If you know what I mean, younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines.\n\n0:17:07\tSPEAKER_03\n So they can use more advanced functions, but maybe elderly people don't understand it so well.\n\n0:17:13\tSPEAKER_03\n So they need a simpler remote.\n\n0:17:15\tSPEAKER_03\n And yeah, that you can choose what the design displays are.\n\n0:17:20\tSPEAKER_00\n That's right.\n\n0:17:21\tSPEAKER_00\n I wanted to make two different groups of functions, the simple functions for the whole public.\n\n0:17:29\tSPEAKER_00\n And the advanced options for the younger people who are more experienced.\n\n0:17:35\tSPEAKER_01\n But all incorporated in the screen are just on the remote itself.\n\n0:17:40\tSPEAKER_00\n I should put the extra advanced options on the screen display.\n\n0:17:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, like you have a visual of the brightness with a sliding bar and a bus and stuff like that for sound and visuals.\n\n0:17:54\tSPEAKER_02\n So you should have a menu for all the...\n\n0:17:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Make a regular, which you make it drawing.\n\n0:18:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that's too...\n\n0:18:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Shall I?\n\n0:18:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Ah, like so big.\n\n0:18:12\tSPEAKER_01\n I thought it was very big.\n\n0:18:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, yeah, it's okay.\n\n0:18:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:20\tSPEAKER_02\n You don't have long controls, so...\n\n0:18:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, we get there.\n\n0:18:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, well, this is basically...\n\n0:18:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Alright, remote.\n\n0:18:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Usually the power button is on top, I guess.\n\n0:18:38\tSPEAKER_02\n You should be easily reached with the thumb.\n\n0:18:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, so it should fit right into your hands.\n\n0:18:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:18:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Right, most people are right-handed, so maybe left hand is a special dish, but okay.\n\n0:18:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Should it like here or something?\n\n0:19:00\tSPEAKER_01\n There you can put a screen like on a mobile phone, also on top, I guess.\n\n0:19:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but if you are using the normal functions, the basic functions, you normally do it with the thumb.\n\n0:19:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:13\tSPEAKER_02\n So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your thumb also reach the middle or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly.\n\n0:19:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, so you have it in your hand and the screen is below and the buttons are in the middle.\n\n0:19:30\tSPEAKER_01\n For example, if you put the screen here, it's more about the functions now than the layout.\n\n0:19:36\tSPEAKER_01\n It doesn't work too well, it's a spend.\n\n0:19:39\tSPEAKER_02\n I can help it.\n\n0:19:41\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:19:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:19:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:19:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, you get it.\n\n0:19:53\tSPEAKER_01\n For example, if you put all the...\n\n0:19:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:20:03\tSPEAKER_02\n It was a normal piece of paper, and this is a pen.\n\n0:20:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, my pen is not good.\n\n0:20:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Kind of works.\n\n0:20:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Like if you have like ten buttons for all the channels and here one for flipping.\n\n0:20:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that's usually like here, here, here, here.\n\n0:20:33\tSPEAKER_01\n So you have up and down for the channels, left and right for the volume.\n\n0:20:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Those can also be used for the menu.\n\n0:20:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n0:20:45\tSPEAKER_03\n But this is really your department that we need just the functional display.\n\n0:20:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:50\tSPEAKER_01\n For a cursor, if you can use the most of the time you have one button in the middle, it says menu.\n\n0:20:55\tSPEAKER_01\n And then if you press it, the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into a function.\n\n0:21:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Most of the time this menu button is also like okay to confirm a kind of action.\n\n0:21:11\tSPEAKER_01\n So you scroll into it, okay, you select the function like base.\n\n0:21:17\tSPEAKER_01\n You just adjust it with these two buttons.\n\n0:21:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Then okay to confirm and then on each screen, this you've been option to go back to an upper level.\n\n0:21:30\tSPEAKER_01\n And finally say okay, exit or one button to exit it in one time.\n\n0:21:35\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know that's not really my department.\n\n0:21:38\tSPEAKER_01\n That's more your department to to a logo or remote control.\n\n0:21:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be on top.\n\n0:21:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I mean, it's okay.\n\n0:21:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but it depends on where you put the screen.\n\n0:21:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it's essential that there is a screen.\n\n0:21:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I mean the position of the screen is also more essential than...\n\n0:21:59\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there.\n\n0:22:04\tSPEAKER_02\n For the speech recognition part, if you want to incorporate that, we need to microphone.\n\n0:22:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, so it should be, I mean if you have your hand here, it should be on top somewhere.\n\n0:22:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Why do we want to put the display in the bottom?\n\n0:22:19\tSPEAKER_01\n That's not sure, but it's new to display.\n\n0:22:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Because if you use the functions your hand will block the display.\n\n0:22:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, okay, but that's only for the basic function.\n\n0:22:31\tSPEAKER_00\n If you are going to use the headphones, you are going to press the menu button.\n\n0:22:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I mean, the screen on top looks more normal.\n\n0:22:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Logical to me also because people use mobile phones and they also have the screen on top.\n\n0:22:46\tSPEAKER_01\n So you just have to reach a little bit for the power button.\n\n0:22:51\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, if you grab it...\n\n0:22:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Most of the times, if TV is on standby, people just press the channel.\n\n0:22:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Can we put it on top?\n\n0:22:59\tSPEAKER_01\n So we put this on top and then make the corporate logo like over here, RR.\n\n0:23:06\tSPEAKER_01\n And the microphone, I mean, it can be very small if you look at your mobile phones.\n\n0:23:11\tSPEAKER_01\n These are some stripes, little holes.\n\n0:23:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe on the top or even on the side?\n\n0:23:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, maybe on the side.\n\n0:23:19\tSPEAKER_02\n If the microphone is good...\n\n0:23:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, okay, so on the top is better.\n\n0:23:25\tSPEAKER_03\n But if you hold the remote like this, if you put it on the top on the side, I don't know.\n\n0:23:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, it should be able to...\n\n0:23:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it does.\n\n0:23:34\tSPEAKER_02\n It does on the sensitivity of the microphone.\n\n0:23:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, we'll leave this up to you.\n\n0:23:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it doesn't matter that much.\n\n0:23:40\tSPEAKER_01\n So, what I'm the screen is on top, and which functions did we have left?\n\n0:23:46\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, this is basically numbers.\n\n0:23:49\tSPEAKER_01\n For you.\n\n0:23:50\tSPEAKER_02\n So, the panel up and down, the screen is over there.\n\n0:23:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe we should decide what the advanced options we want to put in the LCD screen.\n\n0:24:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that's a good one.\n\n0:24:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, so we needed to integrate those sound and image options, right?\n\n0:24:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, based sound.\n\n0:24:12\tSPEAKER_03\n So we need kind of an equalizer.\n\n0:24:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Equalizer.\n\n0:24:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, so we need to have a sound.\n\n0:24:20\tSPEAKER_01\n But not too advanced.\n\n0:24:22\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, most TVs use only treble and bass.\n\n0:24:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, treble and middle bass, or something.\n\n0:24:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it's pretty hard to write.\n\n0:24:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, but you have sound?\n\n0:24:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, sounds.\n\n0:24:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, just...\n\n0:24:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, you have a digital better writer down over there, yeah.\n\n0:24:40\tSPEAKER_01\n So you have sound?\n\n0:24:41\tSPEAKER_01\n It's secret tape.\n\n0:24:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, sound.\n\n0:24:47\tSPEAKER_01\n And then within sound, I guess, treble and bass.\n\n0:24:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, the mono stereo option.\n\n0:24:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:56\tSPEAKER_03\n And also...\n\n0:24:57\tSPEAKER_03\n There was something else also.\n\n0:24:58\tSPEAKER_03\n And then...\n\n0:24:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Pitch.\n\n0:25:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Pitch.\n\n0:25:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but pitch isn't that...\n\n0:25:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that's the height.\n\n0:25:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, the frequency is the tone.\n\n0:25:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:25:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Why would you use that?\n\n0:25:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, isn't this.\n\n0:25:10\tSPEAKER_03\n It depends on the signal of the program you're watching.\n\n0:25:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:15\tSPEAKER_02\n And also the tuning part?\n\n0:25:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Programming part.\n\n0:25:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, programming.\n\n0:25:20\tSPEAKER_01\n A channel programming.\n\n0:25:22\tSPEAKER_01\n So we have sound?\n\n0:25:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, channel programming.\n\n0:25:25\tSPEAKER_03\n And...\n\n0:25:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, in the functionality of the...\n\n0:25:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Telefusion.\n\n0:25:29\tSPEAKER_03\n No, no, of the remote.\n\n0:25:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Do we want the buttons to make sound when you press them?\n\n0:25:36\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a confirmation.\n\n0:25:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Or whatever, you know?\n\n0:25:39\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it gets annoying.\n\n0:25:41\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, most mobile phones use that in the beginning, but...\n\n0:25:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Under the...\n\n0:25:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, yeah, advanced option.\n\n0:25:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, you can put that thing.\n\n0:25:49\tSPEAKER_00\n The television itself has also the options with brightness and screen color, etc.\n\n0:25:56\tSPEAKER_00\n So contrast.\n\n0:25:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but people don't want to sit underneath, underneath the front of the television, which is usually only three buttons.\n\n0:26:05\tSPEAKER_01\n And it's very hard to...\n\n0:26:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Contrast.\n\n0:26:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, contrast and brightness.\n\n0:26:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, those are the most used, I guess, if you don't get your monitor...\n\n0:26:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, yeah, well, I guess that this word only wants, I guess.\n\n0:26:20\tSPEAKER_01\n It's easy.\n\n0:26:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:22\tSPEAKER_01\n But so we have...\n\n0:26:23\tSPEAKER_03\n We have TV options, which is all this.\n\n0:26:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, the sound options.\n\n0:26:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Sound and image.\n\n0:26:27\tSPEAKER_03\n And you have in it that...\n\n0:26:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Indeed.\n\n0:26:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Indeed, the remote control options.\n\n0:26:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:35\tSPEAKER_03\n You need two menus kind of thing.\n\n0:26:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, you have basically a button menu, which you can use directly, according to the old press pull and the LCD options are activated based on some software options that communicate with the infrared.\n\n0:26:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, with the chip and then translate, I mean.\n\n0:26:56\tSPEAKER_02\n So yeah.\n\n0:26:57\tSPEAKER_02\n You have an additional processor.\n\n0:26:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Well...\n\n0:27:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, we have power button, whether that's present, channel volume selection present, numbers present.\n\n0:27:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, audio settings, monastery, repeats, based treble, screen settings, brightness and color.\n\n0:27:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Color.\n\n0:27:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, contrast is...\n\n0:27:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Let me make it cool.\n\n0:27:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, okay, color and brightness.\n\n0:27:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:23\tSPEAKER_01\n And which is a channel setting, so channel programming.\n\n0:27:26\tSPEAKER_01\n So you have an option to start scanning all the frequencies.\n\n0:27:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, not the...\n\n0:27:32\tSPEAKER_01\n And when it encounters one, well, it shows on your TV.\n\n0:27:36\tSPEAKER_01\n And then you can...\n\n0:27:40\tSPEAKER_01\n And then you can select a number in your remote, in which you want to save it.\n\n0:27:44\tSPEAKER_02\n The channel program is auto-seek.\n\n0:27:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, auto-seek.\n\n0:27:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Name the channel.\n\n0:27:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Or...\n\n0:27:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, most TVs automatically display the name, which they get through the cable.\n\n0:28:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, they get the automatic names.\n\n0:28:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, so you only have to choose the position on your...\n\n0:28:07\tSPEAKER_01\n It only has to match the channel frequency on your TV, with the position on your TV.\n\n0:28:13\tSPEAKER_02\n And so your remote.\n\n0:28:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but can you also say I want for a Veronica on the channel number five?\n\n0:28:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, if you want to move it, yeah, that should be possible too.\n\n0:28:23\tSPEAKER_01\n How do you call that?\n\n0:28:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, how do you call that?\n\n0:28:27\tSPEAKER_01\n You should be able to browse through a list or something, which displays all the values, all the channels, which are possible, I mean, like one, two, thirty or four, nine here or whatever, just browse through it and then...\n\n0:28:45\tSPEAKER_01\n In some kind of way, see if it is programmed.\n\n0:28:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Swap channels?\n\n0:28:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Swap channels.\n\n0:28:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Swap is a good option.\n\n0:28:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:28:56\tSPEAKER_01\n So you...\n\n0:28:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Most of the time, if you swap it, let's say for example you have RTL5 on channel five, and Veronica on channel eight, and you want to move it only to channel five.\n\n0:29:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Most of the time, if you overwrite the previous one.\n\n0:29:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, that's...\n\n0:29:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:20\tSPEAKER_01\n It's pretty...\n\n0:29:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I mean, you have to look on the menu.\n\n0:29:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Those are working on the TV.\n\n0:29:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Also.\n\n0:29:29\tSPEAKER_03\n He only has to figure out how that's to look, and how it...\n\n0:29:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but also, which bitons you have to press to get a certain result.\n\n0:29:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:29:42\tSPEAKER_02\n The working design was to specify how the fiscal interaction between the components was, I believe, cheated your homework.\n\n0:29:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Or is it too hard to just do it on your remote to program the channels?\n\n0:29:59\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:30:00\tSPEAKER_03\n It should be able to do a very big thing.\n\n0:30:02\tSPEAKER_02\n The communication with the television is difficult, but that's a hard part.\n\n0:30:07\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:30:09\tSPEAKER_01\n You don't have to design the protocol.\n\n0:30:11\tSPEAKER_01\n That's true.\n\n0:30:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Thank God.\n\n0:30:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:30:16\tSPEAKER_01\n So we have a figure out a way to do that easily.\n\n0:30:18\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, the auto-seq is not a problem.\n\n0:30:20\tSPEAKER_01\n You echo the channel and then it just says, which number do you want to save this?\n\n0:30:26\tSPEAKER_01\n And you just press the number on your remote, and then say confirm, okay, and then it's saved.\n\n0:30:32\tSPEAKER_01\n It's easier if it's harder to, if you have already programmed it, to swap.\n\n0:30:36\tSPEAKER_01\n So we have to think of something for that.\n\n0:30:39\tSPEAKER_02\n The user interface designer can design a menu for all these functions, to put them on the remote.\n\n0:30:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Kind of structure into layers.\n\n0:30:49\tSPEAKER_00\n You make a map with all the, yeah, because it's now, there are lots of documents.\n\n0:30:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I can.\n\n0:30:56\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll just try to reorganize things.\n\n0:31:00\tSPEAKER_02\n So.\n\n0:31:03\tSPEAKER_02\n So you design the basic function menu for the LCD screen.\n\n0:31:14\tSPEAKER_01\n And the layout of the thing itself.\n\n0:31:16\tSPEAKER_02\n I think the layout of the screen, I think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the screen itself on the...\n\n0:31:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Isn't that more than you?\n\n0:31:28\tSPEAKER_00\n This interface.\n\n0:31:29\tSPEAKER_02\n No, I think that's more...\n\n0:31:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Functional aspects of the...\n\n0:31:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe more.\n\n0:31:36\tSPEAKER_03\n I think I am my department.\n\n0:31:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:38\tSPEAKER_03\n I have to know what it has to do.\n\n0:31:40\tSPEAKER_03\n So if you want to, you know, the changing the channels kind of thing is...\n\n0:31:45\tSPEAKER_02\n I have to integrate that into the design.\n\n0:31:47\tSPEAKER_02\n So you can play out your function.\n\n0:31:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, I think that's a good set.\n\n0:31:53\tSPEAKER_00\n I have to, yeah, to make the menu layout also, or...\n\n0:31:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:00\tSPEAKER_01\n I guess so.\n\n0:32:02\tSPEAKER_02\n I think that's your department.\n\n0:32:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:04\tSPEAKER_02\n We have to kind of work together.\n\n0:32:06\tSPEAKER_03\n If I make the...\n\n0:32:09\tSPEAKER_03\n The menu, like...\n\n0:32:12\tSPEAKER_03\n I have to state which function has to be in the menu and then you have to decide it...\n\n0:32:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:17\tSPEAKER_00\n In a way that is your friendly.\n\n0:32:18\tSPEAKER_00\n You are going to make a list of what functions are going to be on the screen.\n\n0:32:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:25\tSPEAKER_00\n And I'm going to make a nice menu.\n\n0:32:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:29\tSPEAKER_01\n With some layers in it.\n\n0:32:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:32\tSPEAKER_02\n And also...\n\n0:32:33\tSPEAKER_02\n So many things.\n\n0:32:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Make clear which buttons to press to get certain results.\n\n0:32:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Because that's always difficult every device at the time.\n\n0:32:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I guess this button, the OK...\n\n0:32:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Menu, OK.\n\n0:32:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Menu, OK.\n\n0:32:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Or you can incorporate two different buttons, like you have on your mobile phone.\n\n0:32:54\tSPEAKER_01\n So this is only for...\n\n0:32:55\tSPEAKER_01\n To get in the menu or to exit it.\n\n0:32:57\tSPEAKER_01\n And then I want to confirm.\n\n0:33:00\tSPEAKER_01\n I want to go one step back.\n\n0:33:03\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's like the say button on your mobile phone if you have a Nokia or like that or the no button.\n\n0:33:09\tSPEAKER_01\n To go one step back.\n\n0:33:11\tSPEAKER_01\n It's only two extra buttons.\n\n0:33:13\tSPEAKER_01\n But if it's very clear that they are for the screen.\n\n0:33:17\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we have to make two groups.\n\n0:33:20\tSPEAKER_00\n One group for the display and one group for the basic functions.\n\n0:33:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but they are incorporated.\n\n0:33:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, because this is used for both.\n\n0:33:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but maybe that's not...\n\n0:33:34\tSPEAKER_00\n If you're stepping with your remote control, you can press the menu button.\n\n0:33:40\tSPEAKER_00\n And then you are suddenly into the...\n\n0:33:43\tSPEAKER_01\n To your screen.\n\n0:33:44\tSPEAKER_01\n OK, so you leave the menu button out of here.\n\n0:33:48\tSPEAKER_01\n And just put it under the screen.\n\n0:33:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Just group... We make these advanced functions and these basic functions.\n\n0:33:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:58\tSPEAKER_00\n We make a line between them.\n\n0:34:02\tSPEAKER_01\n But we should place the screen on top, right?\n\n0:34:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, for...\n\n0:34:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, yeah, OK, yeah, we swap...\n\n0:34:08\tSPEAKER_02\n We put this in the USB port.\n\n0:34:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, so you just find out that the handle will be out.\n\n0:34:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Do we do the extra two buttons or not?\n\n0:34:18\tSPEAKER_03\n I think you should.\n\n0:34:21\tSPEAKER_03\n It's easier if you put too many functions in one button, it gets confusing.\n\n0:34:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:26\tSPEAKER_00\n So we have a menu button and a...\n\n0:34:28\tSPEAKER_02\n It's to OK and back.\n\n0:34:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:31\tSPEAKER_01\n OK and back.\n\n0:34:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, confirm and back.\n\n0:34:33\tSPEAKER_02\n The more arrows...\n\n0:34:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:36\tSPEAKER_02\n But those are still you doubly used.\n\n0:34:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Should we save this picture or, you know, what it looks like?\n\n0:34:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I'm not clear about the extra two buttons.\n\n0:34:45\tSPEAKER_00\n We have a menu button.\n\n0:34:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, just to activate the screen.\n\n0:34:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, OK.\n\n0:34:51\tSPEAKER_02\n So when you built an access to the menu in the LCD screen...\n\n0:34:55\tSPEAKER_01\n And then with these buttons, you can navigate.\n\n0:34:59\tSPEAKER_01\n You navigate.\n\n0:35:00\tSPEAKER_02\n OK.\n\n0:35:01\tSPEAKER_02\n But you can also navigate the channels.\n\n0:35:04\tSPEAKER_00\n OK, so that's not...\n\n0:35:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Those are both multifaceted.\n\n0:35:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Hey, is it interesting for users if we put lead lights under the buttons?\n\n0:35:14\tSPEAKER_03\n And if you press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are...\n\n0:35:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Lid up, yeah.\n\n0:35:24\tSPEAKER_01\n That's a very good idea.\n\n0:35:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Five minutes.\n\n0:35:27\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:35:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that's a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now, which you can use.\n\n0:35:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:34\tSPEAKER_03\n And then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button.\n\n0:35:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, sure.\n\n0:35:39\tSPEAKER_03\n OK.\n\n0:35:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:41\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:35:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Anything else?\n\n0:35:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Those buttons are little, but just one thing.\n\n0:35:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Should we use those two then, or only this two to scroll, and then use the two functional buttons to confirm to go into something?\n\n0:35:57\tSPEAKER_01\n All right, we have to use this to adjust some bars.\n\n0:36:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Keep it optional because maybe you can, you know, go left, right, and up and down.\n\n0:36:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:07\tSPEAKER_01\n And then just use this also as an OK button still, and then just only a back button.\n\n0:36:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, we have those buttons.\n\n0:36:17\tSPEAKER_03\n The problem with the OK button in the middle is sorry.\n\n0:36:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Sorry.\n\n0:36:22\tSPEAKER_03\n If you're pressing up and down, you can easily press the OK when you're not already at your choice.\n\n0:36:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:29\tSPEAKER_00\n So maybe make one OK button...\n\n0:36:31\tSPEAKER_00\n And one back.\n\n0:36:32\tSPEAKER_00\n And one navigation button.\n\n0:36:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, with the channel and the volume, yeah, a multifunctional navigation button.\n\n0:36:40\tSPEAKER_02\n OK, that's what we decided.\n\n0:36:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:43\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:36:44\tSPEAKER_03\n OK.\n\n0:36:45\tSPEAKER_03\n So...\n\n0:36:46\tSPEAKER_02\n You want to close down, huh?\n\n0:36:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I want to close down, too.\n\n0:36:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Sorry.\n\n0:36:49\tSPEAKER_02\n That's a good one.\n\n0:36:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Because you don't like it.\n\n0:36:51\tSPEAKER_02\n But we have a lunch break.\n\n0:36:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Already.\n\n0:36:53\tSPEAKER_02\n And then we can work for 30 minutes.\n\n0:36:55\tSPEAKER_02\n And I have to write very fast to make the mini...\n\n0:36:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:00\tSPEAKER_02\n And we'll see.\n\n0:37:02\tSPEAKER_03\n All right.\n\n0:37:04\tSPEAKER_03\n How long is the lunch break?\n\n0:37:06\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know.\n\n0:37:07\tSPEAKER_02\n We have to write.\n\n0:37:08\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:37:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Do we have to write down our stuff now?\n\n0:37:13\tSPEAKER_00\n First lunch break.\n\n0:37:14\tSPEAKER_00\n I believe that's first lunch break.\n\n0:37:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Everything in my head now.\n\n0:37:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:19\tSPEAKER_00\n You can just...\n\n0:37:21\tSPEAKER_00\n OK.\n\n0:37:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah?\n\n0:37:23\tSPEAKER_00\n OK.\n\n0:37:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:37:25\tSPEAKER_01\n OK.\n\n0:37:27\tSPEAKER_02\n I think you can put the laptop back in the room.\n\n0:37:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, sir.\n\n0:37:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Time pressure.\n\n0:37:34\tSPEAKER_02\n OK.\n\n0:37:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it's a little pressure.\n\n0:37:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Sorry for my...\n\n0:37:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Not finished presentation, huh?\n\n0:37:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Sorry, I'll...\n\n0:37:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, we'll kick your ass later.\n\n0:37:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Bring it on.\n\n0:37:47\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know if it works, but...\n\n0:37:51\tSPEAKER_01\n You saved this?\n\n0:37:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Does it save automatically in the project folder?\n\n0:37:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:56\tSPEAKER_01\n It's...\n\n0:37:57\tNone\n OK.\n\n0:38:00\tSPEAKER_01\n We'll see.\n\n0:38:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Just shoot back in my laptop.\n\n0:38:03\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm going to use it.\n\n0:38:04\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm going to use it.\n\n0:38:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, you can open it with picture preview or stuff like that.\n\n0:38:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Some maps with all the data we...\n\n0:38:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:14\tSPEAKER_02\n I try to organize it by these three.\n\n0:38:17\tSPEAKER_00\n I make use of it.\n\n0:38:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:19\tSPEAKER_00\n It's just my own maps.\n\n0:38:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:21\tSPEAKER_00\n I put everything into it.\n\n0:38:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:23\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't really mind.\n\n0:38:24\tSPEAKER_02\n I just put the menus here.\n\n0:38:26\tSPEAKER_02\n We'll see.\n\n0:38:27\tSPEAKER_00\n But you got some actual information.\n\n0:38:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's in the functional design.\n\n0:38:31\tSPEAKER_02\n OK.\n\n0:38:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it's just basically what I just...\n\n0:38:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Where are the digital data?\n\n0:38:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I got the...\n\n0:38:38\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know the only one.\n\n0:38:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:40\tNone\n OK.\n\n0:38:41\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm blurry.\n\n0:38:42\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't do it.\n\n0:38:43\tSPEAKER_01\n OK.\n\n0:38:44\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:38:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Make me proud.\n\n0:38:52\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll try to.\n\n0:38:53\tSPEAKER_03\n So first we have a lunch break now.\n\n0:38:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:57\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:38:58\tSPEAKER_02\n I believe so.\n\n0:39:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, just...\n\n0:39:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh.\n\n0:39:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Mm-hmm.\n\n0:39:04\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know where she's at though.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "It takes too much time to learn how to use the new remote control.
