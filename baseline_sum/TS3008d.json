Oh, help.\n\n0:11:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Maar je kunt een beetje een hoog in het.\n\n0:11:24\tSPEAKER_03\n In de lille, een lille, een lille productie, die in het.\n\n0:11:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Dat is passant.\n\n0:11:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's talk about the docking station later, want we have to consider the docking station anyway, want we have some cost issues still to come.\n\n0:11:39\tSPEAKER_00\n We have to look.\n\n0:11:40\tSPEAKER_03\n The look and feel would be great on this remote control.\n\n0:11:43\tSPEAKER_03\n We pick up the remote control in the smallest area, then your left term of your right term is near the program button, which is the most common used function.\n\n0:12:01\tSPEAKER_03\n All the other buttons are available for your term.\n\n0:12:05\tSPEAKER_03\n So it's a really good design.\n\n0:12:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Is it?\n\n0:12:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, on the side, there will be a strip of rubber.\n\n0:12:15\tSPEAKER_03\n In the middle, there is a hard material, a hard plastic with a light behind it.\n\n0:12:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:12:25\tSPEAKER_02\n And other lights?\n\n0:12:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, we can make it also in the own lights on it.\n\n0:12:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Or the buttons that can make lights on it.\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe the logo?\n\n0:12:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:12:37\tSPEAKER_03\n But it will also use batteries and we want you.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:12:44\tSPEAKER_00\n For now, this is good enough.\n\n0:12:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:12:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, what was on the, you know,\n\n0:12:50\tSPEAKER_03\n all the aspects of the interface buttons were...\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, but oh yeah, the color, because we're going to use one color for the plastic, and one color for the rubber.\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:13:03\tSPEAKER_00\n And we're going to do the buttons, or we're going to have rubber buttons.\n\n0:13:07\tSPEAKER_00\n And there will be, don't be in the same color as the rubber on the side.\n\n0:13:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I think that would be good.\n\n0:13:12\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we should use a darker color for the plastic and maybe some more brighter and flashier.\n\n0:13:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, maybe we can use on the light on the side.\n\n0:13:21\tSPEAKER_03\n We can use multiple lights.\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_03\n So it will...\n\n0:13:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we'll talk about the lights later.\n\n0:13:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Because it also depends on the costs and such.\n\n0:13:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:34\tSPEAKER_00\n And we have to grill upon the exact colors, but I don't know if that's important, but we'll talk about it later.\n\n0:13:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, for now, this is okay.\n\n0:13:40\tSPEAKER_00\n This is okay.\n\n0:13:42\tSPEAKER_00\n The next...\n\n0:13:43\tSPEAKER_00\n You're going to give a presentation too, or I have to see the...\n\n0:13:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I'm going to do something right there.\n\n0:13:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Detailed design.\n\n0:13:51\tSPEAKER_02\n We've got to do that on the right...\n\n0:13:53\tSPEAKER_02\n the most...\n\n0:13:54\tSPEAKER_02\n the right mouse screen, because...\n\n0:13:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Evaluation criteria.\n\n0:13:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's me.\n\n0:14:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:14:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, all right.\n\n0:14:04\tSPEAKER_02\n I will be needing that image.\n\n0:14:06\tSPEAKER_02\n So, leave it please.\n\n0:14:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Go away.\n\n0:14:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Right, we're going to evaluate that design according to a few points.\n\n0:14:24\tSPEAKER_02\n The four of us are going to do that together.\n\n0:14:30\tSPEAKER_02\n I want to have a color over here.\n\n0:14:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Come on.\n\n0:14:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Right, the remote...\n\n0:14:36\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not ugly, a bit weird sentence, but the positive thing has to be on the left, so I said not ugly instead of ugly.\n\n0:14:45\tSPEAKER_02\n What would you say?\n\n0:14:48\tSPEAKER_02\n We've got to give points to all of these...\n\n0:14:50\tSPEAKER_02\n to evaluate that design, and please forget the drawing skills of these guys.\n\n0:14:58\tSPEAKER_02\n The remote controls are not ugly.\n\n0:15:01\tSPEAKER_02\n How do you feel?\n\n0:15:03\tSPEAKER_00\n I think four maybe would be appropriate, because it's...\n\n0:15:07\tSPEAKER_00\n maybe it really depends on taste.\n\n0:15:09\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, it's kind of dairy-our-design.\n\n0:15:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:15:13\tSPEAKER_00\n So, maybe a lot of people find it really ugly, and other people find it really cool.\n\n0:15:17\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know, or...\n\n0:15:19\tSPEAKER_00\n How do you think?\n\n0:15:20\tSPEAKER_03\n I think the front...\n\n0:15:22\tSPEAKER_03\n The front will give it a more...\n\n0:15:25\tSPEAKER_03\n less, uglier side, because you can make it in your own...\n\n0:15:31\tSPEAKER_03\n The difference in your own...\n\n0:15:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, you can make it in your own...\n\n0:15:34\tSPEAKER_03\n More to your own personality or house style.\n\n0:15:38\tSPEAKER_00\n We didn't...\n\n0:15:39\tSPEAKER_00\n We were not planning to use fronts.\n\n0:15:41\tSPEAKER_00\n No, not fronts, but different designs.\n\n0:15:44\tSPEAKER_02\n And that's still...\n\n0:15:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it's a little personal touch, I guess.\n\n0:15:49\tSPEAKER_00\n No, maybe we should do three or something in our...\n\n0:15:52\tSPEAKER_02\n What would you like to say?\n\n0:15:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Personally.\n\n0:15:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Personally.\n\n0:15:57\tSPEAKER_01\n We can make it a one.\n\n0:15:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, but what is it?\n\n0:16:01\tSPEAKER_03\n I think two or three...\n\n0:16:04\tSPEAKER_03\n No.\n\n0:16:05\tSPEAKER_02\n You don't?\n\n0:16:06\tSPEAKER_01\n I agree.\n\n0:16:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Two or three?\n\n0:16:09\tSPEAKER_01\n I go for the positive, so I go for two.\n\n0:16:13\tSPEAKER_02\n I was thinking about three.\n\n0:16:15\tSPEAKER_00\n I was thinking about four, so I think three is...\n\n0:16:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Three is a bit...\n\n0:16:20\tSPEAKER_02\n How?\n\n0:16:22\tSPEAKER_02\n What am I doing?\n\n0:16:23\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll mark it.\n\n0:16:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Remote controls...\n\n0:16:27\tSPEAKER_02\n And then makes a stepping easy.\n\n0:16:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, let's make it a one.\n\n0:16:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, one.\n\n0:16:33\tSPEAKER_01\n One, thank you, agree?\n\n0:16:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I agree.\n\n0:16:35\tSPEAKER_01\n This one, I think, for sure.\n\n0:16:36\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm not using the ability, so...\n\n0:16:38\tSPEAKER_02\n I totally agree.\n\n0:16:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Remote controls...\n\n0:16:40\tSPEAKER_02\n The remote controls, relevant buttons, are prominently visible.\n\n0:16:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:16:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Two or one, I guess.\n\n0:16:47\tSPEAKER_00\n It's something we really put work into.\n\n0:16:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:50\tSPEAKER_02\n I would say one because...\n\n0:16:52\tSPEAKER_02\n It's all about buttons.\n\n0:16:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Every button is relevant.\n\n0:16:56\tSPEAKER_02\n And they're all...\n\n0:16:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:00\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:17:01\tSPEAKER_02\n That's a one.\n\n0:17:02\tSPEAKER_02\n You agree?\n\n0:17:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:04\tSPEAKER_02\n The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons.\n\n0:17:07\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we totally succeeded there.\n\n0:17:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, maybe a two because of the menu...\n\n0:17:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, maybe not.\n\n0:17:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Also the buttons of the one, the two, the digits...\n\n0:17:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we don't know if they're there.\n\n0:17:19\tSPEAKER_00\n They're used...\n\n0:17:20\tSPEAKER_00\n It's got a point.\n\n0:17:21\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it too.\n\n0:17:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, true.\n\n0:17:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, it's three.\n\n0:17:24\tSPEAKER_00\n It came a long way, but not we didn't.\n\n0:17:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Two.\n\n0:17:27\tSPEAKER_03\n But you can't make a remote control without them.\n\n0:17:31\tSPEAKER_02\n No, that's true.\n\n0:17:32\tSPEAKER_02\n That's true.\n\n0:17:33\tSPEAKER_02\n They're definitely needed.\n\n0:17:34\tSPEAKER_00\n It can also always be more simplistic.\n\n0:17:36\tSPEAKER_00\n We put it on a tool.\n\n0:17:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:17:38\tSPEAKER_02\n The remote control has got a really trendy look.\n\n0:17:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:17:42\tSPEAKER_03\n One.\n\n0:17:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Martin.\n\n0:17:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Well.\n\n0:17:46\tSPEAKER_00\n I think two.\n\n0:17:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n0:17:48\tSPEAKER_00\n It's hard to say from this picture.\n\n0:17:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:51\tSPEAKER_03\n We've tried to make it the best trend you've ever.\n\n0:17:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Ever.\n\n0:17:56\tSPEAKER_02\n He know.\n\n0:17:57\tSPEAKER_00\n But I do think it's more...\n\n0:17:59\tSPEAKER_01\n I'll make it a three because...\n\n0:18:01\tSPEAKER_00\n I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful.\n\n0:18:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I agree.\n\n0:18:05\tSPEAKER_02\n So I think maybe it has to score higher on this than on the...\n\n0:18:08\tSPEAKER_02\n I was planning to give it a two where I give the not ugly...\n\n0:18:11\tSPEAKER_02\n The three.\n\n0:18:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh.\n\n0:18:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:14\tSPEAKER_02\n That's true.\n\n0:18:15\tSPEAKER_02\n You agree or not, too?\n\n0:18:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:17\tSPEAKER_00\n When you compare to that.\n\n0:18:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Great.\n\n0:18:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unlimited buttons.\n\n0:18:24\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a different thing.\n\n0:18:25\tSPEAKER_02\n I can't be that one.\n\n0:18:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, forget that.\n\n0:18:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:18:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Go away.\n\n0:18:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Remote control has got innovative technology implanted.\n\n0:18:38\tSPEAKER_02\n No, no.\n\n0:18:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Where you not.\n\n0:18:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, maybe the LCD.\n\n0:18:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but we're...\n\n0:18:44\tSPEAKER_00\n You don't mean the rubber stuff.\n\n0:18:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, and the light.\n\n0:18:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but the light.\n\n0:18:48\tSPEAKER_00\n That's not innovative.\n\n0:18:50\tSPEAKER_00\n And I don't know if there's also re-not innovative.\n\n0:18:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Light is not...\n\n0:18:53\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not.\n\n0:18:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Seven?\n\n0:18:55\tSPEAKER_00\n No, six.\n\n0:18:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, seven maybe.\n\n0:18:57\tSPEAKER_00\n No, six.\n\n0:18:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Why not seven?\n\n0:18:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Why not seven?\n\n0:19:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Because we've tried to make it a little bit innovative.\n\n0:19:04\tSPEAKER_03\n But how?\n\n0:19:05\tSPEAKER_00\n It depends on the...\n\n0:19:07\tSPEAKER_03\n With the light, it's kind of future...\n\n0:19:09\tSPEAKER_00\n No, I think it's actually seven maybe.\n\n0:19:12\tSPEAKER_00\n But there's nothing innovative about it.\n\n0:19:14\tSPEAKER_02\n It's true.\n\n0:19:15\tSPEAKER_02\n I agree.\n\n0:19:16\tSPEAKER_03\n But still, you can retrieve it when it's gone.\n\n0:19:19\tSPEAKER_03\n With...\n\n0:19:20\tSPEAKER_02\n With generally or...\n\n0:19:22\tSPEAKER_02\n You didn't draw the original form.\n\n0:19:24\tSPEAKER_02\n No, the doggy station is...\n\n0:19:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I mean the doggy station.\n\n0:19:28\tSPEAKER_00\n But I think...\n\n0:19:29\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a part of the remote doggy station.\n\n0:19:31\tSPEAKER_00\n It's going to be a problem.\n\n0:19:33\tSPEAKER_00\n And when the speaker is on the...\n\n0:19:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, let's leave it open for us later to see.\n\n0:19:38\tSPEAKER_00\n But because we have to re-value it anyway.\n\n0:19:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, yeah.\n\n0:19:41\tSPEAKER_02\n No, well, the agenda says it's value-weight now.\n\n0:19:44\tSPEAKER_02\n So I think...\n\n0:19:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, for now it's a six or a seven or a six maybe.\n\n0:19:48\tSPEAKER_00\n But the retrieval or the...\n\n0:19:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but I don't know if it's very...\n\n0:19:52\tSPEAKER_02\n I think that's very innovative for our control.\n\n0:19:55\tSPEAKER_03\n How would you innovate a remote control more?\n\n0:19:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, more through like...\n\n0:20:00\tSPEAKER_00\n TV function add- To put it on your head?\n\n0:20:03\tSPEAKER_00\n No, you know what I mean.\n\n0:20:05\tSPEAKER_00\n You must be innovative technology for remote control more...\n\n0:20:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes, sure.\n\n0:20:09\tSPEAKER_00\n...in how you control stuff, not in how you find your...\n\n0:20:12\tSPEAKER_00\n I definitely don't think it's a five.\n\n0:20:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's think about it later on.\n\n0:20:16\tSPEAKER_02\n The remote control is easy to use.\n\n0:20:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, as a one or a two, at least.\n\n0:20:21\tSPEAKER_02\n I think a two, yeah.\n\n0:20:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it's good.\n\n0:20:25\tSPEAKER_02\n More on.\n\n0:20:26\tSPEAKER_02\n The remote control hasn't got...\n\n0:20:29\tSPEAKER_00\n I want to see that one before.\n\n0:20:31\tSPEAKER_00\n How do you skip one?\n\n0:20:32\tSPEAKER_02\n I've just filled...\n\n0:20:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:35\tSPEAKER_02\n That way.\n\n0:20:36\tSPEAKER_03\n You like the buttons?\n\n0:20:38\tSPEAKER_02\n I've found 12 questions so much, but it's still a...\n\n0:20:41\tSPEAKER_00\n The remote control will be bought by...\n\n0:20:43\tSPEAKER_02\n It will be bought by people under the age of 14.\n\n0:20:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, definitely.\n\n0:20:48\tSPEAKER_03\n In comparing with people of...\n\n0:20:51\tSPEAKER_03\n No, no, no, no, no, just if they buy it.\n\n0:20:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, we don't know.\n\n0:20:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, what do you think?\n\n0:20:57\tSPEAKER_01\n I think too.\n\n0:20:58\tSPEAKER_01\n I think too.\n\n0:20:59\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm not talking too.\n\n0:21:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, too.\n\n0:21:01\tSPEAKER_03\n But only when you compare it with elderly.\n\n0:21:04\tSPEAKER_03\n There's no comparison.\n\n0:21:05\tSPEAKER_00\n There's no comparison.\n\n0:21:06\tSPEAKER_00\n It's just...\n\n0:21:07\tSPEAKER_00\n It will be bought by people under the age of 14.\n\n0:21:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, you can be very...\n\n0:21:12\tSPEAKER_00\n And I don't need to be guessing.\n\n0:21:14\tSPEAKER_00\n I just made it.\n\n0:21:15\tSPEAKER_03\n We'll make it a two.\n\n0:21:17\tSPEAKER_03\n When it succeeds, it can get a two...\n\n0:21:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:21:21\tSPEAKER_02\n The remote control has recognizable corporate image.\n\n0:21:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Color, logo or slogan.\n\n0:21:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n0:21:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Slogan is quite obvious in there.\n\n0:21:32\tSPEAKER_02\n All the slogan?\n\n0:21:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Sorry, no, no, no, no, the slogan.\n\n0:21:35\tSPEAKER_00\n You can put that on the side if we would like.\n\n0:21:38\tSPEAKER_03\n On the next side.\n\n0:21:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Encrypted.\n\n0:21:40\tSPEAKER_03\n And I will...\n\n0:21:42\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm gonna do this.\n\n0:21:43\tSPEAKER_00\n I still think it's gonna be a two or three.\n\n0:21:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe a three this time.\n\n0:21:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Three?\n\n0:21:48\tSPEAKER_02\n I agree.\n\n0:21:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Because of the slogan in there.\n\n0:21:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Remote control's got a basic design intended for no...\n\n0:21:55\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a one or two.\n\n0:21:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Two.\n\n0:21:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Two?\n\n0:21:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, make it two.\n\n0:21:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Two.\n\n0:22:00\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:22:01\tSPEAKER_02\n We've got to add up this course now to see our total average...\n\n0:22:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Four, five, seven, nine.\n\n0:22:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Look at that.\n\n0:22:11\tSPEAKER_02\n 15, 17, 21, 24, 26.\n\n0:22:17\tSPEAKER_02\n 26.\n\n0:22:21\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a 2.6.\n\n0:22:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Not that bad.\n\n0:22:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, that's mostly...\n\n0:22:28\tSPEAKER_00\n When we score higher on innovative technology, we would score it too.\n\n0:22:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Which is quite a great...\n\n0:22:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:22:37\tSPEAKER_00\n This was the evaluation.\n\n0:22:40\tSPEAKER_02\n This was my evaluation.\n\n0:22:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Because I still think that the most important part of this meeting still has...\n\n0:22:44\tSPEAKER_02\n It's pretty nice job.\n\n0:22:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Until now.\n\n0:22:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Is this your...\n\n0:22:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Is this something after this meeting?\n\n0:22:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I think we've got to fill out another question now.\n\n0:22:57\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:22:58\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:05\tSPEAKER_00\n It's still open, do I know?\n\n0:23:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, finance.\n\n0:23:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Because I received a spreadsheet.\n\n0:23:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but I actually don't need this presentation.\n\n0:23:22\tSPEAKER_00\n That's not a matter.\n\n0:23:25\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm going to open the spreadsheet and we're going to work this out together.\n\n0:23:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Because I didn't really finish it.\n\n0:23:36\tSPEAKER_00\n But we will see we'll stumble upon some problems.\n\n0:23:42\tSPEAKER_02\n We'll probably walk.\n\n0:23:44\tSPEAKER_00\n We'll look for it.\n\n0:23:45\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm probably already opened it here.\n\n0:23:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's try it again.\n\n0:23:54\tSPEAKER_00\n First of all, all the docking stations and costs and such are not included in this list.\n\n0:24:04\tSPEAKER_00\n But let's start with the need.\n\n0:24:06\tSPEAKER_00\n We include one battery.\n\n0:24:08\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll explain the components.\n\n0:24:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Our list is over here.\n\n0:24:12\tSPEAKER_00\n The price is given.\n\n0:24:13\tSPEAKER_00\n We...\n\n0:24:14\tSPEAKER_00\n The amount, yeah.\n\n0:24:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we indicate the amount of components.\n\n0:24:18\tSPEAKER_00\n The specific component, how much we need of them.\n\n0:24:21\tSPEAKER_00\n And then, don't watch the number yet.\n\n0:24:24\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know if it's filled in properly.\n\n0:24:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, we need one battery.\n\n0:24:28\tSPEAKER_00\n One battery.\n\n0:24:29\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we're going to use enough.\n\n0:24:31\tSPEAKER_00\n We don't need connectics, solar cells, hand on ammo.\n\n0:24:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, this is the first problem.\n\n0:24:37\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we should know how many simple chips, regular chips...\n\n0:24:43\tSPEAKER_03\n...is one chip, but what you have to choose one for it.\n\n0:24:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:24:49\tSPEAKER_03\n But a simple chip is enough, I think.\n\n0:24:53\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:24:54\tSPEAKER_03\n With the lights in the retrieval, we can be...\n\n0:24:56\tSPEAKER_02\n I haven't got an idea on which we need to use.\n\n0:25:00\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it was your job in the first meet, your first presentation to make this clear.\n\n0:25:08\tSPEAKER_00\n But then you had some time problems.\n\n0:25:10\tSPEAKER_00\n But do you know what chip we need?\n\n0:25:13\tSPEAKER_03\n The email I got said, simple chip, when we put in the speaker and the retriever device, it will cost a bit more, like I think the advanced chip, maybe.\n\n0:25:30\tSPEAKER_02\n And how do you know?\n\n0:25:32\tSPEAKER_02\n You got that email.\n\n0:25:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe you can look it up right now.\n\n0:25:36\tSPEAKER_03\n I didn't know about the retriever or...\n\n0:25:40\tSPEAKER_00\n When we leave the retriever in such a site, it would be a simple chip.\n\n0:25:46\tSPEAKER_00\n And with the retriever, it would be an advanced chip.\n\n0:25:50\tSPEAKER_02\n I'd point out the advanced chip for now, I guess.\n\n0:25:54\tSPEAKER_00\n That would be enough for a future recommendation.\n\n0:25:57\tSPEAKER_00\n There will be a lot of problems.\n\n0:25:59\tSPEAKER_00\n The simple sensor, simple speaker.\n\n0:26:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Is that the speaker?\n\n0:26:04\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know what it is.\n\n0:26:05\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:26:06\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know.\n\n0:26:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, we went for the double curved case, made out of plastic and rubber.\n\n0:26:19\tSPEAKER_00\n And with a special color.\n\n0:26:22\tSPEAKER_00\n I guess that's what we were.\n\n0:26:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, special color.\n\n0:26:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I don't know about the special color.\n\n0:26:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Otherwise, you can't stand the plastic color.\n\n0:26:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I think we have a special color.\n\n0:26:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Stand the rubber.\n\n0:26:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, then the push button.\n\n0:26:35\tSPEAKER_00\n I was just counting them.\n\n0:26:36\tSPEAKER_00\n I think you have to indicate the amount of push buttons we want to use.\n\n0:26:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, yes.\n\n0:26:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, that's a bit of a problem.\n\n0:26:44\tSPEAKER_00\n But I really don't understand that.\n\n0:26:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Because I can imagine a remote control with far more push buttons.\n\n0:26:50\tSPEAKER_00\n And it wouldn't be possible according to this sheet.\n\n0:26:54\tSPEAKER_01\n The simplest buttons.\n\n0:26:57\tSPEAKER_03\n No, it's only when you use push buttons, it will cost that much.\n\n0:27:02\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think so.\n\n0:27:03\tSPEAKER_02\n If you use a scroll wheel.\n\n0:27:04\tSPEAKER_02\n A mount.\n\n0:27:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, the yellow row is the amount.\n\n0:27:07\tSPEAKER_00\n You're in the number of components you plan to use in the five.\n\n0:27:09\tSPEAKER_00\n So the total cost.\n\n0:27:10\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:27:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe it's the kind of push buttons.\n\n0:27:13\tSPEAKER_03\n You can have four kinds of push buttons.\n\n0:27:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Rubber.\n\n0:27:16\tSPEAKER_01\n You can have one or is that nine?\n\n0:27:20\tSPEAKER_00\n And I count them like this.\n\n0:27:22\tSPEAKER_00\n One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.\n\n0:27:26\tSPEAKER_00\n You have 12 and 13 because this is one.\n\n0:27:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, 12.\n\n0:27:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, then it will be 18.\n\n0:27:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Because I rated them as a.\n\n0:27:37\tSPEAKER_00\n This is a report.\n\n0:27:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:27:40\tSPEAKER_00\n And I think that.\n\n0:27:41\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that.\n\n0:27:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Plus the mute button.\n\n0:27:43\tSPEAKER_00\n And it will be 18.\n\n0:27:45\tSPEAKER_02\n 18.\n\n0:27:46\tSPEAKER_02\n One, two, three, four, five.\n\n0:27:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Why is that so expensive?\n\n0:27:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I don't understand.\n\n0:27:52\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't get the point because it would be.\n\n0:27:55\tSPEAKER_00\n So relatively so expensive.\n\n0:27:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Just these small buttons.\n\n0:27:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Is it cents?\n\n0:28:01\tSPEAKER_01\n The 50 cents of butter.\n\n0:28:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Or one single stupid button.\n\n0:28:05\tSPEAKER_02\n So when you.\n\n0:28:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, let's make it just one.\n\n0:28:09\tSPEAKER_03\n It's 80% of the price of the.\n\n0:28:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, now it's now it's already.\n\n0:28:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n0:28:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Sure, we just.\n\n0:28:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Give our own interpretation to it because else we would really have a problem.\n\n0:28:21\tSPEAKER_00\n It would be impossible to make it.\n\n0:28:23\tSPEAKER_02\n I couldn't understand it if it was 50 cents per.\n\n0:28:26\tSPEAKER_02\n And per button.\n\n0:28:27\tSPEAKER_03\n When you have the same amount of button, you have to put it in a carton.\n\n0:28:31\tSPEAKER_00\n And that's what is then this.\n\n0:28:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Isn't possible.\n\n0:28:34\tSPEAKER_00\n This is the most simple.\n\n0:28:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it is possible.\n\n0:28:36\tSPEAKER_00\n But we've never seen one before.\n\n0:28:38\tSPEAKER_03\n I've seen one remote control.\n\n0:28:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, without the numbers.\n\n0:28:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, only with the.\n\n0:28:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Page up, page down.\n\n0:28:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but I wouldn't want to own that.\n\n0:28:48\tSPEAKER_02\n That's.\n\n0:28:49\tSPEAKER_02\n It's still for little children.\n\n0:28:51\tSPEAKER_03\n They can handle that remote control.\n\n0:28:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but it takes would also be impossible.\n\n0:28:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, it's for it's just for a little.\n\n0:28:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, we'll just.\n\n0:28:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, but then still when we.\n\n0:29:02\tSPEAKER_00\n There is no room for a darkening station or something.\n\n0:29:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's see, we have a button supplements.\n\n0:29:08\tSPEAKER_00\n We'll give the button a special color.\n\n0:29:10\tSPEAKER_00\n We'll give them a special form.\n\n0:29:11\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we should mark the special form thing because this will be some special form.\n\n0:29:16\tSPEAKER_00\n St. Corporated in these big buttons, I guess.\n\n0:29:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Because the buttons will be that will be matching color between the buttons and the rubber surroundings.\n\n0:29:26\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that's what they mean by a special color.\n\n0:29:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Why is it?\n\n0:29:30\tSPEAKER_00\n I think all the special color things have to be marked over here because that's what we were planning to do making it.\n\n0:29:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Special form also.\n\n0:29:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, special material also because there's rubber and the buttons have to be rubber.\n\n0:29:43\tSPEAKER_03\n What is the normal material?\n\n0:29:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I don't know.\n\n0:29:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Classic, I think.\n\n0:29:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Classic.\n\n0:29:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Classic.\n\n0:29:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, but the problem now is that there's no such thing as a darkening station in this list.\n\n0:29:58\tSPEAKER_00\n But we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a darkening station for 30 cents.\n\n0:30:05\tSPEAKER_03\n But we can sell the remote control and sell the darkening station separately.\n\n0:30:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, no.\n\n0:30:15\tSPEAKER_03\n We don't have to tell it, but what we can say can almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the darkening station.\n\n0:30:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Never mind, I do like that idea.\n\n0:30:28\tSPEAKER_00\n But then the darkening station isn't relevant for this project anymore when we come.\n\n0:30:32\tSPEAKER_03\n No, but then why should we still have to use it?\n\n0:30:35\tSPEAKER_00\n We have to find out what chip we need.\n\n0:30:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I really don't get it.\n\n0:30:40\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we can all go this way.\n\n0:30:43\tSPEAKER_00\n I think a special color thing has to be marked.\n\n0:30:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Because I think we...\n\n0:30:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I think that's what they...\n\n0:30:51\tSPEAKER_03\n But for two euros and 30 cents we don't get a darkening station.\n\n0:30:55\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:30:56\tSPEAKER_00\n But can we find out about the chips?\n\n0:30:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Because when we don't need a darkening station then probably we also need a simple chip.\n\n0:31:05\tSPEAKER_01\n And then we can get a nice...\n\n0:31:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Then we can do something extra.\n\n0:31:10\tSPEAKER_00\n But still it's going to get more expensive with a simple...\n\n0:31:13\tSPEAKER_00\n And we have some money left.\n\n0:31:15\tSPEAKER_00\n We can put...\n\n0:31:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Then for two euros...\n\n0:31:17\tSPEAKER_00\n We can put a scroll wheel on it.\n\n0:31:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we'll... who knows?\n\n0:31:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Ah, why?\n\n0:31:23\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, a bit of titanium.\n\n0:31:24\tSPEAKER_02\n If it would cost two euros, I had a total thing and it would be nice too.\n\n0:31:28\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, we're not going to add...\n\n0:31:30\tSPEAKER_02\n But what...\n\n0:31:31\tSPEAKER_00\n What can we do?\n\n0:31:32\tSPEAKER_00\n How are we going to do the kinetic cells?\n\n0:31:34\tSPEAKER_00\n That's also maybe an idea.\n\n0:31:35\tSPEAKER_01\n So what can we do with a simple chip?\n\n0:31:37\tSPEAKER_01\n What's different with the regular chip?\n\n0:31:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, that's what it is to find out.\n\n0:31:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe you can find it in your email right now.\n\n0:31:42\tSPEAKER_00\n And we know...\n\n0:31:43\tSPEAKER_00\n And we exactly know what it will cost us.\n\n0:31:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe it's that... that's nice to know.\n\n0:31:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Correct your chip.\n\n0:31:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Because we don't have special functions to use...\n\n0:31:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but when we...\n\n0:31:55\tSPEAKER_01\n A palm chip, for example, on the hand in normal.\n\n0:31:57\tSPEAKER_00\n But when we skip...\n\n0:31:58\tSPEAKER_00\n When we don't use the...\n\n0:32:02\tSPEAKER_00\n So we're not going to make the docking station.\n\n0:32:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Then we still...\n\n0:32:06\tSPEAKER_00\n And we need something else, maybe, to make it kind of special.\n\n0:32:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Because that was our special function.\n\n0:32:11\tSPEAKER_02\n You can make a plain docking station for two euros.\n\n0:32:14\tSPEAKER_00\n We'll go back...\n\n0:32:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, you can also do the...\n\n0:32:16\tSPEAKER_00\n But...\n\n0:32:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Without the recharge...\n\n0:32:18\tSPEAKER_00\n It still is a special remote control.\n\n0:32:20\tSPEAKER_00\n You know, it's for a special one.\n\n0:32:23\tSPEAKER_02\n But we can make a docking station for two euros.\n\n0:32:25\tSPEAKER_02\n If you don't put the recharge function in it.\n\n0:32:29\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, it has a shape.\n\n0:32:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but of course, we have two euros.\n\n0:32:34\tSPEAKER_00\n And we still...\n\n0:32:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe we have to use the advanced chip.\n\n0:32:37\tSPEAKER_00\n And two euros isn't even possible.\n\n0:32:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Why should that not be possible?\n\n0:32:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, because then we...\n\n0:32:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Three cents left.\n\n0:32:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Now, for the docking station, if you choose a simple chip.\n\n0:32:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but...\n\n0:32:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I don't know, because maybe...\n\n0:32:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we'll find out what it's saying.\n\n0:32:57\tSPEAKER_01\n If we're doing...\n\n0:32:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Do we need an advanced chip?\n\n0:33:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, and we are...\n\n0:33:02\tSPEAKER_00\n And what is this?\n\n0:33:03\tSPEAKER_00\n A sample sample.\n\n0:33:04\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know if it's a...\n\n0:33:06\tSPEAKER_03\n It isn't in my information.\n\n0:33:08\tSPEAKER_03\n I've got a...\n\n0:33:11\tSPEAKER_03\n A schematic view of the remote control.\n\n0:33:14\tSPEAKER_03\n But nothing about advanced chips or...\n\n0:33:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's...\n\n0:33:20\tSPEAKER_00\n You can look at it for presentation.\n\n0:33:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Technical functions?\n\n0:33:27\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:33:28\tSPEAKER_01\n I've got the error...\n\n0:33:29\tSPEAKER_03\n I will put a page on it.\n\n0:33:34\tSPEAKER_03\n When my mouse works again.\n\n0:33:50\tSPEAKER_03\n My mouse is...\n\n0:33:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Dead.\n\n0:33:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:33:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Reanimated.\n\n0:33:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Dead.\n\n0:33:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Ah, I forgot it.\n\n0:34:00\tSPEAKER_03\n I will put my email on the...\n\n0:34:04\tSPEAKER_03\n...network.\n\n0:34:14\tSPEAKER_02\n What the hell are these?\n\n0:34:16\tSPEAKER_03\n It's on it.\n\n0:34:18\tSPEAKER_02\n What a...\n\n0:34:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Here it's open.\n\n0:34:24\tNone\n I don't think here is in here already.\n\n0:34:54\tNone\n There's only just...\n\n0:35:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Something about...\n\n0:35:06\tSPEAKER_01\n There's nothing about...\n\n0:35:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:09\tSPEAKER_01\n At the end of the work...\n\n0:35:11\tSPEAKER_01\n There's an infrared LED.\n\n0:35:15\tSPEAKER_00\n And in the presentation of yours, there was also something about different components.\n\n0:35:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Which one was it?\n\n0:35:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Fictional requirements?\n\n0:35:24\tSPEAKER_02\n No, that was my first one.\n\n0:35:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Components designed maybe.\n\n0:35:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes, that was mine.\n\n0:35:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes, that was the second one.\n\n0:35:33\tSPEAKER_03\n But that was my second.\n\n0:35:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it was my second.\n\n0:35:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Your first presentation.\n\n0:35:38\tSPEAKER_02\n It's at the bottom.\n\n0:35:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Where it comes from?\n\n0:35:41\tSPEAKER_02\n It's at your taskbar.\n\n0:35:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but it's the other one.\n\n0:35:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh.\n\n0:35:47\tSPEAKER_01\n This is not a work in design or components.\n\n0:35:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Not the right one.\n\n0:35:52\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't...\n\n0:35:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, sorry.\n\n0:35:56\tSPEAKER_00\n No, this is the other one.\n\n0:35:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe something is...\n\n0:36:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe there's something about...\n\n0:36:02\tSPEAKER_00\n In these chipset?\n\n0:36:06\tSPEAKER_03\n This is the same...\n\n0:36:09\tSPEAKER_03\n This is only the possibilities.\n\n0:36:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:15\tSPEAKER_03\n We can use a simple regular or advanced chip.\n\n0:36:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, nice.\n\n0:36:22\tSPEAKER_00\n You know that a push button requires a simple chip, but a scroll wheel...\n\n0:36:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, okay.\n\n0:36:28\tSPEAKER_00\n The regular tool is the hybrid.\n\n0:36:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so we only need a simple chip.\n\n0:36:33\tSPEAKER_03\n With a light.\n\n0:36:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Little light.\n\n0:36:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but that's just the same as the...\n\n0:36:39\tSPEAKER_00\n No, this is a simple chip.\n\n0:36:42\tSPEAKER_00\n The scroll wheel...\n\n0:36:45\tSPEAKER_00\n It only states that the scroll wheel requires a regular chip, and that a display requires an advanced chip.\n\n0:36:51\tSPEAKER_02\n This play is, of course, a version of that.\n\n0:36:54\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think that...\n\n0:36:57\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:36:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Just a little light.\n\n0:37:00\tSPEAKER_01\n I think a normal, simple chip, will be okay.\n\n0:37:03\tSPEAKER_01\n I agree.\n\n0:37:04\tSPEAKER_00\n And what's the simple sensor slash simple speaker?\n\n0:37:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe you can say against remote page...\n\n0:37:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Page up page down.\n\n0:37:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I guess so too.\n\n0:37:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:19\tSPEAKER_01\n That's not what we want.\n\n0:37:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, we might want it, but...\n\n0:37:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:37:26\tSPEAKER_00\n All in 12 euros...\n\n0:37:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Back to the car.\n\n0:37:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:31\tSPEAKER_03\n 12 euros and 50 cents.\n\n0:37:33\tSPEAKER_03\n We're going to use a simple chip.\n\n0:37:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Great.\n\n0:37:36\tSPEAKER_02\n The lead.\n\n0:37:37\tSPEAKER_03\n And the lights.\n\n0:37:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, there's no...\n\n0:37:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, they're free, I guess.\n\n0:37:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Get a glory.\n\n0:37:44\tSPEAKER_00\n No, there is so many left to be spent.\n\n0:37:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Can we do it?\n\n0:37:51\tSPEAKER_02\n We think we can make a down here.\n\n0:37:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, but what we have to think about now is that...\n\n0:37:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Is this still a special remote control?\n\n0:37:59\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, it hasn't got any innovative technology.\n\n0:38:03\tSPEAKER_00\n We're not going to apply any innovative technology anyway, I think.\n\n0:38:09\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't see any possibility to do so because it wouldn't fit our...\n\n0:38:14\tSPEAKER_00\n The original philosophy.\n\n0:38:16\tSPEAKER_00\n But is there some extra...\n\n0:38:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something instead of the rechargeable...\n\n0:38:24\tSPEAKER_00\n The rechargeable thing was something to...\n\n0:38:27\tSPEAKER_00\n So people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore.\n\n0:38:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe if we put the kinetic thing in...\n\n0:38:34\tSPEAKER_00\n But sometimes you put it...\n\n0:38:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I know, but still they will think about that.\n\n0:38:40\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean...\n\n0:38:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Canetics are now the only use in watches.\n\n0:38:44\tSPEAKER_00\n It's made for us people.\n\n0:38:46\tSPEAKER_00\n If it was a useless technology, they wouldn't put it as a possibility.\n\n0:38:51\tSPEAKER_00\n A solar system, I use this.\n\n0:38:53\tSPEAKER_00\n The targets group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of thinking.\n\n0:39:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Because I think when there was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic power source, then it would be this one.\n\n0:39:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Because it gets thrown around a lot and gets used a lot.\n\n0:39:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe that's a cool thing about it.\n\n0:39:24\tSPEAKER_00\n You know, you don't use batteries.\n\n0:39:26\tSPEAKER_00\n I've never seen it before in a remote control.\n\n0:39:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Then we can make a docking station.\n\n0:39:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Five minutes.\n\n0:39:34\tSPEAKER_00\n No, we can't make a docking station anyway.\n\n0:39:37\tSPEAKER_02\n That's not true.\n\n0:39:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we can also...\n\n0:39:39\tSPEAKER_00\n We can make a docking station.\n\n0:39:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Why not?\n\n0:39:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Look at now.\n\n0:39:43\tSPEAKER_01\n We got two...\n\n0:39:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Two-thirty.\n\n0:39:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Two-thirty left.\n\n0:39:46\tSPEAKER_01\n We can't get an exact docking station.\n\n0:39:48\tSPEAKER_03\n We can make a docking station with a cable, with buttons on it.\n\n0:39:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Sure.\n\n0:39:52\tSPEAKER_03\n With retrieval, dividing it.\n\n0:39:54\tSPEAKER_02\n The power device is very cheap.\n\n0:39:56\tSPEAKER_02\n That's just a regular power cable.\n\n0:39:58\tSPEAKER_00\n It would be serious.\n\n0:39:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Then the docking station would be...\n\n0:40:01\tSPEAKER_00\n With a button, the price of the remote control.\n\n0:40:04\tSPEAKER_03\n With a button to retrieve it, so it will beep.\n\n0:40:08\tSPEAKER_03\n So it's wireless.\n\n0:40:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but we don't...\n\n0:40:11\tSPEAKER_00\n We haven't looked at the discourse of the speaker and other stuff.\n\n0:40:17\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't think it's realistically to do so.\n\n0:40:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, then it's useless project.\n\n0:40:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Look at the case.\n\n0:40:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, because we...\n\n0:40:24\tSPEAKER_03\n The case of a...\n\n0:40:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, then we don't have to...\n\n0:40:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Look at all these special stuff we have.\n\n0:40:30\tSPEAKER_00\n The colors are special.\n\n0:40:31\tSPEAKER_00\n The form is special.\n\n0:40:32\tSPEAKER_00\n It's this whole concept.\n\n0:40:34\tSPEAKER_00\n And maybe with the kinetic thing, I think we could do a compromise with the kinetic thing.\n\n0:40:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Can we say 15 euros?\n\n0:40:41\tSPEAKER_02\n No, it's the...\n\n0:40:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I mean...\n\n0:40:43\tSPEAKER_03\n No, then we have to sell it for 30 euros.\n\n0:40:46\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:40:47\tSPEAKER_02\n No, we already make less profit of it.\n\n0:40:51\tSPEAKER_02\n You can sell for 27.5.\n\n0:40:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Then you make as much profit as you would with 12.5 production costs.\n\n0:40:59\tSPEAKER_00\n My suggestion is just forget about the whole talking station thing and make it like...\n\n0:41:06\tSPEAKER_00\n I still...\n\n0:41:07\tSPEAKER_00\n I also feel this concept of making it kinetic.\n\n0:41:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Because of the...\n\n0:41:12\tSPEAKER_00\n You know, it gives something dynamic to the remote control.\n\n0:41:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe we can do both in the remote.\n\n0:41:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Battery and kinetic.\n\n0:41:20\tSPEAKER_03\n No.\n\n0:41:21\tSPEAKER_00\n No, that wouldn't...\n\n0:41:23\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:41:24\tSPEAKER_02\n 1320.\n\n0:41:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, and it is also not a good...\n\n0:41:29\tSPEAKER_00\n And I think that...\n\n0:41:30\tSPEAKER_00\n You really do it only kinetic.\n\n0:41:31\tSPEAKER_00\n You don't want to think about batteries anymore.\n\n0:41:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes, but only kinetic.\n\n0:41:34\tSPEAKER_00\n No, no.\n\n0:41:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Then you have to shake it.\n\n0:41:36\tSPEAKER_03\n And oh, when it's empty.\n\n0:41:38\tSPEAKER_03\n It's great.\n\n0:41:39\tSPEAKER_02\n It's great.\n\n0:41:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Throw it through the room like 20 times an hour.\n\n0:41:42\tSPEAKER_00\n No, no, no, no.\n\n0:41:43\tSPEAKER_00\n No, no, no.\n\n0:41:44\tSPEAKER_00\n It's very sophisticated, not only the technology.\n\n0:41:46\tSPEAKER_00\n When you...\n\n0:41:47\tSPEAKER_00\n You're remote like once a day or maybe even less.\n\n0:41:50\tSPEAKER_03\n No, that's not true.\n\n0:41:52\tSPEAKER_03\n A watch is kinetic.\n\n0:41:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Because you walk all the time.\n\n0:41:55\tSPEAKER_00\n We can make it.\n\n0:41:56\tSPEAKER_00\n No, we can...\n\n0:41:57\tSPEAKER_00\n But the remote control gets...\n\n0:41:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Why do they state that this technology can't be used to it?\n\n0:42:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, solar cells are also stated.\n\n0:42:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but a calculator also works on solar cells.\n\n0:42:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Why are you...\n\n0:42:08\tSPEAKER_03\n You solar cells, then.\n\n0:42:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Because I think the whole dynamic part...\n\n0:42:13\tSPEAKER_00\n It appeals to me thinking of our design philosophy, you know, with the rubber parts and...\n\n0:42:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Sturdiness of the thing and when you move it around a lot, then people find the idea funny.\n\n0:42:24\tSPEAKER_00\n And when I move my remote control around them.\n\n0:42:26\tSPEAKER_02\n That's true.\n\n0:42:27\tSPEAKER_02\n It's funny for a week.\n\n0:42:28\tSPEAKER_02\n I guess something like that, where you have to move it around very frequently.\n\n0:42:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Is the moment...\n\n0:42:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but you don't have to.\n\n0:42:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Trust me, the idea of this technology is that you don't think about it just happens.\n\n0:42:40\tSPEAKER_02\n No, I don't move my...\n\n0:42:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, we don't have to do it.\n\n0:42:44\tSPEAKER_00\n But what...\n\n0:42:45\tSPEAKER_00\n That we just have a lack of key futures.\n\n0:42:47\tSPEAKER_00\n You have to put something on your box to make people buy it.\n\n0:42:51\tSPEAKER_00\n We can't really do the docking thing.\n\n0:42:55\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not...\n\n0:42:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we can do it, but it would be easy way out.\n\n0:42:59\tSPEAKER_03\n You can do it for 50 cents.\n\n0:43:01\tSPEAKER_02\n We've got more than 50 cents.\n\n0:43:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, but we have to do...\n\n0:43:06\tSPEAKER_00\n The case alone is...\n\n0:43:07\tSPEAKER_00\n It's only a familiar left or something.\n\n0:43:09\tSPEAKER_03\n The case alone for a remote control is at least one euro.\n\n0:43:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Then we have one euro, 30, for the whole docking station.\n\n0:43:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, we can leave it on bad...\n\n0:43:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Then our concept is ready.\n\n0:43:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Keep remote control.\n\n0:43:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we make some extra profit on that.\n\n0:43:32\tSPEAKER_02\n No, we bond.\n\n0:43:34\tSPEAKER_02\n But that's...\n\n0:43:35\tSPEAKER_02\n No, it won't sell, but...\n\n0:43:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Any ideas?\n\n0:43:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Of course not.\n\n0:43:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Great, is he?\n\n0:43:45\tSPEAKER_03\n It's great.\n\n0:43:47\tSPEAKER_01\n We just have to go all what we did today again.\n\n0:43:51\tSPEAKER_01\n We have to do it over.\n\n0:43:53\tSPEAKER_02\n We'll come back tomorrow, okay?\n\n0:43:55\tSPEAKER_00\n No, there's still some concepts and some special left.\n\n0:43:59\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, it's going to excel in the field of design and looks and feel.\n\n0:44:07\tSPEAKER_00\n That's what makes it special.\n\n0:44:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, and I would like...\n\n0:44:15\tSPEAKER_00\n I would have liked the kinetic part as well to give it some...\n\n0:44:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Just to give it some extra special future.\n\n0:44:21\tSPEAKER_00\n I know it will work.\n\n0:44:23\tSPEAKER_00\n They're not putting technology on this list if it was impossible to...\n\n0:44:28\tSPEAKER_00\n To make it happen.\n\n0:44:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Why not a hand, I don't know, then.\n\n0:44:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, but we'll leave like this.\n\n0:44:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Then it's...\n\n0:44:38\tSPEAKER_02\n We can't do anything else.\n\n0:44:42\tSPEAKER_03\n We're done.\n\n0:44:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, is this it?\n\n0:44:49\tSPEAKER_00\n We're going to...\n\n0:44:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, we'll put the last sheet.\n\n0:44:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Now we can't.\n\n0:44:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we have to...\n\n0:45:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, yes, celebration.\n\n0:45:05\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't see why, but...\n\n0:45:08\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we've got to fill out another questioner to be honest.\n\n0:45:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah?\n\n0:45:12\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't hear a bell.\n\n0:45:14\tNone\n No, not yet.\n\n0:45:19\tSPEAKER_04\n All right, I'll see you guys in a minute.\n\n0:45:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Bye.\n\n0:45:23\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't think so.\n\n0:45:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Can we do it here?\n\n0:45:26\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know.\n\n0:45:27\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think so.\n\n0:45:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Just fill that one in.\n\n0:45:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Now we're doing now.\n\n0:45:54\tSPEAKER_01\n But it's all in your room.\n\n0:45:56\tNone\n So there are two more questions.\n\n0:45:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, okay.\n\n0:46:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Nice.\n\n0:46:32\tNone\n We're done.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "SPEAKER and his colleagues are going to present a
