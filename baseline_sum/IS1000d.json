soon.\n\n0:00:25\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:00:26\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:00:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe I should change the pen otherwise.\n\n0:00:40\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm gonna come quickly.\n\n0:00:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Don't know.\n\n0:00:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe the pen's supposed to go over the seats.\n\n0:00:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Might be a seat for rather than the person.\n\n0:00:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I'm using it.\n\n0:00:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:00:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it's making pace at me.\n\n0:01:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:01:04\tSPEAKER_05\n So, Matthew is late again.\n\n0:01:10\tSPEAKER_05\n Probably an important man.\n\n0:01:13\tSPEAKER_05\n So, well, it is important for him to be here.\n\n0:01:22\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:01:25\tSPEAKER_05\n So, what I mean is that you did work together.\n\n0:01:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:01:31\tSPEAKER_00\n So, I would be able to summarize our meeting.\n\n0:01:37\tSPEAKER_00\n But still, I think it would be very important if the as a main designer.\n\n0:01:46\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it would be important that he's here.\n\n0:01:49\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:01:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Basically, yeah, we designed two items.\n\n0:02:05\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes, but we...\n\n0:02:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Can we have a phone or someone?\n\n0:02:14\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes, we should phone him.\n\n0:02:17\tSPEAKER_05\n It's really a work design.\n\n0:02:20\tSPEAKER_05\n When he's not here, we just have to continue.\n\n0:02:25\tSPEAKER_05\n So, just for a record, I will take notes again.\n\n0:02:29\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:02:31\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, first thing, I got an email from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the 12 euro and 50 cents.\n\n0:02:50\tSPEAKER_05\n He said to me, well, when you stay in, it's good.\n\n0:02:56\tSPEAKER_05\n When you don't stay in, you have to redesign.\n\n0:02:59\tSPEAKER_05\n There is no negotiation possible in this matter.\n\n0:03:07\tSPEAKER_05\n So, we have to consider that.\n\n0:03:10\tSPEAKER_05\n Good.\n\n0:03:13\tSPEAKER_05\n So, maybe Anna, you can have your project.\n\n0:03:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, we had no evaluation until we have a design.\n\n0:03:23\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:03:26\tNone\n Thank you.\n\n0:03:30\tSPEAKER_05\n Thank you.\n\n0:03:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Thank you.\n\n0:03:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Great, great.\n\n0:03:38\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, maybe then you can start now with presenting your designs.\n\n0:03:44\tSPEAKER_00\n So, I will start by the basic one that fits into 8 euros, actually.\n\n0:03:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Right?\n\n0:03:58\tSPEAKER_00\n 7, 8 euros.\n\n0:04:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, first, for both, they have a special shape, maybe the designer can explain better than me.\n\n0:04:10\tSPEAKER_00\n But it's like a surf board.\n\n0:04:14\tSPEAKER_00\n And you are supposed to surf to browse, to surf TV, maybe the web.\n\n0:04:21\tSPEAKER_00\n And it's kind of interesting shape because unconsciously people want to surf.\n\n0:04:30\tSPEAKER_00\n And also, it's not too far from a mobile.\n\n0:04:39\tSPEAKER_00\n So, people are used to that kind of shape.\n\n0:04:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Don't take care too much about the color because...\n\n0:04:45\tSPEAKER_00\n No, yes, I'm supposed to give some more offers.\n\n0:04:48\tSPEAKER_00\n So, here would be basically the infrared...\n\n0:04:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, LED.\n\n0:05:01\tSPEAKER_00\n The on-off button in wet.\n\n0:05:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Here would be the volume on the left.\n\n0:05:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:05:09\tSPEAKER_00\n It's easy to turn on and off.\n\n0:05:12\tSPEAKER_00\n And so, this is a very cheap version, so there are...\n\n0:05:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe you can carry on with you.\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_02\n So, you have browsing the channels, actually, so you can go up and down the channels.\n\n0:05:26\tSPEAKER_02\n If you have a video or something, you can forward...\n\n0:05:32\tSPEAKER_00\n How can you change from VCR to...\n\n0:05:35\tSPEAKER_00\n...CV, by the way?\n\n0:05:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, no, no, no, no.\n\n0:05:39\tSPEAKER_02\n This is a model with just a TV one.\n\n0:05:42\tSPEAKER_02\n No, no, sorry.\n\n0:05:43\tSPEAKER_02\n This is a standard TV one.\n\n0:05:45\tSPEAKER_02\n We are not talking about that.\n\n0:05:46\tSPEAKER_02\n So, and then we have usually... there are 12 keys, but we know that we have only 10 digits.\n\n0:05:51\tSPEAKER_02\n The XR2 are for giving an option for having more than one channel.\n\n0:06:00\tSPEAKER_02\n And the other one is for the teletext or something you wonder about through from that.\n\n0:06:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, so it's a very basic...\n\n0:06:08\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a very basic minimal thing which you can...\n\n0:06:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Which is also available in the market, actually, that's what it is that today.\n\n0:06:17\tSPEAKER_02\n And it costs us to build these about 80 euros.\n\n0:06:20\tSPEAKER_05\n Except for the special shape, the surfboard, it has a quite...\n\n0:06:25\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:26\tSPEAKER_05\n...conventional layout of buttons.\n\n0:06:29\tSPEAKER_02\n So, this one model and...\n\n0:06:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Can I see?\n\n0:06:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, sure.\n\n0:06:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I like the volume control, that's good.\n\n0:06:42\tSPEAKER_02\n This is a magic one, but right now we don't want to talk about that.\n\n0:06:48\tSPEAKER_02\n It is a very futuristic, it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff.\n\n0:06:55\tSPEAKER_02\n We are thinking about the future, it can come.\n\n0:06:58\tSPEAKER_02\n So, it doesn't have any partners.\n\n0:07:00\tSPEAKER_02\n But then what we live in...\n\n0:07:05\tSPEAKER_05\n This is a model in the end.\n\n0:07:09\tNone\n I just...\n\n0:07:10\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't feel so.\n\n0:07:11\tSPEAKER_05\n I really feel like my mobile phone.\n\n0:07:14\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:15\tSPEAKER_05\n Just signing.\n\n0:07:16\tSPEAKER_05\n I really want to talk to it.\n\n0:07:19\tSPEAKER_05\n It won't talk that.\n\n0:07:21\tSPEAKER_05\n So, but continue with your work.\n\n0:07:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, then this is a...\n\n0:07:30\tSPEAKER_02\n A little smooth and it gives a lot of functionality in this way.\n\n0:07:36\tSPEAKER_02\n So, all we have...\n\n0:07:37\tSPEAKER_02\n You see that there are only six keys, but don't worry, they are doing the job of 12 keys actually here.\n\n0:07:44\tSPEAKER_02\n And so, they have more space actually and it's easy to use this.\n\n0:07:51\tSPEAKER_02\n And you have...\n\n0:07:54\tSPEAKER_02\n So, this is a standard, you have infrared eye and then you have a power button.\n\n0:08:01\tSPEAKER_02\n You should volume what you have.\n\n0:08:03\tSPEAKER_02\n And then other than that, you have a channel up and down and the low-pous or...\n\n0:08:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Slow-downs.\n\n0:08:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:13\tSPEAKER_02\n And then you have a LCD display here and this is the functional thing which can change like...\n\n0:08:26\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a toggle switch which could change the function.\n\n0:08:30\tSPEAKER_02\n So, DVD player to telephoto.\n\n0:08:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:34\tSPEAKER_02\n You can change it to...\n\n0:08:35\tSPEAKER_05\n Instead of having many switches and then you get feedback, fire the LCD.\n\n0:08:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, LCD can display what is that on that.\n\n0:08:44\tSPEAKER_02\n And well, you can have an integrated microphone over here.\n\n0:08:48\tSPEAKER_02\n This is the oven.\n\n0:08:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Or an oven button here.\n\n0:08:52\tSPEAKER_02\n So, which can basically you want to do a speech recognition and the channel or whatever information can be displayed here directly on the...\n\n0:09:03\tSPEAKER_02\n On your display.\n\n0:09:05\tSPEAKER_02\n And here is a small LED which is like blinking one.\n\n0:09:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Which tells you like are you running out of the battery and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier.\n\n0:09:17\tSPEAKER_02\n And then we have a cover basically.\n\n0:09:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Basically you don't need much of the time this.\n\n0:09:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:25\tSPEAKER_02\n When you need you can use it.\n\n0:09:27\tSPEAKER_02\n And this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want.\n\n0:09:30\tSPEAKER_02\n You can add a tactile thing to this cover.\n\n0:09:35\tSPEAKER_05\n And then you can add a little bit of a design.\n\n0:09:40\tSPEAKER_05\n But when this is closed.\n\n0:09:42\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:43\tSPEAKER_05\n We'll also cover up the LCD.\n\n0:09:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:46\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:47\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:48\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:49\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:50\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:51\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:52\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:53\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:54\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:05\tSPEAKER_02\n You want to.\n\n0:10:06\tSPEAKER_02\n And this gives a protection to the LCD actually giving a cover to that.\n\n0:10:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Actually.\n\n0:10:12\tSPEAKER_02\n It gives a protection because when it falls down or something.\n\n0:10:16\tSPEAKER_02\n It is.\n\n0:10:17\tSPEAKER_02\n It is.\n\n0:10:18\tSPEAKER_02\n It's more robust.\n\n0:10:19\tSPEAKER_02\n It's more robust that way.\n\n0:10:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:22\tSPEAKER_02\n And you have very good chances.\n\n0:10:23\tSPEAKER_00\n It's low weight.\n\n0:10:24\tSPEAKER_00\n You have to see.\n\n0:10:25\tSPEAKER_00\n The components we put inside is very low weight.\n\n0:10:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:30\tSPEAKER_00\n So the cost is actually a bit more.\n\n0:10:33\tSPEAKER_00\n It is 16 pounds.\n\n0:10:35\tSPEAKER_00\n 16 euros.\n\n0:10:36\tSPEAKER_02\n 16 euros.\n\n0:10:37\tSPEAKER_00\n 16 euros.\n\n0:10:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:10:39\tSPEAKER_01\n So that's what I was talking about, isn't it?\n\n0:10:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Then it's out of budget.\n\n0:10:43\tSPEAKER_00\n The main point we talk about that with our manufacturer.\n\n0:10:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:48\tSPEAKER_00\n And they say it basically that the ASR system would be something like three francs per item.\n\n0:10:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Three euros.\n\n0:10:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Three euros.\n\n0:10:57\tSPEAKER_00\n And.\n\n0:10:58\tSPEAKER_01\n That's on top of the 16 or is it part of that?\n\n0:11:00\tSPEAKER_01\n No, no, part of that.\n\n0:11:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Part of them.\n\n0:11:02\tSPEAKER_01\n So that's exactly the end of 13 euros without the state of ignition.\n\n0:11:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:11:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, if you have new more ideas, we can add new more, some more keys if you want to, you know.\n\n0:11:17\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that, yeah, we should stick with a number of keys because if we add too much then.\n\n0:11:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it's not a bit clattering up everything.\n\n0:11:27\tSPEAKER_02\n What is this one on the side?\n\n0:11:29\tSPEAKER_02\n That's what it's kind of a LED for indicating your battery.\n\n0:11:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:11:34\tSPEAKER_02\n And as well as it's like a blinking one and keep it the same.\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Like the shape of them.\n\n0:11:38\tSPEAKER_01\n I do like them.\n\n0:11:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:40\tSPEAKER_01\n The size and the shape.\n\n0:11:42\tSPEAKER_05\n Before talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible, maybe.\n\n0:11:48\tSPEAKER_05\n And you can give us your.\n\n0:11:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:11:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products, both of these two.\n\n0:11:56\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes, the evaluation and also the evaluation criteria.\n\n0:12:00\tSPEAKER_05\n So what is important to look at?\n\n0:12:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Best guess what we've talked about already.\n\n0:12:06\tSPEAKER_01\n From the marketing point of view, we just want to make sure that we've taken into account.\n\n0:12:10\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, just do it quickly if we all already.\n\n0:12:14\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's just a short list of criteria on the things that we identified as being important to selling the product.\n\n0:12:23\tSPEAKER_01\n We just go through these and rate them as a group.\n\n0:12:26\tSPEAKER_01\n And at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that.\n\n0:12:29\tSPEAKER_01\n So just average the score of those items.\n\n0:12:32\tSPEAKER_01\n So these are things we identified as being important.\n\n0:12:38\tSPEAKER_01\n They show the three things we're looking to feel innovation and ease of use.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_01\n The three important components.\n\n0:12:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Appealing to the correct demographic.\n\n0:12:47\tSPEAKER_01\n So using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic.\n\n0:12:51\tSPEAKER_01\n And then following the company motto, following the fashion trends and putting the end to the product as well.\n\n0:12:58\tSPEAKER_01\n So we'll do you want to go through and put through those on the two products now.\n\n0:13:03\tSPEAKER_01\n I do want to discuss them further and then evaluate them.\n\n0:13:07\tSPEAKER_05\n No, why not discuss it now?\n\n0:13:10\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:13:11\tSPEAKER_01\n So I've just got to throw in whiteboard, I guess.\n\n0:13:15\tSPEAKER_01\n So the first one was really very far below budget.\n\n0:13:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have a high profit on it?\n\n0:13:41\tSPEAKER_01\n It was running a megabyte of the eight euros and we have a...\n\n0:13:46\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, my personal view is when this one is eight euros, we must think how can we improve it.\n\n0:13:56\tSPEAKER_05\n And then I mean, you must just see it as we can still spend this for half a euro.\n\n0:14:04\tSPEAKER_05\n And because the selling price is already quite fixed on 25 euros.\n\n0:14:15\tSPEAKER_05\n So we just have to offer as much as value for the customer he can have for 25 euro.\n\n0:14:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, it's looking pale in a fashion.\n\n0:14:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Come on.\n\n0:14:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Generative, easy to use.\n\n0:14:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Easy to use.\n\n0:14:52\tSPEAKER_00\n And trends.\n\n0:15:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Are we following the idea of using the removal covers on this?\n\n0:15:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Is that part of both them?\n\n0:15:14\tSPEAKER_05\n We can still discuss that.\n\n0:15:18\tSPEAKER_05\n And together with evaluating this, we might come with new ideas in adding things or removing options because they are expensive.\n\n0:15:30\tSPEAKER_05\n But I've received a framework which we can do this.\n\n0:15:39\tSPEAKER_05\n I mean, did you have this Excel sheet?\n\n0:15:43\tSPEAKER_05\n No.\n\n0:15:44\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, this is the latest price of our production unit for several components.\n\n0:15:53\tSPEAKER_05\n So we can see whether the price is within the twelve euros or fifty cents.\n\n0:16:01\tSPEAKER_05\n So maybe we can start with this calling this one.\n\n0:16:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, so that's the thing.\n\n0:16:06\tSPEAKER_05\n This is the first design.\n\n0:16:09\tSPEAKER_01\n I think that one's green.\n\n0:16:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:16:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, so look and feel where one is a brick and a pentagon.\n\n0:16:24\tSPEAKER_01\n There is another pentagon.\n\n0:16:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, get that one.\n\n0:16:29\tSPEAKER_01\n One's bad and seven's the best.\n\n0:16:32\tSPEAKER_01\n So one's true and seven's false.\n\n0:16:34\tSPEAKER_01\n One's the best.\n\n0:16:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:16:36\tSPEAKER_01\n So I'll scale one to seven.\n\n0:16:37\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, so look and feel.\n\n0:16:42\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, you already feel it pretty much, I think.\n\n0:16:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Sounds good.\n\n0:16:54\tSPEAKER_05\n In my opinion, if you really feel, it's very good.\n\n0:16:59\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:00\tSPEAKER_05\n It's very good in your hand.\n\n0:17:01\tSPEAKER_05\n So I would consider two or maybe even one for feel.\n\n0:17:06\tSPEAKER_05\n That's just half.\n\n0:17:07\tSPEAKER_05\n We should also consider look.\n\n0:17:09\tSPEAKER_05\n And then it looks quite conventional.\n\n0:17:16\tSPEAKER_05\n Don't you agree?\n\n0:17:18\tSPEAKER_01\n On the scale, between functional and fancy.\n\n0:17:23\tSPEAKER_01\n They're looking at it.\n\n0:17:24\tSPEAKER_05\n It's a safe five.\n\n0:17:27\tSPEAKER_02\n It's my opinion, but I don't know what to give it to me.\n\n0:17:31\tSPEAKER_02\n We have a very, very designed, it's like the surf.\n\n0:17:36\tSPEAKER_02\n As we say, you know, it does look is fine, but still I would give four in that case.\n\n0:17:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Four.\n\n0:17:44\tSPEAKER_05\n Four, yeah.\n\n0:17:45\tSPEAKER_05\n What other than that?\n\n0:17:46\tSPEAKER_02\n We should love four.\n\n0:17:47\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:48\tSPEAKER_02\n I would give, yeah.\n\n0:17:51\tNone\n That's not.\n\n0:17:53\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:17:54\tSPEAKER_05\n Can you maybe fix the other?\n\n0:17:56\tSPEAKER_00\n No, you should pray like this, not like this, or new.\n\n0:18:02\tSPEAKER_02\n No, it can't get the batteries.\n\n0:18:04\tSPEAKER_02\n No, no, the battery has fallen down.\n\n0:18:06\tSPEAKER_01\n The battery is not the ink.\n\n0:18:08\tSPEAKER_01\n That's the, that one.\n\n0:18:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:11\tSPEAKER_01\n So that's it.\n\n0:18:15\tSPEAKER_02\n But no, no, it's not that it's yet to close the battery.\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:18:22\tSPEAKER_02\n No, it should be.\n\n0:18:28\tSPEAKER_01\n No, I think it's lost a battery.\n\n0:18:30\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm trying to try it.\n\n0:18:31\tSPEAKER_01\n No, it's still right, but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors.\n\n0:18:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Is that another battery there?\n\n0:18:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:18:40\tSPEAKER_02\n You got it, sir.\n\n0:18:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Try it.\n\n0:18:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, we got better tell.\n\n0:18:47\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes, it is.\n\n0:18:48\tSPEAKER_05\n Perfect.\n\n0:18:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Perfect.\n\n0:18:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Is that working?\n\n0:19:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Did it come out?\n\n0:19:02\tSPEAKER_05\n Good.\n\n0:19:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Good.\n\n0:19:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Because we'd be able to see it still even if it wasn't working.\n\n0:19:06\tSPEAKER_01\n It's just no whiteboard marker.\n\n0:19:07\tSPEAKER_01\n But it wouldn't be picked up in the actual whiteboard.\n\n0:19:10\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:11\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:19:12\tSPEAKER_05\n So, then, then.\n\n0:19:14\tSPEAKER_01\n The other one?\n\n0:19:17\tNone\n Wow.\n\n0:19:18\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's slightly better.\n\n0:19:23\tSPEAKER_01\n The side shelf must have seen.\n\n0:19:26\tSPEAKER_05\n But when we want to include, I'm doubting about this component.\n\n0:19:33\tSPEAKER_05\n It breaks in your game.\n\n0:19:35\tSPEAKER_02\n No, actually, this is not going to approach you actually.\n\n0:19:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:19:39\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not a button, it's a lead.\n\n0:19:41\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a lead actually, which will be coming in a code.\n\n0:19:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Actually, yeah, it should be embedded.\n\n0:19:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, embedded that.\n\n0:19:47\tSPEAKER_00\n It won't be really, you know, you can push it again.\n\n0:19:50\tSPEAKER_00\n You can push it again.\n\n0:19:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:52\tSPEAKER_01\n The other thing is it's left hand one protruding because if people are left handed, then one needs other hand.\n\n0:19:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:58\tSPEAKER_02\n It works so well.\n\n0:19:59\tSPEAKER_02\n No, it's not protruding actually.\n\n0:20:01\tSPEAKER_02\n You just go embedded into that.\n\n0:20:04\tSPEAKER_01\n I'd say two or three for that one, personally.\n\n0:20:09\tSPEAKER_01\n What was three than two?\n\n0:20:12\tSPEAKER_05\n I think the look is better, but the feel is worse.\n\n0:20:15\tSPEAKER_05\n So I would also say this is four.\n\n0:20:18\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:20:19\tSPEAKER_05\n But do you think?\n\n0:20:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, it's fine, I think.\n\n0:20:22\tSPEAKER_02\n No, just that the feel is that you, right now you don't see that feel because I don't find them, but if you place it quite inside, now like this, now it's embedded one.\n\n0:20:37\tSPEAKER_02\n This is how the embedded one is.\n\n0:20:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it's basically the same thing actually.\n\n0:20:43\tSPEAKER_02\n You'll be, except that in this.\n\n0:20:46\tSPEAKER_02\n And the very CD makes it better.\n\n0:20:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:49\tSPEAKER_02\n And you may have a slight thing for it to follow.\n\n0:20:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it's definitely more fancy than that one.\n\n0:20:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:20:55\tSPEAKER_00\n I would say two or three.\n\n0:20:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:20:57\tSPEAKER_01\n So it consensus two or three?\n\n0:20:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Two or three.\n\n0:21:00\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, two or three.\n\n0:21:01\tSPEAKER_05\n Two or three.\n\n0:21:02\tNone\n Two or three.\n\n0:21:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, two or three.\n\n0:21:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:21:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:21:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Innovation.\n\n0:21:07\tSPEAKER_01\n The first one.\n\n0:21:08\tSPEAKER_00\n No, I think there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market.\n\n0:21:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:13\tSPEAKER_02\n But except for the design of the stuff.\n\n0:21:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:16\tSPEAKER_01\n The stuff.\n\n0:21:17\tSPEAKER_01\n What species are actually including, including like a location kind of thing?\n\n0:21:22\tSPEAKER_01\n I try to find it.\n\n0:21:23\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:21:24\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's one of the feel.\n\n0:21:26\tSPEAKER_01\n But there's no actual innovation in that at all.\n\n0:21:28\tSPEAKER_01\n It's just a straight-out remote control.\n\n0:21:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:30\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:31\tSPEAKER_05\n The only innovation is to shape.\n\n0:21:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:34\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:35\tSPEAKER_01\n So there's no, that's a looking field thing that was not a technical innovation.\n\n0:21:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:39\tSPEAKER_01\n So I'd be up to seven for innovation.\n\n0:21:42\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:43\tSPEAKER_00\n And the second one is really a state of the art.\n\n0:21:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:53\tSPEAKER_00\n In terms of innovation.\n\n0:21:56\tSPEAKER_00\n And with many more functionalities, you can open and impose the.\n\n0:22:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it is.\n\n0:22:05\tSPEAKER_05\n But a lot of LCD screens.\n\n0:22:09\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:10\tSPEAKER_00\n That's, that's, well, quite an all of the squaring, uh, buttons and menu and a programmable device behind this.\n\n0:22:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Uh, it could be that one or two.\n\n0:22:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:22:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Persona.\n\n0:22:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:26\tSPEAKER_01\n So what does the innovation, this got the LCD screen?\n\n0:22:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Automatically switch recognition.\n\n0:22:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Is that in this one now?\n\n0:22:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Is this because this is the no, no, two different options we discussed then.\n\n0:22:37\tSPEAKER_01\n We discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget.\n\n0:22:41\tSPEAKER_05\n We just discussed this as you would design it and then we'll try to.\n\n0:22:45\tSPEAKER_01\n So the cost for the is what was the cost for the first one?\n\n0:22:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Eight.\n\n0:22:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Eight.\n\n0:22:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Actually, we have, yeah, to check again.\n\n0:22:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:55\tSPEAKER_01\n And this one was 16 years.\n\n0:22:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:23:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:23:03\tSPEAKER_01\n So innovation for this one is two.\n\n0:23:09\tSPEAKER_01\n One.\n\n0:23:10\tSPEAKER_02\n That's all they would say to.\n\n0:23:12\tSPEAKER_00\n One to be one.\n\n0:23:13\tSPEAKER_00\n What would we do in it?\n\n0:23:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Actually, I don't see.\n\n0:23:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Why?\n\n0:23:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:23:18\tSPEAKER_00\n One would be without a button.\n\n0:23:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Am I?\n\n0:23:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, this speech recognition is a very good innovation.\n\n0:23:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:26\tSPEAKER_05\n So maybe with the speech recognition, it's using speech recognition.\n\n0:23:30\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, given that the works, yeah.\n\n0:23:34\tSPEAKER_05\n Then it's I think one.\n\n0:23:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:23:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Is it used?\n\n0:23:38\tSPEAKER_00\n So the first one is restandard so everybody can use it.\n\n0:23:45\tSPEAKER_00\n It's used to it.\n\n0:23:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, used to it.\n\n0:23:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:49\tSPEAKER_01\n So that's maybe a two phrase of use.\n\n0:23:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:52\tSPEAKER_00\n So the one is quite easy.\n\n0:23:57\tSPEAKER_00\n So though.\n\n0:23:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Though it has more functionality, I think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually.\n\n0:24:04\tSPEAKER_01\n So maybe a three or four.\n\n0:24:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Actually, in fact, I think it will be.\n\n0:24:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe sometimes people get scared with the number of buttons.\n\n0:24:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:19\tSPEAKER_00\n And there's like I would say three or four.\n\n0:24:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, we have reduced the key actually.\n\n0:24:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Three or four.\n\n0:24:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Three.\n\n0:24:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Three is fine.\n\n0:24:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Because it's not like a big one with a 100 buttons.\n\n0:24:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Actually, the user has to put some effort to do use that actually.\n\n0:24:37\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not so easy like this one than normal.\n\n0:24:40\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:41\tSPEAKER_05\n But then when when he used to it, it's quite easy.\n\n0:24:44\tSPEAKER_05\n It's quite easy.\n\n0:24:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Initially there is a lot of effort.\n\n0:24:48\tSPEAKER_05\n Good.\n\n0:24:49\tSPEAKER_01\n What's the next?\n\n0:24:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Three.\n\n0:24:51\tSPEAKER_01\n How well it goes to the target demographic.\n\n0:24:53\tSPEAKER_01\n So it was still thinking 20 to 40 year olds.\n\n0:24:55\tSPEAKER_00\n 20 to 40.\n\n0:24:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:24:57\tSPEAKER_00\n This one would be for one mother.\n\n0:24:59\tSPEAKER_02\n No, this one I would give this model to the whole people.\n\n0:25:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, one mother.\n\n0:25:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:05\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's completely changed our demographic there.\n\n0:25:07\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not part of the funky young thing.\n\n0:25:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, except for the surfing shape.\n\n0:25:11\tSPEAKER_05\n I mean, that's something with as an appeal on this group.\n\n0:25:14\tSPEAKER_01\n I think.\n\n0:25:15\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a very bottom price range.\n\n0:25:18\tSPEAKER_01\n It was like between this and another one, which did the same thing.\n\n0:25:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Then I can imagine it being a piling for the demographic, yeah.\n\n0:25:23\tSPEAKER_01\n But it's still.\n\n0:25:25\tSPEAKER_05\n We offer this.\n\n0:25:26\tSPEAKER_05\n We can consider, for instance, making this more attractive to the demographic.\n\n0:25:30\tSPEAKER_01\n So I've got room, but some budget there to add a few things to it.\n\n0:25:34\tSPEAKER_05\n But as it is now, I say, six.\n\n0:25:39\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:40\tNone\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:25:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you agree?\n\n0:25:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, because it's so important.\n\n0:25:47\tSPEAKER_00\n It was written that it was so important, the look and taking care of it.\n\n0:25:55\tSPEAKER_00\n It targets the right range of people.\n\n0:25:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but very easily in the market, it's going to be cheap, actually.\n\n0:26:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:06\tSPEAKER_01\n But it's going to be cheap, whatever though.\n\n0:26:07\tSPEAKER_01\n It was set with it.\n\n0:26:08\tSPEAKER_02\n It can still decide to use it to be providing.\n\n0:26:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Instead of it.\n\n0:26:14\tSPEAKER_00\n But for us, we have a constraint that we need to set at 25 euros.\n\n0:26:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:19\tSPEAKER_01\n There's nothing that would make me spend an extra few euros and that one rather than other one.\n\n0:26:22\tSPEAKER_05\n There's 25 euros.\n\n0:26:23\tSPEAKER_05\n I mean, it's not going to be cheaper.\n\n0:26:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, so in that case, well, it's fine.\n\n0:26:29\tSPEAKER_01\n And the demographic of the second one?\n\n0:26:32\tSPEAKER_02\n The demographic.\n\n0:26:33\tSPEAKER_02\n It's got the toys in it.\n\n0:26:34\tSPEAKER_01\n It's got the LCD screen.\n\n0:26:36\tSPEAKER_05\n And that I think it's better because of the LCD screen, which really don't feel on the YEP sign on the...\n\n0:26:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:45\tSPEAKER_00\n If you want to target, if we wish to sell four millions of this, I think for these agents, we need absolutely the LCD screen.\n\n0:26:55\tSPEAKER_05\n So the LCD screen attracts...\n\n0:26:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:00\tSPEAKER_01\n I think especially if we can have an LCD screen and a low range product, and that's good.\n\n0:27:04\tSPEAKER_05\n Maybe just something to consider.\n\n0:27:07\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:27:08\tSPEAKER_05\n So what...\n\n0:27:10\tSPEAKER_01\n I probably got this three again for that one.\n\n0:27:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I think it's...\n\n0:27:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, you're right.\n\n0:27:15\tSPEAKER_02\n It has more market actually.\n\n0:27:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Even one and two.\n\n0:27:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, you're right.\n\n0:27:19\tSPEAKER_01\n So two.\n\n0:27:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Two and two.\n\n0:27:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Because tomorrow, this will be more appealing because you can add a lot of investigation on that.\n\n0:27:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Because then you have it...\n\n0:27:31\tSPEAKER_02\n You have a lot of things which you can include for the people.\n\n0:27:33\tSPEAKER_01\n And especially I guess this is the speech recognition as well.\n\n0:27:36\tSPEAKER_01\n And that makes it more appealing, more of a new fun toy.\n\n0:27:41\tSPEAKER_02\n We have to practically test it.\n\n0:27:43\tSPEAKER_02\n The field test will tell you how good.\n\n0:27:46\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, you find a point.\n\n0:27:48\tSPEAKER_01\n And the trends.\n\n0:27:49\tSPEAKER_01\n So the trends were the Britain vegetables and the spongy feel.\n\n0:27:54\tSPEAKER_01\n So as it is, not really doing either of them.\n\n0:27:58\tSPEAKER_00\n I think spongy... that means it goes in the water.\n\n0:28:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, spongy could be part of the field of the buttons as well.\n\n0:28:08\tSPEAKER_01\n And I have some...\n\n0:28:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Have you tried them by well-fung?\n\n0:28:10\tSPEAKER_01\n They've got the kind of spongy buttons.\n\n0:28:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Not exactly spongy, but...\n\n0:28:13\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm thinking one of the not key is it's got like...\n\n0:28:15\tSPEAKER_01\n You can't...\n\n0:28:16\tSPEAKER_01\n You've got individual buttons.\n\n0:28:17\tSPEAKER_01\n It's got just one bit on it.\n\n0:28:19\tSPEAKER_01\n And so you can...\n\n0:28:20\tSPEAKER_01\n That feels kind of spongy.\n\n0:28:21\tSPEAKER_00\n This one includes this feature, right?\n\n0:28:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Spongy buttons.\n\n0:28:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, sort of...\n\n0:28:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, so they're going to be...\n\n0:28:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:28:28\tSPEAKER_00\n And maybe in the coro we can make it...\n\n0:28:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Fruit and veggie.\n\n0:28:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, that's if you use in the covers.\n\n0:28:37\tSPEAKER_05\n Or is it...\n\n0:28:38\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:28:39\tSPEAKER_05\n We can consider...\n\n0:28:41\tSPEAKER_05\n Is it possible, do you think, to make a cover for such a phone?\n\n0:28:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, they're back up in my walls.\n\n0:28:48\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know if I do want to cover that, actually.\n\n0:28:51\tSPEAKER_05\n Just with a flexible plastic...\n\n0:28:55\tSPEAKER_01\n So you've got the option of having different colors or different textures.\n\n0:28:57\tSPEAKER_01\n This is possible.\n\n0:28:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Is it...\n\n0:28:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Are you sure?\n\n0:29:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I think it should be possible, like, what we do with them all the time.\n\n0:29:07\tSPEAKER_05\n Or just two things which can be put on each other.\n\n0:29:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I do like Nokia.\n\n0:29:13\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:14\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:15\tSPEAKER_05\n I do like it.\n\n0:29:16\tSPEAKER_05\n Hi.\n\n0:29:17\tSPEAKER_05\n So...\n\n0:29:18\tSPEAKER_05\n Maybe we can...\n\n0:29:20\tSPEAKER_05\n But we have to decide that we can put the...\n\n0:29:24\tSPEAKER_05\n Offensive look of vegetables, for instance, to these coffers.\n\n0:29:30\tSPEAKER_05\n And now try to invest in the features.\n\n0:29:33\tSPEAKER_01\n I think that if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in electronics, it lets you find the latest fashion.\n\n0:29:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Even next year when Frinnbisch was not beat up, you'll still be able to put a new cover on it.\n\n0:29:45\tSPEAKER_00\n And then it'll still be in fashion.\n\n0:29:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Because sometimes look at this computer.\n\n0:29:49\tSPEAKER_00\n It's all black.\n\n0:29:50\tSPEAKER_00\n And it's quite conventional.\n\n0:29:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Sometimes people don't like too much flashy colors.\n\n0:29:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Like there's some presented here.\n\n0:29:58\tSPEAKER_00\n So maybe we could do...\n\n0:30:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Like in the range, the set of what we propose a black one.\n\n0:30:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:05\tSPEAKER_00\n The wrist-tun-dot one.\n\n0:30:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:07\tSPEAKER_00\n That meets the requirements of such people that want to really stand out in things.\n\n0:30:12\tSPEAKER_01\n And then you have the option of having different colors.\n\n0:30:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:16\tSPEAKER_05\n So that would make the trends equal. So we really have done that.\n\n0:30:22\tSPEAKER_01\n There's a picture that could be included in either of them.\n\n0:30:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Although it is more with the Spandy buttons on the...\n\n0:30:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, no.\n\n0:30:29\tSPEAKER_00\n...and it's a point better for the...\n\n0:30:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, sorry.\n\n0:30:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Two and three or one or two?\n\n0:30:35\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:30:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:30:37\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:30:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Say one, two.\n\n0:30:39\tSPEAKER_05\n One, two.\n\n0:30:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:30:41\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, by that.\n\n0:30:43\tSPEAKER_05\n So this one has Sponsy buttons.\n\n0:30:46\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, it says this.\n\n0:30:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it says this.\n\n0:30:49\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, so the average of that is...\n\n0:30:52\tSPEAKER_01\n...three, six, nine, about five.\n\n0:30:56\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:30:58\tSPEAKER_05\n Do you have a size of one?\n\n0:31:00\tSPEAKER_01\n One by six, one by six.\n\n0:31:02\tSPEAKER_01\n No, by five, one points, eight.\n\n0:31:04\tSPEAKER_02\n One by eight, yeah.\n\n0:31:07\tSPEAKER_01\n This one, 11, 13, 19, 21.\n\n0:31:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Five is 4.2.\n\n0:31:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, 1.2.\n\n0:31:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Very good.\n\n0:31:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:31:18\tSPEAKER_01\n But it's two of the very different price of those two.\n\n0:31:20\tSPEAKER_01\n So they're not really comparable, yeah, anyway.\n\n0:31:22\tSPEAKER_05\n We must try to get them close to...\n\n0:31:24\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:25\tSPEAKER_05\n...both in eight.\n\n0:31:27\tSPEAKER_05\n Or we just have to choose and adapt.\n\n0:31:30\tSPEAKER_05\n Because when we choose for this one, we have to...\n\n0:31:33\tSPEAKER_05\n We have to make it more attractive.\n\n0:31:35\tSPEAKER_05\n And when we choose for this one, we have to make it more cheap.\n\n0:31:39\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's easy to make that one cheap, but by just taking this bit of recognition out, that will basically take us down to the budget.\n\n0:31:45\tSPEAKER_05\n But now, did you work with the same price as I have here?\n\n0:31:51\tSPEAKER_00\n So I give, yeah, I just give it cool with the money picture and I expand them.\n\n0:31:57\tSPEAKER_00\n And they told me this could be possible for us to see in euros.\n\n0:32:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Unfortunately, we didn't see this shit.\n\n0:32:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Matthew, so maybe we have to recap with this one.\n\n0:32:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe we have to reconsider everything with this, yeah.\n\n0:32:13\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, yes, well, reconsider it.\n\n0:32:15\tSPEAKER_05\n So let's try to model this one in this heat.\n\n0:32:20\tSPEAKER_05\n What kind of energy source we didn't speak about yet.\n\n0:32:25\tSPEAKER_05\n It's a normal battery or...\n\n0:32:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it'll need more than a commercial one.\n\n0:32:33\tSPEAKER_02\n It won't be a...\n\n0:32:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe you might use an AA battery actually.\n\n0:32:39\tSPEAKER_02\n What do you say, Maya?\n\n0:32:41\tSPEAKER_00\n For this one, it's a normal battery.\n\n0:32:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes, it's a 1 battery.\n\n0:32:45\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:32:46\tSPEAKER_05\n Electronics.\n\n0:32:48\tSPEAKER_05\n I'll give it a speech recognition.\n\n0:32:50\tSPEAKER_05\n I think you should go for your fans cheap.\n\n0:32:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Some birds.\n\n0:32:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:56\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes, or sample sense, or yes?\n\n0:32:58\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, this one.\n\n0:32:59\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes, this one.\n\n0:33:00\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:33:01\tSPEAKER_05\n So, double cloud, yeah.\n\n0:33:08\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a high sea.\n\n0:33:10\tSPEAKER_05\n Double-carves.\n\n0:33:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it's going to be more than just the basic case, definitely.\n\n0:33:15\tSPEAKER_00\n So which one are we talking to?\n\n0:33:17\tSPEAKER_02\n How are you talking about this, that one?\n\n0:33:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, we are talking about it.\n\n0:33:20\tSPEAKER_05\n But they have the same shape.\n\n0:33:22\tSPEAKER_01\n The boat can be not basic cases.\n\n0:33:25\tSPEAKER_05\n So this would be double-carves?\n\n0:33:28\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:29\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:33:32\tSPEAKER_05\n A plastic would be a...\n\n0:33:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, the basic one.\n\n0:33:34\tSPEAKER_05\n Terrible.\n\n0:33:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Zero-french.\n\n0:33:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Special cover.\n\n0:33:41\tSPEAKER_05\n Special color, now we leave to the covers.\n\n0:33:45\tSPEAKER_01\n So now we're going bush button or LCD display?\n\n0:33:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:33:50\tSPEAKER_00\n I said this, but yeah.\n\n0:33:52\tSPEAKER_00\n It's okay.\n\n0:33:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's say LCD display.\n\n0:33:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Is that price per unit or for the whole?\n\n0:33:58\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, then this is per unit.\n\n0:34:00\tSPEAKER_05\n So, number of components.\n\n0:34:01\tSPEAKER_02\n So, we made need a scroll, we'll write for that.\n\n0:34:04\tSPEAKER_02\n No, for this one.\n\n0:34:05\tSPEAKER_02\n No, for that one also.\n\n0:34:07\tSPEAKER_00\n The author.\n\n0:34:08\tSPEAKER_00\n So, yeah, that's a scroll.\n\n0:34:10\tSPEAKER_05\n One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, eight, nine.\n\n0:34:17\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes, well, probably.\n\n0:34:20\tSPEAKER_05\n So this comes to 18.\n\n0:34:22\tSPEAKER_01\n And that's without any special button supplements.\n\n0:34:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, one scroll will leave me.\n\n0:34:27\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't really know what I've made.\n\n0:34:29\tSPEAKER_02\n So...\n\n0:34:30\tSPEAKER_01\n So we had special color, special form, special material, and all of them.\n\n0:34:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Don't understand about this.\n\n0:34:36\tSPEAKER_05\n So, I think...\n\n0:34:37\tSPEAKER_05\n But did we agree that it's...\n\n0:34:39\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not double curved, it's single curved, right?\n\n0:34:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Because there is no...\n\n0:34:45\tSPEAKER_01\n But I thought it would be curved on two.\n\n0:34:47\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's curved on the sides and curved on the top of the button as well.\n\n0:34:50\tSPEAKER_04\n And the time that's...\n\n0:34:52\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh.\n\n0:34:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Well...\n\n0:34:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes, I know this.\n\n0:34:55\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't expect what it means.\n\n0:34:57\tSPEAKER_00\n This...\n\n0:34:58\tSPEAKER_00\n There is only...\n\n0:35:01\tSPEAKER_00\n There is nothing like...\n\n0:35:04\tSPEAKER_00\n You know, in the other stuff...\n\n0:35:05\tSPEAKER_00\n You talk about concave?\n\n0:35:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, concave.\n\n0:35:07\tSPEAKER_00\n So I think we can put...\n\n0:35:09\tSPEAKER_01\n You think it's single curved?\n\n0:35:10\tSPEAKER_00\n It's single curved, like 16.\n\n0:35:13\tSPEAKER_00\n That makes 17.\n\n0:35:16\tSPEAKER_00\n And what else?\n\n0:35:18\tSPEAKER_00\n The buttons we have tried buttons, are you sure?\n\n0:35:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:22\tSPEAKER_01\n We have more, we've got the scroll on the side.\n\n0:35:25\tSPEAKER_00\n The bad...\n\n0:35:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Bad estimation.\n\n0:35:28\tSPEAKER_05\n We even talk about the LED, but that's not...\n\n0:35:32\tSPEAKER_05\n The LED is very inexpensive, I believe, but it's not in the list.\n\n0:35:36\tSPEAKER_01\n We've got a scroll wheel for the volume, don't we?\n\n0:35:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Or is it some other thing that's not on there?\n\n0:35:41\tSPEAKER_05\n If this is a scroll wheel or if this is a sort of button, which can be pressed on two sides, so for...\n\n0:35:47\tSPEAKER_05\n Iron areas.\n\n0:35:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, we've only got five minutes left, guys.\n\n0:35:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Let's drop it up pretty fast.\n\n0:35:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes, you can.\n\n0:35:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Score the wheel.\n\n0:36:02\tSPEAKER_01\n So this is even more than the...\n\n0:36:04\tSPEAKER_01\n In the costume game, the 16-year-olds?\n\n0:36:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so based on that, yeah.\n\n0:36:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Where is the...\n\n0:36:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Speed Journal.\n\n0:36:21\tSPEAKER_05\n That is the sample sensor and the sample speaker.\n\n0:36:24\tSPEAKER_00\n So...\n\n0:36:25\tSPEAKER_02\n We just need that, actually.\n\n0:36:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Where...\n\n0:36:31\tSPEAKER_02\n We need one.\n\n0:36:39\tSPEAKER_05\n We could go for a simple chip, but then we can have the...\n\n0:36:45\tSPEAKER_05\n Speed Track Nation, yes?\n\n0:36:48\tSPEAKER_00\n No, we cannot, yeah.\n\n0:36:50\tSPEAKER_00\n So when we...\n\n0:36:51\tSPEAKER_05\n But this would be cutting the Speed Track Nation.\n\n0:36:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but if you have the near-the-LCD, you can select between...\n\n0:37:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Universal between audio, TV and VCR.\n\n0:37:06\tSPEAKER_00\n And this needs an advanced chip.\n\n0:37:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Trans-tip.\n\n0:37:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:37:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Hi.\n\n0:37:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, are you a chip?\n\n0:37:13\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's going to be...\n\n0:37:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we can do that.\n\n0:37:17\tSPEAKER_05\n With the regular chip, yeah.\n\n0:37:19\tSPEAKER_05\n I can do that.\n\n0:37:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, still on 15, so.\n\n0:37:22\tSPEAKER_00\n So...\n\n0:37:23\tSPEAKER_00\n And what about the number of buttons?\n\n0:37:26\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes, that may be...\n\n0:37:28\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, we can just say...\n\n0:37:30\tSPEAKER_04\n Matthew.\n\n0:37:34\tSPEAKER_00\n When you look at this...\n\n0:37:37\tSPEAKER_00\n This item.\n\n0:37:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:42\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, we're just...\n\n0:37:44\tSPEAKER_05\n When we just want to cut the number of buttons, we have to make 7 to fit in 12, 12, 15.\n\n0:37:51\tSPEAKER_05\n So is it possible?\n\n0:37:53\tSPEAKER_01\n The 7 basic buttons, or 7 buttons that any adds on with a special colors or for more material.\n\n0:37:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Then we have to ask the user to place itself.\n\n0:38:03\tSPEAKER_00\n You're going to make a phone to your boss saying, 2050 is really...\n\n0:38:07\tSPEAKER_00\n No, no.\n\n0:38:10\tSPEAKER_01\n So, the LCD plays is three francs.\n\n0:38:14\tSPEAKER_01\n It's very three-year-olds by itself.\n\n0:38:16\tSPEAKER_00\n And we don't want to change that right.\n\n0:38:19\tSPEAKER_00\n We really want to add city, otherwise we would not get the market.\n\n0:38:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Otherwise, everything...\n\n0:38:25\tSPEAKER_05\n You are a very normal thing like this.\n\n0:38:29\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:30\tSPEAKER_01\n So, 12 euro 50.\n\n0:38:34\tSPEAKER_01\n We got two off of the battery.\n\n0:38:35\tSPEAKER_01\n We can't do anything about that.\n\n0:38:37\tSPEAKER_01\n So, 1050.\n\n0:38:38\tSPEAKER_01\n So, what else do you display?\n\n0:38:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Display. That's 750.\n\n0:38:43\tSPEAKER_01\n So, we've got 750 to use for the case and for the buttons.\n\n0:38:50\tSPEAKER_01\n And the chips.\n\n0:38:51\tSPEAKER_01\n So, the chips.\n\n0:38:52\tSPEAKER_04\n Up there already.\n\n0:38:55\tSPEAKER_01\n So, we're going to scale this down to get within budget.\n\n0:38:57\tSPEAKER_01\n There's no doubt about that.\n\n0:39:02\tSPEAKER_00\n So, what each other's thinking about the...\n\n0:39:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Because it's a major point in the LCD.\n\n0:39:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Do you think it's important?\n\n0:39:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, we could even replace them by buttons.\n\n0:39:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Because sometimes when you watch the TV, in fact, you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more on your hands.\n\n0:39:22\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know. I'm just asking.\n\n0:39:24\tSPEAKER_02\n It depends what kind of functionality you want to add into it.\n\n0:39:27\tSPEAKER_02\n For example, if you add two more functionality, then better you add two more buttons there.\n\n0:39:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Instead of LCD display.\n\n0:39:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Which is going to bring the cost by two.\n\n0:39:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Unless we can really drive these prices down, we need to get rid of the LCD display.\n\n0:39:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, so we can get rid of it and then add a couple of buttons.\n\n0:39:45\tSPEAKER_02\n We want that.\n\n0:39:48\tSPEAKER_00\n On the market point of view, what do you think LCD is a major feature?\n\n0:39:55\tSPEAKER_01\n For the price, it's going to be what we can afford.\n\n0:39:57\tSPEAKER_01\n And it's looking like we can't afford the LCD display.\n\n0:39:59\tSPEAKER_01\n There's no way we can get it in there.\n\n0:40:02\tSPEAKER_05\n I think we have to come to the decision now.\n\n0:40:05\tSPEAKER_05\n I think what we just do is fold about the LCD display.\n\n0:40:12\tSPEAKER_00\n You assume you want a democracy voice.\n\n0:40:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:40:16\tSPEAKER_05\n One man in one world.\n\n0:40:19\tSPEAKER_05\n So who thinks the LCD display would be in it?\n\n0:40:25\tSPEAKER_01\n I'd like to be in, but I can't see it happening.\n\n0:40:28\tSPEAKER_01\n I think we could.\n\n0:40:31\tSPEAKER_01\n You're a power voter of beta anyway as project manager.\n\n0:40:35\tSPEAKER_02\n But the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that?\n\n0:40:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we have to make decision now.\n\n0:40:44\tSPEAKER_05\n So having an LCD display is just have very limited amount of buttons.\n\n0:40:51\tSPEAKER_05\n Is that acceptable?\n\n0:40:53\tSPEAKER_05\n Can you function to be implemented?\n\n0:40:56\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:40:58\tSPEAKER_05\n You agree.\n\n0:41:01\tSPEAKER_05\n So having seven buttons instead of 12.\n\n0:41:04\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:41:05\tSPEAKER_05\n So it would be cutting, cutting, say about these buttons.\n\n0:41:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Because one, yeah, show me that.\n\n0:41:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Actually, we could, in fact, remove these three buttons and have three possibilities for each of the three here.\n\n0:41:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Here one at the middle and at the bottom.\n\n0:41:25\tSPEAKER_01\n I think we're really losing ease of use.\n\n0:41:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:41:29\tSPEAKER_02\n That really could be another problem for the people to use it.\n\n0:41:33\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not going to be easy.\n\n0:41:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:41:36\tSPEAKER_05\n So I think we should, we should cut the LCD screen.\n\n0:41:40\tSPEAKER_05\n That's my opinion.\n\n0:41:42\tSPEAKER_05\n No, it's okay.\n\n0:41:43\tSPEAKER_02\n You cut the LCD screen and introduce two more buttons.\n\n0:41:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:41:48\tSPEAKER_01\n So LCD is out.\n\n0:41:49\tSPEAKER_01\n The speech record now?\n\n0:41:50\tSPEAKER_00\n The speech recognition is out.\n\n0:41:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:41:53\tSPEAKER_05\n Where else?\n\n0:41:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Because of the budget.\n\n0:41:56\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:41:57\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:41:58\tSPEAKER_05\n Now we can just...\n\n0:42:00\tSPEAKER_01\n So are we basically back to the original one now?\n\n0:42:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Back to the first version.\n\n0:42:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Which turns out to be on budget exactly pretty much.\n\n0:42:08\tSPEAKER_01\n With these new costings.\n\n0:42:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:42:11\tSPEAKER_01\n So just look at, forget that one and look at that one now.\n\n0:42:13\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:42:14\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:42:15\tSPEAKER_05\n I think we just go for this one.\n\n0:42:16\tSPEAKER_05\n That now 12 euros is there.\n\n0:42:19\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:20\tSPEAKER_05\n It's the price.\n\n0:42:21\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:42:22\tSPEAKER_05\n So we glad that it's 50 cents cheaper than actually.\n\n0:42:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:26\tSPEAKER_00\n So we don't need really expert designers.\n\n0:42:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Because they're home.\n\n0:42:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:34\tSPEAKER_01\n So we can go back and talk to the suppliers and they'll see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in.\n\n0:42:39\tSPEAKER_01\n But that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment.\n\n0:42:42\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:42:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Good.\n\n0:42:44\tSPEAKER_05\n Then we have for this hang.\n\n0:42:45\tSPEAKER_04\n Thank you.\n\n0:42:46\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:42:47\tSPEAKER_04\n That was it.\n\n0:42:48\tSPEAKER_04\n That's it.\n\n0:42:49\tNone\n Thanks.\n\n0:42:50\tNone\n Cool.\n\n0:42:51\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:42:52\tNone\n Uh-oh.\n\n0:42:53\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:43:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:43:12\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:43:22\tNone\n Find the design\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "None will present their designs.
