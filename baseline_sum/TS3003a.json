places.\n\n0:00:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Everybody's sitting on the right place.\n\n0:00:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's see.\n\n0:00:36\tSPEAKER_00\n First I'll introduce myself.\n\n0:00:38\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know if everybody knows me.\n\n0:00:40\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm Bart.\n\n0:00:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Hello.\n\n0:00:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Hello.\n\n0:00:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Bart.\n\n0:00:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Hello.\n\n0:00:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Hello.\n\n0:00:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Hello.\n\n0:00:47\tNone\n Bart.\n\n0:00:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Welcome.\n\n0:00:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Thank you.\n\n0:00:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's see.\n\n0:00:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's start off with a little presentation.\n\n0:01:05\tSPEAKER_00\n First I'll tell you a little bit about the setting.\n\n0:01:08\tSPEAKER_00\n You can see the few cameras here.\n\n0:01:10\tSPEAKER_00\n They'll record our actions.\n\n0:01:13\tSPEAKER_00\n And you all have wires and microphones.\n\n0:01:16\tSPEAKER_00\n They will record your voice.\n\n0:01:18\tSPEAKER_00\n There are also some microphones there.\n\n0:01:20\tSPEAKER_00\n But you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those, because it will disappear when you don't intend to do it.\n\n0:01:30\tSPEAKER_00\n So this is our project documents folder.\n\n0:01:34\tSPEAKER_00\n There are some notes you need already.\n\n0:01:36\tSPEAKER_00\n I see some documents.\n\n0:01:39\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll start with the presentation kickoff.\n\n0:01:47\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a great experience.\n\n0:01:54\tSPEAKER_00\n It's been modified by the administrator.\n\n0:01:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's do it read only.\n\n0:02:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, I don't know if you've noticed, but we are working for real reaction.\n\n0:02:07\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a company in electronics.\n\n0:02:10\tSPEAKER_00\n We put fashion in electronics.\n\n0:02:13\tSPEAKER_00\n We make it work.\n\n0:02:15\tSPEAKER_00\n in Bartbaute and Project Manager.\n\n0:02:16\tSPEAKER_00\n So I'll direct you through the project.\n\n0:02:20\tSPEAKER_00\n This is our agenda.\n\n0:02:23\tSPEAKER_00\n We have our opening acquaintance tool training project plan discussion closing.\n\n0:02:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe I can sit down.\n\n0:02:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Then I can take some notes or let's see.\n\n0:02:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while.\n\n0:02:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Sure.\n\n0:02:44\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:02:45\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not a lot of work.\n\n0:02:46\tSPEAKER_00\n If you hear something, you can write down.\n\n0:02:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Just write it down.\n\n0:02:52\tSPEAKER_00\n As you can see, it's the opening acquaintance tool training acquaintance.\n\n0:02:55\tSPEAKER_00\n This is a point we've done a bit.\n\n0:02:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Have you all seen the corporate website already?\n\n0:03:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Have you seen any flaws in it?\n\n0:03:07\tSPEAKER_00\n I think I found one.\n\n0:03:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Can't say I paid much attention to it, but.\n\n0:03:13\tSPEAKER_00\n I can see if it works.\n\n0:03:16\tSPEAKER_00\n This one.\n\n0:03:17\tSPEAKER_00\n No, it doesn't work here.\n\n0:03:20\tSPEAKER_00\n OK, no problem.\n\n0:03:23\tSPEAKER_00\n But on the corporate information side, there was real remote instead of real reaction.\n\n0:03:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:03:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Real remote is not really the company we are, but it's just a little.\n\n0:03:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Beautiful.\n\n0:03:40\tSPEAKER_00\n OK, what are we going to do?\n\n0:03:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Our project aim is, as you can see, a new remote control.\n\n0:03:47\tSPEAKER_00\n It has to be original, trendy, and user-friendly.\n\n0:03:51\tSPEAKER_00\n So these are the points where we also hired you.\n\n0:03:58\tSPEAKER_00\n We've got the marketing expert for the trendy and user-friendly look and industrial designer.\n\n0:04:10\tSPEAKER_00\n That's also user-friendly and a bit original.\n\n0:04:13\tSPEAKER_00\n And we've got our user interface designer.\n\n0:04:17\tSPEAKER_00\n So that's about the new remote control.\n\n0:04:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Project method is there are three phases we're going through.\n\n0:04:30\tSPEAKER_00\n First is functional design, individual work meetings.\n\n0:04:35\tSPEAKER_00\n After the functional design, then the conceptual design and the detailed design, I had some real indications on here.\n\n0:04:48\tSPEAKER_00\n But I think you know it already by yourself.\n\n0:04:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Industrial designer is going to work on the working design, components design, and a bit of the look and feel design.\n\n0:05:01\tSPEAKER_00\n The user interface designer is going to do the technical function design, user interface concept, and user interface design.\n\n0:05:11\tSPEAKER_00\n And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirements, specification, trend-watching, and project-evaluation.\n\n0:05:21\tSPEAKER_00\n So that's a bit what you're going to do.\n\n0:05:24\tSPEAKER_00\n But that will be all worked out in other meetings.\n\n0:05:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Then we've got our first tool training.\n\n0:05:35\tSPEAKER_00\n We're going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here.\n\n0:05:38\tSPEAKER_00\n So it's handy if we have a little bit of training first.\n\n0:05:42\tSPEAKER_00\n As you can see, we've got the smart boards here and here and the white boards.\n\n0:05:50\tSPEAKER_00\n In the white board here, there's a little toolbar on this side.\n\n0:05:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Here are some functions we can save.\n\n0:05:58\tSPEAKER_00\n These functions we don't have anything to do with.\n\n0:06:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Only undo you can do a little piece of drawing.\n\n0:06:05\tSPEAKER_00\n A blank new document for each person.\n\n0:06:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Select a pen, razor, capture, redone, that's to do anything with.\n\n0:06:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Then we've got our pen, this pen.\n\n0:06:20\tSPEAKER_00\n It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page.\n\n0:06:24\tSPEAKER_00\n In the, I think it is formal.\n\n0:06:29\tSPEAKER_00\n You can also select the current color and the line with.\n\n0:06:33\tSPEAKER_00\n With that first, you have to select the pen function.\n\n0:06:36\tSPEAKER_00\n We're going to work with it in a minute.\n\n0:06:39\tSPEAKER_00\n So, okay.\n\n0:06:43\tSPEAKER_00\n That's very simple and it's easy to draw your findings and drawings on there.\n\n0:06:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Then, a short thing about documents.\n\n0:06:55\tSPEAKER_00\n We've got our shared folder, project, project documents, I think.\n\n0:07:01\tSPEAKER_00\n But all you all found that already because there are a lot of documents you need already, so that will be okay.\n\n0:07:08\tSPEAKER_00\n These are available on the smart boards as well.\n\n0:07:12\tSPEAKER_00\n So, if you have a document you want to show, just open it from the folder.\n\n0:07:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Here is the simple toolbar.\n\n0:07:20\tSPEAKER_00\n It's what I just said.\n\n0:07:21\tSPEAKER_00\n It's safe, print, move back or forward, one page.\n\n0:07:26\tSPEAKER_00\n You can switch between the different drawings.\n\n0:07:32\tSPEAKER_00\n And then we're going to try out the whiteboard.\n\n0:07:36\tSPEAKER_00\n So, as you can see, we go to draw an animal just to get a bit familiar with it.\n\n0:07:47\tSPEAKER_00\n I was supposed to run away.\n\n0:07:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Is everybody playing with the mouse?\n\n0:07:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay. We're going to draw an animal.\n\n0:07:58\tSPEAKER_00\n And just sum up a few of its favorite characteristics.\n\n0:08:05\tSPEAKER_00\n The only thing we have to look after is that we use different colors and different lines with this.\n\n0:08:13\tSPEAKER_00\n I can start from now.\n\n0:08:17\tSPEAKER_00\n You can use this pen by holding it like a little child because if you hold it like this, the sensors will get blocked and the drawing won't get good.\n\n0:08:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Another thing is you have to be a bit slow because if you're going to draw it really fast, then the pen won't hold up.\n\n0:08:38\tSPEAKER_00\n So, we choose Format, current color.\n\n0:08:43\tSPEAKER_00\n I think gray is appropriate.\n\n0:08:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Then the line width.\n\n0:08:51\tSPEAKER_00\n I think 7 will be nice.\n\n0:08:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Now you will see my drawing capabilities.\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_00\n There's another very much.\n\n0:09:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Here I have to do it real slow.\n\n0:09:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, listen.\n\n0:09:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Shark.\n\n0:09:29\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm trying to draw a dolphin.\n\n0:09:33\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's not as stupid as it is.\n\n0:09:37\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm thinking about a short fish.\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a bit of a short fish.\n\n0:09:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Now we've got another function.\n\n0:09:48\tSPEAKER_00\n We've got the eraser.\n\n0:09:51\tSPEAKER_00\n And then you can do this easily.\n\n0:09:58\tSPEAKER_00\n I've got to write down a few of his characteristics.\n\n0:10:06\tSPEAKER_00\n You've got no text tool.\n\n0:10:13\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:10:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:10:29\tSPEAKER_00\n This is typically a do-action, I think.\n\n0:10:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe I have to hold it a bit upside down.\n\n0:10:44\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that's it because if you are going to do it like this, then it will be a stripe.\n\n0:10:50\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:10:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Just trying.\n\n0:10:57\tSPEAKER_00\n This is not my work.\n\n0:11:04\tNone\n Maybe I have to use it.\n\n0:11:09\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's wants to draw another animal.\n\n0:11:31\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's going to be a little bit more difficult to draw a dolphin.\n\n0:11:42\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's going to be a little bit more difficult to draw a dolphin.\n\n0:11:49\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's going to be a little bit more difficult to draw a dolphin.\n\n0:12:04\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's going to be a little bit more difficult to draw a dolphin.\n\n0:12:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:12:20\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not much an artist, but here we go.\n\n0:12:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe it's easier to draw a smaller line with, I think.\n\n0:12:28\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's going a lot better than I did.\n\n0:12:46\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's going to be a little bit more difficult to draw a dolphin.\n\n0:13:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:13:25\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's going to be a little bit more difficult to draw a dolphin.\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_00\n It's nice.\n\n0:13:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Of course.\n\n0:13:49\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a real dead sheep.\n\n0:13:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe you can also write your name somewhere.\n\n0:14:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Let's go really slow when you're writing.\n\n0:14:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:38\tSPEAKER_01\n They're brilliant animals, and that's just a little me thing.\n\n0:14:45\tSPEAKER_01\n I guess I'll pass the pen to her.\n\n0:14:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:14:49\tSPEAKER_01\n It's using the face design.\n\n0:14:51\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm just going to draw its head.\n\n0:14:58\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:15:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:15:37\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:16:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Sweet.\n\n0:16:12\tSPEAKER_01\n You know what that is?\n\n0:16:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Garfield.\n\n0:16:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Garfield.\n\n0:16:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I was going to draw a cat too, so I'll just try something else.\n\n0:16:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Something different than Garfield.\n\n0:17:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Mine is a bit more skinny.\n\n0:17:23\tSPEAKER_01\n But what about the most interesting tool?\n\n0:17:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Is it your cat or did you find him on the street?\n\n0:17:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, it's supposed to be a cat.\n\n0:17:39\tSPEAKER_01\n I like cats because they are right.\n\n0:17:46\tSPEAKER_01\n They are right.\n\n0:17:53\tSPEAKER_01\n They are right.\n\n0:18:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:18:03\tSPEAKER_00\n That's pretty clear.\n\n0:18:04\tSPEAKER_00\n So everybody knows how to work with the wideboard now.\n\n0:18:07\tSPEAKER_00\n So if you have any ideas or if you want to draw anything on the wideboard, just ask and go ahead.\n\n0:18:14\tSPEAKER_00\n It's pretty easy.\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:18:23\tSPEAKER_00\n We're being honed.\n\n0:18:26\tSPEAKER_00\n So we've got the tool introduction.\n\n0:18:30\tSPEAKER_00\n We move along to the project finance.\n\n0:18:36\tSPEAKER_00\n As you can see, for remote control, a selling price is 25 euros.\n\n0:18:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Our selling price.\n\n0:18:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Our profit aim is 50 million euros.\n\n0:18:49\tSPEAKER_00\n That's the least we have to get from our remote controls.\n\n0:18:53\tSPEAKER_00\n So we have to work together to reach our aims.\n\n0:18:57\tSPEAKER_00\n We can do it international.\n\n0:18:59\tSPEAKER_00\n So we have to focus on different kind of users, different kind of cultures, and different kind of trends as well.\n\n0:19:08\tSPEAKER_00\n But that's all in the later stadium.\n\n0:19:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Our production cost can be maximal 12.5 euros.\n\n0:19:18\tSPEAKER_00\n So that's also a point we have to keep in mind that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside and stuff like that.\n\n0:19:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Point work.\n\n0:19:30\tSPEAKER_00\n So just try to remember these points.\n\n0:19:33\tSPEAKER_00\n The selling price is 25 profit aims, 50 million, but more important is the international market we're trying to focus on.\n\n0:19:43\tSPEAKER_00\n And production cost, maximal 12.5 euros.\n\n0:19:48\tSPEAKER_00\n So that leads us to our little discussion.\n\n0:19:52\tSPEAKER_00\n We've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion.\n\n0:19:57\tSPEAKER_00\n So I'm going to sit down and think.\n\n0:20:00\tSPEAKER_00\n It's easier.\n\n0:20:02\tSPEAKER_00\n I've got a message.\n\n0:20:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Five minutes.\n\n0:20:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay. That's a good timing.\n\n0:20:09\tSPEAKER_01\n So just on the side note, why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen?\n\n0:20:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe you have to say to make your grid.\n\n0:20:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Does it do anything?\n\n0:20:22\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:20:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe you have to just clap it down.\n\n0:20:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Back up again.\n\n0:20:33\tSPEAKER_01\n It's off.\n\n0:20:36\tSPEAKER_00\n It's off.\n\n0:20:37\tSPEAKER_00\n I have to put it back.\n\n0:20:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:39\tSPEAKER_00\n It'll be okay.\n\n0:20:40\tSPEAKER_01\n What was on?\n\n0:20:43\tSPEAKER_00\n It's those laptops.\n\n0:20:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Nice.\n\n0:20:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:20:49\tSPEAKER_00\n But, so, this everybody has experiences with remote controls.\n\n0:20:56\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, not the ordinary remote controls, but also a little bit different ones.\n\n0:21:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Like you can use for other.\n\n0:21:05\tSPEAKER_01\n No way.\n\n0:21:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we're on the other.\n\n0:21:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Kind of brought TV at home.\n\n0:21:11\tSPEAKER_01\n And the DVD player.\n\n0:21:13\tSPEAKER_01\n So we got like a lot of remote controls.\n\n0:21:16\tSPEAKER_01\n One for the TV, one for the video recorder, one for the DVD player.\n\n0:21:20\tSPEAKER_01\n And I think it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate the mall.\n\n0:21:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I've got one at home.\n\n0:21:27\tSPEAKER_00\n And you can program, I think, eight different devices in it.\n\n0:21:32\tSPEAKER_00\n And you can use it for your television.\n\n0:21:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Anything else.\n\n0:21:36\tSPEAKER_00\n And it also operates on infrared.\n\n0:21:38\tSPEAKER_00\n So you have to got a little device inside your room.\n\n0:21:42\tSPEAKER_00\n And then you can operate it from the third or second floor.\n\n0:21:48\tSPEAKER_00\n So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or DVD player downstairs.\n\n0:21:53\tSPEAKER_00\n And you've got a link to your TV on the second floor.\n\n0:21:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:57\tSPEAKER_00\n So that's a pretty handy thing.\n\n0:22:02\tSPEAKER_00\n But only the, I think, if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, the next is a lot easier as well.\n\n0:22:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:14\tSPEAKER_00\n It's good to remember.\n\n0:22:17\tSPEAKER_01\n So I think you can take minutes again.\n\n0:22:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:20\tSPEAKER_00\n It's nice.\n\n0:22:21\tSPEAKER_00\n So we want different functions.\n\n0:22:24\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:25\tSPEAKER_00\n And we can maybe see if we can do something with infrared.\n\n0:22:33\tSPEAKER_00\n But I don't know if that will exceed the production cost.\n\n0:22:36\tSPEAKER_00\n So there's something we have to find out, I think.\n\n0:22:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:40\tSPEAKER_01\n But that would be really good if we could do that.\n\n0:22:45\tSPEAKER_00\n And other functions for remote control.\n\n0:22:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe we can make it the, it has to be sharp proof.\n\n0:22:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:22:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Sharp proof.\n\n0:22:58\tSPEAKER_01\n My remote control tends to follow a lot.\n\n0:23:01\tSPEAKER_01\n So should never know.\n\n0:23:04\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, what I prove.\n\n0:23:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:23:10\tSPEAKER_00\n So these are a few things we can think of.\n\n0:23:15\tSPEAKER_00\n I will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder.\n\n0:23:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, one other little thing.\n\n0:23:23\tSPEAKER_01\n I thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it.\n\n0:23:27\tSPEAKER_01\n So we can see the battery status.\n\n0:23:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:23:30\tSPEAKER_01\n How much is left in the battery?\n\n0:23:33\tSPEAKER_01\n But they'll also really drag up the production costs.\n\n0:23:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:38\tSPEAKER_01\n We'll have to see about that too.\n\n0:23:41\tSPEAKER_01\n But maybe just a little bit.\n\n0:23:45\tSPEAKER_00\n
