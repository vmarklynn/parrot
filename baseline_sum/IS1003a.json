I'm Adalungman.\n\n0:01:28\tSPEAKER_03\n And has you may know it.\n\n0:01:30\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm the project manager.\n\n0:01:34\tSPEAKER_03\n So...\n\n0:01:37\tSPEAKER_03\n We will have to...\n\n0:01:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Speak about the project.\n\n0:01:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Our project is to create a new remote control.\n\n0:01:49\tSPEAKER_03\n And as you may know, there's a lot of industrials, interesting in creating and remote control.\n\n0:01:56\tSPEAKER_03\n So the remote control has to be original, trendy, and user friendly.\n\n0:02:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Record.\n\n0:02:11\tSPEAKER_03\n So the project method is the following.\n\n0:02:15\tSPEAKER_03\n So for the functional design, you have to do individual work.\n\n0:02:22\tSPEAKER_03\n And also work with meetings, talking with each other.\n\n0:02:31\tSPEAKER_03\n It will be the same for the conceptual design, and also the same for the detailed design.\n\n0:02:44\tSPEAKER_03\n The tool training is to try out the whiteboard.\n\n0:02:48\tSPEAKER_02\n So...\n\n0:02:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe you can draw your favorite animal.\n\n0:02:56\tSPEAKER_03\n And make a list of its favorite characteristics.\n\n0:03:01\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know if we have to do that.\n\n0:03:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe we'll do it later.\n\n0:03:08\tSPEAKER_03\n So the selling price of the project will be 25 euros.\n\n0:03:13\tSPEAKER_03\n 25 euros.\n\n0:03:15\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it's quite good price.\n\n0:03:18\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a wonderful thing.\n\n0:03:21\tNone\n And...\n\n0:03:24\tSPEAKER_03\n It will be an international remote control, as we want to sell it in the entire world.\n\n0:03:34\tSPEAKER_03\n And the product costs will be more than 12 euros and 50 centims.\n\n0:03:42\tSPEAKER_03\n So, as you will discuss about the remote control, you will have to experience your weather remote control.\n\n0:03:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Just maybe be imaginative with the remote control.\n\n0:03:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Try to create something new, and people would like to buy.\n\n0:04:07\tSPEAKER_03\n And the next meeting will start in 30 minutes.\n\n0:04:14\tSPEAKER_03\n So you all have your specific role.\n\n0:04:19\tSPEAKER_03\n And I suppose you know what you have to do.\n\n0:04:23\tSPEAKER_03\n And you will have to work on the design.\n\n0:04:27\tSPEAKER_03\n And also to work on the design of technical functions of the remote control.\n\n0:04:34\tSPEAKER_03\n And think of the user requirements specifications.\n\n0:04:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Those things just refer to each of us.\n\n0:04:42\tSPEAKER_00\n I think.\n\n0:04:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:04:44\tSPEAKER_00\n ME and...\n\n0:04:45\tSPEAKER_03\n ID.\n\n0:04:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:04:47\tSPEAKER_02\n ID is for the industrial designer.\n\n0:04:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:04:50\tSPEAKER_02\n And you ID it for the user interface designer.\n\n0:04:53\tSPEAKER_00\n It's me.\n\n0:04:54\tSPEAKER_02\n And marketing experts, it's me.\n\n0:04:56\tSPEAKER_03\n So I will manage all the group.\n\n0:04:58\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll take a manager of this year.\n\n0:05:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Good.\n\n0:05:02\tSPEAKER_03\n So you have questions?\n\n0:05:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Not really.\n\n0:05:11\tSPEAKER_03\n So you will know what the parts of the work you have to do.\n\n0:05:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:16\tSPEAKER_00\n So which, you, the industrial designer?\n\n0:05:18\tSPEAKER_00\n I am the industrial designer.\n\n0:05:20\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm the user interface designer.\n\n0:05:22\tSPEAKER_03\n And you?\n\n0:05:23\tSPEAKER_02\n I am the industrial designer.\n\n0:05:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:05:27\tSPEAKER_01\n So what's the difference between...\n\n0:05:30\tSPEAKER_01\n You are the interface designer.\n\n0:05:32\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, you have to know.\n\n0:05:33\tSPEAKER_00\n That's your design.\n\n0:05:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Ah.\n\n0:05:35\tSPEAKER_00\n It's your job.\n\n0:05:36\tSPEAKER_00\n I hope you know what it is.\n\n0:05:39\tSPEAKER_02\n You know very soon.\n\n0:05:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:42\tSPEAKER_01\n I think so.\n\n0:05:43\tSPEAKER_03\n I suppose you have to design it.\n\n0:05:45\tSPEAKER_03\n And you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it.\n\n0:05:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:05:50\tSPEAKER_01\n So I make a user interface.\n\n0:05:51\tSPEAKER_01\n You...\n\n0:05:52\tSPEAKER_01\n And maybe you will just form it.\n\n0:05:55\tSPEAKER_02\n I think the user interface design is...\n\n0:05:59\tSPEAKER_02\n You will design how the user will...\n\n0:06:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Use the relation between the user and...\n\n0:06:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Make...\n\n0:06:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:05\tSPEAKER_02\n And the industrial designer, it is how the object will look like.\n\n0:06:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe I think...\n\n0:06:11\tSPEAKER_01\n So the material...\n\n0:06:12\tSPEAKER_01\n You must be designed...\n\n0:06:13\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a function design.\n\n0:06:14\tSPEAKER_01\n I designed the user interface.\n\n0:06:16\tSPEAKER_01\n You designed the function.\n\n0:06:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe.\n\n0:06:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Just the outside and the inside.\n\n0:06:21\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:06:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:06:26\tSPEAKER_02\n But I was thinking that it is a user interface to design for example.\n\n0:06:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Whereas the button will be...\n\n0:06:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:33\tSPEAKER_02\n But I don't know.\n\n0:06:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:06:35\tSPEAKER_00\n You know.\n\n0:06:36\tSPEAKER_02\n So I am the industrial designer.\n\n0:06:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:06:39\tSPEAKER_02\n You know the other one.\n\n0:06:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:06:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:06:42\tSPEAKER_02\n So the marketing expert will...\n\n0:06:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:46\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm just...\n\n0:06:47\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and...\n\n0:06:50\tSPEAKER_00\n What the users would like to have.\n\n0:06:52\tSPEAKER_00\n And then...\n\n0:06:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:54\tSPEAKER_00\n I guess, converge to the user interface designer.\n\n0:06:57\tSPEAKER_00\n And then...\n\n0:06:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Industrial designer.\n\n0:06:59\tSPEAKER_03\n And when designing the remote control, just remember that it has to be a kind of international product.\n\n0:07:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:07:06\tSPEAKER_03\n So you don't have to do something really specific.\n\n0:07:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Mm-hmm.\n\n0:07:10\tSPEAKER_03\n As everybody will have to use it.\n\n0:07:12\tSPEAKER_03\n It's the same as keyboards.\n\n0:07:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:14\tSPEAKER_03\n You know, you have Quarty, Aziti, French, and UK keyboard.\n\n0:07:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:18\tSPEAKER_03\n So really the remote control to be international.\n\n0:07:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:07:22\tSPEAKER_03\n And not too expensive.\n\n0:07:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Add the simple.\n\n0:07:26\tSPEAKER_00\n As we want to maximize the benefit.\n\n0:07:28\tSPEAKER_00\n And you have to keep it under 12 euros and...\n\n0:07:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:31\tSPEAKER_03\n You have to keep in mind that...\n\n0:07:33\tSPEAKER_03\n The product cost won't be maximum.\n\n0:07:35\tSPEAKER_03\n More than 12.50 euros.\n\n0:07:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:07:40\tSPEAKER_03\n And to be sure that really people would be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the existing remote control now.\n\n0:07:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:07:52\tSPEAKER_03\n So is it okay?\n\n0:07:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Mm-hmm.\n\n0:07:56\tSPEAKER_00\n It's clear.\n\n0:07:58\tSPEAKER_02\n There was a step about rolling something in the world.\n\n0:08:03\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know.\n\n0:08:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, maybe you should go and roll an animal.\n\n0:08:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Is it?\n\n0:08:07\tSPEAKER_02\n I was supposed to do it right now.\n\n0:08:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, you try.\n\n0:08:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Try for us.\n\n0:08:11\tSPEAKER_02\n It's from the left.\n\n0:08:12\tSPEAKER_02\n It's...\n\n0:08:13\tSPEAKER_03\n You think we have to do it now?\n\n0:08:15\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't...\n\n0:08:16\tSPEAKER_02\n I was thinking, but I'm not sure.\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_02\n You can draw something.\n\n0:08:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Which is worse than...\n\n0:08:22\tSPEAKER_01\n You want me to draw something?\n\n0:08:24\tSPEAKER_01\n But did you manage it?\n\n0:08:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, we should go.\n\n0:08:26\tSPEAKER_03\n We should go.\n\n0:08:27\tSPEAKER_03\n We should go.\n\n0:08:28\tSPEAKER_01\n We should go.\n\n0:08:29\tSPEAKER_01\n We should go.\n\n0:08:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Cam is really good at drawing.\n\n0:08:31\tSPEAKER_02\n I think everybody should do it.\n\n0:08:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:34\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not too hard.\n\n0:08:36\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a good visual.\n\n0:08:43\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a good visual.\n\n0:08:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, it's the same as mine.\n\n0:08:56\tSPEAKER_01\n What's this?\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a cat.\n\n0:09:01\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a fat cat.\n\n0:09:02\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not a fat cat.\n\n0:09:09\tSPEAKER_00\n That's the fat cat, okay?\n\n0:09:10\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a cat who...\n\n0:09:13\tSPEAKER_01\n...wrapped it.\n\n0:09:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, we got it.\n\n0:09:16\tSPEAKER_01\n We got it.\n\n0:09:17\tSPEAKER_00\n A rat?\n\n0:09:18\tSPEAKER_00\n It's difficult.\n\n0:09:19\tSPEAKER_02\n You have to draw a rat if you want a rat.\n\n0:09:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Mouse is not difficult.\n\n0:09:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Mouse is okay.\n\n0:09:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Just go, you're the closest to the whiteboard.\n\n0:09:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Go to the whiteboard and draw.\n\n0:09:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Everybody has to draw.\n\n0:09:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, I draw.\n\n0:09:36\tSPEAKER_01\n It's the only thing I can draw is the axis.\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh.\n\n0:09:42\tSPEAKER_01\n No, duck.\n\n0:09:45\tSPEAKER_02\n No, what is...\n\n0:09:48\tSPEAKER_01\n No, I...\n\n0:09:49\tSPEAKER_00\n You are the eyes.\n\n0:09:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that was the eyes.\n\n0:09:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:09:55\tSPEAKER_03\n A clown.\n\n0:09:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Rabbit?\n\n0:09:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:59\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a rabbit.\n\n0:10:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:10:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Bucks Bunny one.\n\n0:10:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, it's not so bad.\n\n0:10:16\tSPEAKER_00\n The only thing I can draw is because it's very simple.\n\n0:10:21\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:10:22\tSPEAKER_01\n I go.\n\n0:10:29\tSPEAKER_00\n This is a friend of you.\n\n0:10:32\tNone\n What?\n\n0:10:33\tNone\n The train.\n\n0:10:34\tNone\n So what else?\n\n0:10:36\tSPEAKER_03\n This was my favorite one.\n\n0:10:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Thank you.\n\n0:10:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Thank you.\n\n0:10:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Thank you.\n\n0:10:48\tSPEAKER_03\n A fish?\n\n0:10:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:10:56\tSPEAKER_02\n That's a fish.\n\n0:11:00\tSPEAKER_03\n I forgot the chips.\n\n0:11:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:11:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Doesn't look so fine.\n\n0:11:08\tSPEAKER_02\n I should be very careful.\n\n0:11:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Fish and chips.\n\n0:11:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:11:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Shooter.\n\n0:11:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, it's my turn.\n\n0:11:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Beautiful.\n\n0:11:21\tNone\n Shooter.\n\n0:11:24\tSPEAKER_02\n What's wrong with you?\n\n0:11:27\tSPEAKER_01\n The power.\n\n0:11:29\tSPEAKER_01\n The power.\n\n0:11:30\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a...\n\n0:11:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Shooter.\n\n0:11:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Can I draw somewhere?\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, TT.\n\n0:11:44\tSPEAKER_01\n TT?\n\n0:11:46\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:11:54\tNone\n Oh.\n\n0:11:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh.\n\n0:11:56\tNone\n Oh.\n\n0:11:58\tNone\n Oh.\n\n0:12:09\tSPEAKER_02\n I think I...\n\n0:12:13\tSPEAKER_02\n It's my favorite.\n\n0:12:16\tSPEAKER_02\n It's my favorite.\n\n0:12:20\tSPEAKER_00\n A person?\n\n0:12:27\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:12:28\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a very crazy dog.\n\n0:12:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a dog in a village.\n\n0:12:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_02\n So what are we going to do now?\n\n0:12:55\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's done.\n\n0:12:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it's done.\n\n0:12:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:13:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Just to...\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Present project.\n\n0:13:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Discuss a little bit about it.\n\n0:13:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, my God.\n\n0:13:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, we have 25 minutes for the meeting.\n\n0:13:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:13:13\tSPEAKER_00\n So if you have questions...\n\n0:13:16\tSPEAKER_00\n What time is it?\n\n0:13:22\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_03\n It's okay.\n\n0:13:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it's okay.\n\n0:13:27\tSPEAKER_03\n You know your job.\n\n0:13:28\tSPEAKER_03\n You know your job.\n\n0:13:29\tSPEAKER_02\n I have a nightmare job.\n\n0:13:31\tSPEAKER_02\n I have a nightmare for my job to...\n\n0:13:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:13:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:13:38\tNone\n Good.\n\n0:13:41\tNone\n Oh.\n\n0:13:44\tNone\n Is it good?\n\n0:13:47\tNone\n Hmm.\n\n0:13:50\tNone\n Isn't it?\n\n0:13:53\tNone\n Where is this supposed to be?\n\n0:13:58\tNone\n
