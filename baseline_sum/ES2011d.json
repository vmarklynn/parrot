So, that's just...\n\n0:03:47\tSPEAKER_02\n The beeper is also inside there too, somewhere.\n\n0:03:49\tSPEAKER_02\n So, you have to have a button on your...\n\n0:03:51\tSPEAKER_02\n You have to attach the button to the...\n\n0:03:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, we didn't design that.\n\n0:03:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we have that...\n\n0:03:55\tSPEAKER_02\n But it would be coordinating with that.\n\n0:03:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:03:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Hit that...\n\n0:04:00\tSPEAKER_02\n You know, match the handset.\n\n0:04:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Get up the broccoli.\n\n0:04:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Mango.\n\n0:04:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Ta-da.\n\n0:04:08\tSPEAKER_01\n If you want to look in your project documents folder, there's a Excel spreadsheet.\n\n0:04:20\tSPEAKER_01\n The only one that's in there, production costs.\n\n0:04:25\tSPEAKER_01\n And if you open it up, I've just stuck the numbers in.\n\n0:04:29\tSPEAKER_01\n There's a real challenge there.\n\n0:04:31\tSPEAKER_01\n But if I missed anything that we've gone over, or if you see something in that, it has changed.\n\n0:04:39\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, we decided on batteries.\n\n0:04:41\tSPEAKER_01\n And the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button.\n\n0:04:52\tSPEAKER_01\n I said, Uncurved or flat.\n\n0:04:55\tSPEAKER_01\n I think that's what you have there.\n\n0:04:57\tSPEAKER_01\n For the plastic part would be...\n\n0:04:59\tSPEAKER_02\n My impression was that flat meant like one of the square remotes.\n\n0:05:03\tSPEAKER_02\n But it's really not very clear.\n\n0:05:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Because you've got single curve and double curve.\n\n0:05:08\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know what that means.\n\n0:05:10\tSPEAKER_02\n One side is curved and then the other side is curved.\n\n0:05:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, if we're talking about the area just...\n\n0:05:20\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:05:21\tSPEAKER_01\n I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see.\n\n0:05:28\tSPEAKER_01\n So what else?\n\n0:05:29\tSPEAKER_01\n There's plastic for that area around the button.\n\n0:05:33\tSPEAKER_01\n And then rubber would be the squishy, like saying, right?\n\n0:05:38\tSPEAKER_01\n And lots of special colors, actually.\n\n0:05:43\tSPEAKER_01\n School wheel.\n\n0:05:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Do you see anything that I've missed?\n\n0:05:46\tSPEAKER_02\n No, I think that's all right.\n\n0:05:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:05:49\tSPEAKER_01\n So that would make our total of 11.9, which is...\n\n0:05:54\tSPEAKER_01\n And less than 12.5, which means we'd be making more of a profit.\n\n0:05:59\tSPEAKER_01\n And if we saw a lot of squishy things...\n\n0:06:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Ooh, yeah.\n\n0:06:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:06:08\tNone\n So...\n\n0:06:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Hmm.\n\n0:06:20\tSPEAKER_01\n What did you work on?\n\n0:06:30\tSPEAKER_02\n I've got some evaluation criteria.\n\n0:06:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:06:34\tSPEAKER_02\n I've got the presentation.\n\n0:06:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Silence.\n\n0:06:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:06:40\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:06:49\tSPEAKER_02\n What happens is we have to decide whether this whole project we've been working on, and actually meet the standards we were set at the start.\n\n0:07:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:07:07\tSPEAKER_02\n The method is...\n\n0:07:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I've analyzed the user requirements and integrated them to the TransFunding Marketing reports and in our company's strategy marketing.\n\n0:07:25\tSPEAKER_02\n And the findings were that we needed to look in a certain way, feel in a certain way.\n\n0:07:32\tSPEAKER_02\n And this is everything's listed down.\n\n0:07:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Looking in a certain way, feel in a certain way.\n\n0:07:38\tSPEAKER_02\n It has to be technologically and overtive.\n\n0:07:41\tSPEAKER_02\n And it has to be easy to use.\n\n0:07:43\tSPEAKER_02\n These are all things we looked at at the start.\n\n0:07:46\tSPEAKER_02\n And criteria that have to be met.\n\n0:07:48\tSPEAKER_02\n We have to use a table.\n\n0:07:50\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll show you that later together to decide whether it meets the standards.\n\n0:07:54\tSPEAKER_02\n And we have therefore in total, we have five...\n\n0:08:03\tSPEAKER_02\n We have 11 points according to which this should be evaluated.\n\n0:08:09\tSPEAKER_02\n And the quite...\n\n0:08:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria.\n\n0:08:15\tSPEAKER_02\n I would like to show you the table we have to use.\n\n0:08:19\tSPEAKER_02\n No? This is the table.\n\n0:08:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Can you see this here?\n\n0:08:28\tSPEAKER_02\n So the questions I've given you...\n\n0:08:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Could you write that down?\n\n0:08:32\tSPEAKER_02\n True is one and four is seven.\n\n0:08:38\tSPEAKER_02\n And we'll just go through each point together.\n\n0:08:46\tSPEAKER_02\n I think if each of us gives an opinion, then they can be mixed somehow.\n\n0:08:50\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know how it works, exactly.\n\n0:08:52\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:52\tSPEAKER_00\n I've been told...\n\n0:08:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own?\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it's in the...\n\n0:08:59\tSPEAKER_02\n It's in the project documents.\n\n0:09:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Is it meeting three minutes now?\n\n0:09:03\tSPEAKER_02\n It's called evaluation criteria.\n\n0:09:07\tSPEAKER_02\n And it's...\n\n0:09:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Under evaluation.\n\n0:09:12\tSPEAKER_01\n The PowerPoint one.\n\n0:09:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, okay, cool.\n\n0:09:16\tSPEAKER_02\n We found that open.\n\n0:09:24\tSPEAKER_02\n So it was...\n\n0:09:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, choose one.\n\n0:09:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Choose one and four is seven.\n\n0:09:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you want us to discuss this together?\n\n0:09:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you want us to do it, sing?\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_01\n We can do it separately and then discuss it.\n\n0:09:42\tSPEAKER_01\n If that's what people want to do.\n\n0:09:50\tSPEAKER_02\n So it's actually a scale.\n\n0:09:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Wait, one is true and...\n\n0:09:56\tSPEAKER_01\n So these are the questions we're answering.\n\n0:09:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:09:59\tSPEAKER_02\n And one is...\n\n0:10:00\tSPEAKER_02\n If it's fancy, you put one.\n\n0:10:01\tSPEAKER_01\n One, right.\n\n0:10:02\tSPEAKER_02\n If it's really unfancy, it's...\n\n0:10:04\tSPEAKER_01\n If it's somewhere in between, you put four.\n\n0:10:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, something.\n\n0:10:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Does it feel fancy?\n\n0:11:02\tSPEAKER_02\n It feels like a video.\n\n0:11:09\tNone\n No.\n\n0:11:18\tSPEAKER_02\n There should already be questions.\n\n0:11:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Should be more.\n\n0:11:35\tNone\n The black two is easy to insert.\n\n0:11:53\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm going to say yes.\n\n0:11:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:11:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Very, very true.\n\n0:11:59\tSPEAKER_02\n I imagine there's somewhere on the front.\n\n0:12:01\tSPEAKER_02\n There's a little case that you still don't know.\n\n0:12:31\tNone\n I'm going to say yes.\n\n0:12:38\tNone\n I'm going to say yes.\n\n0:12:45\tNone\n I'm going to say yes.\n\n0:12:52\tNone\n I'm going to say yes.\n\n0:13:05\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm going to say yes.\n\n0:13:14\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't think so.\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Unless you feel you need it.\n\n0:13:33\tSPEAKER_02\n So, 1.1, we're just going to circle.\n\n0:13:47\tSPEAKER_02\n 2.\n\n0:14:05\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.5 to 13.\n\n0:14:26\tSPEAKER_02\n So, 1 was 2 and 7 was false.\n\n0:14:36\tSPEAKER_01\n So, we do have about the same thing.\n\n0:14:44\tSPEAKER_02\n I was thinking 1 means no points.\n\n0:15:14\tSPEAKER_02\n OK.\n\n0:15:28\tSPEAKER_02\n So, starting again, 1.1.\n\n0:15:31\tSPEAKER_02\n So, 1.2.\n\n0:15:46\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:16:04\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.4.\n\n0:16:25\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.2.\n\n0:16:44\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:17:05\tSPEAKER_02\n 2.4.3.\n\n0:17:15\tSPEAKER_02\n OK.\n\n0:17:23\tSPEAKER_01\n So, 1.3.\n\n0:17:44\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:18:02\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:18:23\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:18:41\tSPEAKER_01\n 1.3.\n\n0:19:02\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:19:20\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:19:41\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:19:59\tSPEAKER_01\n 1.3.\n\n0:20:20\tSPEAKER_01\n 1.3.\n\n0:20:38\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:20:59\tSPEAKER_01\n 1.3.\n\n0:21:17\tSPEAKER_01\n 1.3.\n\n0:21:38\tSPEAKER_01\n 1.3.\n\n0:21:56\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:22:17\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:22:35\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:22:56\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:23:14\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:23:35\tSPEAKER_01\n 1.3.\n\n0:23:53\tSPEAKER_01\n 1.3.\n\n0:24:14\tSPEAKER_01\n 1.3.\n\n0:24:32\tSPEAKER_01\n 1.3.\n\n0:24:53\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:25:11\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:25:32\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:25:50\tSPEAKER_01\n 1.3.\n\n0:26:11\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:26:29\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:26:50\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:27:08\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:27:29\tSPEAKER_01\n 1.3.\n\n0:27:47\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:28:08\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:28:26\tSPEAKER_01\n 1.3.\n\n0:28:47\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:29:05\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:29:26\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:29:44\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:30:05\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:30:23\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:30:44\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:31:02\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:31:23\tSPEAKER_01\n 1.3.\n\n0:31:41\tSPEAKER_01\n 1.3.\n\n0:32:02\tSPEAKER_01\n 1.3.\n\n0:32:20\tSPEAKER_02\n 1.3.\n\n0:32:41\tSPEAKER_01\n 1.3.\n\n0:32:59\tNone\n 1.3.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "Bock is coming to the detailed design meeting at 2019 o'clock.
