Okay.\n\n0:08:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Um, well, this is what I would call our luxury model.\n\n0:08:40\tSPEAKER_05\n Um, and if you would, if you look at the, uh, what we could do to make it more, um, to make it just between the 12 year or 50, um, then I did the following changes.\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_05\n 12 year or 40 cents.\n\n0:09:00\tSPEAKER_05\n I came up with by leaving out solar cells, um, by not using the voice recognition feature because it's, uh, it's a four year old, uh, addition to the price.\n\n0:09:15\tSPEAKER_05\n Um, yeah, I believe.\n\n0:09:19\tSPEAKER_05\n Uh, push button.\n\n0:09:23\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, it makes it 13.\n\n0:09:27\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:28\tSPEAKER_05\n Push buttons are, buttons are, are not the most expensive, but do add extra cost.\n\n0:09:35\tSPEAKER_05\n So, um, yeah, this design is not, um, within our price model.\n\n0:09:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:09:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Um, but I'm afraid it's not complete because we use push, um, the, the, the, the, the, the special, special materials, the last item, you have not added one item there.\n\n0:09:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:57\tSPEAKER_03\n So it's way too expensive.\n\n0:10:02\tSPEAKER_05\n It's still too expensive.\n\n0:10:03\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Um, there's only for the buttons.\n\n0:10:06\tSPEAKER_05\n I guess if we leave the, if we leave this one out, um, oh.\n\n0:10:14\tSPEAKER_05\n And, uh, maybe not use a special form.\n\n0:10:17\tSPEAKER_01\n And just press button instead of rubber.\n\n0:10:21\tSPEAKER_05\n It becomes a very dull remote control.\n\n0:10:24\tSPEAKER_05\n I know, but it's the board decision.\n\n0:10:29\tSPEAKER_05\n Um, and, um, yeah.\n\n0:10:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, basically, when, when this is our only option, we should even consider changing the casing because I think there's very little added value in, yeah, uh, an enhanced case with these dull functions.\n\n0:10:49\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:50\tSPEAKER_05\n I know.\n\n0:10:51\tSPEAKER_05\n Maybe we should look at a focus on another, uh, type of, yeah, maybe not, not all that fancy, but just way, way more easy, uh, uh, uh, basic.\n\n0:11:02\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:11:03\tSPEAKER_05\n And, uh, maximize the profits and, um, this maybe that's better.\n\n0:11:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe we should go for a straight and simple.\n\n0:11:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:13\tSPEAKER_03\n But that's not what, uh, has been asked.\n\n0:11:15\tSPEAKER_05\n I know, I know.\n\n0:11:17\tSPEAKER_03\n So we should kick the boards, uh, well, yeah.\n\n0:11:23\tSPEAKER_05\n Although I think we could still make a remote control that, uh, um, applies, uh, more to young people, uh, by giving it another color already.\n\n0:11:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Mm-hmm.\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_05\n Um, so it is possible to make a device that attracts a little bit more to young people.\n\n0:11:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:11:44\tSPEAKER_05\n Um, but, uh, I agree it's not a fancy high-tech, uh, device.\n\n0:11:49\tSPEAKER_05\n Definitely not.\n\n0:11:51\tNone\n No.\n\n0:11:52\tSPEAKER_05\n It's not that innovative.\n\n0:11:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Mm-hmm.\n\n0:11:56\tSPEAKER_05\n Or however you pronounce that.\n\n0:11:59\tSPEAKER_05\n Um, so, okay.\n\n0:12:02\tSPEAKER_05\n Um, oh, this is the wrong one.\n\n0:12:09\tSPEAKER_05\n So, uh, that means redesign.\n\n0:12:19\tSPEAKER_05\n We do not have the time, uh, uh, now to, to redesign the products.\n\n0:12:23\tSPEAKER_05\n Mm-hmm.\n\n0:12:24\tSPEAKER_05\n Um, but we can evaluate the process and, um, uh, the satisfaction on how things went.\n\n0:12:35\tSPEAKER_05\n Um, I'm not sure if we need to evaluate, uh, the device first, I guess.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_04\n Um, well, since we're not going to manufacture it anyway.\n\n0:12:46\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:47\tSPEAKER_05\n Mm-hmm.\n\n0:12:48\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n0:12:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, maybe it's good to do it anyway, because if we, we can learn, we, we can also determine if our objectives are good.\n\n0:12:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:59\tSPEAKER_05\n So, I agree.\n\n0:13:01\tSPEAKER_05\n Well.\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:06\tSPEAKER_05\n Is it fancy?\n\n0:13:10\tNone\n It is.\n\n0:13:13\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Is it, is it fancy?\n\n0:13:18\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n0:13:22\tSPEAKER_04\n I think so.\n\n0:13:23\tSPEAKER_01\n You like the rubber at all.\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_05\n I'm into it.\n\n0:13:25\tSPEAKER_03\n So, uh, one, yeah, it's not that fancy.\n\n0:13:34\tSPEAKER_05\n No, I'll give it a two.\n\n0:13:36\tSPEAKER_03\n I think, I think it would have been more fancy if we used titanium housing, the casing.\n\n0:13:43\tSPEAKER_03\n It would be like that.\n\n0:13:44\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm into it.\n\n0:13:45\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm into it.\n\n0:13:47\tSPEAKER_03\n That's the flavor as well.\n\n0:13:51\tSPEAKER_03\n It has flavor.\n\n0:13:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, that's right.\n\n0:13:53\tSPEAKER_03\n That's right, you should taste it.\n\n0:13:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Right.\n\n0:13:56\tSPEAKER_05\n Is it, I know, but, but, but that's fancy in the way.\n\n0:14:05\tSPEAKER_05\n I mean, fancy has, has a lot of, it has to do with fashion, I guess.\n\n0:14:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:11\tSPEAKER_04\n So, do, trendy, trendy, yeah, what they want, wanted was, uh, colors and soft materials.\n\n0:14:18\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:19\tSPEAKER_05\n So, in that way, it applies.\n\n0:14:21\tSPEAKER_05\n It, yeah.\n\n0:14:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, just give it a two.\n\n0:14:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:25\tSPEAKER_03\n I think, I think, I think, I would have been, I would have think, it could have been more fancy by using the double curved case.\n\n0:14:33\tSPEAKER_03\n It would have been even more fancy, but we decided not to, because if we used double, yeah, but that's the case.\n\n0:14:39\tSPEAKER_03\n We couldn't use solar.\n\n0:14:41\tSPEAKER_01\n So, looking at the user, uh, needs, we only, uh, don't, we don't have the double curved case.\n\n0:14:50\tSPEAKER_01\n We, we do have the rubber, we do have the colors.\n\n0:14:54\tSPEAKER_01\n There's two out of three.\n\n0:14:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:14:57\tSPEAKER_03\n So, I believe we're close to two.\n\n0:14:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:00\tSPEAKER_03\n I agree.\n\n0:15:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, I agree, too.\n\n0:15:02\tSPEAKER_03\n It's okay.\n\n0:15:03\tSPEAKER_03\n We do the, we, yes, we did good.\n\n0:15:04\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:15:05\tSPEAKER_04\n And, uh, what's it?\n\n0:15:06\tSPEAKER_04\n Inventive.\n\n0:15:07\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, with the voice recognition feature and, uh, it's not in it.\n\n0:15:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Or, can we, no, we are evaluating this, this design.\n\n0:15:19\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Dispray time.\n\n0:15:22\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it is.\n\n0:15:23\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it's innovative.\n\n0:15:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:25\tSPEAKER_03\n And the scroll, uh, wheel, the solar, not many remotes.\n\n0:15:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Have the solar, I think.\n\n0:15:30\tSPEAKER_03\n You know, it could have been a little bit more innovative, by using the kinetic energy source.\n\n0:15:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:37\tSPEAKER_05\n And, uh, it's, uh, it's, uh, it's a little bit of a thrill.\n\n0:15:39\tSPEAKER_04\n Yes.\n\n0:15:40\tSPEAKER_04\n But, so, uh, also, I think, uh, it's a two.\n\n0:15:44\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:45\tSPEAKER_04\n Is it easy to use?\n\n0:15:49\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:50\tSPEAKER_05\n I'm not sure.\n\n0:15:52\tSPEAKER_05\n I'm not sure.\n\n0:15:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, yeah, the voice recognition, of course, is hard to learn, I think.\n\n0:16:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, hard.\n\n0:16:03\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not for the, for the, for the elderly.\n\n0:16:08\tSPEAKER_03\n They won't use it.\n\n0:16:09\tSPEAKER_03\n There are two parts in this remote control.\n\n0:16:11\tSPEAKER_03\n What you see here is, is the basic part.\n\n0:16:14\tSPEAKER_03\n It can use it.\n\n0:16:15\tSPEAKER_03\n So, that's easy to use.\n\n0:16:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:17\tSPEAKER_03\n That's for a novice user.\n\n0:16:19\tSPEAKER_03\n When you have a more advanced leverage user, well, such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions.\n\n0:16:28\tSPEAKER_03\n So in that, in that way, it is advanced.\n\n0:16:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:33\tSPEAKER_03\n And I think it's easy to use for, for both, uh, types of users.\n\n0:16:39\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it's maybe, it's not very, uh,\n\n0:16:44\tSPEAKER_01\n easy free. I think it's easy free.\n\n0:16:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Wouldn't give it more.\n\n0:16:49\tSPEAKER_05\n I'm doubting, doubting as well.\n\n0:16:52\tSPEAKER_04\n Um, the, the most important function is easy to use.\n\n0:16:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:57\tSPEAKER_04\n The, the zapping, channel switching, volume.\n\n0:17:00\tSPEAKER_04\n But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder.\n\n0:17:06\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:17:07\tSPEAKER_05\n Uh, two or three, three, what, what would be your guess?\n\n0:17:13\tSPEAKER_05\n I mean, ease of use, um, does not only apply to the most basic functions.\n\n0:17:18\tSPEAKER_05\n It's the, it's overall, it's the device easy to use.\n\n0:17:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n0:17:23\tSPEAKER_03\n You're right in that.\n\n0:17:24\tSPEAKER_03\n But I guess, I guess an advanced user will, will find the voice recognition function easy to use.\n\n0:17:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Because he is already, he or she is already an advanced user.\n\n0:17:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:35\tSPEAKER_03\n So, um, I think personally, I would give it to, but.\n\n0:17:40\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:17:41\tSPEAKER_05\n Uh, it all is three.\n\n0:17:42\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:43\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:17:44\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:17:45\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:17:46\tSPEAKER_04\n Two, two, three, two, three.\n\n0:17:50\tSPEAKER_03\n So that's, so I could make it, if you make it four, so that will be three in general.\n\n0:18:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Now two and a half.\n\n0:18:05\tSPEAKER_03\n If you make four, six and four is ten divided by four is two and a half.\n\n0:18:13\tSPEAKER_03\n So, darn.\n\n0:18:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Nah.\n\n0:18:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:18:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Rule.\n\n0:18:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Three.\n\n0:18:18\tSPEAKER_03\n No.\n\n0:18:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Four and a three together.\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Four.\n\n0:18:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:23\tSPEAKER_03\n You have a two.\n\n0:18:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Two, two, three.\n\n0:18:25\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:18:26\tSPEAKER_01\n I haven't said anything yet.\n\n0:18:27\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:18:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:18:29\tSPEAKER_05\n But if I would say a three, then it's six and four is ten divided by four.\n\n0:18:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Divided by four is two point five.\n\n0:18:38\tSPEAKER_01\n So if you want to have the conclusion as a three, three, then you would make a four.\n\n0:18:45\tSPEAKER_05\n If you fill out a four, but I'm filling in a three, so it will be a two point five.\n\n0:18:51\tSPEAKER_03\n But that's not possible to fill in.\n\n0:18:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, yes.\n\n0:18:53\tSPEAKER_05\n I have a video.\n\n0:18:56\tSPEAKER_05\n Exactly.\n\n0:18:57\tSPEAKER_05\n It's not about the content.\n\n0:19:01\tSPEAKER_05\n It's about.\n\n0:19:02\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:19:03\tSPEAKER_05\n Is it easy to find?\n\n0:19:06\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, definitely.\n\n0:19:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:19:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, we haven't really worked it out, but it's much better than you can just say.\n\n0:19:13\tSPEAKER_01\n You can just say find and he repeats, find our beeps or.\n\n0:19:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but that's the basic idea of the speaker.\n\n0:19:21\tSPEAKER_01\n I think I'm here.\n\n0:19:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Something like that.\n\n0:19:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe you have to program it once to let respond to a certain word or something like where are you?\n\n0:19:32\tSPEAKER_03\n And then it will sing, I'm here.\n\n0:19:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Something like that.\n\n0:19:37\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, we should not stay too long on this subject because of the time, but I personally give it a one.\n\n0:19:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Sebastian?\n\n0:19:44\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, me too.\n\n0:19:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Me too.\n\n0:19:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, right.\n\n0:19:47\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, the field of remote control is spongy.\n\n0:19:52\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, it can't be more spongy.\n\n0:19:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, it can be.\n\n0:19:56\tSPEAKER_03\n There are cases in which the outside casing is.\n\n0:20:02\tSPEAKER_03\n It can be out.\n\n0:20:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Is that one of our models?\n\n0:20:06\tSPEAKER_03\n No, it's not one of our options.\n\n0:20:08\tSPEAKER_05\n Now, okay, this one you're looking at, spongy or the option given, it's the most spongy one.\n\n0:20:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, but that's not what they're talking about, I think, because we compare all these characteristics with market with the real market.\n\n0:20:23\tSPEAKER_03\n So there are remote controls out there, which are a lot of spongy.\n\n0:20:28\tSPEAKER_03\n They're out there.\n\n0:20:32\tSPEAKER_03\n In this case, we've done the best we could.\n\n0:20:34\tSPEAKER_03\n But it's not good enough, so it's a two.\n\n0:20:36\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll give it a one.\n\n0:20:37\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll take one.\n\n0:20:38\tSPEAKER_03\n You take one?\n\n0:20:40\tSPEAKER_03\n What do you give it?\n\n0:20:43\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, yeah, it depends, because it's the most spongy we can give it.\n\n0:20:46\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, I know, but you have to name it, because we need to go on in for the time.\n\n0:20:55\tSPEAKER_04\n If I give it one, it will be one health calculation.\n\n0:21:00\tSPEAKER_04\n So I'll just give it a two and make this a 1.5.\n\n0:21:03\tSPEAKER_03\n No, no, no.\n\n0:21:04\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll change it.\n\n0:21:06\tSPEAKER_03\n My mark will be a four.\n\n0:21:09\tSPEAKER_05\n You are.\n\n0:21:13\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:21:14\tSPEAKER_05\n The remote control offers enough features.\n\n0:21:17\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, what do you think about it?\n\n0:21:21\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, the basic layout doesn't offer much, but the voice recognition could add a lot.\n\n0:21:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Basically, it's completely programmable.\n\n0:21:31\tSPEAKER_03\n You can add very much functionality by using the voice recognition mode.\n\n0:21:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I know.\n\n0:21:38\tSPEAKER_03\n It's quite intense.\n\n0:21:39\tSPEAKER_03\n What we didn't talk about is that it doesn't have the digits.\n\n0:21:43\tSPEAKER_01\n I believe it's.\n\n0:21:45\tSPEAKER_01\n If you ask yourself, it offers enough features.\n\n0:21:52\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't think it has all the features or a normal remote has.\n\n0:21:57\tSPEAKER_05\n I think it has.\n\n0:21:58\tSPEAKER_04\n It depends on what you implement in this.\n\n0:22:01\tSPEAKER_05\n Because you can, we didn't talk about it, but you do have remote controls that are able to adapt another signal.\n\n0:22:08\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:22:09\tSPEAKER_05\n You place a regular remote control in front of the other one, hit the one, or the two, or the three, whatever.\n\n0:22:17\tSPEAKER_05\n And it records the series.\n\n0:22:22\tSPEAKER_05\n The signal.\n\n0:22:23\tSPEAKER_05\n The signal.\n\n0:22:24\tSPEAKER_05\n So you could enter any comment you like as long as it's able to reproduce the infrared signal.\n\n0:22:36\tSPEAKER_05\n So I think this is a remote control with a very high level of features.\n\n0:22:42\tSPEAKER_05\n Absolutely.\n\n0:22:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Although there are a few buttons, but the inside is quite advanced.\n\n0:22:48\tSPEAKER_03\n That's it power, I guess, because a regular programmable remote control contains a lot of buttons.\n\n0:22:54\tSPEAKER_03\n At least 40 buttons.\n\n0:22:56\tSPEAKER_03\n So it's quite complicated to get used to.\n\n0:23:01\tSPEAKER_03\n And this is quite simple.\n\n0:23:06\tSPEAKER_03\n You can use your voice to program it.\n\n0:23:08\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:23:09\tSPEAKER_05\n Let's give it a number.\n\n0:23:10\tSPEAKER_05\n I'll give it a one.\n\n0:23:12\tSPEAKER_05\n For this type of market, I think it's a one.\n\n0:23:16\tSPEAKER_01\n I'll give it a two.\n\n0:23:19\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll give it a one.\n\n0:23:22\tSPEAKER_04\n I think a one.\n\n0:23:23\tSPEAKER_04\n Because with the voice recognition, you could add anything you want.\n\n0:23:28\tSPEAKER_04\n That's fine.\n\n0:23:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:23:32\tSPEAKER_03\n I think we've succeeded in developing a product that's actually quite good, but not for this kind of market, and not for this kind of price.\n\n0:23:42\tSPEAKER_05\n So high quality, low acceptance.\n\n0:23:47\tSPEAKER_05\n The product has a high quality and is advanced.\n\n0:23:54\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:23:55\tSPEAKER_05\n But whether or not our clients are willing to pay 25 euros for this kind of device, is that, well, it's not sure.\n\n0:24:09\tSPEAKER_05\n Do you agree?\n\n0:24:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, I agree.\n\n0:24:11\tSPEAKER_04\n Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced.\n\n0:24:16\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:17\tSPEAKER_05\n Maybe we should have a radar function.\n\n0:24:22\tSPEAKER_01\n But it wasn't selling price 50.\n\n0:24:25\tSPEAKER_01\n 25 years.\n\n0:24:26\tSPEAKER_01\n 25.\n\n0:24:27\tSPEAKER_01\n And costs were 1250.\n\n0:24:29\tSPEAKER_01\n But even now, if only our production costs were exceeded the double, I think, production costs were 22.\n\n0:24:41\tSPEAKER_01\n So selling price would be about 50 euros.\n\n0:24:46\tSPEAKER_03\n That's quite expensive.\n\n0:24:47\tSPEAKER_03\n That's why.\n\n0:24:48\tSPEAKER_03\n It's not very expensive for remote control that has this kind of...\n\n0:24:52\tSPEAKER_03\n No, it's not remote control of any TV kind.\n\n0:24:54\tSPEAKER_03\n A Philips remote control, you pay more than 50 euros.\n\n0:24:58\tSPEAKER_03\n It's quite expensive.\n\n0:24:59\tSPEAKER_03\n I know from a few years ago, it costs a hundred dealers.\n\n0:25:03\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, I know, but you're paying for the brand because there are remote controls which control your stereo, television, DVD, CD player for under 25 euros.\n\n0:25:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:25:15\tSPEAKER_03\n And you can learn this thing, all these functions.\n\n0:25:18\tSPEAKER_03\n And it's easier to use because those remote controls don't offer voice recognition.\n\n0:25:23\tSPEAKER_03\n And this one does.\n\n0:25:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:25\tSPEAKER_03\n So I think it's worth its price.\n\n0:25:27\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:25:29\tSPEAKER_05\n You had an overall rating.\n\n0:25:32\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, but...\n\n0:25:34\tSPEAKER_04\n That's counting.\n\n0:25:35\tSPEAKER_03\n These ratings?\n\n0:25:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, it's about...\n\n0:25:38\tSPEAKER_03\n It should be about 1.5.\n\n0:25:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Something like that.\n\n0:25:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:25:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:25:45\tSPEAKER_05\n We'll go further on with the rest of the evaluation.\n\n0:25:55\tSPEAKER_05\n About the project itself, not about the product.\n\n0:26:00\tSPEAKER_05\n What did you think about the process, the project process?\n\n0:26:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Rude.\n\n0:26:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Rude.\n\n0:26:18\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Well...\n\n0:26:22\tSPEAKER_05\n I tried to translate that.\n\n0:26:26\tSPEAKER_04\n Hmm.\n\n0:26:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Any other...\n\n0:26:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, I think...\n\n0:26:32\tSPEAKER_05\n Rude.\n\n0:26:33\tSPEAKER_05\n The process was good.\n\n0:26:36\tSPEAKER_01\n But we weren't aware of the prices of the cost.\n\n0:26:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:43\tSPEAKER_01\n And that was the big deal.\n\n0:26:45\tSPEAKER_01\n If we knew that before, we could have made the choice between us.\n\n0:26:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Better decisions.\n\n0:26:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:51\tSPEAKER_03\n We had two little information, actually.\n\n0:26:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:54\tSPEAKER_03\n So...\n\n0:26:55\tSPEAKER_03\n And the...\n\n0:26:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, looking at room for creativity, there was...\n\n0:27:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Way too...\n\n0:27:01\tSPEAKER_03\n The choice of components was way too narrow.\n\n0:27:04\tSPEAKER_03\n So...\n\n0:27:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:07\tSPEAKER_05\n That was not really a process of...\n\n0:27:09\tSPEAKER_05\n So we could be...\n\n0:27:10\tSPEAKER_05\n We could have been creative, but...\n\n0:27:13\tSPEAKER_05\n It was tempered by the choice of components and...\n\n0:27:16\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes, the price.\n\n0:27:17\tSPEAKER_03\n The price.\n\n0:27:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, in the first meeting, we already were very creative.\n\n0:27:21\tSPEAKER_03\n We thought of possibilities who are not possible with the current...\n\n0:27:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Offer of manufacturing components.\n\n0:27:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:32\tSPEAKER_03\n We're tempered by that, yes.\n\n0:27:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, rule.\n\n0:27:35\tSPEAKER_05\n Any other thoughts on that?\n\n0:27:38\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:27:39\tSPEAKER_05\n No.\n\n0:27:40\tNone\n Rude.\n\n0:27:41\tSPEAKER_05\n I agree.\n\n0:27:42\tSPEAKER_05\n You agree.\n\n0:27:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:27:44\tSPEAKER_05\n Leadership.\n\n0:27:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Fantastic.\n\n0:27:47\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, rules on the forest promotion.\n\n0:27:50\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, it is okay.\n\n0:27:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:27:58\tSPEAKER_03\n I think we're a good team.\n\n0:28:01\tSPEAKER_05\n I think so too.\n\n0:28:02\tSPEAKER_05\n It's...\n\n0:28:03\tSPEAKER_05\n Of course, a laboratory environment.\n\n0:28:06\tSPEAKER_05\n I missed it to be able to contact you in between.\n\n0:28:10\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:28:11\tSPEAKER_05\n And say, Aero, can I make a joke?\n\n0:28:15\tSPEAKER_05\n I tried once, but that was not a lot.\n\n0:28:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:20\tSPEAKER_05\n So...\n\n0:28:22\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, but...\n\n0:28:24\tSPEAKER_05\n When taking into account the situation, I think we performed pretty well.\n\n0:28:30\tSPEAKER_05\n I think so too.\n\n0:28:31\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:32\tSPEAKER_05\n The means, the smart board, the digital pen, did you like them?\n\n0:28:36\tSPEAKER_03\n The digital pen was okay, but the smart board was really bad.\n\n0:28:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Because of the response or...\n\n0:28:41\tSPEAKER_03\n The response is...\n\n0:28:42\tSPEAKER_03\n The response is very slow.\n\n0:28:43\tSPEAKER_03\n And the possibilities are very limited.\n\n0:28:45\tSPEAKER_03\n It's not accurate.\n\n0:28:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:28:48\tSPEAKER_01\n It has...\n\n0:28:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:50\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not accurate.\n\n0:28:51\tSPEAKER_01\n The pointing of the pen is not...\n\n0:28:55\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a place where it... where it...\n\n0:29:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Trolls?\n\n0:29:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, where it draws.\n\n0:29:02\tSPEAKER_03\n It's the drawing on the board is right from the pen.\n\n0:29:07\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, so it had to be...\n\n0:29:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Better line for what's the word?\n\n0:29:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:14\tSPEAKER_05\n Maybe it needs to be calibrated.\n\n0:29:16\tSPEAKER_05\n It was calibrated just before this meeting.\n\n0:29:18\tSPEAKER_05\n The one before the third meeting.\n\n0:29:20\tSPEAKER_05\n So it's not the calibration.\n\n0:29:22\tSPEAKER_05\n It's the thing itself.\n\n0:29:23\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:29:25\tSPEAKER_05\n Did you use the pen a lot?\n\n0:29:27\tSPEAKER_05\n Not at all.\n\n0:29:28\tSPEAKER_05\n Not at all.\n\n0:29:29\tSPEAKER_05\n Not really.\n\n0:29:30\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:29:31\tSPEAKER_05\n I thought it was quite a handy thing.\n\n0:29:34\tSPEAKER_05\n Although I would like to see OCR.\n\n0:29:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:29:40\tSPEAKER_01\n If it has OCR, I think I would use...\n\n0:29:44\tSPEAKER_01\n I just took notes for myself.\n\n0:29:47\tSPEAKER_01\n And that's it.\n\n0:29:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:50\tSPEAKER_01\n It was necessary for me to...\n\n0:29:52\tSPEAKER_05\n To digitize them.\n\n0:29:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Because if I want something on the computer, I just type it.\n\n0:29:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:58\tSPEAKER_01\n I type faster than that.\n\n0:29:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:30:00\tSPEAKER_03\n But I think it's a great solution for a...\n\n0:30:03\tSPEAKER_03\n A known problem.\n\n0:30:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Writing down some notes, some information.\n\n0:30:08\tSPEAKER_03\n And then forgetting your notebook somewhere.\n\n0:30:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:12\tSPEAKER_03\n And losing all that information.\n\n0:30:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Because you have everything in one place.\n\n0:30:16\tSPEAKER_03\n And it's quite easy.\n\n0:30:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Quite easy.\n\n0:30:19\tSPEAKER_03\n It's possible to make this information digital and share it with others.\n\n0:30:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Quite easy way.\n\n0:30:25\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it's a good product.\n\n0:30:27\tSPEAKER_03\n I only think the shape of the pen is too big.\n\n0:30:32\tSPEAKER_03\n It's not quite ergonomics.\n\n0:30:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Ergonomics.\n\n0:30:36\tSPEAKER_03\n I know.\n\n0:30:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:30:39\tSPEAKER_05\n What did you think about the Smartboard?\n\n0:30:48\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, I only used it to draw a rabbit.\n\n0:30:51\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:52\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:30:53\tSPEAKER_05\n You can't really decide.\n\n0:30:54\tSPEAKER_05\n I missed a feature to easily select a slide and distribute it to the laptops.\n\n0:31:02\tSPEAKER_05\n I think that would be very easy if you could say, okay, I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on the...\n\n0:31:09\tSPEAKER_04\n Or the other way around.\n\n0:31:11\tSPEAKER_05\n Or the other way around that you could show.\n\n0:31:14\tSPEAKER_05\n But that's quite what PowerPoint does.\n\n0:31:16\tSPEAKER_01\n If you save this image, you can open it in your shared work folder.\n\n0:31:21\tSPEAKER_01\n I know.\n\n0:31:22\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's almost...\n\n0:31:23\tSPEAKER_05\n I know, but we couldn't choose that feature.\n\n0:31:25\tSPEAKER_05\n So I missed it.\n\n0:31:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:27\tSPEAKER_05\n We weren't able to do that.\n\n0:31:29\tSPEAKER_05\n At least I wasn't explained how to do such.\n\n0:31:34\tSPEAKER_01\n And the function of a filling and an oval or an object.\n\n0:31:40\tSPEAKER_03\n The drawing...\n\n0:31:41\tSPEAKER_03\n It's not possible that these are very limited.\n\n0:31:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:31:45\tSPEAKER_03\n So when you're using windows, you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons, which you can use for drawing.\n\n0:31:55\tSPEAKER_03\n And a lot of these buttons don't appear here.\n\n0:31:58\tSPEAKER_03\n That looks like...\n\n0:31:59\tSPEAKER_03\n It's not even as advanced as paint.\n\n0:32:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Not way.\n\n0:32:03\tSPEAKER_03\n It's quite limited.\n\n0:32:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:32:08\tNone\n No.\n\n0:32:10\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:11\tSPEAKER_05\n The project is evaluated.\n\n0:32:14\tSPEAKER_05\n But, well, we need to redesign the project.\n\n0:32:19\tSPEAKER_05\n No, very good celebration.\n\n0:32:22\tSPEAKER_03\n A very good celebration.\n\n0:32:24\tSPEAKER_03\n A very good celebration.\n\n0:32:26\tSPEAKER_03\n A very good celebration.\n\n0:32:27\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a privilege for working with you.\n\n0:32:32\tSPEAKER_05\n You're dismissed.\n\n0:32:35\tSPEAKER_05\n I think we are ready.\n\n0:32:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:32:40\tSPEAKER_03\n To private rooms.\n\n0:32:43\tSPEAKER_03\n I see some action over there.\n\n0:32:45\tSPEAKER_05\n Private room at all.\n\n0:32:47\tSPEAKER_05\n That sounds quite scary.\n\n0:32:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:32:53\tSPEAKER_05\n Now let's find out the way to...\n\n0:32:56\tSPEAKER_02\n They don't understand you for best.\n\n0:33:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Never.\n\n0:33:01\tSPEAKER_03\n That was when we were done.\n\n0:33:03\tSPEAKER_03\n We're finished.\n\n0:33:04\tSPEAKER_03\n So, are there any more cycles in this process?\n\n0:33:08\tSPEAKER_03\n I think not.\n\n0:33:09\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't believe so.\n\n0:33:10\tSPEAKER_05\n Or maybe
