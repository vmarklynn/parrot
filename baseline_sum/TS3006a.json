Yes.\n\n0:01:06\tNone\n Blame, blame.\n\n0:01:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:01:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:01:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:01:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Where's my screen gone?\n\n0:01:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh.\n\n0:01:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Who did?\n\n0:01:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh yeah.\n\n0:01:34\tSPEAKER_03\n You have to talk in English.\n\n0:01:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:01:38\tSPEAKER_01\n My screen is gone.\n\n0:01:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, it's called black.\n\n0:01:43\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm afraid I'm a bit slow for this stuff.\n\n0:01:50\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:01:51\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm afraid I'm a bit too slow.\n\n0:01:53\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know how much preparation you guys did, but not a lot.\n\n0:01:58\tSPEAKER_02\n You see this beautiful presentation.\n\n0:02:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:02:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Very nice.\n\n0:02:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's get started.\n\n0:02:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:02:05\tSPEAKER_02\n I sort of prepared this.\n\n0:02:09\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm opening acquaintance tool training, how to use the things here.\n\n0:02:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Project plan discussion and the rest of the meeting.\n\n0:02:22\tSPEAKER_02\n We're supposed to develop a new remote control that's both original, trendy and user-friendly.\n\n0:02:29\tSPEAKER_02\n So I hope you have good ideas.\n\n0:02:33\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know.\n\n0:02:35\tSPEAKER_02\n We're working from top to bottom, functional design.\n\n0:02:40\tSPEAKER_02\n And we do some individual work, new and meeting to discuss the results, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n0:02:46\tSPEAKER_02\n And at the end of the day, we should have a prototype thrown up.\n\n0:02:52\tSPEAKER_02\n We have available the Smartboard and the Wideboard.\n\n0:02:59\tSPEAKER_02\n We should take some practice.\n\n0:03:00\tSPEAKER_02\n We have some instructions now to do that.\n\n0:03:05\tSPEAKER_02\n How to document work.\n\n0:03:09\tSPEAKER_02\n This is for toolbar.\n\n0:03:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Next, we have a pen.\n\n0:03:17\tSPEAKER_02\n And we can use this pen to perform expressions.\n\n0:03:24\tSPEAKER_02\n So it doesn't always work.\n\n0:03:31\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:03:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, so you can draw.\n\n0:03:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Draw.\n\n0:03:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Draw.\n\n0:03:38\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:03:39\tSPEAKER_02\n And in the format menu, you can select color and line width, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n0:03:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:03:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Each of you can take some practice and you should draw an animal.\n\n0:03:57\tSPEAKER_02\n And you should explain with different colors and with different pen widths.\n\n0:04:01\tSPEAKER_02\n And you should explain why you draw that particular animal.\n\n0:04:06\tSPEAKER_02\n So you're in.\n\n0:04:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:04:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Don't take up too much space.\n\n0:04:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:04:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Different pen widths.\n\n0:04:15\tSPEAKER_03\n How do you do that?\n\n0:04:16\tSPEAKER_02\n With the format menu.\n\n0:04:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:04:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Use different colors, et cetera.\n\n0:04:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:04:26\tSPEAKER_02\n What's that supposed to be?\n\n0:04:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Should it be one?\n\n0:04:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:04:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, yeah, four left.\n\n0:04:35\tSPEAKER_00\n It's the rough yellow.\n\n0:04:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it needs some yellow.\n\n0:04:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Can you use one blank sheet burr drawing?\n\n0:04:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:04:45\tSPEAKER_01\n So he must save it at the end.\n\n0:04:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, you can press the next button, which is.\n\n0:04:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, in the file option.\n\n0:04:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:04:54\tSPEAKER_02\n In file menu.\n\n0:04:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:04:56\tSPEAKER_01\n No, you can do it.\n\n0:04:57\tSPEAKER_03\n How much time do we have to draw anyway?\n\n0:05:00\tSPEAKER_03\n I can take forever on this.\n\n0:05:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, do I have to explain why it chose this animal?\n\n0:05:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:06\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's a great animal.\n\n0:05:09\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a giraffe.\n\n0:05:11\tSPEAKER_00\n How'd you guess?\n\n0:05:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:05:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it's more like a dinosaur.\n\n0:05:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:05:17\tSPEAKER_00\n I will give it an eye.\n\n0:05:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:05:19\tNone\n That's nice of you.\n\n0:05:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Hey, come on.\n\n0:05:21\tSPEAKER_00\n So leave to eat.\n\n0:05:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:05:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Pretty good.\n\n0:05:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Could you press the next?\n\n0:05:26\tSPEAKER_01\n The next.\n\n0:05:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:05:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:05:29\tSPEAKER_02\n That'll do.\n\n0:05:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Thanks.\n\n0:05:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Is this part of our acquaintance or introduction?\n\n0:05:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, introduction.\n\n0:05:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Get acquainted.\n\n0:05:54\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:05:55\tSPEAKER_02\n That's the idea.\n\n0:05:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Here, lime broke.\n\n0:06:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:07\tSPEAKER_03\n All right.\n\n0:06:08\tSPEAKER_01\n That's fast.\n\n0:06:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:10\tSPEAKER_01\n I see.\n\n0:06:11\tSPEAKER_01\n This is the spot.\n\n0:06:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Keep depression.\n\n0:06:13\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm guessing a turtle.\n\n0:06:17\tSPEAKER_01\n I say good gas.\n\n0:06:19\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm guessing a turtle.\n\n0:06:23\tSPEAKER_01\n I say good gas.\n\n0:06:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Why a turtle?\n\n0:06:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Because of its shell.\n\n0:06:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Because it's slow.\n\n0:06:33\tSPEAKER_01\n It's slow.\n\n0:06:34\tSPEAKER_01\n You were slow too?\n\n0:06:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I was a bit slow too.\n\n0:06:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Dude, you're a good drawer.\n\n0:06:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Some other lime.\n\n0:06:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Do you have a turtle pet?\n\n0:06:51\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:06:56\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:06:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Does it have legs?\n\n0:06:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:06:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it looks exactly legs, but...\n\n0:07:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Stop it, stop.\n\n0:07:03\tSPEAKER_01\n It's more like a tank.\n\n0:07:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that's fins, but I don't know where.\n\n0:07:08\tSPEAKER_03\n They kind of look like mold legs.\n\n0:07:11\tSPEAKER_03\n What's sharp nails?\n\n0:07:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Some spots.\n\n0:07:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Some eye.\n\n0:07:22\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a friendly turtle, I guess.\n\n0:07:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, well, I think it's fair enough.\n\n0:07:32\tSPEAKER_03\n A little tail, maybe?\n\n0:07:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:07:40\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know what position is.\n\n0:07:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Does it have ears?\n\n0:07:47\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:07:48\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:07:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Can you erase ears?\n\n0:07:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:07:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:53\tSPEAKER_01\n A gum.\n\n0:07:54\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:07:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Eraser.\n\n0:07:56\tSPEAKER_03\n And why did you choose this animal?\n\n0:07:59\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:08:01\tSPEAKER_01\n It just came into my mind.\n\n0:08:03\tSPEAKER_01\n There's no particular reason.\n\n0:08:06\tSPEAKER_01\n It's like a pen.\n\n0:08:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, you like it.\n\n0:08:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I'm guessing I'm done.\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:08:19\tSPEAKER_02\n That's my turtle.\n\n0:08:21\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:08:22\tSPEAKER_01\n How to select the next?\n\n0:08:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Here.\n\n0:08:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:26\tSPEAKER_03\n There you go.\n\n0:08:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Colors were under format, all right?\n\n0:08:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Let's see.\n\n0:08:33\tSPEAKER_03\n How am I going to do this?\n\n0:08:54\tSPEAKER_02\n I read it.\n\n0:08:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Gengaroo.\n\n0:08:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Not quite, actually.\n\n0:09:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Fire.\n\n0:09:04\tSPEAKER_03\n No.\n\n0:09:05\tSPEAKER_03\n 8.\n\n0:09:07\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a cat.\n\n0:09:09\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a cat.\n\n0:09:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Not a cat, but an accident.\n\n0:09:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Why a cat?\n\n0:09:16\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:09:17\tSPEAKER_03\n They're my favorite bats.\n\n0:09:19\tSPEAKER_02\n You have some.\n\n0:09:20\tSPEAKER_03\n I have a color already.\n\n0:09:24\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm not so good at drawing with this kind of stuff.\n\n0:09:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, shit.\n\n0:09:28\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm the pet.\n\n0:09:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Excuse my language.\n\n0:09:33\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know how to draw a face, but you get the idea.\n\n0:09:37\tSPEAKER_03\n It's my favorite pet animal.\n\n0:09:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Because they're cute, they're independent, and cuddly.\n\n0:09:43\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:09:46\tSPEAKER_03\n That's it.\n\n0:09:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Or do I need to use more colors?\n\n0:09:50\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's okay.\n\n0:09:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Get ID.\n\n0:09:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:09:57\tSPEAKER_02\n We have a financial aspect to this project.\n\n0:10:02\tSPEAKER_02\n We can sell them at 25 euros.\n\n0:10:06\tSPEAKER_02\n The aim is to reach to sell as much as 50 million euros.\n\n0:10:12\tSPEAKER_02\n That's quite a big amount of money.\n\n0:10:17\tSPEAKER_02\n And the production cost should be the half of the selling price.\n\n0:10:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:10:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Now it's time for some discussion.\n\n0:10:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's take it.\n\n0:10:35\tNone\n Two.\n\n0:10:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:10:41\tSPEAKER_00\n What do you want to discuss?\n\n0:10:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:45\tSPEAKER_02\n We should get started.\n\n0:10:49\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm taking notes.\n\n0:10:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:10:53\tSPEAKER_02\n We each have a specific task, as I saw in my mill.\n\n0:11:00\tSPEAKER_02\n I didn't know if you received the same mill.\n\n0:11:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:04\tSPEAKER_02\n I guess so.\n\n0:11:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:11:06\tSPEAKER_02\n So the industry, industry designer, should produce a working design.\n\n0:11:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Am I correct?\n\n0:11:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Two.\n\n0:11:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:11:17\tSPEAKER_02\n The user interface, these are the shoots, specified a technical functions.\n\n0:11:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Right?\n\n0:11:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:24\tSPEAKER_02\n And the marketing experts should come up with user requirements.\n\n0:11:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Did any of you already do some work on this part?\n\n0:11:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, I started making an overview for myself what I had to do.\n\n0:11:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Because we have three design steps.\n\n0:11:47\tSPEAKER_03\n And in every step I have a specific task to perform or whatever.\n\n0:11:51\tSPEAKER_03\n So I had to, I don't know, make an overview for myself about what I have to do and kind of let it work in to get ideas about how I have to fill the ideas.\n\n0:12:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, I started with the first phase, I think, was the functional.\n\n0:12:09\tSPEAKER_03\n And let's see.\n\n0:12:12\tSPEAKER_03\n I had to focus on the working design, which you said.\n\n0:12:17\tSPEAKER_03\n How does the apparatus work?\n\n0:12:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, I basically had two points.\n\n0:12:24\tSPEAKER_03\n According to the coffee machine example, I have batteries to supply energy and we use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the TV.\n\n0:12:38\tSPEAKER_03\n And that's basically all I have so far.\n\n0:12:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:41\tSPEAKER_02\n I got another point.\n\n0:12:42\tSPEAKER_02\n I had to use infrared light to communicate the signal to the device.\n\n0:12:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:50\tSPEAKER_01\n So that's very common.\n\n0:12:51\tSPEAKER_00\n I had some buttons for the ON and OFF function.\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_00\n You already told that.\n\n0:12:55\tSPEAKER_00\n And for the changing to all the channels and changing the volume.\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:03\tSPEAKER_00\n The basic options for remote control.\n\n0:13:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I kept it global because that it activates the deactivate specific functions.\n\n0:13:10\tSPEAKER_03\n I wasn't thinking yet about that.\n\n0:13:12\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, you wanted to fill the channel, but you might want to use tail text also.\n\n0:13:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:18\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know what the word is in English.\n\n0:13:22\tSPEAKER_02\n So you might leave.\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:27\tSPEAKER_02\n What did the marketing expert do?\n\n0:13:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, from a marketing perspective, well, the function design phase consists of the user requirements.\n\n0:13:39\tSPEAKER_01\n What needs and desires are to be fulfilled.\n\n0:13:43\tSPEAKER_01\n So there are a few means to reach that by doing research.\n\n0:13:50\tSPEAKER_01\n To see what existing products are there out in the market.\n\n0:13:53\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, what functions do they have?\n\n0:13:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Especially what are their shortcomings?\n\n0:13:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Are there any new functions which can be added to our product?\n\n0:14:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we have to do some internet search, for example, for what kind of applications do current remote control support?\n\n0:14:14\tSPEAKER_01\n And what are future of current and future televisions?\n\n0:14:19\tSPEAKER_01\n So we can see what needs to be supported.\n\n0:14:23\tSPEAKER_01\n And we can interview current users and future users.\n\n0:14:27\tSPEAKER_01\n What would they like to see on a new remote control?\n\n0:14:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Especially for future users, I'm thinking of early adopters.\n\n0:14:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Because they use new technology first.\n\n0:14:39\tSPEAKER_01\n And they play with a lot of tools and stuff.\n\n0:14:42\tSPEAKER_01\n So maybe they have some good ideas to add.\n\n0:14:46\tSPEAKER_02\n And you can get that information?\n\n0:14:48\tSPEAKER_01\n I think I can get that information.\n\n0:14:51\tSPEAKER_02\n That's a very handy.\n\n0:14:53\tSPEAKER_02\n But have you any ideas so far as what do the user requirements are?\n\n0:14:58\tSPEAKER_01\n No, not specifically more to how to get them.\n\n0:15:01\tSPEAKER_00\n I got some requirements.\n\n0:15:03\tSPEAKER_00\n It has to be user friendly.\n\n0:15:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Really easy to use buttons.\n\n0:15:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Not very small buttons.\n\n0:15:11\tSPEAKER_00\n But also the big, big buttons.\n\n0:15:14\tSPEAKER_00\n But just normal buttons.\n\n0:15:16\tSPEAKER_00\n There's to be a small unit.\n\n0:15:19\tSPEAKER_00\n You can take it with you everywhere in your house.\n\n0:15:23\tSPEAKER_00\n So it has to be a gigantic machine.\n\n0:15:28\tSPEAKER_00\n And a good zapping range.\n\n0:15:32\tSPEAKER_02\n What do you mean by that?\n\n0:15:34\tSPEAKER_00\n The distance from your television to your remote control has to be quite a big distance.\n\n0:15:42\tSPEAKER_00\n It has to be capable for a zapping.\n\n0:15:45\tSPEAKER_01\n From the other end of the room or something.\n\n0:15:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:15:51\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment.\n\n0:15:58\tSPEAKER_02\n I think the best is to go to...\n\n0:16:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Is that you?\n\n0:16:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:10\tSPEAKER_03\n All right.\n\n0:16:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:16:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Any more points to discuss?\n\n0:16:17\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we can go ahead with what we have.\n\n0:16:22\tSPEAKER_02\n I will summarize the things we discussed and put it in the project folder.\n\n0:16:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Use the industrial designer can work on the working design, etc. etc.\n\n0:16:36\tSPEAKER_02\n And it seems you get more information by email.\n\n0:16:40\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:16:41\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:16:42\tSPEAKER_02\n It was it for me.\n\n0:16:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Thanks.\n\n0:16:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Are you going to put the notes on the project folder?\n\n0:16:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:52\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:16:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Writing very fast.\n\n0:16:55\tSPEAKER_02\n How is readable?\n\n0:16:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:16:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:16:59\tSPEAKER_02\n So, do we have more to add to the discussion?\n\n0:17:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, no, I'm just a bit wondering what we're going to do the next.\n\n0:17:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Do we only have to do a phase one, the functional design?\n\n0:17:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:12\tSPEAKER_00\n And after that, we are going to the conceptual...\n\n0:17:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:16\tSPEAKER_02\n We're just working in three phases.\n\n0:17:17\tSPEAKER_02\n We need a future work.\n\n0:17:18\tSPEAKER_02\n We have a meeting, a future work meeting.\n\n0:17:20\tSPEAKER_02\n And at the end of the day, we have the final meeting.\n\n0:17:22\tSPEAKER_02\n And then I have to prepare.\n\n0:17:24\tSPEAKER_02\n I have to defend our design.\n\n0:17:26\tSPEAKER_02\n So, make it good.\n\n0:17:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:17:28\tSPEAKER_02\n We'll do our best.\n\n0:17:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Better make it good.\n\n0:17:30\tSPEAKER_03\n I am going to work on the conceptual design already.\n\n0:17:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Because it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in.\n\n0:17:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Do we...\n\n0:17:42\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, is it going to be a multimedia control center?\n\n0:17:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Do we want to be able to use the video recording?\n\n0:17:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:48\tSPEAKER_01\n That's my question also, because like new functions...\n\n0:17:52\tSPEAKER_02\n That is the user requirements.\n\n0:17:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:55\tSPEAKER_02\n And do they want all those functions?\n\n0:17:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:59\tSPEAKER_03\n But we need good communication about this stuff.\n\n0:18:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Because I have to put the components into the design.\n\n0:18:06\tSPEAKER_00\n So, if I don't know what the components are, I was kind of...\n\n0:18:09\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we have first to start with the basic functions.\n\n0:18:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:13\tSPEAKER_00\n We can...\n\n0:18:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, like some...\n\n0:18:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Like some...\n\n0:18:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Some remotes were out there, which I know there is one button, which is very easy to switch between devices.\n\n0:18:24\tSPEAKER_01\n So, you can switch to your video and then the same buttons, control your video.\n\n0:18:29\tSPEAKER_01\n And another function, I think, of switch to your media center, because it's getting very popular.\n\n0:18:34\tSPEAKER_01\n And then use your Windows Media Center under your TV with the same remote control.\n\n0:18:40\tSPEAKER_01\n So, with the switch, one single switch.\n\n0:18:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I know what you mean, but you will need several other buttons for a video player.\n\n0:18:48\tSPEAKER_03\n You need to play and fast forward and stuff like that.\n\n0:18:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, and you don't need that for the TV.\n\n0:18:54\tSPEAKER_03\n No.\n\n0:18:55\tSPEAKER_03\n And for...\n\n0:18:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Title text.\n\n0:18:58\tSPEAKER_03\n You need additional buttons as well.\n\n0:19:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:02\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll just put my ideas in here.\n\n0:19:09\tSPEAKER_03\n And then we can...\n\n0:19:11\tSPEAKER_03\n This project...\n\n0:19:12\tSPEAKER_03\n The next...\n\n0:19:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:14\tSPEAKER_02\n We could just start with the assumption that's only for TV and video.\n\n0:19:19\tSPEAKER_02\n And then we reserve the possibility to add all the features.\n\n0:19:24\tSPEAKER_02\n So, you have a basic starting point and you can always extend that.\n\n0:19:27\tSPEAKER_02\n So, make sure it's extendable.\n\n0:19:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:30\tSPEAKER_00\n It has to be user friendly.\n\n0:19:33\tSPEAKER_00\n So, it's...\n\n0:19:34\tSPEAKER_00\n It's...\n\n0:19:35\tSPEAKER_02\n The least amount of functions possible.\n\n0:19:37\tSPEAKER_02\n So, it's easier to get to know how it works.\n\n0:19:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:42\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll see you again when the computer tells us to.\n\n0:19:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Half an hour.\n\n0:19:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:50\tSPEAKER_02\n You're the...\n\n0:19:51\tSPEAKER_02\n The business.\n\n0:19:52\tSPEAKER_02\n You're fired.\n\n0:19:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Not yet.\n\n0:19:55\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:19:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:19:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Let's move on.\n\n0:19:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's see what we've got to do.\n\n0:20:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:03\tNone\n See you later.\n\n0:20:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:07\tSPEAKER_03\n See you later.\n\n0:20:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Good luck.\n\n0:20:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Thank you.\n\n0:20:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, good luck.\n\n0:20:23\tSPEAKER_03\n What the...\n\n0:20:27\tNone\n Oh, yeah.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "SPEAKER and
