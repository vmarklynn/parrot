{"filename": "./data/ES2004d.txt", "transcript": "0:00:00\tSPEAKER_04\n Can you leave some on for a time?\n\n0:00:07\tSPEAKER_01\n It looks like a needle for all time.\n\n0:00:14\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:00:37\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:00:47\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:01:09\tSPEAKER_04\n And to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that.\n\n0:01:18\tSPEAKER_04\n And the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-RSI.\n\n0:01:28\tSPEAKER_04\n Prototype presentation.\n\n0:01:31\tSPEAKER_05\n I think that would be you.\n\n0:01:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:01:40\tSPEAKER_05\n Me and William worked on a prototype and I think William is going to make a presentation on that.\n\n0:01:45\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:01:46\tSPEAKER_05\n So I show.\n\n0:01:47\tSPEAKER_05\n I'll show you the presentation.\n\n0:01:48\tSPEAKER_05\n Can I just make it?\n\n0:01:49\tSPEAKER_04\n Yes, yes.\n\n0:01:50\tSPEAKER_04\n I'll get it.\n\n0:01:51\tSPEAKER_04\n Great.\n\n0:01:52\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, it looks.\n\n0:01:56\tSPEAKER_05\n It looks crazy over here.\n\n0:01:58\tSPEAKER_05\n Crazy on.\n\n0:02:00\tSPEAKER_04\n Thank you.\n\n0:02:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, there the hand is.\n\n0:02:18\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:02:19\tSPEAKER_05\n So this is our look and feel presentation.\n\n0:02:22\tSPEAKER_05\n The final, our final presentation.\n\n0:02:25\tSPEAKER_05\n And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've come up with over there.\n\n0:02:32\tSPEAKER_05\n It's going to have a plastic body with a sort of standard colour, either with thinking of something fairly neutral like a white or a light blue or something.\n\n0:02:46\tSPEAKER_05\n It's underneath the rubberized, the rubberized outer casing, which there'd be sort of a wide choice.\n\n0:02:55\tSPEAKER_05\n They would be attached, but we can we can count with it.\n\n0:03:00\tSPEAKER_05\n The wide choice of colours and sort of patterns.\n\n0:03:04\tSPEAKER_05\n So you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it.\n\n0:03:09\tSPEAKER_05\n It's obviously in a sort of clamshell design.\n\n0:03:14\tSPEAKER_05\n And the top LCD screen you can see there would be sort of...\n\n0:03:24\tSPEAKER_05\n How do you say this?\n\n0:03:25\tSPEAKER_05\n It would be sort of in set into the top and the buttons at the bottom would say so it would fully close flat.\n\n0:03:35\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, right.\n\n0:03:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:03:37\tSPEAKER_05\n And working on the inside with already said decided on the kinetic batteries, which actually thinking about it now, you could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well so that you could probably get a bit...\n\n0:03:54\tSPEAKER_04\n It's a bit in the top section rather than bottom section because it's in the top section.\n\n0:04:00\tSPEAKER_05\n We decided that the voice recognition system did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get hold of.\n\n0:04:10\tSPEAKER_05\n So we presume that they'd also be quite cheap.\n\n0:04:13\tSPEAKER_05\n So you'd have something like, where you'd shout out, where is the remote, and it'll shout back, I'm here or something.\n\n0:04:24\tSPEAKER_05\n And then, yeah, it won't shout out, I'm here or something. It'll just shout out, I'm here.\n\n0:04:31\tSPEAKER_05\n Or something too similar.\n\n0:04:34\tSPEAKER_05\n Or that would be too bad.\n\n0:04:35\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, if it was getting that...\n\n0:04:37\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, that could be something for next time, maybe.\n\n0:04:41\tSPEAKER_05\n You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is.\n\n0:04:44\tSPEAKER_05\n The standard transmission with the TV using all the standard chips that we've talked about.\n\n0:04:51\tSPEAKER_05\n It would have obviously, because it's split over two different layers, it would need two separate PCBs that would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling.\n\n0:05:04\tSPEAKER_05\n And because obviously all TVs use this, the same infrared medium, we'd just be using the same thing to transmit the data.\n\n0:05:16\tSPEAKER_05\n And the infrared sender would be on one of the bottom layers just at the front of the...\n\n0:05:27\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't think we actually put it on.\n\n0:05:30\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, yeah, someone would have...\n\n0:05:32\tSPEAKER_05\n Inferred could be...\n\n0:05:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, on the front, on the front side of that, yeah.\n\n0:05:36\tSPEAKER_05\n All right, yeah.\n\n0:05:37\tSPEAKER_00\n So even if it's open here, the thing that's not open here.\n\n0:05:40\tSPEAKER_05\n So when you've actually got to open it, it would be facing the TV.\n\n0:05:43\tSPEAKER_05\n And then finally, onto the interface.\n\n0:05:47\tSPEAKER_05\n The top screen, as we said, would be an inset black and white LCD touch screen, which...\n\n0:05:57\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, would have all of the available functions for the remote on it.\n\n0:06:06\tSPEAKER_05\n Whereas the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons, like the volume up and down, channel up and down, power on and off.\n\n0:06:16\tSPEAKER_05\n And things do that effect.\n\n0:06:20\tSPEAKER_05\n And now, we also decided on the inside, we could possibly either have some kind of sort of bezeled logo on it or something inset or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top.\n\n0:06:38\tSPEAKER_05\n But not interfering with that.\n\n0:06:40\tSPEAKER_04\n No, not at all.\n\n0:06:42\tSPEAKER_05\n No, not interfering with the whole look of the product when it's out on the thing.\n\n0:06:49\tSPEAKER_05\n And finally, that's how we put the fashion back into electronics.\n\n0:06:53\tSPEAKER_05\n Thanks very much.\n\n0:06:55\tSPEAKER_04\n That's a company logo.\n\n0:06:57\tSPEAKER_04\n Rapping it all out.\n\n0:06:58\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:06:59\tSPEAKER_04\n I've now got evaluation criteria.\n\n0:07:02\tSPEAKER_04\n Certainly.\n\n0:07:04\tSPEAKER_00\n So this is the one.\n\n0:07:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Sorry.\n\n0:07:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Thank you.\n\n0:07:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Oops.\n\n0:07:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Sorry.\n\n0:07:18\tSPEAKER_01\n That was a bad wish.\n\n0:07:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:27\tSPEAKER_00\n I think this is a little bit cheap.\n\n0:07:32\tSPEAKER_04\n It's quite similar to what it was before there.\n\n0:07:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:07:37\tSPEAKER_03\n This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the criteria that we got from our market research.\n\n0:07:50\tSPEAKER_03\n So this is the first stage of the evaluation.\n\n0:07:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Now, the collection of the criteria as we saw in our previous meeting was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company.\n\n0:08:01\tSPEAKER_03\n So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting.\n\n0:08:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Are we actually meeting those trends and requirements?\n\n0:08:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Now, the findings that we came up with just a recap are here.\n\n0:08:11\tSPEAKER_03\n The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel.\n\n0:08:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Technological innovation.\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_03\n It should be easy to use.\n\n0:08:20\tSPEAKER_03\n It should incorporate current fashion trends and those the two main ones.\n\n0:08:23\tSPEAKER_03\n They were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colors.\n\n0:08:28\tSPEAKER_03\n The design should minimise our SI and be easy to locate.\n\n0:08:32\tSPEAKER_03\n And we were still slightly unbivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there.\n\n0:08:37\tSPEAKER_03\n That did seem to be the favourite strategy.\n\n0:08:39\tSPEAKER_03\n But there was also on the sideline the thought of maybe having a beeper function.\n\n0:08:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:08:46\tSPEAKER_03\n So we can come back to that slide if you don't have a note of those.\n\n0:08:49\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this to what we have so far.\n\n0:08:54\tSPEAKER_03\n We're going to use a seven point scale where one is true in seven is false.\n\n0:08:59\tSPEAKER_03\n We'll look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned.\n\n0:09:02\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll call that slide back up.\n\n0:09:03\tSPEAKER_03\n And I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the white board here.\n\n0:09:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Does that seem clear? Any questions there?\n\n0:09:11\tSPEAKER_03\n So we're going to look at these.\n\n0:09:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Is it everybody's going to evaluate or just the more clear?\n\n0:09:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes. We're going to discuss each one and we'll come to our consensus rating between one and seven.\n\n0:09:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay. One is true, seven is false.\n\n0:09:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:09:29\tSPEAKER_03\n So I won't write all of that out again.\n\n0:09:31\tSPEAKER_03\n It will just be criteria one, two, three, four, five, six, or ABCDEF to confuse it with the number rating.\n\n0:09:40\tSPEAKER_03\n This is where I realize how tiny I actually am.\n\n0:09:44\tSPEAKER_04\n Just right, Farley.\n\n0:09:46\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm just going to do a few more criteria and rating.\n\n0:09:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Actually, it might be an idea if we each did give our own a division rating and we could take an average at the end.\n\n0:10:00\tSPEAKER_03\n How about that?\n\n0:10:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, you're going to be okay.\n\n0:10:03\tSPEAKER_03\n So I'll just separate the ratings by your bleeks and if we go one, two, three, four, we know who's here.\n\n0:10:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:10:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Criteria A, the fancy looking feel.\n\n0:10:21\tSPEAKER_03\n How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy, is a fancy looking feel?\n\n0:10:27\tSPEAKER_03\n One is true, seven is false.\n\n0:10:29\tSPEAKER_03\n My own rating for that would be a two.\n\n0:10:32\tSPEAKER_03\n One is true and seven is false.\n\n0:10:37\tSPEAKER_04\n How do we do that?\n\n0:10:39\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, I'd probably put it two, two or three, no three, three.\n\n0:10:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:10:49\tSPEAKER_02\n As in two.\n\n0:10:53\tSPEAKER_00\n How would you fall?\n\n0:10:54\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll fall.\n\n0:10:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:10:56\tSPEAKER_03\n I think that is up.\n\n0:10:57\tSPEAKER_03\n We've got six and a five, eleven divided by four is what?\n\n0:11:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Two and three quarter for that?\n\n0:11:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Two and two quarter?\n\n0:11:07\tSPEAKER_00\n I think so.\n\n0:11:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:11:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Two point seven five, there we go.\n\n0:11:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:11:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Criteria B, Criterion B.\n\n0:11:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Technologically innovative.\n\n0:11:20\tSPEAKER_03\n I would give that a three.\n\n0:11:26\tSPEAKER_05\n I'd give it a one.\n\n0:11:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Not that you're biased.\n\n0:11:30\tSPEAKER_03\n No, no, not at all.\n\n0:11:32\tSPEAKER_03\n The designer.\n\n0:11:35\tSPEAKER_02\n A two.\n\n0:11:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, sorry, no, I got it wrong.\n\n0:11:41\tSPEAKER_00\n The first one rating, I'm sorry.\n\n0:11:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Can you just make it two?\n\n0:11:45\tSPEAKER_00\n The average?\n\n0:11:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I just thought it was a two.\n\n0:11:48\tSPEAKER_00\n You want your rating to be a two?\n\n0:11:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Is that what you're saying?\n\n0:11:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I just got it.\n\n0:11:55\tSPEAKER_03\n So I'll work out the average for that again at the end.\n\n0:11:57\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a very slightly altered.\n\n0:11:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:12:00\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm just waiting for your rating to point five for that one.\n\n0:12:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Two point five, okay.\n\n0:12:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Using one decimal point is a big short.\n\n0:12:10\tSPEAKER_03\n So you're rating for this one, huh?\n\n0:12:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Two, okay.\n\n0:12:16\tSPEAKER_03\n So that is eight, that brings it down to two.\n\n0:12:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Two.\n\n0:12:20\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:12:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Easy to use.\n\n0:12:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Easy to use.\n\n0:12:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Based on what you've said there, I would say one.\n\n0:12:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Two.\n\n0:12:30\tNone\n Two.\n\n0:12:31\tNone\n Two.\n\n0:12:32\tSPEAKER_05\n I would say two.\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Two.\n\n0:12:34\tSPEAKER_05\n Two.\n\n0:12:35\tSPEAKER_04\n I should have said a two to make the arithmetic.\n\n0:12:39\tSPEAKER_04\n We'll just put almost two because we're not going to get into silly decimal places.\n\n0:12:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:12:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:12:49\tSPEAKER_03\n We want to really bring it down.\n\n0:12:52\tSPEAKER_03\n We can do later.\n\n0:12:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Now we're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends.\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_03\n And that's particularly in relation to our market research finding about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colour.\n\n0:13:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:13:15\tSPEAKER_03\n So I'm just thinking before I give it my rating, you were limited in the use of materials for your approach of type here.\n\n0:13:21\tSPEAKER_05\n Is this actually going to be the colours that you choose?\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_05\n No.\n\n0:13:25\tSPEAKER_05\n No.\n\n0:13:26\tSPEAKER_05\n The base colour was like all light blue.\n\n0:13:28\tSPEAKER_05\n Like all light blue.\n\n0:13:29\tSPEAKER_05\n Or sort of a light blue.\n\n0:13:30\tSPEAKER_05\n But the changeable facies would allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours.\n\n0:13:38\tSPEAKER_05\n It's full sort of customer.\n\n0:13:39\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a bit of a different colour.\n\n0:13:40\tSPEAKER_03\n So that's what we're going to do.\n\n0:13:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:13:43\tSPEAKER_03\n And the spongy feel is no problem with that.\n\n0:13:46\tSPEAKER_03\n No, no.\n\n0:13:47\tSPEAKER_05\n The spongy feel would be in a rubber that you put round it.\n\n0:13:52\tSPEAKER_05\n Otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic.\n\n0:13:55\tSPEAKER_03\n In that case it's got to be a one for me.\n\n0:13:58\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, I'll give it a one as well.\n\n0:14:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Everybody okay?\n\n0:14:03\tSPEAKER_00\n One.\n\n0:14:04\tSPEAKER_03\n That part was an opening.\n\n0:14:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:14:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Moving on to does the design minimise the repetitive strain and do...\n\n0:14:15\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't think we've really touched on that.\n\n0:14:17\tSPEAKER_03\n No.\n\n0:14:18\tSPEAKER_03\n We've discussed it.\n\n0:14:19\tSPEAKER_03\n We haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that.\n\n0:14:23\tSPEAKER_03\n We've talked about pointers but the very use of a remote control.\n\n0:14:26\tSPEAKER_03\n If you're someone who's laughing, who's sitting around and we found so many people did.\n\n0:14:29\tSPEAKER_03\n How do you minimise that such a small debate?\n\n0:14:31\tSPEAKER_04\n Well the type of button that we're going to use in the bottom here.\n\n0:14:34\tSPEAKER_04\n The material.\n\n0:14:35\tSPEAKER_04\n The mice and psaricide.\n\n0:14:37\tSPEAKER_04\n Mentue.\n\n0:14:38\tSPEAKER_04\n Mm-hmm.\n\n0:14:39\tSPEAKER_04\n Maybe because it's like with the size of the guy.\n\n0:14:44\tSPEAKER_04\n It's quite small but with the amount of stuff we put on it isn't that much.\n\n0:14:48\tSPEAKER_04\n So maybe because there's more space not kind of moving around to the...\n\n0:14:53\tSPEAKER_04\n He had accurately the buttons in between right?\n\n0:14:56\tSPEAKER_04\n It's quite obvious just big buttons.\n\n0:14:58\tSPEAKER_04\n Right.\n\n0:14:59\tSPEAKER_03\n I think I'm going to have to be neutral on that and give it a little bit more.\n\n0:15:03\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:04\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah I...\n\n0:15:06\tSPEAKER_05\n I gave her five at the time.\n\n0:15:09\tSPEAKER_05\n Five at the time.\n\n0:15:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Four and...\n\n0:15:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Four.\n\n0:15:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Four and a half.\n\n0:15:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Twenty one.\n\n0:15:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Twenty one so that's four point two five.\n\n0:15:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Yep.\n\n0:15:23\tSPEAKER_03\n And finally last but not least.\n\n0:15:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Easy to locate.\n\n0:15:29\tSPEAKER_03\n So we talked about voice recognition.\n\n0:15:31\tSPEAKER_03\n We talked about a beeper.\n\n0:15:32\tSPEAKER_03\n We really never had to come to any...\n\n0:15:34\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah it was a voice recognition.\n\n0:15:37\tSPEAKER_03\n It was the honest recognition.\n\n0:15:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:40\tSPEAKER_03\n And we're happy with the costs and that.\n\n0:15:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah yeah that.\n\n0:15:44\tSPEAKER_05\n Cost wise.\n\n0:15:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah that's feasible.\n\n0:15:46\tSPEAKER_03\n That sounds good then.\n\n0:15:47\tSPEAKER_03\n I'd go for...\n\n0:15:48\tSPEAKER_03\n We can adjust the volume on that just as we could volume on TV.\n\n0:15:52\tSPEAKER_03\n I think you...\n\n0:15:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Some of the other room on TV's different rooms.\n\n0:15:56\tSPEAKER_05\n I think it would probably be a stand...\n\n0:15:59\tSPEAKER_05\n It would be a stand...\n\n0:16:00\tSPEAKER_05\n It would be quite loud.\n\n0:16:02\tSPEAKER_05\n Everything.\n\n0:16:03\tSPEAKER_05\n So it would be...\n\n0:16:04\tSPEAKER_04\n And if you didn't hear it in the room you were standing in then you realise it wasn't in that room.\n\n0:16:08\tSPEAKER_03\n It's logical.\n\n0:16:10\tSPEAKER_03\n That's the one for me.\n\n0:16:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah one.\n\n0:16:13\tSPEAKER_03\n One.\n\n0:16:14\tSPEAKER_03\n One.\n\n0:16:15\tSPEAKER_02\n And one.\n\n0:16:16\tSPEAKER_05\n I do realise we might be being fairly biased because it is a problem.\n\n0:16:22\tSPEAKER_03\n So how do we feel about this?\n\n0:16:26\tSPEAKER_03\n We've got our...\n\n0:16:27\tSPEAKER_03\n The highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the six criteria there.\n\n0:16:35\tSPEAKER_03\n That is for incorporates current fashion trends and of easy to locate.\n\n0:16:41\tSPEAKER_03\n The lowest rating we've got which is really...\n\n0:16:43\tSPEAKER_03\n It's not terribly low, it's close around neutral is for the minimisation of repetitive strain injury.\n\n0:16:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Do we feel on the basis of that of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it or do we have to make further modification?\n\n0:17:01\tSPEAKER_04\n I don't think so.\n\n0:17:03\tSPEAKER_04\n I think so.\n\n0:17:05\tSPEAKER_03\n I think for most of those rating that is high enough that the upper end of this scale goes ahead with that.\n\n0:17:11\tSPEAKER_03\n And I really don't if on the basis of current technology and of current capability you could actually do much...\n\n0:17:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Do you march in the middle of the night?\n\n0:17:19\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm having a huge big...\n\n0:17:21\tSPEAKER_03\n I know.\n\n0:17:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:17:23\tSPEAKER_03\n And I hope that the clear to the team is there anything you would like to ask me about the findings for...\n\n0:17:29\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm not...\n\n0:17:30\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm not...\n\n0:17:33\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm going to do it there.\n\n0:17:35\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, thank you.\n\n0:17:44\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, I've got finance in there.\n\n0:17:47\tSPEAKER_04\n I'm going to plug this in so you can see it.\n\n0:17:50\tSPEAKER_04\n That's okay.\n\n0:17:52\tSPEAKER_04\n I don't know.\n\n0:17:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Do you want me to unplug that?\n\n0:18:00\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:01\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:02\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:18:11\tSPEAKER_01\n So this...\n\n0:18:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:18:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:18:32\tSPEAKER_04\n Now I presume that the screen will be applied.\n\n0:18:37\tSPEAKER_04\n That...\n\n0:18:45\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:18:47\tSPEAKER_04\n We just type numbers into this and we come out the final value.\n\n0:18:52\tSPEAKER_04\n So I was still on for kinetic.\n\n0:18:55\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:56\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay. So it would have been handy to have this beginning.\n\n0:19:00\tSPEAKER_04\n It might have been a starting choice.\n\n0:19:05\tSPEAKER_04\n Right.\n\n0:19:06\tSPEAKER_04\n What's happening with the electronics?\n\n0:19:08\tSPEAKER_05\n There's regular chip on print and...\n\n0:19:18\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh no, no, no.\n\n0:19:19\tSPEAKER_05\n The...\n\n0:19:21\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, it's...\n\n0:19:22\tSPEAKER_05\n You've put in three for the number of kinetic cells.\n\n0:19:26\tSPEAKER_05\n There should just be one.\n\n0:19:28\tSPEAKER_05\n In the top, it's the number.\n\n0:19:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, right.\n\n0:19:31\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:19:32\tSPEAKER_04\n Thanks.\n\n0:19:34\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, and...\n\n0:19:35\tSPEAKER_04\n So would there be two?\n\n0:19:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, just...\n\n0:19:37\tSPEAKER_05\n No, one rig...\n\n0:19:39\tSPEAKER_05\n One chip?\n\n0:19:40\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, one of them had one sample sensor and sample speed.\n\n0:19:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:19:48\tSPEAKER_05\n And a double curve.\n\n0:19:50\tSPEAKER_05\n Single one double curve.\n\n0:19:52\tSPEAKER_05\n Two, because it's too low.\n\n0:19:54\tSPEAKER_03\n So it has a slightly flat and bottom third conflict.\n\n0:19:57\tSPEAKER_04\n So what's a single curve?\n\n0:19:59\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, I'd say it always...\n\n0:20:01\tSPEAKER_05\n It's a one bottom with one curve.\n\n0:20:03\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, I think it's...\n\n0:20:05\tSPEAKER_04\n So there's one double curve.\n\n0:20:07\tSPEAKER_05\n And what, no, because one...\n\n0:20:09\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, one's double curved and then the other one is...\n\n0:20:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, it's a bit flat, but it's slightly flat and the bottom sort of goes...\n\n0:20:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Plastic and rubber, from the way.\n\n0:20:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:20:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Plastic one and maybe a double point color.\n\n0:20:24\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, I like it.\n\n0:20:26\tSPEAKER_00\n No, I think rubber, since it's being used just as a casing, we can put 0.5.\n\n0:20:31\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:32\tSPEAKER_04\n Do you think?\n\n0:20:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, because there are...\n\n0:20:35\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it allows the 0.5 here.\n\n0:20:37\tSPEAKER_00\n We can use that.\n\n0:20:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:20:41\tSPEAKER_03\n What does it mean if you put 0.5?\n\n0:20:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we're using a lot of rubber actually, because...\n\n0:20:46\tSPEAKER_00\n I would be like saying we're using a very low quantity of rubber, compared to plastic.\n\n0:20:50\tSPEAKER_04\n See, it says case material.\n\n0:20:54\tSPEAKER_04\n So we're not actually using plastic in a case?\n\n0:20:57\tSPEAKER_04\n No, no, it's as an extra.\n\n0:20:59\tSPEAKER_04\n It's pretty interesting.\n\n0:21:00\tSPEAKER_05\n So that shouldn't be actually on there, because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote.\n\n0:21:06\tSPEAKER_05\n You get...\n\n0:21:07\tSPEAKER_03\n But it is going to be part of the total cost and there's nowhere else we can put that in, is there?\n\n0:21:11\tSPEAKER_03\n There's nowhere else we can code for the rubber used in the casing.\n\n0:21:14\tSPEAKER_03\n So do we not have to account for it in a cost somewhere there?\n\n0:21:17\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, we'll just put it in as...\n\n0:21:20\tSPEAKER_04\n We'll put it in as half.\n\n0:21:22\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:21:23\tSPEAKER_04\n We should just put it in as one, because plastic is either anyway.\n\n0:21:26\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:21:27\tSPEAKER_05\n There we go.\n\n0:21:29\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, special colour, do you believe that?\n\n0:21:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Night do.\n\n0:21:35\tSPEAKER_03\n If we go for some of them, we'll exotic rubber jeans and such light colour.\n\n0:21:39\tSPEAKER_04\n Interface.\n\n0:21:41\tSPEAKER_05\n Push button.\n\n0:21:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, the push buttons, one and L.C. display one.\n\n0:21:49\tSPEAKER_05\n One and buttons.\n\n0:21:51\tSPEAKER_05\n One and buttons.\n\n0:22:21\tNone\n You I think we could change the battery also, so we're going for kind of the hovered, going for the standard battery.\n\n0:22:57\tSPEAKER_03\n If you click off that square now, I mean, any difference.\n\n0:23:02\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, it's on the front light.\n\n0:23:04\tSPEAKER_04\n It's on the front light.\n\n0:23:06\tSPEAKER_03\n So it's on curved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved things,\n\n0:23:10\tSPEAKER_00\n and then to make a difference. On curved flat.\n\n0:23:15\tSPEAKER_03\n No, it's not made any difference, right?\n\n0:23:18\tSPEAKER_03\n No, well, it's just prizes.\n\n0:23:19\tSPEAKER_05\n No, no, you've got to click off to calculate it again.\n\n0:23:22\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, there we go.\n\n0:23:23\tSPEAKER_04\n It's slightly.\n\n0:23:24\tSPEAKER_05\n It might be assuming that that is in Euros, it could be in dollars.\n\n0:23:31\tSPEAKER_05\n And then would be fine because the exchange rate may get better.\n\n0:23:36\tSPEAKER_04\n We haven't been dealing with dollars though.\n\n0:23:39\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's some new ones.\n\n0:23:41\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, so the highest we've got is the electronics here.\n\n0:23:48\tSPEAKER_04\n And the engine base.\n\n0:23:50\tSPEAKER_03\n If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery, and just going to do a number of batteries without making a huge difference.\n\n0:23:57\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, the standard.\n\n0:23:58\tSPEAKER_05\n It would make one difference.\n\n0:24:00\tSPEAKER_05\n The biggest one would be taking away, if you took away.\n\n0:24:04\tSPEAKER_00\n What I feel is customers never said anything about the battery.\n\n0:24:07\tSPEAKER_00\n It's internal.\n\n0:24:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Nobody looks into the battery.\n\n0:24:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:10\tSPEAKER_00\n But shape and color.\n\n0:24:11\tSPEAKER_05\n If you take away the voice, I don't like to say it.\n\n0:24:14\tSPEAKER_05\n If you take away the voice recognition, then you've got it.\n\n0:24:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Voice that's a special color.\n\n0:24:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Do we see what difference it made?\n\n0:24:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Where is the voice recognition?\n\n0:24:25\tSPEAKER_05\n It's sample, sent to sample speaker.\n\n0:24:29\tSPEAKER_05\n Took away that, they'll make it 12.35.\n\n0:24:32\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, the kinetic is 3.\n\n0:24:33\tSPEAKER_04\n If we change it to the battery, that's minus 3.\n\n0:24:37\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, but you minus 3 plus 2.\n\n0:24:40\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, right.\n\n0:24:49\tSPEAKER_04\n We can do it some other way.\n\n0:24:51\tSPEAKER_04\n It doesn't have to be voice recognition.\n\n0:24:53\tSPEAKER_04\n We could do the voice recognition for business class or something.\n\n0:24:58\tSPEAKER_04\n Like an upgraded version.\n\n0:25:00\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:01\tSPEAKER_05\n You could choose to have a much better battery.\n\n0:25:03\tSPEAKER_05\n But I mean, I don't see why we have to set up 25 years now.\n\n0:25:08\tSPEAKER_05\n So they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for a better product.\n\n0:25:12\tSPEAKER_03\n But we were still working to...\n\n0:25:14\tSPEAKER_03\n So should we just change the size of this location?\n\n0:25:16\tSPEAKER_03\n In our recommendation.\n\n0:25:17\tSPEAKER_03\n If we're working to head off the specifications, this is what this project is working for.\n\n0:25:22\tSPEAKER_03\n We can do in our recommendations with what we've found and what the consensus that we've come to is a job.\n\n0:25:27\tSPEAKER_03\n We can.\n\n0:25:28\tSPEAKER_03\n But we need to work to that specification to start with.\n\n0:25:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, we can think.\n\n0:25:31\tSPEAKER_03\n The voice recognition sounds wonderful, but our object is so distinctive that that in itself we make it easier to locate as you know in our first instance.\n\n0:25:40\tSPEAKER_03\n As you say, we can offer the voice recognition an issue to business class customers.\n\n0:25:45\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, we can make the price fit and then say...\n\n0:25:50\tSPEAKER_04\n And then say, we recommend...\n\n0:25:52\tSPEAKER_04\n We would have had this because it also sets apart.\n\n0:25:55\tSPEAKER_04\n Because we don't have a background.\n\n0:25:56\tSPEAKER_03\n We like to go through that.\n\n0:25:57\tSPEAKER_04\n They want to like something that's completely different.\n\n0:26:00\tSPEAKER_04\n Yes.\n\n0:26:01\tSPEAKER_04\n Because someone completely different associated with your company.\n\n0:26:03\tSPEAKER_04\n Right, okay.\n\n0:26:04\tSPEAKER_03\n So, if we take voice recognition, I...\n\n0:26:07\tSPEAKER_03\n I...\n\n0:26:08\tSPEAKER_05\n...stow the...\n\n0:26:10\tSPEAKER_05\n...12.3.5.\n\n0:26:12\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, that's what we're talking about.\n\n0:26:13\tSPEAKER_05\n Is it 12.50?\n\n0:26:15\tSPEAKER_05\n Two sides.\n\n0:26:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Is it 12.50?\n\n0:26:17\tSPEAKER_04\n No, it's 12.25.\n\n0:26:19\tSPEAKER_04\n Are you sure?\n\n0:26:20\tSPEAKER_04\n Sorry, not meaning to doubt your work.\n\n0:26:22\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, well, two...\n\n0:26:23\tSPEAKER_04\n...12.25 times two.\n\n0:26:25\tNone\n I...\n\n0:26:26\tSPEAKER_04\n...25.\n\n0:26:27\tSPEAKER_04\n Are they going to be in a circle by 10p?\n\n0:26:29\tSPEAKER_03\n It's 12.5 per unit.\n\n0:26:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Now, quite zero, one over euro.\n\n0:26:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Which is less than 10p.\n\n0:26:41\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know, would...\n\n0:26:42\tSPEAKER_00\n It's said 50% is a cost.\n\n0:26:44\tSPEAKER_00\n So, half of the price of it.\n\n0:26:46\tSPEAKER_04\n The other one was where the price was, isn't it?\n\n0:26:52\tSPEAKER_00\n What is the cost for?\n\n0:26:54\tSPEAKER_02\n That's today.\n\n0:26:56\tNone\n 12.5?\n\n0:26:58\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:59\tSPEAKER_02\n So, we are under the...\n\n0:27:01\tSPEAKER_04\n...12.5?\n\n0:27:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, so we are under the...\n\n0:27:06\tSPEAKER_02\n...12.5.\n\n0:27:07\tSPEAKER_02\n So, we are okay.\n\n0:27:10\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:27:11\tSPEAKER_04\n So, is that...\n\n0:27:12\tSPEAKER_04\n...got us covered for the electronics then?\n\n0:27:14\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:15\tSPEAKER_04\n We don't need something else to take that place.\n\n0:27:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Nope.\n\n0:27:17\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:27:18\tSPEAKER_05\n Because that was just a bolt on X-ray.\n\n0:27:21\tSPEAKER_05\n You could just take it out.\n\n0:27:23\tSPEAKER_05\n And it would be fine.\n\n0:27:25\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:27:33\tSPEAKER_00\n It seems fine.\n\n0:27:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, thanks a voice for the commission everything is...\n\n0:27:38\tSPEAKER_04\n Right.\n\n0:27:39\tSPEAKER_04\n Done, man.\n\n0:27:42\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:27:43\tSPEAKER_04\n Product evaluation.\n\n0:27:46\tSPEAKER_04\n We've done room for creativity, haven't we?\n\n0:27:49\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:50\tSPEAKER_04\n We've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't.\n\n0:27:53\tSPEAKER_04\n We didn't feel able to make.\n\n0:27:55\tSPEAKER_04\n Um...\n\n0:27:57\tSPEAKER_04\n A presume we discussed leadership and teamwork?\n\n0:28:00\tNone\n Uh-huh.\n\n0:28:03\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:28:04\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:05\tSPEAKER_04\n Um, in the sense that...\n\n0:28:08\tSPEAKER_04\n...um...\n\n0:28:10\tSPEAKER_04\n...did you feel like a team or did you feel like?\n\n0:28:14\tNone\n All right.\n\n0:28:15\tSPEAKER_05\n Say, is a team?\n\n0:28:16\tSPEAKER_05\n I think we were talking.\n\n0:28:17\tSPEAKER_03\n I think we were talking.\n\n0:28:18\tSPEAKER_03\n There was so much interaction, so much that we needed to...\n\n0:28:21\tSPEAKER_03\n...find our soul feature.\n\n0:28:23\tSPEAKER_03\n And I've certainly felt heard, listened to...\n\n0:28:26\tSPEAKER_03\n...on that in relevant areas we've been able to, you know, give and take.\n\n0:28:30\tSPEAKER_03\n And adjust our remit.\n\n0:28:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:32\tSPEAKER_03\n We're necessary.\n\n0:28:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I think it was a very constructive feedback by everybody.\n\n0:28:37\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not like people trying to cut each other.\n\n0:28:40\tSPEAKER_00\n It was more of a through cohesive teamwork.\n\n0:28:42\tSPEAKER_00\n We came to a very pretty creative design.\n\n0:28:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:47\tSPEAKER_00\n And, uh... yeah, I think, and Sarah, you coordinated the book very well.\n\n0:28:51\tSPEAKER_04\n Thank you.\n\n0:28:53\tSPEAKER_04\n How did you find it?\n\n0:28:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, no, I thought it went really well.\n\n0:28:58\tSPEAKER_05\n And I, yeah, I felt that everyone was listening to.\n\n0:29:02\tSPEAKER_05\n And all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out.\n\n0:29:08\tSPEAKER_05\n But we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there.\n\n0:29:12\tSPEAKER_05\n So that's good.\n\n0:29:13\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:14\tSPEAKER_05\n I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually.\n\n0:29:18\tSPEAKER_05\n If we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out, I think maybe it would have come out a little different.\n\n0:29:28\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:29\tSPEAKER_04\n I like the fact that we could say an idea, and it'd be suggested that there wasn't the best idea, but no one felt like a short time.\n\n0:29:38\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:39\tSPEAKER_04\n It didn't matter, saying what you got, because if it wasn't something that was that relevant and it didn't matter, it was just another idea.\n\n0:29:47\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:48\tSPEAKER_04\n And teamwork, well, you too created that wonderful specimen of a play-doh model.\n\n0:29:55\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:56\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that was the best part of that.\n\n0:30:00\tSPEAKER_04\n I'm still not caught up.\n\n0:30:02\tSPEAKER_04\n That's nothing to do with the teamwork, though.\n\n0:30:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe we should think of branching it into children's toy, fake mobile phones, or the provide one.\n\n0:30:12\tSPEAKER_03\n The fake one.\n\n0:30:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that was quite fun.\n\n0:30:15\tSPEAKER_04\n It means whiteboard digital pens, etc.\n\n0:30:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Or the fact that we have to be allowed to use the device, which was for communicating and sharing information.\n\n0:30:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Could it have been better?\n\n0:30:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Was it adequate?\n\n0:30:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:29\tSPEAKER_05\n I think we probably would have used the Azure E-Mouse system more had we actually.\n\n0:30:35\tSPEAKER_04\n It had time to kind of.\n\n0:30:37\tSPEAKER_05\n It had more time, and if we'd been separated more.\n\n0:30:41\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, because we could just say, sorry, what do you say about that, or what do you think about that?\n\n0:30:46\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:47\tSPEAKER_04\n Rather than having to imagine it.\n\n0:30:48\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:49\tSPEAKER_04\n But it was nice having it there.\n\n0:30:52\tSPEAKER_04\n Like the whole picture of the thing.\n\n0:30:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:55\tSPEAKER_00\n But it didn't like moving around the room.\n\n0:30:57\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's good.\n\n0:30:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Like we spend times individually.\n\n0:31:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:35\tSPEAKER_00\n I never thought of a remote control with a flip top.\n\n0:31:40\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, I think it's.\n\n0:31:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Actually, the following from other areas is bringing things from other areas in.\n\n0:31:45\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, nothing in the new.\n\n0:31:47\tSPEAKER_03\n But it's applying it to a different area.\n\n0:31:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Vegetables.\n\n0:31:50\tSPEAKER_00\n That's mine.\n\n0:31:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:53\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:55\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:56\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, they have to come from somewhere.\n\n0:31:58\tSPEAKER_04\n Absolutely.\n\n0:31:59\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:00\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's.\n\n0:32:01\tSPEAKER_04\n And as, as we're shown by your presentation with all of the other controls, remote controls, no one's thought about it.\n\n0:32:11\tSPEAKER_04\n No.\n\n0:32:12\tSPEAKER_04\n Particularly.\n\n0:32:13\tSPEAKER_04\n I mean, there's slightly differences.\n\n0:32:14\tSPEAKER_04\n Someone's been shot in a room and said, make ours a bit different from everyone else's.\n\n0:32:17\tSPEAKER_04\n Because there's something we should think about.\n\n0:32:19\tSPEAKER_04\n But obviously, no one's putting a great deal of thought into it.\n\n0:32:22\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't think the companies are really concerned.\n\n0:32:26\tSPEAKER_05\n We've got a DVD player.\n\n0:32:27\tSPEAKER_05\n Does anyone remember the remote control?\n\n0:32:29\tSPEAKER_05\n Can't you get the one that we used for the last one?\n\n0:32:32\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, just jazz it up with it.\n\n0:32:34\tSPEAKER_05\n They don't really think about it.\n\n0:32:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Because normally, the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship.\n\n0:32:39\tSPEAKER_05\n They're trying to ship the DVD player, the video, the TV.\n\n0:32:42\tSPEAKER_04\n But then when everything is really smart.\n\n0:32:44\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:45\tSPEAKER_04\n And you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table.\n\n0:32:49\tSPEAKER_04\n And if you haven't got a book, you can have something that's a proper, funky thing, a funky item, an individual to you.\n\n0:32:57\tSPEAKER_04\n I mean, they could even go into you going with an idea, a new designer on Photoshop.\n\n0:33:03\tSPEAKER_04\n And then they just get it printed on the plastic.\n\n0:33:05\tSPEAKER_04\n You would pay a lot extra because it's individually being plastic, it was being made for you.\n\n0:33:12\tSPEAKER_04\n But people could have had anything that they wanted.\n\n0:33:17\tSPEAKER_00\n And the surprising thing is people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones.\n\n0:33:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Every month, you see a new launch or something like that.\n\n0:33:26\tSPEAKER_00\n And new television products coming up.\n\n0:33:28\tSPEAKER_00\n But nobody giving a much idea to this.\n\n0:33:31\tSPEAKER_03\n I think this has been very market research-based.\n\n0:33:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Because just going back to mobile phones.\n\n0:33:38\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really say is that it's obvious and visible.\n\n0:33:44\tSPEAKER_03\n We see it in mobile phones a lot.\n\n0:33:47\tSPEAKER_03\n There are innovations in that that people don't really want.\n\n0:33:51\tSPEAKER_03\n I see people wanting a model of the phone that we're really happy with and they can't get it anymore.\n\n0:33:55\tSPEAKER_03\n It's innovation for innovation's sake.\n\n0:33:57\tSPEAKER_03\n And I think it's wonderful that our companies are on deep aid.\n\n0:34:00\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, it's innovation for money's sake.\n\n0:34:03\tSPEAKER_03\n The people have to keep it.\n\n0:34:05\tSPEAKER_03\n The first thing it onto people, they might want to buy the thing they've been doing.\n\n0:34:09\tSPEAKER_04\n And you can't get your hands at the work's fine, but you can't get battery anymore.\n\n0:34:12\tSPEAKER_04\n And with that type of phone, there's the phones have moved on.\n\n0:34:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Things like that.\n\n0:34:16\tSPEAKER_03\n There's a cover to fit it.\n\n0:34:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:21\tSPEAKER_04\n In closing.\n\n0:34:24\tSPEAKER_04\n Close up.\n\n0:34:27\tSPEAKER_04\n Our costs are blow budget with recommendations for the budget being increased.\n\n0:34:33\tSPEAKER_04\n But I think, I don't know, what do you think?\n\n0:34:36\tSPEAKER_04\n Do you think that takes into account overheads?\n\n0:34:41\tSPEAKER_04\n Like us being well paid for everything.\n\n0:34:44\tSPEAKER_04\n And the heating for the building, do you think our budget includes everything all the costs that are going out?\n\n0:34:50\tSPEAKER_04\n I think it was just the product.\n\n0:34:52\tSPEAKER_04\n I think that was just the physical.\n\n0:34:54\tSPEAKER_04\n So it looks, well, it looks like it's going to be 50% profit.\n\n0:34:57\tSPEAKER_04\n It's still gone.\n\n0:34:58\tSPEAKER_04\n All of it overheads might have been.\n\n0:35:00\tSPEAKER_04\n So maybe increasing it, you would also have to increase the price of it.\n\n0:35:05\tSPEAKER_04\n So we'll do it.\n\n0:35:07\tSPEAKER_04\n But you were saying that that's right.\n\n0:35:09\tSPEAKER_03\n And the reason we're giving it a very specific, I think we've done what we're required to do.\n\n0:35:13\tSPEAKER_03\n And I think like the other project team or any project we're able to look at, at those kind of things, I don't think that's something we have to look at and underweigh a reading of the cash for.\n\n0:35:23\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, it was.\n\n0:35:24\tSPEAKER_03\n It's done very well to get within budget.\n\n0:35:26\tSPEAKER_03\n And it still makes such an innovative item.\n\n0:35:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:31\tSPEAKER_04\n So I think people are really going to want to shame it or never get it.\n\n0:35:35\tSPEAKER_04\n Maybe they're going to steal our idea.\n\n0:35:38\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a top-sanker.\n\n0:35:39\tSPEAKER_05\n It's a conspiracy going on here.\n\n0:35:44\tSPEAKER_04\n The project has been evaluated well and true.\n\n0:35:47\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:48\tSPEAKER_04\n And I've got the meeting summary in question here.\n\n0:35:51\tSPEAKER_04\n There's a fine question.\n\n0:35:52\tSPEAKER_04\n So we've got about 50 minutes to catch up with everything that I've found by God.\n\n0:35:59\tSPEAKER_04\n So I'll be delegating it.\n\n0:36:01\tSPEAKER_04\n I am in your last project, super rising.\n\n0:36:04\tSPEAKER_04\n So good luck.\n\n0:36:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Celebration, you've been doggled with that.\n\n0:36:10\tSPEAKER_04\n I think that celebration is a 25 times.\n\n0:36:13\tSPEAKER_04\n That will be dance in the dance.\n\n0:36:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:36:17\tSPEAKER_05\n What's that about then?\n\n0:36:25\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, just the last, I think.\n\n0:36:31\tSPEAKER_05\n Awesome.\n\n0:36:32\tSPEAKER_04\n I think I've got minutes for two of the meetings and last thing.\n\n0:36:38\tSPEAKER_04\n Question, you've done?\n\n0:36:41\tSPEAKER_03\n I didn't have to rate you on how much you're influenced the meeting with the time.\n\n0:36:45\tSPEAKER_05\n Is that not very question-f, or how you've done in the thing?\n\n0:36:50\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm right.\n\n0:36:51\tSPEAKER_03\n But do we not sometimes evaluate the meeting?\n\n0:36:54\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, there it is.\n\n0:36:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:56\tSPEAKER_05\n I think, yeah, question is seven.\n\n0:36:58\tSPEAKER_05\n So I'm going to put it in the floor.\n\n0:37:01\tSPEAKER_04\n I'll just go.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "SPEAKER and William worked on a prototype.
