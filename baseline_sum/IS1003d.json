"0:00:30\tSPEAKER_02\n...\n\n0:00:38\tSPEAKER_02\n...\n\n0:00:39\tSPEAKER_03\n...\n\n0:00:40\tSPEAKER_03\n...\n\n0:00:52\tSPEAKER_01\n...\n\n0:00:56\tSPEAKER_02\n...\n\n0:00:58\tSPEAKER_03\n...\n\n0:01:02\tSPEAKER_01\n...\n\n0:01:08\tSPEAKER_01\n...\n\n0:01:12\tSPEAKER_01\n...\n\n0:01:16\tSPEAKER_01\n...\n\n0:01:20\tSPEAKER_01\n...\n\n0:01:23\tSPEAKER_01\n...\n\n0:01:26\tSPEAKER_01\n...dei vii Jordan.\n\n0:01:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Ja.\n\n0:01:29\tSPEAKER_01\n...aina, industrida, designer, baba.\n\n0:01:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Ja.\n\n0:01:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Ok.\n\n0:01:34\tSPEAKER_01\n So we'll have to evaluate your proposed remote control.\n\n0:01:39\tSPEAKER_01\n...and have an idea of the price that this thing could cost you.\n\n0:01:47\tSPEAKER_01\n...and in case if we all agree on the fabric of building our these remote control, we'll evaluate the production.\n\n0:02:00\tSPEAKER_01\n So maybe I will let the our two designers talk about some...\n\n0:02:06\tSPEAKER_01\n I have a slide.\n\n0:02:07\tSPEAKER_01\n...there.\n\n0:02:08\tSPEAKER_01\n You have to, sorry, oops.\n\n0:02:10\tSPEAKER_02\n...participatory one slide and maybe you can product, product, discuss every slide.\n\n0:02:16\tSPEAKER_02\n...ok.\n\n0:02:20\tSPEAKER_02\n...ok.\n\n0:02:23\tSPEAKER_02\n So this is our product prototype.\n\n0:02:28\tSPEAKER_02\n This is made by Klyn.\n\n0:02:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Looks strange.\n\n0:02:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:02:32\tSPEAKER_02\n The basic color is yellow and red.\n\n0:02:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Yellow is our company color.\n\n0:02:41\tSPEAKER_02\n I read it is more attractive.\n\n0:02:46\tSPEAKER_02\n So we use two basic colors, yellow and red.\n\n0:02:49\tSPEAKER_02\n At the ship there's two basic ships.\n\n0:02:52\tSPEAKER_02\n The first is a cycle and the second is a triangle space.\n\n0:02:58\tSPEAKER_02\n We call it mushroom design.\n\n0:03:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Looks like some mushroom.\n\n0:03:02\tSPEAKER_02\n So we call it mushroom design.\n\n0:03:04\tSPEAKER_02\n So this is the introduction of our product.\n\n0:03:06\tSPEAKER_01\n...channel tickling modified mushroom, I will say.\n\n0:03:09\tSPEAKER_01\n...ok.\n\n0:03:10\tSPEAKER_02\n...ok.\n\n0:03:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, the next slide.\n\n0:03:13\tSPEAKER_02\n So there are several key features of our prototype.\n\n0:03:16\tSPEAKER_02\n The first is that it is fancy.\n\n0:03:19\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm sure this would be the unique design in the market.\n\n0:03:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe I hope so.\n\n0:03:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, so it's a fancy design and a unique design.\n\n0:03:28\tSPEAKER_02\n And the second key feature is that the circle channel selection.\n\n0:03:37\tSPEAKER_02\n In the traditional controller, you use button to select the channel.\n\n0:03:42\tSPEAKER_02\n But now we have a circle.\n\n0:03:46\tSPEAKER_02\n So we can take this ball to select channel.\n\n0:03:49\tSPEAKER_02\n It's quite convenient for a user to use it.\n\n0:03:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but don't touch.\n\n0:03:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Don't destroy your first time.\n\n0:03:56\tSPEAKER_02\n The third feature is the stable triangle base.\n\n0:04:01\tSPEAKER_02\n This triangle base is very stable.\n\n0:04:07\tSPEAKER_02\n So it's unlikely you cannot find it.\n\n0:04:11\tSPEAKER_02\n So you can put it in the table.\n\n0:04:14\tSPEAKER_02\n So you can turn the ball to select channel.\n\n0:04:20\tSPEAKER_02\n And there's some cube button.\n\n0:04:22\tSPEAKER_02\n You can see the shape of the button is a mushroom.\n\n0:04:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Everything is mushroom.\n\n0:04:29\tSPEAKER_01\n So we can call our remote control that mushroom.\n\n0:04:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Mushroom is not really mushroom because you have a lemon shape.\n\n0:04:38\tSPEAKER_02\n That's why if you put it in the table, you can't eat it.\n\n0:04:45\tSPEAKER_02\n I hope you don't eat it anyway.\n\n0:04:48\tSPEAKER_02\n You know, trying to create the food aspect.\n\n0:04:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, because mushroom was not in the trends.\n\n0:04:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Vegetables.\n\n0:04:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Vegetables are the kind of mushroom.\n\n0:05:01\tSPEAKER_02\n It's vegetable.\n\n0:05:04\tSPEAKER_02\n It's something easy to eat.\n\n0:05:08\tSPEAKER_02\n We integrated the different colors.\n\n0:05:11\tSPEAKER_03\n This is not mushroom anyway.\n\n0:05:14\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable by using these colors.\n\n0:05:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Inspired color.\n\n0:05:25\tSPEAKER_02\n And very sophisticated material.\n\n0:05:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Next slide.\n\n0:05:35\tSPEAKER_02\n What I can add is that he talked about what is outside.\n\n0:05:41\tSPEAKER_02\n What is inside is what we talked before about the chip.\n\n0:05:46\tSPEAKER_02\n It is a low level chip.\n\n0:05:48\tSPEAKER_02\n We don't need to cut it.\n\n0:05:51\tSPEAKER_02\n The low level chips inside and the LCD button.\n\n0:05:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Where is the battery?\n\n0:05:59\tSPEAKER_02\n It is in the basement.\n\n0:06:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Where is the solar cell?\n\n0:06:08\tSPEAKER_02\n This is a kind of new revolutionary receptor that we can put outside.\n\n0:06:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Do you think it wants to be increased the price?\n\n0:06:19\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think so.\n\n0:06:22\tSPEAKER_01\n It might be okay.\n\n0:06:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Mr. Monet, what is your opinion according to this remote control?\n\n0:06:32\tSPEAKER_03\n We will try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about it.\n\n0:06:39\tSPEAKER_03\n We have three key points for this remote control design.\n\n0:06:47\tSPEAKER_03\n First one was fancy.\n\n0:06:55\tSPEAKER_03\n You can feel.\n\n0:06:58\tSPEAKER_03\n We will try to judge this feature with a 1-7 scale.\n\n0:07:03\tSPEAKER_03\n One being no.\n\n0:07:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Just let me check.\n\n0:07:10\tSPEAKER_02\n 4.3.5, it means it is acceptable.\n\n0:07:13\tSPEAKER_03\n The 1 being true and 7 being false.\n\n0:07:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Oops.\n\n0:07:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Do we have a fancy look and feel?\n\n0:07:25\tSPEAKER_02\n I think you have nice colors.\n\n0:07:28\tSPEAKER_02\n The shape is unique.\n\n0:07:31\tSPEAKER_03\n I agree.\n\n0:07:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Is it fancy?\n\n0:07:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:07:40\tSPEAKER_03\n It was defined by fruit and vegetable look.\n\n0:07:44\tSPEAKER_02\n You have the lemon aspect of this.\n\n0:07:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out, maybe you do things like that.\n\n0:07:57\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know where the lemon is, but this shape is the lemon.\n\n0:08:02\tSPEAKER_01\n It would be better, more like a lemon.\n\n0:08:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe improving the texture, having less buttons.\n\n0:08:13\tSPEAKER_02\n So my mush.\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Looks like more fruit.\n\n0:08:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe a pineapple?\n\n0:08:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:08:25\tSPEAKER_01\n You have the finger here with the buttons?\n\n0:08:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:08:32\tSPEAKER_01\n It looks like a pineapple.\n\n0:08:36\tSPEAKER_01\n What is the use for that?\n\n0:08:39\tSPEAKER_02\n If you want to tame the ball, it is very convenient for you to tame the ball, to change the channel.\n\n0:08:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Where is the voice recognition?\n\n0:08:51\tSPEAKER_02\n It is embedded.\n\n0:08:54\tSPEAKER_03\n That is the second point.\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_03\n The first one is we have to judge the...\n\n0:09:00\tSPEAKER_01\n If it is fancy, you can feel.\n\n0:09:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's say it is a pineapple.\n\n0:09:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Is the color acceptable?\n\n0:09:09\tSPEAKER_03\n No, the color is fine.\n\n0:09:12\tSPEAKER_02\n There is too much red.\n\n0:09:15\tSPEAKER_01\n It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top.\n\n0:09:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:09:24\tSPEAKER_03\n From 1 to 7.\n\n0:09:27\tSPEAKER_01\n 7 is the maximum.\n\n0:09:30\tSPEAKER_03\n 7 is the fourth and 1 is the second.\n\n0:09:34\tSPEAKER_02\n I will give 2 or 3.\n\n0:09:37\tSPEAKER_02\n 3, I will say 3.\n\n0:09:40\tNone\n 3?\n\n0:09:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Is it better?\n\n0:09:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Then let me...\n\n0:09:48\tSPEAKER_03\n What other criterion is...\n\n0:09:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Is it used technologically?\n\n0:09:55\tSPEAKER_01\n In a very...\n\n0:09:58\tSPEAKER_01\n There is a microphone inside.\n\n0:10:01\tSPEAKER_02\n This is microphone re.\n\n0:10:04\tSPEAKER_01\n It is a microphone.\n\n0:10:07\tSPEAKER_01\n There is a technology inside that we can't recognize.\n\n0:10:12\tSPEAKER_01\n You can turn it.\n\n0:10:15\tSPEAKER_01\n You can't recognize it.\n\n0:10:18\tSPEAKER_03\n You can't recognize it.\n\n0:10:21\tSPEAKER_03\n When you say technologically, it is more...\n\n0:10:25\tSPEAKER_01\n We have tactile buttons.\n\n0:10:29\tSPEAKER_02\n You have microphone in where you have...\n\n0:10:32\tSPEAKER_02\n That's good.\n\n0:10:34\tSPEAKER_02\n This solar receptor...\n\n0:10:37\tSPEAKER_03\n That is a good point.\n\n0:10:40\tSPEAKER_02\n I think technologically it is acceptable.\n\n0:10:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe 2?\n\n0:10:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Using the same scale.\n\n0:10:48\tSPEAKER_02\n You agree?\n\n0:10:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe the most critical one.\n\n0:10:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Last one I would like to judge is...\n\n0:10:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Is it easy to use?\n\n0:11:02\tSPEAKER_02\n The local command yes.\n\n0:11:04\tSPEAKER_02\n It might be easy.\n\n0:11:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Is this very easy?\n\n0:11:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Can you just explain me the...\n\n0:11:11\tSPEAKER_02\n This is the base.\n\n0:11:14\tSPEAKER_02\n So you can turn to change the channel.\n\n0:11:18\tSPEAKER_03\n How intuitive is it to turn things to change channels?\n\n0:11:22\tSPEAKER_03\n I think maybe if you want to go from...\n\n0:11:25\tSPEAKER_01\n If you have some play...\n\n0:11:28\tSPEAKER_01\n You can turn like that to change the channel.\n\n0:11:32\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it is quite easy to do zapping.\n\n0:11:35\tSPEAKER_01\n But maybe it will be too fast.\n\n0:11:38\tSPEAKER_03\n I am not convinced it is the best way to jump from 1 to 20.\n\n0:11:45\tSPEAKER_03\n How can you go directly to 20?\n\n0:11:49\tSPEAKER_02\n No, no.\n\n0:11:52\tSPEAKER_02\n It depends on the angle.\n\n0:11:55\tSPEAKER_02\n You can turn it.\n\n0:11:58\tSPEAKER_02\n You need to turn it from 2.\n\n0:12:01\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it is 3, 4, 10, 5.\n\n0:12:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Just imagine you have 50 channels.\n\n0:12:09\tSPEAKER_02\n You can turn it from 3 to 30.\n\n0:12:15\tSPEAKER_02\n How many do you have?\n\n0:12:18\tSPEAKER_01\n But you have to go through all the channels.\n\n0:12:21\tSPEAKER_02\n I think you have a scale.\n\n0:12:24\tSPEAKER_02\n When you stop the tone...\n\n0:12:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Then the angle you stop is the angle.\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_03\n It is the channel.\n\n0:12:35\tSPEAKER_03\n How do you know this angle is the correct one?\n\n0:12:38\tSPEAKER_02\n It is very easy because you know how many channels are there.\n\n0:12:42\tSPEAKER_03\n So you count at a 1 degree to 2 degrees?\n\n0:12:45\tSPEAKER_02\n No, you can do it.\n\n0:12:47\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't think so.\n\n0:12:50\tSPEAKER_02\n I think so.\n\n0:12:53\tSPEAKER_02\n I think so.\n\n0:12:56\tSPEAKER_02\n The vocal command is easy to do.\n\n0:12:59\tSPEAKER_03\n We have said previously that maybe it is not going to be...\n\n0:13:03\tSPEAKER_01\n When you are zapping, you are changing from 1 channel to the other.\n\n0:13:07\tSPEAKER_01\n So you are passing through all the channels.\n\n0:13:10\tSPEAKER_01\n So when you say I want to go to channel number 20, you have decided to go to channel 20.\n\n0:13:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Because you really want to go on this channel.\n\n0:13:19\tSPEAKER_01\n This will be more for browsing.\n\n0:13:21\tSPEAKER_01\n You don't really know what you want to do.\n\n0:13:23\tSPEAKER_01\n You can turn it.\n\n0:13:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting.\n\n0:13:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Seems to be good.\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Good choice Mr. David Jordan.\n\n0:13:35\tSPEAKER_01\n You famous with other...\n\n0:13:38\tSPEAKER_02\n You can't do this.\n\n0:13:41\tSPEAKER_02\n You can turn it.\n\n0:13:46\tSPEAKER_02\n If you want to skip from channel 1 to channel 2, you skip this.\n\n0:13:51\tSPEAKER_02\n If you want to skip from channel 1 to channel 10, you turn this.\n\n0:13:54\tSPEAKER_02\n It's like fine from cost to fine.\n\n0:13:57\tSPEAKER_02\n This is fine.\n\n0:13:59\tSPEAKER_02\n It costs to fine.\n\n0:14:02\tSPEAKER_02\n This looks better.\n\n0:14:05\tSPEAKER_02\n This is from one channel to another channel.\n\n0:14:08\tSPEAKER_02\n You have the vocal comment.\n\n0:14:13\tSPEAKER_02\n On off.\n\n0:14:15\tSPEAKER_03\n It has to be on to...\n\n0:14:18\tSPEAKER_01\n It's also time you add them.\n\n0:14:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Sleeping remote control.\n\n0:14:23\tSPEAKER_03\n That's not the ecological.\n\n0:14:26\tSPEAKER_01\n That's why we have the solar.\n\n0:14:29\tSPEAKER_02\n To come back to the computer.\n\n0:14:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Which number?\n\n0:14:34\tSPEAKER_02\n It's very relative but it's fine.\n\n0:14:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you agree?\n\n0:14:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:14:41\tSPEAKER_02\n So the reason about this 4 is 1.\n\n0:14:44\tSPEAKER_02\n It's 3 for me.\n\n0:14:47\tSPEAKER_02\n So...\n\n0:14:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives.\n\n0:14:53\tSPEAKER_01\n What's your opinion?\n\n0:14:55\tSPEAKER_03\n We didn't say...\n\n0:14:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Those are sort of agree but this one would be more 5 to me.\n\n0:15:00\tSPEAKER_03\n 5?\n\n0:15:01\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean this is just a prototype.\n\n0:15:04\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm not really convinced it's so easy to use.\n\n0:15:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe what you compare with traditional controller.\n\n0:15:15\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's easier than traditional controller.\n\n0:15:18\tSPEAKER_02\n If you use traditional controller, you have to put the button.\n\n0:15:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Now you don't have to put the button.\n\n0:15:24\tSPEAKER_02\n You have to just pin the...\n\n0:15:26\tSPEAKER_02\n You can't control the skill.\n\n0:15:29\tSPEAKER_02\n How can you control the skill?\n\n0:15:32\tSPEAKER_02\n By pushing 0 with the 1st one.\n\n0:15:35\tSPEAKER_02\n And 1.\n\n0:15:36\tSPEAKER_02\n You can do it.\n\n0:15:38\tSPEAKER_02\n But you can also do it in the...\n\n0:15:40\tSPEAKER_02\n If you do not want to browse the channel, you can just...\n\n0:15:44\tSPEAKER_02\n There's also a button here.\n\n0:15:46\tSPEAKER_02\n There's some versions.\n\n0:15:47\tSPEAKER_02\n This function is just for your browsing.\n\n0:15:50\tSPEAKER_02\n From one channel to the next one.\n\n0:15:53\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not just a previously previously.\n\n0:15:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Changing your mind.\n\n0:15:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Find to course.\n\n0:16:02\tSPEAKER_01\n From 10 to 10 channel.\n\n0:16:05\tSPEAKER_02\n 10 to 10 to 10 to 20.\n\n0:16:08\tSPEAKER_02\n And this one 1 to 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\n0:16:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Like this.\n\n0:16:13\tSPEAKER_02\n There's different skill.\n\n0:16:15\tSPEAKER_02\n So you can choose.\n\n0:16:17\tSPEAKER_03\n This has to stay on the table.\n\n0:16:20\tSPEAKER_03\n This has to stay on the table.\n\n0:16:25\tSPEAKER_02\n In fact, on a flat plate.\n\n0:16:27\tSPEAKER_02\n This is just a bit.\n\n0:16:29\tSPEAKER_03\n You can...\n\n0:16:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, then when you turn it...\n\n0:16:34\tSPEAKER_01\n No, no.\n\n0:16:36\tSPEAKER_01\n You can't put it out.\n\n0:16:38\tSPEAKER_01\n It's just your turning from the base.\n\n0:16:40\tSPEAKER_01\n You need to have everything in hand.\n\n0:16:42\tSPEAKER_03\n If you want to turn, you can't use it and turn.\n\n0:16:45\tSPEAKER_03\n You need to put it on.\n\n0:16:47\tSPEAKER_01\n That's the weak point.\n\n0:16:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Because with the traditional one, you just have one hand.\n\n0:16:52\tSPEAKER_01\n And say, I've lost the remote control.\n\n0:16:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Nobody would take it.\n\n0:16:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, you would never lose it from there.\n\n0:17:00\tSPEAKER_02\n This is the next generation.\n\n0:17:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe.\n\n0:17:07\tSPEAKER_02\n It's the next prototype.\n\n0:17:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe we can change from...\n\n0:17:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe for it.\n\n0:17:13\tSPEAKER_01\n For it.\n\n0:17:14\tSPEAKER_01\n It's easy to use for.\n\n0:17:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, for it's more.\n\n0:17:17\tSPEAKER_03\n It's easier to...\n\n0:17:19\tSPEAKER_02\n I can't hear it with this.\n\n0:17:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, for it's more than ever.\n\n0:17:30\tSPEAKER_02\n So average.\n\n0:17:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Nine over three?\n\n0:17:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Three.\n\n0:17:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Three.\n\n0:17:36\tSPEAKER_02\n It's average, eight, seven, eight.\n\n0:17:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, so...\n\n0:17:40\tSPEAKER_02\n It needs maybe some further work.\n\n0:17:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, especially on the easy to use.\n\n0:17:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Target.\n\n0:17:47\tSPEAKER_01\n So the project is accepted?\n\n0:17:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:52\tSPEAKER_01\n But I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple.\n\n0:18:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:03\tSPEAKER_01\n If you really want to have a fruitful remote control.\n\n0:18:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:18:14\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:18:16\tSPEAKER_01\n So final.\n\n0:18:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, we had a prototype presentation with the evaluation.\n\n0:18:24\tSPEAKER_01\n So as we all agree to accept...\n\n0:18:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Under certain conditions, the prototype will have looked to the final...\n\n0:18:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Financial view.\n\n0:18:40\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:18:42\tSPEAKER_01\n We need to calculate their projection cost.\n\n0:18:46\tSPEAKER_01\n As I said in the first meeting, when to have a remote control, that would cost more than 12 and more than 50 euros.\n\n0:18:55\tSPEAKER_01\n And if it's not the case, you would have to redesign it.\n\n0:19:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:19:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:02\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:19:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Just have a look at the...\n\n0:19:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, here is the...\n\n0:19:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Excel...\n\n0:19:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Shit.\n\n0:19:12\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:19:15\tSPEAKER_01\n So as the energy source, we have Han Dinamo.\n\n0:19:20\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:19:21\tSPEAKER_01\n We don't use that.\n\n0:19:23\tSPEAKER_01\n We have battery, right?\n\n0:19:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:25\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm literally...\n\n0:19:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Kinetic.\n\n0:19:27\tSPEAKER_01\n We don't have it.\n\n0:19:28\tSPEAKER_01\n I suppose.\n\n0:19:29\tSPEAKER_01\n But we have solar cells.\n\n0:19:30\tSPEAKER_01\n How many do you need solar cells?\n\n0:19:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Do you think one would be enough for them?\n\n0:19:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Such as...\n\n0:19:36\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's number of branches.\n\n0:19:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Three.\n\n0:19:40\tSPEAKER_02\n It's very solar cells.\n\n0:19:42\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:19:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Electronic.\n\n0:19:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Single chip and print.\n\n0:19:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Just one would be necessary.\n\n0:19:49\tSPEAKER_02\n One?\n\n0:19:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Zero for the others.\n\n0:19:53\tSPEAKER_01\n And sample sensors and pull speaker.\n\n0:19:58\tSPEAKER_03\n One.\n\n0:20:00\tSPEAKER_02\n As we have voice recognition, I think.\n\n0:20:04\tSPEAKER_01\n So the case...\n\n0:20:06\tSPEAKER_02\n It will be...\n\n0:20:08\tSPEAKER_03\n So we are already 19.\n\n0:20:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Wooden?\n\n0:20:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:20:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Just...\n\n0:20:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Keep on going.\n\n0:20:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Just have an idea.\n\n0:20:18\tSPEAKER_02\n It's yes, the wooden...\n\n0:20:20\tSPEAKER_02\n There's no wood.\n\n0:20:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Plastic, just on the...\n\n0:20:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but what about case?\n\n0:20:24\tSPEAKER_01\n An curved, flat, single curved, double curved.\n\n0:20:27\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's more like double curved.\n\n0:20:28\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not going to be double curved.\n\n0:20:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, double curved.\n\n0:20:30\tSPEAKER_01\n One?\n\n0:20:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Wood?\n\n0:20:40\tSPEAKER_02\n But this is...\n\n0:20:41\tSPEAKER_02\n A rubber...\n\n0:20:42\tSPEAKER_01\n No, no.\n\n0:20:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Do we need special color?\n\n0:20:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe two?\n\n0:20:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, we have two special colors.\n\n0:20:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Push button.\n\n0:20:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, we have four.\n\n0:20:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Five?\n\n0:20:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Five?\n\n0:20:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:20:58\tNone\n Scrawl wheel?\n\n0:21:00\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:21:02\tSPEAKER_01\n It's more like integrated...\n\n0:21:04\tSPEAKER_01\n I think this will be like a squirrel.\n\n0:21:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it will.\n\n0:21:08\tSPEAKER_02\n You turn it.\n\n0:21:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe two squirrel wheel as well.\n\n0:21:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, true.\n\n0:21:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Of course, to find a squirrel wheel.\n\n0:21:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:21:19\tSPEAKER_01\n So no button supplements?\n\n0:21:22\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:21:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:21:25\tSPEAKER_03\n I think we have problem.\n\n0:21:28\tSPEAKER_01\n L.C. display, maybe?\n\n0:21:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Into phrase.\n\n0:21:31\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we...\n\n0:21:32\tSPEAKER_01\n If we keep on adding things...\n\n0:21:34\tSPEAKER_01\n It's okay.\n\n0:21:35\tSPEAKER_01\n That's fine.\n\n0:21:36\tSPEAKER_01\n So we have to...\n\n0:21:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, one of the key points is solar cells.\n\n0:21:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe if...\n\n0:21:42\tSPEAKER_01\n If suppose if we change, you know, we could put just one.\n\n0:21:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:47\tNone\n Has it changed?\n\n0:21:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, it was changed.\n\n0:21:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, it did change.\n\n0:21:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, it was changed.\n\n0:21:55\tSPEAKER_03\n It did change.\n\n0:21:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:21:57\tSPEAKER_02\n We have to select electronics to from...\n\n0:21:59\tSPEAKER_02\n From the sample sensor to regular tip.\n\n0:22:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh.\n\n0:22:04\tSPEAKER_02\n We have to delete the sample sensor.\n\n0:22:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but we have the voice recognition.\n\n0:22:11\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:22:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but this one, one of the feature we were...\n\n0:22:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it's a one...\n\n0:22:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe we have two words.\n\n0:22:19\tSPEAKER_02\n It's the first part in the basic one.\n\n0:22:21\tSPEAKER_02\n It's the word into plastic, maybe.\n\n0:22:23\tSPEAKER_01\n It seems that this can be...\n\n0:22:24\tSPEAKER_02\n It would be better.\n\n0:22:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, word into plastic.\n\n0:22:27\tSPEAKER_02\n It should be fine.\n\n0:22:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Plastic is free.\n\n0:22:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:36\tSPEAKER_01\n So do we need special color?\n\n0:22:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that's one of...\n\n0:22:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Because we have red.\n\n0:22:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, right.\n\n0:22:41\tSPEAKER_01\n And yellow.\n\n0:22:42\tSPEAKER_03\n We could turn everything in either yellow or black.\n\n0:22:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Black then is a regular color.\n\n0:22:49\tSPEAKER_01\n I think so we need...\n\n0:22:51\tSPEAKER_01\n If we try to have a kind of pineapple bee.\n\n0:22:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:22:56\tSPEAKER_03\n So push button then it's the next...\n\n0:22:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:00\tSPEAKER_01\n And we have integrated scroll wheel with push button.\n\n0:23:03\tSPEAKER_01\n No, I think this is one.\n\n0:23:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Integrated scroll wheel push button.\n\n0:23:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it is fine.\n\n0:23:07\tSPEAKER_01\n So we have only one.\n\n0:23:10\tSPEAKER_01\n And...\n\n0:23:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Push button.\n\n0:23:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Close to.\n\n0:23:14\tSPEAKER_01\n So if we have all integrated in the scroll wheel and push button, it's...\n\n0:23:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, remove maybe...\n\n0:23:22\tSPEAKER_02\n You have five push buttons so we can just...\n\n0:23:25\tSPEAKER_02\n You know, try to modify some of them to have...\n\n0:23:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, so what's the...\n\n0:23:34\tSPEAKER_03\n What a leg.\n\n0:23:36\tSPEAKER_02\n How about between the other two?\n\n0:23:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Double curb.\n\n0:23:39\tSPEAKER_02\n We can transform the double curb into...\n\n0:23:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Something flat.\n\n0:23:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but flat.\n\n0:23:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Uncurved.\n\n0:23:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, maybe not.\n\n0:23:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Single curb better.\n\n0:23:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Single curb is fine.\n\n0:23:58\tSPEAKER_00\n We have only one ure left.\n\n0:24:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe don't, but no battery only so myself.\n\n0:24:10\tSPEAKER_01\n I think somebody gets...\n\n0:24:12\tSPEAKER_03\n I think there's a problem with the push button.\n\n0:24:16\tSPEAKER_01\n We only need...\n\n0:24:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Just one.\n\n0:24:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Push, just one.\n\n0:24:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:24\tSPEAKER_00\n That's fine.\n\n0:24:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, actually...\n\n0:24:28\tSPEAKER_03\n So we have one button.\n\n0:24:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, we have one button.\n\n0:24:32\tSPEAKER_01\n And...\n\n0:24:34\tSPEAKER_02\n One scroll wheel.\n\n0:24:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Scroll wheel with push button on it.\n\n0:24:38\tSPEAKER_02\n And the vocal command, it's fine.\n\n0:24:40\tSPEAKER_03\n It's good they're not charging anything for them.\n\n0:24:44\tSPEAKER_01\n So yeah, I think we've done a good job as the cost is...\n\n0:24:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Could we have...\n\n0:24:52\tSPEAKER_02\n 12 or 15?\n\n0:24:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, actually it's wrong.\n\n0:24:56\tSPEAKER_03\n We are not under 12.\n\n0:24:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but it's under or equal.\n\n0:25:00\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not written.\n\n0:25:02\tSPEAKER_02\n It's under or equal.\n\n0:25:04\tSPEAKER_02\n It's fine.\n\n0:25:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, so let's see...\n\n0:25:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it's fine, right?\n\n0:25:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Which part is the most depends in part?\n\n0:25:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Solar cells.\n\n0:25:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Solar cells.\n\n0:25:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I think so too.\n\n0:25:18\tSPEAKER_01\n I think, yeah.\n\n0:25:20\tSPEAKER_01\n But it would be interesting for our marketing team to make...\n\n0:25:24\tSPEAKER_01\n To be able to sell these things.\n\n0:25:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Advertisement when turning the solar cells to be cheaper.\n\n0:25:28\tSPEAKER_03\n That's nice argument, but...\n\n0:25:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it's nice.\n\n0:25:32\tSPEAKER_02\n It's still...\n\n0:25:34\tSPEAKER_02\n It's very, very, very expensive.\n\n0:25:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe...\n\n0:25:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but it would be technologically innovative, so...\n\n0:25:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but we just have one button.\n\n0:25:44\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's easy to use in powerful...\n\n0:25:48\tSPEAKER_01\n As the remote control has only one button.\n\n0:25:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Easy, I don't know about powerful.\n\n0:25:56\tSPEAKER_02\n It's easy, it's very easy to use the phone.\n\n0:26:00\tSPEAKER_01\n So I don't think we need to redesign the product.\n\n0:26:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, that's what we've just done.\n\n0:26:10\tSPEAKER_03\n You've done it, it's under the...\n\n0:26:12\tSPEAKER_02\n If it was low, higher, so...\n\n0:26:16\tSPEAKER_03\n So...\n\n0:26:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:26:20\tSPEAKER_03\n So...\n\n0:26:22\tSPEAKER_02\n So what are we going to do with this project evaluation?\n\n0:26:26\tSPEAKER_02\n So...\n\n0:26:28\tSPEAKER_03\n We have to discuss it.\n\n0:26:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:26:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:26:34\tSPEAKER_01\n So did you enjoy your clay modeling?\n\n0:26:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:26:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Of course.\n\n0:26:40\tSPEAKER_01\n This is my job.\n\n0:26:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Was it a nice way to create your remote control?\n\n0:26:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:46\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a...\n\n0:26:48\tSPEAKER_02\n It's good to...\n\n0:26:50\tSPEAKER_02\n To create a control instead of a computer.\n\n0:26:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I think I found it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process from the beginning to the end and designing, looking at the chips, the solar cells, and...\n\n0:27:08\tSPEAKER_02\n It was very informative for me.\n\n0:27:12\tSPEAKER_01\n And for the marketing guy?\n\n0:27:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, that was good, but we should have more brainstorming like meetings, maybe.\n\n0:27:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Because we're just presenting one is presenting his stuff.\n\n0:27:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Next one is his stuff.\n\n0:27:26\tSPEAKER_03\n And then we try to combine afterwards.\n\n0:27:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:27:30\tSPEAKER_01\n And new ideas about new products, maybe, which would be fashion and...\n\n0:27:40\tSPEAKER_01\n And yellow?\n\n0:27:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Yellow.\n\n0:27:44\tSPEAKER_02\n I think you can think about yellow TV now.\n\n0:27:46\tSPEAKER_02\n After a food TV or I don't know.\n\n0:27:48\tSPEAKER_02\n I can be interesting.\n\n0:27:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, just a lemon.\n\n0:27:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, a lemon TV.\n\n0:27:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Yellow lemon.\n\n0:27:56\tSPEAKER_02\n You know the traditional TV is flat.\n\n0:27:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it's flat.\n\n0:28:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Squared.\n\n0:28:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, the shape is very boring.\n\n0:28:04\tSPEAKER_02\n It's really boring.\n\n0:28:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Come up with new TV.\n\n0:28:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Such as this kind of TV.\n\n0:28:10\tSPEAKER_02\n So you can...\n\n0:28:12\tSPEAKER_01\n You have bass.\n\n0:28:14\tSPEAKER_01\n The lemon TV with the pineapple remote control.\n\n0:28:16\tSPEAKER_02\n That's really interesting.\n\n0:28:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, because the TV...\n\n0:28:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, that's interesting.\n\n0:28:22\tSPEAKER_01\n We could do a kind of fruit collection of...\n\n0:28:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Electronica things.\n\n0:28:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Electronica device.\n\n0:28:28\tSPEAKER_03\n We just don't trust too much the...\n\n0:28:30\tSPEAKER_03\n The fruits.\n\n0:28:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe.\n\n0:28:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Because fruits and vegetables you won't last for 10 years.\n\n0:28:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe it will be insects.\n\n0:28:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but I think it's good to follow the flow and you know make it now and after you know...\n\n0:28:42\tSPEAKER_02\n If the people change their mind you change it.\n\n0:28:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but this is good because it's not a long...\n\n0:28:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Long life product.\n\n0:28:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:52\tSPEAKER_03\n TV is more like 15 years maybe.\n\n0:28:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, that's a lemon TV for...\n\n0:28:56\tSPEAKER_02\n We can think about TV with you know where you can change you know the aspect.\n\n0:29:00\tSPEAKER_02\n So like for the cell phones.\n\n0:29:02\tSPEAKER_01\n You customize it every time.\n\n0:29:04\tSPEAKER_02\n So every time you go change just change the appearance.\n\n0:29:08\tSPEAKER_02\n You can't lose it in mind.\n\n0:29:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, and keep the rubber up here.\n\n0:29:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, and following the mood of person, the fish and so on.\n\n0:29:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:18\tSPEAKER_01\n It's interesting maybe we can create a line of TV.\n\n0:29:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, TV for autumn and a TV for winter you know.\n\n0:29:28\tSPEAKER_02\n So what is it?\n\n0:29:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:29:32\tNone\n So I think the costs are within the...\n\n0:29:34\tSPEAKER_02\n We're just...\n\n0:29:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, the purchase is really...\n\n0:29:38\tSPEAKER_01\n 12.50 euros.\n\n0:29:44\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:29:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Do you think you can celebrate your creation?\n\n0:29:48\tSPEAKER_01\n You can celebrate your leadership.\n\n0:29:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh thanks a lot.\n\n0:29:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Thank you.\n\n0:29:54\tSPEAKER_02\n But I said it's David Jordan.\n\n0:29:56\tSPEAKER_02\n It's really a celebrating...\n\n0:29:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it's a very nice day.\n\n0:30:00\tSPEAKER_01\n It's the very happy...\n\n0:30:02\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a very...\n\n0:30:04\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a very happy show.\n\n0:30:06\tSPEAKER_02\n It's party...\n\n0:30:08\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a very emotional...\n\n0:30:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:12\tSPEAKER_01\n The thing now is to...\n\n0:30:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it's your job.\n\n0:30:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:18\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a good and good look show.\n\n0:30:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, and the...\n\n0:30:26\tSPEAKER_02\n 12.50...\n\n0:30:28\tSPEAKER_02\n 25 euros.\n\n0:30:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I think it's...\n\n0:30:32\tSPEAKER_02\n 25 euros.\n\n0:30:34\tSPEAKER_00\n It's really pretty expensive.\n\n0:30:36\tSPEAKER_00\n No, it's not so...\n\n0:30:38\tSPEAKER_03\n It should be nice.\n\n0:30:40\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm not so happy about the fruit shape you know.\n\n0:30:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Really?\n\n0:30:44\tSPEAKER_02\n It should be fine you know actually.\n\n0:30:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe you can do a test, put it outside and you can be scum.\n\n0:30:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Really fruit.\n\n0:31:02\tSPEAKER_00\n I think I like...\n\n0:31:04\tSPEAKER_02\n The color I'm working.\n\n0:31:06\tSPEAKER_03\n No, the color is perfect.\n\n0:31:08\tSPEAKER_03\n It's perfect and...\n\n0:31:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, nothing is...\n\n0:31:12\tSPEAKER_01\n The logo is missing still.\n\n0:31:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but the color...\n\n0:31:16\tSPEAKER_01\n The yellow one...\n\n0:31:18\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for remote control.\n\n0:31:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Still, that was one of the requirements we had.\n\n0:31:26\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't think it's such a problem.\n\n0:31:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Just putting it all over somewhere.\n\n0:31:30\tSPEAKER_01\n We decided to have something yellow and red for the costs.\n\n0:31:34\tSPEAKER_01\n So maybe we can just integrate it on one side.\n\n0:31:38\tSPEAKER_01\n The double R.\n\n0:31:40\tSPEAKER_02\n That's a really good idea.\n\n0:31:42\tSPEAKER_01\n So we have logo, we have the color, and we have the fashion in electronics.\n\n0:31:48\tSPEAKER_01\n So we have the GIMA.\n\n0:31:50\tSPEAKER_02\n GIMA, give it a cute name.\n\n0:31:52\tSPEAKER_02\n A cute name?\n\n0:31:54\tSPEAKER_01\n No, it's the pineapple control.\n\n0:31:56\tSPEAKER_01\n You cannot say the pineapple control.\n\n0:31:58\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not the pineapple now.\n\n0:32:00\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a pineapple control.\n\n0:32:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Pineapple.\n\n0:32:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Pineapple remote control.\n\n0:32:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, just flying so.\n\n0:32:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's carry on top.\n\n0:32:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's say flying so.\n\n0:32:12\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a pineapple control.\n\n0:32:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Pineapple remote control.\n\n0:32:18\tSPEAKER_02\n I say it's fine.\n\n0:32:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Would you buy one?\n\n0:32:22\tSPEAKER_01\n I tried to.\n\n0:32:24\tSPEAKER_02\n 25.\n\n0:32:26\tSPEAKER_02\n I can't, I would try it working so.\n\n0:32:28\tSPEAKER_02\n See how easy it is.\n\n0:32:30\tSPEAKER_02\n You lost your control.\n\n0:32:32\tSPEAKER_02\n I already saw it.\n\n0:32:34\tSPEAKER_02\n To need buy one.\n\n0:32:36\tSPEAKER_02\n If it is a universal one, I can use it.\n\n0:32:38\tSPEAKER_01\n One thing I like is the shape.\n\n0:32:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Because it's not like the remote controls.\n\n0:32:44\tSPEAKER_01\n You can put it in your pocket or in your jacket.\n\n0:32:46\tSPEAKER_02\n That's why, what do you choose?\n\n0:32:48\tSPEAKER_02\n I prefer the laser remote control.\n\n0:32:52\tSPEAKER_02\n What do you choose?\n\n0:32:56\tSPEAKER_02\n I think I will choose this one because of the color.\n\n0:32:58\tSPEAKER_02\n It's okay.\n\n0:33:00\tSPEAKER_02\n It will light your house and your TV.\n\n0:33:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:33:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe next if we decide to do something, we put light inside.\n\n0:33:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:33:10\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:33:12\tSPEAKER_03\n We have some problems.\n\n0:33:14\tSPEAKER_01\n It would be interesting to just see if people will buy this one and maybe add some features to it.\n\n0:33:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, after we do it.\n\n0:33:24\tSPEAKER_03\n If it's a new trend.\n\n0:33:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:33:30\tSPEAKER_02\n That's why.\n\n0:33:32\tSPEAKER_02\n We can't tell it right now.\n\n0:33:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, new product.\n\n0:33:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Champagne, see?\n\n0:33:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Mr. Baba.\n\n0:33:40\tSPEAKER_02\n It's fine.\n\n0:33:42\tSPEAKER_02\n So, bye bye.\n\n0:33:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Next time.\n\n0:33:46\tSPEAKER_02\n I would buy one.\n\n0:33:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:50\tSPEAKER_01\n So.\n\n0:33:52\tNone\n That's quite good.\n\n0:33:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:34:00\tSPEAKER_01\n I will close this.\n\n0:34:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:04\tNone\n Go.\n\n0:34:06\tSPEAKER_01\n So, I think we have finished.\n\n0:34:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:34:10\tSPEAKER_01\n So, we are designing in the evaluation of our remote control.\n\n0:34:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:34:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:18\tSPEAKER_01\n And we have a nearly final product.\n\n0:34:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, a final product.\n\n0:34:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Final product.\n\n0:34:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:26\tSPEAKER_01\n So, thank you very much.\n\n0:34:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Very productive.\n\n0:34:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:34:42\tSPEAKER_02\n So, please don't keep it.\n\n0:34:44\tSPEAKER_02\n You might pop it out.\n\n0:34:46\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:48\tNone\n That's not the nice thing.\n\n0:34:50\tNone\n Thank you.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "SPEAKER and Ja.
