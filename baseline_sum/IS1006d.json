Okay.\n\n0:00:24\tSPEAKER_00\n So my Christa, it's the Heisameen.\n\n0:00:39\tSPEAKER_00\n It's the detail design meeting, so we're going last meeting.\n\n0:00:48\tSPEAKER_00\n So first, Marc and Rama are going to present the prototype.\n\n0:00:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Then Samuel will propose some criteria to evaluate this prototype.\n\n0:01:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Then we...\n\n0:01:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:01:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:01:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Then we're going to do some findings to see if it is feasible.\n\n0:01:17\tSPEAKER_00\n And at the end we will evaluate ourselves as a team.\n\n0:01:26\tSPEAKER_00\n So first let's see the prototype.\n\n0:01:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Here we have our prototype model.\n\n0:01:35\tSPEAKER_00\n And you have some slides.\n\n0:01:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes, some slides.\n\n0:01:38\tSPEAKER_06\n So in which...\n\n0:01:52\tSPEAKER_06\n So this is our remote control.\n\n0:01:57\tSPEAKER_06\n It's a working prototype.\n\n0:01:59\tSPEAKER_06\n You can use it now by switching all these buttons.\n\n0:02:03\tSPEAKER_06\n So first I present as we came to this perfect model and then we'll give some technical specifications.\n\n0:02:11\tSPEAKER_06\n That's...\n\n0:02:12\tSPEAKER_06\n Well, so let's start.\n\n0:02:14\tSPEAKER_06\n Please next slide.\n\n0:02:16\tSPEAKER_06\n We analyzed all the fruits and contacted NASA and made some real good...\n\n0:02:25\tSPEAKER_06\n Yeah, if you can see this and the stars are showing that we didn't write.\n\n0:02:31\tSPEAKER_06\n And society will accept it.\n\n0:02:36\tSPEAKER_06\n For sure.\n\n0:02:40\tSPEAKER_06\n And making some analysis of different fruits, we choose the ultimate four, ultimate colors and ultimate smell of it.\n\n0:02:49\tSPEAKER_06\n Please next slide.\n\n0:02:53\tSPEAKER_06\n But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea.\n\n0:02:57\tSPEAKER_06\n Because it's the most of the model, the ever-moder material we can select.\n\n0:03:07\tSPEAKER_06\n And it's practical.\n\n0:03:10\tSPEAKER_06\n And it still suits for our needs.\n\n0:03:11\tSPEAKER_06\n So please press something.\n\n0:03:14\tSPEAKER_06\n And as I said...\n\n0:03:15\tSPEAKER_06\n It's great.\n\n0:03:17\tSPEAKER_00\n It's great.\n\n0:03:19\tSPEAKER_06\n It's great.\n\n0:03:21\tSPEAKER_06\n Everyone is really, really glad to obtain such a device.\n\n0:03:32\tSPEAKER_06\n So you can touch it with your own hands.\n\n0:03:34\tSPEAKER_04\n Can I?\n\n0:03:35\tSPEAKER_06\n Sure.\n\n0:03:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:03:37\tSPEAKER_00\n What do you say?\n\n0:03:39\tSPEAKER_04\n It says...\n\n0:03:40\tSPEAKER_04\n I'll say.\n\n0:03:41\tSPEAKER_05\n Spodgy.\n\n0:03:42\tSPEAKER_05\n I'll buy it.\n\n0:03:44\tSPEAKER_05\n One day if I need to.\n\n0:03:48\tSPEAKER_05\n Hopefully my daughter will like it.\n\n0:03:53\tSPEAKER_06\n Okay.\n\n0:03:54\tSPEAKER_06\n And we got the answer.\n\n0:03:56\tSPEAKER_06\n Yes, of course.\n\n0:03:57\tSPEAKER_05\n Of course.\n\n0:03:58\tSPEAKER_06\n Of course.\n\n0:03:59\tSPEAKER_06\n Please next slide.\n\n0:04:02\tSPEAKER_06\n This is the prototype you can have a look at it.\n\n0:04:05\tSPEAKER_06\n And that's all I wanted to say.\n\n0:04:08\tSPEAKER_06\n Now it's technical specification by our...\n\n0:04:12\tSPEAKER_06\n Colling.\n\n0:04:17\tSPEAKER_03\n So there's a button missing.\n\n0:04:21\tSPEAKER_03\n This is really flexible.\n\n0:04:23\tSPEAKER_02\n And you're watching the option.\n\n0:04:26\tSPEAKER_02\n So function.\n\n0:04:29\tSPEAKER_02\n So as we discussed, we have to switch on, switch off whenever we want.\n\n0:04:34\tSPEAKER_02\n And so we have buttons.\n\n0:04:37\tSPEAKER_02\n And using LCD or like you can use this jock wheel and select which option on LCD and then do on and off.\n\n0:04:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Then you will have volume control.\n\n0:04:49\tSPEAKER_02\n So you can press this button to increase or decrease your volume.\n\n0:04:56\tSPEAKER_02\n And we have some LCD controls.\n\n0:04:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Like switching the LCD display if you want to use LCD or you don't want you can just use normal button.\n\n0:05:06\tSPEAKER_02\n And we have speech recognition.\n\n0:05:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Here you have microphone and then it takes your voice and then it's trying to recognize and it converts into the action and location finder.\n\n0:05:20\tSPEAKER_02\n And we want to do the location basically using speech recognition.\n\n0:05:24\tSPEAKER_02\n You can just say very smart remote control or you can just give some nickname to your remote control.\n\n0:05:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Bob is Bob.\n\n0:05:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Bob.\n\n0:05:32\tSPEAKER_01\n And Bob.\n\n0:05:33\tSPEAKER_01\n It would say hi.\n\n0:05:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Hey Bob.\n\n0:05:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, hi and then you can use it.\n\n0:05:42\tSPEAKER_02\n So our team is now fruits mainly strawberry.\n\n0:05:47\tSPEAKER_02\n So you can have these are strawberries.\n\n0:05:51\tSPEAKER_02\n And then you can see the look LCD and all the switches.\n\n0:05:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Colorful.\n\n0:05:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Material.\n\n0:05:59\tSPEAKER_02\n We want to stick to Titanium.\n\n0:06:01\tSPEAKER_02\n And we want roots.\n\n0:06:03\tSPEAKER_05\n Belly, spark, we tighten.\n\n0:06:06\tSPEAKER_05\n I didn't know it exists but that's great.\n\n0:06:10\tSPEAKER_02\n So we want to have simple and perfect shapes.\n\n0:06:20\tSPEAKER_02\n The cache on this font.\n\n0:06:22\tSPEAKER_02\n You can have your own designs and you can feel simple designs.\n\n0:06:30\tSPEAKER_02\n And you can choose colors on your day for each day or even many colors.\n\n0:06:36\tSPEAKER_00\n That's for the city or for the Titanium.\n\n0:06:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, for the LCD.\n\n0:06:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, we have Titanium.\n\n0:06:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Titanium is still working on.\n\n0:06:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it's still working on.\n\n0:06:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Titanium.\n\n0:06:46\tSPEAKER_06\n Okay.\n\n0:06:47\tSPEAKER_06\n We'll start with the LCD.\n\n0:06:48\tSPEAKER_06\n You can ask Bob.\n\n0:06:49\tSPEAKER_06\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:50\tSPEAKER_06\n Just use this.\n\n0:06:51\tSPEAKER_01\n You have Bob, please.\n\n0:06:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Hey, you know you've been today.\n\n0:06:53\tSPEAKER_01\n You've been today.\n\n0:06:54\tSPEAKER_01\n You've been in big color.\n\n0:06:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, even you can configure your colors for each day depending on your mood or black.\n\n0:07:03\tSPEAKER_02\n You can have many colors.\n\n0:07:06\tSPEAKER_00\n And what are the strawberries for?\n\n0:07:09\tSPEAKER_00\n These are like sensors.\n\n0:07:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Of course.\n\n0:07:11\tSPEAKER_02\n What do you think?\n\n0:07:12\tSPEAKER_02\n That's what the strawberries are.\n\n0:07:13\tSPEAKER_02\n That's what the strawberries are.\n\n0:07:14\tSPEAKER_02\n That's what the strawberries are.\n\n0:07:15\tSPEAKER_04\n So after this meeting, you'll propose a party for our success for our shooting.\n\n0:07:19\tSPEAKER_04\n So if you are a vegetarian or you have any options, please let us know.\n\n0:07:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:07:25\tSPEAKER_02\n So after this meeting, you'll propose a party for our success for our shooting.\n\n0:07:33\tSPEAKER_02\n So if you are a vegetarian or you have any options, please let us know.\n\n0:07:40\tSPEAKER_06\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:41\tSPEAKER_06\n And we can just eat some strawberries.\n\n0:07:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:45\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:46\tSPEAKER_07\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:47\tSPEAKER_05\n Anything specific questions?\n\n0:07:50\tSPEAKER_00\n We'll see the financial party for all the time.\n\n0:07:57\tSPEAKER_06\n Let's make a party for us to make it.\n\n0:08:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Then we can discuss.\n\n0:08:04\tSPEAKER_00\n With the five, 50 millions, we first make a party.\n\n0:08:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Then we can have almost five million left.\n\n0:08:14\tSPEAKER_00\n What a design.\n\n0:08:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:08:16\tSPEAKER_00\n So.\n\n0:08:17\tSPEAKER_00\n It's my turn.\n\n0:08:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's see if it meets the evaluation criteria.\n\n0:08:23\tSPEAKER_05\n If you meet the evaluation criteria.\n\n0:08:30\tSPEAKER_07\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:32\tSPEAKER_05\n So evaluation, please.\n\n0:08:37\tSPEAKER_05\n So you made a very nice prototype and I think we now need all together to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it.\n\n0:08:49\tSPEAKER_05\n If it fulfills our what we want to do and things like that.\n\n0:08:54\tSPEAKER_05\n So next slide, please.\n\n0:08:59\tSPEAKER_05\n As you know, before going and creating and producing these strawberry remote control, it's very important to first verify if it makes sense, if we have a chance to sell it.\n\n0:09:15\tSPEAKER_05\n So we need to evaluate it and try to do it in a quantitative way as much as we can.\n\n0:09:22\tSPEAKER_05\n So what I propose is that we are going to have this scale from 1 to 7, one meaning that yes, it fulfills the criterion, whatever it is, and 7 meaning no, it doesn't fulfill at all.\n\n0:09:37\tSPEAKER_05\n And we're going to list all the criteria.\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_05\n I'm going to go to that next slide.\n\n0:09:42\tSPEAKER_05\n And together try to evaluate this according to this criterion from 1 to 7.\n\n0:09:47\tSPEAKER_05\n And then we're just going to have an average which will give us the value of our remote control.\n\n0:09:56\tSPEAKER_05\n So maybe we can have a look at the criteria.\n\n0:10:01\tSPEAKER_05\n So these are the criteria.\n\n0:10:04\tSPEAKER_05\n I thought were important.\n\n0:10:06\tSPEAKER_05\n Of course this can be discussed, but let's see.\n\n0:10:11\tSPEAKER_05\n So let's suppose we have fancy here and we have this scale from 1 to 7 with 4 in the middle.\n\n0:10:26\tSPEAKER_05\n So what do you think?\n\n0:10:31\tSPEAKER_05\n Is it fancy?\n\n0:10:33\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that fancy we can say it is fancy.\n\n0:10:36\tSPEAKER_05\n It is very, very fancy or have you ever seen something like that?\n\n0:10:41\tSPEAKER_00\n I am not the only one who is missing.\n\n0:10:44\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, of course.\n\n0:10:45\tSPEAKER_05\n What do you think?\n\n0:10:47\tSPEAKER_05\n It feels a bit.\n\n0:10:48\tSPEAKER_05\n No, wait is later.\n\n0:10:51\tSPEAKER_05\n No, wait.\n\n0:10:54\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, the fancy less now.\n\n0:10:55\tSPEAKER_05\n I think it's quite fancy.\n\n0:10:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, we can do it with 5 or 6.\n\n0:10:58\tSPEAKER_05\n No, it's 1.\n\n0:11:00\tSPEAKER_05\n It's another, yes.\n\n0:11:01\tSPEAKER_05\n One means it's a very fancy, 7 mean no.\n\n0:11:04\tSPEAKER_05\n So it's 1 or 2, but it's maybe 2.\n\n0:11:07\tSPEAKER_05\n So here, 2.\n\n0:11:10\tSPEAKER_05\n Then we have technology.\n\n0:11:16\tSPEAKER_05\n So what about technology?\n\n0:11:17\tSPEAKER_05\n We have speech recognition, we have location based.\n\n0:11:21\tSPEAKER_05\n We have a CD.\n\n0:11:23\tSPEAKER_05\n Change color.\n\n0:11:25\tSPEAKER_05\n Change color.\n\n0:11:27\tSPEAKER_05\n I think it's a one for that.\n\n0:11:31\tSPEAKER_05\n At least the one, yeah.\n\n0:11:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Rob business.\n\n0:11:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Till we need to.\n\n0:11:38\tSPEAKER_05\n So let's suppose my daughter take it and try it away.\n\n0:11:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again?\n\n0:11:47\tSPEAKER_05\n Maybe not the prototype.\n\n0:11:50\tSPEAKER_05\n Let's try.\n\n0:11:53\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh my god.\n\n0:11:55\tSPEAKER_05\n We just lost one trouble.\n\n0:11:58\tSPEAKER_05\n No, no.\n\n0:11:59\tSPEAKER_06\n But it all.\n\n0:12:02\tSPEAKER_06\n It's still working.\n\n0:12:03\tSPEAKER_06\n And your daughter got bonus.\n\n0:12:06\tSPEAKER_05\n It's a strawberry.\n\n0:12:07\tSPEAKER_05\n So it's not so bad.\n\n0:12:09\tSPEAKER_05\n I would say 3.\n\n0:12:11\tSPEAKER_05\n That makes sense, yeah.\n\n0:12:13\tSPEAKER_05\n Rob is.\n\n0:12:15\tSPEAKER_05\n Useful.\n\n0:12:17\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, so the question is, does it have the minimum requirement of a remote control?\n\n0:12:23\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't know.\n\n0:12:24\tSPEAKER_05\n These buttons are not clear, but you have at least a little bit of a screen.\n\n0:12:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Next.\n\n0:12:31\tSPEAKER_02\n What is the next choice?\n\n0:12:32\tSPEAKER_02\n This is volume control and channel change.\n\n0:12:34\tSPEAKER_00\n It depends on the main.\n\n0:12:36\tSPEAKER_00\n And you can do two sides.\n\n0:12:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:39\tSPEAKER_02\n And you can do on LCD using this.\n\n0:12:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Or scrolling all the option.\n\n0:12:45\tSPEAKER_05\n So before we go on the LCD, it's not touch control, touch screen.\n\n0:12:48\tSPEAKER_05\n You cannot go to channel 25.\n\n0:12:50\tSPEAKER_00\n You can by using the directly.\n\n0:12:53\tSPEAKER_06\n You go.\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_00\n So the basic board.\n\n0:12:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Push here.\n\n0:12:56\tSPEAKER_06\n So simple. Basic mode is you got just two buttons.\n\n0:12:59\tSPEAKER_06\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:00\tSPEAKER_06\n And the drug dial.\n\n0:13:01\tSPEAKER_06\n Oh, you can check this.\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_06\n You use this like volume up, volume down.\n\n0:13:05\tSPEAKER_06\n And if you go to the side.\n\n0:13:07\tSPEAKER_06\n It's channel up, channel down.\n\n0:13:09\tSPEAKER_06\n Okay.\n\n0:13:10\tSPEAKER_06\n And if you want to make just 25, you push on this.\n\n0:13:14\tSPEAKER_06\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:15\tSPEAKER_06\n You can select.\n\n0:13:16\tSPEAKER_06\n You select.\n\n0:13:17\tSPEAKER_06\n Five.\n\n0:13:18\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:13:19\tSPEAKER_05\n It's much longer than tapping to two five.\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_05\n No, don't you think so?\n\n0:13:25\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:13:26\tSPEAKER_05\n We can't go.\n\n0:13:27\tSPEAKER_05\n That's it.\n\n0:13:28\tSPEAKER_02\n You need to press.\n\n0:13:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Less than five.\n\n0:13:30\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:31\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_05\n But it's nice because people anyway don't go there.\n\n0:13:35\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:37\tSPEAKER_05\n So what do you think for it?\n\n0:13:39\tSPEAKER_05\n Useful.\n\n0:13:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Seems to be useful.\n\n0:13:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:42\tSPEAKER_02\n We need address.\n\n0:13:43\tSPEAKER_02\n We want to be only address two main functions here.\n\n0:13:45\tSPEAKER_02\n And the other functions will be on LCD.\n\n0:13:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Let me understand why.\n\n0:13:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Because I'm not sure.\n\n0:13:51\tSPEAKER_00\n That's for this one.\n\n0:13:52\tSPEAKER_00\n This one are two different different.\n\n0:13:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Up down or left?\n\n0:13:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:58\tSPEAKER_00\n And which, what is that?\n\n0:14:00\tSPEAKER_06\n The digital control.\n\n0:14:01\tSPEAKER_06\n The digital control in the cursor.\n\n0:14:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:14:04\tSPEAKER_02\n It's like selection of menus.\n\n0:14:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:14:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Similarly, like you will have blocks and you select which one.\n\n0:14:09\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:14:10\tSPEAKER_05\n I would say that the.\n\n0:14:11\tSPEAKER_00\n No, it looks useful.\n\n0:14:13\tSPEAKER_05\n Two or three.\n\n0:14:14\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:15\tSPEAKER_05\n Two or three.\n\n0:14:16\tSPEAKER_05\n Two.\n\n0:14:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:14:18\tSPEAKER_05\n So size and weight.\n\n0:14:22\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:23\tSPEAKER_05\n Is it the effective size and weight that is it real size, real weight?\n\n0:14:30\tSPEAKER_05\n Or is it sizes on almost sizes going to be that?\n\n0:14:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Because the weight will be a bit lighter because the state and the.\n\n0:14:40\tSPEAKER_06\n The 10ium, although it's going to be light.\n\n0:14:43\tSPEAKER_05\n It's going to be lighter because this seems to be very heavy.\n\n0:14:46\tSPEAKER_05\n I mean, from a daughter, for instance, yeah.\n\n0:14:49\tSPEAKER_05\n I'm not sure if she can use it.\n\n0:14:52\tSPEAKER_02\n But the state should be okay.\n\n0:14:55\tSPEAKER_05\n I'll put a tree for that because I haven't seen the weight.\n\n0:15:00\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:15:01\tSPEAKER_05\n That's not that color and shape.\n\n0:15:10\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, so color, it seems that we have the several colors for the LCD.\n\n0:15:14\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:15\tSPEAKER_05\n And it's not very clear what is the color of the.\n\n0:15:18\tSPEAKER_05\n The case.\n\n0:15:19\tSPEAKER_05\n The case is still.\n\n0:15:20\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, it's going to be tight on your.\n\n0:15:23\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, okay.\n\n0:15:24\tSPEAKER_05\n That's nice.\n\n0:15:25\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's good.\n\n0:15:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:15:27\tSPEAKER_00\n And what about the strawberries on the top?\n\n0:15:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Not convinced.\n\n0:15:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe I'm not fending better.\n\n0:15:34\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, you know, it's this fruit and vegetable year.\n\n0:15:38\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:39\tSPEAKER_00\n And they're not useful.\n\n0:15:41\tSPEAKER_00\n So maybe it is.\n\n0:15:42\tSPEAKER_05\n I think usefulness is, as I just have to remind you, that usefulness is much less important than fanciness.\n\n0:15:50\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:51\tSPEAKER_05\n Whether it's fancy or not, no, we have to decide.\n\n0:15:54\tSPEAKER_05\n But this.\n\n0:15:55\tSPEAKER_00\n I would have found more fancy that the fruits are useful.\n\n0:16:01\tSPEAKER_05\n So that maybe the fruit may be here.\n\n0:16:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, then it's a bit difficult to use.\n\n0:16:08\tSPEAKER_02\n We are just giving the fruits for more fanciness and more attraction.\n\n0:16:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:14\tSPEAKER_02\n So maybe I think we can have rubber or some sponges, stuff or strawberries and different colors.\n\n0:16:21\tSPEAKER_05\n So it seems we are even so clear the shape of this.\n\n0:16:25\tSPEAKER_00\n No, not sure.\n\n0:16:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Why?\n\n0:16:27\tSPEAKER_00\n If it was like this.\n\n0:16:29\tSPEAKER_02\n But it looks really.\n\n0:16:31\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not really good.\n\n0:16:32\tSPEAKER_02\n No, it's not fancy anymore.\n\n0:16:34\tSPEAKER_02\n So these are kind of rubber things, even if you lose one, how can you just put whatever.\n\n0:16:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Even we can provide many different colors and different fruits.\n\n0:16:42\tSPEAKER_02\n More or less.\n\n0:16:43\tSPEAKER_06\n It covers all the angles.\n\n0:16:45\tSPEAKER_06\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:46\tSPEAKER_06\n Even if it is, you know, it's very rounded, but still you got some rubber fruit here.\n\n0:16:50\tSPEAKER_06\n And it's completely, completely secure to leave it with children.\n\n0:16:55\tSPEAKER_06\n Okay.\n\n0:16:56\tSPEAKER_00\n So you feel like it's something a protection for the remote control.\n\n0:17:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, we have sensors here and so here and here.\n\n0:17:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Also.\n\n0:17:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:07\tSPEAKER_02\n So even if you don't put it works, but this is really fine.\n\n0:17:10\tSPEAKER_05\n So just the three.\n\n0:17:11\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:17:12\tSPEAKER_05\n Because everybody doesn't seem to be convinced, although it's quite, you have good arguments.\n\n0:17:18\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:19\tSPEAKER_00\n But.\n\n0:17:20\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:17:21\tSPEAKER_05\n And the last one is adaptive.\n\n0:17:23\tSPEAKER_05\n This is not maybe not as important as the other one.\n\n0:17:27\tSPEAKER_05\n But can we adapt it to each personal use?\n\n0:17:32\tSPEAKER_06\n Sure.\n\n0:17:33\tSPEAKER_06\n Just look at it.\n\n0:17:34\tNone\n Great.\n\n0:17:35\tSPEAKER_07\n Full adaptable.\n\n0:17:36\tSPEAKER_06\n Full adaptable.\n\n0:17:37\tSPEAKER_07\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:38\tSPEAKER_05\n That's it.\n\n0:17:39\tSPEAKER_05\n So you can fit it to your palm.\n\n0:17:40\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:41\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:17:42\tSPEAKER_02\n What else can we need?\n\n0:17:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Do you think you are going to be able to do that with Titanium as well?\n\n0:17:46\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:47\tSPEAKER_00\n It's for Titanium.\n\n0:17:48\tSPEAKER_00\n It's for Titanium.\n\n0:17:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:50\tSPEAKER_04\n For Titanium.\n\n0:17:51\tSPEAKER_05\n If this is, if you're able to do that, then I think it is over one.\n\n0:17:56\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:17:57\tSPEAKER_05\n Let's go for one.\n\n0:17:59\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:18:00\tSPEAKER_05\n Now we have to do the average.\n\n0:18:03\tSPEAKER_05\n Three.\n\n0:18:04\tSPEAKER_05\n Three.\n\n0:18:05\tSPEAKER_05\n Three.\n\n0:18:06\tSPEAKER_05\n Three.\n\n0:18:07\tSPEAKER_05\n We are good at that.\n\n0:18:08\tSPEAKER_05\n It's 2.17.\n\n0:18:10\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:18:11\tSPEAKER_05\n 2.17.\n\n0:18:12\tSPEAKER_05\n That's nice.\n\n0:18:13\tSPEAKER_05\n 2.17.\n\n0:18:14\tSPEAKER_05\n Out of 7.\n\n0:18:16\tSPEAKER_05\n I think we have a good thing.\n\n0:18:20\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, that's all I had to say about Titanium.\n\n0:18:24\tSPEAKER_05\n So it's a good evaluation.\n\n0:18:26\tSPEAKER_05\n It seems to be good, yeah.\n\n0:18:27\tSPEAKER_05\n We have 2.17.\n\n0:18:28\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:29\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:18:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Thanks.\n\n0:18:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:18:32\tSPEAKER_00\n So now it has to fulfill the financial criteria.\n\n0:18:39\tSPEAKER_00\n So we have a chair.\n\n0:18:44\tSPEAKER_00\n And it's just a chair.\n\n0:18:51\tSPEAKER_05\n And it's so, so how many batteries do we need?\n\n0:18:57\tSPEAKER_05\n One battery.\n\n0:18:58\tSPEAKER_00\n One battery.\n\n0:18:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:19:00\tSPEAKER_05\n So, two.\n\n0:19:01\tSPEAKER_05\n Why two?\n\n0:19:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, this is one of the same.\n\n0:19:05\tSPEAKER_04\n No.\n\n0:19:06\tSPEAKER_04\n No.\n\n0:19:07\tSPEAKER_04\n Never install.\n\n0:19:08\tSPEAKER_05\n Two batteries are one.\n\n0:19:10\tSPEAKER_07\n Oh.\n\n0:19:11\tSPEAKER_02\n No, nobody's one.\n\n0:19:12\tSPEAKER_02\n We need only one.\n\n0:19:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Only one.\n\n0:19:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but the price is two.\n\n0:19:15\tSPEAKER_00\n No, no, sorry, sorry, sorry.\n\n0:19:17\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:19:18\tSPEAKER_04\n You never use the Excel?\n\n0:19:20\tSPEAKER_04\n No, never.\n\n0:19:21\tSPEAKER_04\n What's the limit?\n\n0:19:22\tSPEAKER_04\n It's okay, just I don't know.\n\n0:19:27\tSPEAKER_06\n It's not my field.\n\n0:19:29\tSPEAKER_06\n 12 bucks.\n\n0:19:30\tSPEAKER_04\n 12 bucks.\n\n0:19:31\tSPEAKER_04\n 12.5.\n\n0:19:32\tSPEAKER_04\n Check the number also.\n\n0:19:35\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, electronics.\n\n0:19:38\tSPEAKER_05\n We have sample chip.\n\n0:19:40\tSPEAKER_05\n It's a simple chip.\n\n0:19:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Simple chip.\n\n0:19:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:19:44\tSPEAKER_02\n One.\n\n0:19:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:46\tSPEAKER_02\n For buttons.\n\n0:19:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:19:48\tSPEAKER_02\n For the sample speaker or sensor for speech recognition.\n\n0:19:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Here.\n\n0:19:52\tSPEAKER_00\n One also.\n\n0:19:53\tSPEAKER_02\n What are two?\n\n0:19:54\tSPEAKER_05\n One.\n\n0:19:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:19:56\tSPEAKER_05\n So, the case.\n\n0:19:57\tSPEAKER_05\n Which one is it in the end?\n\n0:20:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I think we will go for single.\n\n0:20:03\tSPEAKER_02\n It's single.\n\n0:20:04\tSPEAKER_04\n It's flat.\n\n0:20:05\tSPEAKER_04\n It's flat.\n\n0:20:06\tSPEAKER_04\n It's flat.\n\n0:20:07\tSPEAKER_04\n It curved.\n\n0:20:08\tSPEAKER_00\n I thought you can curve it.\n\n0:20:10\tSPEAKER_00\n It's flat.\n\n0:20:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Curveable.\n\n0:20:12\tSPEAKER_04\n It's curable, but it's not curved.\n\n0:20:15\tSPEAKER_04\n Maybe there's a superman for that or what.\n\n0:20:17\tSPEAKER_04\n So, it's only in curve.\n\n0:20:19\tSPEAKER_00\n I think the price is this one.\n\n0:20:22\tSPEAKER_00\n This one.\n\n0:20:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:20:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Don't shoot.\n\n0:20:25\tSPEAKER_07\n We tried.\n\n0:20:29\tSPEAKER_07\n We tried.\n\n0:20:30\tSPEAKER_06\n Okay.\n\n0:20:31\tSPEAKER_06\n So, what is it?\n\n0:20:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Titanium.\n\n0:20:34\tSPEAKER_05\n That's expensive.\n\n0:20:35\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:20:36\tSPEAKER_00\n The first titanium, I think it's fine.\n\n0:20:40\tSPEAKER_00\n It's thick.\n\n0:20:41\tSPEAKER_00\n It's Titan.\n\n0:20:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Special color?\n\n0:20:43\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:20:44\tSPEAKER_05\n No, no, no.\n\n0:20:47\tSPEAKER_00\n No, no.\n\n0:20:48\tSPEAKER_00\n No, no.\n\n0:20:49\tSPEAKER_00\n No, no.\n\n0:20:50\tSPEAKER_00\n No, no.\n\n0:20:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, sorry.\n\n0:20:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Again.\n\n0:20:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Special color.\n\n0:20:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh.\n\n0:20:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Or it's only on the.\n\n0:20:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:58\tSPEAKER_00\n In LCD display.\n\n0:20:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:01\tSPEAKER_00\n But there is no color here.\n\n0:21:02\tSPEAKER_02\n So, I put it here.\n\n0:21:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Pushboard on.\n\n0:21:05\tSPEAKER_02\n So, the LCD.\n\n0:21:06\tSPEAKER_00\n How many push buttons?\n\n0:21:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Three or two?\n\n0:21:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Two.\n\n0:21:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Two.\n\n0:21:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Is there the score?\n\n0:21:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:14\tNone\n One is active.\n\n0:21:16\tSPEAKER_01\n One else.\n\n0:21:17\tSPEAKER_01\n One else.\n\n0:21:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Display.\n\n0:21:19\tSPEAKER_02\n That's all.\n\n0:21:22\tSPEAKER_00\n No, here.\n\n0:21:23\tSPEAKER_00\n We choose this one and not this one.\n\n0:21:25\tNone\n Oh, I think no.\n\n0:21:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Is it the scroll wheel and push button?\n\n0:21:29\tSPEAKER_04\n This is the only scroll wheel.\n\n0:21:30\tNone\n Only scroll wheel.\n\n0:21:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Only scroll wheel.\n\n0:21:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:21:34\tSPEAKER_05\n So, trying to make sure that you have it.\n\n0:21:49\tSPEAKER_00\n How do you do to select?\n\n0:21:52\tSPEAKER_00\n No, but you select with the two.\n\n0:21:54\tSPEAKER_05\n The other two out.\n\n0:21:55\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, you go on the location with your.\n\n0:21:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, and then you.\n\n0:21:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Then it automatically.\n\n0:22:00\tSPEAKER_02\n We can just do like if you.\n\n0:22:02\tSPEAKER_02\n You go.\n\n0:22:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Oops.\n\n0:22:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it's price is really.\n\n0:22:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:22:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Special colors.\n\n0:22:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:11\tSPEAKER_06\n Four buttons.\n\n0:22:12\tSPEAKER_06\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:13\tSPEAKER_07\n Buttons and strawberries.\n\n0:22:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Special form.\n\n0:22:20\tSPEAKER_00\n You have all of this, no?\n\n0:22:24\tSPEAKER_04\n She's very hard on this.\n\n0:22:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Special card.\n\n0:22:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe not this one with.\n\n0:22:30\tSPEAKER_05\n No, special material.\n\n0:22:32\tSPEAKER_05\n We have.\n\n0:22:33\tSPEAKER_05\n That's for buttons.\n\n0:22:34\tSPEAKER_05\n But buttons are standard.\n\n0:22:35\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, buttons are standard.\n\n0:22:36\tSPEAKER_05\n It's only buttons.\n\n0:22:37\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:38\tSPEAKER_00\n So.\n\n0:22:39\tSPEAKER_05\n Nothing special.\n\n0:22:40\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:41\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:22:42\tSPEAKER_05\n So we are at 17.8.\n\n0:22:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Not special colors.\n\n0:22:45\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:22:46\tSPEAKER_05\n No, the color is in the LCD.\n\n0:22:48\tSPEAKER_00\n And the buttons are not colorized.\n\n0:22:51\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know.\n\n0:22:52\tSPEAKER_02\n I think the speakers go for.\n\n0:22:55\tSPEAKER_02\n We can just use this red.\n\n0:22:57\tSPEAKER_00\n It's already too expensive.\n\n0:23:00\tSPEAKER_05\n So what is, are we supposed to cut things out now?\n\n0:23:06\tSPEAKER_05\n Until we get 12.50.\n\n0:23:08\tSPEAKER_00\n So think of what we can cut here.\n\n0:23:17\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, if I look at what is the most expensive thing, it's the LCD and the speaker.\n\n0:23:27\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Apparently we have to choose one or the other.\n\n0:23:32\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:33\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:34\tSPEAKER_06\n Well, as you may know, there are some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical energy.\n\n0:23:42\tSPEAKER_06\n I mean, producing electricity from mechanical energy.\n\n0:23:45\tSPEAKER_06\n So the point is that when you take the device and push the button, you produce enough energy.\n\n0:23:51\tSPEAKER_00\n That you don't need the battery.\n\n0:23:53\tSPEAKER_06\n Yeah, that you don't need the battery.\n\n0:23:55\tSPEAKER_06\n So it's something like a hand dynamo, but a real high-tech version of it.\n\n0:24:01\tSPEAKER_00\n But it's like the hand dynamo.\n\n0:24:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe the jack wheel can be like that.\n\n0:24:08\tSPEAKER_05\n So, but if we select the hand dynamo, it's okay.\n\n0:24:10\tSPEAKER_05\n We only win one.\n\n0:24:12\tSPEAKER_05\n That's already that.\n\n0:24:13\tSPEAKER_06\n It's okay.\n\n0:24:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's do that.\n\n0:24:15\tSPEAKER_06\n Let's do that.\n\n0:24:16\tSPEAKER_06\n So,\n\n0:24:17\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm here.\n\n0:24:23\tSPEAKER_06\n And I propose to, so, about chips, advanced chip on print, right?\n\n0:24:30\tSPEAKER_06\n So put minus one there, please.\n\n0:24:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Let's hear this is legal.\n\n0:24:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Why not?\n\n0:24:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's try.\n\n0:24:40\tSPEAKER_06\n And then?\n\n0:24:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe minus three, no?\n\n0:24:48\tSPEAKER_02\n So, was the result?\n\n0:24:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's have a look.\n\n0:24:50\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not changing, no?\n\n0:24:51\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:24:52\tSPEAKER_05\n You click somewhere, you see if it changes.\n\n0:24:54\tSPEAKER_05\n Oops.\n\n0:24:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes, it does.\n\n0:24:56\tSPEAKER_05\n Maybe put minus two, so it looks more reasonable?\n\n0:25:01\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:02\tSPEAKER_04\n Why not?\n\n0:25:03\tSPEAKER_07\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:04\tSPEAKER_07\n Anyway, the minus rate.\n\n0:25:07\tSPEAKER_05\n Nobody will know.\n\n0:25:09\tSPEAKER_05\n It's not recorded, is it?\n\n0:25:12\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, we're on time.\n\n0:25:13\tSPEAKER_05\n Good.\n\n0:25:14\tSPEAKER_02\n It's an obvious we can increase one.\n\n0:25:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Still be out to one.\n\n0:25:18\tSPEAKER_02\n We can put a hand in a battery.\n\n0:25:21\tSPEAKER_00\n A battery, yeah.\n\n0:25:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Both.\n\n0:25:23\tSPEAKER_00\n It's cool.\n\n0:25:24\tSPEAKER_05\n No, now we're exceeding.\n\n0:25:26\tSPEAKER_05\n Now it's fancy.\n\n0:25:27\tSPEAKER_06\n Let's add one instead of two.\n\n0:25:30\tSPEAKER_04\n I think we're exceeding now.\n\n0:25:33\tSPEAKER_02\n We have a point five point three.\n\n0:25:35\tSPEAKER_05\n I think the accounting is maximum.\n\n0:25:40\tSPEAKER_05\n Maximum is maximum.\n\n0:25:42\tSPEAKER_05\n So remove one of them.\n\n0:25:44\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:25:45\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, we're on target.\n\n0:25:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:25:49\tSPEAKER_00\n So target reached.\n\n0:25:51\tSPEAKER_05\n I'm just curious to see this.\n\n0:25:54\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, what a contest.\n\n0:25:56\tSPEAKER_00\n It's an English trick.\n\n0:26:00\tSPEAKER_05\n I would say it's the Russian trick, but anyway.\n\n0:26:05\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a marked 20s English.\n\n0:26:07\tSPEAKER_06\n I'm not sure who was programming this calculator.\n\n0:26:16\tSPEAKER_06\n I wonder if we put a or b somewhere instead of a number.\n\n0:26:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's try.\n\n0:26:24\tSPEAKER_00\n No, no, no, no.\n\n0:26:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Let's finish this up.\n\n0:26:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:26:27\tSPEAKER_02\n We can discuss all these things in our party.\n\n0:26:31\tSPEAKER_04\n What else?\n\n0:26:32\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:26:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so next.\n\n0:26:40\tSPEAKER_04\n No, that's your last name.\n\n0:26:47\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:26:48\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:26:49\tSPEAKER_05\n And that's done.\n\n0:26:50\tSPEAKER_05\n Are the costs under 12?\n\n0:26:52\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:26:53\tSPEAKER_05\n Project evaluation.\n\n0:26:54\tSPEAKER_04\n Good.\n\n0:26:55\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:26:56\tSPEAKER_04\n So now.\n\n0:26:57\tSPEAKER_04\n Project process.\n\n0:26:59\tSPEAKER_00\n We have to make a.\n\n0:27:02\tSPEAKER_05\n Self assessment.\n\n0:27:03\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:04\tSPEAKER_00\n See how are we a good team?\n\n0:27:09\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, I think we've listened to everybody.\n\n0:27:13\tSPEAKER_05\n Everybody could say what they thought.\n\n0:27:17\tSPEAKER_00\n And is there enough room for creativity?\n\n0:27:22\tSPEAKER_06\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:23\tSPEAKER_05\n And when we see the results, no doubt.\n\n0:27:29\tSPEAKER_05\n Maybe a lack of leadership.\n\n0:27:36\tSPEAKER_04\n Teamwork.\n\n0:27:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Very strong.\n\n0:27:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:39\tSPEAKER_05\n Teamwork.\n\n0:27:40\tNone\n Teamwork.\n\n0:27:41\tSPEAKER_05\n Means.\n\n0:27:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Whiteboard, digital pens.\n\n0:27:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, these little things.\n\n0:27:46\tSPEAKER_06\n What was the?\n\n0:27:47\tSPEAKER_06\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:27:48\tSPEAKER_06\n What was good?\n\n0:27:49\tSPEAKER_06\n Never seen.\n\n0:27:50\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:51\tSPEAKER_04\n Whiteboard is useful.\n\n0:27:52\tSPEAKER_05\n Digital pens useful.\n\n0:27:58\tSPEAKER_05\n New ID's found.\n\n0:27:59\tSPEAKER_00\n So you say leadership.\n\n0:28:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:28:09\tSPEAKER_00\n So luck.\n\n0:28:10\tSPEAKER_00\n But good.\n\n0:28:11\tSPEAKER_00\n But then.\n\n0:28:12\tSPEAKER_00\n We can play good team performance.\n\n0:28:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:15\tSPEAKER_00\n But then I.\n\n0:28:16\tSPEAKER_06\n Good leader.\n\n0:28:17\tSPEAKER_06\n No.\n\n0:28:18\tSPEAKER_06\n Good leader is somewhere in the shade.\n\n0:28:19\tSPEAKER_05\n That's true.\n\n0:28:20\tSPEAKER_05\n And there's one very important point.\n\n0:28:22\tSPEAKER_05\n We are on time.\n\n0:28:23\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:24\tSPEAKER_05\n We also finish when they have to even before.\n\n0:28:29\tSPEAKER_05\n We made that for me.\n\n0:28:30\tSPEAKER_05\n It's one of the most important things.\n\n0:28:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Of course.\n\n0:28:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:28:35\tSPEAKER_04\n Not twice time.\n\n0:28:37\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:38\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:39\tSPEAKER_05\n We have either remote controls to create.\n\n0:28:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:28:44\tSPEAKER_02\n We got new idea of speech recognition, location finding, new materials, new materials, new stuff, fancy strawberry design.\n\n0:28:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:57\tSPEAKER_00\n New ways of doing financial.\n\n0:28:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Just wondering.\n\n0:28:59\tSPEAKER_05\n I'm not the pinkness of that.\n\n0:29:03\tSPEAKER_05\n They're working on a pink titanium.\n\n0:29:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:29:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Great.\n\n0:29:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, very good.\n\n0:29:10\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we're great.\n\n0:29:11\tSPEAKER_02\n No other words for that.\n\n0:29:13\tSPEAKER_05\n We are probably the best real reaction.\n\n0:29:18\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:19\tSPEAKER_04\n We're really nice.\n\n0:29:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:24\tSPEAKER_00\n We finish.\n\n0:29:25\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's celebration.\n\n0:29:27\tSPEAKER_05\n Are the costs within the budget?\n\n0:29:29\tSPEAKER_05\n Of course.\n\n0:29:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Is the project evaluated?\n\n0:29:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:34\tSPEAKER_06\n We got two.\n\n0:29:35\tSPEAKER_06\n So you see, we can even forecast all the day proposals like celebration, everything.\n\n0:29:42\tSPEAKER_06\n We could forecast it, right?\n\n0:29:44\tSPEAKER_05\n To whom?\n\n0:29:45\tSPEAKER_05\n To the whole company?\n\n0:29:46\tSPEAKER_05\n I'm the one proposing the celebration.\n\n0:29:49\tSPEAKER_00\n You?\n\n0:29:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Of course, you know, I'm the programmer nature.\n\n0:29:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:29:54\tSPEAKER_05\n So that's our break.\n\n0:29:55\tSPEAKER_05\n You too.\n\n0:29:56\tSPEAKER_07\n You too, right?\n\n0:29:57\tSPEAKER_00\n I think the beginning is.\n\n0:29:59\tSPEAKER_05\n I think the beginning is.\n\n0:30:00\tSPEAKER_05\n The beginning is over.\n\n0:30:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:02\tSPEAKER_02\n We have to.\n\n0:30:03\tSPEAKER_02\n We can display it out.\n\n0:30:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:30:05\tSPEAKER_00\n And we go to the party.\n\n0:30:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Thank you.\n\n0:30:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Thank you.\n\n0:30:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Nice job.\n\n0:30:19\tNone\n Thank you.\n\n0:30:27\tNone\n So we can keep that one.\n\n0:30:36\tNone\n Thank you.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "Marc and Rama are
