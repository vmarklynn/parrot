And the field of material has to be spongy.\n\n0:06:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:06:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Has that something to do with that natural feeling also, do you think?\n\n0:06:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, it might.\n\n0:06:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Personally, I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control.\n\n0:06:31\tSPEAKER_01\n But maybe some soft material or something.\n\n0:06:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:06:37\tSPEAKER_03\n So it might not be too hard.\n\n0:06:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe rubber or.\n\n0:06:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n0:06:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:06:46\tSPEAKER_01\n And like a way of doing.\n\n0:06:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, it likes familiar materials.\n\n0:06:51\tSPEAKER_01\n But that doesn't mean we should use wood.\n\n0:06:54\tSPEAKER_01\n So.\n\n0:06:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:06:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, this is an example of what they would like.\n\n0:07:01\tSPEAKER_01\n But since we're concentrating on the young group, I think we should use soft materials.\n\n0:07:09\tSPEAKER_01\n And make it colorful or like cell phones, exchangeable colors.\n\n0:07:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:19\tSPEAKER_01\n So we could provide both for the young and the old.\n\n0:07:24\tSPEAKER_01\n What they like.\n\n0:07:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, that's interesting.\n\n0:07:27\tSPEAKER_02\n It's quite interesting.\n\n0:07:28\tSPEAKER_03\n You could make a few very colorful ones.\n\n0:07:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:32\tSPEAKER_03\n And a very traditional corporate.\n\n0:07:34\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm thinking about the banana ramat, telephone from Siemens.\n\n0:07:38\tSPEAKER_02\n The yellow rubber.\n\n0:07:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:42\tSPEAKER_02\n It's the rubber.\n\n0:07:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it is.\n\n0:07:44\tSPEAKER_02\n It is.\n\n0:07:45\tSPEAKER_02\n It is.\n\n0:07:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:47\tSPEAKER_02\n And it's colorful.\n\n0:07:48\tSPEAKER_02\n It looks like the banana.\n\n0:07:49\tSPEAKER_02\n We have the fruit.\n\n0:07:50\tSPEAKER_02\n We have the colors.\n\n0:07:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you know the phone design?\n\n0:07:53\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know the phone.\n\n0:07:54\tSPEAKER_02\n It's the Siemens C25.\n\n0:07:56\tSPEAKER_03\n I believe it's the one the posthbank gave away.\n\n0:07:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, that one.\n\n0:08:00\tSPEAKER_02\n The very light blue.\n\n0:08:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, I know.\n\n0:08:02\tSPEAKER_02\n And it's also a yellow.\n\n0:08:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, I've seen it.\n\n0:08:04\tSPEAKER_02\n I've seen it.\n\n0:08:05\tSPEAKER_03\n You know, Ruth, as well.\n\n0:08:07\tSPEAKER_03\n I've seen it.\n\n0:08:08\tSPEAKER_03\n But.\n\n0:08:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:08:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:08:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Do you have...\n\n0:08:13\tSPEAKER_03\n That was...\n\n0:08:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that's about it.\n\n0:08:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:08:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:08:17\tSPEAKER_03\n So the important findings are...\n\n0:08:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Innovation is more important than ease of use for the art target group.\n\n0:08:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:25\tSPEAKER_03\n And coloring is important and...\n\n0:08:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Soft materials.\n\n0:08:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Soft materials.\n\n0:08:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:08:32\tSPEAKER_02\n So ease of use is important.\n\n0:08:34\tSPEAKER_02\n But technology is twice as important.\n\n0:08:37\tSPEAKER_02\n And what was even more important?\n\n0:08:40\tSPEAKER_01\n And defense, you look and feel.\n\n0:08:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:08:43\tSPEAKER_02\n So that's the most important thing for our customer.\n\n0:08:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, our customer.\n\n0:08:46\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:08:47\tNone\n Rule.\n\n0:08:48\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Could you do your presentation?\n\n0:08:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Mm-hmm.\n\n0:09:00\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't really have much to add.\n\n0:09:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Because most of the things we already said in the previous discussion.\n\n0:09:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:09:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, it's good to sum up the things we already thought about.\n\n0:09:27\tSPEAKER_02\n The previous ideas were a voice recognition and the round button for the channel programming and volume.\n\n0:09:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, a few interface I found on the internet are these.\n\n0:09:41\tSPEAKER_02\n These are both with a voice recognition.\n\n0:09:44\tSPEAKER_02\n But they're very advanced and very high tech and just, well, a weird shape.\n\n0:09:53\tSPEAKER_02\n So I suggest I couldn't, I had a small mock up sign on the paper.\n\n0:10:03\tSPEAKER_02\n But it didn't work.\n\n0:10:05\tSPEAKER_02\n But Penn didn't load the information.\n\n0:10:08\tSPEAKER_02\n So I made a really simple shape on a PowerPoint.\n\n0:10:16\tSPEAKER_02\n But we could make around an oval with...\n\n0:10:23\tSPEAKER_02\n It's mind control.\n\n0:10:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, a lot of organic.\n\n0:10:25\tSPEAKER_02\n So that's very good.\n\n0:10:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:27\tSPEAKER_03\n And what I'm thinking about maybe we should make very light but a grip.\n\n0:10:34\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, this is how you hold a remote control.\n\n0:10:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:10:39\tSPEAKER_03\n It shouldn't be too glott, too slippery.\n\n0:10:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Slippery.\n\n0:10:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Because...\n\n0:10:47\tSPEAKER_02\n You have something like the cement phone.\n\n0:10:50\tSPEAKER_02\n It's rubber.\n\n0:10:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n0:10:52\tSPEAKER_02\n It's easy in your hand, indeed.\n\n0:10:54\tSPEAKER_02\n There are also remote controls who have a little shape underneath, where you can put your fingers.\n\n0:11:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Or you can get a really good grip on it.\n\n0:11:02\tSPEAKER_02\n So you don't have to...\n\n0:11:04\tSPEAKER_02\n...tame much pressure to it.\n\n0:11:06\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a lot easier.\n\n0:11:08\tSPEAKER_03\n It grips automatically.\n\n0:11:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:11:11\tSPEAKER_02\n But I'll go into that deeper in my presentation.\n\n0:11:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:11:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Good.\n\n0:11:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:11:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, and to add on RUTES information.\n\n0:11:28\tSPEAKER_02\n In this interface, we can have a high tech with the voice recognition and the defense colors and so on.\n\n0:11:39\tSPEAKER_02\n And still have the ease of use because we have an easy interface.\n\n0:11:44\tSPEAKER_02\n And all the other remote controls are high tech in buttons.\n\n0:11:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:49\tSPEAKER_02\n And the road.\n\n0:11:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Way too much, I think, far goal.\n\n0:11:52\tSPEAKER_02\n So if you have the voice recognition, you can program light 30...\n\n0:11:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:12:00\tSPEAKER_02\n But I'll go into that because there are some possibilities and some impossibilities.\n\n0:12:06\tSPEAKER_02\n I had a talk with our manufacturing division.\n\n0:12:10\tSPEAKER_02\n And we had a talk about all the different components...\n\n0:12:15\tSPEAKER_02\n...who are in this design.\n\n0:12:17\tSPEAKER_02\n These are the things we've looked at.\n\n0:12:21\tSPEAKER_02\n And of course, I used a web to find my information.\n\n0:12:25\tSPEAKER_02\n About casing.\n\n0:12:27\tSPEAKER_02\n We have three different casing possibilities.\n\n0:12:30\tSPEAKER_02\n We have the uncurved or flat case.\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_02\n That's the most common remote control form we're used to.\n\n0:12:38\tSPEAKER_02\n It's just a box.\n\n0:12:40\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm sorry, I don't have any pictures of this thing.\n\n0:12:44\tSPEAKER_02\n We have a curved one.\n\n0:12:46\tSPEAKER_02\n It's curved in two dimensions.\n\n0:12:48\tSPEAKER_02\n You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form.\n\n0:12:51\tSPEAKER_02\n So it's a little more advanced in its shape.\n\n0:12:55\tSPEAKER_02\n And we have an even more advanced shape, which is curved in three dimensions.\n\n0:12:59\tSPEAKER_02\n I think you can compare it a little bit with the big ray image you had in your presentation.\n\n0:13:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:07\tSPEAKER_02\n The big remote control, something like that.\n\n0:13:09\tSPEAKER_02\n But it's quite advanced and it's quite daring to use, I think.\n\n0:13:17\tSPEAKER_02\n For these caseings, we have different types of finishing.\n\n0:13:21\tSPEAKER_02\n We can use plastic, which is very slippery and maybe not so nice, but you can give it any color.\n\n0:13:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Which is the same for rubber, but it's not slippery.\n\n0:13:31\tSPEAKER_02\n We can use wood and titanium.\n\n0:13:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, we cannot use the titanium on the double curved cases.\n\n0:13:39\tSPEAKER_02\n And these latex cases, there's just the plastic ones.\n\n0:13:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source.\n\n0:13:47\tSPEAKER_02\n So which brings me to the different energy sources.\n\n0:13:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, we even seem to have hand-dynamos for powering our remote control.\n\n0:14:01\tSPEAKER_02\n You really have to imagine like winding a rope.\n\n0:14:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, it would be very new to the market.\n\n0:14:08\tSPEAKER_03\n It would be very new.\n\n0:14:10\tSPEAKER_02\n But it's kind of a retro style.\n\n0:14:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, this is quite interesting.\n\n0:14:16\tSPEAKER_02\n There's also a kinetic energy supply.\n\n0:14:19\tSPEAKER_02\n So when you're watching TV or when you have to make some kind of energy, kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall, whatever you want.\n\n0:14:33\tSPEAKER_02\n It has to move. That's the sense of it.\n\n0:14:37\tSPEAKER_02\n And you can store the energy in the thing.\n\n0:14:40\tSPEAKER_03\n I think if I can hook onto that, the kinetic thing is very funny.\n\n0:14:48\tSPEAKER_03\n It's very funny indeed.\n\n0:14:49\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, solar is, of course, it's nice, but it's, well, your calculator has a solar panel.\n\n0:14:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Indeed.\n\n0:14:56\tSPEAKER_02\n But if you're watching a movie, how many times you take the remote control?\n\n0:15:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, maybe if you have a watch, you have the kinetic idea in a watch also.\n\n0:15:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I know.\n\n0:15:07\tSPEAKER_02\n You work.\n\n0:15:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:15:09\tSPEAKER_02\n But you know from your own watch.\n\n0:15:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Your watch uses a minimal, it consumes a minimal amount of energy.\n\n0:15:15\tSPEAKER_02\n When the shaking of your body, which is almost every activity, makes your body shake, charges it.\n\n0:15:23\tSPEAKER_02\n But the problem here is that it supplies a very little amount of kinetic energy.\n\n0:15:29\tSPEAKER_02\n So I think you have a problem when you're watching a movie and you haven't moved the remote control in a amount of time.\n\n0:15:39\tSPEAKER_02\n And you want to switch the channel or something.\n\n0:15:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, it might not work, so that's something you have to keep in mind.\n\n0:15:47\tSPEAKER_02\n But maybe there's a possibility to combine it with traditional batteries.\n\n0:15:54\tSPEAKER_02\n So we can save on the batteries and when there's a near kinetic energy used, kinetic energy, and otherwise use the batteries.\n\n0:16:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, because I guess the voice recognition feature consumes quite a lot of power.\n\n0:16:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, it does.\n\n0:16:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:09\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll come to that later.\n\n0:16:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay. And we of course have the traditional solar power, which is just a piece of material on the remote control, which transfers light energy into electricity.\n\n0:16:25\tSPEAKER_02\n The user interface controls.\n\n0:16:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Of course we have the push buttons and we also have scroll wheels.\n\n0:16:33\tSPEAKER_02\n And these scroll wheels can also be integrated with buttons.\n\n0:16:36\tSPEAKER_02\n So it's just like a mouse. You can scroll them. You can also push it.\n\n0:16:44\tSPEAKER_02\n In the indicators, we have the LCD displays, which means you can watch in a display, which generally you have chosen or something like that of the amount of volume, which is currently.\n\n0:17:02\tSPEAKER_02\n And we also have double scroll buttons, which are just two of these things.\n\n0:17:07\tSPEAKER_02\n So we don't really have the kind of button we had in mind in our last meeting.\n\n0:17:14\tSPEAKER_02\n The thing with the round for now, we can just make four push buttons in the form of a round.\n\n0:17:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:17:23\tSPEAKER_02\n That's possible too.\n\n0:17:25\tSPEAKER_02\n But I don't think the scroll wheels, I had some information about it too.\n\n0:17:30\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll wheels.\n\n0:17:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I can't see any scenario where you would use a scroll wheel with a button on it.\n\n0:17:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, we need them.\n\n0:17:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe we need to be remote.\n\n0:17:48\tSPEAKER_03\n With maybe the channel selector.\n\n0:17:53\tSPEAKER_03\n What about integrating a scroll bar on this side?\n\n0:17:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that's possibility.\n\n0:18:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Because this is how you keep it.\n\n0:18:03\tSPEAKER_02\n The floor is quite good.\n\n0:18:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Think about a scenario where you would use the scroll button.\n\n0:18:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Volume.\n\n0:18:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, what he means is there's an integrated in a scroll wheel.\n\n0:18:16\tSPEAKER_02\n There's no scenario where you use the button in the scroll wheel.\n\n0:18:20\tSPEAKER_02\n You just use the wheel.\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, what about mute?\n\n0:18:23\tSPEAKER_03\n About mute.\n\n0:18:24\tSPEAKER_03\n And I can either on this side or this side.\n\n0:18:27\tSPEAKER_02\n That's one possibility.\n\n0:18:29\tSPEAKER_03\n And click it to mute the device.\n\n0:18:33\tSPEAKER_03\n And it makes it different from the traditional devices on this market.\n\n0:18:38\tSPEAKER_03\n So I'm looking for a way to make it a little different than the traditional ones.\n\n0:18:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:18:46\tSPEAKER_03\n So maybe, I guess that's something you need to think about.\n\n0:18:52\tSPEAKER_03\n What do you think about a scroll bar?\n\n0:18:57\tSPEAKER_03\n So a wheel.\n\n0:18:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, it's obviously new.\n\n0:19:03\tSPEAKER_01\n So it might attract the young customers.\n\n0:19:07\tSPEAKER_02\n But it's done before.\n\n0:19:09\tSPEAKER_02\n There are many other devices like telephones and radio pocket radios.\n\n0:19:15\tSPEAKER_02\n We use this.\n\n0:19:16\tSPEAKER_02\n And well, it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now.\n\n0:19:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, all the Sony telephones use it, for example, for volume.\n\n0:19:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Nokia has it, well, okay, it's not really a scroll wheel.\n\n0:19:30\tSPEAKER_03\n But on their side, the volume button is on the side because you grab it like this.\n\n0:19:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:19:38\tSPEAKER_02\n But it uses two separate buttons.\n\n0:19:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:41\tSPEAKER_02\n I know it's not really a scroll wheel.\n\n0:19:44\tSPEAKER_02\n It's something for you too.\n\n0:19:47\tSPEAKER_02\n I believe if you have what we've already said, the grip places in the remote control.\n\n0:19:55\tSPEAKER_02\n You have your hand on one place on the remote control.\n\n0:19:58\tSPEAKER_02\n So you have to place all the buttons in the range of your thumb.\n\n0:20:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, you have to.\n\n0:20:03\tSPEAKER_02\n So in that case, the volume button on the side of the remote control would be perfect.\n\n0:20:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:20:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Sebastian.\n\n0:20:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:20:10\tSPEAKER_02\n We have to note, if you want to use these rubber double curved case, you must use these push buttons.\n\n0:20:17\tSPEAKER_02\n There's no way you can integrate LCD displays.\n\n0:20:20\tSPEAKER_02\n There's no way you can integrate the scroll wheels because it's all curved.\n\n0:20:23\tSPEAKER_02\n There are no flat areas where you can incorporate these things.\n\n0:20:28\tSPEAKER_02\n So that's the limitation about the components just a hardware.\n\n0:20:36\tSPEAKER_02\n We basically have three types of chips we can use.\n\n0:20:40\tSPEAKER_02\n And these chips incorporate all the large-chica and hardware that is needed to send signal.\n\n0:20:49\tSPEAKER_02\n We have a simple regular and advanced chip.\n\n0:20:52\tSPEAKER_02\n And there is something like a simple sensor and simple speaker, which is a little cryptic to me.\n\n0:20:58\tSPEAKER_02\n But I think that's the voice recognition thing that we are thinking about.\n\n0:21:02\tSPEAKER_02\n You can have some information about it.\n\n0:21:06\tSPEAKER_02\n In the voice recognition, you say a word.\n\n0:21:09\tSPEAKER_02\n You can program a word like volume up.\n\n0:21:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:21:13\tSPEAKER_00\n So mute.\n\n0:21:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's say mute.\n\n0:21:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:21:16\tSPEAKER_02\n You program it.\n\n0:21:17\tSPEAKER_02\n You mute and you give an action to it.\n\n0:21:22\tSPEAKER_02\n That's just really the mute function.\n\n0:21:25\tSPEAKER_02\n And when you speak in the remote control, it repeats your saying.\n\n0:21:33\tSPEAKER_02\n So that's the simple sensor.\n\n0:21:35\tSPEAKER_02\n So if you say mute, it says mute again.\n\n0:21:38\tSPEAKER_02\n And then it's what I believe is...\n\n0:21:41\tSPEAKER_02\n It performs the action.\n\n0:21:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:44\tSPEAKER_02\n And then your repeat is action, which you believe it is.\n\n0:21:47\tSPEAKER_02\n You say mute.\n\n0:21:48\tSPEAKER_02\n You repeat mute and you make the computer sound mute and then goes to the mute function.\n\n0:21:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:21:55\tSPEAKER_02\n So that's basically the voice recognition item we were searching for.\n\n0:21:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:21:59\tSPEAKER_02\n This simple sensor requires a regular chip, I thought.\n\n0:22:06\tSPEAKER_02\n No, well, I'm not very sure.\n\n0:22:09\tSPEAKER_02\n No, it's not in here.\n\n0:22:10\tSPEAKER_02\n If we want to use the LCD display, we really need the advanced version, which is a little bit more costly.\n\n0:22:16\tSPEAKER_02\n If we want to use the scroll wheels, we need the regular version.\n\n0:22:20\tSPEAKER_02\n And if we don't want to use any of these more advanced functions, we can keep with the simple chip, which is a bit cheaper.\n\n0:22:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:22:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:22:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Did we already decide on the display?\n\n0:22:32\tSPEAKER_02\n No, but I think that's something for who are you?\n\n0:22:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, to think I don't have...\n\n0:22:40\tSPEAKER_02\n I haven't looked for information about it, but I don't think...\n\n0:22:44\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think you need it on the display, especially when we have to look at the costs.\n\n0:22:49\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think...\n\n0:22:50\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think you need it.\n\n0:22:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Any TV can...\n\n0:22:53\tSPEAKER_02\n If you want to use it on the screen, yeah.\n\n0:22:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:22:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:22:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:23:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, my conclusion.\n\n0:23:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Unfortunately, the market has decided a little...\n\n0:23:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Other than I thought, I thought the market would like a sort of titanium casing, but they seem to like natural stuff.\n\n0:23:15\tSPEAKER_02\n So maybe we should think about wood finish.\n\n0:23:21\tSPEAKER_02\n I've chosen the more battery with solar cell solution for the energy.\n\n0:23:26\tSPEAKER_02\n It's more reliable, it's cheaper.\n\n0:23:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:23:30\tSPEAKER_02\n So I don't think we should use the...\n\n0:23:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Kinetic thing.\n\n0:23:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Kinetic thing, it's possibility.\n\n0:23:36\tSPEAKER_02\n It's more advanced, but I think you should combine it with batteries.\n\n0:23:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:23:41\tSPEAKER_02\n It's maybe a bit too...\n\n0:23:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Too much...\n\n0:23:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:45\tSPEAKER_02\n In some way, it can give us an advantage, because you will save on your batteries.\n\n0:23:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but that's the same with the solar cell.\n\n0:23:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:23:55\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's more robust.\n\n0:23:56\tSPEAKER_02\n It's more...\n\n0:23:57\tSPEAKER_02\n But what about the...\n\n0:23:58\tSPEAKER_02\n It's more...\n\n0:23:59\tSPEAKER_02\n The market...\n\n0:24:00\tSPEAKER_02\n One's colorful designs.\n\n0:24:04\tSPEAKER_02\n So if we use titanium...\n\n0:24:07\tSPEAKER_03\n No, no.\n\n0:24:08\tSPEAKER_03\n That's what Sebastian said.\n\n0:24:10\tSPEAKER_03\n He said...\n\n0:24:13\tSPEAKER_03\n This is my personal preference, but I understood that the market is different.\n\n0:24:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, sorry.\n\n0:24:17\tSPEAKER_02\n So I think we should skip the titanium stuff, and we should use wood or something like that.\n\n0:24:22\tSPEAKER_01\n And I would...\n\n0:24:23\tSPEAKER_01\n No rubber with colors.\n\n0:24:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, the older people like wood.\n\n0:24:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, okay, sorry.\n\n0:24:26\tSPEAKER_02\n So it needs to be rubber.\n\n0:24:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Colorful.\n\n0:24:29\tSPEAKER_02\n And the younger people like soft material.\n\n0:24:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:24:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Spongebob.\n\n0:24:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:24:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, these scroll wheels...\n\n0:24:37\tSPEAKER_02\n I think they can be handy.\n\n0:24:41\tSPEAKER_02\n And they can be implemented with a regular chip?\n\n0:24:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, they can, but they really need a regular chip.\n\n0:24:46\tSPEAKER_02\n You cannot...\n\n0:24:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Not safe.\n\n0:24:48\tSPEAKER_02\n But we already need a regular chip, for example.\n\n0:24:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I'm not sure.\n\n0:24:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe there's some...\n\n0:24:52\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:24:53\tSPEAKER_03\n But do we want the curved design?\n\n0:24:56\tSPEAKER_02\n I think so.\n\n0:24:57\tSPEAKER_02\n If you stick with the simple straight forward, not curved design.\n\n0:25:03\tSPEAKER_02\n It's too dull.\n\n0:25:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:07\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think our customers will like it.\n\n0:25:09\tSPEAKER_02\n And if you take the double curved, then you cannot...\n\n0:25:14\tSPEAKER_02\n You can only use the rubber buttons.\n\n0:25:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:17\tSPEAKER_02\n And you cannot use the scroll wheels.\n\n0:25:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:25:19\tSPEAKER_02\n So I think this is the best of two rules.\n\n0:25:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:25:22\tSPEAKER_03\n What about the issue I addressed at the beginning of the meeting?\n\n0:25:30\tSPEAKER_03\n The voice function with the infrared issue.\n\n0:25:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:25:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Because it's...\n\n0:25:38\tSPEAKER_02\n I kind of imagine it's very dull to talk to a device.\n\n0:25:42\tSPEAKER_02\n If you have to point to another device.\n\n0:25:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:46\tSPEAKER_02\n It's very...\n\n0:25:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Relogical.\n\n0:25:48\tSPEAKER_02\n But most infrared remote controls don't have to be pointed at all.\n\n0:25:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, they don't have to be some pointing in.\n\n0:25:56\tSPEAKER_02\n It depends also on your...\n\n0:25:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, on your hand before.\n\n0:26:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, it won't work.\n\n0:26:01\tSPEAKER_02\n But you can point it just...\n\n0:26:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, it depends on your walls, actually.\n\n0:26:05\tSPEAKER_03\n If you have smooth walls, it probably...\n\n0:26:09\tSPEAKER_03\n You're probably right.\n\n0:26:11\tSPEAKER_03\n But if you have carpets on the wall.\n\n0:26:13\tSPEAKER_03\n All the less natural...\n\n0:26:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Which are natural loving friends probably do have.\n\n0:26:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Then, yeah.\n\n0:26:20\tSPEAKER_03\n It might be a bit more of a issue.\n\n0:26:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:26:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Because the walls reflect the infrared light.\n\n0:26:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:28\tSPEAKER_02\n So, it's easier.\n\n0:26:32\tSPEAKER_02\n I suggest we use the sensor sample.\n\n0:26:36\tSPEAKER_02\n The sample sensor and sample speaker.\n\n0:26:40\tSPEAKER_02\n With a regular chip.\n\n0:26:43\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it gives us the advantage of the scroll wheel.\n\n0:26:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:26:48\tSPEAKER_02\n I like the scroll wheels.\n\n0:26:50\tSPEAKER_02\n I skipped the LCD part.\n\n0:26:51\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think it's any value edits.\n\n0:26:54\tSPEAKER_02\n No, thanks.\n\n0:26:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, it looks...\n\n0:26:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, well, according to RUT, the market likes...\n\n0:27:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Technology.\n\n0:27:03\tSPEAKER_03\n New flash technology.\n\n0:27:04\tSPEAKER_03\n And I mean, LCD...\n\n0:27:05\tSPEAKER_03\n It's not very flash.\n\n0:27:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, I know, but it's less...\n\n0:27:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Standard?\n\n0:27:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Standard, then...\n\n0:27:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, we are not very...\n\n0:27:18\tSPEAKER_03\n We do not know much about the financial part.\n\n0:27:21\tSPEAKER_03\n That's the problem.\n\n0:27:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Because if we do have enough space in our finance, I would say do integrate it.\n\n0:27:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Because it adds a little extra high-tech feeling to it.\n\n0:27:35\tSPEAKER_02\n We all have the scroll wheels, the speaker recognition.\n\n0:27:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:41\tSPEAKER_02\n The rubber.\n\n0:27:42\tSPEAKER_02\n I think our customer is a color.\n\n0:27:44\tSPEAKER_02\n The fancy color?\n\n0:27:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:27:46\tSPEAKER_03\n It's too much.\n\n0:27:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:27:49\tSPEAKER_03\n I agree.\n\n0:27:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Do you have anything you would like to add or maybe thoughts or...\n\n0:27:59\tSPEAKER_01\n No, I don't think so.\n\n0:28:01\tSPEAKER_03\n No.\n\n0:28:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Sebastian, no, rule.\n\n0:28:03\tSPEAKER_03\n The rule.\n\n0:28:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you have any other?\n\n0:28:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Nothing more.\n\n0:28:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Nothing more.\n\n0:28:13\tSPEAKER_02\n The next phase will be...\n\n0:28:19\tSPEAKER_02\n What's the next phase to the floors?\n\n0:28:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, we need to describe decisions now.\n\n0:28:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:28:26\tSPEAKER_03\n So on energy, well, we decided...\n\n0:28:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Chip.\n\n0:28:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:28:31\tSPEAKER_03\n The case.\n\n0:28:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Rubber with one curve.\n\n0:28:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Use the interface.\n\n0:28:39\tSPEAKER_02\n But it can't go with...\n\n0:28:41\tSPEAKER_02\n With one curved case?\n\n0:28:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, they can work.\n\n0:28:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Sorry.\n\n0:28:46\tSPEAKER_02\n They cannot work with double curved.\n\n0:28:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, sorry.\n\n0:28:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Check it for you.\n\n0:28:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Then the corporate identity should be in the product.\n\n0:28:54\tSPEAKER_03\n I guess that is something for rule and Sebastian.\n\n0:28:58\tSPEAKER_03\n You talked about it before the colors.\n\n0:29:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Grey and yellow.\n\n0:29:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Keep it in mind.\n\n0:29:03\tSPEAKER_03\n And the buttons, well, we talked about it now.\n\n0:29:06\tSPEAKER_03\n The next phase...\n\n0:29:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Sebastian is...\n\n0:29:14\tSPEAKER_03\n The design of the look and feel.\n\n0:29:18\tSPEAKER_03\n The user interface design.\n\n0:29:20\tSPEAKER_03\n And for you, the product evaluation...\n\n0:29:24\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that.\n\n0:29:30\tSPEAKER_03\n And the ID and the UID need to work together on the prototype drawing on the smart board.\n\n0:29:37\tSPEAKER_03\n And I'm going to plan my holidays.\n\n0:29:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:29:42\tSPEAKER_02\n So, you will protect the colors for the next...\n\n0:29:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:47\tSPEAKER_03\n It's...\n\n0:29:48\tSPEAKER_03\n When we come back in 30 minutes, you will have a prototype ready.\n\n0:29:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:29:53\tSPEAKER_02\n So, can you give us a summary of all decisions we've made?\n\n0:29:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:57\tSPEAKER_03\n I can.\n\n0:29:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe one of you could write it down.\n\n0:30:00\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll do.\n\n0:30:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Great.\n\n0:30:05\tSPEAKER_03\n You need to help me.\n\n0:30:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:30:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Start with the casing.\n\n0:30:09\tSPEAKER_03\n The casing is curved.\n\n0:30:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Single curved.\n\n0:30:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Single curved.\n\n0:30:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:30:14\tSPEAKER_02\n What about the energy source?\n\n0:30:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Traditional batteries and solar.\n\n0:30:20\tSPEAKER_02\n But can I work together?\n\n0:30:23\tSPEAKER_02\n And you have to choose between them.\n\n0:30:26\tSPEAKER_02\n No, they can be complementary.\n\n0:30:28\tSPEAKER_02\n I think they can.\n\n0:30:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, I...\n\n0:30:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, every device...\n\n0:30:32\tSPEAKER_02\n It should be.\n\n0:30:33\tSPEAKER_02\n There should be no problem.\n\n0:30:35\tSPEAKER_02\n There can be supplementary.\n\n0:30:36\tSPEAKER_02\n There's no problem.\n\n0:30:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:30:41\tSPEAKER_02\n So, the energy source is...\n\n0:30:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Battery.\n\n0:30:45\tSPEAKER_02\n And solar.\n\n0:30:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:48\tSPEAKER_02\n What about the finishing of the case?\n\n0:30:52\tSPEAKER_02\n We have decided we wanted to use the rubber.\n\n0:30:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Colorful rubber.\n\n0:30:56\tSPEAKER_03\n If it's possible with different covers, but I'm not sure if our suppliers can help us with such a wish.\n\n0:31:07\tSPEAKER_02\n And I think we should use the company colors, something like black and red, of a black and yellow.\n\n0:31:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Gray and yellow.\n\n0:31:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Gray and yellow.\n\n0:31:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Yellow case and gray buttons.\n\n0:31:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, although I don't think that's very colorful, except for the yellow, of course.\n\n0:31:23\tSPEAKER_03\n But I could think of more attractive set of colors.\n\n0:31:28\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's...\n\n0:31:31\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not very dull.\n\n0:31:32\tSPEAKER_02\n It's quite modern, actually.\n\n0:31:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Don't you think?\n\n0:31:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, I was more thinking about the fruit colors that the root show just before.\n\n0:31:40\tSPEAKER_02\n But you have already...\n\n0:31:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Must have a red on and off button.\n\n0:31:46\tSPEAKER_02\n And...\n\n0:31:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, it doesn't have to be red.\n\n0:31:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Well...\n\n0:31:52\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, I think these colors are really what our young people are looking for.\n\n0:31:57\tSPEAKER_03\n So maybe it shouldn't even be two colors.\n\n0:32:00\tSPEAKER_03\n It should be a full-color cover with such an image.\n\n0:32:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Or... I mean, thinking in two colors is too black and white for our market group, I guess.\n\n0:32:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, black and yellow.\n\n0:32:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Black and yellow.\n\n0:32:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:32:18\tSPEAKER_02\n But I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on the device.\n\n0:32:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Because I agree it would be nice to have something like that on the device itself.\n\n0:32:29\tSPEAKER_02\n But... there is... just a week ago...\n\n0:32:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Keyboard manufacturer.\n\n0:32:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, I've been...\n\n0:32:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Friends.\n\n0:32:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, it's fine-ord and...\n\n0:32:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its techniques.\n\n0:32:44\tSPEAKER_02\n They're actually very slow in its techniques.\n\n0:32:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, so we have to deal with what's possible here.\n\n0:32:49\tSPEAKER_02\n So I'm afraid it's not possible.\n\n0:32:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:32:54\tSPEAKER_03\n More decisions we made.\n\n0:32:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Um...\n\n0:32:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Um...\n\n0:33:02\tSPEAKER_02\n The scroll wheel?\n\n0:33:04\tSPEAKER_02\n The scroll wheel?\n\n0:33:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:33:06\tSPEAKER_03\n The voice recognition.\n\n0:33:07\tSPEAKER_03\n We already decided.\n\n0:33:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:33:09\tSPEAKER_02\n So scroll wheel, but there will be some additional buttons, I guess.\n\n0:33:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:13\tSPEAKER_02\n And they should be spongy, also.\n\n0:33:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Because they're rubber, too.\n\n0:33:21\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm going to leave that up to you, too.\n\n0:33:24\tSPEAKER_02\n What did you say?\n\n0:33:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, you can use...\n\n0:33:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, when you use the buttons, they'll be made of rubber, too.\n\n0:33:33\tSPEAKER_02\n So...\n\n0:33:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:35\tSPEAKER_02\n It has the spongy fuel.\n\n0:33:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:37\tSPEAKER_02\n So I think that's okay.\n\n0:33:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, or you could use plastic buttons in the rubber.\n\n0:33:43\tSPEAKER_03\n I think rubber is nice.\n\n0:33:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Because it... I mean, what do you touch the button?\n\n0:33:49\tSPEAKER_03\n And what do they want?\n\n0:33:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Spunchy devices?\n\n0:33:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Or...\n\n0:33:55\tSPEAKER_02\n But then you just have the fact that...\n\n0:33:58\tSPEAKER_02\n The drones on the buttons will disappear eventually.\n\n0:34:03\tSPEAKER_03\n It's really?\n\n0:34:05\tSPEAKER_02\n What I said in the first discussion, the digit six on the button, it will disappear when it's from rubber.\n\n0:34:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Is that...\n\n0:34:14\tSPEAKER_03\n There's our...\n\n0:34:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Is it something...\n\n0:34:17\tSPEAKER_02\n No information I read about it or so, but...\n\n0:34:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Did we include the digits or leave them in the...\n\n0:34:25\tSPEAKER_01\n No, but...\n\n0:34:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Because things like volume could be placed next to the button.\n\n0:34:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:32\tSPEAKER_03\n You could place a...\n\n0:34:34\tSPEAKER_03\n This would read a button.\n\n0:34:37\tSPEAKER_03\n The scroll wheel, I mean.\n\n0:34:39\tSPEAKER_03\n And you could place the...\n\n0:34:41\tSPEAKER_03\n The signals.\n\n0:34:43\tSPEAKER_03\n So you don't...\n\n0:34:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, touch the possible icons.\n\n0:34:45\tSPEAKER_02\n But then you have...\n\n0:34:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Still the images on the rubber of the case.\n\n0:34:51\tSPEAKER_02\n That's still then, if you feel like...\n\n0:34:53\tSPEAKER_02\n If you feel your remote control, you just rub on the cover.\n\n0:34:57\tSPEAKER_02\n So you rub on the painting.\n\n0:35:00\tSPEAKER_03\n No, no, there's no painting.\n\n0:35:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Only yellow or...\n\n0:35:04\tSPEAKER_03\n The digits into the rubber.\n\n0:35:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Never, but the plus or the minus.\n\n0:35:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, the sign.\n\n0:35:09\tSPEAKER_02\n But this is on the...\n\n0:35:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it's on the cover.\n\n0:35:12\tSPEAKER_03\n I think...\n\n0:35:13\tSPEAKER_03\n I know which one is...\n\n0:35:14\tSPEAKER_03\n I know which one.\n\n0:35:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Just move the problem.\n\n0:35:16\tSPEAKER_03\n What about making this rubber...\n\n0:35:20\tSPEAKER_03\n And making this plastic?\n\n0:35:23\tSPEAKER_02\n I see what you mean.\n\n0:35:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, maybe that's possible, because our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing.\n\n0:35:34\tSPEAKER_02\n So maybe they can combine these two.\n\n0:35:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, actually we should have the other way around, I guess.\n\n0:35:41\tSPEAKER_03\n A plastic cover with rubber finishing.\n\n0:35:44\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, this is the finishing.\n\n0:35:46\tSPEAKER_03\n This is...\n\n0:35:48\tSPEAKER_03\n What's on the edge?\n\n0:35:50\tSPEAKER_03\n What you feel?\n\n0:35:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:52\tSPEAKER_03\n But the front, on which the buttons are, doesn't have to be rubber.\n\n0:35:57\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean...\n\n0:35:58\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm not so sure.\n\n0:35:59\tSPEAKER_02\n I think...\n\n0:36:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Can you separate these...\n\n0:36:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I'm not sure.\n\n0:36:02\tSPEAKER_02\n I have to ask with manufacturing.\n\n0:36:04\tSPEAKER_02\n But I'm not sure that's what you want, because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel.\n\n0:36:09\tSPEAKER_02\n And that's what you get with rubber.\n\n0:36:11\tSPEAKER_02\n So if you want to sponge you feel, you need to make these buttons all over rubber.\n\n0:36:17\tSPEAKER_03\n I know, but do you touch this, or do you touch this?\n\n0:36:21\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, I never touch between the buttons.\n\n0:36:24\tSPEAKER_02\n I do.\n\n0:36:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Or the sideways, or...\n\n0:36:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, the sideways.\n\n0:36:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Exactly, the sideways.\n\n0:36:30\tSPEAKER_03\n The side.\n\n0:36:31\tSPEAKER_03\n But do you touch between these buttons?\n\n0:36:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, especially when there are a few buttons on it, you have a lot of space to touch.\n\n0:36:42\tSPEAKER_02\n So you just have it in your hand completely, or...\n\n0:36:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay. Well, we do not have very much time left.\n\n0:36:49\tSPEAKER_03\n I guess you two have to figure that out.\n\n0:36:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I'm going to leave the decision to you, because you have to make it prototype.\n\n0:36:57\tSPEAKER_03\n And, yeah, you have the most knowledge about the suppliers, the possibilities, and...\n\n0:37:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:04\tSPEAKER_03\n So I'm going to leave the decision with you.\n\n0:37:07\tSPEAKER_03\n So, was it...\n\n0:37:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Did you write enough decisions down?\n\n0:37:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Not quite.\n\n0:37:12\tSPEAKER_02\n What about...\n\n0:37:15\tSPEAKER_02\n The chips.\n\n0:37:19\tSPEAKER_02\n We use the regular chips.\n\n0:37:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Regular.\n\n0:37:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:37:22\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:25\tSPEAKER_02\n And...\n\n0:37:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I think that's about it.\n\n0:37:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:37:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay. With those regular chips, we can still control advanced functions.\n\n0:37:38\tSPEAKER_03\n The chips is not really...\n\n0:37:40\tSPEAKER_02\n The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced version of the chips supports LCD.\n\n0:37:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay. Well.\n\n0:37:47\tSPEAKER_02\n And we've decided not to use LCD, so...\n\n0:37:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:37:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, then I think we are quite finished.\n\n0:37:56\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll see you guys in 30 minutes.\n\n0:37:59\tSPEAKER_03\n And...\n\n0:38:02\tSPEAKER_02\n For the finishing touch.\n\n0:38:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:05\tSPEAKER_03\n So, could you write, wrote anything down?\n\n0:38:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Could you put it on the shared folder?\n\n0:38:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:38:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:14\tSPEAKER_02\n But...\n\n0:38:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Sebastian has everything.\n\n0:38:17\tSPEAKER_02\n I know, but...\n\n0:38:19\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll put it online.\n\n0:38:22\tNone\n Great.\n\n0:38:25\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:38:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:38:38\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:38:56\tNone\n We have to stay there.\n\n0:38:59\tNone\n Oh.\n\n0:39:02\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:39:06\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:39:09\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:39:10\tNone\n I just followed a...\n\n0:39:12\tNone\n A floor.\n\n0:39:15\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:39:17\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:39:20\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:39:24\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:39:27\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:39:30\tNone\n Hi.\n\n0:39:34\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:39:37\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:39:41\tNone\n Vima, I think the TVA is online.\n\n0:39:43\tNone\n It's a little too late, and I'll go to the door.\n\n0:39:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "SPEAKER, Sebastian, Pierre, Miss Tantal and Jorno are meeting in the control room.
