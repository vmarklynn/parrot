working.\n\n0:00:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:00:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Good afternoon.\n\n0:00:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Good afternoon.\n\n0:00:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:00:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Everybody found this place again?\n\n0:01:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:01:01\tSPEAKER_03\n That's nice.\n\n0:01:04\tSPEAKER_03\n This is our second meeting and still failing.\n\n0:01:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:01:12\tSPEAKER_03\n And now we're going into the functional design.\n\n0:01:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Important thing of this phase is that we're going to try together agreement about the user requirements, technical function design and the working design.\n\n0:01:32\tSPEAKER_03\n So that we can move on to the second phase.\n\n0:01:36\tSPEAKER_03\n But first is phase.\n\n0:01:39\tSPEAKER_03\n First announcement.\n\n0:01:42\tSPEAKER_03\n There's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system.\n\n0:01:46\tSPEAKER_03\n So there's our ghost mouse again.\n\n0:01:52\tSPEAKER_03\n But that means that you can have a little trouble with the air conditioning.\n\n0:01:57\tSPEAKER_03\n That's because of this.\n\n0:02:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:02:01\tSPEAKER_03\n It's in Wing C and E.\n\n0:02:03\tSPEAKER_03\n So it should be over in a while.\n\n0:02:05\tSPEAKER_03\n A couple of days.\n\n0:02:07\tSPEAKER_03\n It's going to be cold anyway.\n\n0:02:10\tSPEAKER_03\n So I don't think you're going to need it.\n\n0:02:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Then our agenda.\n\n0:02:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Now first the opening.\n\n0:02:17\tSPEAKER_03\n This time I will take the minutes.\n\n0:02:19\tSPEAKER_03\n You're going to have a presentation.\n\n0:02:23\tSPEAKER_03\n All of you.\n\n0:02:26\tSPEAKER_03\n And we've got 40 minutes for the whole presentation.\n\n0:02:33\tSPEAKER_03\n So I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation.\n\n0:02:37\tSPEAKER_03\n And then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements, which have been sent to me.\n\n0:02:44\tSPEAKER_03\n And then the decision on the control functions, which we want to include.\n\n0:02:50\tSPEAKER_03\n So we've got 40 minutes for all of it.\n\n0:02:57\tSPEAKER_03\n So I suggest let's start with the first presentation.\n\n0:03:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Who wants to be first?\n\n0:03:04\tSPEAKER_03\n I think I'll go first.\n\n0:03:07\tSPEAKER_03\n So maybe it's easy if you.\n\n0:03:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I think you will tell them your presentation is all which function you have.\n\n0:03:16\tSPEAKER_03\n What are you going to talk about?\n\n0:03:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, my name is Freak from Poland.\n\n0:03:28\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm the market expert, but you already knew that.\n\n0:03:32\tSPEAKER_01\n I've done some research.\n\n0:03:34\tSPEAKER_01\n We have been doing research in a usability lab where we observe users operating remote controls.\n\n0:03:42\tSPEAKER_01\n We let them fill out a questionnaire.\n\n0:03:45\tSPEAKER_01\n We had 100 of these test subjects.\n\n0:03:49\tSPEAKER_01\n In addition, we did some market research.\n\n0:03:52\tSPEAKER_01\n See what the market consists of.\n\n0:03:55\tSPEAKER_01\n What ages are involved?\n\n0:03:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, these are three quite astonishing results, I thought.\n\n0:04:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Remote being considered ugly.\n\n0:04:07\tSPEAKER_01\n 75% of the people question indicated that they thought their remote was ugly.\n\n0:04:14\tSPEAKER_01\n An additional 80% indicated that it would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control.\n\n0:04:21\tSPEAKER_01\n So an addition remote were not very functional.\n\n0:04:26\tSPEAKER_01\n 50% of the people indicated they only used about 10% of the buttons on a remote control.\n\n0:04:33\tSPEAKER_01\n And 50% of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room.\n\n0:04:39\tSPEAKER_01\n So some things.\n\n0:04:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Then we did some research to do most relevant functions.\n\n0:04:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Channel selection and volume selection both got a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 for relevancy.\n\n0:04:55\tSPEAKER_01\n The power button got a 9 and 10 detects got a 6 and a half.\n\n0:05:00\tSPEAKER_01\n So these are the most important functions of a remote control.\n\n0:05:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Then there are some one time use function.\n\n0:05:09\tSPEAKER_01\n That's what I like to call them.\n\n0:05:11\tSPEAKER_01\n They're audio settings, video settings, and channel settings buttons, which are not really used very frequently, but are still considered to be of some importance.\n\n0:05:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently, 168 times per hour.\n\n0:05:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Then these are the, this is the market.\n\n0:05:36\tSPEAKER_01\n 60% of the market consists of users between the ages 16 and 46.\n\n0:05:43\tSPEAKER_01\n The main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on a remote control.\n\n0:05:49\tSPEAKER_01\n They like to use new functions, but they also are very critical.\n\n0:05:54\tSPEAKER_01\n They won't spend their money very easily.\n\n0:05:58\tSPEAKER_01\n The users of 46 to 65 years, they make up 40% of the market.\n\n0:06:04\tSPEAKER_01\n They're not really very interested in features, but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier.\n\n0:06:13\tSPEAKER_01\n What I think this indicates for our design, I think we should make a remote for the future.\n\n0:06:22\tSPEAKER_01\n This means we would have to focus on the ages 16 to 45.\n\n0:06:29\tSPEAKER_01\n This also makes the biggest part of the market, so there will also be where our main profit would be getable.\n\n0:06:40\tSPEAKER_01\n This would mean we would have to make a fancy design.\n\n0:06:45\tSPEAKER_01\n The results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned, thought that remote control caused errors eye.\n\n0:06:57\tSPEAKER_01\n This is certainly something to take into account.\n\n0:07:02\tSPEAKER_01\n 34% thought that it was hard to learn how to operate the new remote control.\n\n0:07:08\tSPEAKER_01\n These are two factors that I think should be included in the design.\n\n0:07:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Besides, of course, the remote must look very nice.\n\n0:07:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Functionality.\n\n0:07:20\tSPEAKER_01\n As a lot of people indicated, they only use about 10% of the buttons.\n\n0:07:24\tSPEAKER_01\n I think we should make very few buttons.\n\n0:07:27\tSPEAKER_01\n This will also be beneficial to the design of the remote.\n\n0:07:33\tSPEAKER_01\n I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasized, especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons, because they are used most.\n\n0:07:43\tSPEAKER_01\n They should be robust.\n\n0:07:45\tSPEAKER_01\n They shouldn't break down easily.\n\n0:07:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Then, as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room, and I say it might be because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot.\n\n0:08:06\tSPEAKER_01\n But it might be a good idea to make a docking station.\n\n0:08:10\tSPEAKER_01\n It could get a button in it, which would send a signal to the remote, which would be unbeap, so you'd know where it is in the room.\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_01\n And in addition to this, it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in.\n\n0:08:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Then, surprisingly, a great deal of people indicated that an LCD screen in the remote control would be preferred.\n\n0:08:36\tSPEAKER_01\n This was mostly people in the age of 16 to 25, but up till 45 it remains feasible.\n\n0:08:47\tSPEAKER_01\n This would also greatly increase the production costs, but I think these are just some small factors we could consider.\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:08:58\tSPEAKER_01\n That would be all.\n\n0:08:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Thank you.\n\n0:09:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Anybody have any questions?\n\n0:09:06\tSPEAKER_03\n About functional requirements?\n\n0:09:07\tSPEAKER_03\n No.\n\n0:09:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, that's clear.\n\n0:09:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Add to the second.\n\n0:09:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:09:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Up and down, could you add that?\n\n0:09:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Usually interface, of it.\n\n0:09:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, you can take your time.\n\n0:09:35\tSPEAKER_03\n We've got plenty of time.\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_00\n That's a bit of a slideshow.\n\n0:09:46\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we use the general functions of the remote control.\n\n0:09:57\tSPEAKER_00\n During a little research on the internet, we're not much information about it.\n\n0:10:05\tSPEAKER_00\n About the interface.\n\n0:10:11\tSPEAKER_00\n I've been thinking about simple manner to put a lot of functions in one remote control.\n\n0:10:21\tSPEAKER_00\n You've got a lot of devices like DVD, television, stereo.\n\n0:10:29\tSPEAKER_00\n But it must be user-friendly.\n\n0:10:32\tSPEAKER_00\n So you can put a lot of functions in one remote control.\n\n0:10:44\tSPEAKER_00\n But yeah.\n\n0:10:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:53\tSPEAKER_00\n I've got many functions in one remote control.\n\n0:11:03\tSPEAKER_00\n But yeah, you can see this is quite simple remote control.\n\n0:11:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Fewer buttons.\n\n0:11:11\tSPEAKER_00\n But this remote control.\n\n0:11:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Got a lot of buttons.\n\n0:11:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:17\tSPEAKER_00\n People don't like it.\n\n0:11:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Keep the general functions like they are.\n\n0:11:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Like the on-off button.\n\n0:11:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Like a red button.\n\n0:11:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Everybody knows it.\n\n0:11:33\tSPEAKER_00\n You don't have to change that.\n\n0:11:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Personal preferences.\n\n0:11:41\tSPEAKER_00\n You use a display for specific functions of the different device.\n\n0:11:48\tSPEAKER_00\n So what I was thinking about was.\n\n0:11:53\tSPEAKER_00\n You got a remote control.\n\n0:12:09\tSPEAKER_00\n You got a general functions like the on-off button.\n\n0:12:16\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:12:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Here you got this kind of display.\n\n0:12:22\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a touch screen.\n\n0:12:26\tSPEAKER_00\n You got a general functions of the device for a DVD player.\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_00\n For a player, a reverse, etc.\n\n0:12:40\tSPEAKER_00\n You got a real buttons for selecting a device.\n\n0:12:45\tSPEAKER_00\n So this button is for DVD or...\n\n0:12:50\tSPEAKER_00\n So for every device you got a part display of a part of a button.\n\n0:13:00\tSPEAKER_00\n You never got all the buttons on one device.\n\n0:13:06\tSPEAKER_00\n That's my idea about it.\n\n0:13:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:13:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's see.\n\n0:13:17\tSPEAKER_00\n So touch screen.\n\n0:13:19\tSPEAKER_00\n The real buttons we have to use.\n\n0:13:23\tSPEAKER_00\n We better use quite large buttons for everybody.\n\n0:13:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Everybody after you see it.\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_00\n So, all people, young people.\n\n0:13:36\tSPEAKER_00\n So we must keep buttons quite simple and quite large.\n\n0:13:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:47\tSPEAKER_00\n It was my part of it.\n\n0:13:52\tSPEAKER_03\n There are questions about technical functions.\n\n0:13:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you think if we're going to use a touch screen, we're going to go way above the 12.5 euros?\n\n0:14:03\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't think so.\n\n0:14:05\tSPEAKER_00\n You got quite cheap touch screens.\n\n0:14:08\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not in color or something.\n\n0:14:11\tSPEAKER_00\n It's just one color.\n\n0:14:18\tSPEAKER_00\n I've seen something on the internet, not today, a few weeks ago.\n\n0:14:27\tSPEAKER_00\n You got quite a kind of touch screen.\n\n0:14:33\tSPEAKER_00\n For 20 euros or less.\n\n0:14:42\tSPEAKER_00\n So it's possible.\n\n0:14:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we certainly make a fancy design.\n\n0:14:49\tSPEAKER_02\n But it wouldn't be very robust.\n\n0:14:52\tSPEAKER_02\n It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it.\n\n0:14:55\tSPEAKER_01\n That is true.\n\n0:14:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe you can first listen to your presentation.\n\n0:15:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Then we have a little discussion about the requirements.\n\n0:15:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Design.\n\n0:15:12\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it's going to.\n\n0:15:21\tSPEAKER_02\n OK, I've got a presentation about the working design.\n\n0:15:28\tSPEAKER_02\n First about how it works.\n\n0:15:30\tSPEAKER_02\n It's really simple.\n\n0:15:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Of course, everybody knows how remote works.\n\n0:15:33\tSPEAKER_02\n The user presses a button.\n\n0:15:35\tSPEAKER_02\n They remote determines what button it is.\n\n0:15:37\tSPEAKER_02\n It uses the infrared to send the signal to the TV.\n\n0:15:40\tSPEAKER_02\n The TV switches to the frequency or what function it is.\n\n0:15:44\tSPEAKER_02\n So we've got the plate.\n\n0:15:49\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a interactive disk for every button.\n\n0:15:52\tSPEAKER_02\n When the user presses a button, the signal goes to the LED and transmits it to the TV.\n\n0:16:00\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a very simple device, technically speaking.\n\n0:16:03\tSPEAKER_02\n So this is a schematic overview.\n\n0:16:06\tSPEAKER_02\n You've got the buttons, the power source.\n\n0:16:10\tSPEAKER_02\n When the button gets pressed, it goes to the chip.\n\n0:16:15\tSPEAKER_02\n It controls the infrared bulb and perhaps a normal bulb.\n\n0:16:20\tSPEAKER_02\n When you press a button, you can actually see your pressed button.\n\n0:16:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I think we should use default materials, simple plastics.\n\n0:16:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Keep the inner working simple so it's robust.\n\n0:16:34\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we should focus on aesthetics, the design, and the user interface, because if you're going to use high-tech materials, the price is going to go sky high.\n\n0:16:44\tSPEAKER_02\n You only have to design a remote once, and if you use high-tech materials, it comes back in every product.\n\n0:16:51\tSPEAKER_02\n So in my idea, it's going to be smart to invest in design and not in the product itself.\n\n0:17:01\tSPEAKER_02\n That's it.\n\n0:17:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, thank you.\n\n0:17:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:17:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now.\n\n0:17:29\tSPEAKER_03\n I am the project manager, so I'm here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements.\n\n0:17:38\tSPEAKER_03\n We've got to design a remote which is only suitable for TV.\n\n0:17:47\tSPEAKER_03\n That's because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big.\n\n0:17:54\tSPEAKER_03\n If we want to have it for more functions, so it has to be simple.\n\n0:18:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Another point is we have to skip the data text because in the world of upcoming internet, we think the data text is going to be a thing of the past.\n\n0:18:15\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a function we don't need in our remote control.\n\n0:18:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Internet is also mentioned just to go in a function we can use, maybe also on televisions that will be available as well.\n\n0:18:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Another one is the customer is 40 plus.\n\n0:18:36\tSPEAKER_03\n That's the market we have to target because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers.\n\n0:18:47\tSPEAKER_03\n This is a bit pity for the marketing expert because he was aiming on the younger persons.\n\n0:18:56\tSPEAKER_03\n We have to find a market which is above 40 plus but we will suit our remote control and the other way around.\n\n0:19:06\tSPEAKER_03\n We have to be very attentive in putting the corporate image in our product.\n\n0:19:14\tSPEAKER_03\n It has to be visible in our design in the way our device works.\n\n0:19:21\tSPEAKER_03\n We have to be very clear on this point as well.\n\n0:19:25\tSPEAKER_03\n I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions.\n\n0:19:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Is there any discussion possible about the requirements?\n\n0:19:38\tSPEAKER_03\n We can see if we can find a way between the functions we want to use and the market we want to reach with our products.\n\n0:19:49\tSPEAKER_01\n We are saying that Teletex is going to be an old feature and it's not going to be used any more anyway.\n\n0:19:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Pretty soon new TVs will have internet access on them.\n\n0:20:01\tSPEAKER_01\n If you are targeting people of 40 plus, the chance that they will have a TV with internet access within the next 20 years is very slim.\n\n0:20:13\tSPEAKER_01\n In addition, people indicated that Teletex was an important feature for the remote control.\n\n0:20:20\tSPEAKER_01\n So I think it's pretty dumb to put no Teletex feature on it.\n\n0:20:26\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm pretty much against it.\n\n0:20:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Against the no-deletex.\n\n0:20:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Besides that, I think the market for 40 plus is pretty small.\n\n0:20:42\tSPEAKER_01\n But I think we are just going to go for another step.\n\n0:20:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Pretty.\n\n0:20:52\tSPEAKER_03\n I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which are also mentioned.\n\n0:21:02\tSPEAKER_03\n If we put a lot of effort in those, we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons or just three modes which is suitable for the market we want to reach because it is 40% of the market.\n\n0:21:16\tSPEAKER_03\n If you look in Holland, the whole generation of 40 plus, 50 plus, it's the biggest share of the whole population now.\n\n0:21:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, but it's not the biggest part of the market.\n\n0:21:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Besides that, they're not very critical.\n\n0:21:40\tSPEAKER_01\n What the remote control is like.\n\n0:21:42\tSPEAKER_01\n It will just take the first thing I see which looks acceptable.\n\n0:21:48\tSPEAKER_03\n But don't you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market, the people think from the people think that's the device I've looked for.\n\n0:22:02\tSPEAKER_03\n I didn't realize it, so let's try it.\n\n0:22:07\tSPEAKER_01\n I think that would be the case in 16 to 45 ages category.\n\n0:22:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Because they are critical and they want to have a fancy remote control.\n\n0:22:21\tSPEAKER_01\n People are 40 plus.\n\n0:22:23\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, they want it to work but as soon as it works, it's okay with them.\n\n0:22:31\tSPEAKER_02\n I think that if we put our marketing right, we can sell this just like, I don't know if you've heard about it in the news, the elderly mobile phone.\n\n0:22:42\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a big success.\n\n0:22:44\tSPEAKER_02\n If we make a remote control, just with that idea in mind, we could make tons of money.\n\n0:22:51\tSPEAKER_02\n We don't have to focus on the design then but on functionality.\n\n0:22:58\tSPEAKER_02\n We just change our focus on the project.\n\n0:23:02\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we can sell this.\n\n0:23:07\tSPEAKER_03\n I simply think that the new products we're going to make specifically designed are designed for younger people.\n\n0:23:22\tSPEAKER_03\n So maybe we can focus ourselves on the elderly people.\n\n0:23:29\tSPEAKER_03\n I think we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls.\n\n0:23:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Because what you told is the channel selection is important.\n\n0:23:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Volume selection, power and tailored text.\n\n0:23:49\tSPEAKER_01\n But obviously the board tends to disagree.\n\n0:23:52\tSPEAKER_03\n No, we haven't voted yet.\n\n0:23:56\tSPEAKER_03\n I think tailored text can be a function as well.\n\n0:24:04\tSPEAKER_03\n But only if you don't hire the cost.\n\n0:24:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement tailored text as well.\n\n0:24:15\tSPEAKER_03\n So I think that there will be a problem.\n\n0:24:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Or is tailored text.\n\n0:24:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Definitely a bad idea not to include it.\n\n0:24:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Is anybody really against tailored text?\n\n0:24:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Let's just keep the tailored text.\n\n0:24:41\tSPEAKER_03\n I think that's a good idea as well, especially for the subtitles.\n\n0:24:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe we can make that another point of advantage in our remote control.\n\n0:24:56\tSPEAKER_03\n If we make a button, for example, for big subtitles, which is instantly on the remote control for elderly people that they can think, why I want to have subtitles and push the button and they get the big subtitles.\n\n0:25:12\tSPEAKER_03\n That's a good idea.\n\n0:25:15\tSPEAKER_03\n So I think that text can be very useful in our advantage.\n\n0:25:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Functionality should be few buttons, you said?\n\n0:25:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:25:28\tSPEAKER_03\n I think that's very important.\n\n0:25:31\tSPEAKER_03\n We have a few buttons.\n\n0:25:34\tSPEAKER_03\n So it's a good button.\n\n0:25:37\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't think it's really an issue anymore.\n\n0:25:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, it might be.\n\n0:25:44\tSPEAKER_01\n If it's only for TV, you're not going to need a lot of buttons anyway.\n\n0:25:48\tSPEAKER_01\n We need one to zero button, next channel, previous channel, volume up, volume down.\n\n0:25:55\tSPEAKER_01\n And some tailored text buttons.\n\n0:25:59\tSPEAKER_03\n But do you need the buttons for one to zero?\n\n0:26:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe we can...\n\n0:26:14\tSPEAKER_01\n I think many people like to use that.\n\n0:26:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe we can use...\n\n0:26:19\tSPEAKER_01\n I want to switch from channel one to like 35.\n\n0:26:22\tSPEAKER_01\n You know when I push the next channel button 35 times.\n\n0:26:25\tSPEAKER_03\n I can implement the scroll button or joystick.\n\n0:26:32\tSPEAKER_03\n There are other ways to...\n\n0:26:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Just look, if you look at telephones, the Sony Telephone and the scroll button, which is very useful in searching names or...\n\n0:26:42\tSPEAKER_01\n That is true, but...\n\n0:26:46\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't think there are many TVs that can switch channels that fast.\n\n0:26:50\tSPEAKER_01\n So you would need like...\n\n0:26:55\tSPEAKER_01\n A function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it.\n\n0:27:00\tSPEAKER_01\n And I don't know if many channels do have that.\n\n0:27:05\tSPEAKER_02\n If any TVs have that.\n\n0:27:07\tSPEAKER_02\n And besides that, if we're going to focus on elderly people, they'll have to adapt.\n\n0:27:12\tSPEAKER_02\n They're not used to using scroll buttons.\n\n0:27:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Perhaps we should stick to the basic layout.\n\n0:27:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, there are numbers.\n\n0:27:22\tSPEAKER_03\n We can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display.\n\n0:27:26\tSPEAKER_03\n And if it's too much, we can reconsider it.\n\n0:27:30\tSPEAKER_03\n But I think there won't be very much buttons.\n\n0:27:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Or there don't have to be...\n\n0:27:35\tSPEAKER_01\n I think if you're going to make remote control only to operate a TV, there's not much you can gain on...\n\n0:27:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Having as few buttons as possible.\n\n0:27:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Because I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a TV, which already only have the minimum number of buttons.\n\n0:27:53\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't think there's much to be gained in that area.\n\n0:27:56\tSPEAKER_03\n The number of buttons.\n\n0:27:58\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it's very important in the design.\n\n0:28:02\tSPEAKER_03\n You can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places.\n\n0:28:07\tSPEAKER_03\n If you have less buttons, you can do a lot more with it.\n\n0:28:11\tSPEAKER_01\n That's true, but I think there's not much to gain on the competition when you're making a remote control only to operate only the TV.\n\n0:28:21\tSPEAKER_01\n If you have a remote control only to operate a TV, there's not a lot of buttons required.\n\n0:28:29\tSPEAKER_01\n There's not a lot of functions required.\n\n0:28:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either.\n\n0:28:37\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here.\n\n0:28:42\tSPEAKER_01\n We can...\n\n0:28:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Note costs a big marketing expedition.\n\n0:28:49\tSPEAKER_01\n That's right.\n\n0:28:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Which was one of the arguments to make it only for the TV because we didn't have the time to market a lot.\n\n0:28:57\tSPEAKER_03\n You should just focus on, for example, the docking station, like other functions.\n\n0:29:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Instead of less buttons.\n\n0:29:12\tSPEAKER_01\n I think we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons.\n\n0:29:18\tSPEAKER_01\n But I don't think we should spend very much time in that.\n\n0:29:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Do you think the docking station is allowed in the budget we have?\n\n0:29:31\tSPEAKER_02\n It should be possible, yes.\n\n0:29:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Because it's not too fancy.\n\n0:29:35\tSPEAKER_02\n And if the remote stays rather small, it should be possible.\n\n0:29:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Because I think that's a good advantage point as well.\n\n0:29:44\tSPEAKER_03\n If we have a fancy looking docking station or...\n\n0:29:48\tSPEAKER_03\n That's a nice requirement for the docking station.\n\n0:29:56\tSPEAKER_02\n So we're just going to focus on the extras.\n\n0:29:59\tSPEAKER_03\n I think so.\n\n0:30:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I think maybe we should do some research into what other people like to have in a...\n\n0:30:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, like to have extra and in remote control.\n\n0:30:10\tSPEAKER_03\n That's a good point.\n\n0:30:13\tSPEAKER_03\n You said they easily get lost as well?\n\n0:30:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, well, 50% of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost.\n\n0:30:24\tSPEAKER_03\n So maybe we should implement the audio side or something.\n\n0:30:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that was what I suggested.\n\n0:30:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Like with your keychain, if you were to show it goes.\n\n0:30:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it makes a sound.\n\n0:30:35\tSPEAKER_01\n You have some phones too.\n\n0:30:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Do you have a docking station?\n\n0:30:39\tSPEAKER_01\n You just press a button and the phone goes ringing.\n\n0:30:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, so...\n\n0:30:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Audio signal should be possible as well.\n\n0:30:47\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it's not too expensive.\n\n0:30:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Another point is the LCD screen.\n\n0:30:59\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know if that will rise to cost too much.\n\n0:31:06\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen because...\n\n0:31:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, it's a little bit too much.\n\n0:31:12\tSPEAKER_01\n I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices, it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it which will explain a button if you press it which would tell you what it does.\n\n0:31:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:32\tSPEAKER_01\n And it wouldn't have to be touch screen or expensive screen but...\n\n0:31:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Just the LCD or just the normal screen.\n\n0:31:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Just a screen ID.\n\n0:31:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Some extra info.\n\n0:31:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Feedback.\n\n0:31:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I think that's a good idea as well.\n\n0:31:51\tSPEAKER_01\n But I don't know if that would...\n\n0:31:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Is this small screen fit into the...\n\n0:31:59\tSPEAKER_01\n cost...\n\n0:32:03\tSPEAKER_03\n extra button info.\n\n0:32:07\tSPEAKER_03\n I think that should be possible as well.\n\n0:32:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Let's see what did we say...\n\n0:32:17\tSPEAKER_03\n More.\n\n0:32:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Should be fancy to design.\n\n0:32:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Is it to learn?\n\n0:32:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Few buttons.\n\n0:32:23\tSPEAKER_03\n We talked about that.\n\n0:32:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Talking Station LCD.\n\n0:32:29\tSPEAKER_03\n General functions.\n\n0:32:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:32:40\tSPEAKER_03\n And default materials.\n\n0:32:44\tSPEAKER_03\n I think that's a good idea as well because...\n\n0:32:48\tSPEAKER_03\n So don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one.\n\n0:32:54\tSPEAKER_03\n So it doesn't really matter.\n\n0:32:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls and youngsters.\n\n0:33:08\tSPEAKER_03\n And let's specify the target group.\n\n0:33:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from 40 to...\n\n0:33:17\tSPEAKER_03\n 80 because I think what we're going to design now is for people above 60.\n\n0:33:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe.\n\n0:33:29\tSPEAKER_03\n What do we want?\n\n0:33:31\tSPEAKER_03\n If we want to...\n\n0:33:33\tSPEAKER_03\n profil it as with...\n\n0:33:35\tSPEAKER_03\n For example, the telephone for elderly people.\n\n0:33:38\tSPEAKER_03\n We can target the real elderly people.\n\n0:33:43\tSPEAKER_01\n I think that would be...\n\n0:33:45\tSPEAKER_01\n If we should do something like that, it would be...\n\n0:33:48\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it would be really good for the image of the company.\n\n0:33:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:54\tSPEAKER_01\n And I think there would be a good market for it.\n\n0:33:57\tSPEAKER_01\n So that's the...\n\n0:34:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Really bring an innovative product.\n\n0:34:02\tSPEAKER_03\n You're talking about 60 to 80, for example.\n\n0:34:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:06\tSPEAKER_03\n The really...\n\n0:34:08\tSPEAKER_03\n About 60.\n\n0:34:10\tSPEAKER_01\n I'd have to look into that a little more.\n\n0:34:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay. And different cultures.\n\n0:34:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Are we?\n\n0:34:17\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think they have different television sets in every country.\n\n0:34:23\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:34:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:34:27\tSPEAKER_03\n You've got five minutes left.\n\n0:34:29\tSPEAKER_03\n It's small work.\n\n0:34:30\tSPEAKER_01\n And with the little screen in it, which explains the buttons, I think it would be a lot easier to adapt to different cultures.\n\n0:34:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah. In different languages.\n\n0:34:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Or you have to put a language button in it, but that will be a bit unnecessary, I think.\n\n0:34:50\tSPEAKER_03\n It's better to put it on different markets with...\n\n0:34:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:34:55\tSPEAKER_03\n So that's the target.\n\n0:34:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Then a few small things.\n\n0:35:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:35:07\tSPEAKER_03\n I will put the minutes in the project document folder.\n\n0:35:13\tSPEAKER_03\n What we're going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept.\n\n0:35:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Use the interface design and the user interface concept and the trend watching.\n\n0:35:24\tSPEAKER_03\n So just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group requirements and the trends, which we're going on.\n\n0:35:34\tSPEAKER_03\n And the specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach.\n\n0:35:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:35:41\tSPEAKER_03\n So I thank you for this meeting.\n\n0:35:43\tSPEAKER_03\n And I think we have a lunch break now.\n\n0:35:46\tSPEAKER_00\n That's good.\n\n0:35:47\tSPEAKER_03\n So that's a good thing.\n\n0:36:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Now we're not allowed to talk about it.\n\n0:36:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Thank you.\n\n0:36:27\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:36:37\tNone\n Okay.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "SPEAKER and his colleagues are having a meeting.
