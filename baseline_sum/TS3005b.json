Good.\n\n0:01:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's see what we can find here.\n\n0:01:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:01:36\tSPEAKER_00\n A very warm welcome again to everyone.\n\n0:01:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Here we are already in our functional design meeting.\n\n0:01:44\tSPEAKER_00\n This is what we are going to do, the opening, which we are doing now.\n\n0:01:49\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm a project manager, but on the meetings I'm also the secretary, which means I will make minutes as I did at the previous meeting.\n\n0:01:58\tSPEAKER_00\n I also put these as fast as possible in the project folder, so you can see them and review what we have discussed.\n\n0:02:06\tSPEAKER_00\n If I'm right, there are three presentations.\n\n0:02:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Each one of you is prepared.\n\n0:02:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Good.\n\n0:02:14\tSPEAKER_00\n We will also take a look at new project requirements, if you haven't heard about them yet.\n\n0:02:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Then we have to take a decision on the remote control functions, and we have some more time, 40 minutes, but I think we will need it.\n\n0:02:29\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know who wants to go first with this presentation.\n\n0:02:34\tSPEAKER_04\n Shall I go first?\n\n0:02:36\tSPEAKER_04\n Shall I go first with the user?\n\n0:02:39\tSPEAKER_04\n I think you are not going to go first.\n\n0:02:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Is there an order?\n\n0:02:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, it's presentation.\n\n0:02:45\tSPEAKER_00\n You can adjust it.\n\n0:02:48\tSPEAKER_00\n One question, your name, Denny?\n\n0:02:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Is it with AEA?\n\n0:02:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Thank you.\n\n0:02:57\tSPEAKER_03\n I wanted to explain the work and design of a remote control.\n\n0:03:02\tSPEAKER_03\n It's possible if you are handy if you want to design one of those.\n\n0:03:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Basically, it works as I wrote down in this little summary.\n\n0:03:15\tSPEAKER_03\n When you press a button, that's when you do, for example, when you want to turn up the volume, a little connection is made.\n\n0:03:24\tSPEAKER_03\n The rubber button just presses on a little pin plate, which makes a connection that gives the chips, which is mounted beneath that plastic rubber button, a sense that connection has been made, and knows what button you pressed, for example, the volume up or volume down button.\n\n0:03:51\tSPEAKER_03\n The chip makes a Morse code like signal, which then is signals to several transistors, which sends the signal to a little lat.\n\n0:04:08\tSPEAKER_03\n You know what a lat is?\n\n0:04:10\tSPEAKER_03\n That makes the infrared light signal, which is sent to the television set, which has a sensor in it to send the signal of the infrared.\n\n0:04:24\tSPEAKER_03\n That's basically how it works.\n\n0:04:28\tSPEAKER_03\n The findings that I found searching up some detail information about remote controls are that they are very easy to produce.\n\n0:04:39\tSPEAKER_03\n It's possible to make them a mass production, because this is as easy as printing a page, just a fiberglass plate.\n\n0:04:51\tSPEAKER_03\n It's covered with some coatings and chips.\n\n0:04:59\tSPEAKER_03\n The technology is already available.\n\n0:05:01\tSPEAKER_03\n We don't have to find out how remote controls have to work, or how to make some chips that are possible to transmit those signals.\n\n0:05:14\tSPEAKER_03\n I made a little animation.\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_03\n How I turned the remote control works.\n\n0:05:26\tSPEAKER_01\n There is something to it.\n\n0:05:30\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a little bug in the smartboard.\n\n0:05:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, the subcomponent I suppose that you understand what subcomponent is.\n\n0:05:38\tSPEAKER_03\n In this example, it's the button.\n\n0:05:41\tSPEAKER_03\n When it is pressed down, the switch is switched on, so the wire is sent to the chip in cooperation with the battery, of course, because to make a signal possible, you have to have some electronic infrared light.\n\n0:06:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes?\n\n0:06:05\tSPEAKER_03\n After it's being composed by the chip, the signal is transported to the infrared bulb.\n\n0:06:13\tSPEAKER_03\n From there, it signals a more-scode-like signal to the bulb in the television set.\n\n0:06:24\tSPEAKER_03\n I wrote down some personal preferences about the remote control.\n\n0:06:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Of course, it is very handy if the remote control is handheld, so you don't have to wind it up or something, it's very light to use it.\n\n0:06:41\tSPEAKER_03\n I personally prefer that it would become available in various colors.\n\n0:06:48\tSPEAKER_03\n And easy to use buttons, but I suppose that the other team members thought of that too.\n\n0:06:56\tSPEAKER_03\n And it is possible for several designs.\n\n0:07:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Easy to use buttons.\n\n0:07:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Perhaps soft touch screen buttons, because the rubber buttons are always slightly damaged, so the numbers on the buttons are not possible to read anymore.\n\n0:07:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Before we can make several designs.\n\n0:07:22\tSPEAKER_03\n That's my contribution to this meeting.\n\n0:07:26\tSPEAKER_00\n This meeting.\n\n0:07:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, please.\n\n0:07:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, my name is Im Kriong, and I looked at the technical functions design of the remote.\n\n0:07:47\tSPEAKER_01\n I did this by looking at examples of other remote controls, of how they look and information from the web that I found.\n\n0:07:56\tSPEAKER_01\n What I found was that the actual use of remote control is to send messages to the television set, how you describe it.\n\n0:08:06\tSPEAKER_01\n And it can be all sorts of messages, turn it on, turn it off, change the channel, just fill in with kind of thing, play video text, but also play CD if you use your CD player.\n\n0:08:20\tSPEAKER_01\n There are some examples of remote controls.\n\n0:08:25\tSPEAKER_01\n You can see they are very different.\n\n0:08:27\tSPEAKER_01\n The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and a lot of buttons, etc.\n\n0:08:33\tSPEAKER_01\n And the other is more user friendly, little with big buttons, and not all the stuff you can do with it, but the essential stuff is there.\n\n0:08:46\tSPEAKER_01\n I guess you could better, you should look at the user centered approach because the customers have to use them.\n\n0:08:55\tSPEAKER_01\n And if they don't think it's usable, they want to buy it.\n\n0:08:59\tSPEAKER_01\n A lot of buttons they may think from, I don't meet as much as that.\n\n0:09:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, personal preference is a simple remote with the basic functions that you can need.\n\n0:09:11\tSPEAKER_01\n You could use.\n\n0:09:13\tSPEAKER_01\n But keep in mind the new functions of TV, what we discussed earlier, split screen, and is that a function that you should have with all the TVs you have them, or because only a few of them isn't really necessary.\n\n0:09:25\tSPEAKER_01\n And then I would make sure that you could use it on more than one appliance.\n\n0:09:32\tSPEAKER_01\n If you have one that does the video, it could also work with the stereo, because play is play and stop, stop, and everything.\n\n0:09:43\tSPEAKER_01\n You could reuse the buttons, so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for anything.\n\n0:09:48\tSPEAKER_01\n And it should be user friendly, clear buttons, and not too much.\n\n0:09:53\tSPEAKER_01\n And that's my presentation.\n\n0:09:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, I'll hear you.\n\n0:09:58\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:10:00\tSPEAKER_04\n Check.\n\n0:10:11\tSPEAKER_01\n You must still have to open.\n\n0:10:15\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:10:23\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:10:24\tSPEAKER_04\n So, we're going to discuss the functional requirements of the remote.\n\n0:10:29\tSPEAKER_04\n That means that functions user want to have on the remote control, or just, yeah, the user's actually.\n\n0:10:39\tSPEAKER_04\n The medit, I prefer, is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus more, are the younger people going to buy remote control, or the elderly people, and that section we're going to focus, and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section.\n\n0:11:02\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:11:03\tSPEAKER_04\n Some data.\n\n0:11:04\tSPEAKER_04\n Younger people from six and four, four, five years are more interested in features, like LCD screen speech recognition, et cetera.\n\n0:11:14\tSPEAKER_04\n And we process about two-third of the market from in that range of age.\n\n0:11:21\tSPEAKER_04\n The elderly people from 45 years to 65 years are not that much interested in features, and we process less than two-third, that's two-fifth of the market share in that area.\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:11:40\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:11:41\tSPEAKER_04\n Finings.\n\n0:11:42\tSPEAKER_04\n 50% of the users lose their remote often, so we don't have to make very small, like a mobile phone or something, but somewhat bigger than small, so you don't lose it that much anymore.\n\n0:11:55\tSPEAKER_04\n 75% of the users also find it ugly, and 75% of the users have a lot.\n\n0:12:02\tSPEAKER_04\n So the buttons should be that small, or should be that complex, because you have to search for the buttons, which one you're going to use.\n\n0:12:12\tSPEAKER_04\n Important issues about the remote.\n\n0:12:14\tSPEAKER_04\n I think this would be better with the personal reference, but okay.\n\n0:12:18\tSPEAKER_04\n Remote control has to have a low power usage, because 75% of the users only set one time an hour, so the power usage is also one time an hour, so with a high power usage, we would use a lot of batteries.\n\n0:12:37\tSPEAKER_04\n The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control, so those have to be find very easily, and have to be somewhat like bigger, et cetera.\n\n0:12:50\tSPEAKER_04\n It has also to be, I have to find easily when the label is gone.\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_04\n My colleague also announced that the label should be scratched off, or who is off-gust later.\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_04\n So if that's the problem, you also have to find it easily on the remote.\n\n0:13:12\tSPEAKER_04\n Buttons, like what our colleague said, have to be minimalized, or should be covered, or in the LCD screen.\n\n0:13:22\tSPEAKER_04\n The LCD screen is easy, because you have the LCD screen.\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_04\n You have the various options, put one option, and then you have all the buttons of that option, so the other options will be gone, and you don't see the buttons.\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_04\n So LCD screen should be easy, but an LCD screen, the problem with the LCD screen is that elderly people from 65 years don't use the LCD screen a lot.\n\n0:13:44\tSPEAKER_04\n So we have to keep that in mind, that if you're going to implement the LCD screen, don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use.\n\n0:13:52\tSPEAKER_03\n LCD screen as in touch screen.\n\n0:13:55\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, touch screen.\n\n0:13:57\tSPEAKER_04\n The last, but at least, younger people are more critical about the features, because they use the remote control often more often, and are more technical than all the people, and all the people spend more money, and easily on the remote control.\n\n0:14:12\tSPEAKER_04\n So we have to keep in mind to focus not that much on the younger people, but also somewhat on the elderly people.\n\n0:14:22\tSPEAKER_04\n And our personal references, I don't have any more time to come with that, but like I said, LCD screen is easily to use, because you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote, with not that much buttons, and it should be used to use, especially the following buttons, the channel buttons, and the number buttons to set through the channels.\n\n0:14:44\tSPEAKER_04\n And that is it.\n\n0:14:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, okay.\n\n0:14:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, thank you all, huh?\n\n0:14:52\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:14:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Did everyone receive an email with the new project requirements?\n\n0:14:57\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:14:58\tSPEAKER_00\n No?\n\n0:14:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, I did not.\n\n0:15:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Can you perhaps hear us?\n\n0:15:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them, so you can all read them.\n\n0:15:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, well, not in this presentation.\n\n0:15:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Hmm.\n\n0:15:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Should be in there.\n\n0:15:13\tSPEAKER_00\n I can tell you them from my laptop.\n\n0:15:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Teletect has become outdated since the popularity of the internet.\n\n0:15:22\tSPEAKER_00\n So that's the first thing we, I think, we should pay less attention to the teletect.\n\n0:15:27\tSPEAKER_00\n The remote control should only be used for the television, otherwise the project becomes more complex, which, in danger, is the time to market, and of course, we'll make it more costly, I think.\n\n0:15:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Our current customers are within the age group of 40 plus.\n\n0:15:40\tSPEAKER_00\n New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than 40, and you talked about that before.\n\n0:15:46\tSPEAKER_00\n And a last point, but also very important, our corporate image should stay recognizable in our products, which means that our corporate color and slogan must be implemented in the new design.\n\n0:15:57\tSPEAKER_00\n So we have to keep that in mind.\n\n0:16:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, according to our agenda, it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions.\n\n0:16:08\tSPEAKER_00\n So who has any idea what should be on it and what shouldn't?\n\n0:16:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, you said that you should only...\n\n0:16:17\tSPEAKER_01\n With one appliance, or with one, did you say only the TV?\n\n0:16:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, only the video also, or not.\n\n0:16:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, it's only for television here.\n\n0:16:27\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:16:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:16:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Next is a lot easier.\n\n0:16:31\tSPEAKER_04\n So yeah, then you can...\n\n0:16:34\tSPEAKER_04\n Requirements.\n\n0:16:35\tSPEAKER_04\n No, functions.\n\n0:16:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Then you should have the on-off.\n\n0:16:39\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, based on volume channel, one till two zero numbers on it.\n\n0:16:46\tSPEAKER_04\n And the text doesn't have to be.\n\n0:16:48\tSPEAKER_04\n No.\n\n0:16:49\tSPEAKER_04\n Other phone.\n\n0:16:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I had...\n\n0:16:53\tSPEAKER_01\n You can say from one number to two numbers.\n\n0:16:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:57\tSPEAKER_01\n No, no, no.\n\n0:16:58\tSPEAKER_04\n I think it's easy to implement, but with what, especially do that, because some TVs, if you press this one and then the two, between five, six, you make twelve.\n\n0:17:11\tSPEAKER_04\n And that means that's relaxed.\n\n0:17:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Relax.\n\n0:17:15\tSPEAKER_03\n And there are some models that don't accommodate that function.\n\n0:17:21\tSPEAKER_03\n So the Phillips television makes possible, and that indeed to press one and then two to make a...\n\n0:17:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Easy to reach, 10, 12.\n\n0:17:29\tSPEAKER_03\n But all the television makes use of those, and when you first press that button, and then press two digits to...\n\n0:17:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, so you have that one.\n\n0:17:39\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, thank you.\n\n0:17:40\tSPEAKER_04\n All main targets.\n\n0:17:41\tSPEAKER_04\n HR?\n\n0:17:42\tSPEAKER_04\n We're 45 plus or...\n\n0:17:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, new products should reach a market with customers that are younger than 40.\n\n0:17:48\tSPEAKER_00\n And now we have...\n\n0:17:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, because...\n\n0:17:50\tSPEAKER_04\n 40 plus.\n\n0:17:51\tSPEAKER_04\n Because younger people...\n\n0:17:54\tSPEAKER_04\n Younger people have...\n\n0:17:56\tSPEAKER_04\n Now, 16 to 25...\n\n0:17:58\tSPEAKER_04\n H are 81% interested in LCD screen.\n\n0:18:03\tSPEAKER_04\n From 26 to 35 to 66%, and 36 to 45 to 55%.\n\n0:18:08\tSPEAKER_04\n So I think to...\n\n0:18:12\tSPEAKER_04\n Because on most remote controls, the print plate will be broken in about two years.\n\n0:18:17\tSPEAKER_04\n You have to press very hard to go to the next set with the LCD screens easier, because you only have to wipe the screen for the fingerprint.\n\n0:18:25\tSPEAKER_03\n And then you can use that.\n\n0:18:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that collides with our mission to make it fair cheap.\n\n0:18:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, because the LCD screen is very expensive.\n\n0:18:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but the touchscreen...\n\n0:18:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but the touchscreen probably even more.\n\n0:18:37\tSPEAKER_03\n True.\n\n0:18:38\tSPEAKER_03\n True.\n\n0:18:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Well...\n\n0:18:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, it's possible to make an LCD screen.\n\n0:18:47\tSPEAKER_03\n How was the information?\n\n0:18:49\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, it only says that this percentage is like LCD screen, because it says that younger age between 16 and 45, highly interested features more critical.\n\n0:19:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Because perhaps we should focus on the LCD screen.\n\n0:19:06\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, because our target is 16 to 45.\n\n0:19:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but we will not...\n\n0:19:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Exceed our...\n\n0:19:15\tSPEAKER_03\n We don't know how much it costs.\n\n0:19:17\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, you don't know how much it costs, LCD screen.\n\n0:19:19\tSPEAKER_04\n Is it possible to find out?\n\n0:19:20\tSPEAKER_04\n No, I don't have any costs here. I only have percentages.\n\n0:19:24\tSPEAKER_01\n What if you would do an LCD screen?\n\n0:19:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Do we have...\n\n0:19:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Don't you have any buttons?\n\n0:19:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Or because it's only direct at the TV.\n\n0:19:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Then you only have...\n\n0:19:33\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know what you want to...\n\n0:19:34\tSPEAKER_03\n No, an LCD screen is just like a drone here.\n\n0:19:37\tSPEAKER_03\n It just displays several buttons.\n\n0:19:40\tSPEAKER_03\n For example, if you want the minimal use buttons such as channel and volume, it just displays four buttons on the screen.\n\n0:19:49\tSPEAKER_03\n And it's possible to press them down just like a touchscreen.\n\n0:19:53\tSPEAKER_01\n So you can adjust which buttons you want on the screen?\n\n0:19:56\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, it will make a possible like that.\n\n0:19:58\tSPEAKER_04\n I'll just add your settings, press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings.\n\n0:20:03\tSPEAKER_04\n So the other buttons are gone.\n\n0:20:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:06\tSPEAKER_00\n So we're going for an LCD screen.\n\n0:20:08\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:09\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's the most interesting thing here.\n\n0:20:11\tSPEAKER_00\n And hoping that when we produce a lot, it won't be too expensive.\n\n0:20:14\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:20:15\tSPEAKER_01\n But we had 1250, I guess, for a rev limiter?\n\n0:20:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:18\tSPEAKER_01\n How expensive is that?\n\n0:20:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Any guesses?\n\n0:20:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, I suppose with...\n\n0:20:27\tSPEAKER_03\n If the young people are interested in LCD screens, we shall make them.\n\n0:20:35\tSPEAKER_03\n And if that is our market share to our goal to deliver those remotely.\n\n0:20:41\tSPEAKER_01\n And we also said that we should not only focus on the younger people also on the older people.\n\n0:20:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but will they use it if it only has an LCD screen?\n\n0:20:48\tSPEAKER_04\n 46 to 45, 33% and 56 to 65 to 12%.\n\n0:20:54\tSPEAKER_04\n But our project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets with customers that are younger than 40.\n\n0:21:02\tSPEAKER_01\n But you don't want to alienate the other?\n\n0:21:05\tSPEAKER_04\n No, they're not now.\n\n0:21:07\tSPEAKER_01\n So if they also buy them, that's all right.\n\n0:21:10\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, but market share for 40 years in younger is higher than that of 60%.\n\n0:21:14\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, I think that of 65 in younger.\n\n0:21:17\tSPEAKER_00\n All right.\n\n0:21:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so LCD it is?\n\n0:21:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:21:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:21:22\tSPEAKER_03\n It's true.\n\n0:21:23\tSPEAKER_02\n How do we...\n\n0:21:24\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, if it gets too much to expensive, then we should be sticking to rubber buttons.\n\n0:21:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, can you...\n\n0:21:34\tSPEAKER_03\n I think that the day we'll send you some information about the cost of LCD screen.\n\n0:21:39\tSPEAKER_04\n We're not seeing no costs at all.\n\n0:21:41\tSPEAKER_03\n So if you receive an email about that, can you post it in the...\n\n0:21:47\tSPEAKER_03\n I should be post that in our project map, I think.\n\n0:21:50\tSPEAKER_04\n I think we all get the costs of everything.\n\n0:21:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Because you are the marketing...\n\n0:21:58\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:21:59\tSPEAKER_04\n I'll post it.\n\n0:22:00\tSPEAKER_01\n We should have a backup plan that we would use, but...\n\n0:22:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Sure, sure.\n\n0:22:04\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, but for now, LCD, yeah.\n\n0:22:07\tSPEAKER_04\n Then you have 75% of use finally to ugly.\n\n0:22:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, LCD.\n\n0:22:12\tSPEAKER_04\n And 80% of the users would spend more money with the random remote who would look fancy.\n\n0:22:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, this is...\n\n0:22:18\tSPEAKER_01\n No problem.\n\n0:22:19\tSPEAKER_04\n No, it'll look fancy with the LCD screen.\n\n0:22:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but they don't like it.\n\n0:22:24\tSPEAKER_01\n They think it's ugly.\n\n0:22:25\tSPEAKER_01\n When it has an LCD.\n\n0:22:26\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, they just play your remote.\n\n0:22:28\tSPEAKER_04\n Not specific LCD remote.\n\n0:22:29\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:22:30\tSPEAKER_01\n I told them you said that.\n\n0:22:32\tSPEAKER_00\n So maybe you can make something fancy out of an LCD remote because it's new, as far as I know.\n\n0:22:37\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, of course.\n\n0:22:39\tSPEAKER_04\n And then you have another thing that's 75% separate, but that's not a question with the LCD screen.\n\n0:22:46\tSPEAKER_04\n The only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off one is in the time to get all the fingerprints off it.\n\n0:22:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:54\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:22:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:22:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, what else does our remote need?\n\n0:22:58\tSPEAKER_00\n The remote button.\n\n0:23:00\tSPEAKER_04\n The remote button.\n\n0:23:03\tSPEAKER_04\n The most important things on a remote control are channel selection, volume selection, and power usage, and the tailed text, but that is not of the question.\n\n0:23:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Other things are...\n\n0:23:18\tSPEAKER_01\n You can put a button of the tailed text on the...\n\n0:23:21\tSPEAKER_01\n For people who want to use it.\n\n0:23:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it could be.\n\n0:23:24\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, I've got a big remote.\n\n0:23:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Which means you have to fill.\n\n0:23:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, and we could make a separate menu on the LCD.\n\n0:23:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, the tailed text.\n\n0:23:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, thanks.\n\n0:23:33\tSPEAKER_04\n And also less important things are screen settings, audio settings, and channel settings.\n\n0:23:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, less important, because I think they should be there.\n\n0:23:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, it should be there, but not in a separate menu.\n\n0:23:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I think it's also important to make it possible to...\n\n0:23:48\tSPEAKER_03\n How do you call it in English?\n\n0:23:52\tSPEAKER_03\n To not use batteries, and use batteries to...\n\n0:23:57\tSPEAKER_03\n I have a little help.\n\n0:23:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, so you can mount the...\n\n0:24:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, the brackets.\n\n0:24:04\tSPEAKER_03\n And remote control to...\n\n0:24:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Charge it.\n\n0:24:07\tSPEAKER_01\n I think of it to...\n\n0:24:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but we don't...\n\n0:24:10\tSPEAKER_04\n I don't know why it's so easy to add.\n\n0:24:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, because when you get an LCD screen, you run it on batteries.\n\n0:24:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Batteries will be...\n\n0:24:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:18\tSPEAKER_01\n...for each one of the most important things.\n\n0:24:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Perhaps you should be able to switch the control off.\n\n0:24:22\tSPEAKER_01\n If you have an LCD screen that burns all the time, you know.\n\n0:24:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:24:26\tSPEAKER_01\n You shouldn't...\n\n0:24:29\tSPEAKER_01\n That's where extra that you have first to turn the remote on, and then you can...\n\n0:24:33\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, I think it's not that easy, because I don't think people like it...\n\n0:24:39\tSPEAKER_04\n That you have to turn it on first, and then use it.\n\n0:24:43\tSPEAKER_04\n I think it's better when the D-fish shuts down or remote shuts down.\n\n0:24:46\tSPEAKER_03\n And it goes turn by mile when you don't use it.\n\n0:24:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, automatically.\n\n0:24:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, automatically.\n\n0:24:53\tSPEAKER_00\n And maybe a low battery indicator?\n\n0:24:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, on the screen.\n\n0:25:00\tSPEAKER_04\n Sure.\n\n0:25:01\tSPEAKER_04\n Before an hour when it gets empty, they have plenty of time to recharge it.\n\n0:25:09\tSPEAKER_04\n Of the pudding in rechargeer.\n\n0:25:11\tSPEAKER_04\n Charger.\n\n0:25:12\tSPEAKER_00\n So we are going for a rechargeer.\n\n0:25:15\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, it's slim.\n\n0:25:17\tSPEAKER_04\n It's slim.\n\n0:25:19\tSPEAKER_04\n It's sensible.\n\n0:25:23\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, because when you're watching TV, you're stepping, you have to put it in rechargeer.\n\n0:25:28\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, that's what you're doing.\n\n0:25:30\tSPEAKER_03\n When you're done with...\n\n0:25:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, okay, but don't be...\n\n0:25:33\tSPEAKER_04\n Watch me show that you have to put batteries go six hours five, six hours.\n\n0:25:37\tSPEAKER_01\n But you also forget to put it in.\n\n0:25:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that's probably...\n\n0:25:40\tSPEAKER_01\n You start on a couch and you don't...\n\n0:25:41\tSPEAKER_03\n But you also forget to buy batteries.\n\n0:25:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:44\tSPEAKER_03\n And then you can use it.\n\n0:25:46\tSPEAKER_04\n You have to be sure that the battery is lost a couple of days with the torch.\n\n0:25:50\tSPEAKER_01\n So I think the battery should work a lot longer than a couple of days?\n\n0:25:55\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, because you have a LCD screen.\n\n0:25:57\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, that's...\n\n0:25:58\tSPEAKER_04\n Hi-Power usage.\n\n0:25:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Hi-Power usage.\n\n0:26:00\tSPEAKER_03\n So it should be a standard move to put your remote control in the charger when you're done with watching television.\n\n0:26:08\tSPEAKER_03\n That's also a great advantage because you can't lose it anymore.\n\n0:26:13\tSPEAKER_03\n You are obliged to put in the charger and not to leave any a couch between some cushions.\n\n0:26:20\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:23\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, we're at a point there.\n\n0:26:25\tSPEAKER_01\n But then you also have to have somewhere where you can put your charger near your couch because otherwise you have to...\n\n0:26:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, otherwise.\n\n0:26:33\tSPEAKER_01\n We're going to turn on the TV.\n\n0:26:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Just a small device.\n\n0:26:37\tSPEAKER_04\n I think everything has to be like a telephone charger or something.\n\n0:26:40\tSPEAKER_03\n And just the cable or even the charger when you can mount it on.\n\n0:26:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, something like that.\n\n0:26:47\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:26:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:26:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, well.\n\n0:26:50\tSPEAKER_04\n It's easy to use also.\n\n0:26:52\tSPEAKER_04\n Or things.\n\n0:26:53\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:26:55\tSPEAKER_04\n Marked share speaker speech recognition.\n\n0:26:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Partial designs for the elderly.\n\n0:27:01\tSPEAKER_03\n You could make it possible to enlarge the screen.\n\n0:27:05\tSPEAKER_03\n To make it possible to not display a button at 10 points.\n\n0:27:12\tSPEAKER_04\n I think this will be standard.\n\n0:27:15\tSPEAKER_04\n But I just want to know functions you have to specify.\n\n0:27:18\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:19\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:27:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Because we can look at perhaps 40 buttons at the screen but in the elderly only look at two buttons.\n\n0:27:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:27:30\tSPEAKER_03\n And you say something about speech recognition?\n\n0:27:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, it's all working.\n\n0:27:35\tSPEAKER_03\n 12.\n\n0:27:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, 12.\n\n0:27:37\tSPEAKER_04\n 12.\n\n0:27:38\tSPEAKER_04\n Also, 91% 16 to 25, 26 to 35 years, 76% and 36 to 45 to 35%.\n\n0:27:45\tSPEAKER_04\n That's wonderful.\n\n0:27:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Then I...\n\n0:27:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Even bigger than for LCD.\n\n0:27:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Let's do speech.\n\n0:27:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, let's leave out all the remote controls and just put a microphone on top of the telephone.\n\n0:27:59\tSPEAKER_03\n 19.\n\n0:28:00\tSPEAKER_03\n 25.\n\n0:28:01\tSPEAKER_01\n You can slap or something.\n\n0:28:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Turn volume up.\n\n0:28:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Hey, that's not it.\n\n0:28:07\tSPEAKER_03\n It's all you look.\n\n0:28:08\tSPEAKER_01\n You say the wrong thing.\n\n0:28:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:28:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, that should...\n\n0:28:12\tSPEAKER_03\n It has to be remote control now.\n\n0:28:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, remote control.\n\n0:28:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Well.\n\n0:28:16\tSPEAKER_01\n But they want to talk into the remote control or something.\n\n0:28:19\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, why not?\n\n0:28:20\tSPEAKER_04\n It's probably much better for speech recognition in remote control.\n\n0:28:23\tSPEAKER_01\n So, the thing it says.\n\n0:28:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Do we want to implement that?\n\n0:28:28\tSPEAKER_04\n I think good LCD screen should be sufficient.\n\n0:28:30\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:31\tSPEAKER_00\n But when you look at percentages.\n\n0:28:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it says a lot.\n\n0:28:34\tSPEAKER_04\n But...\n\n0:28:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Perhaps the option should be...\n\n0:28:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Of course, even higher.\n\n0:28:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Why not?\n\n0:28:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Why not?\n\n0:28:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe because of the cost.\n\n0:28:40\tSPEAKER_03\n But nobody knows how much.\n\n0:28:41\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's better to have LCD screen because in the area of 36 to 45, we have about 30%\n\n0:28:52\tSPEAKER_04\n of the market share in our hands. And 55 of those people want LCD screen and 35% speak resolution.\n\n0:29:02\tSPEAKER_04\n So I think it's better to keep it with LCD screen.\n\n0:29:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Would it be useful to implement both?\n\n0:29:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, with the cost.\n\n0:29:11\tSPEAKER_01\n So allow it.\n\n0:29:12\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know that it can be done with the cost of 1250.\n\n0:29:16\tSPEAKER_01\n If it should be done.\n\n0:29:18\tSPEAKER_04\n If it could be done.\n\n0:29:19\tSPEAKER_04\n I would do it better.\n\n0:29:21\tSPEAKER_01\n But now would you like to implement that?\n\n0:29:23\tSPEAKER_01\n I would like to say volume up and then...\n\n0:29:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Certain systems already exist, I think.\n\n0:29:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Then you also have to have different languages.\n\n0:29:32\tSPEAKER_01\n If we go international.\n\n0:29:34\tSPEAKER_01\n It's true.\n\n0:29:35\tSPEAKER_01\n It's used to do a French and Dutch and English.\n\n0:29:38\tSPEAKER_04\n But that should be also common with some software.\n\n0:29:41\tSPEAKER_04\n It should be also with LCD screen.\n\n0:29:42\tSPEAKER_04\n Because I think it's Chinese.\n\n0:29:43\tSPEAKER_04\n It's different written volume.\n\n0:29:44\tSPEAKER_04\n It's different written than in...\n\n0:29:46\tSPEAKER_04\n So I hear you something.\n\n0:29:48\tSPEAKER_01\n You can use icons for the speaker.\n\n0:29:52\tSPEAKER_01\n And...\n\n0:29:53\tSPEAKER_01\n You have to have better than language.\n\n0:29:56\tSPEAKER_01\n For the...\n\n0:29:58\tSPEAKER_03\n So you want to...\n\n0:30:00\tSPEAKER_03\n It's international.\n\n0:30:02\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:30:03\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:30:04\tSPEAKER_04\n What else?\n\n0:30:05\tSPEAKER_00\n So no speech organization?\n\n0:30:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, if it could be done with...\n\n0:30:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:10\tSPEAKER_03\n It should be done.\n\n0:30:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:12\tSPEAKER_00\n And then with different languages.\n\n0:30:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:15\tSPEAKER_01\n That should be...\n\n0:30:16\tSPEAKER_00\n That's not so difficult.\n\n0:30:17\tSPEAKER_03\n I already used several...\n\n0:30:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Several voice-operated systems.\n\n0:30:22\tSPEAKER_03\n And they are all possible to...\n\n0:30:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Now all that.\n\n0:30:25\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it's difficult.\n\n0:30:26\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's difficult to adjust the thing.\n\n0:30:28\tSPEAKER_04\n Every language of dialects.\n\n0:30:30\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:31\tSPEAKER_04\n I think it's very different.\n\n0:30:32\tSPEAKER_01\n I have to speak so that you can understand.\n\n0:30:35\tSPEAKER_04\n I think it can be implemented.\n\n0:30:39\tSPEAKER_04\n But maybe...\n\n0:30:40\tSPEAKER_01\n You could use that as an option.\n\n0:30:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, an option.\n\n0:30:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:30:44\tSPEAKER_04\n Money left for some.\n\n0:30:45\tSPEAKER_04\n 50 euros.\n\n0:30:46\tSPEAKER_01\n That's the speed.\n\n0:30:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Speed recognition.\n\n0:30:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:30:50\tSPEAKER_00\n So we only do that when we have enough money left.\n\n0:30:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:30:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, I've written down an honor off button.\n\n0:30:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Volume selection, channel selection.\n\n0:31:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Digits from 1 to 0.\n\n0:31:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Or from 0 to 9.\n\n0:31:07\tSPEAKER_00\n A digit button to switch between 1 and 2 digits.\n\n0:31:12\tSPEAKER_00\n A mute button.\n\n0:31:14\tSPEAKER_00\n A separate menu for a TED-Tex.\n\n0:31:16\tSPEAKER_00\n A battery indicator.\n\n0:31:18\tSPEAKER_00\n We're going to use a docking station.\n\n0:31:20\tSPEAKER_00\n And probably LCD.\n\n0:31:23\tSPEAKER_00\n And if there's enough money, speed recognition.\n\n0:31:26\tSPEAKER_00\n And the possibility to enlarge buttons or to have large buttons.\n\n0:31:31\tSPEAKER_01\n With the TED-Tex, it wasn't very important.\n\n0:31:35\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:31:36\tSPEAKER_01\n But...\n\n0:31:37\tSPEAKER_01\n You also know of colors.\n\n0:31:38\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know if we should implement that.\n\n0:31:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Coach?\n\n0:31:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:42\tSPEAKER_01\n When you press the red button, you go to page 1 on the 2.\n\n0:31:45\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know if we should implement that.\n\n0:31:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Because it says that TED-Tex not really important.\n\n0:31:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Short cuts.\n\n0:31:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:53\tSPEAKER_04\n Short cuts.\n\n0:31:54\tSPEAKER_04\n I think we could also implement audio settings, screen settings.\n\n0:31:58\tSPEAKER_04\n And channel settings, but at sub menus.\n\n0:32:01\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:02\tSPEAKER_04\n Mainly if you turn the remote control on, you have to see 1 to 0 channel a volume.\n\n0:32:08\tSPEAKER_04\n And if you want to use TED-Tex screen or audio, then you can press it.\n\n0:32:12\tSPEAKER_03\n It should be available, but not directly available.\n\n0:32:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:32:18\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:32:19\tSPEAKER_00\n So not too much TED-Tex support, but in a separate menu.\n\n0:32:24\tSPEAKER_01\n So actually it is there, but...\n\n0:32:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but it's not really there.\n\n0:32:28\tSPEAKER_03\n So there's a few to use.\n\n0:32:30\tSPEAKER_03\n We have to be easy to use.\n\n0:32:32\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll search.\n\n0:32:33\tSPEAKER_03\n If you want to use TED-Tex, you can press TED-Tex button.\n\n0:32:37\tSPEAKER_03\n And then the options become available.\n\n0:32:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that's it.\n\n0:32:41\tSPEAKER_04\n The design of it.\n\n0:32:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, but no more buttons or functions are...\n\n0:32:47\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:32:48\tSPEAKER_00\n What else can you do with TED-Tex?\n\n0:32:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Are we forgetting something?\n\n0:32:52\tSPEAKER_01\n I have to cut real examples here, but I don't think there's anything really wrong with it.\n\n0:32:56\tSPEAKER_04\n Play POS doesn't need to be...\n\n0:32:59\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, we don't have a video on this.\n\n0:33:01\tSPEAKER_04\n The worst is your presentation.\n\n0:33:04\tSPEAKER_04\n You could check the other remote controls.\n\n0:33:07\tSPEAKER_01\n You could get the POS features.\n\n0:33:09\tSPEAKER_04\n Which was...\n\n0:33:11\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:33:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Technical functions.\n\n0:33:15\tSPEAKER_01\n They're a bit small, you should stretch them.\n\n0:33:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Because...\n\n0:33:19\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n0:33:21\tSPEAKER_04\n Technical focus.\n\n0:33:23\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:33:24\tSPEAKER_01\n I guess we've got a little...\n\n0:33:26\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, I got you have for even mute play.\n\n0:33:30\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, this is actually pretty good.\n\n0:33:33\tSPEAKER_04\n For slow...\n\n0:33:35\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, the zoom buttons.\n\n0:33:37\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, white screen, high screen, different things.\n\n0:33:41\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, that's even put them on now.\n\n0:33:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, different.\n\n0:33:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:33:47\tSPEAKER_01\n But that should also be a sub menu.\n\n0:33:49\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, it should be available then in sub screen settings or something.\n\n0:33:52\tSPEAKER_01\n So we should also implement sub screen settings.\n\n0:33:54\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, screen settings, audio settings, analytics settings you have, general settings.\n\n0:34:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, so you can probably...\n\n0:34:02\tSPEAKER_01\n So those four end, of course, the main.\n\n0:34:04\tSPEAKER_01\n So the first you see the main and the other ones you can go to...\n\n0:34:07\tSPEAKER_04\n Like depth screens or something, or...\n\n0:34:10\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:34:12\tSPEAKER_01\n I hope we can do this.\n\n0:34:14\tSPEAKER_03\n So it's depending on what kind of television you got.\n\n0:34:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Because if you don't have a white screen television,\n\n0:34:20\tSPEAKER_04\n you don't need to be a screen-saving thing for... You don't use it.\n\n0:34:24\tSPEAKER_03\n And if the television does not support such operations...\n\n0:34:28\tSPEAKER_01\n You don't have to use that tab.\n\n0:34:30\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:34:31\tSPEAKER_04\n So you leave it.\n\n0:34:32\tSPEAKER_04\n Hello.\n\n0:34:34\tSPEAKER_04\n Or it could be possible to have a standard version of the remote.\n\n0:34:38\tSPEAKER_04\n Expand its version.\n\n0:34:40\tSPEAKER_01\n And do we want them in different colors?\n\n0:34:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Or...\n\n0:34:44\tSPEAKER_01\n And the buttons to change colors?\n\n0:34:46\tSPEAKER_03\n The colors, I think, the main color of the remote control is the color of the LCD screen.\n\n0:34:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:52\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, you can use the device itself.\n\n0:34:54\tSPEAKER_04\n How many percent?\n\n0:34:56\tSPEAKER_04\n 80 percent.\n\n0:34:57\tSPEAKER_04\n I think it's up here.\n\n0:34:58\tSPEAKER_03\n We'll spend more money if it looks fancy.\n\n0:35:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Very... a lot of people...\n\n0:35:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Perhaps you can make adjustable front.\n\n0:35:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Like with it.\n\n0:35:05\tSPEAKER_01\n I just want to farm this.\n\n0:35:06\tSPEAKER_01\n You can...\n\n0:35:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:35:10\tSPEAKER_01\n But I think that...\n\n0:35:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, make it a bit of a different color.\n\n0:35:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Red, white, blue, black.\n\n0:35:20\tSPEAKER_03\n A rustical...\n\n0:35:22\tSPEAKER_03\n She's blue.\n\n0:35:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Same-sensversion.\n\n0:35:26\tSPEAKER_04\n She pressed a button.\n\n0:35:28\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, leave.\n\n0:35:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Well.\n\n0:35:32\tSPEAKER_00\n 5 minutes.\n\n0:35:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Single for our final 5 minutes.\n\n0:35:36\tSPEAKER_00\n So I have the things I just read.\n\n0:35:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Then we have separate menus for data text, screen settings, audio settings, and what else?\n\n0:35:44\tSPEAKER_04\n Channel settings?\n\n0:35:46\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:35:48\tSPEAKER_00\n You can program this to here.\n\n0:35:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:35:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Perhaps you should...\n\n0:35:54\tSPEAKER_01\n You throw them in one pile.\n\n0:35:56\tSPEAKER_01\n And then you set them.\n\n0:35:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Otherwise you have all those text, perhaps, still text.\n\n0:36:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Not...\n\n0:36:02\tSPEAKER_04\n Or like...\n\n0:36:04\tSPEAKER_04\n Or like a menu button.\n\n0:36:06\tSPEAKER_04\n Or a separate menu.\n\n0:36:08\tSPEAKER_04\n Or a menu button.\n\n0:36:10\tSPEAKER_04\n Or a menu button.\n\n0:36:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Or a menu button.\n\n0:36:14\tSPEAKER_00\n They have main usage audio settings.\n\n0:36:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay. But we can work it out later.\n\n0:36:18\tSPEAKER_00\n So we're having a general menu with the most used functions.\n\n0:36:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Data text, screen settings, audio settings, channel settings.\n\n0:36:22\tSPEAKER_00\n And maybe there are options for the remote itself.\n\n0:36:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Like large icons or small icons.\n\n0:36:28\tSPEAKER_04\n I think...\n\n0:36:30\tSPEAKER_04\n Because we don't have a lot of buttons on one screen.\n\n0:36:32\tSPEAKER_04\n We don't have any buttons.\n\n0:36:34\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, but...\n\n0:36:36\tSPEAKER_04\n We have our left channel button, the volume button, those buttons.\n\n0:36:40\tSPEAKER_04\n And we have all the else in here.\n\n0:36:42\tSPEAKER_02\n It's also the ELCD, right?\n\n0:36:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:46\tSPEAKER_04\n So we don't have any normal buttons.\n\n0:36:48\tSPEAKER_04\n No, normal buttons.\n\n0:36:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe only the...\n\n0:36:52\tSPEAKER_00\n That remote itself.\n\n0:36:54\tSPEAKER_00\n No. No.\n\n0:36:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:36:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Or well, you should be able to set which TV you have.\n\n0:37:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, sure. Of course you need the settings button.\n\n0:37:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Or settings option for the remote control.\n\n0:37:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:08\tSPEAKER_01\n But there's an idea to use what you said.\n\n0:37:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Normal on and off button for the TV.\n\n0:37:14\tSPEAKER_04\n No, no, no.\n\n0:37:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Because we discussed that you could charge it.\n\n0:37:18\tSPEAKER_04\n Otherwise it...\n\n0:37:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but not for the remote, but for the TV.\n\n0:37:24\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, the TV of course.\n\n0:37:26\tSPEAKER_04\n I think that's the best thing is that we implement that one in the menu with the volume.\n\n0:37:32\tSPEAKER_00\n But not as normal button in here.\n\n0:37:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, maybe there should be a separate button apart from the LC.\n\n0:37:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Because you can't turn it on when the LCV is off.\n\n0:37:40\tSPEAKER_00\n So how do you turn the thing on?\n\n0:37:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, you just tap remote.\n\n0:37:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, just tap it.\n\n0:37:46\tSPEAKER_00\n That's the screen thing.\n\n0:37:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes, remote.\n\n0:37:50\tSPEAKER_04\n No, just remote.\n\n0:37:52\tSPEAKER_04\n Tell if you don't have to be on.\n\n0:37:54\tSPEAKER_04\n That's why you can press on.\n\n0:37:56\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, it should be in standby mode.\n\n0:37:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, then by the press and remote press on and then TV should be.\n\n0:38:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Affailable.\n\n0:38:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:04\tNone\n Or not.\n\n0:38:04\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know whether it's handy to have a normal on button.\n\n0:38:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Just remember for TV so you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel.\n\n0:38:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Otherwise you...\n\n0:38:10\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know whether or not it's...\n\n0:38:12\tSPEAKER_03\n A normal button on the remote control.\n\n0:38:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, or normal.\n\n0:38:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Or you should put it in the SD screen.\n\n0:38:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, because when you touch the SD screen when it is in standby mode, it should pop on.\n\n0:38:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n0:38:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Why would it be handy to have an on button?\n\n0:38:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I guess if you use the SD screen, you first have to search where the on button and then you then turn it and then the TV goes on.\n\n0:38:40\tSPEAKER_01\n But if you have a normal on button on the remote, then you do it on and then you search the channel that you want.\n\n0:38:48\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, but I think the remote control if you press step the screen, it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button, channel button and of course also the other off button.\n\n0:39:00\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it looks a lot more fancy.\n\n0:39:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I think so too.\n\n0:39:04\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't have any buttons on.\n\n0:39:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, no buttons.\n\n0:39:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, well that might be a unique setting point.\n\n0:39:12\tSPEAKER_00\n If we can afford it, I guess.\n\n0:39:16\tSPEAKER_00\n I was born for the discussion to our next meeting because we're running out of time.\n\n0:39:22\tSPEAKER_00\n For now, we're having a lunch break.\n\n0:39:24\tSPEAKER_00\n And then there will be half an hour for the next share of individual work.\n\n0:39:30\tSPEAKER_00\n I will write minutes if I can create them out of this.\n\n0:39:35\tSPEAKER_00\n And put them in the project documents folder and here are the individual actions for the other roles.\n\n0:39:43\tSPEAKER_00\n And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your personal coach.\n\n0:39:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Luckily, as we are.\n\n0:39:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, well, thank you very much.\n\n0:39:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Lunch.\n\n0:39:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Have a nice lunch.\n\n0:39:55\tSPEAKER_04\n Food.\n\n0:39:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Should we put this back in our room?\n\n0:40:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n0:40:05\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:40:07\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:40:09\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:40:11\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:40:13\tNone\n Oh yeah.\n\n0:40:15\tNone\n Thanks.\n\n0:40:17\tNone\n Oh, sorry.\n\n0:40:21\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:40:25\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:40:35\tSPEAKER_04\n Zoom.\n\n0:40:39\tNone\n Zoom.\n\n0:40:49\tNone\n Zoom.\n\n0:40:53\tNone\n Zoom.\n\n0:40:57\tNone\n Zoom.\n\n0:41:01\tNone\n Zoom.\n\n0:41:03\tNone\n Zoom.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "The functional design meeting is taking place.
