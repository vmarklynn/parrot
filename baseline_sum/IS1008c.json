I think they could use.\n\n0:10:10\tSPEAKER_03\n I would have done that anyway forola pepper and plastic.\n\n0:10:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:14\tSPEAKER_02\n I would do that.\n\n0:10:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Could you give me additional materials as well?\n\n0:10:18\tSPEAKER_00\n We vont het ag Wirk\u00c3\u00a9tique, ja weet ik\n\n0:10:39\tSPEAKER_01\n we zijn draandje ja Ja?\n\n0:10:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Dus het is een heel sch clip op van truth, omdat ik naar het o twitch aan het gevoel heb.\n\n0:10:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Dushole.\n\n0:10:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Dus if je kijkt net naar de lecture en op de seconde understeel, Which basically shows, ik ben aan voor Durantweer en liepen datummy.\n\n0:11:01\tSPEAKER_01\n En dames en Stock, aan het vertellen.\n\n0:11:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Land of \u00d0\u00bf\u00d1\u0080\u00d0\u00be\u00d1\u0086iek?\n\n0:11:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Maar dit kun je wel leader schermt, vogel en vallahi.\n\n0:11:09\tNone\n De manieraxis we kunnen\u00e5\u00a5\u00b9ende bedankwouderen\u00e4\u00b8\u00ba\u00e4\u00bb\u0080\u00e4\u00b9\u0088 we controken ainkaillingen en kunstro \u00d0\u00bc\u00d0\u00bd\u00d0\u00b5uwen voor eten\u00d0\u00a0\u00d8\u00ad funderen File A anti inevitably\n\n0:11:29\tSPEAKER_02\n En ook of regel bubbles\n\n0:11:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Dat is echt een goed idea voor de customisability. One thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it, just like you have on flip phones, so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it, especially if you have little kids around.\n\n0:11:51\tSPEAKER_01\n They're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a TV show and accidentally change a channel or turn it off.\n\n0:11:55\tSPEAKER_01\n And also you had issues with batteries running at.\n\n0:12:00\tSPEAKER_01\n I thought maybe we could put a little battery life light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery starts to die.\n\n0:12:07\tSPEAKER_01\n And in terms of invisible features, audio and tactile feedback on button presses.\n\n0:12:13\tSPEAKER_01\n And like you said, speech recognition.\n\n0:12:17\tSPEAKER_01\n So in terms of what this thing would actually look like, despite working an interface design, it's the greatest artist in the world, so you'll have to forgive me.\n\n0:12:30\tSPEAKER_01\n You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big, sort of in the corner and by itself.\n\n0:12:36\tSPEAKER_01\n So you don't accidentally turn your TV off while you're trying to maneuver other buttons.\n\n0:12:40\tSPEAKER_01\n And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for channels and volume, sort of surfing channels and then volume.\n\n0:12:51\tSPEAKER_01\n So the volume would be the up and down, because volume goes up and down.\n\n0:12:55\tSPEAKER_01\n And then channels left to right.\n\n0:12:57\tSPEAKER_01\n And then here you'd have your sort of standard telephone-ish number pad.\n\n0:13:06\tSPEAKER_01\n And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your TV and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control.\n\n0:13:16\tSPEAKER_01\n So that if the user doesn't want to use their voice, they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you.\n\n0:13:25\tSPEAKER_01\n So again you can have a little LCD light somewhere, the flip thing.\n\n0:13:31\tSPEAKER_01\n And have I forgotten anything?\n\n0:13:35\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't think so.\n\n0:13:36\tSPEAKER_01\n So as you can see, it's a very, very simple design, which is one of the things I really wanted to keep.\n\n0:13:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Just keep it simple, not have too many buttons, not have too many functionalities thrown into it.\n\n0:13:46\tSPEAKER_01\n I think the design can pretty much carry over to everything, although with the wood, the flip screen might have to do something slightly different.\n\n0:13:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe like a copper hinge.\n\n0:13:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:00\tSPEAKER_01\n But you also have to start watching after the wait, because depending on how much the flip screen will add to the wait, of the remote control you don't want it to start getting too heavy.\n\n0:14:08\tSPEAKER_01\n But that's the general layout with the general functionalities.\n\n0:14:11\tSPEAKER_01\n If we come up with something else, as you can see, there's still lots of space on the actual remote control.\n\n0:14:17\tSPEAKER_01\n And if you do it customizably, you could make this thing fairly small or fairly large, depending on personal preferences.\n\n0:14:26\tSPEAKER_01\n So that's pretty much all I had to say.\n\n0:14:30\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, everything else in terms of design issues.\n\n0:14:33\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, the centering of the keypad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is.\n\n0:14:40\tSPEAKER_01\n And you tend to use the volume control and the browsing more than the actual number pad.\n\n0:14:46\tSPEAKER_01\n So that would be sort of a direct line of where your thumb goes when you're holding the remote control.\n\n0:14:50\tSPEAKER_01\n The number pad a little bit lower, because it's used less frequently.\n\n0:14:54\tSPEAKER_01\n So once we decide exactly what we want, then we can figure out the exact positioning.\n\n0:14:58\tSPEAKER_01\n But more or less, I think it should go along those lines.\n\n0:15:04\tSPEAKER_00\n So what's your comment or...\n\n0:15:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Simple design.\n\n0:15:11\tSPEAKER_03\n So what consumers want.\n\n0:15:13\tSPEAKER_03\n It's almost like Houston, we have a product here.\n\n0:15:18\tSPEAKER_03\n The problem is obviously going to be cost.\n\n0:15:22\tSPEAKER_03\n I also have a very simple presentation.\n\n0:15:28\tSPEAKER_03\n From the marketing point, you have to see what the consumers want.\n\n0:15:32\tSPEAKER_03\n I also have a copy to a different type of remote.\n\n0:15:40\tSPEAKER_03\n If you can find me, wherever I'm at.\n\n0:15:43\tSPEAKER_03\n This should only be one in here.\n\n0:15:46\tSPEAKER_03\n But try and watch.\n\n0:15:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Sure.\n\n0:15:54\tSPEAKER_03\n This would be a modified.\n\n0:15:56\tSPEAKER_03\n They're stealing our product.\n\n0:16:00\tSPEAKER_03\n We've been giving simple questionnaires in different ergens.\n\n0:16:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Obviously we have to see what the consumers are looking for today.\n\n0:16:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Because the trends change very, very quickly.\n\n0:16:10\tSPEAKER_03\n In six months, maybe this idea has already gone out the window.\n\n0:16:14\tSPEAKER_03\n So it's going to be a question of how fast we can act.\n\n0:16:17\tSPEAKER_03\n They already erased the rest of mine.\n\n0:16:20\tSPEAKER_02\n No, go to find this.\n\n0:16:22\tSPEAKER_02\n No, no, no.\n\n0:16:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Because I had another comment there.\n\n0:16:26\tSPEAKER_03\n The market trend.\n\n0:16:30\tSPEAKER_03\n This is what we know from the questionnaires.\n\n0:16:33\tSPEAKER_03\n From all the surveys we've done.\n\n0:16:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Fancy and feel good.\n\n0:16:37\tSPEAKER_03\n That's what we've been looking for.\n\n0:16:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Something that feels good in the hand.\n\n0:16:40\tSPEAKER_03\n That's easy to use.\n\n0:16:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Looking for a next generation of innovation.\n\n0:16:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Because all the remotes out there now.\n\n0:16:45\tSPEAKER_03\n They're all very similar.\n\n0:16:46\tSPEAKER_03\n They all do the same thing.\n\n0:16:48\tSPEAKER_03\n We have to have something completely different.\n\n0:16:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Easy to use, as always, become another major interest.\n\n0:16:54\tSPEAKER_03\n With the whiteboard, we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use.\n\n0:16:58\tSPEAKER_03\n And I think this is another thing.\n\n0:17:00\tSPEAKER_03\n It's interesting as the consumers actually will need to pay the price for exciting technology.\n\n0:17:04\tSPEAKER_03\n So even if we have a product that may be more expensive.\n\n0:17:07\tSPEAKER_03\n If it comes out right.\n\n0:17:09\tSPEAKER_03\n If they look and it looks and feels good and has technology.\n\n0:17:14\tSPEAKER_03\n The second two, you can see the last one is a very easy, simple design.\n\n0:17:19\tSPEAKER_03\n The second one, there's about 45,000 different buttons on it.\n\n0:17:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Which makes it fairly hard to read, very hard to use.\n\n0:17:26\tSPEAKER_03\n The first one, I see that they put in a display.\n\n0:17:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Now this is something else with a little flip up.\n\n0:17:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Now we're adding all kinds of things in.\n\n0:17:34\tSPEAKER_03\n But with a little flip up, if you have a little display on the flip up.\n\n0:17:36\tSPEAKER_03\n And when you close it, everything is locked.\n\n0:17:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe the display also makes it easier to use.\n\n0:17:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Because sometimes when you're looking for buttons, maybe if you see a display.\n\n0:17:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Context, sensitive instructions.\n\n0:17:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:17:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Depending on what the TV or the DVD or something else.\n\n0:17:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Especially the standard one.\n\n0:17:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Now you have one with a very simple also.\n\n0:17:59\tSPEAKER_03\n The idea is simple, but with a display.\n\n0:18:01\tSPEAKER_03\n So you can see what you're doing.\n\n0:18:03\tSPEAKER_03\n So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use.\n\n0:18:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Trendy, fancy.\n\n0:18:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Feels good.\n\n0:18:14\tSPEAKER_03\n With a display.\n\n0:18:16\tSPEAKER_03\n wood, designer wood, designer colors.\n\n0:18:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe what you could do is somebody orders the device.\n\n0:18:23\tSPEAKER_02\n You could send them like a, some sort of a foam rubber ball.\n\n0:18:35\tSPEAKER_02\n And then they would squeeze it and it would take the shape of their hands.\n\n0:18:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:40\tSPEAKER_02\n So it's really molded to tears.\n\n0:18:42\tSPEAKER_02\n And then you would know what the geometry of their hands would be.\n\n0:18:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Hardly squeezed.\n\n0:18:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Resistance.\n\n0:18:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Resistance, right.\n\n0:18:54\tSPEAKER_01\n But for that, you'd also have to do an average across families.\n\n0:18:59\tSPEAKER_01\n That's right.\n\n0:19:00\tSPEAKER_01\n That's right.\n\n0:19:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Unless everyone has their own personal remote.\n\n0:19:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, that actually would increase the revenue.\n\n0:19:06\tSPEAKER_02\n The sales.\n\n0:19:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:09\tSPEAKER_03\n I hope so.\n\n0:19:12\tSPEAKER_03\n No, but incorporating the three obviously would be something totally new on the market.\n\n0:19:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Totally different.\n\n0:19:17\tSPEAKER_03\n And.\n\n0:19:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Already the customized ability is a really good sort of.\n\n0:19:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, it was a Nokia that came out with the changeable colors.\n\n0:19:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Take apart and put on another face.\n\n0:19:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Take it off and put on another face.\n\n0:19:33\tSPEAKER_01\n And that took off.\n\n0:19:34\tSPEAKER_01\n They sold millions.\n\n0:19:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Millions.\n\n0:19:37\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:19:39\tSPEAKER_03\n So with the findings with the research, easy to use something totally new.\n\n0:19:43\tSPEAKER_03\n We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market.\n\n0:19:46\tSPEAKER_02\n We'd also have to consider that who we were going to get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes to might learn about labor laws.\n\n0:19:59\tSPEAKER_02\n You know, in different countries and stuff.\n\n0:20:10\tSPEAKER_02\n So we can do it cheap, but you don't want to exploit labor in third world countries.\n\n0:20:16\tSPEAKER_02\n So actually you could turn it, you turn it around and say that your part.\n\n0:20:20\tSPEAKER_00\n The reason that cost is high for the device is because you're paying a working wage to the person who made the device.\n\n0:20:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes, yes.\n\n0:20:29\tSPEAKER_00\n I've been just like India or China or Malaysia.\n\n0:20:32\tSPEAKER_00\n So you can go a bit of futures and better price and you can sell more.\n\n0:20:38\tNone\n Good.\n\n0:20:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, that'd be something that manufacturing would have to explore more.\n\n0:20:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Where would you manufacture this?\n\n0:20:49\tSPEAKER_03\n So another step.\n\n0:20:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:20:52\tSPEAKER_00\n We're here to design.\n\n0:20:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:20:54\tSPEAKER_00\n That we can talk about the production later, it depends on the quantity.\n\n0:20:59\tSPEAKER_00\n So we don't need to have our own fabric factory or something.\n\n0:21:03\tSPEAKER_00\n So we can have a tie up with who do the fabric for the different electronic side times.\n\n0:21:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Then we can have a business tie up and to get the cost to sell more.\n\n0:21:16\tSPEAKER_00\n So let's decide first about the components concept and interface concept.\n\n0:21:23\tSPEAKER_00\n If it is acceptable for both of you, what it was talking.\n\n0:21:30\tSPEAKER_00\n And you were designed with the display or with the display or just a simple.\n\n0:21:38\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it depends.\n\n0:21:39\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's a good idea, but we need to really think about how useful it's going to be because theoretically with a TV you already have a big display right in front of you.\n\n0:21:50\tSPEAKER_01\n So if we're trying to keep costs down, then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go.\n\n0:21:59\tSPEAKER_01\n It depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for.\n\n0:22:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Very specifically what it would be used for.\n\n0:22:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Because if it's only used for one little thing, then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever.\n\n0:22:18\tSPEAKER_01\n It may not be the most cost efficient way to go, but that's just sort of speculation.\n\n0:22:24\tSPEAKER_02\n What do you think Ed?\n\n0:22:26\tSPEAKER_02\n You like the display in one of the concepts that you showed.\n\n0:22:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you know how much it costs to add a little display like this?\n\n0:22:37\tSPEAKER_03\n No, no.\n\n0:22:38\tSPEAKER_02\n You want to take an action item and go find out?\n\n0:22:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Because we have to find out a cost on it.\n\n0:22:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:22:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Sorry about that.\n\n0:22:46\tSPEAKER_03\n No, that's no problem.\n\n0:22:48\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm here for the pushing it after it's made.\n\n0:22:51\tSPEAKER_03\n I will market it.\n\n0:22:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Once we get a price on it, then we can market it.\n\n0:22:58\tSPEAKER_02\n So the advanced chip on print is what we've determined and the engineering industrial design is the recommendation.\n\n0:23:11\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we've come to some agreement regarding this concept of a wooden case.\n\n0:23:20\tSPEAKER_02\n A customizable and...\n\n0:23:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Nice, beautiful, mahargan, red wooden case.\n\n0:23:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Where the buttons be, would too.\n\n0:23:29\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think so.\n\n0:23:30\tSPEAKER_02\n No, I think they could be rubber like they are now.\n\n0:23:33\tSPEAKER_02\n So you have that tactile experience.\n\n0:23:37\tSPEAKER_00\n What we'll do is we will stick with the simple design for time being until the add findouts about how much it's cost to the extra in case we go for the display.\n\n0:23:49\tSPEAKER_00\n So maybe what you can do is both of you can come up with the prototype, the model.\n\n0:23:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:23:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Sure.\n\n0:24:10\tSPEAKER_02\n So, are we done with this meeting?\n\n0:24:14\tSPEAKER_00\n I hope, is it okay if they will come up with the prototype design, then they can show you how it looks like and then we can submit to the...\n\n0:24:24\tSPEAKER_00\n I will submit to the management.\n\n0:24:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay. Then, in the meantime, you can come up with the price, how much it's cost is extra for the display?\n\n0:24:33\tSPEAKER_00\n And I'm marketing strategy.\n\n0:24:34\tSPEAKER_00\n And I'm marketing strategy.\n\n0:24:35\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm marketing strategy.\n\n0:24:36\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm marketing strategy.\n\n0:24:39\tSPEAKER_03\n How much you can fire?\n\n0:24:41\tSPEAKER_00\n How much you can select?\n\n0:24:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Of course, you'll make money too.\n\n0:24:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Not only fired, you make money too.\n\n0:24:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Your commission.\n\n0:24:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so any questions?\n\n0:24:55\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:24:56\tSPEAKER_00\n So, by next meeting, please come up with the prototype.\n\n0:25:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, then we can proceed from there.\n\n0:25:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:25:06\tSPEAKER_00\n So, thanks for all your efforts and coming for the meeting again and see you soon there.\n\n0:25:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:25:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Thank you.\n\n0:25:24\tNone\n Thank you.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "SPEAKER is the project manager, project manager and project manager.
