Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.\n\n0:00:26\tSPEAKER_00\n So we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product.\n\n0:00:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, yep.\n\n0:00:34\tSPEAKER_00\n And here's the gender for this meeting.\n\n0:00:37\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm just going to open, say a few boring words to start with again, and start taking minutes afterwards.\n\n0:00:43\tSPEAKER_00\n You guys are going to give us a presentation of our wonder product that I can see some demonstrations all over there.\n\n0:00:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Looks cool.\n\n0:00:51\tSPEAKER_00\n And they're going to value it.\n\n0:00:53\tSPEAKER_00\n And we're going to talk about finance, and we've got a lovely Excel spreadsheet that I knocked up in the last five minutes for this.\n\n0:00:59\tSPEAKER_00\n And we're going to evaluate the product and close.\n\n0:01:05\tSPEAKER_00\n We've got 40 minutes to do this in.\n\n0:01:07\tSPEAKER_00\n We should be fine.\n\n0:01:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's try and keep this one on schedule.\n\n0:01:11\tSPEAKER_00\n All right.\n\n0:01:12\tSPEAKER_00\n So your thing is in...\n\n0:01:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Where is it?\n\n0:01:20\tSPEAKER_02\n It's the end product thingy.\n\n0:01:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:01:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Who wants it?\n\n0:01:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Peter can have it.\n\n0:01:36\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll talk.\n\n0:01:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, so what we ended up with.\n\n0:01:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Production caught us estimated by our manufacturing department and the research department, which is ours, is 15.8 euros.\n\n0:01:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Someone forgot the unit price.\n\n0:01:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Unit price.\n\n0:01:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Unit production price.\n\n0:01:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Cost.\n\n0:01:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Thank you.\n\n0:02:00\tSPEAKER_02\n We implemented the basic functions, which is just TV functions, plus the locator, which was one of the marketing things.\n\n0:02:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Credo, scroll wheel for the channels.\n\n0:02:16\tSPEAKER_02\n And we implemented the way of putting the new, when role-fositionary zapping your favorite channels functionality in the scroll.\n\n0:02:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Zapping your favorite channels, eh?\n\n0:02:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:02:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Scrolling through your favorite list.\n\n0:02:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, okay.\n\n0:02:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Zapping, you know.\n\n0:02:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Zapping.\n\n0:02:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Ah, okay, okay.\n\n0:02:33\tSPEAKER_02\n That's the favorite support you use.\n\n0:02:36\tSPEAKER_02\n And, yeah, that was the result.\n\n0:02:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:02:40\tSPEAKER_00\n I like the logo on there as well.\n\n0:02:43\tSPEAKER_01\n It's very prominent.\n\n0:02:45\tSPEAKER_00\n It's very prominent.\n\n0:02:46\tSPEAKER_00\n So this is the...\n\n0:02:48\tSPEAKER_01\n So, here, give you this.\n\n0:02:51\tSPEAKER_01\n This is the cradle unit, and this is the actual remote itself.\n\n0:02:56\tSPEAKER_01\n So, the scroll bar, or the scroll wheel, is this green little scrolling guy here.\n\n0:03:02\tSPEAKER_01\n And then the volume controls are here and here.\n\n0:03:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:03:06\tSPEAKER_01\n You've got the keypad, which is the numbers from 0 to 9, and then 10.\n\n0:03:11\tSPEAKER_01\n This is the power button.\n\n0:03:12\tSPEAKER_01\n We have our...\n\n0:03:15\tSPEAKER_01\n We have the enter button, and...\n\n0:03:18\tSPEAKER_01\n What is the other button here?\n\n0:03:21\tSPEAKER_01\n This is the teletext.\n\n0:03:22\tSPEAKER_02\n This is the teletext.\n\n0:03:23\tSPEAKER_02\n The start to...\n\n0:03:24\tSPEAKER_02\n The program button.\n\n0:03:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, the program button.\n\n0:03:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, the program button.\n\n0:03:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, KSC.\n\n0:03:28\tSPEAKER_01\n So this button will be used both for the favorites, and for programming your...\n\n0:03:33\tSPEAKER_01\n the type of television you want to use.\n\n0:03:36\tSPEAKER_01\n So, the plastic is the white area of this...\n\n0:03:40\tSPEAKER_01\n of the model here, and the red area is like a rubber covering.\n\n0:03:43\tSPEAKER_01\n So, you can see that when it lays like this, or like this.\n\n0:03:46\tSPEAKER_01\n And the buttons are all going to be rubber.\n\n0:03:48\tSPEAKER_01\n So, it's pretty hard to actually damage it.\n\n0:03:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Is that...\n\n0:03:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Could that be easy for this scroll wheel to be rotated if it...\n\n0:03:55\tSPEAKER_00\n one's on it?\n\n0:03:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that might be a possible...\n\n0:03:59\tSPEAKER_01\n a possible problem, but...\n\n0:04:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Not helping.\n\n0:04:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:04:04\tSPEAKER_00\n No, I guess it depends on the stiffness of the rubber.\n\n0:04:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:04:09\tSPEAKER_01\n And it depends on if it's sliding.\n\n0:04:12\tSPEAKER_01\n But I think it's pretty ergonomic, you can feel it.\n\n0:04:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it's good.\n\n0:04:16\tSPEAKER_00\n I take it that this is going to be slightly lighter in the...\n\n0:04:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, of course.\n\n0:04:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, this is correct.\n\n0:04:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it's going to go...\n\n0:04:24\tSPEAKER_00\n You have to reach it.\n\n0:04:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, the power button is a bit of a reach, but I think we might scale down the final model a bit.\n\n0:04:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, yeah, that would make sense.\n\n0:04:31\tSPEAKER_01\n This is a bit larger than it would be, but...\n\n0:04:33\tSPEAKER_02\n It's cool.\n\n0:04:34\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't have no one on the head.\n\n0:04:36\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm just going to go ahead and hold it.\n\n0:04:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Which was the marketing perspective?\n\n0:04:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, I like it.\n\n0:04:42\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, you guys gave me more than I was asking for, so I'm happy.\n\n0:04:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Because we've got some really marketable features in this.\n\n0:04:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I think it's a good job.\n\n0:04:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Pedro can demonstrate that...\n\n0:04:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, page inability.\n\n0:04:57\tSPEAKER_02\n So, you have the base station with the little button for the...\n\n0:05:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Where's my remote?\n\n0:05:03\tSPEAKER_02\n BEEP BEEP BEEP!\n\n0:05:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, blah.\n\n0:05:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, that function.\n\n0:05:08\tSPEAKER_03\n That's correct.\n\n0:05:10\tSPEAKER_03\n That's correct.\n\n0:05:11\tSPEAKER_03\n BEEP BEEP BEEP!\n\n0:05:13\tSPEAKER_00\n So, let me get it.\n\n0:05:15\tSPEAKER_00\n If I press this button...\n\n0:05:17\tSPEAKER_00\n BEEP BEEP BEEP!\n\n0:05:18\tSPEAKER_00\n That's where it goes.\n\n0:05:21\tSPEAKER_00\n BEEP BEEP BEEP!\n\n0:05:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Shut up!\n\n0:05:24\tSPEAKER_01\n So, you can take this home.\n\n0:05:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Take this home with you tonight, and you can push that, and he'll be across town.\n\n0:05:29\tSPEAKER_00\n BEEP BEEP BEEP!\n\n0:05:31\tSPEAKER_00\n I find that...\n\n0:05:34\tSPEAKER_00\n...to be blue, to charge off of.\n\n0:05:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Exactly, that's exactly what those are for.\n\n0:05:40\tSPEAKER_01\n And there's one other feature that we were debating, but we decided to go against it, is...\n\n0:05:45\tSPEAKER_01\n You could...\n\n0:05:46\tSPEAKER_01\n BEEP BEEP BEEP!\n\n0:05:49\tSPEAKER_01\n We were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here, because you have this trigger.\n\n0:05:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:54\tSPEAKER_01\n It kind of feels like there should be something there, but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there.\n\n0:05:59\tSPEAKER_01\n And we don't want to accidentally be hitting the power button like that.\n\n0:06:02\tSPEAKER_00\n But maybe if you had a trigger, plus the scroll, then that would get past the problem of landing and scrolling, because then it would need to be hit in both sides.\n\n0:06:08\tSPEAKER_01\n So maybe in the final design phase, we might tweak that a little bit.\n\n0:06:11\tSPEAKER_00\n But it's definitely got options for different types of models and things as well, based on that, isn't it?\n\n0:06:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Yep, I like.\n\n0:06:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Good job.\n\n0:06:22\tSPEAKER_00\n So, is that the final color scheme as well?\n\n0:06:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh no!\n\n0:06:25\tSPEAKER_01\n This is just what we had to work with at the time.\n\n0:06:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:06:29\tSPEAKER_01\n So we'll leave the color scheme up to the marketing people.\n\n0:06:31\tSPEAKER_00\n They...\n\n0:06:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Careful.\n\n0:06:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, came off.\n\n0:06:38\tSPEAKER_00\n The scroll wheel isn't the problem with them not being there.\n\n0:06:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, I don't think he is on the first guy he wants to touch it.\n\n0:06:46\tSPEAKER_03\n My suggestion is we're going to go to the Silver's and Black's, like most of the televisions.\n\n0:06:51\tSPEAKER_03\n You know, some blend of Silver's and Black's.\n\n0:06:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Peep, peep, peep!\n\n0:06:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, enough of that.\n\n0:07:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, that's cool, guys.\n\n0:07:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so are we done with the list presentation?\n\n0:07:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:07:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:07:12\tNone\n No, no.\n\n0:07:14\tSPEAKER_03\n So you're not going to find my folder up there.\n\n0:07:19\tSPEAKER_03\n I've got to do mine up at the board.\n\n0:07:21\tSPEAKER_03\n I have you. Okay.\n\n0:07:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:25\tSPEAKER_03\n So...\n\n0:07:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Can I not get your stuff from your Shared folder, no?\n\n0:07:30\tSPEAKER_03\n No, it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I couldn't create it.\n\n0:07:35\tSPEAKER_03\n I couldn't create it in the PowerPoint.\n\n0:07:38\tSPEAKER_03\n And I think I've got this really strange cable.\n\n0:07:41\tSPEAKER_03\n So what I had basically going from the PowerPoint format is that...\n\n0:07:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, yeah, I like this a lot.\n\n0:07:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to changing situations in the meeting room?\n\n0:08:02\tSPEAKER_03\n So what we had is we had the method.\n\n0:08:08\tSPEAKER_03\n That's not how you spell method, is it?\n\n0:08:11\tSPEAKER_03\n No, eh. No, eh.\n\n0:08:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Come here, you.\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_03\n So this doesn't go so fast this way.\n\n0:08:23\tSPEAKER_03\n And when I speak about method, I speak about the marketing of the product, huh?\n\n0:08:35\tSPEAKER_03\n And to me with this product, we got basically three things to market.\n\n0:08:43\tSPEAKER_03\n We've got the features.\n\n0:08:48\tSPEAKER_03\n We have the characteristics.\n\n0:08:55\tSPEAKER_03\n And we have the...\n\n0:08:58\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know what we call the other part.\n\n0:09:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Would we call...\n\n0:09:03\tSPEAKER_03\n The corporate...\n\n0:09:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Help me.\n\n0:09:10\tSPEAKER_03\n The corporation stands behind the product, okay?\n\n0:09:14\tSPEAKER_03\n So the features, I think, we've got the scroll.\n\n0:09:17\tSPEAKER_03\n We've got the locator.\n\n0:09:20\tSPEAKER_03\n We've got the durability.\n\n0:09:22\tSPEAKER_03\n We've got the dependability.\n\n0:09:25\tSPEAKER_03\n We've got the features that make this a unique product.\n\n0:09:30\tSPEAKER_03\n The characteristics I talk about, we have reliability.\n\n0:09:34\tSPEAKER_03\n We have comfort.\n\n0:09:36\tSPEAKER_03\n We have ergonomics, we have environmentally sensitive.\n\n0:09:41\tSPEAKER_03\n And the corporation we're talking about, we're a new company.\n\n0:09:46\tSPEAKER_03\n We're wanting to make a name for ourselves.\n\n0:09:49\tSPEAKER_03\n We're wanting you to find our product.\n\n0:09:52\tSPEAKER_03\n So we're going to give you a good product at a fair price.\n\n0:09:55\tSPEAKER_03\n One thing I would want to see is...\n\n0:10:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Can we get a lifetime guarantee on this product, a normal use guarantee?\n\n0:10:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Which means that this product for the life of...\n\n0:10:12\tSPEAKER_03\n The life use, if it should have a technical problem that we could replace it at no cost.\n\n0:10:17\tSPEAKER_03\n That would something I would be interested in.\n\n0:10:21\tSPEAKER_03\n So, yeah, without going into great details, we have a product that has the features and the characteristics and the background.\n\n0:10:29\tSPEAKER_03\n I believe to make it marketable.\n\n0:10:31\tSPEAKER_03\n I believe at a cost of 35 to 50 euros, we're going to be competitive.\n\n0:10:40\tSPEAKER_03\n And we're going to have a market niche.\n\n0:10:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Would you... I would do that.\n\n0:10:47\tSPEAKER_00\n We're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down to 25 as we probably could, but lowering the profit margin.\n\n0:10:54\tSPEAKER_03\n That would be, I think, a decision best made by corporate.\n\n0:11:00\tSPEAKER_03\n For my evaluation, based on what our competition is, I think that we can go after this and go after more of the exclusivity sense than the mass market sense.\n\n0:11:18\tSPEAKER_03\n But I'm sure I'm sure open to market this in either direction.\n\n0:11:23\tSPEAKER_03\n But you guys came up with a great product and a debt cost, I think.\n\n0:11:28\tSPEAKER_03\n There's nobody else is putting this combination of ingredients together.\n\n0:11:32\tSPEAKER_03\n The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only.\n\n0:11:39\tSPEAKER_03\n That's the only drawback I see to this.\n\n0:11:41\tSPEAKER_03\n But with all of these other features, I think people...\n\n0:11:45\tSPEAKER_03\n One thing I'm hoping for is people are not going to even notice.\n\n0:11:49\tSPEAKER_03\n There's going to be somebody going home and say, oh, this thing doesn't work for my DVD and my...\n\n0:11:54\tSPEAKER_03\n But I like these other things so they keep it.\n\n0:11:56\tSPEAKER_03\n They don't take it back.\n\n0:11:57\tSPEAKER_00\n And they're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features.\n\n0:12:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Quite simple, anyway. There's no fundamentally different thing.\n\n0:12:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, one of the thoughts that I had is, can this unit be produced in a way that makes it upgradable?\n\n0:12:12\tSPEAKER_03\n You know, like a SIM card in a telephone.\n\n0:12:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Is there a card? Can we make a card?\n\n0:12:21\tSPEAKER_03\n And so after...\n\n0:12:22\tSPEAKER_02\n We need some more buttons if it would work on some other stuff.\n\n0:12:27\tSPEAKER_03\n But you follow one of the...\n\n0:12:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, we could get another version of it that actually works.\n\n0:12:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, because if we can make this unit upgradable, then we're...\n\n0:12:36\tSPEAKER_03\n But then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything.\n\n0:12:39\tSPEAKER_03\n But that was just an idea I had.\n\n0:12:42\tSPEAKER_03\n To meet the only additions...\n\n0:12:44\tSPEAKER_00\n So, the risk of making it unusable as well or making it less.\n\n0:12:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons.\n\n0:12:51\tSPEAKER_00\n You know what they do. It's very simple and it just works.\n\n0:12:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Yep.\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Is there a risk of that?\n\n0:12:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, then anyway, that's...\n\n0:12:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so we can talk about finance now.\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_00\n So I have a little spreadsheet for us where...\n\n0:13:06\tSPEAKER_00\n When you talked about the 15.8 euros, is it as well as how you came up with that figure?\n\n0:13:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, there was just our technical team ended up the production cost of the individual units.\n\n0:13:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so I have a bit of a spreadsheet here for this.\n\n0:13:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh!\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_00\n I've made a few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adapter...\n\n0:13:30\tSPEAKER_00\n We can make for a cost of 4 euros equivalent to solar cells.\n\n0:13:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing...\n\n0:13:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Manufacturing of power adapters already.\n\n0:13:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Uh-huh.\n\n0:13:43\tSPEAKER_00\n And I'm assuming that the locator beacon, you know, the...\n\n0:13:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, BBB.\n\n0:13:50\tSPEAKER_00\n It can be made for...\n\n0:13:52\tSPEAKER_00\n It's something different, I think.\n\n0:13:53\tSPEAKER_00\n It can be made for a similar price to an LLC display.\n\n0:13:58\tSPEAKER_00\n And do you think that's fair coming from a manufacturing?\n\n0:14:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:04\tSPEAKER_01\n I do think we...\n\n0:14:06\tSPEAKER_01\n We don't need the advanced chip and print, we only need the regular chip and print.\n\n0:14:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:14:13\tSPEAKER_01\n There may have been a miscalculation there.\n\n0:14:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:14:20\tSPEAKER_00\n So we're down to 16.4.\n\n0:14:22\tSPEAKER_01\n And we have a single curved.\n\n0:14:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Is that a single curved rather than a double curved?\n\n0:14:29\tSPEAKER_01\n I think that...\n\n0:14:31\tSPEAKER_00\n We're not entirely sure what's saying about that.\n\n0:14:33\tSPEAKER_03\n We've got a curve in a droop, I don't know whether that...\n\n0:14:35\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a single curved.\n\n0:14:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:14:37\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not convinced.\n\n0:14:40\tSPEAKER_00\n We save one euro that way, yeah.\n\n0:14:43\tSPEAKER_00\n So we can bring it down to you.\n\n0:14:46\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's a little bit more than single curved.\n\n0:14:48\tSPEAKER_01\n So yeah, it's 15.8.\n\n0:14:49\tSPEAKER_01\n That's what we came up with it.\n\n0:14:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, hang on, those peaks are...\n\n0:14:54\tSPEAKER_00\n It's in here and we have special forum, don't we?\n\n0:14:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we do.\n\n0:14:59\tSPEAKER_00\n So that's...\n\n0:15:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:01\tSPEAKER_00\n But we haven't talked about any special colour though.\n\n0:15:05\tSPEAKER_00\n If we're going for grazing silver, then it's...\n\n0:15:07\tSPEAKER_01\n That's a very special, it's pretty.\n\n0:15:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so...\n\n0:15:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Piss off at Enscrollfield.\n\n0:15:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Basically, we have...\n\n0:15:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Is this intended to be a button as well?\n\n0:15:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Or just a scroll?\n\n0:15:19\tSPEAKER_00\n There's a scroll.\n\n0:15:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Just a scroll.\n\n0:15:21\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not one of the scrolls where, for example, with this one, you could push it down to be a button.\n\n0:15:25\tSPEAKER_01\n No, we just use it as a scroll.\n\n0:15:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:15:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Then we have 15.8 euros.\n\n0:15:31\tSPEAKER_01\n It was a pretty accurate estimate.\n\n0:15:33\tSPEAKER_02\n It was a bit...\n\n0:15:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, look at it.\n\n0:15:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Awesome.\n\n0:15:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so...\n\n0:15:39\tSPEAKER_00\n We're on to the...\n\n0:15:41\tSPEAKER_00\n It's kind of frighteningly accurate.\n\n0:15:43\tSPEAKER_00\n We're on to the back part of the...\n\n0:15:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Presentation where we have a look...\n\n0:15:49\tSPEAKER_00\n The criteria that Paul has given us.\n\n0:15:55\tSPEAKER_00\n And we can use that to tell...\n\n0:15:59\tSPEAKER_00\n How's it going?\n\n0:16:01\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't get any...\n\n0:16:03\tSPEAKER_00\n What?\n\n0:16:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Thoughts how have we done today?\n\n0:16:06\tSPEAKER_01\n I think we did pretty well.\n\n0:16:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I think we did pretty well too.\n\n0:16:10\tSPEAKER_00\n It looks pretty spectacular.\n\n0:16:11\tSPEAKER_03\n No, I think we came up with a...\n\n0:16:13\tSPEAKER_03\n A tractable...\n\n0:16:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Product and concept.\n\n0:16:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Any other changes?\n\n0:16:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Thoughts?\n\n0:16:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so did the part about...\n\n0:16:39\tSPEAKER_00\n No, for creativity.\n\n0:16:43\tSPEAKER_01\n That was...\n\n0:16:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Nothing very splendid room.\n\n0:16:47\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we got a couple innovative ideas.\n\n0:16:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, well...\n\n0:16:51\tSPEAKER_03\n We kind of broke...\n\n0:16:53\tSPEAKER_03\n We kind of adjusted every criteria they gave us.\n\n0:16:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Because we still have the...\n\n0:17:00\tSPEAKER_03\n The teletext capability in this thing, right?\n\n0:17:03\tSPEAKER_03\n We raised the price of it.\n\n0:17:05\tSPEAKER_03\n We've added two new technology to it.\n\n0:17:07\tSPEAKER_03\n So, you know, if this thing flies, then we've adjusted or broken every...\n\n0:17:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Every idea they gave us.\n\n0:17:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Every idea necessary.\n\n0:17:16\tSPEAKER_00\n It's still at a more control.\n\n0:17:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:17:20\tSPEAKER_00\n No, yeah, but we did break with the specs a little bit, I guess.\n\n0:17:22\tSPEAKER_00\n But the...\n\n0:17:24\tSPEAKER_03\n But I like...\n\n0:17:25\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, what I say, we had...\n\n0:17:26\tSPEAKER_03\n I believe we have room creativity, because this is...\n\n0:17:28\tSPEAKER_03\n We did it.\n\n0:17:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:17:32\tSPEAKER_00\n We just shut the body, we report back to the bosses.\n\n0:17:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I think they were reasonable fights but with us over the whole...\n\n0:17:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Changing the specs thing.\n\n0:17:41\tSPEAKER_02\n And there's more of a teamwork thing than really...\n\n0:17:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Leadership best...\n\n0:17:45\tSPEAKER_02\n I agree.\n\n0:17:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Collusive...\n\n0:17:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Synergy.\n\n0:17:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:17:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Synergistic.\n\n0:17:53\tSPEAKER_00\n That's the lattice synergy.\n\n0:17:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Teamwork.\n\n0:17:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, as...\n\n0:17:59\tSPEAKER_00\n What did we think of the meeting room, I guess, is an important thing here?\n\n0:18:05\tSPEAKER_01\n These cables suck.\n\n0:18:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:09\tSPEAKER_00\n This falls off and...\n\n0:18:11\tSPEAKER_00\n The fightboards work really well with everything.\n\n0:18:13\tSPEAKER_02\n They must have very long shirts.\n\n0:18:15\tSPEAKER_02\n That's way far down lapel, Mike.\n\n0:18:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Wapel.\n\n0:18:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Wapel of lapel.\n\n0:18:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Alright.\n\n0:18:22\tSPEAKER_02\n That's almost a crotch.\n\n0:18:24\tSPEAKER_00\n That's a stone.\n\n0:18:26\tSPEAKER_00\n That's quite close.\n\n0:18:27\tSPEAKER_03\n You know what they're going to have on the recording and they're from that microphone is your lunch digesting.\n\n0:18:31\tSPEAKER_03\n You know?\n\n0:18:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, dear.\n\n0:18:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, dear.\n\n0:18:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, dear.\n\n0:18:37\tSPEAKER_00\n You know more pizza for me.\n\n0:18:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:40\tSPEAKER_00\n So, yeah, the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use, but I guess it works.\n\n0:18:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Because you were using it to upset on.\n\n0:18:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Still, that...\n\n0:18:48\tSPEAKER_00\n That's our boss.\n\n0:18:51\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not convinced of that at all.\n\n0:18:53\tSPEAKER_00\n I've been wondering about that all day, but CDs look like they're...\n\n0:18:57\tSPEAKER_00\n That looks...\n\n0:18:58\tSPEAKER_00\n That looks like it would be that way, right?\n\n0:19:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Major is right.\n\n0:19:01\tSPEAKER_00\n But it feels more comfortable, quite you call up side there.\n\n0:19:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, you're right.\n\n0:19:04\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't care.\n\n0:19:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so that data might be slightly involved.\n\n0:19:08\tSPEAKER_00\n What new ideas have we found?\n\n0:19:11\tSPEAKER_03\n New ideas for the product or for the environment or whatever?\n\n0:19:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, we'll let you both then.\n\n0:19:19\tSPEAKER_00\n For the product?\n\n0:19:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we had the favorites list in the scroll bar and we have the cradle and the remote call feature.\n\n0:19:28\tSPEAKER_02\n We came up with quite a bunch of new ideas.\n\n0:19:31\tSPEAKER_00\n And for the mid-ring room, is anyone getting any more?\n\n0:19:35\tSPEAKER_02\n A comfortable headset would be nice.\n\n0:19:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, I mean, clearly remote control microphones would be a nice solution to all these cables.\n\n0:19:45\tSPEAKER_03\n But I'm sure that there's just some justification for these things that I don't know about.\n\n0:19:50\tSPEAKER_03\n And of course, I didn't have so much fun with my computer this afternoon.\n\n0:19:53\tSPEAKER_03\n It's not been cooperating so well, but I don't think that's the...\n\n0:19:59\tSPEAKER_03\n That's avoidable.\n\n0:20:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Could have been worse.\n\n0:20:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so...\n\n0:20:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Are the costs within the budget?\n\n0:20:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Nope.\n\n0:20:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Nope.\n\n0:20:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, hang on, it really did something with the cost under \u00c2\u00a31250.\n\n0:20:11\tSPEAKER_00\n No, the comments have changed.\n\n0:20:13\tSPEAKER_00\n We're still under \u00c2\u00a320 euros to build, so we're good.\n\n0:20:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Are the costs within the budget?\n\n0:20:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Not the original budget, but they are now.\n\n0:20:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Is the project evaluated?\n\n0:20:24\tSPEAKER_00\n I think so.\n\n0:20:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, then, celebration.\n\n0:20:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Hooray!\n\n0:20:27\tSPEAKER_00\n As it says.\n\n0:20:28\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm sure.\n\n0:20:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Freak up provided at the cafeteria.\n\n0:20:30\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know.\n\n0:20:31\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know how to go down.\n\n0:20:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Err, area.\n\n0:20:33\tSPEAKER_02\n We'll wrote that one.\n\n0:20:37\tSPEAKER_03\n So we need to close this meeting.\n\n0:20:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, problem.\n\n0:20:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Congratulations.\n\n0:20:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Good job, guys.\n\n0:20:42\tSPEAKER_03\n I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on.\n\n0:20:44\tSPEAKER_03\n So close this one.\n\n0:20:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Come back.\n\n0:20:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on.\n\n0:20:48\tNone\n Oops.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "SPEAKER and his colleagues are having a meeting about the
