{"filename": "./data/Bro007.txt", "transcript": "0:00:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, so, today, looking at a number of things we're trying and, fortunately, for listeners to this, some of it's visual, but got tables in front of us. What is combo mean? So, combo\n\n0:00:37\tSPEAKER_04\n is a system where we have these features that go through the network and then these same three more features, but low pass filter with the low pass filter use in the MSG features.\n\n0:00:53\tSPEAKER_04\n So these low pass filter goes through another MLB and then the linear outputs of these two MLBs are combined just by adding the values and then there is this guilty and the output\n\n0:01:10\tSPEAKER_03\n is used as features. So, let me try to restate this and see if I have it right. There's the features, there's the OGI features and then those features go through a contextual, let's take this bottom arrow, one point by the bottom arrow. Those features go through a contextualized KLT. Then these features also get low pass filtered.\n\n0:01:56\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, so, yeah, I could grab through this and blackboard. Yeah, that's good. So, we have these features from OGI that goes through three paths, three, okay. The first is a KLT using several frames of the features. The second path is MLB, also using nine frames, several frame of features. The third path is this low pass filter, MLB. Adding the output is just like in the second proposal for the first evaluation. And then MLB and those\n\n0:02:58\tSPEAKER_03\n two together. Okay, so that's this bottom one. And then the one at the top and I presume these things that are in yellow are in yellow because overall they're the best. Yeah, that's the reason. Oh, that's focused on them. So, what's the block diagram for the one above it?\n\n0:03:25\tSPEAKER_04\n For the first yellow line, you mean? Yeah. So, it's basically the same except that we don't have this low pass filtering. So, we have only two streams. Well, there's no low pass processing. Use this additional feature stream. Do you, they mentioned, when I was\n\n0:03:57\tSPEAKER_03\n on the phone, what's the note? They mentioned some waiting scheme that was used to evaluate\n\n0:04:04\tSPEAKER_04\n all these numbers. Actually, the waiting seems to... Well, it's 40% 40, I think it's 60% for all the speech that comes with all these languages. The well-match is 40, medium 35, even. I miss much 25. And we don't have the TI digits. No. Okay. But yeah, generally what we observe with TI digits is that the result are very close, whatever the system. Okay.\n\n0:04:42\tSPEAKER_03\n And so, have you put all these numbers together into a single number representing that?\n\n0:04:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Not yet. Okay. So, that should be pretty easy to do. Yeah. And that would be good to make a compare the two and say what was better. Yeah. And how does this compare to the numbers?\n\n0:05:01\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, so, OGI2 is just the top. Yeah. Top row. So, yeah. So, actually, OGI2 is the baseline with the OGI features. But this is not exactly the result that they have because they've still made some changes in the features. Okay. But actually, our results are better than their results. I don't know by how much because they did not send us their new results.\n\n0:05:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay. Okay. So, the one place where it looks like we're messing things up a bit is in\n\n0:05:50\tSPEAKER_04\n the highly mismatched Italian. Yeah. Yeah. There is something for any of you here because there are 36 and then sometimes we are around 42. Now, one of the ideas that you had mentioned\n\n0:06:28\tSPEAKER_03\n last time was having a second silence detection. Yeah. So, there are some results here.\n\n0:06:37\tSPEAKER_04\n So, the third and the fifth line of the table. So, felt is what that is. Yeah. So, it seems for the well-matched mismatched condition, it brings something. But, actually, apparently there is no room left for any silence detector at the server side because of the delay.\n\n0:07:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, we can't do it. Okay. Yeah. Too bad. Good idea. But, anyway. Okay. Except, I don't know\n\n0:07:22\tSPEAKER_04\n because I think they are still working well. Two days ago, they were still working on this, trying to reduce the delay of the silence detector. So, but yeah, if we had time perhaps, we could try to find some kind of compromise between the delay that's on the end set and on the server side, but try to reduce the delay on the end set. But, well, for a moment, they have this large delay on the feature computation. Okay. So, all right. So, for now,\n\n0:08:00\tSPEAKER_03\n at least that's not there. You have some results with low pass filter, capstone. It doesn't have a huge effect, but it looks like it maybe can help in a couple places. Yeah. A little bit. And, yeah. And, let's see. Well, just that we have in there. I guess, at this point, this is, I guess I should probably look at these others a little bit. You yellow these out, but, oh, I see, yeah, that one you can't use because of the delay. That looks pretty good. Let's see. That one.\n\n0:09:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, even just the second row doesn't look that bad, right? That's just, that looks\n\n0:09:22\tSPEAKER_04\n like an interesting one, too. Actually, the second line is pretty much like the first line in yellow, except that we don't have this guilty on the first, on the left part of the diagram, just add the features. Yeah. Yeah. So, when we do this weighted measure,\n\n0:09:57\tSPEAKER_03\n we should compare the two because it might even do not better. And, it's a little slightly simpler. So, there's, so I would put that one also as a maybe. And, yeah. And, it's actually, it does, does significantly better on the highly mismatched Italian. So, and love a worse on the, it's on the MM case, but, well, yeah, it's worse on a few things.\n\n0:10:37\tSPEAKER_03\n So, see how that, see how that comes out on their measure. And, are we running this for TI digits or? Yeah. Now, is TI, is that part of the result that they get for the development, the results that they're supposed to get at the end of the month, the TI digits are there also? It's here. Okay. Okay. Let's see what else there is here. Oh, I see the one that I was looking down here at the row below the lower yellow one. That's, that's with the reduced KLT size. Yeah, reduced functionality. What happens there is it's around the same.\n\n0:11:38\tSPEAKER_03\n And so, you could reduce the dimension. What you're saying? Yeah, it's, it's, it's significant, but, but it's significantly worse. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's mostly worse. Yeah. I did this a little, I mean, not, not by a huge amount. I don't know.\n\n0:12:03\tSPEAKER_03\n What, what are the sizes of any of these sets? I'm sure you told me before, but I forgot.\n\n0:12:10\tSPEAKER_03\n So, you know, how many words are in one of these test sets? Yeah. Well, it depends, well,\n\n0:12:23\tSPEAKER_04\n the one much is generally larger than the other sets. And I think it's a row. Two thousand, two thousand, two thousand. What? I don't know. Sentences. Sentences. Some sets have 500\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_03\n sentences. Yeah. So, so the sets, so the test sets are between 500 and 2,000 sentences, let's say, each sentence on the average has four or five digits or is it most of them\n\n0:12:56\tSPEAKER_02\n longer? Yeah. For Italian, even 70, but sometimes the sentences have only one digit and three times, like the number of credit cards, something like that. Right. So, between one and 16, see\n\n0:13:17\tSPEAKER_03\n the, I mean, the reason I'm asking is is we have all these small differences and I don't know how seriously to take them right. So, yeah. If you had, just, you know, to give an example, if you had, if you had a thousand words, then a tenth of a percent would just be one word, right. So, so, it means anything. So, yeah, be kind of, I can't, I can know what the sizes of these tests are. The size of the, yeah. Since these, well, also just to know the numbers, right. So, these, these are word error rates. So, this is on how many words.\n\n0:14:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah. We have the result of the output of the H-tika. Yeah. The number of sentences, not\n\n0:14:09\tSPEAKER_03\n the numbers. Yeah, sure. Yeah. So, anyway, if you could just mail out what those numbers are and then that would be great. What else is there here? See, the second, the second from the bottom, it says S-I-L. This is some different type of silence or thing. What\n\n0:14:29\tSPEAKER_02\n was that? The output silence of the MLP. It's only one small experiment to know what happened. To fly also, to include also the silence of the MLP. We have the 56 phone and the silence to pick up the silence and to include also. This silence plus the K-L-T output.\n\n0:14:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, so you're only using the silence? Yeah, because when we apply the K-L-T output.\n\n0:15:00\tSPEAKER_04\n No, I think there is this silence in addition to the K-L-T output. In addition to the K-L-T output.\n\n0:15:05\tSPEAKER_04\n Because we, we just keep, we don't keep all the dimensions after the K-L-T. And we're not sure if we try to add the silence also in addition to the 28 dimensions. Okay. What, what's OGI 45? It's OGI 2. It's the features from the first line. Yes. Right, but I mean, what is the last row mean? So, it's basically this, but without the K-L-T on the left. I\n\n0:15:53\tSPEAKER_03\n thought that was the one. I thought that was the second row. What's the difference between\n\n0:16:01\tSPEAKER_04\n the second line? You don't have these combos stuff, so you just... Oh, so this is like the\n\n0:16:07\tSPEAKER_02\n second line, but with the combo stuff. And with the output of the combo. Yeah. Okay, so,\n\n0:16:15\tSPEAKER_03\n all right, so it looks to me, I guess, the same given that we have to take the field ones out of the running because of this delay problem. It looks to me like the ones you said, I agree, there are the ones to look at, but it just would add the second row. Yeah. One. And then, if we can... Oh, yeah, also, when they're using this weighting scheme of 40, 35, 25, is that on the percentages or on the raw errors, I guess it's probably on the percentages, right?\n\n0:17:04\tSPEAKER_04\n I guess, yeah. Yeah, I kind of guess. All right, it's that query. Okay, maybe they'll argue about it.\n\n0:17:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, so if we know how many words are in each, and then they've, they've promised to get something tomorrow, which will be there as far as they've gotten, right? And we'll operate with that.\n\n0:17:28\tSPEAKER_03\n How long did it... I guess if we're not doing all these things, if we're only doing...\n\n0:17:33\tSPEAKER_03\n I guess since this is development data, it's legitimate to do more than one, right?\n\n0:17:48\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, or now, if in final test data, you don't want to do several and take the best. That's that's not proper, but if this is development data, we could still look at a couple. Yeah.\n\n0:17:59\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, we can, yeah, sure. But we have to decide, I mean, we have to fix the system.\n\n0:18:05\tSPEAKER_04\n Yes, on this data. Choose the best. Right. The question is when do we fix the system?\n\n0:18:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Do we fix the system tomorrow, or do we fix the system on Tuesday?\n\n0:18:16\tSPEAKER_03\n I think we fix on Tuesday, yeah. Okay, except that we do have to write it up.\n\n0:18:19\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, well, basically it's this way. Perhaps some kind of printing on some of the pets.\n\n0:18:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Right, so maybe what we do is we get the data from them, we start the training and so forth, but we start the write-up right away, because as you say, there's only minor differences between these.\n\n0:18:46\tSPEAKER_04\n I think we could start to, yeah. Yeah, there's something. Yeah.\n\n0:18:51\tSPEAKER_03\n And I would, yeah, I would kind of like to see it. Maybe I can add it a bit.\n\n0:18:58\tSPEAKER_03\n The money in the situation is my forte, which is English.\n\n0:19:07\tSPEAKER_03\n So, yeah, have you seen, do they have a format for how they want the system descriptions or anything? Not really. Okay.\n\n0:19:20\tSPEAKER_04\n There is the format of the table, which is quite impressive.\n\n0:19:33\tSPEAKER_03\n I see. Yes, for those who are listening to this and not looking at it, it's not really that impressive, it's just tiny.\n\n0:19:40\tSPEAKER_03\n It's all these little categories.\n\n0:19:45\tSPEAKER_03\n So they said B, said C, multi-conditioned clean.\n\n0:19:52\tSPEAKER_03\n No mitigation. Wow.\n\n0:19:56\tSPEAKER_03\n You know what, no, no mitigation means.\n\n0:20:01\tSPEAKER_04\n It should be...\n\n0:20:05\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, that's probably the general error.\n\n0:20:07\tSPEAKER_03\n This is probably a channel error stuff.\n\n0:20:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, this is... Right, it says right above your channel error resilience.\n\n0:20:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:16\tSPEAKER_03\n So recognition performance is just the top part, actually.\n\n0:20:23\tSPEAKER_03\n And they have the aspect between scene databases and non-scene, so basically, due development and evaluation.\n\n0:20:30\tSPEAKER_03\n And so, right, it's presumed there's all sorts of tuning that's gone on on the...\n\n0:20:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Let's see what they call scene databases.\n\n0:20:38\tSPEAKER_03\n And there won't be tuning for the unseen...\n\n0:20:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Multi-condition. Multi-condition.\n\n0:20:52\tSPEAKER_03\n So they have... Looks like they have...\n\n0:21:01\tSPEAKER_03\n So they're splitting up between the TI digits and everything else, I say.\n\n0:21:05\tSPEAKER_03\n So they everything else is the speech debt car. That's the...\n\n0:21:09\tSPEAKER_04\n Multi-conditioned. Yeah, so it's not divided between languages, you mean, or...\n\n0:21:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, it is. It is. But there's also these tables over here for the TI digits and these tables over here for the car, which is, which is, I guess, all the multi-lingual stuff.\n\n0:21:22\tSPEAKER_03\n And then there's...\n\n0:21:25\tSPEAKER_03\n They also split up between multi-conditioned and clean only.\n\n0:21:29\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay. Forty-indigets. Yeah. Actually, yeah. Forty-indigets, they want to train clean and unnoisy.\n\n0:21:40\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:44\tSPEAKER_03\n So we're doing that also, I guess.\n\n0:21:47\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah. But...\n\n0:21:50\tSPEAKER_04\n We actually... Do we have the features? Yeah, for the clean-conditioned, but we did not test it yet.\n\n0:21:57\tSPEAKER_04\n The clean training stuff.\n\n0:22:01\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:22:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, anyway, sounds like there'll be a lot to do just to work with our partners to fill out the tables for the next few days. I guess they have to send it out. See, the 31st is Wednesday.\n\n0:22:21\tSPEAKER_03\n And I think it has to be there by some hour European time on Wednesday. So I think basically...\n\n0:22:28\tSPEAKER_02\n It was a long time when they maybe, because... Excuse me?\n\n0:22:32\tSPEAKER_02\n That the difference in the time may be... It's so long different of the time. Maybe the 12th of the night of the Thursday one is not valid in Europe. We don't know exactly.\n\n0:22:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah. So I mean, I think we have to actually get it on Tuesday, because I think...\n\n0:22:58\tSPEAKER_04\n Except if it's the 31st of midnight, we don't know.\n\n0:23:02\tSPEAKER_04\n Can't still do some work on Wednesday.\n\n0:23:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, well... Is it been... I thought it was actually something like 5pm on...\n\n0:23:14\tSPEAKER_03\n It was like, I thought it was 5pm or something. I didn't think it was midnight.\n\n0:23:17\tSPEAKER_03\n I thought they said they wanted it at 5pm.\n\n0:23:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, so 5pm their time is...\n\n0:23:24\tSPEAKER_02\n No, like 3pm. 3pm.\n\n0:23:26\tSPEAKER_02\n 3pm. 3pm.\n\n0:23:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Alright, that's six in the morning here.\n\n0:23:30\tSPEAKER_02\n No. 3... 3... 8... 3pm?\n\n0:23:33\tSPEAKER_04\n No, we were wondering about the... the... the... the... the... the... the... we have to...\n\n0:23:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n0:23:38\tSPEAKER_04\n I don't know if it's 3pm.\n\n0:23:40\tSPEAKER_02\n 3pm here is in Europe, with 9.\n\n0:23:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it's 3pm here.\n\n0:23:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, it's 3pm here. But I didn't think it was midnight that it was...\n\n0:23:45\tNone\n Oh.\n\n0:23:45\tSPEAKER_03\n I thought it was due it's some hour during the day, like 5pm or something.\n\n0:23:50\tSPEAKER_03\n In which case...\n\n0:23:52\tSPEAKER_03\n So I... well, we should look, but my assumption is that we basically have to be done Tuesday.\n\n0:23:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah. So, then next Thursday we can sort of have a little aftermath.\n\n0:24:03\tSPEAKER_03\n But then we'll actually have the new day, which is the German and the Danish.\n\n0:24:07\tSPEAKER_03\n But that really will be much less work, because the system will be fixed.\n\n0:24:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:13\tSPEAKER_03\n So all we'll do is take whatever they have and...\n\n0:24:18\tSPEAKER_03\n and run it through the process.\n\n0:24:20\tSPEAKER_03\n We won't be changing the training on anything.\n\n0:24:23\tSPEAKER_03\n So there'll be no new training, there'll just be new HDK runs.\n\n0:24:26\tSPEAKER_03\n So that means in some sense we can kind of relax from this after Tuesday.\n\n0:24:33\tSPEAKER_03\n And maybe next meeting we can start talking a little bit about where we want to go from here in terms of the research.\n\n0:24:46\tSPEAKER_03\n You know, what things...\n\n0:24:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Did you think of when you were doing this process that just didn't really have time to adequately work on?\n\n0:25:03\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, Stefan always had these great ideas.\n\n0:25:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, but I would have time.\n\n0:25:12\tSPEAKER_04\n I'm not sure the other great ideas.\n\n0:25:14\tSPEAKER_04\n That's right.\n\n0:25:16\tSPEAKER_02\n But there are ideas.\n\n0:25:17\tSPEAKER_02\n It was a great idea.\n\n0:25:19\tSPEAKER_02\n To apply the sick guilty was a great idea.\n\n0:25:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that was good.\n\n0:25:25\tSPEAKER_03\n And also it's still true that I think it's true that we at least got fairly consistent improve results by running the neural net transformation in parallel with the features rather than in sequence which was your suggestion and that seems to have been born out.\n\n0:25:50\tSPEAKER_03\n The fact that none of these are enormous is not too surprising.\n\n0:25:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Most improvements aren't enormous.\n\n0:26:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Some of them are.\n\n0:26:01\tSPEAKER_03\n But when you have something really, really wrong and you fix it, you can get really enormous improvements.\n\n0:26:15\tSPEAKER_03\n It's our best improvements over the years that we've gotten from finding bugs.\n\n0:26:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, well, I think I see where we are and everybody knows what they're doing.\n\n0:26:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Is there anything else we should talk about?\n\n0:26:34\tSPEAKER_04\n I think it's okay.\n\n0:26:38\tSPEAKER_04\n So basically we will, I think we will try to focus on these three architectures.\n\n0:26:48\tSPEAKER_04\n And perhaps I was thinking also a fourth one with just a single guilty because we did not really test that removing these guiltys in particular single guilty at the end.\n\n0:27:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I mean that would be pretty low maintenance to try it if you can fit it in.\n\n0:27:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, I have, yeah, I do have one other piece of information which should tell people outside of this group too.\n\n0:27:17\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know if we're going to need it.\n\n0:27:18\tSPEAKER_03\n But Jeff at the University of Washington has gotten a hold of some kind of server farm of 10 multi-processor IBM machines or 6,000s.\n\n0:27:39\tSPEAKER_03\n And so I think each one is four processors or something.\n\n0:27:43\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know, 800 megahertz or something. There's four processors in a box and there's 10 boxes and there's some kind of type. So he's got a lot of processing power.\n\n0:27:53\tSPEAKER_03\n And we'd have to schedule it but if we have some big jobs and we want to run them, he's offering it.\n\n0:28:01\tSPEAKER_03\n So it's a, when he was here, he used not only every machine here but every machine on campus as far as I could tell. So it's got his payback. But again, I don't know if we'll end up with if we're going to be CPU limited and anything that we're doing in this group but if we are, that's an offer.\n\n0:28:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, well, guys doing great stuff. So that's really neat.\n\n0:28:38\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't think we need to.\n\n0:28:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, well, the other thing I guess that I will say is that the digits that we're going to record momentarily are starting to get into a pretty good size collection.\n\n0:28:53\tSPEAKER_03\n And in addition to the speech data stuff, we will have those to work with really pretty soon now.\n\n0:29:02\tSPEAKER_03\n So that's another source of data which is, understand what better control and that we can make measurements of the room that, you know, if we feel there's other measurements we don't have, we'd like to have.
