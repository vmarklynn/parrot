It went that way.\n\n0:00:50\tSPEAKER_03\n It is, ok.\n\n0:00:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh!\n\n0:01:06\tNone\n This is too heavy.\n\n0:01:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Do you have any booths?\n\n0:01:29\tSPEAKER_03\n You ready back there?\n\n0:01:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:01:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Welcome everyone.\n\n0:01:49\tSPEAKER_03\n This is the kickoff meeting for the day.\n\n0:01:52\tSPEAKER_03\n We're the new group to create a new remote control for real reaction.\n\n0:02:01\tSPEAKER_03\n As you can see, our agenda is to open up the meeting, become acquainted with each other, have a little training on tools, create a plan, discuss things, and we only have 25 minutes total.\n\n0:02:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, the new remote control is to be original, trendy, and user friendly.\n\n0:02:26\tSPEAKER_03\n That step is your part, is the user friendliness, the originality.\n\n0:02:30\tSPEAKER_03\n It's going to take all of us.\n\n0:02:34\tSPEAKER_03\n The trendiness will probably get look at some marketing research information from you, Sarah.\n\n0:02:42\tSPEAKER_03\n And we'll get on with it.\n\n0:02:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:02:45\tSPEAKER_03\n So a functional design, individual work, both meeting, and then conceptual design, and then detailed design.\n\n0:02:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:02:57\tNone\n Right.\n\n0:02:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard.\n\n0:03:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Kate, why don't you try it first if you can either bring your things with you.\n\n0:03:10\tSPEAKER_03\n I guess.\n\n0:03:11\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm not going to do anything else, and while you're doing that, we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well.\n\n0:03:19\tNone\n I'm just rocking and walking around.\n\n0:03:23\tNone\n Right.\n\n0:03:24\tSPEAKER_02\n So you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal.\n\n0:03:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you have to be able to recognize what animal it is?\n\n0:03:38\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't think so, I think it's just to try out the whiteboard.\n\n0:03:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, we're all going to draw a cat.\n\n0:03:52\tSPEAKER_01\n I know.\n\n0:03:53\tSPEAKER_01\n I know.\n\n0:03:54\tSPEAKER_02\n I know.\n\n0:03:55\tSPEAKER_02\n I know.\n\n0:03:56\tSPEAKER_02\n I know.\n\n0:03:57\tSPEAKER_02\n I know.\n\n0:03:58\tNone\n I know.\n\n0:03:59\tNone\n I know.\n\n0:04:00\tNone\n I know.\n\n0:04:01\tSPEAKER_02\n I know.\n\n0:04:02\tSPEAKER_02\n I know.\n\n0:04:03\tSPEAKER_02\n I know.\n\n0:04:04\tSPEAKER_02\n I know.\n\n0:04:05\tSPEAKER_02\n I know.\n\n0:04:06\tSPEAKER_02\n I know.\n\n0:04:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Um, especially if you should have a mouth as well.\n\n0:04:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:04:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:04:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Great.\n\n0:04:14\tSPEAKER_02\n And the characteristics.\n\n0:04:15\tSPEAKER_02\n And the characteristics.\n\n0:04:16\tSPEAKER_02\n And the characteristics of the cat, the whiskers, I think, because they're the easiest to draw.\n\n0:04:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Ah.\n\n0:04:24\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll give it a small detail.\n\n0:04:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Fantastic.\n\n0:04:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Since you're handy as well, once you do yours and that's what I'm going to do, I'm going to do it.\n\n0:04:34\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it's to get us used to using the pen.\n\n0:04:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Sure, it's not to test our artistic.\n\n0:04:51\tSPEAKER_02\n But no.\n\n0:04:54\tNone\n It's a mouth.\n\n0:04:57\tNone\n A mouthsy.\n\n0:04:58\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not a mysina.\n\n0:04:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Not a mouthsy.\n\n0:05:00\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not a mysina.\n\n0:05:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Not a mouthsy.\n\n0:05:06\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a one bat.\n\n0:05:11\tNone\n So, erty.\n\n0:05:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Ah.\n\n0:05:15\tSPEAKER_01\n A wood.\n\n0:05:16\tSPEAKER_02\n A rat.\n\n0:05:17\tSPEAKER_03\n A wet.\n\n0:05:18\tSPEAKER_03\n A wet.\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_03\n A wet.\n\n0:05:20\tSPEAKER_03\n A wet.\n\n0:05:21\tSPEAKER_01\n A wet.\n\n0:05:22\tSPEAKER_01\n A wet.\n\n0:05:23\tSPEAKER_01\n A wet.\n\n0:05:24\tSPEAKER_01\n A wet.\n\n0:05:25\tSPEAKER_01\n A wet.\n\n0:05:26\tSPEAKER_01\n A wet.\n\n0:05:27\tSPEAKER_01\n A wet.\n\n0:05:28\tNone\n A wet.\n\n0:05:29\tSPEAKER_03\n A wet.\n\n0:05:30\tSPEAKER_03\n And your favourite characteristics of that animal?\n\n0:05:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Er, dead intelligent and a jiki and a fantastic pet.\n\n0:05:40\tSPEAKER_01\n A very friendly.\n\n0:05:41\tSPEAKER_01\n OK.\n\n0:05:42\tSPEAKER_01\n And they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework.\n\n0:05:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Thanks.\n\n0:05:54\tNone\n Oh, a fish.\n\n0:06:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Gosh, why didn't I think of fish that's even a nice little cat?\n\n0:06:28\tSPEAKER_00\n This is very representational.\n\n0:06:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, OK.\n\n0:06:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Fine.\n\n0:06:32\tSPEAKER_00\n I like them because they're sleek and they have a lot of freedom that they also do swimming groups.\n\n0:06:41\tSPEAKER_00\n So, you have a few elements.\n\n0:06:45\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm afraid I'm with Steph.\n\n0:06:54\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't think you're pen running out of whatever.\n\n0:06:59\tSPEAKER_03\n But I'm afraid I take the cowards way out and the cat's looking the other way.\n\n0:07:09\tSPEAKER_03\n He's hiding.\n\n0:07:12\tSPEAKER_03\n So sometimes very independent, my parents had cats.\n\n0:07:18\tSPEAKER_03\n And they can decide for themselves what is best.\n\n0:07:28\tSPEAKER_03\n OK.\n\n0:07:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Now, we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this.\n\n0:07:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Which this remote control has to be sold.\n\n0:07:46\tSPEAKER_03\n We're to sell it for 25 euros with a profit aim ultimately of 50 million euros.\n\n0:07:55\tSPEAKER_03\n That tells you something about how many we have to sell on an international scale.\n\n0:08:03\tSPEAKER_03\n We'd be off a lot of these, we'd be like 100 million of them to make 25 euros on each one and make a total profit of 50 million.\n\n0:08:16\tSPEAKER_03\n The production is to only cost 12.5 euros per item.\n\n0:08:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Now, if the cost 12.5, you're selling it for 25, you're making 12.5 euros each.\n\n0:08:32\tSPEAKER_03\n And we're to make a profit of 50 million.\n\n0:08:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Can you do the math and how many you're always selling?\n\n0:08:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:41\tSPEAKER_00\n I was just wondering if that's the 50% is normal markup.\n\n0:08:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:49\tSPEAKER_00\n I would think we'll do more like 60%.\n\n0:08:51\tSPEAKER_00\n OK.\n\n0:08:52\tSPEAKER_00\n But the need for that's 50%.\n\n0:08:56\tSPEAKER_00\n And as your question is, how many do we have to sell?\n\n0:09:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, because our market is international and your problem has to do with marketing.\n\n0:09:09\tSPEAKER_03\n You've got to know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have target and who is that?\n\n0:09:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:18\tSPEAKER_03\n That's to give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking.\n\n0:09:22\tSPEAKER_03\n So that's 4 million of them.\n\n0:09:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Something like that.\n\n0:09:27\tSPEAKER_03\n OK.\n\n0:09:29\tSPEAKER_03\n That's 50 million euros.\n\n0:09:31\tSPEAKER_03\n You're making 50 million euros and you're only getting 12.5 each.\n\n0:09:38\tSPEAKER_03\n That's a lot of selling.\n\n0:09:42\tSPEAKER_03\n That's 4.\n\n0:09:46\tSPEAKER_03\n To be 50, be 4 million.\n\n0:09:50\tSPEAKER_03\n You have to sell 4 million.\n\n0:09:53\tSPEAKER_03\n OK.\n\n0:09:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:09:57\tSPEAKER_03\n So, I think that's the only thing that I can do.\n\n0:10:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Experience with a remote control.\n\n0:10:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Any of you use a remote control for television or DVD or something?\n\n0:10:09\tSPEAKER_03\n That's the same tool.\n\n0:10:10\tSPEAKER_02\n So what are we talking about?\n\n0:10:11\tSPEAKER_02\n We'll work for a no-home environment.\n\n0:10:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time.\n\n0:10:23\tSPEAKER_03\n But I also have heard about them not working well or not well coordinated and you wind up working with this one for this three.\n\n0:10:30\tSPEAKER_03\n And then this one over here for another.\n\n0:10:32\tSPEAKER_01\n It's true that you're sitting there.\n\n0:10:33\tSPEAKER_01\n You're sitting on your sofa and you want to change something.\n\n0:10:36\tSPEAKER_01\n But it's five different remote.\n\n0:10:37\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a one for the DVD and one for the video and one for cable and one for everything.\n\n0:10:43\tSPEAKER_01\n But it's a business.\n\n0:10:44\tSPEAKER_01\n But it's a business.\n\n0:10:45\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a business just for television.\n\n0:10:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Don't know.\n\n0:10:50\tSPEAKER_03\n OK.\n\n0:10:51\tSPEAKER_03\n So, ideas for them in the mode.\n\n0:10:54\tSPEAKER_03\n What would it be for and what group would be for?\n\n0:11:00\tSPEAKER_03\n We have to think about that one.\n\n0:11:03\tSPEAKER_00\n We could make a Hello Kitty famed remote.\n\n0:11:06\tSPEAKER_01\n I think we're going to write colors with tickets.\n\n0:11:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:11\tSPEAKER_00\n We could totally go for the Japana nation.\n\n0:11:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, I mean there's also the Keshe that the Japanese make great products, electrical, their industrial designs.\n\n0:11:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Very good.\n\n0:11:25\tSPEAKER_01\n I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions.\n\n0:11:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Like, I've got one at home that has, well, apart from the obvious channels, channel up, channel down volume, you know, subtitles mute.\n\n0:11:42\tSPEAKER_01\n There's a lot of buttons that I've got no idea what they do.\n\n0:11:47\tSPEAKER_00\n That's a really good point because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate, we tend to go to menus and then make choices.\n\n0:11:56\tSPEAKER_00\n So, if it's like a volume button, you can go in and say mute or volume.\n\n0:12:02\tSPEAKER_00\n We don't need to have like the numbers.\n\n0:12:05\tSPEAKER_00\n We also have a channel up channel down.\n\n0:12:09\tSPEAKER_00\n OK.\n\n0:12:10\tSPEAKER_00\n We can make it smart, like an iPod.\n\n0:12:17\tNone\n Make it make it menus.\n\n0:12:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, closing easy.\n\n0:12:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:26\tSPEAKER_03\n I know this sounds like it was very quick, but the, I think that's the industrial design is the first one that's Kate for the working design and user that's used Steph for the technical functions design and for marketing the user requirements specification.\n\n0:12:52\tSPEAKER_03\n I think there's going to be a lot of, we have to help each other and work through this as a group.\n\n0:12:58\tSPEAKER_03\n And I think we all, you know, we like our Kitakatt and our Rat and our Fish, but I think we all have to like each other to get this done.\n\n0:13:09\tSPEAKER_03\n As it says, we're going to get individual instructions, but I don't think they will out a lot of extra time.\n\n0:13:15\tSPEAKER_03\n So I think a little bit of less of this and more it do set us in good stead.\n\n0:13:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Do you all agree?\n\n0:13:23\tSPEAKER_03\n All right.\n\n0:13:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Then I don't see any reason to prolong it.\n\n0:13:30\tSPEAKER_03\n And we should finish this meeting right now and go into other things.\n\n0:13:35\tSPEAKER_03\n All right.\n\n0:13:36\tSPEAKER_03\n So this is the end of the first meeting.\n\n0:13:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Thank you all.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "The new group is meeting to create a new remote
