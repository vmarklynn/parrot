know what I mean inside just In this place retreating without trying to learn how to capture I don't know but inside of that\n\n0:01:50\tNone\n If you're falling mad and those would What do we have to do?\n\n0:02:00\tSPEAKER_03\n First, I want to say I'm the secretary, so I make the minutes.\n\n0:02:06\tSPEAKER_03\n You find them in your map, in the group, just minutes from the first meeting.\n\n0:02:16\tSPEAKER_03\n You'll find the next minutes also there.\n\n0:02:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Then, I want to hear from you what you've done.\n\n0:02:26\tSPEAKER_03\n And after that, I have some new products, requirements.\n\n0:02:32\tSPEAKER_03\n And after that, we have to make decisions what we will do.\n\n0:02:38\tSPEAKER_03\n And then we're ready.\n\n0:02:40\tSPEAKER_03\n We have 40 minutes for this meeting.\n\n0:02:44\tSPEAKER_03\n After that, we'll have lunch.\n\n0:02:46\tSPEAKER_03\n So first, I want to ask the...\n\n0:02:54\tSPEAKER_03\n...industrial designer to tell what he did.\n\n0:03:00\tSPEAKER_03\n That's my task.\n\n0:03:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:03:04\tSPEAKER_02\n What have I put it?\n\n0:03:10\tSPEAKER_02\n My documents are not.\n\n0:03:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Hmm.\n\n0:03:24\tSPEAKER_02\n I've saved it on my computer, my presentation.\n\n0:03:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, on your computer or...\n\n0:03:30\tSPEAKER_03\n But where?\n\n0:03:32\tSPEAKER_02\n What's the name?\n\n0:03:34\tSPEAKER_02\n What's the name of it?\n\n0:03:42\tSPEAKER_02\n It was about the working of the remote control.\n\n0:03:50\tSPEAKER_03\n It's the technical function or the functional requirements.\n\n0:03:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Nope.\n\n0:03:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's kick off.\n\n0:04:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Working design.\n\n0:04:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Working...\n\n0:04:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Now, I don't know where it is.\n\n0:04:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Hmm.\n\n0:04:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Working design.\n\n0:04:34\tSPEAKER_03\n It is the product documents.\n\n0:04:40\tSPEAKER_02\n And I'm part of this until...\n\n0:04:46\tSPEAKER_03\n...in desktop.\n\n0:04:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Up.\n\n0:04:54\tSPEAKER_03\n One, up.\n\n0:04:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Up.\n\n0:05:00\tSPEAKER_03\n My documents.\n\n0:05:04\tSPEAKER_03\n What the fuck is this?\n\n0:05:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh yeah.\n\n0:05:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh yeah.\n\n0:05:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh boy.\n\n0:05:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Working design.\n\n0:05:22\tSPEAKER_02\n That's the empty one.\n\n0:05:26\tSPEAKER_02\n And I had one.\n\n0:05:28\tSPEAKER_02\n I had one.\n\n0:05:36\tSPEAKER_02\n I had one.\n\n0:05:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:05:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Here it is.\n\n0:05:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Not a ticket.\n\n0:05:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:06:00\tNone\n A little later, but here it is.\n\n0:06:08\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:06:14\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a little difficult.\n\n0:06:16\tSPEAKER_02\n What I'm going to tell you.\n\n0:06:18\tSPEAKER_02\n It's about the working of the remote control.\n\n0:06:22\tSPEAKER_02\n I just had half an hour to study it.\n\n0:06:26\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't get it.\n\n0:06:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Ten minutes to tell it.\n\n0:06:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:06:32\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it will be a few minutes.\n\n0:06:34\tSPEAKER_02\n First, I will tell you something about the findings.\n\n0:06:36\tSPEAKER_02\n What I discovered about the remote control.\n\n0:06:38\tSPEAKER_02\n The working of it.\n\n0:06:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Then I'll have some kind of map.\n\n0:06:46\tSPEAKER_02\n So, I'll talk about the remote control.\n\n0:06:50\tSPEAKER_02\n With a little bit of science.\n\n0:06:54\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll show it in a few minutes.\n\n0:06:58\tSPEAKER_02\n And then what I'll think about it.\n\n0:07:02\tSPEAKER_02\n First, the findings.\n\n0:07:04\tSPEAKER_02\n The remote control is a very difficult thing to explain.\n\n0:07:08\tSPEAKER_02\n To just all of you who haven't seen a remote control inside.\n\n0:07:12\tSPEAKER_02\n I've seen it because it's not so expensive.\n\n0:07:16\tSPEAKER_02\n And there are a lot of wires.\n\n0:07:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Which connect the components in it, the battery, and switches and things like that.\n\n0:07:30\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a lot of small electronics.\n\n0:07:32\tSPEAKER_02\n So, it won't be too expensive to build it.\n\n0:07:36\tSPEAKER_02\n And the 12 euro 50, I think, will make it.\n\n0:07:42\tSPEAKER_02\n And here I have the top of the remote control.\n\n0:07:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Here's some kind of chip.\n\n0:07:48\tSPEAKER_02\n On top of this, there are the numbers.\n\n0:07:52\tSPEAKER_02\n You have all on your remote control.\n\n0:07:56\tSPEAKER_02\n And the teletext button.\n\n0:07:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Here's the battery.\n\n0:08:02\tSPEAKER_02\n When you push the button, it will be sent to the chip.\n\n0:08:08\tSPEAKER_02\n And the chip will send it to all kind of sub components.\n\n0:08:14\tSPEAKER_02\n That's what I said.\n\n0:08:16\tSPEAKER_02\n It's very difficult.\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_02\n And after that, it will be sent to the infrared.\n\n0:08:22\tSPEAKER_02\n And that will send it to your television.\n\n0:08:26\tSPEAKER_02\n That's a short how it works.\n\n0:08:28\tSPEAKER_02\n I think I can make it difficult.\n\n0:08:30\tSPEAKER_02\n We all don't get it.\n\n0:08:34\tSPEAKER_02\n My preference is it won't be...\n\n0:08:38\tSPEAKER_02\n We shouldn't make it too big.\n\n0:08:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Also for the cost.\n\n0:08:43\tSPEAKER_02\n We should only put one battery on it, along lasting battery.\n\n0:08:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Also for the cost.\n\n0:08:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Use only plastic.\n\n0:08:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Not other materials.\n\n0:08:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Also because of the cost.\n\n0:08:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Not too much buttons on it.\n\n0:08:58\tSPEAKER_02\n We can also make a button with a menu button.\n\n0:09:03\tSPEAKER_02\n And then that you will see it on a TV.\n\n0:09:08\tSPEAKER_02\n And on a TV you can switch into the menu.\n\n0:09:11\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's easier.\n\n0:09:14\tSPEAKER_02\n And the bleep signal.\n\n0:09:16\tSPEAKER_02\n You thought it was.\n\n0:09:18\tSPEAKER_02\n But we can also use it a bleep like something when the battery is empty.\n\n0:09:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Then there's a bleep.\n\n0:09:23\tSPEAKER_02\n You'll have to change it in a week or something.\n\n0:09:26\tSPEAKER_02\n And also the bleep.\n\n0:09:28\tSPEAKER_02\n What I told you about when you lost it and you push the button.\n\n0:09:32\tSPEAKER_02\n And then you will bleep bleep.\n\n0:09:34\tSPEAKER_02\n And we will find it.\n\n0:09:36\tSPEAKER_02\n This is just two questions.\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_03\n The battery.\n\n0:09:40\tSPEAKER_03\n You say one battery is cheaper.\n\n0:09:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Why?\n\n0:09:44\tSPEAKER_02\n If we use only one small pen light, then it will be cheaper than what you are doing.\n\n0:09:51\tSPEAKER_03\n When you use two, you can use it two times longer.\n\n0:09:55\tSPEAKER_02\n But then we will have to make the remote control long lasting.\n\n0:10:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Just the size of the remote control.\n\n0:10:07\tSPEAKER_03\n And the buttons.\n\n0:10:08\tSPEAKER_03\n When you use it on the television, you need the television.\n\n0:10:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Which can use it.\n\n0:10:17\tSPEAKER_02\n But I think this, our remote controllers for the tele-efficient, we sell in our company.\n\n0:10:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Or is it also for other televisions?\n\n0:10:31\tSPEAKER_03\n I think we have to use it also on other televisions.\n\n0:10:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Then this is an option.\n\n0:10:37\tSPEAKER_02\n So maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions.\n\n0:10:41\tSPEAKER_02\n And we make it easier for our televisions.\n\n0:10:45\tSPEAKER_02\n And on the other televisions, you can also use it.\n\n0:10:48\tSPEAKER_03\n But then the one choose.\n\n0:10:52\tSPEAKER_03\n I think that's two different things.\n\n0:10:55\tSPEAKER_03\n We have to choose one.\n\n0:10:57\tSPEAKER_02\n It has to work on all televisions.\n\n0:11:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Then I think the menu button will only work on the newer televisions.\n\n0:11:07\tSPEAKER_02\n And we will look forward and don't make a remote control.\n\n0:11:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Which is for all the televisions.\n\n0:11:16\tSPEAKER_02\n And I just have one more idea.\n\n0:11:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe it's one of your tasks.\n\n0:11:22\tSPEAKER_02\n But to have a trendy remote control, we can also make something like Nokia mobile phones to change covers.\n\n0:11:32\tSPEAKER_02\n So if you have a trendy house with all red yellow and something, then you can put a red cover on it.\n\n0:11:40\tSPEAKER_02\n And also different things.\n\n0:11:43\tSPEAKER_00\n We'll just add to the cost.\n\n0:11:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Then it won't be, we'll have just one cover on the original one.\n\n0:11:51\tSPEAKER_02\n And then you can buy the covers.\n\n0:11:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes. But you have to be able to change it.\n\n0:11:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Does it make it more difficult to design?\n\n0:12:00\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it will be a little more difficult, but not too much.\n\n0:12:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Just like with Nokia mobile phones.\n\n0:12:07\tSPEAKER_03\n You have to have a much more Nokia phone, then this one.\n\n0:12:12\tSPEAKER_02\n We'll have to put five covers on it and see if it works.\n\n0:12:17\tSPEAKER_02\n If it won't work, then we'll get something else.\n\n0:12:20\tSPEAKER_02\n And we won't go further with it.\n\n0:12:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Are there profits bigger than the cost?\n\n0:12:28\tSPEAKER_02\n A government in China, maybe I guess, so expensive, I think.\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_03\n But there are also design costs.\n\n0:12:38\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't think when you have remote control, do you change the coffee?\n\n0:12:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe I won't.\n\n0:12:47\tSPEAKER_02\n But maybe I think trendy people or children, when you can paint on it and the children think of it.\n\n0:12:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, this is my remote control.\n\n0:12:55\tSPEAKER_02\n I made a picture on it.\n\n0:12:57\tSPEAKER_03\n I think that two less people will change it for good profit.\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you think about it?\n\n0:13:08\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it will make profit enough.\n\n0:13:16\tSPEAKER_01\n It's an original idea.\n\n0:13:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, it is.\n\n0:13:20\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't think we have to do it.\n\n0:13:23\tSPEAKER_02\n You're the project manager.\n\n0:13:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, that's it.\n\n0:13:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Thank you.\n\n0:13:29\tSPEAKER_03\n So now the user interface design.\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, that's good.\n\n0:13:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Come on.\n\n0:13:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, well, I should give a short talk about the technical function design.\n\n0:14:06\tSPEAKER_01\n I thought the technical function design was for remote control to have some influence on the TV set.\n\n0:14:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Both audio and video in a cordless way, no cords attached.\n\n0:14:20\tSPEAKER_01\n And well, it all by pushing a button on the remote.\n\n0:14:26\tSPEAKER_01\n That was from my own experience and the previous meeting.\n\n0:14:31\tSPEAKER_01\n I find some interesting quotes on the web.\n\n0:14:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, the same idea here.\n\n0:14:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Message to the television.\n\n0:14:40\tSPEAKER_01\n And well, basic operations like on and off and switching channels.\n\n0:14:47\tSPEAKER_01\n And maybe a teletext or something like that.\n\n0:14:55\tSPEAKER_01\n All these are two remotes.\n\n0:14:59\tSPEAKER_01\n And that's our dilemma, I think.\n\n0:15:03\tSPEAKER_01\n We just heard from the industrial designer how difficult it is.\n\n0:15:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Shall we make a basic remote control with just swapping channels and volume and power button and will nothing much more or more functions on the remote.\n\n0:15:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe more devices you can influence radio or video recorder.\n\n0:15:28\tSPEAKER_01\n VCR.\n\n0:15:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, well, that's our dilemma. Any ideas about that?\n\n0:15:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Basic or multifunctional?\n\n0:15:40\tSPEAKER_01\n We were good back on that later.\n\n0:15:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, well, that was just on my mind.\n\n0:15:46\tSPEAKER_01\n So I didn't know what way we would go.\n\n0:15:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, well, that was my functional talk.\n\n0:15:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Thank you.\n\n0:16:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:16:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:16:38\tSPEAKER_00\n So I'm going to have a presentation about the market, about what people think.\n\n0:16:48\tSPEAKER_00\n We did usability lab test with 100 persons.\n\n0:16:53\tSPEAKER_00\n And we looked at several things among them design.\n\n0:17:01\tSPEAKER_00\n What for stations they had while using remote controls.\n\n0:17:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, what will be our market?\n\n0:17:09\tSPEAKER_00\n And we asked them if we had some new features.\n\n0:17:13\tSPEAKER_00\n If there will be a good idea or not.\n\n0:17:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, our findings are users. They dislike the look and feel of current remote controls.\n\n0:17:26\tSPEAKER_00\n They especially found them very ugly.\n\n0:17:30\tSPEAKER_00\n And they also found them hard to learn how to use it.\n\n0:17:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, they also set a lot.\n\n0:17:38\tSPEAKER_00\n So, sapping should be very easy.\n\n0:17:42\tSPEAKER_00\n And 50% of the users only use 10% of the buttons.\n\n0:17:48\tSPEAKER_00\n So a lot of unused bitness.\n\n0:17:51\tSPEAKER_00\n There is more findings on the bitness.\n\n0:17:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Which bitness find users very important and which not.\n\n0:17:59\tSPEAKER_00\n And how much do they use them?\n\n0:18:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, the most used bitness is the channels for action.\n\n0:18:06\tSPEAKER_00\n And we asked them how well event they think the bitness are.\n\n0:18:11\tSPEAKER_00\n The power volume and channels elections are very relevant.\n\n0:18:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Tailatex is less relevant but also important.\n\n0:18:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Not important. They found the audio.\n\n0:18:23\tSPEAKER_00\n And it's not the volume bit specific.\n\n0:18:26\tSPEAKER_00\n The pitch or the left or right.\n\n0:18:29\tSPEAKER_00\n The screen and the brightness and channel settings.\n\n0:18:33\tSPEAKER_00\n And they also are not used very often.\n\n0:18:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Then we have a few graphs about the market.\n\n0:18:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Here we can see what the market share is of several groups.\n\n0:18:49\tSPEAKER_00\n As you can see, most users are between 36 and 45.\n\n0:18:55\tSPEAKER_00\n The younger group between 6 and 25 is not very big.\n\n0:19:00\tSPEAKER_00\n And to come back on the swapping things.\n\n0:19:05\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't think the younger will be most interested in it.\n\n0:19:10\tSPEAKER_00\n But they are not a very big group.\n\n0:19:15\tSPEAKER_00\n And here we asked them how would you like a new feature?\n\n0:19:20\tSPEAKER_00\n If you have an LCD on the remote control.\n\n0:19:23\tSPEAKER_00\n What would you think of it?\n\n0:19:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Now you can clearly see young users say from a.\n\n0:19:28\tSPEAKER_00\n They will be very nice.\n\n0:19:30\tSPEAKER_00\n And all the users think they are a bit scared of change.\n\n0:19:34\tSPEAKER_00\n I think they won't like it.\n\n0:19:37\tSPEAKER_00\n And another thing.\n\n0:19:39\tSPEAKER_00\n How would you like to have speech recognition on it?\n\n0:19:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, you see the same young users.\n\n0:19:46\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that's an interesting idea.\n\n0:19:48\tSPEAKER_00\n And old users not.\n\n0:19:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, we found out that I are two several markers at which we can aim.\n\n0:19:57\tSPEAKER_00\n The first are the younger.\n\n0:19:59\tSPEAKER_00\n The age between 16 and 45.\n\n0:20:03\tSPEAKER_00\n They are highly interested in the features.\n\n0:20:06\tSPEAKER_00\n As you can see here.\n\n0:20:09\tSPEAKER_00\n And they are more critical on their money spending.\n\n0:20:15\tSPEAKER_00\n The second group is the older group.\n\n0:20:18\tSPEAKER_00\n The age between 46 and 65.\n\n0:20:21\tSPEAKER_00\n They are less interested in new features.\n\n0:20:24\tSPEAKER_00\n But they spend their money more easily.\n\n0:20:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Now, if you look back at this graph.\n\n0:20:30\tSPEAKER_00\n You can see that among the first group is about 60%.\n\n0:20:36\tSPEAKER_00\n And the second group about 40%.\n\n0:20:39\tSPEAKER_00\n So the first group is bigger.\n\n0:20:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, then I come to my personal preferences.\n\n0:20:48\tSPEAKER_00\n The first question is also we have to ask.\n\n0:20:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Is at which mark do we aim at?\n\n0:20:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Of course, saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that all people won't buy it.\n\n0:20:59\tSPEAKER_00\n But less of them will buy it.\n\n0:21:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, I...\n\n0:21:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:21:06\tSPEAKER_00\n But I fact, even young people say it's hard to use remote control.\n\n0:21:13\tSPEAKER_00\n So if you make a remote control, that is very easy to use.\n\n0:21:17\tSPEAKER_00\n That's especially aimed at this group.\n\n0:21:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Even the young group will also be more interested.\n\n0:21:23\tSPEAKER_00\n And we can make special features.\n\n0:21:26\tSPEAKER_00\n But I think it looks nice in the first time.\n\n0:21:30\tSPEAKER_00\n But when you use it, I don't know what's the good thing of speech recognition.\n\n0:21:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, that's my second point.\n\n0:21:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Less important functions should be discarded from the remote control.\n\n0:21:45\tSPEAKER_00\n It's about the kitchen we had earlier.\n\n0:21:50\tSPEAKER_00\n You can find most functions on a TV set.\n\n0:21:55\tSPEAKER_00\n So you don't have to have a lot of audio options or screen options to change the brightness.\n\n0:22:02\tSPEAKER_00\n That's these things.\n\n0:22:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, the design is very important.\n\n0:22:06\tSPEAKER_00\n One thing I didn't say I think is that a lot of users also said that I will buy a good lurking remote control if there will be one.\n\n0:22:17\tSPEAKER_00\n But they found most remote controls very ugly.\n\n0:22:21\tSPEAKER_00\n So the design of our remote control is very important.\n\n0:22:25\tSPEAKER_00\n And it should be very self-friendly as most users use it for that.\n\n0:22:32\tSPEAKER_00\n That way are my findings.\n\n0:22:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:22:36\tSPEAKER_02\n I have one question.\n\n0:22:37\tSPEAKER_02\n If we aim for the younger people, and there will be a lot of features like LCD or the speech recognizing, the cost will be a lot higher.\n\n0:22:52\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we don't have that in our budget.\n\n0:22:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you think?\n\n0:22:58\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't think 25 euros for a remote is really cheap or something.\n\n0:23:05\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's hard to get the younger.\n\n0:23:13\tSPEAKER_03\n I think LCD is cheaper than speech recognition.\n\n0:23:18\tSPEAKER_03\n I think that can be a good option.\n\n0:23:21\tSPEAKER_03\n LCD.\n\n0:23:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Just LCD.\n\n0:23:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:23:25\tNone\n Only the LCD.\n\n0:23:28\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:23:29\tSPEAKER_03\n But we'll come back on that.\n\n0:23:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:23:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Now.\n\n0:23:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Go.\n\n0:23:43\tSPEAKER_03\n What?\n\n0:23:50\tSPEAKER_03\n We'll go back on the decisions later.\n\n0:23:54\tSPEAKER_03\n No.\n\n0:23:55\tSPEAKER_03\n We have a few new product requirements.\n\n0:23:58\tSPEAKER_03\n First, teletext.\n\n0:24:00\tSPEAKER_03\n We have internet now, so we don't need the teletext anymore.\n\n0:24:04\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:24:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Not necessary.\n\n0:24:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Next.\n\n0:24:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Only for the television.\n\n0:24:14\tSPEAKER_03\n So we don't look at other things like the radio or something.\n\n0:24:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Only the television.\n\n0:24:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Third.\n\n0:24:24\tSPEAKER_03\n We look at the age group of 40 plus.\n\n0:24:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Now, younger than 40.\n\n0:24:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Big group and like you showed.\n\n0:24:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Not very much people by our stuff.\n\n0:24:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Fort point.\n\n0:24:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Our corporate color and slogan must be used.\n\n0:24:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Very important for the design.\n\n0:24:50\tSPEAKER_03\n So you can see it on our side.\n\n0:24:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Next.\n\n0:24:56\tSPEAKER_03\n We have to make our decisions what we want to do.\n\n0:25:09\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:25:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Like you said, we need the.\n\n0:25:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe it's good to put it in a document.\n\n0:25:28\tSPEAKER_03\n We have to decide what controls do we need.\n\n0:25:32\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:25:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe you can tell us.\n\n0:25:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe we can first have a discussion on the.\n\n0:25:39\tSPEAKER_00\n To provide requirements you just said.\n\n0:25:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Sorry.\n\n0:25:43\tSPEAKER_00\n The requirements you just said.\n\n0:25:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:25:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe you first have a discussion about that.\n\n0:25:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:25:49\tSPEAKER_00\n That person think tell the text is a good option.\n\n0:25:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Not everyone who's lucky to be can go to internet when they want to see the latest news.\n\n0:26:01\tSPEAKER_03\n But we don't do it.\n\n0:26:05\tSPEAKER_03\n You recrymines.\n\n0:26:08\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:26:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Not my recrymines.\n\n0:26:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, just have to do that.\n\n0:26:13\tSPEAKER_02\n We have to do this.\n\n0:26:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:26:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:26:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Unfortunately.\n\n0:26:19\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:26:21\tSPEAKER_03\n What controls do we need?\n\n0:26:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, power button.\n\n0:26:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:26:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Power.\n\n0:26:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I think separate channels.\n\n0:26:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Channel.\n\n0:26:52\tSPEAKER_01\n But then both the separate channels.\n\n0:26:55\tSPEAKER_01\n So.\n\n0:26:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Zero to nine or something.\n\n0:26:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Nine.\n\n0:27:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe it's easy to.\n\n0:27:14\tSPEAKER_03\n What was your one?\n\n0:27:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Techno line.\n\n0:27:18\tSPEAKER_00\n So the functional requirements.\n\n0:27:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:27:27\tSPEAKER_03\n We have.\n\n0:27:33\tSPEAKER_03\n No, no, no, no.\n\n0:27:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, is that example of the L-min?\n\n0:27:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:27:40\tSPEAKER_03\n That was the.\n\n0:27:42\tSPEAKER_03\n The.\n\n0:27:43\tSPEAKER_03\n The.\n\n0:27:44\tSPEAKER_03\n The.\n\n0:27:45\tSPEAKER_03\n The.\n\n0:27:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Hello.\n\n0:27:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:27:57\tSPEAKER_03\n What do we need?\n\n0:28:00\tSPEAKER_03\n On off.\n\n0:28:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Zero to nine.\n\n0:28:03\tSPEAKER_02\n To change to the next channel.\n\n0:28:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Just one button.\n\n0:28:06\tSPEAKER_02\n To move up, move down.\n\n0:28:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that's the.\n\n0:28:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Channel.\n\n0:28:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Do we make a menu?\n\n0:28:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Menu.\n\n0:28:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:28:16\tSPEAKER_03\n New.\n\n0:28:17\tSPEAKER_03\n New.\n\n0:28:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Teleficient.\n\n0:28:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Do have menus.\n\n0:28:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Menu.\n\n0:28:25\tSPEAKER_03\n I think.\n\n0:28:30\tSPEAKER_03\n The.\n\n0:28:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Only one or two.\n\n0:28:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Nomash.\n\n0:28:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:28:39\tSPEAKER_03\n And.\n\n0:28:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:44\tSPEAKER_03\n That's.\n\n0:28:47\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it will be quite easy to use with.\n\n0:28:59\tSPEAKER_00\n For arrows.\n\n0:29:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Up down for channel selection.\n\n0:29:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Left.\n\n0:29:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:29:05\tSPEAKER_00\n For volume.\n\n0:29:06\tSPEAKER_00\n And.\n\n0:29:07\tSPEAKER_00\n A menu.\n\n0:29:08\tSPEAKER_00\n A button.\n\n0:29:09\tSPEAKER_00\n And if you press the menu button, you get into the menu.\n\n0:29:12\tSPEAKER_00\n And you can use the same buttons.\n\n0:29:14\tSPEAKER_00\n You can use them to tend to scroll to the menu and change the options.\n\n0:29:18\tSPEAKER_03\n On the LCD screen.\n\n0:29:20\tSPEAKER_00\n You mean.\n\n0:29:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, yeah, that depends on if you have the menu on the TV.\n\n0:29:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Or you get the menu on the LCD screen on the remote control.\n\n0:29:29\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it's better to have it on the remote control.\n\n0:29:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Because it has to work on all televisions.\n\n0:29:37\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:29:38\tNone\n Yes.\n\n0:29:39\tSPEAKER_02\n And we're coming to the cast.\n\n0:29:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:29:44\tSPEAKER_03\n But if we.\n\n0:29:51\tSPEAKER_00\n But well, if we aim at the younger market.\n\n0:29:55\tSPEAKER_00\n As they as we seen in the usability lab.\n\n0:30:00\tSPEAKER_00\n They will buy a nice looking.\n\n0:30:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Remote control.\n\n0:30:07\tSPEAKER_00\n And also to find the easy to use.\n\n0:30:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Part very important.\n\n0:30:12\tSPEAKER_00\n So if you have LCD screen and not too many buttons.\n\n0:30:17\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that will increase.\n\n0:30:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Even when it's a bit more cost, it will still sell.\n\n0:30:25\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:30:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Now we don't have a lot of buttons.\n\n0:30:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Is this enough?\n\n0:30:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Mute.\n\n0:30:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Mute.\n\n0:30:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe in the menu.\n\n0:30:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but then it's always more than one.\n\n0:30:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Mute thing to do.\n\n0:30:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:30:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe more.\n\n0:31:04\tSPEAKER_03\n No.\n\n0:31:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Well.\n\n0:31:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Then that's all.\n\n0:31:14\tSPEAKER_03\n This will be the buttons.\n\n0:31:17\tSPEAKER_03\n And.\n\n0:31:24\tSPEAKER_03\n I think that's enough for the next phase.\n\n0:31:28\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:31:29\tSPEAKER_03\n You can go on to.\n\n0:31:33\tSPEAKER_02\n But now we have only the buttons.\n\n0:31:37\tSPEAKER_02\n And we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like.\n\n0:31:42\tSPEAKER_03\n No, that's for the next phase.\n\n0:31:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:31:48\tSPEAKER_03\n If it's a check.\n\n0:31:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Phase two is to conceptual design.\n\n0:31:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:31:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Then we will have to concepts.\n\n0:32:01\tSPEAKER_03\n That's for the next point.\n\n0:32:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Now we've launched break.\n\n0:32:10\tSPEAKER_03\n After that, we have 30 minutes for work.\n\n0:32:14\tSPEAKER_03\n And you can find the minutes in the project document for the inclusive.\n\n0:32:21\tSPEAKER_03\n The buttons.\n\n0:32:25\tSPEAKER_03\n You're in the video action.\n\n0:32:32\tSPEAKER_03\n You can find them in the email.\n\n0:32:35\tSPEAKER_03\n So not harmful.\n\n0:32:38\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:32:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Good.\n\n0:32:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Thank you.\n\n0:32:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Thank you.\n\n0:32:59\tNone\n So.\n\n0:33:26\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:33:29\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:33:32\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:33:35\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:36\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:33:37\tNone\n You have another.\n\n0:33:46\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:33:53\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:33:56\tNone\n You should.\n\n0:33:57\tNone\n You can start at the computer.\n\n0:34:00\tNone\n Shoot.\n\n0:34:29\tNone\n Shoot.\n\n0:34:36\tNone\n Shoot.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "SPEAKER and his colleagues have a meeting about the working of the remote
