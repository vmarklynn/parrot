We can do it on here.\n\n0:02:20\tSPEAKER_00\n All right.\n\n0:02:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's go forward then.\n\n0:02:22\tSPEAKER_00\n So we're all going to draw our favorite animal and then sum up our favorite characteristics of that animal.\n\n0:02:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Even if you're not a good driver like me.\n\n0:02:29\tSPEAKER_00\n All right.\n\n0:02:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Just excuse me.\n\n0:02:31\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:02:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's see.\n\n0:02:33\tNone\n I have things.\n\n0:02:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Let's see.\n\n0:03:01\tSPEAKER_02\n I draw like I'm in grade five.\n\n0:03:08\tSPEAKER_02\n So we'll do that.\n\n0:03:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:03:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, about one more minute.\n\n0:03:49\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:03:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:04:11\tSPEAKER_01\n I'd like to start off.\n\n0:04:15\tSPEAKER_01\n I'll go.\n\n0:04:16\tSPEAKER_01\n This is my picture.\n\n0:04:17\tSPEAKER_01\n I drew fish.\n\n0:04:18\tSPEAKER_01\n I like fish because, you know, they're a whole water vascular system thing.\n\n0:04:19\tSPEAKER_01\n It's pretty cool.\n\n0:04:20\tSPEAKER_01\n They've got a pretty good habitat and they're pretty sometimes, sometimes fishes, but that's okay.\n\n0:04:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, only if they're piranhas.\n\n0:04:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, they're easy, you know.\n\n0:04:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:04:32\tSPEAKER_00\n All right.\n\n0:04:33\tSPEAKER_00\n You want to go next?\n\n0:04:36\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll go.\n\n0:04:37\tSPEAKER_02\n I drew a kitty.\n\n0:04:38\tSPEAKER_02\n It's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat.\n\n0:04:42\tSPEAKER_01\n No, I love cats.\n\n0:04:43\tSPEAKER_02\n No, I don't know.\n\n0:04:44\tSPEAKER_02\n I love cats.\n\n0:04:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it does look like a cat.\n\n0:04:46\tSPEAKER_02\n I love cats because they're independent.\n\n0:04:49\tSPEAKER_02\n They pretty much know what they want.\n\n0:04:50\tSPEAKER_02\n They get it.\n\n0:04:51\tSPEAKER_02\n They move on.\n\n0:04:52\tNone\n I love cats too.\n\n0:04:53\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm a cat person.\n\n0:04:54\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm allergic to cats.\n\n0:04:57\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm allergic to cats too.\n\n0:04:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, okay.\n\n0:05:00\tSPEAKER_00\n If you're around when I had a roommate who was allergic, but if she was around my cat forever, she became used to it.\n\n0:05:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, you know, if you're around the full one, pretty tight.\n\n0:05:08\tSPEAKER_01\n I still can't sleep with them in my room.\n\n0:05:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:05:11\tSPEAKER_01\n This summer, I love cats.\n\n0:05:13\tSPEAKER_01\n It's crazy.\n\n0:05:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:05:16\tSPEAKER_03\n I drew a badger.\n\n0:05:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Cool.\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_00\n I drew a badger.\n\n0:05:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Good choice.\n\n0:05:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Why badger?\n\n0:05:23\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:05:24\tSPEAKER_03\n They're grumpy and mocked her and all.\n\n0:05:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Are you trying to suggest something?\n\n0:05:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, a little bit like the...\n\n0:05:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:32\tSPEAKER_03\n And then, she knew when to do a badger.\n\n0:05:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, okay.\n\n0:05:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:36\tSPEAKER_03\n And then, I don't know if she know Brian Jacques.\n\n0:05:38\tSPEAKER_03\n He's a little puddling rider.\n\n0:05:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:05:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Sounded us from, like, a red wall.\n\n0:05:43\tSPEAKER_03\n That kind of looks badger school and that one too.\n\n0:05:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:05:48\tSPEAKER_00\n And I'm last.\n\n0:05:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:05:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Look at my sad sad giraffe.\n\n0:05:51\tSPEAKER_00\n No, it's good.\n\n0:05:52\tSPEAKER_00\n No, no, no.\n\n0:05:53\tSPEAKER_00\n It ends up looking like some kind of dinosaur, but whatever.\n\n0:05:55\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know even much about giraffes, but I just love the way they look.\n\n0:06:00\tSPEAKER_00\n They're just such odd creatures, you know?\n\n0:06:02\tSPEAKER_00\n I like that they're so unique and individual.\n\n0:06:05\tSPEAKER_00\n I guess.\n\n0:06:06\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know much about their behavior or anything, though.\n\n0:06:08\tSPEAKER_00\n I want to see a couple of what they really have to.\n\n0:06:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:11\tSPEAKER_00\n You can like the way they look.\n\n0:06:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:06:13\tNone\n All right.\n\n0:06:14\tSPEAKER_00\n I guess we're getting straight back into business here.\n\n0:06:19\tSPEAKER_00\n The selling price for our remote is going to be 25 euro.\n\n0:06:25\tSPEAKER_00\n And our profit aim is 50 million euro.\n\n0:06:28\tSPEAKER_00\n We're going to make this an international product marketed in the states, in Europe, in Asia.\n\n0:06:35\tSPEAKER_00\n And our production costs to make that profit is going to be a max of 1250 euro per remote.\n\n0:06:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:06:49\tSPEAKER_00\n So we're going to talk for a little while.\n\n0:06:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Here are some topics that we might be able to discuss.\n\n0:06:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Our experiences with remote controls are first ideas about this new remote.\n\n0:07:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Anything that you can bring to the table for this project.\n\n0:07:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:07\tSPEAKER_00\n You want to start us off?\n\n0:07:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Anybody have anything to offer?\n\n0:07:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, we want to make a multifunctional remote, right?\n\n0:07:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:07:14\tSPEAKER_02\n One remote for everything.\n\n0:07:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:07:16\tSPEAKER_03\n We have what sounds system, TV, DVD, VHS.\n\n0:07:23\tSPEAKER_03\n I think they'll be facing VHS-T, though.\n\n0:07:27\tSPEAKER_03\n But it's still there, so it's pot.\n\n0:07:30\tSPEAKER_03\n We're going to do it.\n\n0:07:32\tSPEAKER_01\n It needs to be compatible because universal remote controls are never universal.\n\n0:07:37\tSPEAKER_01\n They're never universal.\n\n0:07:38\tSPEAKER_00\n That's right.\n\n0:07:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Especially if you buy a not big product DVD player, say, usually it doesn't work if it's not one of them.\n\n0:07:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, it's so obvious.\n\n0:07:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:50\tSPEAKER_02\n So we're going to have to figure out how to cover all the different variances in signals.\n\n0:07:55\tSPEAKER_01\n And we need an insanely good instruction booklet because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways.\n\n0:08:05\tSPEAKER_00\n OK. And another thing that I think is important is the design of the product, how it feels in your hand.\n\n0:08:12\tSPEAKER_00\n If it's just flat and kind of boring, those don't, nobody wants to buy those anymore.\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_00\n They want the ergonomic ones.\n\n0:08:19\tSPEAKER_00\n They want like the flashy ones.\n\n0:08:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:21\tSPEAKER_00\n So like this keeps on.\n\n0:08:22\tSPEAKER_00\n This is the biggest ones that look high tech, too.\n\n0:08:26\tSPEAKER_03\n But at the same time, I'm so lucky.\n\n0:08:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:08:29\tSPEAKER_02\n So that people with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand.\n\n0:08:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that?\n\n0:08:43\tSPEAKER_00\n There's fast ones.\n\n0:08:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:45\tSPEAKER_00\n That's true.\n\n0:08:46\tSPEAKER_02\n What kind of battery would we want to use?\n\n0:08:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Because battery changing is usually double A.\n\n0:08:53\tSPEAKER_02\n OK.\n\n0:08:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Do some of them use triple A's though?\n\n0:08:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah. Some use triple A's.\n\n0:08:59\tSPEAKER_01\n So double or triple?\n\n0:09:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:01\tSPEAKER_03\n I guess that is.\n\n0:09:03\tSPEAKER_03\n We need to do triple A.\n\n0:09:05\tSPEAKER_03\n We can, but most people usually have the only surround.\n\n0:09:08\tSPEAKER_00\n OK.\n\n0:09:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:10\tSPEAKER_00\n But that has to do with the size of it, too.\n\n0:09:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, as long as we know that issue is, if we wanted to be more thin, then we'd probably want to go with a triple A.\n\n0:09:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Could you go with a small lithium battery?\n\n0:09:21\tSPEAKER_00\n It's OK.\n\n0:09:22\tSPEAKER_00\n We don't have to decide about it now just as long as we remember battery type and size is important.\n\n0:09:26\tSPEAKER_00\n OK.\n\n0:09:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Anything else?\n\n0:09:34\tSPEAKER_00\n All right.\n\n0:09:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Move along.\n\n0:09:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh.\n\n0:09:37\tSPEAKER_00\n We're closing the meeting.\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Next meeting is going to start in 30 minutes.\n\n0:09:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Here's what we're going to do.\n\n0:09:44\tSPEAKER_00\n The ID, which is who?\n\n0:09:46\tSPEAKER_00\n OK.\n\n0:09:48\tSPEAKER_00\n You're going to think about the working design.\n\n0:09:51\tSPEAKER_00\n What do you think of it?\n\n0:09:53\tSPEAKER_00\n OK.\n\n0:09:56\tSPEAKER_00\n And you ID.\n\n0:09:59\tSPEAKER_00\n The technical functions design, making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do, the functionality of it, operating all those different things.\n\n0:10:09\tSPEAKER_00\n OK.\n\n0:10:10\tSPEAKER_00\n And the marketing person, Courtney, is going to do the user requirements specification.\n\n0:10:17\tSPEAKER_00\n I guess that means specifying what exactly the user is going to be looking for.\n\n0:10:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Right?\n\n0:10:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:10:28\tSPEAKER_00\n I would think so.\n\n0:10:29\tSPEAKER_00\n OK.\n\n0:10:30\tSPEAKER_00\n And you're going to get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while.\n\n0:10:33\tSPEAKER_00\n OK.\n\n0:10:34\tSPEAKER_00\n So does anybody have anything they want to say before closing the meeting?\n\n0:10:38\tSPEAKER_00\n OK.\n\n0:10:39\tSPEAKER_00\n This meeting is officially over.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "Today is the kickoff meeting for the new product that the project manager Mandy is going to be designing.
