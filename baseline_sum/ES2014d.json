Already exists, do you want to place it, is it?\n\n0:00:12\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:00:18\tSPEAKER_01\n I said try to transfer it to my documents, but...\n\n0:00:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, you have to close that window, because that's the save one, is it?\n\n0:00:25\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm going to find it.\n\n0:00:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, that's spreadsheet.\n\n0:00:34\tNone\n Yeah, but I'll just redo it.\n\n0:00:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but I'll just redo it.\n\n0:00:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Right, I'll just redo it.\n\n0:00:55\tNone\n That's that centre.\n\n0:01:02\tSPEAKER_04\n That's a sunny season.\n\n0:01:10\tSPEAKER_00\n We are going to put the tie bed in.\n\n0:01:19\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm going to put it in for that.\n\n0:01:21\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll pass it around.\n\n0:01:23\tSPEAKER_00\n It looks like the curve on the sides.\n\n0:01:26\tSPEAKER_00\n It's almost curved, like, up to the main disc as well.\n\n0:01:31\tSPEAKER_00\n And the little line at the bottom indicate the paddle let you pull down and the extra brush.\n\n0:01:36\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm going to pull this up below that paddle.\n\n0:01:39\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm going to put the stick on the bottom with the company logo on.\n\n0:01:44\tSPEAKER_02\n You also have an Apple slash chain designed at the top.\n\n0:01:48\tSPEAKER_03\n It's half like that.\n\n0:01:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Sure it is.\n\n0:01:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, sure you'll feel it.\n\n0:01:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it's a bit more fun.\n\n0:01:53\tSPEAKER_00\n It's kind of not really a defender.\n\n0:01:55\tSPEAKER_00\n You think Apple is going to come up here and have a couple of ideas.\n\n0:01:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, we might get a couple ideas.\n\n0:02:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Of course this is fun.\n\n0:02:01\tSPEAKER_00\n It's fun.\n\n0:02:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Of course.\n\n0:02:03\tSPEAKER_00\n I like the meat.\n\n0:02:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, it's the end.\n\n0:02:06\tSPEAKER_00\n It probably has to be made of meat.\n\n0:02:09\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:02:10\tSPEAKER_00\n We didn't have anything small in the track.\n\n0:02:12\tSPEAKER_02\n For the prototype, well, it was hard to get.\n\n0:02:14\tSPEAKER_02\n The actual age of one bit.\n\n0:02:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Or would you have a button?\n\n0:02:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:02:18\tSPEAKER_00\n I would just choose simple shapes for all of them.\n\n0:02:21\tSPEAKER_00\n The important ones on volume ones will move them a bit bigger.\n\n0:02:25\tSPEAKER_00\n The meat could possibly be bigger.\n\n0:02:27\tSPEAKER_02\n You separate off from color.\n\n0:02:29\tSPEAKER_02\n The volume relates to buttons from the channel later buttons.\n\n0:02:33\tSPEAKER_02\n So you've got the volume and the volume of the sound.\n\n0:02:36\tSPEAKER_02\n And the channel on the meat.\n\n0:02:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:02:40\tSPEAKER_01\n All these things have cost implications.\n\n0:02:44\tSPEAKER_01\n And so when I've done my thing on cost, I had assumed that the only button that would be a different color would be the the red apple button.\n\n0:02:59\tSPEAKER_01\n So however, I've never lost the figure set to draw that.\n\n0:03:04\tSPEAKER_01\n But yeah, so there would be a cost implication on that.\n\n0:03:09\tSPEAKER_01\n And I suppose that's where the one I wanted to put in all these colors would be open to debate.\n\n0:03:17\tSPEAKER_01\n I suppose.\n\n0:03:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, colors wouldn't be too important.\n\n0:03:21\tSPEAKER_00\n But we didn't have any life-pages.\n\n0:03:24\tSPEAKER_01\n An important consideration.\n\n0:03:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:03:30\tSPEAKER_01\n And the second one underneath would be the idea for the...\n\n0:03:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:03:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:03:38\tSPEAKER_01\n So we've got detailed design meeting.\n\n0:03:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:03:47\tSPEAKER_01\n So we've got prototype presentation, which we've just done.\n\n0:03:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Evaluation criteria.\n\n0:03:57\tSPEAKER_01\n And the finance.\n\n0:04:00\tSPEAKER_01\n So I guess we have to evaluate if that meets the various aspects that we're looking for from our previous meeting.\n\n0:04:12\tSPEAKER_01\n So other than the fact that it doesn't have the same layer.\n\n0:04:16\tSPEAKER_01\n But obviously, obviously it would.\n\n0:04:21\tSPEAKER_01\n But other than that, we've got the red apple, we've got the buttons.\n\n0:04:24\tSPEAKER_01\n The only thing that's really changed is the coloration of the buttons.\n\n0:04:31\tSPEAKER_01\n And.\n\n0:04:34\tSPEAKER_01\n But after the evaluation criteria is the finance.\n\n0:04:39\tSPEAKER_01\n And.\n\n0:04:41\tSPEAKER_01\n And the cost of location only snow about this is that.\n\n0:04:47\tSPEAKER_01\n And because there's probably kind of important.\n\n0:04:51\tSPEAKER_01\n So, and then the production of evaluation has to...\n\n0:04:56\tSPEAKER_01\n How easy that would be to manufacture.\n\n0:05:01\tSPEAKER_01\n And whether it would.\n\n0:05:05\tSPEAKER_03\n So if you had to do a presentation, or we just.\n\n0:05:10\tSPEAKER_02\n That's the presentation.\n\n0:05:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Right. So as far as the finance of it, we're going to make sure that the cost.\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_01\n The production cost.\n\n0:05:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Because remember that was one of the first incinerations was to be under.\n\n0:05:25\tSPEAKER_01\n 1250 or two and a half.\n\n0:05:28\tSPEAKER_01\n 12 and a half euros.\n\n0:05:33\tSPEAKER_01\n So there's no redesign.\n\n0:05:36\tSPEAKER_01\n So that should.\n\n0:05:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:05:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Seems to me that the thing that I have to do is.\n\n0:05:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Is what we find that.\n\n0:05:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Could we get us on the board just so we can.\n\n0:06:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Or do you have a bigger.\n\n0:06:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:06:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:06:10\tSPEAKER_03\n We've got a lot of the production costs.\n\n0:06:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:06:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:06:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:06:21\tSPEAKER_01\n So by the fact that we've got.\n\n0:06:26\tSPEAKER_01\n The simple chip and the kinetic energy source.\n\n0:06:30\tSPEAKER_01\n We've got a single curved.\n\n0:06:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Case.\n\n0:06:38\tSPEAKER_01\n We've got a rubber.\n\n0:06:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Case materials supplements.\n\n0:06:45\tSPEAKER_01\n So we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and.\n\n0:06:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:07:00\tSPEAKER_01\n The button supplements well originally I thought there would just be.\n\n0:07:05\tSPEAKER_01\n One in there because it was the one red.\n\n0:07:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Apple.\n\n0:07:11\tSPEAKER_01\n But so the so the real.\n\n0:07:14\tSPEAKER_01\n The real question then we come in.\n\n0:07:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Do you make all the buttons.\n\n0:07:20\tSPEAKER_03\n We do it on the post types.\n\n0:07:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Well.\n\n0:07:25\tSPEAKER_01\n So we've got one special button form which was the apple.\n\n0:07:28\tSPEAKER_01\n And the other thing else is going to be a standard.\n\n0:07:31\tSPEAKER_01\n We've got special material rubber wood titanium etc.\n\n0:07:35\tSPEAKER_01\n So I was originally thinking what rubber wasn't special but.\n\n0:07:39\tSPEAKER_01\n According to this maybe it is.\n\n0:07:42\tSPEAKER_01\n So.\n\n0:07:44\tSPEAKER_01\n And I mean effectively we've got 16 buttons that we're going to have on there.\n\n0:07:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:51\tSPEAKER_03\n I think you just do.\n\n0:07:53\tSPEAKER_01\n What.\n\n0:07:54\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:07:56\tSPEAKER_01\n So the answer is that meant to be all 16 buttons and therefore.\n\n0:08:01\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean what's the option was maybe not to have rubber buttons.\n\n0:08:06\tSPEAKER_01\n But just to have the one that was soft and spongy and therefore.\n\n0:08:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Whereas it would be the special color would be for the.\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_01\n So you would only have the one special button that was rubber.\n\n0:08:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Whereas the rest would be hard plastic.\n\n0:08:25\tSPEAKER_03\n I think the button is just a supplement for all the buttons.\n\n0:08:28\tSPEAKER_03\n It's been made in a different material.\n\n0:08:31\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:08:35\tSPEAKER_01\n I would do it.\n\n0:08:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Every design change is.\n\n0:08:44\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:08:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:08:49\tSPEAKER_01\n If we just had all the buttons as standard.\n\n0:08:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Except for the one red apple then that would take care of that.\n\n0:08:55\tSPEAKER_01\n I guess.\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_01\n We'd have one special color and one special button for.\n\n0:09:02\tSPEAKER_01\n And when.\n\n0:09:04\tSPEAKER_01\n I plugged that in last time.\n\n0:09:06\tSPEAKER_01\n You know, remember it has to be under 12 and a half.\n\n0:09:10\tSPEAKER_01\n As far as I know that.\n\n0:09:14\tSPEAKER_01\n That took care of the.\n\n0:09:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Of the various supplements.\n\n0:09:21\tSPEAKER_01\n And if.\n\n0:09:24\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm.\n\n0:09:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Just.\n\n0:09:30\tSPEAKER_00\n It's on the.\n\n0:09:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe.\n\n0:09:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Now, right.\n\n0:09:47\tSPEAKER_01\n So, but the point would be that if we.\n\n0:09:52\tSPEAKER_01\n If we just did special, sorry, you were saying that.\n\n0:09:55\tSPEAKER_01\n It would be that one that you would put in one there.\n\n0:10:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:10:04\tSPEAKER_02\n So it was.\n\n0:10:07\tSPEAKER_01\n No, it's 9.7.\n\n0:10:08\tSPEAKER_01\n I've got.\n\n0:10:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:10:12\tSPEAKER_01\n So that would.\n\n0:10:16\tSPEAKER_01\n That would work out fine.\n\n0:10:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Assuming your correction or.\n\n0:10:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Assuming that one change covers all the buttons and that would be fine.\n\n0:10:29\tSPEAKER_01\n And there's nothing else as far as I can see that we plan to.\n\n0:10:34\tSPEAKER_02\n I know.\n\n0:10:36\tSPEAKER_02\n On the electronics, we've got the sample sensor.\n\n0:10:39\tSPEAKER_02\n The most simple chip.\n\n0:10:41\tSPEAKER_02\n And the sample sensor, the sample speed would be the voice recognition.\n\n0:10:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, which puts it before which we slightly have a budget, but together, something else.\n\n0:10:52\tSPEAKER_02\n And you know, be going on the special one back.\n\n0:10:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, if we.\n\n0:11:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, that gives us 12.7.\n\n0:11:04\tSPEAKER_02\n So maybe we could go.\n\n0:11:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe like the maybe one of the special colors.\n\n0:11:09\tSPEAKER_02\n But remember that the idea was to keep it the color of the.\n\n0:11:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, I see.\n\n0:11:15\tSPEAKER_01\n So just take out the special color for the apple.\n\n0:11:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Why don't you have to keep the simple chip.\n\n0:11:23\tSPEAKER_00\n There's a.\n\n0:11:24\tSPEAKER_00\n You know how you turn that one.\n\n0:11:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, possibly.\n\n0:11:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe we'll be giving it.\n\n0:11:34\tSPEAKER_02\n And go for battery instead.\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_01\n That would give you one less.\n\n0:11:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:40\tSPEAKER_02\n I was saying this one.\n\n0:11:41\tSPEAKER_01\n But you reckon that I mean, the thing is that you wanted to appeal to people and.\n\n0:11:47\tSPEAKER_01\n No, I have to replace batteries.\n\n0:11:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:51\tSPEAKER_02\n This is the whole technology type thing.\n\n0:11:55\tSPEAKER_02\n You're saying in the market, there's people like, kind of interesting gadgets.\n\n0:11:59\tSPEAKER_02\n And whether they figure the.\n\n0:12:02\tSPEAKER_02\n The sample sensor, the sample speed.\n\n0:12:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Or the technician is over where I think.\n\n0:12:08\tSPEAKER_02\n And it's not the batches or whatever they would.\n\n0:12:11\tSPEAKER_02\n You know what I mean?\n\n0:12:12\tSPEAKER_02\n The problem was the batches.\n\n0:12:14\tSPEAKER_02\n And the other thing there.\n\n0:12:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:17\tSPEAKER_02\n These are the most you know, the size which is there is more.\n\n0:12:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Which do you think or which do we think.\n\n0:12:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Is the more important of the options in a sense of the moment.\n\n0:12:27\tSPEAKER_01\n We've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point to.\n\n0:12:31\tSPEAKER_01\n At least remember that was a minimum requirement.\n\n0:12:34\tSPEAKER_01\n If we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful.\n\n0:12:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Would be to make it an originally we're going to make a simple.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Product.\n\n0:12:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Show you evaluate the prototype as we've got it now.\n\n0:12:48\tSPEAKER_03\n First.\n\n0:12:49\tSPEAKER_03\n And then to make decisions about what needs to be changed.\n\n0:12:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Makes sense.\n\n0:12:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:12:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Have a little thing.\n\n0:12:58\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:12:59\tSPEAKER_03\n We'll go and know it's 13.7 is with everything we want on.\n\n0:13:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Sorry.\n\n0:13:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Do you want back up just for the presentation?\n\n0:13:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:13:17\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't think the voice spectrum issue can be really more impressive.\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having device recognition was so that you could find the remote if it got lost.\n\n0:13:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:13:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:13:38\tSPEAKER_03\n This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the prototype we've got here.\n\n0:13:43\tSPEAKER_03\n And so the method is that design team makes a prototype and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we formulated.\n\n0:13:51\tSPEAKER_03\n And those ones are going to be in response to sort of market research.\n\n0:13:55\tSPEAKER_03\n And also finance, I guess.\n\n0:13:59\tSPEAKER_03\n And did on a scale from the true being one.\n\n0:14:02\tSPEAKER_03\n A false being 7.\n\n0:14:04\tSPEAKER_03\n So it's now the true no false.\n\n0:14:06\tSPEAKER_03\n And that's for.\n\n0:14:15\tSPEAKER_03\n So I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well.\n\n0:14:22\tSPEAKER_03\n At the end.\n\n0:14:24\tSPEAKER_03\n So we have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy.\n\n0:14:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Whether the product demonstrates technical innovation.\n\n0:14:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Whether it's easy to use.\n\n0:14:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Whether it's in cooperating sort of the fashion elements to try to fire.\n\n0:14:42\tSPEAKER_03\n And whether it's a recognizable real reaction product.\n\n0:14:46\tSPEAKER_03\n And I have to go onto the whiteboard and do this.\n\n0:14:49\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:14:51\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll go up here.\n\n0:15:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:15:03\tSPEAKER_03\n So the first one is.\n\n0:15:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Does the product look and feel fancy?\n\n0:15:09\tSPEAKER_03\n So if you do a sort of one.\n\n0:15:16\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:15:18\tSPEAKER_02\n And we have a single care for which we was kind of maybe like the feel the product is like.\n\n0:15:25\tSPEAKER_02\n So.\n\n0:15:27\tSPEAKER_02\n And we have the rubber kind of spongy feel.\n\n0:15:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:31\tSPEAKER_02\n In every time.\n\n0:15:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:33\tSPEAKER_02\n So.\n\n0:15:34\tSPEAKER_00\n So.\n\n0:15:42\tSPEAKER_03\n I think what is one false or is one true or false?\n\n0:15:45\tSPEAKER_03\n One true and okay.\n\n0:15:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Seven false.\n\n0:15:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:15:50\tSPEAKER_03\n So maybe.\n\n0:15:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Because we haven't got the double care.\n\n0:15:56\tSPEAKER_00\n So.\n\n0:15:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Go for one.\n\n0:15:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:16:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:16:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:16:07\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:16:09\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:16:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Falsies.\n\n0:16:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Seven.\n\n0:16:12\tSPEAKER_03\n True is more.\n\n0:16:17\tSPEAKER_03\n So say about two.\n\n0:16:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Fancy.\n\n0:16:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:16:22\tSPEAKER_01\n We're not.\n\n0:16:23\tSPEAKER_03\n No.\n\n0:16:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe.\n\n0:16:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe.\n\n0:16:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Three.\n\n0:16:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, it's just that they're saying something remember that when you look down, we've got solder pearl.\n\n0:16:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Really, so the things you could have.\n\n0:16:35\tSPEAKER_01\n And we're not going for these.\n\n0:16:37\tSPEAKER_03\n This is just like the look.\n\n0:16:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Does it look fancy rather than functional?\n\n0:16:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:45\tSPEAKER_00\n So.\n\n0:16:46\tSPEAKER_00\n So.\n\n0:16:47\tSPEAKER_03\n So we go through two on that.\n\n0:16:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:16:52\tSPEAKER_03\n And.\n\n0:16:57\tSPEAKER_02\n How much does the product demonstrate technical innovation?\n\n0:16:59\tSPEAKER_02\n We're deciding between the kinetic power or.\n\n0:17:04\tSPEAKER_02\n The speech recognition.\n\n0:17:05\tSPEAKER_02\n We had either of those prior budget.\n\n0:17:08\tSPEAKER_02\n The motion.\n\n0:17:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:17:13\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:17:14\tSPEAKER_03\n What about the prototype as it is.\n\n0:17:16\tSPEAKER_03\n We've got.\n\n0:17:17\tSPEAKER_02\n We've got the speech recognition on it.\n\n0:17:19\tSPEAKER_03\n We're not the kinetic.\n\n0:17:21\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:17:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Because you can't afford that.\n\n0:17:23\tSPEAKER_01\n We took that out.\n\n0:17:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:25\tSPEAKER_02\n It's powerful.\n\n0:17:26\tSPEAKER_03\n All right.\n\n0:17:27\tSPEAKER_04\n It doesn't.\n\n0:17:28\tSPEAKER_04\n So it doesn't.\n\n0:17:29\tSPEAKER_03\n It's pretty.\n\n0:17:30\tSPEAKER_03\n The prototype as it is isn't sort of fulfilling the.\n\n0:17:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe.\n\n0:17:38\tSPEAKER_02\n It's got something.\n\n0:17:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:17:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, in 13.7, we do have kinetic.\n\n0:17:44\tSPEAKER_01\n The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to 12.5.\n\n0:17:50\tSPEAKER_01\n And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic.\n\n0:17:53\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's very much dependent on what you do with your options.\n\n0:18:00\tSPEAKER_01\n And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker, then because the other functions we've got in are more.\n\n0:18:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Special material, the rubber wood titanium, etc.\n\n0:18:18\tSPEAKER_01\n If you go for that, that's at the high end because that's 0.6.\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Whereas down it, just special color is 0.2.\n\n0:18:25\tSPEAKER_01\n And you're trying to lose 1.2.\n\n0:18:28\tSPEAKER_01\n So it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensor speaker, you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else.\n\n0:18:40\tSPEAKER_01\n And the simple way to do it would be to have a battery.\n\n0:18:44\tSPEAKER_01\n And have your sample sensor speaker.\n\n0:18:48\tSPEAKER_01\n And then you're looking to take out 0.2, which would be coming from the button supplements category.\n\n0:18:57\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm just going to check exactly what it said in the email for.\n\n0:19:04\tSPEAKER_00\n How much of a difference would it make if you were the KFC pastor?\n\n0:19:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Because we did say that would be one of the fashion things.\n\n0:19:14\tSPEAKER_00\n But there's a lot of that.\n\n0:19:17\tSPEAKER_01\n And interface type.\n\n0:19:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, plastic rather than rubber.\n\n0:19:24\tSPEAKER_01\n That would make the cinema difference.\n\n0:19:27\tSPEAKER_01\n You could either, if you have a plastic rather than rubber, then that would enable you to get.\n\n0:19:35\tSPEAKER_01\n You could keep kinetic then you could keep your sample sensor and you were looking to take out 0.2.\n\n0:19:42\tSPEAKER_01\n So you could fiddle that down your special form at the bottom or your special color at the bottom.\n\n0:19:48\tSPEAKER_01\n And that would enable you to do it.\n\n0:19:51\tSPEAKER_02\n So, so we make it slightly more fancy than we use poison innovation.\n\n0:19:56\tSPEAKER_02\n We make it more innovative than we do.\n\n0:19:59\tSPEAKER_03\n But I just read the email again and it sort of says evaluate the design sort of as it is, I think.\n\n0:20:06\tSPEAKER_03\n So I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design.\n\n0:20:12\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know whether we've done it in the wrong order or something.\n\n0:20:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, okay.\n\n0:20:17\tSPEAKER_00\n I must pause a tour back as it is indeed.\n\n0:20:20\tSPEAKER_01\n It's rubber as it is, yes.\n\n0:20:22\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, this needs to go up a bit of something because we've got both the, both the, we've got, we've got 13.7 and we've got it at the moment.\n\n0:20:35\tSPEAKER_01\n And basically we're going to reduce down from that.\n\n0:20:38\tSPEAKER_01\n But the current one you'd see would be fancy would be two.\n\n0:20:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I've worked for innovation.\n\n0:20:45\tSPEAKER_01\n So we've got the speech thing and I would have said about a two as well.\n\n0:20:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:20:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Now the next one is, I'll have to go in by a couple of minutes.\n\n0:21:01\tSPEAKER_01\n The next one, well I can just sing about easy to use.\n\n0:21:05\tSPEAKER_01\n I would have said yes, I would have gone for a one on that.\n\n0:21:08\tSPEAKER_01\n There's point in thing.\n\n0:21:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:21:12\tSPEAKER_01\n And incorporate elements of fashion to attract buyer.\n\n0:21:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, it certainly has some.\n\n0:21:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Yep.\n\n0:21:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Say about a three maybe.\n\n0:21:30\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:21:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:42\tSPEAKER_01\n The product is a recognizable real reaction product.\n\n0:21:49\tSPEAKER_02\n This is the sense of using all of this.\n\n0:21:51\tSPEAKER_02\n All of this product.\n\n0:21:52\tSPEAKER_02\n All of this.\n\n0:21:53\tSPEAKER_02\n But it's got a very big label on the bottom saying.\n\n0:21:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:59\tSPEAKER_03\n So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleep technology.\n\n0:22:04\tSPEAKER_03\n And sort of thing as well as having the logo on and all that sort of.\n\n0:22:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Is it sort of a recognizable product because it's fitting with our other products which are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft.\n\n0:22:21\tSPEAKER_00\n That's what I'm saying.\n\n0:22:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Switch.\n\n0:22:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Switch.\n\n0:22:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Switch.\n\n0:22:26\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a kind of sponge and logoiness.\n\n0:22:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe the more kind of comfortable.\n\n0:22:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:34\tSPEAKER_02\n And just what you like.\n\n0:22:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:22:37\tSPEAKER_02\n So we're going for a two.\n\n0:22:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Three.\n\n0:22:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, the logo would be more recognizable on the actual thing.\n\n0:22:47\tSPEAKER_00\n It's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that.\n\n0:22:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Sure.\n\n0:22:50\tSPEAKER_00\n But yeah.\n\n0:22:52\tSPEAKER_00\n I think the logo would definitely be very recognizable.\n\n0:22:55\tSPEAKER_00\n And it does have actually set a lot of that.\n\n0:22:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:22:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:23:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Two.\n\n0:23:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:23:02\tSPEAKER_04\n That's how to say it.\n\n0:23:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:23:05\tSPEAKER_01\n So.\n\n0:23:06\tSPEAKER_01\n So we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements.\n\n0:23:13\tSPEAKER_01\n And then.\n\n0:23:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:15\tSPEAKER_01\n What is for all of the business?\n\n0:23:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Do I add them up and make ourselves anything?\n\n0:23:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, we said, yeah, I think we sort of.\n\n0:23:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Add them up.\n\n0:23:21\tSPEAKER_00\n So sort of an average is going to be.\n\n0:23:23\tSPEAKER_03\n About two.\n\n0:23:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Two.\n\n0:23:29\tSPEAKER_03\n One point eight is something.\n\n0:23:31\tSPEAKER_03\n I think anyway.\n\n0:23:32\tSPEAKER_03\n So yeah, pretty close to two.\n\n0:23:35\tSPEAKER_03\n So I mean, it's pretty good at the moment, but it's going to get worse, isn't it?\n\n0:23:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Yep.\n\n0:23:40\tSPEAKER_03\n I make sure it doesn't get too much.\n\n0:23:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Too much too much too much.\n\n0:23:46\tSPEAKER_02\n It was a 13 point sample.\n\n0:23:48\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a set of the price.\n\n0:23:49\tSPEAKER_02\n All of the features.\n\n0:23:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:23:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:23:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, you can lose one point two and still meet two requirements.\n\n0:24:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:24:02\tSPEAKER_01\n I put it back on.\n\n0:24:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:24:05\tSPEAKER_02\n It's the last stage, which was so that the finance.\n\n0:24:08\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm not sure.\n\n0:24:10\tSPEAKER_00\n So we'll probably have to leave it.\n\n0:24:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:14\tSPEAKER_02\n So we're going to thought so.\n\n0:24:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe just.\n\n0:24:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:24:18\tSPEAKER_01\n So what was it control?\n\n0:24:21\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it was.\n\n0:24:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, okay.\n\n0:24:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:24:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:24:27\tSPEAKER_01\n So you can see there that the.\n\n0:24:30\tSPEAKER_01\n If you want to keep kinetic, right?\n\n0:24:32\tSPEAKER_01\n You've got a choice there.\n\n0:24:33\tSPEAKER_01\n We're going down to battery, which would save you one.\n\n0:24:37\tSPEAKER_01\n You've got.\n\n0:24:39\tSPEAKER_01\n The sample sensor and sample speaker, which is your big item.\n\n0:24:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Why should we just have a plastic case that we lose to?\n\n0:24:50\tSPEAKER_02\n That's right.\n\n0:24:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Which gets us.\n\n0:24:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Which gets you.\n\n0:24:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Like within the budget range.\n\n0:24:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:24:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Then we can make sure we definitely had all the platforms.\n\n0:25:06\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:25:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Different colors.\n\n0:25:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:10\tSPEAKER_03\n I was thinking that because maybe.\n\n0:25:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe the sort of rubber cases a bit less.\n\n0:25:14\tSPEAKER_03\n In sort of the corporate identity.\n\n0:25:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Then there's sort of a sleek plastic case.\n\n0:25:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:20\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:25:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Now we're last time all the time combinations.\n\n0:25:24\tSPEAKER_02\n We've released a little bit on.\n\n0:25:27\tSPEAKER_01\n So we're going for plastic, yes.\n\n0:25:29\tSPEAKER_03\n We've released a little bit on the fashion.\n\n0:25:31\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:32\tSPEAKER_02\n And now we know.\n\n0:25:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:35\tSPEAKER_02\n That's within the budget.\n\n0:25:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Do we actually have.\n\n0:25:39\tSPEAKER_02\n We just have one special.\n\n0:25:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Only these special forms down here.\n\n0:25:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, there was debate as to how you would count them.\n\n0:25:47\tSPEAKER_01\n You got special color.\n\n0:25:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, originally I was assuming we had the red apple.\n\n0:25:52\tSPEAKER_01\n And therefore that was the special color.\n\n0:25:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:55\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we should just imagine white buttons.\n\n0:25:57\tSPEAKER_02\n We've got all of them.\n\n0:25:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:59\tSPEAKER_02\n We've got 0.8 left.\n\n0:26:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we've got special form.\n\n0:26:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Now that would be one button.\n\n0:26:03\tSPEAKER_01\n And the question was, was that all buttons?\n\n0:26:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Or is that just one button?\n\n0:26:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Because our plan really wants to have one button only with the special.\n\n0:26:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:11\tSPEAKER_01\n So no matter how you look at that, that would be the same.\n\n0:26:14\tSPEAKER_01\n The other thing would then be special material rubber wood titanium.\n\n0:26:17\tSPEAKER_02\n I think maybe the special color we've got three now.\n\n0:26:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Just because of the volume buttons there.\n\n0:26:22\tSPEAKER_02\n And I guess we'd have one to show up with at the moment.\n\n0:26:24\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:26:25\tSPEAKER_02\n So the special color you want three in there.\n\n0:26:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Which I think we should.\n\n0:26:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:30\tSPEAKER_03\n You just need two special colors.\n\n0:26:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Because it's just two supplements.\n\n0:26:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:35\tSPEAKER_03\n One original color.\n\n0:26:36\tSPEAKER_03\n And then two supplements.\n\n0:26:38\tSPEAKER_03\n I think maybe.\n\n0:26:39\tSPEAKER_01\n That makes sense.\n\n0:26:40\tSPEAKER_03\n So we only need two for that.\n\n0:26:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:26:44\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, these are molded.\n\n0:26:46\tSPEAKER_03\n The one color is going to mold it out of a piece of paper.\n\n0:26:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:26:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I'd agree with that.\n\n0:26:51\tSPEAKER_01\n I think.\n\n0:26:52\tSPEAKER_01\n So special colors to.\n\n0:26:54\tSPEAKER_01\n We've got special form.\n\n0:26:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Is the one apple the rest are all standard.\n\n0:27:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Although you could argue that should maybe.\n\n0:27:03\tSPEAKER_01\n You were making these buttons down the bottom.\n\n0:27:05\tSPEAKER_01\n I was presuming bigger than the other ones.\n\n0:27:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Or were you was at the idea.\n\n0:27:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe that be a second.\n\n0:27:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:14\tSPEAKER_01\n I would have thought that's probably about.\n\n0:27:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Wow.\n\n0:27:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:27:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:27:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:37\tSPEAKER_02\n That makes sense.\n\n0:27:39\tSPEAKER_02\n So we've lost a little bit on the fashion.\n\n0:27:42\tSPEAKER_02\n We've lost a little bit on the fancy kind of.\n\n0:27:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:45\tSPEAKER_02\n The gems being kept.\n\n0:27:47\tSPEAKER_01\n The other lights please.\n\n0:27:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Our assets.\n\n0:27:49\tSPEAKER_01\n So you maybe put fashion.\n\n0:27:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Fashioned three rather than.\n\n0:27:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Should we do it?\n\n0:27:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, it definitely fits the.\n\n0:27:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Real.\n\n0:28:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Real.\n\n0:28:01\tSPEAKER_02\n For the.\n\n0:28:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Real reaction.\n\n0:28:04\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm not quite sure.\n\n0:28:07\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a.\n\n0:28:08\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a.\n\n0:28:09\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a.\n\n0:28:10\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a.\n\n0:28:11\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a.\n\n0:28:12\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a.\n\n0:28:13\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a.\n\n0:28:14\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a.\n\n0:28:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:16\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:28:17\tSPEAKER_02\n So.\n\n0:28:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Having the.\n\n0:28:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Feature and the voice recognition.\n\n0:28:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:22\tSPEAKER_02\n So it's.\n\n0:28:23\tSPEAKER_03\n We've.\n\n0:28:24\tSPEAKER_03\n We've put in.\n\n0:28:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Or.\n\n0:28:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Then maybe they could be.\n\n0:28:28\tSPEAKER_03\n A different shape.\n\n0:28:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Like we've got a cherry one.\n\n0:28:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe the other ones could be.\n\n0:28:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Something else shaped.\n\n0:28:34\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:28:35\tSPEAKER_03\n I've seen as soon as it's cheaper to make them a different.\n\n0:28:40\tSPEAKER_03\n As soon as we've got, you know, we've made it.\n\n0:28:43\tSPEAKER_03\n The special form.\n\n0:28:44\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:28:45\tSPEAKER_03\n And that would sort of maybe keep us.\n\n0:28:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Close on the sort of fashion type one.\n\n0:28:51\tSPEAKER_03\n And it would sort of.\n\n0:28:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Keep it quite fancy as well.\n\n0:28:54\tSPEAKER_03\n You could argue you might do it once a year.\n\n0:28:57\tSPEAKER_01\n You would change.\n\n0:28:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Because of the moment you're making it right up.\n\n0:29:01\tSPEAKER_01\n So next year you could make next year's.\n\n0:29:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Model the same.\n\n0:29:05\tSPEAKER_01\n But have it as a.\n\n0:29:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Whatever.\n\n0:29:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Whatever a lemon.\n\n0:29:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:11\tSPEAKER_01\n A lemon lemon or something.\n\n0:29:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:13\tSPEAKER_03\n We're not.\n\n0:29:14\tSPEAKER_03\n We're not.\n\n0:29:15\tSPEAKER_03\n We're not.\n\n0:29:16\tSPEAKER_03\n We're not.\n\n0:29:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:29:18\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:29:20\tSPEAKER_03\n What we got rid of.\n\n0:29:21\tSPEAKER_03\n We got rid of.\n\n0:29:22\tSPEAKER_03\n The plastic.\n\n0:29:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:25\tSPEAKER_01\n The main thing with change really is the casing, isn't it?\n\n0:29:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:29\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we've saved quite a bit.\n\n0:29:31\tSPEAKER_02\n So we've just got the push-burned interface, which is my part of the shooting.\n\n0:29:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:35\tSPEAKER_02\n But.\n\n0:29:37\tSPEAKER_02\n It's maybe the sense of not having that.\n\n0:29:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe we've lost something in the animation side.\n\n0:29:43\tSPEAKER_02\n And it's, and it's like the most standard.\n\n0:29:47\tSPEAKER_03\n I think we've got rid of the rubber case.\n\n0:29:51\tSPEAKER_03\n But.\n\n0:29:52\tSPEAKER_03\n We've now.\n\n0:29:53\tSPEAKER_03\n We're now sort of got an extra form and an extra color for the buttons.\n\n0:29:58\tSPEAKER_03\n So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability.\n\n0:30:02\tSPEAKER_03\n We're pretty much the same.\n\n0:30:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:05\tSPEAKER_03\n So.\n\n0:30:06\tSPEAKER_03\n We could maybe put two again on that.\n\n0:30:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Anything else is stayed.\n\n0:30:11\tSPEAKER_02\n There's the same.\n\n0:30:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, Jesus certainly stayed.\n\n0:30:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, because of anything the special form is makes it.\n\n0:30:16\tSPEAKER_02\n It's easier to.\n\n0:30:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:19\tSPEAKER_03\n And the speech.\n\n0:30:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:22\tSPEAKER_02\n And then the corporate identity.\n\n0:30:23\tSPEAKER_01\n I think we've just got the same as maybe last.\n\n0:30:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Has the.\n\n0:30:27\tSPEAKER_03\n It's somehow the rubber.\n\n0:30:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, we play out.\n\n0:30:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Or rather, whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity.\n\n0:30:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe not.\n\n0:30:44\tSPEAKER_02\n I think more of the features of the actual control will be more important maybe in the.\n\n0:30:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:52\tSPEAKER_02\n That's the seconds.\n\n0:30:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Either way, I think we've made a fairly close to it.\n\n0:30:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:31:00\tSPEAKER_00\n But I mean.\n\n0:31:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:31:03\tSPEAKER_00\n But.\n\n0:31:04\tSPEAKER_00\n And the proper maybe.\n\n0:31:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Doing the whole thing in the kind of light she would have thought we'd have a busy.\n\n0:31:11\tSPEAKER_00\n And what color would you like to ask?\n\n0:31:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Is there.\n\n0:31:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe.\n\n0:31:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe it's like a set design.\n\n0:31:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, but you've got the company logo on there, which would.\n\n0:31:22\tSPEAKER_01\n In fact, will be a stick on badge.\n\n0:31:24\tSPEAKER_01\n So you're in a sense, you're comparing the product without the company logo.\n\n0:31:27\tSPEAKER_01\n And then you've got the space for it to stick it on.\n\n0:31:31\tSPEAKER_03\n What's the company color?\n\n0:31:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Did you get told that the company colors?\n\n0:31:35\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think so.\n\n0:31:37\tSPEAKER_01\n But in the sense that as you saw with the windows logo badge, it doesn't really matter.\n\n0:31:44\tSPEAKER_01\n There's virtually the way that you frame, you know, the windows badge on there.\n\n0:31:50\tSPEAKER_01\n It really doesn't matter what color it is.\n\n0:31:54\tSPEAKER_01\n So long as our company's logo is framed in the same way as that, whether like a black outline.\n\n0:32:00\tSPEAKER_01\n In fact, they've got black and white or black and silver.\n\n0:32:04\tSPEAKER_01\n So basically, even if you had a silver, the same color of silver on your display, because you've got effectively a double edging on the, on the logo, it means that it splits off what your logo is from the, from the product.\n\n0:32:20\tSPEAKER_01\n And that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it.\n\n0:32:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Because you've got sort of got point to play with if you really wanted to.\n\n0:32:28\tSPEAKER_03\n You could put in another.\n\n0:32:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, in this one, you've actually got three colors of buttons.\n\n0:32:34\tSPEAKER_01\n We decided that the blue ones were the standard color.\n\n0:32:39\tSPEAKER_01\n So you were talking about, we're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel, hidden away then, would all be standard.\n\n0:32:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Which may or may not be the case.\n\n0:32:58\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm just going to say the point to the possibility.\n\n0:33:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, yeah, but was it was a not a button you were thinking of on the, on the other, you know, on the second page, is it where that you were thinking of maybe having is a different color.\n\n0:33:16\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't think so.\n\n0:33:18\tSPEAKER_00\n I think if they were just small round blue buttons, maybe we could end up with that.\n\n0:33:25\tSPEAKER_02\n So for the one that gets sealed, the time we make it look good, and fit the kind of idea of what they want.\n\n0:33:32\tSPEAKER_02\n And then for the more functional buttons, you know, it's much better to have that as like a, because it's hidden away anyway in these years stuff.\n\n0:33:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:39\tSPEAKER_03\n And it's a sort of thing that, I mean, you want to pick up the controller and just hit a button.\n\n0:33:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Great thing to change the channel on volume.\n\n0:33:44\tSPEAKER_03\n So if it's dead obvious, then that's fine.\n\n0:33:46\tSPEAKER_03\n If you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning, then you're paying a bit more attention.\n\n0:33:51\tSPEAKER_03\n So maybe sort of different color buttons isn't so important.\n\n0:33:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:56\tSPEAKER_01\n So we just add that to profitability and effect.\n\n0:33:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:00\tSPEAKER_03\n You still drop the cost.\n\n0:34:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:34:03\tSPEAKER_01\n So we're meant to finish up in five minutes.\n\n0:34:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Same sort of function.\n\n0:34:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Quite to you.\n\n0:34:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Sorry.\n\n0:34:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Just made a little money.\n\n0:34:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Should we only lose a point in fashion for the sake of lost the overall spend?\n\n0:34:27\tSPEAKER_00\n It doesn't seem right, but it just hasn't changed at all.\n\n0:34:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, we said that because you got rid of the rubber, we put an extra, an extra sort of, um, shape on one of the buttons.\n\n0:34:40\tSPEAKER_03\n We could have lemon shaped ones for the volume ones.\n\n0:34:47\tSPEAKER_03\n That's a good idea.\n\n0:34:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Did you have to have a rubber case go for rubber buttons?\n\n0:35:13\tSPEAKER_01\n I wasn't the way around.\n\n0:35:15\tSPEAKER_01\n So we're okay this way, right?\n\n0:35:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:26\tSPEAKER_03\n So what better we want to do?\n\n0:35:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:01\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll do it.\n\n0:36:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:36:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Just in case we have a point two for lost these.\n\n0:36:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, rats of a bunch that over there.\n\n0:36:27\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:28\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:35\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:44\tSPEAKER_00\n So what we even thought of in Parker on that scale?\n\n0:36:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, right.\n\n0:36:54\tSPEAKER_03\n For one thought.\n\n0:36:57\tSPEAKER_03\n But it really has to fit into the budget.\n\n0:36:59\tSPEAKER_03\n So I guess we just have to adjust things to get it in the...\n\n0:37:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Which is better.\n\n0:37:07\tSPEAKER_02\n And we seem to madly something in this criteria.\n\n0:37:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:14\tSPEAKER_02\n I think...\n\n0:37:15\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know if we'll fall, they wish us to be quite cheap.\n\n0:37:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Just about to be cheap.\n\n0:37:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:22\tSPEAKER_00\n So do you have any problems with this stuff?\n\n0:37:32\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:37:35\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know if we can get it in the future.\n\n0:37:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:37:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Don't you?\n\n0:37:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Don't let it fall down to you.\n\n0:38:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:38:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:38:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:38:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:38:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:38:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:38:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:38:28\tSPEAKER_01\n So we'll go.\n\n0:38:31\tSPEAKER_01\n So we've done the finance bit and the Excel project and we've done the redesign.\n\n0:38:37\tSPEAKER_01\n So we're now on to project process, satisfaction with, for example, room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, means access to work for a digital plan, access to...\n\n0:38:48\tSPEAKER_01\n So we're actually now in essence onto the evaluation of the course, rather than the evaluation of the project as my understanding of it.\n\n0:38:58\tSPEAKER_01\n So what did you...\n\n0:39:01\tSPEAKER_01\n And remembering that nobody's sister with a curtain.\n\n0:39:07\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:39:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Finish on moving now.\n\n0:39:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Which is good for us to play.\n\n0:39:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:39:17\tNone\n So...\n\n0:39:19\tSPEAKER_01\n As opposed to the easiest way of doing it, is to put some notes down, which I will do.\n\n0:39:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:39:28\tSPEAKER_01\n So I think you have to finish that page.\n\n0:39:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:39:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:39:34\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:39:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Project evaluation.\n\n0:39:44\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:39:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Creativity.\n\n0:39:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Do you feel you've got a chance to express yourselves well enough?\n\n0:39:55\tSPEAKER_03\n I've got some of the divisions in between the sort of individual meetings, but the arbitrary individual meeting.\n\n0:40:05\tSPEAKER_01\n I do, right?\n\n0:40:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:40:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, we were finding out various things in...\n\n0:40:10\tSPEAKER_03\n In your own.\n\n0:40:12\tSPEAKER_03\n In between the meetings.\n\n0:40:14\tSPEAKER_03\n The one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one.\n\n0:40:18\tSPEAKER_03\n There were things thrown in, the second meeting where...\n\n0:40:22\tSPEAKER_03\n You've looked at them, the remote controls, and seen the coveness part.\n\n0:40:26\tSPEAKER_03\n In the first one, you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons.\n\n0:40:31\tSPEAKER_03\n And I've got to understand why it would be in separate meetings.\n\n0:40:34\tSPEAKER_03\n But you'd do that, you'd sit and...\n\n0:40:36\tSPEAKER_03\n You'd probably present it one or something like that.\n\n0:40:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, the only thing you find is in a manufacturing process.\n\n0:40:43\tSPEAKER_01\n You would...\n\n0:40:44\tSPEAKER_01\n No, you go to a meeting, you'd say, right, you do this, you do that, you do that.\n\n0:40:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Then you go away, you find out information.\n\n0:40:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Then you come back, you then discuss it, you then go and change things around and then go back.\n\n0:40:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, this is the way you would be going out finding more information.\n\n0:40:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, this time you're really getting from a database or so.\n\n0:41:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:41:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Anyway, so what do you want to put down?\n\n0:41:06\tSPEAKER_01\n I've put, seemed okay, creativity, seemed okay.\n\n0:41:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Flow of information on any given subject.\n\n0:41:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Any given subject.\n\n0:41:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Subject.\n\n0:41:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Sometimes disjointed.\n\n0:41:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:41:29\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it really could have been slightly more creative project.\n\n0:41:34\tSPEAKER_00\n But in a remote control, isn't the most...\n\n0:41:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, the things...\n\n0:41:40\tSPEAKER_00\n No, it can't be done.\n\n0:41:42\tSPEAKER_00\n I can't think of a better example.\n\n0:41:45\tSPEAKER_01\n It could have used a different example to increase...\n\n0:41:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, creativity.\n\n0:41:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Is there a specific set of something everyone knows about and then creativity?\n\n0:42:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Something that kind of looks like...\n\n0:42:04\tSPEAKER_01\n You have to do it with an asset timeframe as the other thing.\n\n0:42:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:08\tSPEAKER_03\n I always think it's a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control.\n\n0:42:15\tSPEAKER_03\n It depends on sort of business here in I guess.\n\n0:42:17\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, this one seems to be one.\n\n0:42:19\tSPEAKER_03\n On the website it looks like it's quite innovative, but we're going out with some bookish shop product.\n\n0:42:25\tSPEAKER_03\n First, it's one of the things that...\n\n0:42:27\tSPEAKER_02\n 50 queries.\n\n0:42:28\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not like a range of products.\n\n0:42:30\tSPEAKER_02\n I think...\n\n0:42:31\tSPEAKER_02\n That's in the hallway.\n\n0:42:32\tSPEAKER_02\n I guess this is going to send out...\n\n0:42:34\tSPEAKER_01\n But the other thing is that I mean, I'm guessing that they're trying to use this software to demonstrate how you could do a project.\n\n0:42:49\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, my wife at the moment, for instance, is acting as a computer for...\n\n0:42:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Normally, you've got a problem, so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed.\n\n0:43:05\tSPEAKER_01\n So what she's doing is she's having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can ask whatever question.\n\n0:43:17\tSPEAKER_01\n And then you...\n\n0:43:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Or the idea is that the whichever persons at the other end can point them in the right direction, either give them directly, give them help, or secondly, point them in the right direction either at the library or come back or go and see job logs or whatever.\n\n0:43:39\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:43:40\tSPEAKER_01\n And that was a project that I suspect similar to this because they were actually trying to debug the computer software to enable it to work.\n\n0:43:53\tSPEAKER_01\n And of course, you had machine crashing and various things going wrong.\n\n0:43:59\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:44:00\tSPEAKER_01\n All right, so we've got...\n\n0:44:03\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, if you look at their products on their website here, real reaction.\n\n0:44:09\tSPEAKER_03\n It's all pretty high tech, cutting edge.\n\n0:44:12\tSPEAKER_01\n New ideas found? Did we find any? No.\n\n0:44:15\tSPEAKER_02\n So it's quite good with this, the whiteboard, how the non-digital pen is placed there.\n\n0:44:19\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, what is that? Leadership, teamwork.\n\n0:44:23\tSPEAKER_03\n So we did find any idea of a kinetic remote control.\n\n0:44:27\tSPEAKER_03\n We've never seen one of them before.\n\n0:44:29\tSPEAKER_02\n There are batteries, I think.\n\n0:44:31\tSPEAKER_02\n All voice recognition, especially in a one-minute video.\n\n0:44:34\tSPEAKER_01\n You've got voice recognition computers.\n\n0:44:36\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not remote control.\n\n0:44:38\tSPEAKER_00\n What's a different application?\n\n0:44:41\tSPEAKER_02\n The same products, but together we're different ones.\n\n0:44:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Every reactant teamwork went.\n\n0:44:49\tSPEAKER_03\n That went okay.\n\n0:44:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I guess we all had some ideas.\n\n0:44:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:44:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Two, there we go.\n\n0:45:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Raise them up, play.\n\n0:45:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, okay.\n\n0:45:07\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't think so to put it.\n\n0:45:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Allow us to do anything.\n\n0:45:13\tSPEAKER_01\n The arbitrary.\n\n0:45:14\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, I don't think it's starting to fit it in with the rest of their products.\n\n0:45:18\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, I've got all these sort of high definition DVD and portable seven-inch light weight computer screens.\n\n0:45:30\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it, you know, one cheap remote control.\n\n0:45:35\tSPEAKER_01\n So we're meant to comment on leadership and the means, e.g. whiteboard, digital pens, etc.\n\n0:45:43\tSPEAKER_01\n New ideas, and new ideas, phones, was the other thing.\n\n0:45:50\tSPEAKER_00\n We all feel comment on leadership because we want a project manager.\n\n0:45:57\tSPEAKER_00\n So our experience in leadership wasn't really as much as yours.\n\n0:46:05\tSPEAKER_01\n No, I'm much more afraid of my kids.\n\n0:46:08\tSPEAKER_01\n But.\n\n0:46:11\tSPEAKER_01\n I certainly didn't get this computer to work as well as I would have liked.\n\n0:46:18\tSPEAKER_01\n However, I mean, so whiteboard, it's a really equipment.\n\n0:46:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, it worked.\n\n0:46:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Computer.\n\n0:46:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Computer could be a bit difficult at times.\n\n0:46:36\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, I don't, I'm not sure I see the value in these.\n\n0:46:41\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, they record what you write and then what to do with it.\n\n0:46:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Where do you get the recording?\n\n0:46:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Do you put it in computer or something?\n\n0:46:49\tSPEAKER_02\n There's a little, there's a little, there's not just for us, it's for these families.\n\n0:46:52\tSPEAKER_03\n There's a little, there's a little chip, I think, it was for the interesting thing.\n\n0:46:56\tSPEAKER_03\n It was like, produces a, I don't know, whether it just produces a big image or something, but it's a bit of a different kind of thing.\n\n0:47:06\tSPEAKER_03\n New ideas found, so one or two?\n\n0:47:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Kinetic powered remote control.\n\n0:47:13\tSPEAKER_00\n What was it, the one?\n\n0:47:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Vice.\n\n0:47:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:47:20\tSPEAKER_01\n And voice, was a voice activated?\n\n0:47:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Voice recognition.\n\n0:47:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Almost.\n\n0:47:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Other cost with the budget, yes, is the project evaluated.\n\n0:47:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:47:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Don't forget to complete final question, let me explain very then, celebration.\n\n0:48:02\tSPEAKER_03\n I think we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last thing.\n\n0:48:13\tSPEAKER_01\n So, don't worry.\n\n0:48:19\tSPEAKER_01\n So, really, I tried to save this last time at 12.3 and it doesn't seem to have saved anywhere.\n\n0:48:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Mind you, the figure last time was different, but it should be posted.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "SPEAKER is going to redo the spreadsheet.
