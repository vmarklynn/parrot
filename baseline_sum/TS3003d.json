late.\n\n0:00:27\tSPEAKER_02\n No broadly.\n\n0:00:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Good second traffic.\n\n0:00:29\tSPEAKER_01\n It's possible this time of day starts at 3 o'clock.\n\n0:00:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:00:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Let me see.\n\n0:00:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Our fourth and last meeting.\n\n0:00:47\tSPEAKER_01\n There he is.\n\n0:00:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:00:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, this is our last meeting.\n\n0:00:57\tSPEAKER_01\n This meeting we will discuss our final design.\n\n0:01:01\tSPEAKER_01\n And we will do some evaluation about not only the product, but also the project.\n\n0:01:09\tSPEAKER_01\n And then we're going to close the project today as well.\n\n0:01:13\tSPEAKER_01\n So after that you'll be free to go and spend all your money.\n\n0:01:19\tSPEAKER_01\n And this design, detailed design meeting, we will discuss the look and feel of the design, the usability interface design, and we will do the product evaluation.\n\n0:01:37\tSPEAKER_01\n In order to do that, we have this agenda.\n\n0:01:40\tSPEAKER_01\n We will have the prototype presentation first.\n\n0:01:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Then we will set up some evaluation criteria.\n\n0:01:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Then we will look at the finance.\n\n0:01:50\tSPEAKER_01\n We will have to see if everything we want to do is also possible within our budget.\n\n0:01:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Because everything goes money.\n\n0:01:59\tSPEAKER_01\n And the more functions you want to have, the more money it will cost.\n\n0:02:02\tSPEAKER_01\n So we have to see if it fits within the 12.5 euro per remote.\n\n0:02:08\tSPEAKER_01\n We will see that later.\n\n0:02:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Then we will do the project evaluation and the closing after that.\n\n0:02:15\tSPEAKER_01\n We've got 40 minutes.\n\n0:02:17\tSPEAKER_01\n So we will be finished at half past three.\n\n0:02:22\tSPEAKER_01\n But first, we will do the prototype presentation.\n\n0:02:30\tSPEAKER_01\n So if there's somebody else for it.\n\n0:02:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, this is what me and Richard came up with.\n\n0:02:42\tSPEAKER_00\n The default spot for the on-off button.\n\n0:02:45\tSPEAKER_00\n The mute button just below that.\n\n0:02:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Then there's the volume and channel selectors.\n\n0:02:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Simple plus minus button.\n\n0:02:55\tSPEAKER_00\n We thought of a help button.\n\n0:02:58\tSPEAKER_00\n If you hold it and you press another button, the help goes to the LCD screen.\n\n0:03:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Then there's the 0 to 1 to 0 buttons.\n\n0:03:09\tSPEAKER_00\n A button for a teletext.\n\n0:03:11\tSPEAKER_00\n A button for the subtitles and the company logo.\n\n0:03:16\tSPEAKER_00\n So it's rather simple prototype.\n\n0:03:20\tSPEAKER_00\n And we'll have to see from testing how the user's take it.\n\n0:03:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:03:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Is this the moment where we ask?\n\n0:03:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Where can I ask questions about the functionality?\n\n0:03:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Sure.\n\n0:03:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Just pop in at any time.\n\n0:03:37\tSPEAKER_02\n When you're in teletext, there are usually buttons where you just press it and you go to the next teletext page.\n\n0:03:47\tSPEAKER_04\n That's just the normal remote controls.\n\n0:03:54\tSPEAKER_04\n So you push it.\n\n0:03:56\tSPEAKER_04\n You come in page 100.\n\n0:04:00\tSPEAKER_04\n You can use the normal 1 to 0 buttons.\n\n0:04:04\tSPEAKER_04\n You can also use the better for changing the channel.\n\n0:04:11\tSPEAKER_04\n So the shifting better.\n\n0:04:15\tSPEAKER_04\n For shifting up in the teletext and shifting down.\n\n0:04:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:04:28\tSPEAKER_01\n But I thought in a few meetings earlier we tried to give it simple.\n\n0:04:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Just a few buttons and large buttons.\n\n0:04:43\tSPEAKER_01\n But I think these are all together.\n\n0:04:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Quite a few buttons.\n\n0:04:50\tSPEAKER_01\n So I'm wondering if we really need all of those buttons.\n\n0:04:56\tSPEAKER_00\n I think if you look at most controls, they've got more buttons than this.\n\n0:05:02\tSPEAKER_00\n And well, the on-off button is a necessity.\n\n0:05:06\tSPEAKER_00\n You can't drop that one.\n\n0:05:08\tSPEAKER_00\n The volume and channel buttons, you obviously need those.\n\n0:05:13\tSPEAKER_00\n The mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume down button twice.\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_00\n So we could cancel that one.\n\n0:05:22\tSPEAKER_00\n I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does.\n\n0:05:34\tSPEAKER_04\n Or you can build in when you press one button.\n\n0:05:38\tSPEAKER_04\n Long time.\n\n0:05:42\tSPEAKER_04\n We just discussed that already.\n\n0:05:44\tSPEAKER_04\n We think all people don't know that option.\n\n0:05:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, you can't leave out the number buttons, I guess.\n\n0:06:02\tSPEAKER_01\n And take some subtitles.\n\n0:06:05\tSPEAKER_00\n So it's rather basic already.\n\n0:06:09\tSPEAKER_02\n That's what I pointed out earlier, you just make control for just the TV. There's just not much to gain here.\n\n0:06:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:06:18\tSPEAKER_01\n So yeah, somebody about something about the design of the buttons there?\n\n0:06:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it's not a hard to draw on the whiteboard, but they're supposed to be equal sized round with a little logo on it for the volume, the triangle and stuff.\n\n0:06:37\tSPEAKER_04\n Just for recognition.\n\n0:06:39\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, and we don't need a letter or some remote controls.\n\n0:06:47\tSPEAKER_04\n Because we use the little display, we don't have to use it.\n\n0:06:54\tSPEAKER_00\n So for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons.\n\n0:06:58\tSPEAKER_00\n We have a different color than the case, so they jump out.\n\n0:07:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Because we only have 30 minutes left, I will move on to the finance part, which is pretty exciting to see if it's all possible what we want to do.\n\n0:07:21\tSPEAKER_01\n And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for 12.5 euros.\n\n0:07:34\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know if I'm building correctly, so just correct me if you see something wrong.\n\n0:07:40\tSPEAKER_01\n I counted two batteries, but maybe we can also use one.\n\n0:07:44\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know if it's possible.\n\n0:07:46\tSPEAKER_01\n It's rechargeable.\n\n0:07:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, let's do euros.\n\n0:07:53\tSPEAKER_01\n We need the advanced chip, so there's not much to save there.\n\n0:08:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Here we have the single curve.\n\n0:08:06\tSPEAKER_01\n We can see that the difference between end curves and the single curve is 1 euro.\n\n0:08:15\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know, but I think the single curve is good for the design and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control.\n\n0:08:26\tSPEAKER_01\n I think we have to keep that.\n\n0:08:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Then we have the case material supplements.\n\n0:08:31\tSPEAKER_01\n It's plastic. It's the cheapest one we need.\n\n0:08:35\tSPEAKER_01\n So that's not much to save either.\n\n0:08:38\tSPEAKER_01\n But then the biggest cost are the buttons. So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our cost though.\n\n0:08:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Because we will have to get 12.5 euros at the end.\n\n0:09:00\tSPEAKER_01\n So let's first count the buttons we have now.\n\n0:09:07\tSPEAKER_01\n That will be even more than 18 euros.\n\n0:09:15\tSPEAKER_01\n 17.\n\n0:09:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, including the help.\n\n0:09:31\tSPEAKER_01\n I think we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long or pressing down a number.\n\n0:09:38\tSPEAKER_01\n That saves us 1 euro already.\n\n0:09:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Then we have got 15, I think.\n\n0:09:45\tSPEAKER_02\n I assume you count the volume and channel for two buttons each.\n\n0:09:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Those are one.\n\n0:09:57\tSPEAKER_04\n I think actually there are two buttons.\n\n0:10:00\tSPEAKER_04\n It's just one better.\n\n0:10:04\tSPEAKER_04\n Two for one big bell.\n\n0:10:08\tSPEAKER_04\n But they are more expensive than the small ones.\n\n0:10:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but it's not stated in this.\n\n0:10:17\tSPEAKER_01\n So maybe we can make one button with the volume in the channel in one by pressing.\n\n0:10:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I think maybe you can just integrate three of those numbers to one button.\n\n0:10:30\tSPEAKER_02\n That's the possibility as well.\n\n0:10:34\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's good for the design as well.\n\n0:10:44\tSPEAKER_01\n It looks a bit like a cross.\n\n0:11:10\tSPEAKER_04\n I think they count the materials.\n\n0:11:25\tSPEAKER_04\n It's not a better one itself, but on the chip there.\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_01\n But I think because we have the advanced chip, we can just count this as one button.\n\n0:11:44\tSPEAKER_02\n But now that I think this really is for buttons.\n\n0:11:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe it is, but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get 12 and a half euros.\n\n0:12:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Also the LC display.\n\n0:12:03\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's too expensive for the display we use.\n\n0:12:10\tSPEAKER_00\n If we leave out the display, we can also save money on the chip.\n\n0:12:17\tSPEAKER_01\n That's right.\n\n0:12:18\tSPEAKER_01\n But what's the biggest foundation of our remote then?\n\n0:12:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Only the docking station, I guess.\n\n0:12:29\tSPEAKER_00\n But the docking station isn't even in this schematic.\n\n0:12:34\tSPEAKER_01\n No, it's not even taken into the price.\n\n0:12:38\tSPEAKER_01\n That's extra.\n\n0:12:39\tSPEAKER_01\n That's right.\n\n0:12:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe we should move to a different supplier.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_01\n That's an option.\n\n0:12:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Poland, something.\n\n0:12:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Polish player.\n\n0:12:50\tSPEAKER_01\n If we can count this as one button and integrate these buttons in three, then we save a lot of money as well.\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_00\n We could save money on it, but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people?\n\n0:13:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.\n\n0:13:11\tSPEAKER_00\n My mother can't even send a nasa-mess message.\n\n0:13:15\tSPEAKER_04\n That's a point.\n\n0:13:20\tSPEAKER_04\n We can't buy a remote control when you can use it.\n\n0:13:27\tSPEAKER_04\n We must stay below 1250.\n\n0:13:35\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier, more easy, maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little.\n\n0:13:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Especially since we have those nice features.\n\n0:13:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but we have to stick to the 1250.\n\n0:14:02\tSPEAKER_01\n We don't have any more budget to the market.\n\n0:14:06\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a little bit too small.\n\n0:14:09\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:10\tSPEAKER_04\n It's possible to make one for 1250.\n\n0:14:14\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't think so.\n\n0:14:15\tSPEAKER_01\n If you leave out the LCD display and if you use less buttons, say...\n\n0:14:25\tSPEAKER_01\n You can do it with a single chip.\n\n0:14:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:32\tSPEAKER_04\n You want to make a bit than fancy and good looking.\n\n0:14:45\tSPEAKER_04\n With an effective option.\n\n0:14:50\tSPEAKER_04\n You can stay below 1250.\n\n0:14:55\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's difficult as well.\n\n0:14:58\tSPEAKER_02\n We can actually be a choice between either a good remote and a higher production cost or just any other remote control.\n\n0:15:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Or we can leave out the 10 buttons and take one scroll wheel for the program numbers.\n\n0:15:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Then we save 10 buttons and we have 5 and 1.\n\n0:15:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Let's see if we have this one and we've got the advanced.\n\n0:15:34\tSPEAKER_00\n We're getting closer.\n\n0:15:35\tSPEAKER_00\n We can't get closer.\n\n0:15:38\tSPEAKER_02\n How would a scroll wheel work here?\n\n0:15:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe you can scroll.\n\n0:15:53\tSPEAKER_01\n If you scroll, you will see the numbers on the LCD display until you've got the right number and you push it.\n\n0:16:01\tSPEAKER_02\n That would bring up the price of the scroll wheel also.\n\n0:16:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, but then you can push some other buttons as well.\n\n0:16:13\tSPEAKER_00\n You could just not scroll for half a second.\n\n0:16:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:17\tSPEAKER_00\n That's right.\n\n0:16:18\tSPEAKER_01\n If you scroll to a number and you wait a half second, then it turns to that channel.\n\n0:16:22\tSPEAKER_02\n I think that would be the end of our usability.\n\n0:16:27\tSPEAKER_01\n It would definitely drop costs.\n\n0:16:31\tSPEAKER_01\n We need the battery.\n\n0:16:41\tSPEAKER_01\n The regular chip is not possible.\n\n0:16:44\tSPEAKER_00\n It has to be advanced.\n\n0:16:46\tSPEAKER_00\n If you want to use an LCD screen, you need an advanced chip.\n\n0:16:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Then we can save a Euro by a flat design.\n\n0:16:59\tSPEAKER_01\n That's an option we can...\n\n0:17:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Then we're almost there.\n\n0:17:05\tSPEAKER_00\n If you could just leave out one more button.\n\n0:17:11\tSPEAKER_04\n Or we have to skip the subtitle button.\n\n0:17:16\tSPEAKER_01\n That is a big advantage for us.\n\n0:17:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Can we integrate the text and the subtitles in one button?\n\n0:17:30\tSPEAKER_01\n If you push it...\n\n0:17:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Three titles.\n\n0:17:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Right now you just push the text button.\n\n0:17:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Go to page 888.\n\n0:17:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:38\tSPEAKER_02\n And the text disappears, but the subtitles stay there.\n\n0:17:42\tSPEAKER_04\n But if you push it, it's a bit too wide.\n\n0:17:45\tSPEAKER_00\n What if you have to scroll to page 888?\n\n0:17:49\tSPEAKER_02\n That could be just scroll to 8.\n\n0:17:53\tSPEAKER_02\n But then again, that would be just a pretty much an option for all their people.\n\n0:18:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Don't even know what a scroll wheel is.\n\n0:18:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Holding a remote with today's spec to have like ten buttons for the numbers 1 to 0.\n\n0:18:15\tSPEAKER_02\n There are only five buttons on it.\n\n0:18:19\tSPEAKER_02\n And a scroll wheel.\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_01\n I think if you make good advertisement on television and in the guide, you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel.\n\n0:18:35\tSPEAKER_01\n You just make it real simple.\n\n0:18:40\tSPEAKER_01\n It saves a lot of money and we can keep our LCD screen, which can provide extra information how to use the scroll wheel, how to use the other buttons as subtitles.\n\n0:18:52\tSPEAKER_01\n And it's good for the innovative design as well.\n\n0:18:58\tSPEAKER_01\n If you would erase these...\n\n0:19:03\tSPEAKER_01\n You're razor.\n\n0:19:10\tNone\n Hey, we could put...\n\n0:19:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Looks a bit odd, maybe.\n\n0:19:29\tSPEAKER_02\n That's a pretty big scroll wheel.\n\n0:19:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Something like that.\n\n0:19:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Then we've got the scroll wheel.\n\n0:20:00\tSPEAKER_01\n If we erase this one...\n\n0:20:08\tSPEAKER_01\n These are two buttons then.\n\n0:20:26\tSPEAKER_00\n We could wake two buttons out of that.\n\n0:20:31\tSPEAKER_00\n If you press the volume button, you can control the volume with the scroll wheel.\n\n0:20:38\tSPEAKER_00\n So that would save two buttons if you do the same for the channel.\n\n0:20:43\tSPEAKER_01\n That's really a good idea.\n\n0:20:51\tSPEAKER_01\n And that will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious.\n\n0:20:56\tSPEAKER_01\n So we make one for the volume, one for the channel.\n\n0:21:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Please scroll.\n\n0:21:11\tSPEAKER_01\n So if we...\n\n0:21:14\tSPEAKER_01\n That's right.\n\n0:21:15\tSPEAKER_01\n So we've got one, two, three.\n\n0:21:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, we can leave the text in if we want.\n\n0:21:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:23\tSPEAKER_00\n That's me so it's better.\n\n0:21:26\tSPEAKER_00\n If we leave out all those buttons perhaps you can go with the flat case and make it smaller overall.\n\n0:21:34\tSPEAKER_00\n So if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button, the screen right under that then the scroll button.\n\n0:21:45\tSPEAKER_00\n You get a much smaller remote.\n\n0:21:50\tSPEAKER_01\n So we can decrease this one to four buttons.\n\n0:21:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Right now we have five buttons.\n\n0:21:59\tSPEAKER_04\n You can make quite a big remote control for just the same price as a small one.\n\n0:22:07\tSPEAKER_04\n You have to pay for the double curved or single curved.\n\n0:22:14\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's more the moles in which they are being made I think.\n\n0:22:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Single curved is really easy to just fill in and cases come right out of the machine.\n\n0:22:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Single curved you have to have a different machine than a flat one.\n\n0:22:32\tSPEAKER_01\n I think this is a really easy one.\n\n0:22:36\tSPEAKER_01\n But does everybody think about the flat or single curved design?\n\n0:22:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Well I still think we should go for the single curved design.\n\n0:22:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Richard argument was very good.\n\n0:22:52\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:53\tSPEAKER_02\n We have to cut costs.\n\n0:22:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:59\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm going to just go to the board and ask for more money.\n\n0:23:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:14\tSPEAKER_01\n But I think we can then keep the single curved one just to express our LCD screen a bit more.\n\n0:23:23\tSPEAKER_01\n So people will use it more and especially for the help functions.\n\n0:23:27\tSPEAKER_01\n It will be good if we have scroll bar scroll button.\n\n0:23:31\tSPEAKER_01\n It will be necessary to have a good help function as well.\n\n0:23:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Sorry this is scroll.\n\n0:23:55\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it was better to have this price this bit earlier before we went on to the whole design.\n\n0:24:05\tSPEAKER_01\n But I'm glad we could make a bit.\n\n0:24:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:11\tSPEAKER_01\n That's pretty different.\n\n0:24:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:13\tSPEAKER_01\n So all the last one.\n\n0:24:14\tSPEAKER_02\n And this one.\n\n0:24:15\tSPEAKER_02\n This is not really like for the group we were making or remote.\n\n0:24:19\tSPEAKER_02\n This will really require a lot of marketing.\n\n0:24:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:25\tSPEAKER_02\n And to get this to sell.\n\n0:24:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Because if other people like familiar forms and familiar stuff, this is not familiar for them.\n\n0:24:35\tSPEAKER_02\n No, but I think we have to do a lot of convincing them.\n\n0:24:38\tSPEAKER_04\n I think the most.\n\n0:24:39\tSPEAKER_04\n But they know the scroll buttons from old radio.\n\n0:24:42\tSPEAKER_04\n They also buttons like that for changing.\n\n0:24:46\tSPEAKER_01\n We can let it.\n\n0:24:48\tSPEAKER_01\n We can stick it out.\n\n0:24:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Like old buttons.\n\n0:24:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe that's recognizable for them as well.\n\n0:24:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:57\tSPEAKER_01\n That's a good one.\n\n0:24:59\tSPEAKER_01\n So I'm afraid we have to move on.\n\n0:25:03\tSPEAKER_01\n And it's less frightening I think if they see this design they think there are only five buttons.\n\n0:25:13\tSPEAKER_01\n But we will see.\n\n0:25:14\tSPEAKER_02\n But it might be confusing too.\n\n0:25:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:17\tSPEAKER_02\n But it's very special.\n\n0:25:20\tSPEAKER_04\n So I would buy.\n\n0:25:23\tNone\n Yeah, but you're not 60.\n\n0:25:24\tSPEAKER_01\n That's right.\n\n0:25:25\tSPEAKER_01\n I would buy if I was 60.\n\n0:25:27\tSPEAKER_01\n No, I didn't know.\n\n0:25:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Articus and 12 and all of you rose?\n\n0:25:32\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:25:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, they are.\n\n0:25:35\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:25:36\tSPEAKER_01\n No, but we can go on with the project evaluation.\n\n0:25:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Let's see.\n\n0:25:47\tSPEAKER_01\n I can sit down I think we still have 15 minutes left so nice on schedule.\n\n0:25:54\tSPEAKER_01\n The project process.\n\n0:25:57\tSPEAKER_02\n So I like set up all these criteria.\n\n0:26:02\tSPEAKER_02\n A valuation criteria.\n\n0:26:04\tSPEAKER_02\n That's right.\n\n0:26:05\tSPEAKER_01\n That was the thingy.\n\n0:26:06\tSPEAKER_01\n The point I forgot.\n\n0:26:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Shoot.\n\n0:26:09\tSPEAKER_01\n There we are.\n\n0:26:12\tSPEAKER_01\n If the evaluation could do you.\n\n0:26:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Thank you.\n\n0:26:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Go ahead.\n\n0:26:18\tSPEAKER_01\n We've got five minutes I think.\n\n0:26:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Five more minutes.\n\n0:26:22\tSPEAKER_01\n No, we've got 15 minutes.\n\n0:26:25\tSPEAKER_01\n But okay.\n\n0:26:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:26:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, so I did some literature study.\n\n0:26:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Analysis of the requirements we set up earlier.\n\n0:26:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Translated it into criteria.\n\n0:26:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Which would be these.\n\n0:26:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Is the remote fancy?\n\n0:26:55\tSPEAKER_02\n The shape looking few?\n\n0:26:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Inovative.\n\n0:26:58\tSPEAKER_02\n What new functions are there?\n\n0:27:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Easy to use.\n\n0:27:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Learnability is a very important factor here.\n\n0:27:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Is it functional?\n\n0:27:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Are there not too many functions?\n\n0:27:11\tSPEAKER_02\n A amount of functions and are those functions that are there?\n\n0:27:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Are they useful?\n\n0:27:17\tSPEAKER_02\n And the cost.\n\n0:27:20\tSPEAKER_02\n The target group is the remote really for the group we're making it for.\n\n0:27:26\tSPEAKER_02\n And great cognitive ability.\n\n0:27:29\tSPEAKER_02\n If our company is if it is easily recognizable, there are company made it.\n\n0:27:36\tSPEAKER_02\n So we're supposed to be evaluated right now.\n\n0:27:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:27:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's see.\n\n0:27:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, I have to say this was a little hard because the minutes over the last meeting.\n\n0:27:52\tSPEAKER_02\n We're not here.\n\n0:27:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that's because my pen failed to upload his data.\n\n0:27:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:27:58\tSPEAKER_01\n I tried to, but it's giving errors.\n\n0:28:01\tSPEAKER_01\n It's giving errors by downloading software.\n\n0:28:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:28:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Is the design fancy on a scale of 1 to 7?\n\n0:28:10\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's fancy.\n\n0:28:12\tSPEAKER_04\n Six.\n\n0:28:14\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:15\tSPEAKER_04\n You'll go for six.\n\n0:28:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Good.\n\n0:28:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Is the design inovative?\n\n0:28:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Very.\n\n0:28:26\tSPEAKER_01\n I'll see these same titles.\n\n0:28:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Seven.\n\n0:28:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Seven?\n\n0:28:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:36\tSPEAKER_02\n So we've got 20 cents for our docking station.\n\n0:28:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Should we do all?\n\n0:28:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Is the design easy to use?\n\n0:28:44\tSPEAKER_01\n That's a bit...\n\n0:28:46\tNone\n\u00e5\u009c\u009fy.\n\n0:28:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, would be for us, but...\n\n0:28:50\tSPEAKER_01\n I would say four.\n\n0:28:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Four or five.\n\n0:28:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Four or five.\n\n0:28:54\tSPEAKER_01\n I'd go for four or two.\n\n0:28:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Is it functional?\n\n0:29:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Is the design functional?\n\n0:29:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Do we have all functions that we want to include?\n\n0:29:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:29:07\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we do.\n\n0:29:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Do we have too many functions?\n\n0:29:10\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:29:11\tSPEAKER_02\n No, I don't think so.\n\n0:29:12\tSPEAKER_01\n It's pretty slow.\n\n0:29:13\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's seven.\n\n0:29:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Seven?\n\n0:29:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, and do we...\n\n0:29:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control, like it getting lost, and...\n\n0:29:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Sorry, I haven't thought of that one.\n\n0:29:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Of course.\n\n0:29:32\tSPEAKER_01\n I think we do.\n\n0:29:33\tSPEAKER_01\n I had them worked out.\n\n0:29:38\tSPEAKER_01\n They're ugly, not very functional, and getting lost.\n\n0:29:44\tSPEAKER_02\n But the production costs within the preset limits?\n\n0:29:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, they are now.\n\n0:29:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Does the design fit the group of focus?\n\n0:29:58\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that's a free.\n\n0:30:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:01\tSPEAKER_01\n No, I think with a new radio button, I think it's better.\n\n0:30:07\tSPEAKER_04\n We have the test.\n\n0:30:08\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, no.\n\n0:30:09\tSPEAKER_00\n I still...\n\n0:30:10\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's too fancy to flash...\n\n0:30:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Radio button is not exactly what older people expect of remote control.\n\n0:30:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, true.\n\n0:30:23\tSPEAKER_01\n How we give it a four?\n\n0:30:29\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm not sure.\n\n0:30:30\tSPEAKER_02\n I think I'd go for two.\n\n0:30:31\tSPEAKER_02\n I'd go for three.\n\n0:30:33\tSPEAKER_03\n That way I'll have to do it three.\n\n0:30:35\tSPEAKER_03\n It's good.\n\n0:30:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Is the company recognizable?\n\n0:30:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, it is.\n\n0:30:46\tSPEAKER_02\n It's the logo there.\n\n0:30:48\tSPEAKER_02\n So...\n\n0:30:52\tSPEAKER_01\n And they want to put fashion in their products in the slogan of the company.\n\n0:30:58\tSPEAKER_01\n We have the removable front cases.\n\n0:31:02\tSPEAKER_01\n So I think it's very recognizable.\n\n0:31:10\tSPEAKER_02\n There will be this.\n\n0:31:15\tSPEAKER_02\n I was also supposed to calculate the score, but...\n\n0:31:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Thought we would have another private...\n\n0:31:21\tSPEAKER_02\n We've got a calculator after this.\n\n0:31:25\tSPEAKER_00\n 20.\n\n0:31:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Like after this are we done?\n\n0:31:28\tSPEAKER_01\n We've got the...\n\n0:31:30\tSPEAKER_02\n We've evaluated.\n\n0:31:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, anyhow, these are seven factors.\n\n0:31:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Time seven is 40.\n\n0:31:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Something, two.\n\n0:31:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Nine.\n\n0:31:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Nine.\n\n0:31:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Nine.\n\n0:31:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Nine is 49.\n\n0:31:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Minus one.\n\n0:31:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Minus three.\n\n0:31:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Minus four.\n\n0:31:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Minus four.\n\n0:31:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Minus eight.\n\n0:31:56\tSPEAKER_02\n 41.\n\n0:31:57\tSPEAKER_02\n 41.\n\n0:31:58\tNone\n Out of 49.\n\n0:31:59\tSPEAKER_01\n That's...\n\n0:32:05\tSPEAKER_03\n All right, 80%.\n\n0:32:08\tSPEAKER_02\n I guess we'll just touch the name on the bottom here.\n\n0:32:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Does 84%.\n\n0:32:22\tSPEAKER_01\n I think that's a pretty nice score.\n\n0:32:25\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:32:39\tSPEAKER_02\n So that will be the evaluation.\n\n0:32:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:32:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Thank you.\n\n0:32:46\tSPEAKER_01\n So that brings us to the project evaluation.\n\n0:32:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Thank you.\n\n0:32:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Project process.\n\n0:32:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Did we move through the right faces, you think, along the process?\n\n0:33:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:33:05\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:06\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we should have had the finance thing a lot earlier.\n\n0:33:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:12\tSPEAKER_02\n That's right.\n\n0:33:13\tSPEAKER_02\n In the design phase.\n\n0:33:14\tSPEAKER_01\n So lack of information about prices.\n\n0:33:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:19\tSPEAKER_01\n That's true.\n\n0:33:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:33:21\tSPEAKER_01\n So this section was there room for creativity?\n\n0:33:33\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:33:34\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:33:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Not too much now.\n\n0:33:37\tSPEAKER_02\n It's because of the finance.\n\n0:33:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:40\tSPEAKER_01\n There was no room but the finance.\n\n0:33:42\tSPEAKER_00\n The room was...\n\n0:33:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:44\tSPEAKER_02\n And I would have liked to go for the...\n\n0:33:50\tSPEAKER_02\n younger users also.\n\n0:33:53\tSPEAKER_02\n And just to be able to access internet and...\n\n0:33:57\tSPEAKER_02\n get something of your own.\n\n0:34:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Strictions.\n\n0:34:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Internet access.\n\n0:34:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:34:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Leadership.\n\n0:34:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Was it clear what everybody had to do?\n\n0:34:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:20\tSPEAKER_01\n According to their roles and functions.\n\n0:34:23\tSPEAKER_04\n Yes.\n\n0:34:24\tSPEAKER_04\n Teamwork.\n\n0:34:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Did it work out?\n\n0:34:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Working together.\n\n0:34:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Also, you two with...\n\n0:34:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it was okay.\n\n0:34:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Last phase.\n\n0:34:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Nice.\n\n0:34:34\tSPEAKER_00\n The tasks are very strictured so you can just do step by step.\n\n0:34:44\tSPEAKER_00\n It was very easy.\n\n0:34:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Searched tasks.\n\n0:34:50\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:34:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Were there means sufficient for the tasks that we had to do?\n\n0:34:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Or were there too much?\n\n0:34:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, the smart board...\n\n0:35:01\tSPEAKER_00\n The drawing is just a pain in the ass but...\n\n0:35:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Smartboard...\n\n0:35:06\tSPEAKER_00\n The digital pen is very nice.\n\n0:35:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:09\tSPEAKER_01\n If it wants to download this data.\n\n0:35:13\tNone\n Smartboard was...\n\n0:35:16\tSPEAKER_03\n You're dating.\n\n0:35:23\tSPEAKER_01\n So you brought in one of the flip over or...\n\n0:35:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Flip over or a more precise...\n\n0:35:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Fosters as well.\n\n0:35:45\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Flip over.\n\n0:35:49\tSPEAKER_04\n But if you want to share...\n\n0:35:52\tSPEAKER_04\n When you make a picture like this on the presentation.\n\n0:35:59\tSPEAKER_04\n It's easier to share it with other people.\n\n0:36:03\tSPEAKER_04\n So you can save it and put it on the internet or...\n\n0:36:08\tSPEAKER_04\n In the shared folder or...\n\n0:36:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I tried to open the file.\n\n0:36:14\tSPEAKER_02\n It's on my laptop but it didn't work.\n\n0:36:17\tSPEAKER_01\n You need the smartboard application I think.\n\n0:36:22\tSPEAKER_01\n But I think you can...\n\n0:36:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Should be possible.\n\n0:36:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, you can export this image.\n\n0:36:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Best.\n\n0:36:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, best be.\n\n0:36:31\tNone\n You should have done that.\n\n0:36:33\tSPEAKER_01\n So the sharing of the information was okay.\n\n0:36:37\tSPEAKER_01\n That's it.\n\n0:36:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, that's it.\n\n0:36:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I'm here on the table.\n\n0:36:44\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:45\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:46\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:47\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:48\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:49\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:50\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:51\tSPEAKER_04\n JPEG, VMP.\n\n0:36:52\tSPEAKER_01\n It's possible.\n\n0:36:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:36:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:36:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:36:57\tSPEAKER_01\n That's nice.\n\n0:36:58\tSPEAKER_01\n We found new IDs for...\n\n0:37:02\tSPEAKER_01\n I think this kind of meeting.\n\n0:37:08\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, maybe...\n\n0:37:11\tSPEAKER_04\n When we just gave the numbers of...\n\n0:37:18\tSPEAKER_04\n Of...\n\n0:37:19\tSPEAKER_04\n Of...\n\n0:37:20\tSPEAKER_04\n Of...\n\n0:37:21\tSPEAKER_04\n Of...\n\n0:37:22\tSPEAKER_04\n Of...\n\n0:37:23\tSPEAKER_04\n Of...\n\n0:37:24\tNone\n Of...\n\n0:37:24\tSPEAKER_04\n Of...\n\n0:37:25\tSPEAKER_04\n Of...\n\n0:37:26\tSPEAKER_04\n Of...\n\n0:37:27\tSPEAKER_04\n Of...\n\n0:37:28\tSPEAKER_04\n Of...\n\n0:37:29\tSPEAKER_04\n Of...\n\n0:37:30\tSPEAKER_04\n Of...\n\n0:37:31\tSPEAKER_04\n Of...\n\n0:37:32\tSPEAKER_04\n Of...\n\n0:37:33\tSPEAKER_04\n So...\n\n0:37:34\tSPEAKER_04\n So...\n\n0:37:35\tSPEAKER_04\n So...\n\n0:37:36\tSPEAKER_01\n So everybody puts his own score.\n\n0:37:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:39\tSPEAKER_01\n And then...\n\n0:37:40\tSPEAKER_01\n It mediates the score.\n\n0:37:41\tSPEAKER_01\n And you can get one...\n\n0:37:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:44\tSPEAKER_01\n That's better.\n\n0:37:45\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's...\n\n0:37:48\tSPEAKER_01\n How do we call it?\n\n0:37:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Inevaluation.\n\n0:38:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Inevaluation.\n\n0:38:02\tNone\n Inevaluation.\n\n0:38:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Criteria.\n\n0:38:05\tNone\n Criteria.\n\n0:38:07\tNone\n Criteria.\n\n0:38:08\tNone\n Criteria.\n\n0:38:10\tNone\n Criteria.\n\n0:38:12\tNone\n Criteria.\n\n0:38:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:38:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Any more IDs?\n\n0:38:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Or questions about the project or...\n\n0:38:20\tSPEAKER_01\n About the product?\n\n0:38:22\tSPEAKER_01\n It goes...\n\n0:38:29\tSPEAKER_01\n I think...\n\n0:38:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Then that we...\n\n0:38:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Get to our last week.\n\n0:38:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Articles within the budget?\n\n0:38:42\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Considering we are not going to make a docking station.\n\n0:38:50\tSPEAKER_01\n That's good.\n\n0:38:52\tSPEAKER_01\n But maybe because of the docking station, the...\n\n0:38:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Price of the remote can also be a little bit higher.\n\n0:38:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:39:01\tSPEAKER_01\n And I think you can compensate that as well.\n\n0:39:05\tSPEAKER_01\n So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem because it's very cheap to make as well.\n\n0:39:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Do we think we're going to get the 12.5 million?\n\n0:39:15\tSPEAKER_01\n What was it?\n\n0:39:16\tSPEAKER_01\n 15 million.\n\n0:39:17\tSPEAKER_01\n 15 million.\n\n0:39:18\tSPEAKER_01\n I think we will.\n\n0:39:21\tSPEAKER_01\n If you're going to export this product, it's innovative.\n\n0:39:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Especially in America.\n\n0:39:27\tSPEAKER_01\n People are pretty.\n\n0:39:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Take a dent.\n\n0:39:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Sometimes.\n\n0:39:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, still don't think...\n\n0:39:33\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, if we're going to make a scroll button anyway.\n\n0:39:37\tSPEAKER_02\n You can do more.\n\n0:39:38\tSPEAKER_02\n You can do more for the younger people and for the older people.\n\n0:39:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:39:42\tSPEAKER_02\n So maybe we should just refocus.\n\n0:39:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Just put it on the market for everybody.\n\n0:39:47\tSPEAKER_01\n You can...\n\n0:39:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Specifically for...\n\n0:39:49\tSPEAKER_01\n You can change markets by changing the front cover.\n\n0:39:53\tSPEAKER_01\n That's one thing you can change it with.\n\n0:39:56\tSPEAKER_01\n So you can also try to reach the younger people by putting fancy covers on the market.\n\n0:40:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Just as a test.\n\n0:40:05\tSPEAKER_01\n See how it works?\n\n0:40:07\tSPEAKER_01\n That's I think a good advantage.\n\n0:40:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I think then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is.\n\n0:40:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Then it would be with older people.\n\n0:40:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:40:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Even if it were there covers.\n\n0:40:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Then I think we can have our little celebration right now.\n\n0:40:29\tSPEAKER_01\n That's it.\n\n0:40:30\tSPEAKER_01\n I think we still have to fill in one more questioner.\n\n0:40:34\tSPEAKER_01\n I think...\n\n0:40:36\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:40:37\tSPEAKER_01\n I didn't get a message from the...\n\n0:40:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, I think I have one.\n\n0:40:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Five more minutes.\n\n0:40:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, let's guys.\n\n0:40:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Then we still have some questions.\n\n0:40:54\tSPEAKER_01\n If somebody has some questions they can ask them now.\n\n0:40:57\tSPEAKER_01\n We can put these in the project folder as well.\n\n0:41:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Let's get it.\n\n0:41:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Export is...\n\n0:41:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Picture I think?\n\n0:41:21\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:41:22\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:41:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Hmm.\n\n0:41:37\tSPEAKER_01\n This is another... that's work, I guess.\n\n0:41:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Is somebody see the project folder?\n\n0:41:53\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't.\n\n0:42:00\tSPEAKER_01\n My documents.\n\n0:42:06\tSPEAKER_04\n Maybe they will save it.\n\n0:42:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:10\tSPEAKER_01\n I'll just put it in my documents and...\n\n0:42:13\tSPEAKER_01\n That's okay.\n\n0:42:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:42:26\tSPEAKER_01\n I think I'm going to make our final presentation now.\n\n0:42:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, you're supposed to make it.\n\n0:42:33\tSPEAKER_01\n And then I will be back in about 10 minutes to show you the final presentation.\n\n0:42:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:42:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Summary of the project.\n\n0:42:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Are we supposed to go into our rooms again?\n\n0:42:46\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, maybe if the full...\n\n0:42:48\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:49\tSPEAKER_01\n No questioner.\n\n0:42:50\tSPEAKER_01\n I think you all get the questioner in your room.\n\n0:42:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:54\tSPEAKER_01\n And then I'll meet you and think about 10 minutes.\n\n0:42:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:42:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:42:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Hopefully my panel download is software.\n\n0:43:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:43:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Word data.\n\n0:43:09\tSPEAKER_02\n That would be nice.\n\n0:43:16\tNone\n Oh, oh...\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "It's
