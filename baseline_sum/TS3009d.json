on your own.\n\n0:00:10\tNone\n You don't say you became brown.\n\n0:00:13\tNone\n Well, that's not as a matter of speak.\n\n0:00:18\tSPEAKER_02\n They put some stress out.\n\n0:00:21\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm just relaxing.\n\n0:00:23\tNone\n You're going to stress out now.\n\n0:00:25\tNone\n So I'm going to...\n\n0:00:27\tNone\n Because?\n\n0:00:28\tNone\n We have to do some extra design.\n\n0:00:31\tNone\n You'll see.\n\n0:00:32\tSPEAKER_02\n You'll see.\n\n0:00:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Fourth meeting.\n\n0:00:35\tNone\n You have to do what?\n\n0:00:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Extra deciding.\n\n0:00:39\tSPEAKER_03\n What?\n\n0:00:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we'll see.\n\n0:00:43\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll show you the notes again.\n\n0:00:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Very interesting.\n\n0:00:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, you two will present us your prototype.\n\n0:00:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Then I guess that's your bit.\n\n0:00:56\tSPEAKER_02\n I didn't see anything about it.\n\n0:00:59\tSPEAKER_02\n I thought you would do that.\n\n0:01:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Then you were a telescope.\n\n0:01:05\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this design.\n\n0:01:11\tSPEAKER_01\n That's important too.\n\n0:01:13\tSPEAKER_02\n We'll evaluate after we have redesigned it.\n\n0:01:17\tSPEAKER_02\n We'll see about the costs.\n\n0:01:20\tSPEAKER_02\n We'll evaluate our production.\n\n0:01:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Then we can close.\n\n0:01:26\tNone\n All right.\n\n0:01:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, the finance world of later.\n\n0:01:30\tSPEAKER_02\n So, firstly, I'll show you the notes.\n\n0:01:34\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think it's very interesting.\n\n0:01:38\tSPEAKER_04\n I think it is.\n\n0:01:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, nay.\n\n0:01:41\tSPEAKER_02\n I'd never...\n\n0:01:46\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:01:52\tSPEAKER_02\n This is copy-paste.\n\n0:01:54\tSPEAKER_02\n For me, of course.\n\n0:01:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Of course.\n\n0:01:56\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a very strange layout.\n\n0:01:58\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a nice course.\n\n0:02:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, we went to the agenda.\n\n0:02:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, we had some presentations from you, tree.\n\n0:02:10\tSPEAKER_02\n I summarized what you said to us.\n\n0:02:14\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think it's very interesting to go to it again.\n\n0:02:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Repeat it.\n\n0:02:19\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:02:22\tSPEAKER_02\n This is what we decided.\n\n0:02:24\tSPEAKER_02\n It's also copy-paste from what we made together.\n\n0:02:27\tSPEAKER_02\n We still know that.\n\n0:02:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Then we can use the time better.\n\n0:02:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, next, you two will present the prototype for us.\n\n0:02:37\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:02:38\tSPEAKER_01\n We both will.\n\n0:02:39\tSPEAKER_04\n Or one as well.\n\n0:02:42\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:02:43\tSPEAKER_01\n So, make mistakes.\n\n0:02:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, this is our design.\n\n0:02:49\tSPEAKER_01\n It's pretty much like a mic draw drew during the last meeting.\n\n0:02:56\tSPEAKER_01\n With the different perspectives of it, we will begin with the front.\n\n0:03:01\tSPEAKER_01\n We have, of course, the round shape, the round basic shape, with the upper part being the front.\n\n0:03:10\tSPEAKER_01\n So, this part, which is made of hard plastic, the front.\n\n0:03:15\tSPEAKER_01\n And we're using different colors.\n\n0:03:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Of course, for the launch, we use the basic ugly colors.\n\n0:03:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Later, we'll put out more interesting colors with different patterns and pictures and everything.\n\n0:03:25\tSPEAKER_01\n But basically different colors.\n\n0:03:27\tSPEAKER_01\n White colors, not black, too dark, fancy color.\n\n0:03:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Then we have the lower part of the device, which is, of course, part of the back, actually, because it's also titanium.\n\n0:03:43\tSPEAKER_01\n You see it also on the side view that only this part is the front.\n\n0:03:48\tSPEAKER_01\n And the rest of it, the underside of it, the back side.\n\n0:03:53\tSPEAKER_01\n And the lower part of the front is, of course, titanium, made of titanium, and has the titanium color, of course, the look.\n\n0:04:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Then we have, on the back of the front, the logo in the upper corner, which is also part of the back, part of the titanium, titanium part.\n\n0:04:14\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a double R.\n\n0:04:16\tSPEAKER_04\n It's a double R.\n\n0:04:18\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a double R, yeah, the logo, it's a difficult to draw, so small, but it's our double R.\n\n0:04:23\tSPEAKER_01\n The logo is in there.\n\n0:04:25\tSPEAKER_01\n So, that's the logo in the upper left right corner.\n\n0:04:28\tSPEAKER_01\n And we have the buttons.\n\n0:04:30\tSPEAKER_01\n It's difficult to draw again.\n\n0:04:32\tSPEAKER_01\n The little oval around, I think, oval will be better for the...\n\n0:04:36\tSPEAKER_01\n For the...\n\n0:04:37\tSPEAKER_01\n For the...\n\n0:04:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Different channel buttons.\n\n0:04:40\tSPEAKER_01\n So, they're all oval, those are here, and then we have the...\n\n0:04:44\tSPEAKER_01\n The channel up and volume.\n\n0:04:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, the volume and the channel controls in the middle here.\n\n0:04:53\tSPEAKER_01\n With kind of arrow shapes, it makes it also a bit more exciting and basic.\n\n0:05:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Round or square buttons.\n\n0:05:07\tSPEAKER_01\n And then also here are the two buttons we agreed on.\n\n0:05:10\tSPEAKER_01\n We have the OK button.\n\n0:05:12\tSPEAKER_01\n The OK button is here in the middle of the...\n\n0:05:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Of the channel and volume changes.\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_01\n And then we have here the menu button and the...\n\n0:05:22\tSPEAKER_04\n All right, menu for the...\n\n0:05:23\tSPEAKER_01\n And the video button.\n\n0:05:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Right, so...\n\n0:05:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:26\tSPEAKER_01\n And of course, this is the low part, this is the LCD screen.\n\n0:05:29\tSPEAKER_00\n OK.\n\n0:05:30\tSPEAKER_01\n This is what we made of it.\n\n0:05:31\tSPEAKER_01\n You can make suggestions if you want.\n\n0:05:33\tSPEAKER_02\n If I look at it, decide.\n\n0:05:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe we should finish first our talk and then you can add to the...\n\n0:05:38\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know what to do.\n\n0:05:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I don't want to express you, but I'll finish this quick.\n\n0:05:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Go now.\n\n0:05:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, I've had everything, I guess, on the back.\n\n0:05:48\tSPEAKER_01\n On the back, with the...\n\n0:05:49\tSPEAKER_04\n On the back, yeah.\n\n0:05:50\tSPEAKER_01\n We thought about, yeah, the back is, of course, totally titanium.\n\n0:05:55\tSPEAKER_01\n And we thought about the logo big in the middle.\n\n0:05:58\tSPEAKER_01\n So, again, the double R.\n\n0:06:00\tSPEAKER_01\n We had then the logo on front and on the back.\n\n0:06:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe that's too much, but you have to say it if you think that way.\n\n0:06:08\tSPEAKER_01\n And the company slogan, we thought in a kind of arc shape above the logo.\n\n0:06:15\tSPEAKER_01\n That's basically what we were thinking about.\n\n0:06:18\tSPEAKER_04\n And about the side view.\n\n0:06:23\tSPEAKER_04\n This, the front won't be as thick, but again...\n\n0:06:26\tSPEAKER_04\n That drawing technique makes it very difficult to...\n\n0:06:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, and before I forget, the voice recording is at the bottom.\n\n0:06:36\tSPEAKER_01\n You can record it using a backup bar.\n\n0:06:39\tSPEAKER_02\n When I look at this side view, I think when I have that in my hand, it's terrible.\n\n0:06:46\tSPEAKER_02\n If you look, if this is thick, and this is thin, it's nice over your hand.\n\n0:06:52\tSPEAKER_02\n It fits the hand.\n\n0:06:53\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, I agree.\n\n0:06:56\tSPEAKER_02\n What I agree is that when you have such an arc in the middle, so that the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker.\n\n0:07:07\tSPEAKER_02\n So, then it falls over your hands.\n\n0:07:09\tSPEAKER_04\n If your handle will remote, you usually don't have your hand straight in the middle.\n\n0:07:13\tSPEAKER_03\n In the middle, you have it a bit.\n\n0:07:14\tSPEAKER_03\n It depends on the size.\n\n0:07:16\tSPEAKER_03\n If it's kind of small, this is great, but if it's larger, then you want to grab it.\n\n0:07:22\tSPEAKER_03\n How large is it?\n\n0:07:23\tSPEAKER_03\n That's the question.\n\n0:07:25\tSPEAKER_03\n That's the question.\n\n0:07:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, yeah.\n\n0:07:28\tSPEAKER_01\n What do you suggest, Andy?\n\n0:07:31\tSPEAKER_01\n It was Mike's prototype, and you seem to agree on it.\n\n0:07:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, the size, I haven't seen yet.\n\n0:07:37\tSPEAKER_02\n The size, yeah.\n\n0:07:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, the size doesn't really matter.\n\n0:07:40\tSPEAKER_01\n The size.\n\n0:07:41\tSPEAKER_00\n The size.\n\n0:07:42\tSPEAKER_01\n The size.\n\n0:07:43\tSPEAKER_01\n He drew the size.\n\n0:07:44\tSPEAKER_01\n You weren't paying attention, as usual.\n\n0:07:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, in any case, we'll discuss it now.\n\n0:07:50\tSPEAKER_01\n I think this is a pretty good idea.\n\n0:07:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I agree with the LCD screen.\n\n0:07:54\tSPEAKER_03\n You have it in your palm like this, and you can watch the screen.\n\n0:08:00\tSPEAKER_03\n And if you have it in the middle, your hand might be over it.\n\n0:08:04\tSPEAKER_01\n But you hold it like this.\n\n0:08:06\tSPEAKER_01\n You're not holding it like this, but something.\n\n0:08:08\tSPEAKER_04\n You're doing grab it.\n\n0:08:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, how do you call it then?\n\n0:08:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, you don't have it like this.\n\n0:08:15\tSPEAKER_01\n You have it more like this.\n\n0:08:17\tSPEAKER_01\n So you're using buttons this way, or like you're writing it.\n\n0:08:21\tSPEAKER_03\n So you have a screen on it.\n\n0:08:24\tSPEAKER_03\n You want to look at your screen.\n\n0:08:26\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, well, it falls into your hand, I think.\n\n0:08:30\tSPEAKER_01\n And maybe you can grab it a bit higher.\n\n0:08:34\tSPEAKER_03\n No, I don't think so.\n\n0:08:36\tSPEAKER_01\n That's the reason to put the LCD screen, of course, on the upside.\n\n0:08:42\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, as far as I can see, three of us agree.\n\n0:08:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, well, I think if you agree, then that's it.\n\n0:08:51\tSPEAKER_04\n You're the project manager.\n\n0:08:53\tSPEAKER_04\n You can make the hard decision.\n\n0:08:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:08:56\tSPEAKER_02\n But can you leave it like this?\n\n0:08:58\tSPEAKER_02\n All right, if you think that that's the way you should.\n\n0:09:01\tSPEAKER_01\n You said it was totally unuseable.\n\n0:09:03\tSPEAKER_02\n No, but do you?\n\n0:09:04\tSPEAKER_02\n No, when I, my personal taste is that I wanted to fall over my hands with a thick...\n\n0:09:10\tSPEAKER_01\n But you don't think this is completely unuseable, I guess.\n\n0:09:13\tSPEAKER_01\n I think not totally.\n\n0:09:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Not totally.\n\n0:09:16\tSPEAKER_02\n For me, I wouldn't buy it.\n\n0:09:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Of course, you are also human.\n\n0:09:20\tSPEAKER_01\n We have to take every one into account.\n\n0:09:25\tSPEAKER_03\n You might be a target customer.\n\n0:09:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Who else thinks like you?\n\n0:09:29\tSPEAKER_01\n We don't know.\n\n0:09:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe you're a thousand people.\n\n0:09:31\tSPEAKER_02\n But that's more market research.\n\n0:09:33\tSPEAKER_02\n So let it be like this at the latest moment.\n\n0:09:36\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:09:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, so that's that and you're the suggestions.\n\n0:09:40\tSPEAKER_02\n No, I think it's great.\n\n0:09:42\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:43\tSPEAKER_04\n But what about the redesigning?\n\n0:09:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Comes to that later.\n\n0:09:47\tSPEAKER_02\n You.\n\n0:09:48\tSPEAKER_02\n You can do it.\n\n0:09:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Wow, that's wonderful.\n\n0:09:51\tSPEAKER_01\n You're very pretty.\n\n0:09:52\tSPEAKER_02\n You can do the evaluation criteria on this.\n\n0:09:54\tSPEAKER_02\n All right, great.\n\n0:09:56\tSPEAKER_02\n That's more useful.\n\n0:09:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Then just speaking.\n\n0:10:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, this is just a short intro.\n\n0:10:09\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm going to do the evaluation.\n\n0:10:12\tSPEAKER_03\n This is going to be done at the end of seven point skill criteria.\n\n0:10:18\tSPEAKER_03\n So I made a few questions on the hand of the most important requirements and trends and we have to look if our if our device is working correctly.\n\n0:10:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, I put some questions in a word file.\n\n0:10:36\tSPEAKER_03\n See if I can find them.\n\n0:10:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, I think you have all seen this kind of evaluation.\n\n0:10:49\tSPEAKER_03\n So I don't have to explain it.\n\n0:10:51\tSPEAKER_03\n The first question is, is the device good looking?\n\n0:10:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Because most people thought that earlier the devices were ugly, ugly.\n\n0:11:02\tSPEAKER_03\n 75% of them.\n\n0:11:04\tSPEAKER_03\n So what do we think?\n\n0:11:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we designed it.\n\n0:11:08\tSPEAKER_01\n So of course, we are very.\n\n0:11:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, we're not quite objective about that.\n\n0:11:12\tSPEAKER_02\n No, but we need to be.\n\n0:11:13\tSPEAKER_03\n We have to evaluate it.\n\n0:11:16\tSPEAKER_03\n So I have to take this questionnaire.\n\n0:11:20\tSPEAKER_03\n So we have to answer now.\n\n0:11:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, we're changing the question.\n\n0:11:23\tSPEAKER_02\n You have to take this questionnaire.\n\n0:11:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but I can.\n\n0:11:25\tSPEAKER_02\n No, no, no, no, no.\n\n0:11:27\tSPEAKER_02\n But well, we can go because of the time.\n\n0:11:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Pretty quick through this.\n\n0:11:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Do we find it good looking?\n\n0:11:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, we think so.\n\n0:11:35\tSPEAKER_03\n I think you know, we designed it to be perfect.\n\n0:11:41\tSPEAKER_03\n So, but we have to be critical about it.\n\n0:11:45\tSPEAKER_03\n And I have to take all these points and get an average at the end.\n\n0:11:49\tSPEAKER_03\n So we know where we stand.\n\n0:11:51\tSPEAKER_03\n One.\n\n0:11:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Because there are some things we might have forgotten.\n\n0:11:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, so it's point four.\n\n0:11:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:11:58\tSPEAKER_03\n So let's start with the beginning.\n\n0:12:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Just one one.\n\n0:12:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Is it good looking?\n\n0:12:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I guess I think it's it's it's pointed towards the youth of course.\n\n0:12:09\tSPEAKER_01\n If you look at the design and the colors and everything, it was our target audience of course, but it's also not completely unacceptable for all the people, I guess.\n\n0:12:20\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not the type any it might be.\n\n0:12:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that's for all the people.\n\n0:12:27\tSPEAKER_01\n It's more that classic.\n\n0:12:28\tSPEAKER_03\n You put the black front on it or something.\n\n0:12:31\tSPEAKER_01\n No, I think yeah, they like black, of course, but I think they'll they think the titanium look of it is also.\n\n0:12:38\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's also good for them.\n\n0:12:39\tSPEAKER_01\n So I think we both consider consider it.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_01\n We consider it the youth and also a bit all the people.\n\n0:12:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:12:48\tSPEAKER_01\n It's very good looking and not only for youth young people.\n\n0:12:52\tSPEAKER_04\n I think we shouldn't discuss any points that long.\n\n0:12:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:12:57\tSPEAKER_04\n No, how many points there are about that?\n\n0:12:58\tSPEAKER_02\n I told you the 40.\n\n0:12:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:13:00\tSPEAKER_02\n A number please.\n\n0:13:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Get on.\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Is it easy to change channels?\n\n0:13:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, well, I think so.\n\n0:13:05\tSPEAKER_03\n So the last one is seven.\n\n0:13:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Easy to change channels.\n\n0:13:09\tSPEAKER_02\n No, it's not false.\n\n0:13:11\tSPEAKER_02\n It's one.\n\n0:13:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Sorry.\n\n0:13:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, right.\n\n0:13:14\tNone\n Well, two.\n\n0:13:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Ten channels.\n\n0:13:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, we have to go to it.\n\n0:13:19\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's as easy as can be made.\n\n0:13:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:13:23\tSPEAKER_01\n So I, yeah, how can you make it any easier?\n\n0:13:27\tSPEAKER_03\n The power channel and volume buttons are easy accessible.\n\n0:13:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, you would use it.\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Two.\n\n0:13:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Two.\n\n0:13:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:13:36\tSPEAKER_03\n The device is easy to find if you lose it.\n\n0:13:39\tSPEAKER_02\n No, we don't have anything about that.\n\n0:13:42\tSPEAKER_04\n We don't have that.\n\n0:13:43\tSPEAKER_04\n It's easier to find than a normal black one on something.\n\n0:13:46\tSPEAKER_04\n Of course, we call it.\n\n0:13:47\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, six.\n\n0:13:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Six.\n\n0:13:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we don't have to devise that beep so when you lost it at all.\n\n0:13:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Functions easy to learn.\n\n0:13:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, we do want to have a...\n\n0:13:56\tSPEAKER_02\n You have so few films.\n\n0:13:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Less one.\n\n0:13:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:59\tSPEAKER_03\n I agree.\n\n0:14:00\tSPEAKER_02\n And the device are as I sensitive.\n\n0:14:02\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:14:03\tSPEAKER_04\n I feel too.\n\n0:14:04\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:05\tSPEAKER_04\n Because the voice recorded.\n\n0:14:07\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:09\tSPEAKER_04\n Self learning.\n\n0:14:10\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:14:13\tSPEAKER_03\n All right.\n\n0:14:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Two.\n\n0:14:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but just do something.\n\n0:14:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:18\tSPEAKER_02\n We need...\n\n0:14:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Are we taking too much time?\n\n0:14:21\tSPEAKER_02\n I think this is two time consuming.\n\n0:14:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Not two.\n\n0:14:24\tSPEAKER_02\n I agree.\n\n0:14:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Not two words.\n\n0:14:26\tSPEAKER_02\n This is how you have to put this to the customers.\n\n0:14:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Erase sensitive.\n\n0:14:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, a little bit.\n\n0:14:33\tSPEAKER_02\n So four.\n\n0:14:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Four.\n\n0:14:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:14:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, very much.\n\n0:14:37\tSPEAKER_02\n One.\n\n0:14:38\tSPEAKER_02\n One and features included.\n\n0:14:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Also one.\n\n0:14:40\tSPEAKER_02\n And.\n\n0:14:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, those nine is defensive looking.\n\n0:14:47\tSPEAKER_02\n We still think so.\n\n0:14:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Device fence.\n\n0:14:50\tSPEAKER_02\n And they think fence shooting too because of the titanium back.\n\n0:14:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:14:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Other enough technology.\n\n0:14:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, also we have two.\n\n0:14:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that's great.\n\n0:14:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Is the device easy to use?\n\n0:15:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, we have not many buttons.\n\n0:15:02\tSPEAKER_01\n So we have maybe two.\n\n0:15:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Wow.\n\n0:15:04\tSPEAKER_02\n So the voice recording.\n\n0:15:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Three.\n\n0:15:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Are the trends about fruit, in fact, the most implemented well in our coffers, in our fronts.\n\n0:15:11\tSPEAKER_02\n So yes, one.\n\n0:15:12\tSPEAKER_02\n One or two.\n\n0:15:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Is the material extra to four, I think.\n\n0:15:15\tSPEAKER_03\n If you look at this.\n\n0:15:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, it doesn't really resemble any fruit.\n\n0:15:19\tSPEAKER_01\n That's true.\n\n0:15:20\tSPEAKER_01\n But we have the...\n\n0:15:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Ah, fruit colors, of course.\n\n0:15:23\tSPEAKER_01\n And you can also have a front with the fruit.\n\n0:15:27\tSPEAKER_03\n It's the fruit that is very attractive.\n\n0:15:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, the titanium is strong and the rest...\n\n0:15:33\tSPEAKER_02\n The buttons feel soft, so I would say at least two.\n\n0:15:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:15:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:15:40\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:15:41\tSPEAKER_04\n This is the last meeting.\n\n0:15:43\tSPEAKER_04\n Yes.\n\n0:15:44\tSPEAKER_02\n But we have to design much more.\n\n0:15:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Because there was some irritating account manager coming to me.\n\n0:15:53\tSPEAKER_01\n I knew things were going smoothly.\n\n0:15:57\tSPEAKER_01\n It had to be some kind of trouble, a long way.\n\n0:16:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, look at the costs at this point.\n\n0:16:05\tSPEAKER_02\n My God, I had to fill it in.\n\n0:16:08\tSPEAKER_02\n It was to go through 12, right?\n\n0:16:10\tSPEAKER_02\n 12 and a half.\n\n0:16:11\tSPEAKER_02\n 12 and a half.\n\n0:16:12\tSPEAKER_02\n So, well, what costs a lot?\n\n0:16:15\tSPEAKER_02\n The sample speaker costs four.\n\n0:16:18\tSPEAKER_02\n What?\n\n0:16:19\tSPEAKER_02\n The sample speaker.\n\n0:16:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, that's easy.\n\n0:16:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Kick it out.\n\n0:16:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Kick it out.\n\n0:16:23\tSPEAKER_02\n We have to go to 12 and a half.\n\n0:16:24\tSPEAKER_02\n The speaker costs fair by far the most.\n\n0:16:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's a bit an optional option.\n\n0:16:31\tSPEAKER_02\n It isn't worth.\n\n0:16:32\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:16:33\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:16:34\tSPEAKER_02\n We could make two different versions, one with and one without.\n\n0:16:37\tSPEAKER_02\n It's just extra.\n\n0:16:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Kick it out.\n\n0:16:39\tSPEAKER_02\n So, zero.\n\n0:16:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Then we go to 14.6.\n\n0:16:45\tSPEAKER_02\n But more.\n\n0:16:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, the titanium I don't want to lose, actually.\n\n0:16:49\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:16:50\tSPEAKER_02\n LC3.\n\n0:16:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, hand dynamo.\n\n0:16:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Come on.\n\n0:16:54\tSPEAKER_01\n The remote control has a battery.\n\n0:16:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we have a bit of a problem, I think.\n\n0:16:59\tSPEAKER_04\n Why should we use an advanced chip?\n\n0:17:02\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, we've already had the LC3.\n\n0:17:04\tSPEAKER_04\n You had said.\n\n0:17:05\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:06\tSPEAKER_04\n Come to do it with a regular chip.\n\n0:17:08\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:17:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Why not?\n\n0:17:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Because that...\n\n0:17:12\tSPEAKER_01\n No, because...\n\n0:17:13\tSPEAKER_01\n What's the difference between a simple regular?\n\n0:17:16\tSPEAKER_02\n What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip?\n\n0:17:18\tSPEAKER_02\n A regular chip.\n\n0:17:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:20\tSPEAKER_02\n A simple?\n\n0:17:21\tSPEAKER_01\n A simple.\n\n0:17:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, yeah.\n\n0:17:23\tSPEAKER_01\n I read something about it, but...\n\n0:17:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Elementary.\n\n0:17:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, ties.\n\n0:17:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:28\tSPEAKER_01\n I read something about it, but it wasn't very clear.\n\n0:17:31\tSPEAKER_01\n I didn't include it in my report.\n\n0:17:33\tSPEAKER_02\n What happens if we do single...\n\n0:17:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, you have to use...\n\n0:17:38\tSPEAKER_01\n A chip, so...\n\n0:17:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, you have to use the advanced chip one.\n\n0:17:43\tSPEAKER_01\n We have to use the advanced chip one.\n\n0:17:44\tSPEAKER_01\n If you have the LC3.\n\n0:17:45\tSPEAKER_04\n We have very little options for the more.\n\n0:17:47\tSPEAKER_04\n But if you have a regular chip, you can't have the LC3.\n\n0:17:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we have to put the...\n\n0:17:52\tSPEAKER_03\n No, we need to have the...\n\n0:17:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, we could say...\n\n0:17:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, this special color...\n\n0:17:57\tSPEAKER_02\n That isn't there, because the fronts...\n\n0:18:00\tSPEAKER_02\n They will buy it.\n\n0:18:01\tSPEAKER_02\n This special color.\n\n0:18:02\tSPEAKER_02\n But that's only one half.\n\n0:18:04\tSPEAKER_03\n It doesn't...\n\n0:18:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Not relevant.\n\n0:18:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Then you only have one half left.\n\n0:18:08\tSPEAKER_04\n You must use the chip back in this.\n\n0:18:10\tSPEAKER_01\n But then we have to lose the LC3.\n\n0:18:14\tSPEAKER_03\n No.\n\n0:18:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Then the whole concept is...\n\n0:18:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I know.\n\n0:18:19\tSPEAKER_01\n That's what my information is.\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_01\n I didn't put the advanced chip in there for fun.\n\n0:18:25\tSPEAKER_03\n You can make a chip, but if you don't sell...\n\n0:18:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:30\tSPEAKER_04\n We have an advanced chip on print, and we have an LC3.\n\n0:18:33\tSPEAKER_04\n I think that's a bit double.\n\n0:18:35\tSPEAKER_04\n You don't need both.\n\n0:18:36\tSPEAKER_02\n The advanced chip is needed to have the LC3 in this play.\n\n0:18:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:18:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Says his...\n\n0:18:42\tSPEAKER_02\n There was in the second meeting, I think.\n\n0:18:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, what do they mean with curves?\n\n0:18:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Again, because you have...\n\n0:18:48\tSPEAKER_02\n I did single curves to...\n\n0:18:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, you said double curved.\n\n0:18:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:18:54\tSPEAKER_02\n He...\n\n0:18:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Because I thought it's a bit cheaper already.\n\n0:18:57\tSPEAKER_01\n We can also make it flat.\n\n0:18:59\tSPEAKER_01\n What do they mean with curves?\n\n0:19:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Is this curved?\n\n0:19:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, this curved?\n\n0:19:04\tSPEAKER_01\n One curved.\n\n0:19:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, this is actually two curved.\n\n0:19:06\tSPEAKER_01\n No, it's how you look at it.\n\n0:19:08\tSPEAKER_01\n One curved.\n\n0:19:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Simple.\n\n0:19:10\tSPEAKER_01\n But then we have a huge problem, I think.\n\n0:19:12\tSPEAKER_01\n We can never get below that...\n\n0:19:14\tSPEAKER_02\n We have a big financial problem.\n\n0:19:16\tSPEAKER_04\n We make it more expensive to buy.\n\n0:19:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, then we have two dollars less profit.\n\n0:19:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Come on.\n\n0:19:23\tSPEAKER_02\n If we make this 50 million, they won't test it to congratulate us.\n\n0:19:28\tSPEAKER_03\n If I make people brand-aware, they are willing to pay more.\n\n0:19:33\tSPEAKER_03\n But...\n\n0:19:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Because we use a brand at the front and at the back.\n\n0:19:39\tSPEAKER_03\n If you have lots of marketing, people might buy.\n\n0:19:45\tSPEAKER_04\n Or we could...\n\n0:19:46\tSPEAKER_02\n If you make it cool to have.\n\n0:19:48\tSPEAKER_02\n By the way, we also have this one.\n\n0:19:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, that's just great.\n\n0:19:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, cost nothing.\n\n0:19:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh.\n\n0:19:56\tSPEAKER_02\n That's nice.\n\n0:19:57\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:19:58\tSPEAKER_01\n I think you'll agree that we...\n\n0:20:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Now we have this screen.\n\n0:20:04\tSPEAKER_01\n It's very not practical to consider this after we have designed the entire thing.\n\n0:20:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, but I just got it.\n\n0:20:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, that's pretty...\n\n0:20:15\tSPEAKER_00\n That is pretty stupid.\n\n0:20:16\tSPEAKER_04\n That's pretty practical.\n\n0:20:18\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, Colant, titanium.\n\n0:20:21\tSPEAKER_04\n Who?\n\n0:20:22\tSPEAKER_04\n Titanium, Colant, plastic.\n\n0:20:26\tSPEAKER_02\n You want to jump to titanium?\n\n0:20:29\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, well, if we...\n\n0:20:31\tSPEAKER_04\n We have to get cheaper.\n\n0:20:33\tSPEAKER_02\n And make all plastic.\n\n0:20:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Then we're there.\n\n0:20:38\tSPEAKER_01\n But I don't agree.\n\n0:20:39\tSPEAKER_04\n I think we've got to...\n\n0:20:42\tSPEAKER_02\n If you look at the ugly...\n\n0:20:44\tSPEAKER_02\n The yellowish...\n\n0:20:45\tSPEAKER_02\n The ugly looking dumb...\n\n0:20:47\tSPEAKER_02\n We won't.\n\n0:20:48\tSPEAKER_02\n That no one would buy.\n\n0:20:49\tSPEAKER_04\n It's not ugly looking.\n\n0:20:50\tSPEAKER_04\n The looks remain the same.\n\n0:20:51\tSPEAKER_04\n No, I don't think so.\n\n0:20:53\tSPEAKER_01\n I think the titanium just provided the tough look and the...\n\n0:20:57\tSPEAKER_02\n And the feel and the fact that it is strong.\n\n0:20:59\tSPEAKER_01\n And also the older people will like it because of that.\n\n0:21:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Because it's not our target audience, but it's useful.\n\n0:21:06\tSPEAKER_01\n We still...\n\n0:21:07\tSPEAKER_02\n We have to put it to get more people from younger group, but not lose the one.\n\n0:21:12\tSPEAKER_01\n I think that the titanium is very important.\n\n0:21:14\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, all right.\n\n0:21:15\tSPEAKER_04\n But then we...\n\n0:21:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, we have a problem.\n\n0:21:17\tSPEAKER_01\n But you can better dump the LCD screen now.\n\n0:21:20\tSPEAKER_04\n You can dump the special color.\n\n0:21:21\tSPEAKER_04\n We use plastic.\n\n0:21:23\tSPEAKER_04\n The plastic is already in color.\n\n0:21:25\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't think you should dump the LCD screen.\n\n0:21:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, what else?\n\n0:21:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Nothing.\n\n0:21:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Or you should...\n\n0:21:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Or change the titanium or dump the LCD screen.\n\n0:21:35\tSPEAKER_03\n I think you could better change titanium to a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium.\n\n0:21:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Then lose the LCD screen.\n\n0:21:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Because you have lots of functions in it too.\n\n0:21:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, well, yeah.\n\n0:21:48\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:21:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Why can't I agree with that?\n\n0:21:50\tSPEAKER_01\n So we use...\n\n0:21:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Unfortunately.\n\n0:21:56\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll put it in the report.\n\n0:21:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Titanium Colored Plastic.\n\n0:21:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Titanium Colored Plastic.\n\n0:21:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Titanium Colored Plastic.\n\n0:22:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Titanium Colored Plastic.\n\n0:22:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Titanium Colored Plastic.\n\n0:22:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Titanium Colored Plastic.\n\n0:22:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Titanium Colored Plastic.\n\n0:22:04\tSPEAKER_01\n I agree.\n\n0:22:05\tSPEAKER_01\n So, titanium or colored plastic for the back?\n\n0:22:08\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll talk to the managers.\n\n0:22:09\tSPEAKER_02\n No, no, no, no.\n\n0:22:10\tSPEAKER_04\n Titanium stays there.\n\n0:22:11\tSPEAKER_04\n Titanium, I think.\n\n0:22:12\tSPEAKER_04\n I think this is...\n\n0:22:13\tSPEAKER_02\n This is...\n\n0:22:14\tSPEAKER_02\n This is...\n\n0:22:15\tSPEAKER_02\n This is really good.\n\n0:22:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, this is good.\n\n0:22:17\tSPEAKER_01\n But it's not bad enough.\n\n0:22:18\tSPEAKER_01\n So we have to use the...\n\n0:22:20\tSPEAKER_01\n ditch the titanium, I'm afraid.\n\n0:22:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Ah, those...\n\n0:22:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Those account managers.\n\n0:22:23\tSPEAKER_02\n What do they know?\n\n0:22:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Come on.\n\n0:22:25\tSPEAKER_02\n What do we know?\n\n0:22:26\tSPEAKER_02\n What do we know?\n\n0:22:27\tSPEAKER_02\n All we want is a fancy design.\n\n0:22:29\tSPEAKER_01\n But we don't really have to...\n\n0:22:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:22:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, yes.\n\n0:22:34\tSPEAKER_04\n No, because we didn't know anything about it.\n\n0:22:36\tSPEAKER_04\n If you don't have to make it,\n\n0:22:38\tSPEAKER_03\n we have to deal with it now. If you don't have the money, you can't make it.\n\n0:22:41\tSPEAKER_03\n So, this is too expensive.\n\n0:22:44\tSPEAKER_03\n So...\n\n0:22:46\tSPEAKER_01\n So, we have to make it cheaper.\n\n0:22:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Titanium gone and add plastic.\n\n0:22:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:22:50\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, but then we've got money...\n\n0:22:52\tSPEAKER_01\n An on plastic times two and then we are there.\n\n0:22:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, no, it's just on all plastic.\n\n0:22:56\tSPEAKER_02\n No, no, no, no.\n\n0:22:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Right, right, not yet.\n\n0:23:01\tSPEAKER_01\n That's a ghost niggas.\n\n0:23:03\tSPEAKER_01\n A lot of plastic, eh?\n\n0:23:05\tSPEAKER_01\n It's just free money.\n\n0:23:06\tSPEAKER_01\n So, now two for the two make it clear.\n\n0:23:08\tSPEAKER_02\n But then we can add the special color.\n\n0:23:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Because we have money left.\n\n0:23:14\tSPEAKER_02\n And we still have money left.\n\n0:23:16\tSPEAKER_02\n What do we want, guys?\n\n0:23:18\tSPEAKER_01\n I want gold plating.\n\n0:23:19\tSPEAKER_01\n No, not the head.\n\n0:23:20\tSPEAKER_01\n I want chrome.\n\n0:23:21\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, I think the case is double-curved, eh?\n\n0:23:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:23:24\tSPEAKER_02\n We have to...\n\n0:23:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, no!\n\n0:23:28\tSPEAKER_00\n All right.\n\n0:23:30\tSPEAKER_01\n No, no, no, but that's safe.\n\n0:23:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, you can double-curve if you don't have titanium.\n\n0:23:38\tSPEAKER_01\n And that we dropped.\n\n0:23:40\tSPEAKER_01\n So, it can be done.\n\n0:23:42\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:23:43\tSPEAKER_01\n But it's pretty funny.\n\n0:23:44\tSPEAKER_01\n We do want to reach 12.5.\n\n0:23:47\tSPEAKER_01\n But it's not too...\n\n0:23:48\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not too stale.\n\n0:23:49\tSPEAKER_01\n It's 11.\n\n0:23:50\tSPEAKER_04\n It's not too stale, but it looks like it.\n\n0:23:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we get our salaries, we make it nice.\n\n0:23:54\tSPEAKER_02\n We have to jump out of titanium.\n\n0:23:56\tSPEAKER_02\n And we'll hate the managers for that.\n\n0:23:58\tSPEAKER_02\n But now we're going to object...\n\n0:24:00\tSPEAKER_02\n We evaluate our project.\n\n0:24:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Project.\n\n0:24:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Project.\n\n0:24:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, satisfaction only for example, are we satisfactory about our creativity?\n\n0:24:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I can get no satisfaction, but, eh...\n\n0:24:15\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's, eh...\n\n0:24:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, and if we consider the cost, then this is the best, can.\n\n0:24:21\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's terrible that we got those costs at the last moment.\n\n0:24:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, me too.\n\n0:24:25\tSPEAKER_02\n That's really bad.\n\n0:24:26\tSPEAKER_02\n That's ridiculous.\n\n0:24:27\tSPEAKER_01\n That's...\n\n0:24:28\tSPEAKER_02\n That's...\n\n0:24:29\tSPEAKER_02\n But also for our creativity, we have a nice design.\n\n0:24:32\tSPEAKER_02\n And then you get the cost and you have to dump all your creativity.\n\n0:24:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, right.\n\n0:24:36\tSPEAKER_04\n We use our creativity, but we just have to adapt it to the cost.\n\n0:24:39\tSPEAKER_04\n Which is very practical, but...\n\n0:24:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:42\tSPEAKER_01\n That's the way...\n\n0:24:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, all right.\n\n0:24:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Leadership.\n\n0:24:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Terrible.\n\n0:24:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Teamwork.\n\n0:24:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Leadership.\n\n0:24:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, it's...\n\n0:24:52\tSPEAKER_03\n It was very democratic.\n\n0:24:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, well, I think so, so.\n\n0:24:55\tSPEAKER_02\n I feel that they need the questionaries each time, so...\n\n0:24:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:25:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, the managers were terrible.\n\n0:25:03\tSPEAKER_02\n So, with their all-door, useless requirements, but, all right.\n\n0:25:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Our teamwork.\n\n0:25:09\tSPEAKER_01\n They didn't think of the requirements.\n\n0:25:11\tSPEAKER_01\n It's the requirements of the user, I guess.\n\n0:25:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Now, they said, oh, we won't...\n\n0:25:15\tSPEAKER_02\n We won't...\n\n0:25:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:17\tSPEAKER_02\n We'll stay the text.\n\n0:25:18\tSPEAKER_02\n We won't use the DVD.\n\n0:25:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Now, but they base that on...\n\n0:25:21\tSPEAKER_01\n And user specifications.\n\n0:25:23\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:25:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Teamwork.\n\n0:25:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, great, I think.\n\n0:25:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Thanks for the...\n\n0:25:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, what do you think about the smartboard?\n\n0:25:30\tSPEAKER_01\n It was a complete disaster.\n\n0:25:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I like it.\n\n0:25:33\tSPEAKER_01\n That's a smartboard.\n\n0:25:34\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:35\tSPEAKER_04\n And that's a digital pen.\n\n0:25:36\tSPEAKER_04\n It's also a smartboard.\n\n0:25:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Now, it's part of a way around.\n\n0:25:38\tSPEAKER_01\n That's the smartboard.\n\n0:25:39\tSPEAKER_02\n I like this smartboard, but I hated that one.\n\n0:25:41\tSPEAKER_02\n This isn't a smartboard.\n\n0:25:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, it's both a smartboard.\n\n0:25:43\tSPEAKER_03\n That's a smartboard.\n\n0:25:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, all right.\n\n0:25:45\tSPEAKER_03\n But you...\n\n0:25:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, there's a large...\n\n0:25:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Large television.\n\n0:25:48\tSPEAKER_02\n You used a smartboard.\n\n0:25:49\tSPEAKER_02\n It's both a smartboard, but this one is used for a desktop.\n\n0:25:53\tSPEAKER_02\n And that one is used to draw.\n\n0:25:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but you can...\n\n0:25:55\tSPEAKER_03\n This is just a Bimmer function.\n\n0:25:57\tSPEAKER_03\n And here, on this one, you can draw pictures and things together.\n\n0:26:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, which one did you like?\n\n0:26:01\tSPEAKER_02\n That one.\n\n0:26:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Left or right?\n\n0:26:03\tSPEAKER_02\n That one.\n\n0:26:04\tSPEAKER_03\n That one is...\n\n0:26:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Actually, it just doesn't work.\n\n0:26:07\tSPEAKER_04\n I think this is meant by the digital pen.\n\n0:26:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:26:11\tSPEAKER_02\n That is, so.\n\n0:26:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I think that's a big smartboard.\n\n0:26:14\tSPEAKER_03\n I think that's a big smartboard.\n\n0:26:15\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't need a smartboard.\n\n0:26:17\tSPEAKER_04\n No, it's a smartboard.\n\n0:26:19\tSPEAKER_04\n No, well.\n\n0:26:20\tSPEAKER_04\n We use that one.\n\n0:26:21\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, but we need it.\n\n0:26:22\tSPEAKER_03\n It gives me a Bimmer.\n\n0:26:23\tSPEAKER_03\n That's a smartboard.\n\n0:26:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, much cheaper.\n\n0:26:25\tSPEAKER_02\n It's all left up to a Bimmer or have this one standing here in a...\n\n0:26:29\tSPEAKER_02\n I like it.\n\n0:26:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:26:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I like it.\n\n0:26:32\tSPEAKER_04\n I like it.\n\n0:26:33\tSPEAKER_01\n But you can...\n\n0:26:34\tSPEAKER_01\n I said it about three times now.\n\n0:26:36\tSPEAKER_01\n A green board with chalk is much more useful than that.\n\n0:26:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it is.\n\n0:26:41\tSPEAKER_02\n The simple school board.\n\n0:26:43\tSPEAKER_02\n And the digital pen.\n\n0:26:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Did you like that one?\n\n0:26:47\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:26:48\tSPEAKER_01\n I didn't use it.\n\n0:26:49\tSPEAKER_01\n I wrote things down, but I didn't...\n\n0:26:50\tSPEAKER_01\n I used it to check it out.\n\n0:26:51\tSPEAKER_02\n You just need to check it out.\n\n0:26:52\tSPEAKER_02\n But...\n\n0:26:53\tSPEAKER_02\n You can send that to anyone.\n\n0:26:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Because you just need to travel something on a page for yourself.\n\n0:26:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:26:58\tSPEAKER_02\n And then you're going to send it.\n\n0:26:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, well.\n\n0:27:00\tSPEAKER_01\n And then also, you write things now.\n\n0:27:02\tSPEAKER_01\n And you can also bring your note block.\n\n0:27:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:06\tSPEAKER_01\n What's the...\n\n0:27:07\tSPEAKER_01\n What's the point of importing it into?\n\n0:27:09\tSPEAKER_04\n I drew this.\n\n0:27:11\tSPEAKER_04\n I made a mistake, but it...\n\n0:27:13\tSPEAKER_04\n It would have been useful if I could show this on the screen.\n\n0:27:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, all right.\n\n0:27:17\tSPEAKER_01\n For drawing.\n\n0:27:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, for drawing.\n\n0:27:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, for drawing.\n\n0:27:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Not for personal notes, right?\n\n0:27:21\tSPEAKER_04\n I think that's not very...\n\n0:27:22\tSPEAKER_04\n Notes.\n\n0:27:23\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, you can bring your paper work along.\n\n0:27:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, of course, if you have a lot of paper drawings...\n\n0:27:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I agree on that.\n\n0:27:30\tSPEAKER_02\n But for notes, you have to put that in a strict...\n\n0:27:34\tSPEAKER_02\n You have to put in names, then the date.\n\n0:27:36\tSPEAKER_02\n And all those things, notes for a meeting are very strict.\n\n0:27:40\tSPEAKER_02\n So if you would write them down for yourself and then put that in your computer...\n\n0:27:45\tSPEAKER_02\n You still have to type it over to words.\n\n0:27:47\tSPEAKER_02\n So it doesn't have any...\n\n0:27:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Does that matter?\n\n0:27:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I understand.\n\n0:27:51\tSPEAKER_01\n But I think this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paper work.\n\n0:27:55\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not very...\n\n0:27:57\tSPEAKER_01\n No, I don't think so.\n\n0:27:58\tSPEAKER_01\n A lot of documents are...\n\n0:27:59\tSPEAKER_03\n It's only useful if you have to draw something.\n\n0:28:02\tSPEAKER_04\n But then it's really useful, I think.\n\n0:28:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:06\tSPEAKER_02\n
