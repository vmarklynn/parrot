the plate.\n\n0:00:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Good morning.\n\n0:00:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Good morning.\n\n0:00:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Should I bring my pen to?\n\n0:00:36\tSPEAKER_00\n No, that's for me.\n\n0:00:39\tSPEAKER_03\n I've got my mouse.\n\n0:00:44\tSPEAKER_01\n I do.\n\n0:00:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Come on.\n\n0:00:50\tSPEAKER_02\n There we are.\n\n0:00:58\tSPEAKER_03\n My laptop is crashing.\n\n0:01:05\tNone\n Damn, computer.\n\n0:01:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Help, help, help.\n\n0:01:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's just check one more time.\n\n0:01:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Can't hear me.\n\n0:01:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Actually, my laptop doesn't work.\n\n0:01:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Check.\n\n0:01:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:01:33\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it works.\n\n0:01:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Test, test.\n\n0:01:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, it's work.\n\n0:01:46\tSPEAKER_00\n So you're all right, what are we going to do or not?\n\n0:01:50\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm going to make a remote control.\n\n0:01:52\tSPEAKER_01\n I think my laptop is with etchy.\n\n0:01:59\tSPEAKER_00\n I just made a simple presentation.\n\n0:02:07\tSPEAKER_00\n We also put some things in it.\n\n0:02:20\tSPEAKER_00\n How does this work?\n\n0:02:23\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know.\n\n0:02:24\tSPEAKER_02\n One, I'll hold it right.\n\n0:02:27\tSPEAKER_03\n That's one.\n\n0:02:28\tSPEAKER_00\n That's half 11.\n\n0:02:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:02:31\tSPEAKER_00\n So that's my name.\n\n0:02:33\tSPEAKER_00\n We're going to make a remote control.\n\n0:02:36\tSPEAKER_00\n You already know that.\n\n0:02:38\tSPEAKER_00\n We have a look.\n\n0:02:39\tSPEAKER_00\n We're going to this agenda of our meeting.\n\n0:02:41\tSPEAKER_00\n You know this is about 25 minutes.\n\n0:02:43\tSPEAKER_00\n This meeting.\n\n0:02:46\tSPEAKER_00\n The first thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do.\n\n0:02:50\tSPEAKER_00\n We also read what these things are.\n\n0:02:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Not yet.\n\n0:02:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:02:55\tSPEAKER_00\n So it has to be original training user friendly.\n\n0:02:58\tSPEAKER_00\n That's where we're going to design.\n\n0:03:00\tSPEAKER_00\n First, we have three steps of making the remote control.\n\n0:03:05\tSPEAKER_00\n The first thing is the functional design.\n\n0:03:09\tSPEAKER_00\n It's very important.\n\n0:03:10\tSPEAKER_00\n We have to look what the needs are, the effects of the functional design.\n\n0:03:14\tSPEAKER_00\n And how the remote control works.\n\n0:03:18\tSPEAKER_00\n That's where we're going to look in the functional design.\n\n0:03:20\tSPEAKER_00\n That's for the next meeting.\n\n0:03:22\tSPEAKER_00\n The second thing is the conceptual design.\n\n0:03:25\tSPEAKER_00\n That's what the specifications of the components and properties.\n\n0:03:30\tSPEAKER_00\n And the specifications of the user interface.\n\n0:03:33\tSPEAKER_00\n We have to look what the market is doing for what kind of remote controls are in the market.\n\n0:03:40\tSPEAKER_00\n And the third thing is the detailed design.\n\n0:03:46\tSPEAKER_00\n And that's exactly what it is.\n\n0:03:48\tSPEAKER_00\n This is exactly how it looks.\n\n0:03:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:03:52\tSPEAKER_00\n So this is two smart boards.\n\n0:03:55\tSPEAKER_00\n There's an introduction of that one.\n\n0:04:00\tSPEAKER_00\n You already saw.\n\n0:04:01\tSPEAKER_00\n You know all that you can put things in the project map folder.\n\n0:04:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:04:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:04:13\tSPEAKER_00\n So now we have a look at that one.\n\n0:04:19\tSPEAKER_00\n So what we're going to do first is so you can read.\n\n0:04:27\tSPEAKER_00\n You have to draw a favorite animal on the white board.\n\n0:04:34\tSPEAKER_00\n And say, why is your favorite animal?\n\n0:04:37\tSPEAKER_00\n So, and you have to try it out.\n\n0:04:40\tSPEAKER_00\n And we have to use different pen colors and different thickness of the pen.\n\n0:04:47\tSPEAKER_00\n So first, to show you, maybe you can come here to have a look how it works.\n\n0:04:54\tSPEAKER_00\n You can see that.\n\n0:04:56\tSPEAKER_00\n This is a new page.\n\n0:04:57\tSPEAKER_00\n It's okay.\n\n0:04:59\tSPEAKER_00\n You spend format.\n\n0:05:05\tSPEAKER_00\n And a different color can use you.\n\n0:05:07\tSPEAKER_00\n And I just take pink.\n\n0:05:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Take, there's no pink.\n\n0:05:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:05:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Purple.\n\n0:05:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:05:17\tSPEAKER_00\n And line with ten.\n\n0:05:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:05:22\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll just take what I'm going to draw as an elephant.\n\n0:05:28\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll draw slowly because otherwise it won't work.\n\n0:05:35\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a very nice elephant.\n\n0:05:44\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:05:45\tSPEAKER_00\n It looks very nice.\n\n0:05:50\tSPEAKER_00\n And just how much is this?\n\n0:05:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, no.\n\n0:05:54\tSPEAKER_00\n It's like a dinosaur.\n\n0:05:59\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a pink elephant.\n\n0:06:08\tSPEAKER_00\n This takes you long.\n\n0:06:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:06:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Whatever.\n\n0:06:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Just erase this one.\n\n0:06:16\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a bit slow.\n\n0:06:17\tSPEAKER_00\n You can see this is a bit annoying.\n\n0:06:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:06:23\tSPEAKER_00\n So just for you guys, just one of you can draw a painting if you want.\n\n0:06:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Just round.\n\n0:06:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Don't, yeah, just use it like that.\n\n0:06:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:06:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Just say format.\n\n0:06:42\tSPEAKER_03\n You can use a pen.\n\n0:06:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:06:47\tSPEAKER_03\n And what's the color?\n\n0:06:48\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a format.\n\n0:06:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:06:54\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll take this one.\n\n0:06:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Just to be water.\n\n0:07:06\tSPEAKER_03\n No, it has to be an animal.\n\n0:07:09\tSPEAKER_00\n So if it should be a snake, it's an animal.\n\n0:07:13\tSPEAKER_03\n So I first draw the water.\n\n0:07:16\tSPEAKER_02\n The water is important.\n\n0:07:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:07:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Now I'll make the animal.\n\n0:07:36\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a fish.\n\n0:07:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Wow.\n\n0:07:44\tSPEAKER_02\n So.\n\n0:07:51\tSPEAKER_03\n And this is so verm.\n\n0:07:59\tNone\n Beautiful.\n\n0:08:02\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:03\tNone\n Wow.\n\n0:08:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:08:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Next.\n\n0:08:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Do you have to write down what you want?\n\n0:08:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Wow.\n\n0:08:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:08:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Next.\n\n0:08:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Do you have to write down why it doesn't matter.\n\n0:08:20\tSPEAKER_00\n It's to get used to the white part.\n\n0:08:22\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:08:23\tNone\n Just make a new blank page.\n\n0:08:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:08:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, Paul.\n\n0:08:43\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Like this.\n\n0:08:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, not too far to the pen.\n\n0:08:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:08:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's make it.\n\n0:09:03\tSPEAKER_02\n And dark.\n\n0:09:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:09:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back so that.\n\n0:09:32\tSPEAKER_01\n No, today.\n\n0:09:33\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:34\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it's a pig.\n\n0:09:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Pig?\n\n0:09:37\tSPEAKER_02\n No, it's a dog.\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_02\n No, it's a dog.\n\n0:09:42\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a sheep.\n\n0:09:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Not a hat.\n\n0:09:47\tSPEAKER_00\n We only have 25 minutes.\n\n0:09:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Take it easy.\n\n0:09:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, I'll make a cat of it.\n\n0:09:56\tSPEAKER_01\n I was going to make a cat too.\n\n0:09:59\tSPEAKER_00\n You should find this.\n\n0:10:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Not too quick.\n\n0:10:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Just hold it more to the back thing.\n\n0:10:09\tSPEAKER_02\n I just draw it too quick.\n\n0:10:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:10:13\tSPEAKER_02\n That's it.\n\n0:10:15\tSPEAKER_02\n More?\n\n0:10:16\tSPEAKER_00\n No, that's okay.\n\n0:10:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Thank you.\n\n0:10:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:10:40\tSPEAKER_00\n I thought these pens would be just.\n\n0:10:44\tSPEAKER_00\n You write it down and you don't know the two words.\n\n0:10:46\tSPEAKER_00\n You already did it or no?\n\n0:10:47\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:10:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n0:10:49\tSPEAKER_02\n You just...\n\n0:10:50\tSPEAKER_02\n You just got to write on this paper.\n\n0:10:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Sorry.\n\n0:10:53\tSPEAKER_02\n You really got to write on this paper?\n\n0:10:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I know.\n\n0:10:55\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a real pen.\n\n0:10:56\tSPEAKER_00\n I thought it would be just in the type of words.\n\n0:10:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it's just a picture.\n\n0:11:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh.\n\n0:11:02\tSPEAKER_00\n So, it's not that cool what I thought it would be.\n\n0:11:05\tSPEAKER_03\n You can't edit it in the words.\n\n0:11:07\tSPEAKER_03\n No.\n\n0:11:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh.\n\n0:11:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:11:16\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a donkey.\n\n0:11:26\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know what time did we start this meeting and not sure.\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it was...\n\n0:11:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Half past ten.\n\n0:11:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:11:42\tNone\n Brilliant.\n\n0:11:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:11:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Nice.\n\n0:11:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:52\tNone\n Thank you.\n\n0:11:53\tSPEAKER_00\n You have to save everything.\n\n0:11:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:12:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:12:16\tSPEAKER_00\n So, what we know is that we have to sell this remote control for about 25 euros.\n\n0:12:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:12:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:12:28\tSPEAKER_00\n And we have to make a profit of 50 million euros.\n\n0:12:31\tSPEAKER_00\n So, we have to use a big market in Europe.\n\n0:12:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Please.\n\n0:12:35\tSPEAKER_00\n The prediction costs about half the price is selling price.\n\n0:12:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Sorry.\n\n0:12:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Wow.\n\n0:12:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Easy.\n\n0:12:40\tSPEAKER_00\n So, can someone make a calculation about how many we have to sell these to make 50 million?\n\n0:12:46\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:12:47\tSPEAKER_00\n So, we're going to have a little discussion about what the experience are with the remote controller.\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_00\n So, we're going to have a little discussion about what the experience is and everything.\n\n0:12:57\tSPEAKER_00\n So, we just have a look.\n\n0:12:58\tSPEAKER_03\n We think about remote controls.\n\n0:13:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:01\tSPEAKER_03\n My first question was, does it have to be a universal remote control?\n\n0:13:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:13:06\tSPEAKER_03\n That's a good question.\n\n0:13:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Because we sell it only from the...\n\n0:13:12\tSPEAKER_03\n And not with the television.\n\n0:13:14\tSPEAKER_03\n We sell it apart.\n\n0:13:16\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's...\n\n0:13:17\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not sure.\n\n0:13:18\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not...\n\n0:13:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it probably would be universal.\n\n0:13:21\tSPEAKER_02\n And not only television or more devices.\n\n0:13:25\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't think you can buy a universal remote control for 25 years.\n\n0:13:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Not sure.\n\n0:13:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I know.\n\n0:13:33\tSPEAKER_03\n You can buy a universal control.\n\n0:13:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:13:37\tSPEAKER_00\n So, we just say it's a universal remote control.\n\n0:13:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:13:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Perfect.\n\n0:13:42\tSPEAKER_01\n And also for the FECR and DVD player.\n\n0:13:46\tSPEAKER_01\n And everything.\n\n0:13:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Just...\n\n0:13:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:13:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Buttons on that.\n\n0:13:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, probably.\n\n0:13:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Not just the TV.\n\n0:13:53\tSPEAKER_00\n No, just everything.\n\n0:13:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:13:55\tSPEAKER_00\n See you.\n\n0:13:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:13:57\tSPEAKER_00\n So, yeah, what's a remote control?\n\n0:13:59\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a black thing with some buttons on it.\n\n0:14:01\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not nothing very special.\n\n0:14:03\tSPEAKER_00\n But...\n\n0:14:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, we can try to make special.\n\n0:14:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:07\tSPEAKER_00\n So, do you have any ideas how it has to look for usability?\n\n0:14:11\tSPEAKER_03\n No, I've talked about making it the same as style as the television.\n\n0:14:16\tSPEAKER_03\n We don't have the same television all the time.\n\n0:14:20\tSPEAKER_03\n So, that's no matter.\n\n0:14:23\tSPEAKER_03\n If we control the FECR and DVD player player with it.\n\n0:14:32\tSPEAKER_03\n It has to be clear.\n\n0:14:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Because kits and elderly are going to use it.\n\n0:14:39\tSPEAKER_03\n So, it's not only for the technical persons.\n\n0:14:45\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it must be a very good control.\n\n0:14:52\tSPEAKER_03\n So, you can use it from everywhere in your room.\n\n0:14:58\tSPEAKER_03\n The infrared thing must be from very good quality.\n\n0:15:04\tSPEAKER_00\n That's right.\n\n0:15:05\tSPEAKER_00\n It should be a good point.\n\n0:15:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:15:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Nothing frustrated.\n\n0:15:10\tSPEAKER_01\n And how big should it be?\n\n0:15:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:13\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:15:16\tSPEAKER_02\n It shouldn't be too big.\n\n0:15:18\tSPEAKER_02\n But I don't think we can make it too small.\n\n0:15:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Because it has to have a lot of functions.\n\n0:15:24\tSPEAKER_02\n We can't make it smaller than things we know, I think.\n\n0:15:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Just big enough for the buttons we have.\n\n0:15:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Or we have to make something like mobile phones that you can fold it open.\n\n0:15:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe then you can make it smaller and you're weaker.\n\n0:15:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:15:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe more trendy.\n\n0:15:48\tSPEAKER_00\n You think about one you can fold open.\n\n0:15:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:15:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Or you can see more options.\n\n0:15:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe for the DVD player or something.\n\n0:15:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Or you can just generate general things like volume and TV channels.\n\n0:16:02\tSPEAKER_02\n And inside things you don't use that often.\n\n0:16:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Or you could think of a small touchscreen on the remote control.\n\n0:16:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Why should you use a touchscreen on the remote control?\n\n0:16:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe it's making a menu in it.\n\n0:16:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Or maybe to keep it easy and small.\n\n0:16:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:16:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:29\tSPEAKER_01\n I can't have to put a touchscreen on it.\n\n0:16:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe it would be a bit...\n\n0:16:33\tSPEAKER_03\n It's not reachable, I think.\n\n0:16:34\tSPEAKER_03\n And we have to care for the strength of the remote control.\n\n0:16:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Because remote controls are most things in the house that falls down on the ground and get often broken.\n\n0:16:47\tSPEAKER_00\n And if you have a touchscreen in it, it's definitely too much fun.\n\n0:16:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Lots of kits use it and touchscreen is not kits.\n\n0:16:56\tSPEAKER_03\n You can put games on your remote control.\n\n0:16:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:17:00\tSPEAKER_03\n And how about the batteries?\n\n0:17:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Should you put it in a rechargeer or...\n\n0:17:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, maybe not to good at it.\n\n0:17:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Just put it on your television and just recharge.\n\n0:17:11\tSPEAKER_00\n You never have to use any batteries.\n\n0:17:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe not to good at it.\n\n0:17:15\tSPEAKER_02\n But we have to look at the price and I think...\n\n0:17:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:18\tSPEAKER_02\n How expensive is a normal rechargeer?\n\n0:17:20\tSPEAKER_02\n How much is your standard mobile phone rechargeer?\n\n0:17:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:27\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a bit separately from your phone.\n\n0:17:30\tSPEAKER_01\n It's probably expensive, but I don't know what the production costs are.\n\n0:17:35\tSPEAKER_00\n If you look at the market, it's probably still the best way to just put batteries in it.\n\n0:17:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Because the home station is a really good idea because lots of people are lose their remote control.\n\n0:17:49\tSPEAKER_03\n And they don't know where it is.\n\n0:17:50\tSPEAKER_03\n And now they can put it always at the same place.\n\n0:17:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe it's...therefore it's a good idea, but maybe it's expensive.\n\n0:17:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe use it as a separate option.\n\n0:18:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Sell it separately.\n\n0:18:02\tSPEAKER_03\n You can buy it with...\n\n0:18:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but I have a mouse that's also...\n\n0:18:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Chargable?\n\n0:18:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:10\tSPEAKER_01\n And you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in a station.\n\n0:18:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Or you can change your batteries.\n\n0:18:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:17\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:18:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Option, just the option.\n\n0:18:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:20\tSPEAKER_03\n And then you can set something on paper already.\n\n0:18:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Size, looks, usable.\n\n0:18:25\tSPEAKER_03\n The buttons on usual places.\n\n0:18:27\tSPEAKER_03\n The arm of button must be on top.\n\n0:18:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:31\tSPEAKER_03\n It has to lay good in the hand.\n\n0:18:33\tSPEAKER_03\n You have to...\n\n0:18:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Has it be...does it has to be...have to be...like...\n\n0:18:39\tSPEAKER_00\n A different form than a normal remote controller.\n\n0:18:42\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know if we think we have to look at that.\n\n0:18:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, you can do everything in a distant way, but...\n\n0:18:48\tSPEAKER_03\n You can make it very special to create our own.\n\n0:18:51\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Looks, but it's very hard to...\n\n0:18:54\tSPEAKER_01\n If we want to make it special, we probably have to do a lot of testing if it really works.\n\n0:19:00\tSPEAKER_02\n No, you can...\n\n0:19:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Have the basic things on the same place.\n\n0:19:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Like on off-button on top and the TV channels, one, two, three, four, as a block.\n\n0:19:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:14\tSPEAKER_02\n And then the volume, obviously, on top, so you can see.\n\n0:19:17\tSPEAKER_02\n But the rest is...\n\n0:19:19\tSPEAKER_02\n You don't use that often, so...\n\n0:19:21\tSPEAKER_02\n If you have a clear button with a good icon on it, it should be clear as well.\n\n0:19:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:27\tSPEAKER_02\n So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control, I think.\n\n0:19:31\tSPEAKER_02\n So you can do something unique with that.\n\n0:19:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, and what we have to think about too is a button that you use often are...\n\n0:19:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe...\n\n0:19:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Like when you fall it open, when you have it closed, you can still do the functions.\n\n0:19:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, or top-order.\n\n0:19:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but the basic options on top.\n\n0:19:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Basically, when I'm watching TV, I'm just using five buttons.\n\n0:19:59\tSPEAKER_00\n So...\n\n0:20:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe it's very hard to make it full open and to look like it's very...\n\n0:20:06\tSPEAKER_00\n What's it called?\n\n0:20:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Very nice.\n\n0:20:09\tSPEAKER_03\n If you make it full open, it's also...\n\n0:20:12\tSPEAKER_03\n The strength is not as good as a remote control.\n\n0:20:15\tSPEAKER_00\n So maybe you have to keep it like a square, just normal remote control.\n\n0:20:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, but yeah.\n\n0:20:23\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we have to close this to finish this meeting.\n\n0:20:28\tSPEAKER_00\n There's some more things.\n\n0:20:31\tSPEAKER_00\n We have another 30 minutes, so then we're going to meet again.\n\n0:20:36\tSPEAKER_00\n So you know what you have to do?\n\n0:20:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:20:42\tSPEAKER_03\n For me, the marketing expert, the user requirements specification, do I need to think as a user, only the looks and what you want to do with it?\n\n0:20:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I think if you have to know if it's for TV, DVD player, all the things.\n\n0:21:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Also from a user, but...\n\n0:21:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, there's also about strength.\n\n0:21:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Everything.\n\n0:21:05\tSPEAKER_00\n So everything you want.\n\n0:21:07\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not strength, that's something for...\n\n0:21:12\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not for you.\n\n0:21:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:21:15\tSPEAKER_00\n What's in the market, what's normal, what kind of...\n\n0:21:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you want to do a remote control?\n\n0:21:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you need any young remote control?\n\n0:21:21\tSPEAKER_02\n I already wrote some down.\n\n0:21:24\tSPEAKER_03\n So what is?\n\n0:21:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Yep.\n\n0:21:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, just...\n\n0:21:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Is that okay?\n\n0:21:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:21:29\tSPEAKER_02\n There's already a document in the folder.\n\n0:21:34\tSPEAKER_03\n So you can see me too.\n\n0:21:38\tSPEAKER_00\n So see you in 30 minutes.\n\n0:21:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:21:42\tSPEAKER_00\n For the next time you have to put it exactly on the square.\n\n0:21:46\tSPEAKER_00\n You're left on.\n\n0:21:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, Paul.\n\n0:21:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Didn't say that.\n\n0:21:53\tSPEAKER_02\n No, sorry.\n\n0:21:54\tSPEAKER_02\n You're off of...\n\n0:21:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Ciao.\n\n0:22:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Bye bye.\n\n0:22:09\tNone\n Okay.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "SPEAKER and his
