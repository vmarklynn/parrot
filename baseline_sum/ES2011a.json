You can call me Abby.\n\n0:00:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's see.\n\n0:00:47\tSPEAKER_02\n PowerPoint.\n\n0:00:48\tSPEAKER_02\n That's not it.\n\n0:00:49\tSPEAKER_02\n There we go.\n\n0:00:50\tSPEAKER_02\n So this is our kickoff meeting.\n\n0:00:58\tSPEAKER_02\n I guess we should all get acquainted.\n\n0:01:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Should we all introduce ourselves?\n\n0:01:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Hi, I'm Kyara and the marketing expert.\n\n0:01:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment?\n\n0:01:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about it?\n\n0:01:17\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we'll get a man to that.\n\n0:01:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Just introduction.\n\n0:01:20\tSPEAKER_00\n My name is Kyara and I'm the marketing expert.\n\n0:01:23\tSPEAKER_02\n I forgot to say I'm the project manager, but I figured you all need that already.\n\n0:01:28\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm Stephanie and I am the user interface designer.\n\n0:01:33\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm Krista and I'm the industrial designer.\n\n0:01:38\tSPEAKER_02\n So here's our agenda for today.\n\n0:01:42\tSPEAKER_02\n We're going to do some tool training, project plan, and discuss my enclosed.\n\n0:01:56\tSPEAKER_02\n So our aim is to produce remote control that is original, trendy, and user-friendly.\n\n0:02:04\tSPEAKER_02\n And to do this, we have to...\n\n0:02:07\tSPEAKER_02\n There are certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing.\n\n0:02:16\tSPEAKER_02\n So...\n\n0:02:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, there it is.\n\n0:02:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:02:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design.\n\n0:02:24\tSPEAKER_02\n So throughout our next couple of meetings, we'll be covering these things.\n\n0:02:32\tSPEAKER_02\n So we're going to try out our whiteboard.\n\n0:02:35\tNone\n If...\n\n0:02:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, all draw our favorite animal to sum up the characteristics of that animal.\n\n0:02:46\tSPEAKER_01\n So you want us to draw it and then talk about it or just draw it.\n\n0:02:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, both of those.\n\n0:02:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Those thoughts?\n\n0:02:55\tSPEAKER_00\n You have to decide to start some of that.\n\n0:03:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Any volunteers?\n\n0:03:01\tSPEAKER_02\n They wouldn't know what they want to draw.\n\n0:03:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I think about it.\n\n0:03:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Just a second.\n\n0:03:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Does it have to be functional, trendy, and user-friendly?\n\n0:03:14\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't think so.\n\n0:03:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, I'll draw.\n\n0:03:20\tSPEAKER_01\n I'll draw them.\n\n0:03:22\tSPEAKER_01\n I'll draw them.\n\n0:03:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, my favorite animal is...\n\n0:04:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Oops.\n\n0:04:21\tSPEAKER_02\n A dolphin.\n\n0:04:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes!\n\n0:04:27\tSPEAKER_02\n It's like playing fiction, eh?\n\n0:04:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I guess it has a thing on top, too.\n\n0:04:36\tSPEAKER_02\n It's my dolphin.\n\n0:04:40\tSPEAKER_02\n So what characteristics do you like about your animal?\n\n0:04:43\tSPEAKER_01\n I like its tail.\n\n0:04:45\tSPEAKER_01\n I think dolphins are really...\n\n0:04:49\tSPEAKER_01\n...another smart and they're cute.\n\n0:04:54\tSPEAKER_01\n And they like swimming.\n\n0:04:57\tSPEAKER_01\n That's cool.\n\n0:04:58\tSPEAKER_01\n They're graceful.\n\n0:04:59\tSPEAKER_01\n They're graceful, yeah.\n\n0:05:00\tSPEAKER_01\n And they're so...\n\n0:05:02\tSPEAKER_01\n...sleep.\n\n0:05:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, they're sleeping.\n\n0:05:04\tSPEAKER_01\n They're so diligent.\n\n0:05:06\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:05:07\tSPEAKER_01\n I guess it's a little like binocular.\n\n0:05:09\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know how intelligent that one looks.\n\n0:05:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, he doesn't look that smart.\n\n0:05:15\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:05:18\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's cool the interaction that...\n\n0:05:22\tSPEAKER_01\n...are the things that the reasons people seem to like...\n\n0:05:26\tSPEAKER_01\n...you know, people are sitting on the beach and...\n\n0:05:29\tSPEAKER_01\n...they're like, oh, look, there's dolphins.\n\n0:05:31\tSPEAKER_01\n But they're, you know, they jump around in the water and they're happy.\n\n0:05:34\tSPEAKER_01\n And...\n\n0:05:37\tSPEAKER_01\n...they're mammals.\n\n0:05:38\tSPEAKER_01\n But they swim.\n\n0:05:40\tSPEAKER_02\n They try.\n\n0:05:41\tSPEAKER_02\n So nobody else wants to draw their animal.\n\n0:05:45\tSPEAKER_01\n I suppose I can draw an animal.\n\n0:06:15\tSPEAKER_02\n No, there goes the 10.\n\n0:06:18\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a cat.\n\n0:06:25\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:06:26\tSPEAKER_01\n They sleep all day.\n\n0:06:27\tSPEAKER_01\n It's easy to draw.\n\n0:06:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you want to...\n\n0:06:35\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know.\n\n0:06:36\tSPEAKER_00\n I have a cat as well.\n\n0:06:37\tSPEAKER_00\n But I've got to spy one.\n\n0:06:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:06:41\tSPEAKER_00\n I use it spy one.\n\n0:06:44\tSPEAKER_00\n But it's harder to draw.\n\n0:06:47\tSPEAKER_00\n And the pen's running.\n\n0:06:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Of course.\n\n0:06:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Of course.\n\n0:07:01\tSPEAKER_00\n That's very nice.\n\n0:07:02\tSPEAKER_00\n But anyway, we'll do that.\n\n0:07:06\tSPEAKER_00\n And the main reason is that pretty.\n\n0:07:09\tSPEAKER_00\n I think they're very pretty.\n\n0:07:10\tSPEAKER_00\n And they go well with the environment.\n\n0:07:12\tSPEAKER_00\n And I like the way they run.\n\n0:07:14\tSPEAKER_00\n And I used to do horse riding.\n\n0:07:15\tSPEAKER_00\n And they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals.\n\n0:07:19\tSPEAKER_00\n And I like the way they feel sort of under.\n\n0:07:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Under the arm.\n\n0:07:26\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that's pretty much it.\n\n0:07:29\tSPEAKER_02\n A bit bit.\n\n0:07:38\tSPEAKER_02\n I think they're very nice courts.\n\n0:07:45\tSPEAKER_02\n I actually haven't thought of anything yet.\n\n0:07:51\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a pig.\n\n0:08:07\tSPEAKER_02\n So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's what a resistant, strong and furry.\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_02\n What do you think?\n\n0:08:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:20\tNone\n And furry?\n\n0:08:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, like a cat.\n\n0:08:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Textile.\n\n0:08:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Textile.\n\n0:08:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Textile.\n\n0:08:27\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm not sure.\n\n0:08:28\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm just putting it there.\n\n0:08:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:08:33\tSPEAKER_01\n You're dragging it.\n\n0:08:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh my gosh.\n\n0:08:37\tSPEAKER_02\n This is disastrous.\n\n0:08:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Sorry about that.\n\n0:08:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:08:42\tSPEAKER_02\n So moving on.\n\n0:08:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Our selling price goal is 25 euro.\n\n0:08:52\tSPEAKER_02\n And profit aim is 50 million euro.\n\n0:08:56\tSPEAKER_02\n So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland or in some European country.\n\n0:09:07\tSPEAKER_02\n And we hope to sell this internationally.\n\n0:09:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Sorry.\n\n0:09:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Can you just say that what are our price goals again?\n\n0:09:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Selling price is 25 euro.\n\n0:09:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Profit aim.\n\n0:09:19\tSPEAKER_02\n 50 million euro.\n\n0:09:27\tSPEAKER_00\n How many should we sell them?\n\n0:09:30\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:09:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Any one of math petition?\n\n0:09:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Two.\n\n0:09:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Two.\n\n0:09:34\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:09:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Two.\n\n0:09:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Four million.\n\n0:09:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Two million.\n\n0:09:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Four million.\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_00\n And well, it's a profit.\n\n0:09:41\tSPEAKER_00\n So the profit for each is 12.\n\n0:09:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh yeah.\n\n0:09:45\tSPEAKER_00\n I will do four million.\n\n0:09:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:09:57\tSPEAKER_00\n This is a thought.\n\n0:09:58\tSPEAKER_02\n So that's a 50%.\n\n0:10:15\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make this slideshow.\n\n0:10:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Experience with remote control.\n\n0:10:27\tSPEAKER_02\n So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide.\n\n0:10:32\tSPEAKER_02\n But we would like to see a convenient practical nice remote control.\n\n0:10:42\tSPEAKER_02\n So do we have any initial ideas for how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the buttons that you have?\n\n0:10:54\tSPEAKER_00\n I think one thing is that it should be easy to find.\n\n0:10:57\tSPEAKER_00\n I was thinking that too.\n\n0:10:59\tSPEAKER_01\n I think we should design something that has like a, so you can somehow like, I mean, you always know where your TV is.\n\n0:11:05\tSPEAKER_01\n So you should have a call button.\n\n0:11:06\tSPEAKER_01\n I've always wanted that.\n\n0:11:07\tSPEAKER_01\n You can push a button.\n\n0:11:08\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, you have it for the portable phone.\n\n0:11:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:11\tSPEAKER_01\n So you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control.\n\n0:11:15\tSPEAKER_00\n And even I think a little light.\n\n0:11:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Or even a maybe a vibrating thing.\n\n0:11:22\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know, but because it's usually under the sofa.\n\n0:11:26\tSPEAKER_00\n In which case you're going to be lit.\n\n0:11:28\tSPEAKER_00\n But if it has a sort of signal, which isn't on the sun, I don't know.\n\n0:11:32\tSPEAKER_00\n It's expensive.\n\n0:11:33\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't, yeah.\n\n0:11:34\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, it may be cool is enough.\n\n0:11:36\tSPEAKER_01\n But like, I mean, just, I mean, like your phone even just has sound like it can vibrate.\n\n0:11:41\tSPEAKER_01\n It can light up and like noise and I don't know.\n\n0:11:45\tSPEAKER_02\n What have I had something like, just like a magnet on the back of it.\n\n0:11:57\tSPEAKER_02\n And you could, I mean, just to have some place to put it besides like a base, you know, like a portable phone has a base.\n\n0:12:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Like just to have a home port.\n\n0:12:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Because people just stick it on top of their TV.\n\n0:12:14\tSPEAKER_02\n But the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the TV.\n\n0:12:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:18\tSPEAKER_01\n That's why it's always in the couch.\n\n0:12:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:20\tSPEAKER_01\n In the couch.\n\n0:12:21\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:12:22\tSPEAKER_01\n It seems like though that that would be hard because you're not going to be lazy anyway.\n\n0:12:26\tSPEAKER_02\n And we should design couches that have the remote control.\n\n0:12:29\tSPEAKER_01\n And the project just now catches it.\n\n0:12:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Even just to think to attach it to the, you know, if you had a thing, a pretty object to attach to the wall, but that would make it more expensive.\n\n0:12:39\tSPEAKER_00\n But it's only a plastic thing.\n\n0:12:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_00\n And then something like that.\n\n0:12:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose, or something like that?\n\n0:12:50\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not, well, it needs to be sort of handed.\n\n0:12:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Hand.\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Hand-sized.\n\n0:12:55\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't think you need that.\n\n0:12:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Not, not huge, but.\n\n0:12:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Definitely not.\n\n0:12:59\tSPEAKER_01\n It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it.\n\n0:13:04\tSPEAKER_01\n No, it really can be.\n\n0:13:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Or like a light thing, you know.\n\n0:13:08\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:13:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Space ship.\n\n0:13:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Or make it mobile so it runs around.\n\n0:13:13\tSPEAKER_01\n It comes.\n\n0:13:14\tSPEAKER_01\n It comes.\n\n0:13:15\tSPEAKER_01\n I can't find you.\n\n0:13:16\tSPEAKER_01\n That would be really.\n\n0:13:18\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm sure we could do that for $25.\n\n0:13:20\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:13:21\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean the bass.\n\n0:13:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:13:23\tSPEAKER_02\n So what do we think this remote control should?\n\n0:13:30\tNone\n Five minutes.\n\n0:13:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's see what we have left.\n\n0:13:38\tSPEAKER_01\n I also think though that I shouldn't have too many buttons.\n\n0:13:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Because I hate that one.\n\n0:13:42\tSPEAKER_00\n I have too many buttons.\n\n0:13:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:44\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, I know it has to have not many functions, but like.\n\n0:13:47\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:13:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Just have like 8,000 buttons.\n\n0:13:49\tSPEAKER_01\n And you're like, no, you never use half the time.\n\n0:13:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:53\tSPEAKER_02\n What if, um, it might be a little fancy, but what if it had like a little screen?\n\n0:13:57\tSPEAKER_02\n So it has less buttons, but it still has all the functions.\n\n0:14:00\tSPEAKER_02\n That would be cool.\n\n0:14:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Like the way mobile phone does.\n\n0:14:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:04\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, it just seems like.\n\n0:14:05\tSPEAKER_02\n So you could like, um, like if you have, I don't know if you have satellite, if you have a hundred channels, you can, the way you do on your radio, that you, what do you call it?\n\n0:14:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but you can program.\n\n0:14:16\tSPEAKER_02\n So you can program like your favorite channels.\n\n0:14:19\tSPEAKER_02\n So like if you had a.\n\n0:14:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Would you have the screen on the thing or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen?\n\n0:14:26\tSPEAKER_02\n That's something we could decide.\n\n0:14:28\tSPEAKER_01\n I guess they would go together somehow.\n\n0:14:30\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:14:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Because I don't know if it's expensive.\n\n0:14:35\tSPEAKER_00\n If you have, if you use the telly screen, because the telly is already a screen, then you can sort of have a programming function really easy, sort of arrow up and down on the remote and then use the telly as a screen.\n\n0:14:48\tSPEAKER_00\n But, um, I think it's a show.\n\n0:14:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Something like not, it's not on the bottom, but it's telling you what to do.\n\n0:14:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Is that what you mean?\n\n0:14:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:00\tSPEAKER_01\n You see those, you know, people, I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those these things at their house, you know, their entire house is so electronic.\n\n0:15:11\tSPEAKER_01\n And they have like this one master control that and it's like a handheld like turned on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like.\n\n0:15:19\tSPEAKER_01\n So I think it should be possible to have some kind of screen.\n\n0:15:23\tSPEAKER_01\n It must be, it would probably, it must be too expensive though.\n\n0:15:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Like mobile phones have screen.\n\n0:15:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n0:15:31\tSPEAKER_02\n And we have to remember budget is 12, 1250 for to actually make the device.\n\n0:15:41\tSPEAKER_02\n That's something that we have to see how much that would be.\n\n0:15:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, some, we can find out.\n\n0:15:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:15:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, the other thing you said that thing about robust and water, water resistance.\n\n0:16:03\tSPEAKER_00\n But it I thought, ah, spot on.\n\n0:16:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Good feel, tactile, tactile, tactile feel.\n\n0:16:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe something that doesn't make your hands sweat, not.\n\n0:16:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:15\tSPEAKER_00\n That's quite annoying.\n\n0:16:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, just like a simple thing to have a clip on it.\n\n0:16:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Like, see who clip it to you.\n\n0:16:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Like that's another.\n\n0:16:29\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:32\tSPEAKER_02\n We should probably start wrapping up.\n\n0:16:41\tSPEAKER_02\n We've got some initial ideas that we can all look into.\n\n0:16:46\tSPEAKER_02\n And come up with some new ones for the next meeting, which will be in over the 30 minutes.\n\n0:16:54\tSPEAKER_02\n So, yeah, the industrial design, what is it?\n\n0:17:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:03\tSPEAKER_02\n It's going to be looking more into the working design.\n\n0:17:06\tSPEAKER_02\n So I guess you'd be looking at about some of the things you discussed about screen.\n\n0:17:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Um, that sort of thing.\n\n0:17:17\tSPEAKER_01\n What is the UI?\n\n0:17:18\tSPEAKER_02\n That's me.\n\n0:17:19\tSPEAKER_02\n What is it, Sam?\n\n0:17:20\tSPEAKER_02\n We're going to use our interface
