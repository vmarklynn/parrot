Which is 0 based or 1 based?\n\n0:00:25\tSPEAKER_01\n So, that's that.\n\n0:00:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, so we're not going to do that.\n\n0:00:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:00:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Mic number 2.\n\n0:00:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Mic number 2.\n\n0:00:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Mic number 2.\n\n0:00:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Off by 1.\n\n0:00:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Mic number 2.\n\n0:00:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, that's why I wanted to write it down.\n\n0:00:42\tSPEAKER_01\n But, Dan just doesn't want to do that.\n\n0:00:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, you write it down.\n\n0:00:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Thank you.\n\n0:00:48\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm going to be like.\n\n0:00:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, no, no.\n\n0:00:50\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm going to be like.\n\n0:00:52\tSPEAKER_00\n That's not what you're done though.\n\n0:00:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Because you want to start the meeting.\n\n0:00:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, now, that means if I'm going to be standing in there looking, then someone else has to write them down.\n\n0:01:03\tSPEAKER_02\n The other thing is that, I mean, every time you move your head around, it gets probably the best of choice.\n\n0:01:09\tSPEAKER_01\n I like this.\n\n0:01:10\tSPEAKER_01\n It's easy.\n\n0:01:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Testing.\n\n0:01:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, it's great.\n\n0:01:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Adjust.\n\n0:01:15\tSPEAKER_00\n I want number 4.\n\n0:01:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Do we have the numbers that she's having a problem with?\n\n0:01:21\tSPEAKER_01\n So we're going to get them there in the folder right there.\n\n0:01:24\tSPEAKER_01\n You may.\n\n0:01:26\tSPEAKER_01\n So, Jane, can you talk into your mic?\n\n0:01:28\tSPEAKER_00\n You said it's mic 4.\n\n0:01:30\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm on mic 4.\n\n0:01:32\tSPEAKER_00\n And it's a very nice microphone.\n\n0:01:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Very modern.\n\n0:01:35\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm glad you liked it.\n\n0:01:36\tSPEAKER_00\n I like it very much.\n\n0:01:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Let's see, Eric, what mic are you?\n\n0:01:40\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm on channel 1.\n\n0:01:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Mic 1.\n\n0:01:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Channel 0, probably.\n\n0:01:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Looks like it's talking again.\n\n0:01:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Channel 0.\n\n0:01:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Thank you.\n\n0:01:51\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm on mic 3.\n\n0:01:53\tSPEAKER_02\n This is mic 3 coming in here.\n\n0:01:55\tSPEAKER_02\n It's moving around as I move my head back and forward.\n\n0:01:57\tSPEAKER_02\n So that's just the right guys.\n\n0:01:59\tSPEAKER_02\n That's life.\n\n0:02:00\tSPEAKER_02\n That's just what it does.\n\n0:02:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:02:03\tSPEAKER_00\n You didn't get this head restraint for the system?\n\n0:02:05\tSPEAKER_00\n That's right.\n\n0:02:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Head restraint.\n\n0:02:07\tSPEAKER_00\n I didn't modify my mic distance from my speaking apparatus.\n\n0:02:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Can you do taps on the PDAs and the PCMs?\n\n0:02:17\tSPEAKER_01\n And you have to actually check with the PCMs or not the PCMs?\n\n0:02:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Let's start with the PCMs.\n\n0:02:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Because this is PCM number 3.\n\n0:02:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Thank you.\n\n0:02:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's do an order.\n\n0:02:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:02:29\tSPEAKER_02\n PCM number 3 with the furthest away.\n\n0:02:31\tSPEAKER_02\n This is the next one, which is PCM number 4.\n\n0:02:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Apparently.\n\n0:02:35\tSPEAKER_02\n I can't tell.\n\n0:02:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Can you see other stuff happening?\n\n0:02:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Yep.\n\n0:02:40\tSPEAKER_02\n This is PCM number 4.\n\n0:02:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Thanks.\n\n0:02:43\tSPEAKER_03\n That's good.\n\n0:02:44\tSPEAKER_03\n This is PCM 2.\n\n0:02:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Thank you.\n\n0:02:50\tSPEAKER_03\n This is PCM 1.\n\n0:02:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Which is closest to the machine room.\n\n0:02:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Should I draw a mic?\n\n0:02:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:02:58\tSPEAKER_01\n And PDA left right.\n\n0:03:00\tSPEAKER_02\n This is one side of PDA.\n\n0:03:03\tSPEAKER_02\n We can actually give the side names, right?\n\n0:03:05\tSPEAKER_02\n This would be left, wouldn't it?\n\n0:03:07\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll see anything.\n\n0:03:08\tSPEAKER_02\n I know.\n\n0:03:09\tSPEAKER_02\n But I'm just asking.\n\n0:03:10\tSPEAKER_00\n You're labeling right now.\n\n0:03:11\tSPEAKER_02\n This is PDA left.\n\n0:03:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Are you getting something there?\n\n0:03:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Yep.\n\n0:03:16\tSPEAKER_02\n This is PDA right.\n\n0:03:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:03:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Thank you.\n\n0:03:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Very impugent.\n\n0:03:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:03:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Because it depends which one of these.\n\n0:03:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Did we just record all that?\n\n0:03:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Should we start it over?\n\n0:03:26\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:03:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:03:28\tSPEAKER_02\n So we had a game now.\n\n0:03:30\tSPEAKER_02\n We've built in down something.\n\n0:03:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:03:33\tSPEAKER_02\n What did we have?\n\n0:03:34\tSPEAKER_02\n We've built in down something.\n\n0:03:35\tSPEAKER_02\n So it's any recording.\n\n0:03:36\tSPEAKER_02\n 16kth time we've got it.\n\n0:03:37\tSPEAKER_02\n What do you say?\n\n0:03:38\tSPEAKER_02\n We're not recording.\n\n0:03:39\tSPEAKER_01\n The ones that aren't filled out are the ones you want to hand out.\n\n0:03:42\tSPEAKER_02\n What about the ones we should do?\n\n0:03:43\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:03:44\tSPEAKER_01\n I was looking through the window.\n\n0:03:45\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm just wondering if we could just hand out that.\n\n0:03:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:03:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:03:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Well then, fine.\n\n0:03:51\tSPEAKER_02\n See if we care.\n\n0:03:52\tSPEAKER_02\n You're probably wondering why I brought you all here today.\n\n0:03:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:03:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Before we.\n\n0:03:59\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:04:00\tSPEAKER_03\n So the first task is to read some digits.\n\n0:04:03\tSPEAKER_01\n So I'll go ahead and start.\n\n0:04:05\tSPEAKER_01\n And this is Adam on mic number 2.\n\n0:04:08\tSPEAKER_01\n And I'm reading transcript 111-130.\n\n0:04:12\tSPEAKER_01\n 6867-793-6596-880559-009989-11522-3502-4567-9618237-03574515451-08392-1701-637.\n\n0:04:36\tSPEAKER_01\n 0383929293-1234-61.\n\n0:04:52\tSPEAKER_01\n So if you could just fill out the form and then later on we'll read it with pauses between.\n\n0:04:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:04:58\tSPEAKER_01\n And we're session 2.\n\n0:05:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Should we read next or?\n\n0:05:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Let her fill it out and go ahead and read one more.\n\n0:05:08\tSPEAKER_03\n This is Eric on mic 1, the wireless lapel channel 0.\n\n0:05:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Reading transcript 171-198-01321-0605-06097-2384-50730238.\n\n0:05:31\tSPEAKER_03\n 7302-301-8537-606-950-0908-464-0102-0101-0122-410631-55641-641.\n\n0:06:00\tSPEAKER_03\n 7508.\n\n0:06:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Hi, you're here, Nick.\n\n0:06:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:06:07\tSPEAKER_02\n So this is Dan, mic 3.\n\n0:06:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I said I'm wearing it around my neck, which may be different than wearing it on my head.\n\n0:06:14\tSPEAKER_02\n And the transcript is 151-170-8126-097-0123-5171426-646-76611-87246-379-000.\n\n0:06:39\tSPEAKER_02\n 9-00021-338-44815-5678-7.\n\n0:06:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:06:57\tSPEAKER_00\n So basically, they're kind of like sentences, but with numbers instead of words.\n\n0:07:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:07:02\tSPEAKER_00\n So I'm on number 4 with the microphone around my neck, and I will read these.\n\n0:07:07\tSPEAKER_01\n So you want to pause briefly between each one so that the person transcribing can tell where one ends and one begins.\n\n0:07:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:07:14\tSPEAKER_00\n So short sentence between each line.\n\n0:07:15\tSPEAKER_00\n It really sounds like sentences.\n\n0:07:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Your intonation sounds like something.\n\n0:07:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, you can intonate however you want and imagine that you're reading a number, phone number to someone.\n\n0:07:22\tSPEAKER_00\n 12-131-1502-0.\n\n0:07:25\tSPEAKER_00\n And two zeros, or one, you have, oh, if it's supposed to be supposed to be, oh, you're there.\n\n0:07:32\tSPEAKER_00\n 737-879-9.\n\n0:07:37\tSPEAKER_00\n 0-0105045-325-4473-5274155-67262-798-9-0376040.\n\n0:08:01\tSPEAKER_00\n 0-111-257-39479050505-6050.\n\n0:08:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:08:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Good.\n\n0:08:16\tSPEAKER_01\n So we'll probably do another one at the end of the meeting.\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Just get some more digits.\n\n0:08:19\tSPEAKER_01\n And, okay.\n\n0:08:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Thank you.\n\n0:08:24\tSPEAKER_00\n If I were to be dictating a phone number, I would have done that more slowly, but which would have been easier for the course of this machine.\n\n0:08:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Sure.\n\n0:08:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Was that okay?\n\n0:08:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it was great.\n\n0:08:33\tSPEAKER_02\n We did.\n\n0:08:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:08:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Just long as it's good.\n\n0:08:36\tSPEAKER_01\n What's your mic number, James?\n\n0:08:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Number four.\n\n0:08:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Sorry.\n\n0:08:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Dan doesn't remember what sex he has.\n\n0:08:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but I think I know it's going to figure it out.\n\n0:08:48\tSPEAKER_02\n That's true.\n\n0:08:49\tSPEAKER_01\n It's really difficult.\n\n0:08:50\tSPEAKER_00\n And the voice just knew it.\n\n0:08:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I wrote a scanner program that scans these forms.\n\n0:08:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Anyway, so why did I call you all here?\n\n0:08:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Where I'd like to talk about is the transcription.\n\n0:09:00\tSPEAKER_01\n So as part of this project, we need to transcribe these meetings to do training and test and so on.\n\n0:09:07\tSPEAKER_01\n And so we need word transcripts and speaker change identification, so speaker ID.\n\n0:09:15\tSPEAKER_01\n And so I'd sort of like to know who's going to do the HEAT, IJ, and what tools to use, what other resources you might need.\n\n0:09:23\tSPEAKER_01\n And also what we, things like just the data format and how we're going to do it.\n\n0:09:29\tSPEAKER_03\n So I'm just curious how exactly you got wrote into this.\n\n0:09:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Because my name was mentioned when I wasn't around, but I'm most happy.\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:09:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Because Morgan said he asked you.\n\n0:09:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, he did.\n\n0:09:43\tSPEAKER_00\n And I proved that I was proposed before I was asked.\n\n0:09:47\tSPEAKER_00\n And it doesn't matter.\n\n0:09:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Because I think there's probably a...\n\n0:09:50\tSPEAKER_00\n And that would be probably my fault.\n\n0:09:53\tSPEAKER_00\n And the education that I was interested in in advance, in which case I thank you.\n\n0:09:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Right. Right.\n\n0:09:57\tSPEAKER_01\n And so one of the first questions is, do you need help?\n\n0:10:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I don't.\n\n0:10:01\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not the first question.\n\n0:10:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I guess.\n\n0:10:03\tSPEAKER_02\n So what are we talking about?\n\n0:10:06\tSPEAKER_02\n You're going to do transcriptions.\n\n0:10:07\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm going to provide.\n\n0:10:08\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm going to be, once I'm given the data, I will provide word level transcripts with indication of speakers.\n\n0:10:16\tSPEAKER_00\n I guess speaker change in any case, so speaker ID and words.\n\n0:10:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay. So you're going to do the actual transcriptions yourself.\n\n0:10:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:10:25\tSPEAKER_02\n And do you have a clear...\n\n0:10:26\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, do you sort of...\n\n0:10:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Are you going to have to make up what you did?\n\n0:10:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Or do you have a clear idea of what you're going to do?\n\n0:10:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, it's like something you've done before or...\n\n0:10:36\tSPEAKER_00\n I've transcribed a lot.\n\n0:10:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:38\tSPEAKER_00\n But, you know, they...\n\n0:10:40\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, there are always ways of doing things more efficiently or more...\n\n0:10:44\tSPEAKER_00\n And a more technically sophisticated way.\n\n0:10:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Do you have to speak true English sentences when you do this?\n\n0:10:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, because I'll speak with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a...\n\n0:10:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, I think I should be speaking true English sentences.\n\n0:10:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Sure, well.\n\n0:10:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, so...\n\n0:10:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Are you meant to speak naturally?\n\n0:10:59\tSPEAKER_02\n You're meant to say, oh, I didn't realize who being recorded.\n\n0:11:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, all right.\n\n0:11:02\tSPEAKER_00\n No one told me that.\n\n0:11:03\tSPEAKER_00\n It's my problem.\n\n0:11:04\tSPEAKER_00\n What's going on here?\n\n0:11:05\tSPEAKER_01\n I was saying before we don't really have to worry about people being surprised by it.\n\n0:11:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so typically what I...\n\n0:11:12\tSPEAKER_00\n What I've done before is I have a tape recorder with a reverse button.\n\n0:11:19\tSPEAKER_00\n And you just...\n\n0:11:20\tSPEAKER_00\n You know, if it's word level, you do a...\n\n0:11:23\tSPEAKER_00\n I just hit the rewind button every couple of words and type what I know.\n\n0:11:29\tSPEAKER_00\n And then at the end, do a breeze through to be sure that everything's correct.\n\n0:11:33\tSPEAKER_00\n However, they do have software these days, which with a digitized record, you can have control over replay through some sort of interface.\n\n0:11:41\tSPEAKER_00\n I've never used one of those.\n\n0:11:42\tSPEAKER_00\n I know it would be a wonderful idea.\n\n0:11:44\tSPEAKER_00\n I just...\n\n0:11:45\tSPEAKER_00\n I haven't transcribed in a while.\n\n0:11:47\tSPEAKER_02\n The problem is the nice thing about transcribes is they have foot pedals.\n\n0:11:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Foot pedals, I've used transcribing machines.\n\n0:11:52\tSPEAKER_00\n That's fine.\n\n0:11:53\tSPEAKER_00\n But I frankly didn't find it any more used to me than my handheld tape recorder.\n\n0:11:58\tSPEAKER_00\n That's fine.\n\n0:11:59\tSPEAKER_00\n However, if we have a transcribing machine, I would accept it.\n\n0:12:01\tSPEAKER_00\n The other thing is, you know, having...\n\n0:12:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Getting hold of a transcribe.\n\n0:12:03\tSPEAKER_00\n I think the cog-si has one.\n\n0:12:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, probably the borrower one.\n\n0:12:07\tSPEAKER_00\n You have one yourself?\n\n0:12:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, so that's one because she doesn't let her transcribe.\n\n0:12:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, so that's fine.\n\n0:12:11\tSPEAKER_02\n The other thing is, is that we might be...\n\n0:12:13\tSPEAKER_02\n The other thing is, is that we might be...\n\n0:12:14\tSPEAKER_02\n The other thing is, is that we might be...\n\n0:12:15\tSPEAKER_02\n We might have to convert...\n\n0:12:16\tSPEAKER_02\n We'd have to dump the audio files onto cassette.\n\n0:12:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, I see.\n\n0:12:19\tSPEAKER_02\n And we've given them already got them digitally.\n\n0:12:21\tSPEAKER_02\n It would be...\n\n0:12:22\tSPEAKER_02\n It's quite tempting to use some kind of software thing.\n\n0:12:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, okay.\n\n0:12:26\tSPEAKER_02\n But then there's the question of the ergonomic interface that...\n\n0:12:28\tSPEAKER_01\n I actually have some foot pedals.\n\n0:12:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, that's what I was going to say, is that Adam has foot pedals that we could probably try and rig something up to...\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_03\n What did he say?\n\n0:12:34\tSPEAKER_02\n What did he say?\n\n0:12:35\tSPEAKER_01\n What did he say?\n\n0:12:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Keep word.\n\n0:12:37\tSPEAKER_01\n And they generate keystrokes.\n\n0:12:38\tSPEAKER_02\n How do you... how do you slide which keystrokes they generate?\n\n0:12:41\tSPEAKER_01\n There's a little program that downloads into it.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_01\n And the program...\n\n0:12:44\tSPEAKER_01\n The program probably only runs in Windows, although that we could program it once.\n\n0:12:49\tSPEAKER_01\n And then put it on another machine and it would work.\n\n0:12:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Except for the fact that we would have it on a plug-in.\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_03\n I haven't used that.\n\n0:12:55\tSPEAKER_03\n And does it lose the memory once you've unpowered it?\n\n0:12:58\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:12:59\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't think it does.\n\n0:13:00\tSPEAKER_02\n So, you have...\n\n0:13:01\tSPEAKER_02\n You have these foot pedals, you know, using...\n\n0:13:03\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm not using them anymore.\n\n0:13:04\tSPEAKER_01\n I used to use them.\n\n0:13:05\tSPEAKER_01\n So they're currently set up for a shift control and alt.\n\n0:13:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:08\tSPEAKER_01\n But I don't use them.\n\n0:13:09\tSPEAKER_01\n They're not even plugged in.\n\n0:13:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, wow.\n\n0:13:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:13:12\tSPEAKER_02\n This sounds wonderful.\n\n0:13:14\tSPEAKER_01\n And so, if that would help, I'm sure we wouldn't get donated.\n\n0:13:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, the...\n\n0:13:18\tSPEAKER_02\n The file is no one to pull it, so I want to write it so far.\n\n0:13:22\tSPEAKER_02\n That's true.\n\n0:13:23\tSPEAKER_01\n And it is a PC connection, so it would have to go on a PC somewhere.\n\n0:13:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Now, we're at a pilot phase right now.\n\n0:13:30\tSPEAKER_00\n And what I was told is that beginning...\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_00\n The pilot data would be something like half-hour or...\n\n0:13:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Half-hour to 40 minutes of running text.\n\n0:13:39\tSPEAKER_00\n And so, for the pilot thing, you know, of course this would be useful.\n\n0:13:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:13:44\tSPEAKER_00\n And this is the pilot data.\n\n0:13:45\tSPEAKER_00\n And then you're not being...\n\n0:13:46\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm assuming that I would not be...\n\n0:13:47\tSPEAKER_00\n You know, transcribing all of it.\n\n0:13:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, that was part of the question is that if...\n\n0:13:53\tSPEAKER_01\n If we're doing this regularly, imagine we're doing a couple hours a week of transcripts of recording, I wouldn't expect you to do it all.\n\n0:14:02\tSPEAKER_01\n So the question is, do you know of resources that we could use?\n\n0:14:05\tSPEAKER_01\n So are there grad students or undergrads or just...\n\n0:14:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, okay, so now I've been involved with some of that.\n\n0:14:10\tSPEAKER_00\n At COGSI, so there's an event trip, you know, would typically...\n\n0:14:15\tSPEAKER_00\n And I've done this to supervise undergrads to do this kind of thing.\n\n0:14:19\tSPEAKER_00\n And they...\n\n0:14:20\tSPEAKER_00\n You know, you can give them like...\n\n0:14:21\tSPEAKER_00\n If you give them a little bit of instruction and make an interesting forum, they can do it as a 298 or so.\n\n0:14:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Not a student, whatever.\n\n0:14:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Undergraduate research credit, because what you do is you can...\n\n0:14:31\tSPEAKER_01\n So we only have to give them credits, we don't have to give them money?\n\n0:14:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, you have to be sure you give them compensation.\n\n0:14:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, you do have to pay them.\n\n0:14:38\tSPEAKER_00\n So what I mean is not necessarily monetary, but if they feel like they're getting something out of it, sometimes you can do it that way.\n\n0:14:43\tSPEAKER_00\n And otherwise, as part of a grant, you can do it some sort of minimal wage.\n\n0:14:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we need to find out how much that will cost, so I can pass it on to Morgan.\n\n0:14:51\tSPEAKER_01\n As right now, we have almost no money.\n\n0:14:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:54\tSPEAKER_01\n We need to get cheaper, we can do it the better.\n\n0:14:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, you also want to get quality.\n\n0:14:57\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, so someone's going to have to pass through either a higher level person would pass through, we have to get quality to get it.\n\n0:15:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:15:04\tSPEAKER_00\n But, that's quite...\n\n0:15:06\tSPEAKER_00\n You know, that's been done.\n\n0:15:07\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that asks Susan Irvingtrip what she would recommend on that.\n\n0:15:10\tSPEAKER_00\n She's really...\n\n0:15:11\tSPEAKER_00\n She's done other people that I know.\n\n0:15:12\tSPEAKER_00\n She's the one who supervised the most of those things.\n\n0:15:14\tSPEAKER_00\n What's the name?\n\n0:15:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Dr. Susan Irvingtrip.\n\n0:15:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Thank you.\n\n0:15:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Faculty member in psychology recently retired.\n\n0:15:21\tSPEAKER_02\n So...very well known and discourse in houses.\n\n0:15:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:15:25\tSPEAKER_02\n So, I mean, what I'm hearing is that the problem of starting off with some recordings and trying to get word transcripts is kind of...\n\n0:15:33\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not an often a problem.\n\n0:15:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, it's very common.\n\n0:15:36\tSPEAKER_02\n So, basically, there are standard solutions and we just adopt them and it's going to cost however much, going to cost them.\n\n0:15:42\tSPEAKER_02\n It's probably not going to have a lot of flexibility in bringing down the cost because probably the low cost solutions are already been established.\n\n0:15:48\tSPEAKER_02\n So, that's just what everybody else does.\n\n0:15:51\tSPEAKER_00\n I think there's always this question of the trade-off between paying more for the first pass and then editing less later or paying less for the first pass and editing more later.\n\n0:16:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, whatever they... people who have had to do this.\n\n0:16:05\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, anything is only if our requirements are different from...\n\n0:16:09\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, the most been done in the past and discourse analyzed it was because...\n\n0:16:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe we have different requirements in terms of time-align, you know, how much time aligns the detail we need and how much time we need.\n\n0:16:22\tSPEAKER_02\n But that's just people.\n\n0:16:23\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know how much... I don't think we do need any timeline details.\n\n0:16:26\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, we just have basically one text file which runs from the end of the end.\n\n0:16:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, in terms of transcripts, sure, but in terms of speaker change, it might be nice to get the actual time.\n\n0:16:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Sure. But not if it costs more.\n\n0:16:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Right. Well, okay. So what happened with switchboard was at least, I mean, the output was that they had speaker turns.\n\n0:16:47\tSPEAKER_03\n And they analyzed it in terms of, you know, this is where the speaker change came in.\n\n0:16:54\tSPEAKER_03\n And of course, that gets really difficult when you're talking about...\n\n0:16:56\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, this is some of the stuff that you were talking about in your lunch talk is that, you know, you get back channels and stuff like that.\n\n0:17:05\tSPEAKER_03\n And stuff like that that, you know, disrupt the segment, you know, the...\n\n0:17:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:17:12\tSPEAKER_02\n And it's sort of... in some sense, it's a little bit easier with switchboard to the telephone.\n\n0:17:18\tSPEAKER_02\n And so actually people less flexible in what they do.\n\n0:17:21\tSPEAKER_02\n In this situation where they've got non-bubble channels, there's a lot of fiber that, and it's just a very good model.\n\n0:17:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:17:29\tSPEAKER_01\n So in terms of data format, what are we going to do about that? I mean, you have the STM format where you have, you know, every phrase, every utterance is a single speaker.\n\n0:17:39\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, is that the right way to do it? Or...\n\n0:17:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Every utterance is a single speaker, or is just the utterance is going to have a lot?\n\n0:17:44\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, is that the right way to do it?\n\n0:17:46\tSPEAKER_02\n I think so.\n\n0:17:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay. I think, I mean, I think when I'm like, all right, mid-sentence, that should be like one.\n\n0:17:53\tSPEAKER_02\n So that means that for each utterance, we'll need the time marks.\n\n0:18:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:18:04\tSPEAKER_01\n The start and end of each utterance.\n\n0:18:06\tSPEAKER_02\n So, we'll have to get in somewhere, we can necessarily...\n\n0:18:09\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, we may have to get the transcribed to give them to us if we give them software, but they may not, which goes much better.\n\n0:18:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Some other way, like, the first time in my turn, you know, it can't be done.\n\n0:18:18\tSPEAKER_03\n So maybe we should look at the tools that Mississippi State has.\n\n0:18:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Because I know that they published annotation tools.\n\n0:18:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, X-Waves have some as well, but they're pretty low level.\n\n0:18:33\tSPEAKER_01\n They're designed for...\n\n0:18:35\tSPEAKER_01\n For a phoneme level.\n\n0:18:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Although they actually have a nice tool for...\n\n0:18:40\tSPEAKER_01\n That could be used for speaker change, marking.\n\n0:18:43\tSPEAKER_02\n There's a whole bunch of tools for the one page where they have a list of like kind of them.\n\n0:18:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Are you speaking about Mississippi State per se, or...?\n\n0:18:51\tSPEAKER_02\n No, no, no, that's some...\n\n0:18:52\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, I just...\n\n0:18:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Actually, I wanted to mention...\n\n0:18:54\tSPEAKER_00\n There are two projects, which are international, huge projects focused on this kind of thing.\n\n0:19:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Actually, one of them is mate, one of them is Eagles.\n\n0:19:03\tSPEAKER_00\n And both of them have...\n\n0:19:05\tSPEAKER_00\n You know about the big book.\n\n0:19:07\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it got it as a prize or something.\n\n0:19:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:10\tSPEAKER_00\n I was surprised.\n\n0:19:11\tSPEAKER_00\n And they have...\n\n0:19:14\tSPEAKER_00\n A lot of...\n\n0:19:15\tSPEAKER_00\n And mate is a project, which is being run out of Denmark.\n\n0:19:18\tSPEAKER_00\n And they have a lot...\n\n0:19:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Big...\n\n0:19:21\tSPEAKER_00\n You know, they're trying to set up a workbench or something or other.\n\n0:19:23\tSPEAKER_00\n And they have a whole bunch of tools that are associated with them.\n\n0:19:25\tSPEAKER_00\n So I mean, there are things that...\n\n0:19:27\tSPEAKER_00\n In terms of like the timeline, that issue...\n\n0:19:29\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, you guys are more expert in that.\n\n0:19:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Then I am, but I want to say that I know for a fact...\n\n0:19:33\tSPEAKER_00\n I keep running across these.\n\n0:19:34\tSPEAKER_00\n And those would be my first two choices of looking at Eagles and mate.\n\n0:19:37\tSPEAKER_00\n And I have the documentation downstairs.\n\n0:19:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, I'm doing it.\n\n0:19:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Have you looked at it already?\n\n0:19:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, I have, but it wasn't interested in that particular issue.\n\n0:19:43\tSPEAKER_00\n So I've now, once you have words, you know, how do you timeline them?\n\n0:19:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, so these are particularly for time alignment.\n\n0:19:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, these are tools...\n\n0:19:51\tSPEAKER_00\n So, mate and Eagles are both within the so-called language engineering branch.\n\n0:19:56\tSPEAKER_00\n And so, they're intended for this kind of a computer science application type of approach.\n\n0:20:04\tSPEAKER_00\n These are not discourse types of tools.\n\n0:20:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Are they just for time alignment or are they for transcripts as well?\n\n0:20:10\tSPEAKER_00\n I just don't go down to get my stuff.\n\n0:20:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Because I do think...\n\n0:20:12\tSPEAKER_00\n I just take the thing with you.\n\n0:20:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Are you serious?\n\n0:20:15\tSPEAKER_00\n To wireless mean it?\n\n0:20:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Well...\n\n0:20:17\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know what happened, but you guys well.\n\n0:20:18\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, can you spare like a minute or two of five?\n\n0:20:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Sure, sure.\n\n0:20:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, and I'll go get my books and I'll be right back.\n\n0:20:23\tSPEAKER_00\n I think I'm ready.\n\n0:20:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so you guys...\n\n0:20:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:20:26\tSPEAKER_02\n My...\n\n0:20:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Can you hear all your conversations all in the way?\n\n0:20:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, so...\n\n0:20:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Don't talk to yourself too much.\n\n0:20:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, you're pretty quiet. It's itching there, so...\n\n0:20:33\tSPEAKER_02\n That's true. You can't leave it behind as well if you want.\n\n0:20:40\tSPEAKER_02\n So, for the digits...\n\n0:20:42\tSPEAKER_02\n I see you do some projects when they do the whole thing, right?\n\n0:20:45\tSPEAKER_02\n So they probably will have tools to address the actual...\n\n0:20:48\tSPEAKER_02\n...and then ultimately line the first ones...\n\n0:20:52\tSPEAKER_02\n...right?\n\n0:20:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Right, but we can do one minute line.\n\n0:20:57\tSPEAKER_03\n That's not a problem.\n\n0:20:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Right, I think.\n\n0:20:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I'm not sure if we can do automated alignment or not.\n\n0:21:06\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, especially in the...\n\n0:21:08\tSPEAKER_01\n...speaker change in a meeting like this where we're overlapping so much, I don't think we're going to have a prayer.\n\n0:21:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, sure.\n\n0:21:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, to get the actual transcript, I think we'll do okay...because of the separate channels.\n\n0:21:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, that's true. Right. We can just do it through these.\n\n0:21:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:21:23\tSPEAKER_01\n I hadn't even talked about that, sure.\n\n0:21:25\tSPEAKER_01\n In terms of data formats, what I did for the digit stuff was just to hand-rolled my own that looks like this form.\n\n0:21:33\tSPEAKER_01\n You know, it's just something that's easy to parse and purl.\n\n0:21:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Probably for the full one, we'll want to do something like STM.\n\n0:21:42\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, some format that our tools already work with.\n\n0:21:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, yes.\n\n0:21:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, that might...\n\n0:21:49\tSPEAKER_02\n...but we'll have one that has several formats, but you can then do that between one and one.\n\n0:21:56\tSPEAKER_02\n...presentable.\n\n0:21:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Rather than letting our format work just take whatever comes out of the tools that you can find in the...\n\n0:22:02\tSPEAKER_01\n I guess that's true.\n\n0:22:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Right. I've got no idea about that.\n\n0:22:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, I know that...\n\n0:22:11\tSPEAKER_03\n...the Mississippi State Tools, at least what they produce does not come out in STM format.\n\n0:22:16\tSPEAKER_03\n They basically give...\n\n0:22:19\tSPEAKER_03\n...they subdivide into wave files, and then they give...\n\n0:22:22\tSPEAKER_03\n...for each... they give a one, you know, a wave file that indicates where the certain stop times are.\n\n0:22:29\tSPEAKER_03\n And then give the...\n\n0:22:31\tSPEAKER_03\n...whatever, the sentence information.\n\n0:22:34\tSPEAKER_03\n But I mean, as you said, it was easy to convert back and forth between...\n\n0:22:41\tSPEAKER_03\n...that filing STM format.\n\n0:22:43\tSPEAKER_03\n In fact, what I did is I took the Mississippi State data and just made STM files out of it.\n\n0:22:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, good.\n\n0:22:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, made market print work with K.\n\n0:22:52\tSPEAKER_00\n...especially cutting work bench.\n\n0:22:55\tSPEAKER_02\n...and then back in here.\n\n0:22:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, no, it has the word XML in it.\n\n0:23:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:23:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Must be... must be fundable then.\n\n0:23:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, it's going to pop out for a minute.\n\n0:23:06\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, it looks like...\n\n0:23:07\tSPEAKER_03\n...work packages must be a European project.\n\n0:23:09\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it is a European.\n\n0:23:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Both these are European, but they have American contributions.\n\n0:23:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, so they're using the Olympic work bench from MITRE.\n\n0:23:17\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:23:18\tSPEAKER_03\n I guess.\n\n0:23:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Is that free?\n\n0:23:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:23:21\tSPEAKER_00\n But you see, they have a whole bunch of things.\n\n0:23:22\tSPEAKER_00\n What they're doing is trying to bring together...\n\n0:23:24\tSPEAKER_00\n...and they rate things.\n\n0:23:25\tSPEAKER_00\n I wasn't focused on that, so I didn't...\n\n0:23:26\tSPEAKER_00\n...let me show you.\n\n0:23:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Have you seen this one, Dan?\n\n0:23:29\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:23:30\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll try and get one for you, too.\n\n0:23:31\tSPEAKER_00\n There you go.\n\n0:23:32\tSPEAKER_00\n What are you looking at here?\n\n0:23:33\tSPEAKER_00\n He's got the mockup framework.\n\n0:23:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:23:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Different coding systems.\n\n0:23:37\tSPEAKER_01\n It doesn't have enough pictures, so I think it will require too much reading to understand where this is.\n\n0:23:40\tSPEAKER_01\n I see.\n\n0:23:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Anything.\n\n0:23:42\tSPEAKER_01\n They're reviewingly used.\n\n0:23:43\tSPEAKER_00\n What they're doing is they're comparing all these existing things...\n\n0:23:46\tSPEAKER_00\n...that have been submitted.\n\n0:23:47\tSPEAKER_00\n And this one includes the TEI.\n\n0:23:48\tSPEAKER_00\n So it's a pretty broad base.\n\n0:23:55\tSPEAKER_00\n TEI is...\n\n0:23:56\tSPEAKER_00\n That's a text encoding initiative.\n\n0:23:57\tSPEAKER_00\n That's a way of mockup.\n\n0:23:59\tSPEAKER_00\n So, you know, but focusing on tools to do this stuff, I do have a file also in addition to those things.\n\n0:24:07\tSPEAKER_00\n But take me just a second here.\n\n0:24:09\tSPEAKER_01\n I guess XML makes some amount of sense.\n\n0:24:11\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm not actually familiar with it, but it seems to be the sort of thing.\n\n0:24:15\tSPEAKER_01\n That this would be good for.\n\n0:24:17\tSPEAKER_00\n By the way, if you start with a basic transcription and a good filter, you can...\n\n0:24:22\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, that's sort of my feeling, that you should be able to translate between an XML and an XML version.\n\n0:24:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:24:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Because at least, you know, with a focus on discourse mostly.\n\n0:24:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, I wanted to...\n\n0:24:35\tSPEAKER_00\n This approach here, this is Uli Hyde from Stuttgart, is query language for research in phonetics, where he wants to build in Toby tags, so you can determine...\n\n0:24:46\tSPEAKER_00\n I wanted to mention this to you.\n\n0:24:47\tSPEAKER_00\n I was going to combine and ask you about this.\n\n0:24:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Do you know about the Stuttgart people?\n\n0:24:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Because he's saying, if you represent...\n\n0:24:56\tSPEAKER_00\n He says that in German, the selves is used in two different ways.\n\n0:25:00\tSPEAKER_00\n So you have...\n\n0:25:01\tSPEAKER_00\n It either means...\n\n0:25:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Himself or it means even.\n\n0:25:03\tSPEAKER_00\n And you can tell a difference in terms of intonation.\n\n0:25:06\tSPEAKER_00\n So they have their recordings such that they can locate things by searching for participational, so intonational tags.\n\n0:25:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Because the trans Square has put in intonational tags?\n\n0:25:20\tSPEAKER_00\n This is true.\n\n0:25:21\tSPEAKER_00\n This is true.\n\n0:25:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Which, of course, is another issue.\n\n0:25:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe not.\n\n0:25:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Exactly, so...\n\n0:25:26\tSPEAKER_00\n And then that one more thing I need to find.\n\n0:25:30\tSPEAKER_03\n But that kind of thing...\n\n0:25:31\tSPEAKER_03\n I think we would probably want to extract automatically.\n\n0:25:34\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, this is a conversation that we should have of Liz.\n\n0:25:39\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:25:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, okay.\n\n0:25:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Right, I think, because she's going to be...\n\n0:25:43\tSPEAKER_03\n She's going to be the one who's the most concerned about this kind of thing.\n\n0:25:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:25:47\tSPEAKER_03\n She may have some ideas on that particular issue.\n\n0:25:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Right, but I think for the initial task, just getting the word trans curves and speaker change, is highest on my list.\n\n0:25:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, that's what Morgan mentioned to me, too.\n\n0:25:58\tSPEAKER_00\n In terms of intonation, but you asked me about tools and things.\n\n0:26:01\tSPEAKER_00\n And there's this one.\n\n0:26:04\tSPEAKER_00\n This is called transcriber.\n\n0:26:06\tSPEAKER_00\n We find our distribution for Linux and Solaris and SGI and Windows.\n\n0:26:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Transcriber is a tool for assisting creation of speech corpora.\n\n0:26:16\tSPEAKER_00\n It allows to manually segment label and transcribe speech signals.\n\n0:26:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Is it in French one?\n\n0:26:22\tSPEAKER_00\n See where I get this.\n\n0:26:23\tSPEAKER_00\n I got this from you, Penn.\n\n0:26:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Penn.\n\n0:26:26\tSPEAKER_02\n I think I found this one.\n\n0:26:27\tSPEAKER_02\n It was one of the state granules.\n\n0:26:28\tSPEAKER_00\n It is possible.\n\n0:26:29\tSPEAKER_00\n It could be French.\n\n0:26:31\tSPEAKER_01\n I can't really tell.\n\n0:26:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I think that...\n\n0:26:35\tSPEAKER_01\n It sounds like you're at least a little familiar with these tools, Jane.\n\n0:26:38\tSPEAKER_01\n So do you feel comfortable just picking one?\n\n0:26:41\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm never used to any of them.\n\n0:26:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:26:44\tSPEAKER_00\n And so I think it would be something that we should work together with in terms of seeing how this...\n\n0:26:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Here's another.\n\n0:26:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, so this is probably what the LDC uses.\n\n0:26:53\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, they do a lot of transcription at the LDC.\n\n0:26:56\tSPEAKER_03\n I could ask my contacts to the LDC what it is they actually use.\n\n0:27:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, I mean, I know...\n\n0:27:02\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, I've got contacts of this.\n\n0:27:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Sign language is interesting.\n\n0:27:06\tSPEAKER_03\n So...\n\n0:27:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Automatic annotation of the Presity and Verbe mobile.\n\n0:27:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:11\tSPEAKER_00\n This is the other thing that...\n\n0:27:13\tSPEAKER_00\n This is part of Eagles.\n\n0:27:14\tSPEAKER_00\n But here again, it's focusing on representation rather than the tools to do this.\n\n0:27:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Why do I feel like...\n\n0:27:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, so how should we proceed on picking a tool?\n\n0:27:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Jane, do you want to pick a few and we'll download them and try them out?\n\n0:27:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Is that the right thing to do?\n\n0:27:29\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that would be lovely.\n\n0:27:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Now, so are we talking about the stage of...\n\n0:27:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Simply the word stage or are you talking about tools that would allow the time alignment as well?\n\n0:27:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, we're not going to do time alignment.\n\n0:27:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, we have the time alignment, but we'll probably do it ourselves.\n\n0:27:44\tSPEAKER_02\n So we're not concerned about getting...\n\n0:27:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:27:47\tSPEAKER_02\n...bying in.\n\n0:27:48\tSPEAKER_02\n We're very good at time alignments.\n\n0:27:50\tSPEAKER_02\n We're not going to get it, but we're proud of ourselves.\n\n0:27:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:27:53\tSPEAKER_00\n Absolutely.\n\n0:27:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:27:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Right, and so...\n\n0:27:57\tSPEAKER_01\n But in terms of what the transcriber needs to do, they're not going to have to do time alignments.\n\n0:28:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:28:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Except maybe for word speaker change, but...\n\n0:28:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:28:04\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, it's not about...\n\n0:28:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, look.\n\n0:28:06\tSPEAKER_02\n He's a snack.\n\n0:28:07\tSPEAKER_02\n He says, why?\n\n0:28:08\tSPEAKER_02\n I use a snack.\n\n0:28:09\tSPEAKER_02\n That's a TCL or DO thing that I...\n\n0:28:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, then we'll have to use it.\n\n0:28:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Very cool.\n\n0:28:14\tSPEAKER_02\n I have to use it.\n\n0:28:15\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm sure it's a TCL.\n\n0:28:16\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm sure it's just wonderful.\n\n0:28:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Cool.\n\n0:28:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:20\tSPEAKER_02\n The transcriber is developed with a scripting language TCLTK and C extension.\n\n0:28:23\tSPEAKER_02\n License, snacks, sound extension, which that's what that's called.\n\n0:28:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Cool.\n\n0:28:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Where the recognition on what you just mumble is going to be really horrible.\n\n0:28:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:32\tSPEAKER_01\n That's the French one.\n\n0:28:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, cool.\n\n0:28:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:28:36\tSPEAKER_00\n There you go.\n\n0:28:37\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:28:38\tSPEAKER_02\n I've never done that.\n\n0:28:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Someone mentioned it to me.\n\n0:28:40\tSPEAKER_02\n And that's probably why they mentioned it to me because they thought I would be excited because the TCL based.\n\n0:28:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Did you see this one?\n\n0:28:44\tSPEAKER_00\n I just saw it.\n\n0:28:45\tSPEAKER_00\n That's number two.\n\n0:28:47\tSPEAKER_02\n That's number two.\n\n0:28:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Three point one.\n\n0:28:49\tNone\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:28:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:28:50\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's called transcriber, you said?\n\n0:28:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:28:53\tSPEAKER_02\n So it's free there.\n\n0:28:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Wow.\n\n0:28:56\tSPEAKER_03\n So it's very interesting.\n\n0:29:03\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, it's interesting that one of the coordinators on that is Mark Lieberman from the LDC, which means that.\n\n0:29:09\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know what coordinator means in terms of that.\n\n0:29:17\tSPEAKER_03\n But what is this one, patron?\n\n0:29:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, I apparently, you know, I roam around on topics like this.\n\n0:29:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Sure.\n\n0:29:24\tSPEAKER_00\n And I think I got this off the UPIN and it does in fact side of French site.\n\n0:29:28\tSPEAKER_00\n So they have some sort of an arrangement.\n\n0:29:30\tSPEAKER_01\n I just wrote down the French site and I will check it and try to download it.\n\n0:29:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:29:35\tSPEAKER_00\n And see what it looks like.\n\n0:29:36\tSPEAKER_00\n You can access it through the, what if I can't remember which aspect of UPIN is?\n\n0:29:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:29:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Must have been the LDC.\n\n0:29:45\tSPEAKER_00\n I bet you anything.\n\n0:29:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:47\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, they have a, I have a big, big, recall, but they have a tool's page somewhere with like lists and lists and lists of various sort of tools.\n\n0:29:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, we have a special project as I'm remembering and usually it doesn't deal with much that has to do with discourse, but they show up and do research.\n\n0:30:05\tSPEAKER_01\n So we'll start with transcriber and if it looks like that's not going to do what we need.\n\n0:30:10\tSPEAKER_01\n We'll move on to the Mississippi state and if it doesn't look like that's going to work, we'll look at something else.\n\n0:30:14\tSPEAKER_00\n I like the idea of also doing one that's tied in with these larger core projects.\n\n0:30:19\tSPEAKER_00\n So, I think that it's UPIN.\n\n0:30:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:30:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Also, I wanted to mention just in passing that another thing we're going to want to start collecting is queries for the meetings.\n\n0:30:30\tSPEAKER_01\n So if over the next couple days you find yourself wondering what we talked about in the meeting, right down the sort of query you'd like to make.\n\n0:30:37\tSPEAKER_01\n Do you understand what I mean?\n\n0:30:38\tSPEAKER_01\n So imagine that we had meeting recorder all done and you had one, what might you do with it?\n\n0:30:47\tSPEAKER_01\n So if they occur to you.\n\n0:30:49\tSPEAKER_01\n So like did the French system use to?\n\n0:30:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:30:52\tSPEAKER_01\n That's a good one.\n\n0:30:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Actually, what I would have told you was just email me though.\n\n0:30:56\tSPEAKER_03\n What was the web address of that thing which we didn't record?\n\n0:30:59\tSPEAKER_01\n We didn't record that.\n\n0:31:00\tSPEAKER_01\n It's www.etca.fr.\n\n0:31:04\tSPEAKER_00\n You can get it to the UPIN.\n\n0:31:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Slash, slash, capital CTA.\n\n0:31:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Slash about the stuff.\n\n0:31:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:12\tSPEAKER_02\n So this thing, this deliverable D3.1 of the mate project is a review of a lot of different tools.\n\n0:31:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:31:18\tSPEAKER_02\n There you go.\n\n0:31:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Actually, there seems to be more.\n\n0:31:21\tSPEAKER_02\n The tool, the main focus of tools is you've already got a transcription page trying to tag the different terms of the transcriptions with discourse roles.\n\n0:31:29\tSPEAKER_02\n I see that, but a lot of the more tools that we'll say the transcription as well, and I could be wrong.\n\n0:31:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, my question, I really thought of these resources.\n\n0:31:38\tSPEAKER_00\n In the context of you, you're asking about time aligning the, you know, what would you need to indicate and why the tools for that?\n\n0:31:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Because I suspect that would be pretty time.\n\n0:31:48\tSPEAKER_00\n I also want to say in terms of like, you know, if there are discussions about intonation contours, I do have a certain amount of background.\n\n0:31:54\tSPEAKER_03\n I really would like to be able to.\n\n0:31:59\tSPEAKER_03\n No, right.\n\n0:32:00\tSPEAKER_03\n I didn't mean to imply that we shouldn't discuss this now, but I'm just saying that.\n\n0:32:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, I don't know right now, but I mean in the future.\n\n0:32:05\tSPEAKER_00\n So at this meeting with Liz, you know, I mean.\n\n0:32:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:32:08\tSPEAKER_01\n I'd like to take that stuff.\n\n0:32:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Sure.\n\n0:32:10\tSPEAKER_03\n So when is she showing up?\n\n0:32:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, I mean, they're coming in April.\n\n0:32:14\tSPEAKER_03\n April.\n\n0:32:15\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:32:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:32:17\tSPEAKER_03\n But, you know, we may or may not talk before then on that.\n\n0:32:22\tSPEAKER_03\n We won't probably talk until we have more data, I would think.\n\n0:32:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:32:28\tSPEAKER_01\n And since we have almost none right now, let's, we need to move forward from there.\n\n0:32:33\tSPEAKER_01\n But yeah, it's okay.\n\n0:32:36\tSPEAKER_01\n And then there's also just the general question of, will it handle multiple channels?\n\n0:32:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Or should we just, Dan and I spoke about this briefly, do we want to try to combine channels somehow to make the transcribers job easier?\n\n0:32:48\tSPEAKER_01\n I was listening to some of it and like if you just listen to the FAR PCM, the person sitting at this end of the table, you can hardly hear at all.\n\n0:32:58\tSPEAKER_01\n On the transcript.\n\n0:32:59\tSPEAKER_01\n So there may be, it may be worthwhile to at least try a little bit to combine the channels.\n\n0:33:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:33:06\tSPEAKER_02\n The stuff I did I combined Paz, these interstereia pads, listen to the stereo.\n\n0:33:12\tSPEAKER_02\n I was very impressed by how well you could hear separate speakers, but I haven't done very extensive.\n\n0:33:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Both of that would be interesting as well to do that.\n\n0:33:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, could you get, you get, you got something on a special function.\n\n0:33:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:33:26\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not consistent, but it's nice.\n\n0:33:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I bet if he used this one, the two most separated PZMs, well maybe maybe not.\n\n0:33:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, he would, you would sound like you'd have like in this, like a big, big one.\n\n0:33:39\tSPEAKER_02\n You know, you get, good, you get good pick up by the time of the table.\n\n0:33:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:33:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:33:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, do we have anything else to talk about with transcripts?\n\n0:33:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, what is, what is the goal?\n\n0:33:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:55\tSPEAKER_02\n We're going to end up with some, I mean ultimately we're going to end up with transcriptions of these meetings.\n\n0:34:02\tSPEAKER_01\n And we'll run a train and neural net and create a recognizer and do, and then information retrieval.\n\n0:34:12\tSPEAKER_02\n It will be done, huh?\n\n0:34:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, that's my interest.\n\n0:34:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, other people have different interests.\n\n0:34:17\tSPEAKER_01\n That's what I want.\n\n0:34:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Of course, there are different kinds of records.\n\n0:34:21\tSPEAKER_02\n So we're going to actually try to recognize it based on these far-field mics.\n\n0:34:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:34:27\tSPEAKER_02\n That's the problem I try to solve.\n\n0:34:29\tNone\n Right.\n\n0:34:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, the reason we're doing near-field as well is if that doesn't work, we want to back, we want some,\n\n0:34:36\tSPEAKER_02\n and also the name that will allow us to do the time-alignment. Right.\n\n0:34:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:34:41\tSPEAKER_02\n So these are near-field?\n\n0:34:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:34:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Quest mics.\n\n0:34:46\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, yeah, I feel like that, what we're actually going to do with the status is very unclear to me.\n\n0:34:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Why?\n\n0:34:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Because I didn't think that.\n\n0:34:56\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not going to work, right?\n\n0:34:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, we're going to get hard.\n\n0:35:00\tSPEAKER_01\n The question is, is it will it work well enough to do information retrieval?\n\n0:35:03\tSPEAKER_01\n So will the application, the meeting recorder application, work?\n\n0:35:08\tSPEAKER_01\n So part of the research is 50% accuracy enough to do useful information retrieval.\n\n0:35:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, it might be.\n\n0:35:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, we know the answer to that, but unfortunately, will we get 50% accuracy?\n\n0:35:21\tSPEAKER_01\n That's right.\n\n0:35:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, but, you know, we have to try.\n\n0:35:24\tSPEAKER_01\n We could simply not do the project, but I think that's a bad question.\n\n0:35:27\tSPEAKER_03\n We also need to do this in terms of smart com.\n\n0:35:29\tSPEAKER_03\n I mean, we're collecting this as to build general English and Cusic models that can be, that they can say, okay, here's the vocabulary, and here's the, you know, here are the pronunciations and go to it.\n\n0:35:43\tSPEAKER_02\n And have they specifically filed?\n\n0:35:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:47\tSPEAKER_01\n I didn't know that.\n\n0:35:48\tSPEAKER_00\n You know, if we were to add an addition, and I'm offering this to the word level, also the, so stressed words within utterances, I do think that that would help the information retrieval.\n\n0:36:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I mean, that would be tremendously useful information, assuming that we actually, we see it, but we've got a huge problem because if we want to try and recognize it, we need tens of hours of labeled data.\n\n0:36:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, good point.\n\n0:36:14\tSPEAKER_02\n And it's just the, it's very funny.\n\n0:36:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Yep.\n\n0:36:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Do you think, so are you familiar with this, the Marce, the Marce, project?\n\n0:36:24\tSPEAKER_00\n So, I'll put this over here because he seems to be the chairman.\n\n0:36:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Who?\n\n0:36:29\tSPEAKER_00\n We's not?\n\n0:36:30\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:36:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, he is the open piece of paper.\n\n0:36:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Open open.\n\n0:36:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, well, he can, he can, he can.\n\n0:36:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, Dan's got an open number.\n\n0:36:37\tSPEAKER_03\n He just got a discount.\n\n0:36:38\tSPEAKER_01\n I have one, but I carefully covered it, so that it doesn't.\n\n0:36:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:36:42\tSPEAKER_00\n This is a project that has timeline spoken data, which is, I see this sort of in between these fields, because a lot of the time when people do rich, international and stress-oriented transcription, they don't have the digital record at the same time and they don't have a timeline.\n\n0:37:04\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know how large this is, actually, but I just was sort of thinking that I'm, and it's British.\n\n0:37:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I think to some extent, with things like the stress and the other prasodic things and tighter time and life, and so we can do, I think we should probably do those, but only once we have a consumer of that data.\n\n0:37:24\tSPEAKER_01\n So, right now, we have a consumer of the word transcripts and the speaker change.\n\n0:37:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Me, I want those things to work.\n\n0:37:31\tSPEAKER_01\n And so, I would like to get that done as quickly as possible.\n\n0:37:34\tSPEAKER_01\n And so, if Liz or someone else wants to do some work on a prosody and on stress and so on, then we can go back to the data and generate the transcripts that we need.\n\n0:37:49\tSPEAKER_00\n One thing about that is that in the process of doing the word level, it really is just as easy to put the stress in at that.\n\n0:37:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Even for an undergrad?\n\n0:37:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, well, see, in my pilot stuff.\n\n0:38:00\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm doing the half hour so that I'm doing, I just as soon put it in, because I do think that you'd find that those would be words.\n\n0:38:05\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, of course, Rosari is pursuing this.\n\n0:38:08\tSPEAKER_00\n But I really do think, from everything that I've ever run across, that you should get gay in terms of what you're saying.\n\n0:38:17\tSPEAKER_00\n Information retrieval aspects from that.\n\n0:38:20\tSPEAKER_00\n And I wouldn't be too surprised.\n\n0:38:22\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know how reliable he is, but his idea of islands of...\n\n0:38:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Security?\n\n0:38:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Security?\n\n0:38:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Security?\n\n0:38:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Security?\n\n0:38:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:35\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean...\n\n0:38:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Are you certain?\n\n0:38:37\tSPEAKER_01\n No.\n\n0:38:38\tSPEAKER_00\n The claim that words that get stressed are easier to recognize.\n\n0:38:42\tSPEAKER_00\n So, I mean, I think there'd be sort of a benefit with very minimal input.\n\n0:38:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Because when you listen to a sentence, you can tell if it's contrastive stress, you know, of that word with stress.\n\n0:38:51\tSPEAKER_00\n And why they have not put it in at the word level.\n\n0:38:54\tSPEAKER_00\n So, I mean, the part that I'm doing, I'm really happy to supply that with that.\n\n0:38:57\tSPEAKER_00\n It's just...\n\n0:38:58\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not just taking any thinking.\n\n0:39:00\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not going to talk about, you know, trying to grade them in any kind of careful way, but just indicate if there's a prominent word.\n\n0:39:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Sure.\n\n0:39:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it's great.\n\n0:39:08\tSPEAKER_01\n All caps.\n\n0:39:09\tSPEAKER_02\n No, I'm assuming there's a...\n\n0:39:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Whatever.\n\n0:39:12\tSPEAKER_02\n...on the tation's time.\n\n0:39:13\tSPEAKER_02\n It's perfect.\n\n0:39:14\tSPEAKER_02\n People...\n\n0:39:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, people do different ways.\n\n0:39:16\tSPEAKER_00\n And just as long as it's systematic in my view, you can always filter it into some of those.\n\n0:39:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Exactly.\n\n0:39:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Anything else?\n\n0:39:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, so, what is the plan we're going to...\n\n0:39:33\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm going to go down to the transcriber.\n\n0:39:35\tSPEAKER_01\n And Jane and I will look at it.\n\n0:39:36\tSPEAKER_02\n That recording schedule.\n\n0:39:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, how many meetings are we going to record?\n\n0:39:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Which ones are we going to transcribe?\n\n0:39:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I think the answer is we need to record as many as we can.\n\n0:39:50\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't see any reason not to try to record a meeting or two a week.\n\n0:39:56\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, more if we can.\n\n0:39:59\tSPEAKER_01\n And so, I want to start by in the next couple of weeks just doing the speech group until we get to the point where we're fairly comfortable with the hardware and the software and everything works.\n\n0:40:10\tSPEAKER_01\n And then I think I'll also, Jerry, volunteer to have his group do a few.\n\n0:40:14\tSPEAKER_01\n So, I'll try to get those as well.\n\n0:40:17\tSPEAKER_00\n How many of these do you have, these nearby mics?\n\n0:40:21\tSPEAKER_01\n We have five of the wireless.\n\n0:40:23\tSPEAKER_01\n And then we're going to be getting a bunch of wired ones as well.\n\n0:40:27\tSPEAKER_01\n I mean, notice that you used to it up and walked around none of the rest of us have.\n\n0:40:31\tSPEAKER_01\n And so, we could have wired mics and it wouldn't be a big deal for bigger meetings.\n\n0:40:35\tSPEAKER_01\n I see.\n\n0:40:37\tSPEAKER_01\n So...\n\n0:40:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Wow, I'm just really impressed by this.\n\n0:40:42\tSPEAKER_01\n It really makes you feel like you're doing real work when you get all this hardware.\n\n0:40:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, this is, I mean, compared to the way people normally do like discourse stuff, you know, it's like you got your...\n\n0:40:51\tSPEAKER_00\n They've gotten away from real to real tapes.\n\n0:40:55\tSPEAKER_00\n And they do have dat recorders.\n\n0:40:57\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, you do have them.\n\n0:40:58\tSPEAKER_00\n But, I mean, this is just wonderful.\n\n0:41:00\tSPEAKER_00\n The added level of compactness in there.\n\n0:41:03\tSPEAKER_00\n If what you're doing is...\n\n0:41:05\tSPEAKER_00\n I do find myself whispering. I mean, I just feel like...\n\n0:41:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Why?\n\n0:41:09\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know why.\n\n0:41:10\tSPEAKER_01\n I had noticed that you were talking quietly and I was actually going to ask you...\n\n0:41:13\tSPEAKER_01\n I was going to ask you to speak up, but I didn't want you to feel self-conscious.\n\n0:41:16\tSPEAKER_00\n The problem is that I'm afraid that I'm talking into someone's ear.\n\n0:41:19\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't really do.\n\n0:41:20\tSPEAKER_00\n So, it was like...\n\n0:41:21\tSPEAKER_00\n And I realized now that you have volume control.\n\n0:41:25\tSPEAKER_00\n But, yeah.\n\n0:41:26\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't feel like you're speaking on that.\n\n0:41:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, good.\n\n0:41:30\tSPEAKER_02\n I mean, I feel like it's all...\n\n0:41:31\tSPEAKER_03\n I hear what you say.\n\n0:41:33\tSPEAKER_02\n That's great.\n\n0:41:35\tSPEAKER_02\n That makes sense.\n\n0:41:36\tSPEAKER_02\n That makes sense.\n\n0:41:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Because he's not heavily encumbered with us.\n\n0:41:39\tSPEAKER_03\n I am.\n\n0:41:40\tSPEAKER_03\n If somebody else wanted, but we'll palmike.\n\n0:41:42\tSPEAKER_01\n I've been trying to rotate it through.\n\n0:41:43\tSPEAKER_01\n So, Dan, we'll get it next time.\n\n0:41:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Are these more expensive or less expensive than this time?\n\n0:41:47\tSPEAKER_02\n And much more expensive.\n\n0:41:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:41:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Which I don't understand.\n\n0:41:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Be like a television effect or something, maybe.\n\n0:41:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:41:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Because if you like television, you'll feel like television's fun.\n\n0:41:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you feel like a television star?\n\n0:41:56\tSPEAKER_00\n That's probably why I thought he was a chairman.\n\n0:41:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, that's it.\n\n0:41:59\tSPEAKER_00\n That makes sense.\n\n0:42:00\tSPEAKER_01\n That makes sense.\n\n0:42:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Because he's not heavily encumbered with us.\n\n0:42:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Right.\n\n0:42:05\tSPEAKER_01\n You should have run it under your sweater, though.\n\n0:42:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:42:08\tNone\n Yes.\n\n0:42:09\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:42:10\tSPEAKER_02\n What I'm like.\n\n0:42:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, we should read some numbers, then.\n\n0:42:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:42:14\tSPEAKER_02\n We don't read that.\n\n0:42:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:42:16\tSPEAKER_03\n I think we're there.\n\n0:42:17\tSPEAKER_03\n How much space do we have left?\n\n0:42:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Tons.\n\n0:42:19\tSPEAKER_02\n We've got two hours of space.\n\n0:42:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, really?\n\n0:42:21\tSPEAKER_01\n He changed the down sampling.\n\n0:42:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:42:24\tSPEAKER_01\n So, this is Adam on mic number two, wireless headset.\n\n0:42:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Transcript 191-210-9-012431-22937-4880701-56707-9491-032-089-19362660-234-63-7981-6366.\n\n0:42:51\tSPEAKER_01\n 850-960-234-63-7988-6-850-960.\n\n0:43:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:43:08\tSPEAKER_03\n This is Eric on microphone number one, channel zero.\n\n0:43:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Reading transcript 211-230.\n\n0:43:18\tSPEAKER_03\n 08109-01084030.\n\n0:43:25\tSPEAKER_03\n 3120-4253-5569-799-809-0212-243-45.\n\n0:43:33\tSPEAKER_03\n 690-799-809-0212-243-45.\n\n0:43:48\tSPEAKER_03\n 6017-852-82590-94793-07.\n\n0:43:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Here here.\n\n0:44:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Transcript 231-250-071-1209-1-3011-530-635-7104-7723-889-02025-3404-47.\n\n0:44:33\tSPEAKER_02\n 550-3854-678-0195-01072.\n\n0:44:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:44:49\tSPEAKER_00\n This is Jane.\n\n0:44:50\tSPEAKER_00\n This is mic number four.\n\n0:44:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Transcript 251-270.\n\n0:44:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:45:03\tSPEAKER_00\n 192-345-7241-8100-9586-095-08984-1-208889-4153586-5349-64-78.\n\n0:45:25\tSPEAKER_00\n 899-090-900213-147.\n\n0:45:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Hey.\n\n0:45:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Thanks very much.\n\n0:45:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Just control C, Dan.\n\n0:45:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "SPEAKER, Jane, Eric and Dan are going to have a meeting.
