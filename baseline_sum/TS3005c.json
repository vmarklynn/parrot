It's single curved.\n\n0:06:45\tSPEAKER_02\n It's too dimensional.\n\n0:06:47\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's best drawn green.\n\n0:06:51\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a color.\n\n0:06:53\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a brass color.\n\n0:06:54\tSPEAKER_02\n New.\n\n0:06:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Forward blank.\n\n0:06:57\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:07:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's make it black.\n\n0:07:03\tSPEAKER_02\n I thought of an idea like this.\n\n0:07:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, not that.\n\n0:07:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Blank.\n\n0:07:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:07:20\tSPEAKER_02\n It also looks nice when it's on your table.\n\n0:07:23\tSPEAKER_02\n It doesn't lay flat down on the table, but it stands.\n\n0:07:28\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a side view.\n\n0:07:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, it's a side view.\n\n0:07:31\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm not technically good at 3D modeling.\n\n0:07:37\tSPEAKER_02\n It's just an idea I had.\n\n0:07:40\tSPEAKER_02\n It also looks nice when it's on the table.\n\n0:07:43\tSPEAKER_02\n The graphical user interface and the buttons.\n\n0:07:46\tSPEAKER_02\n We also thought about that already.\n\n0:07:48\tSPEAKER_02\n I thought about the LCD touch screen, which is easy to clean too.\n\n0:07:54\tSPEAKER_02\n One of the great advantages of the LCD screen is just to use some classics or other cleaning stuff.\n\n0:08:03\tSPEAKER_02\n It should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright.\n\n0:08:08\tSPEAKER_02\n I already explained some properties of that material.\n\n0:08:12\tSPEAKER_02\n I think, oh, you also almost concluded about that.\n\n0:08:17\tSPEAKER_02\n This should be our two button component.\n\n0:08:22\tSPEAKER_02\n That's all about the buttons.\n\n0:08:27\tSPEAKER_02\n We also thought about that already.\n\n0:08:30\tSPEAKER_02\n It will be chargeable with an option for a mount station.\n\n0:08:34\tSPEAKER_02\n You can put the remote control in a mount station.\n\n0:08:39\tSPEAKER_02\n It charges itself up instead of plugging it in or something like that.\n\n0:08:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Questions?\n\n0:08:45\tSPEAKER_02\n No, no, no, no.\n\n0:08:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Just looking.\n\n0:08:47\tSPEAKER_02\n They should be long lasting.\n\n0:08:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Not via MTA in about two minutes or 30 minutes or 40 minutes of use.\n\n0:08:55\tSPEAKER_02\n The next step is the chip.\n\n0:08:58\tSPEAKER_02\n The component that makes or transmits the signal to the television.\n\n0:09:04\tSPEAKER_02\n There was an option to use a rather simple chip, but I think because of our highly requiring requirements.\n\n0:09:15\tSPEAKER_02\n There should be an advanced chip in it with also the ability to facilitate speech recognition.\n\n0:09:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Unfortunately, it's still in a test phase.\n\n0:09:25\tSPEAKER_02\n There should be some more investigation on that side.\n\n0:09:31\tSPEAKER_02\n My personal preference is, I also overheard in the last meeting that we should use our own business scholars.\n\n0:09:41\tSPEAKER_02\n That was correct, wasn't it?\n\n0:09:44\tSPEAKER_02\n I think they are rather boring for use with rubber.\n\n0:09:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, business scholars, I thought it was the slogan and the corporate image.\n\n0:09:54\tSPEAKER_02\n They should be in mind, wasn't it?\n\n0:09:56\tSPEAKER_03\n But I don't think you have to make the entire thing in there.\n\n0:09:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, so it doesn't have to have the slogan recognized.\n\n0:10:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, okay.\n\n0:10:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, that's possible, of course.\n\n0:10:06\tSPEAKER_02\n You could make a little R&R on the top of the machine.\n\n0:10:11\tSPEAKER_02\n So they are pretty boring, I suggest because the availability with rubber to make fantastic colors.\n\n0:10:18\tSPEAKER_02\n And also, in a lot of possible colors, so it's possible to make very fancy remote controls, which people, in which people will find their interesting.\n\n0:10:31\tSPEAKER_02\n And we'll buy them faster when they look at the same old gray or black colors.\n\n0:10:39\tSPEAKER_02\n As I said before, rubber is impossible to damage severely.\n\n0:10:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Instead of, of course, you can break it when you break it, for example, with paracysses or something like that.\n\n0:10:53\tSPEAKER_02\n But if you drop it, it's not broken right away.\n\n0:10:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Instead of using plastic, hard plastic or titanium.\n\n0:11:01\tSPEAKER_02\n And I personally like the single curved remote control.\n\n0:11:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Because it makes it fancy.\n\n0:11:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay. Well, that's all about my findings.\n\n0:11:13\tSPEAKER_03\n All right.\n\n0:11:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, thank you.\n\n0:11:16\tSPEAKER_03\n I will go next.\n\n0:11:28\tSPEAKER_00\n All right, so I saw a little bit about the interface.\n\n0:11:32\tSPEAKER_00\n I should look.\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_00\n The term that there will be no buttons, but only an LCD screen, so I have to look on that.\n\n0:11:44\tSPEAKER_00\n And the design is therefore based on what we just thought of.\n\n0:11:50\tSPEAKER_00\n First, there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition.\n\n0:11:55\tSPEAKER_00\n And this is that you ask, you give a question through the device.\n\n0:12:01\tSPEAKER_00\n And it answers you.\n\n0:12:03\tSPEAKER_00\n And they already put this in a coffee maker.\n\n0:12:06\tSPEAKER_00\n And so that you say, good morning, coffee maker.\n\n0:12:10\tSPEAKER_00\n And it says, says, do you back?\n\n0:12:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Good morning, Joe, or what's your name?\n\n0:12:15\tSPEAKER_00\n This is an easy way to program that.\n\n0:12:18\tSPEAKER_00\n You say, record into the device, into the speaker.\n\n0:12:21\tSPEAKER_00\n And then you say the question and three seconds later, you say the answer.\n\n0:12:24\tSPEAKER_00\n And then when you say the question, it gives you the answer.\n\n0:12:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Perhaps it's useful, but because people lose the remote, they can yell.\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Remote, where are you?\n\n0:12:35\tSPEAKER_00\n And that's because that calls for something.\n\n0:12:37\tSPEAKER_00\n That's true.\n\n0:12:38\tSPEAKER_00\n And perhaps you could implement that.\n\n0:12:40\tSPEAKER_00\n And then I have to go out of the presentation, because I try to make some kind of ID or what you do, but I can draw.\n\n0:12:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Don't make too much of it.\n\n0:12:53\tSPEAKER_00\n I try to the LCD screen.\n\n0:12:56\tSPEAKER_00\n I try to draw.\n\n0:12:58\tSPEAKER_00\n I thought at least the icon for the volume.\n\n0:13:02\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know if there's an icon for the program, but...\n\n0:13:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Just be.\n\n0:13:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, just be.\n\n0:13:07\tSPEAKER_00\n And then the buttons above and below, the mute button, also very nice, as an icon.\n\n0:13:16\tSPEAKER_05\n So what's the button for two digits?\n\n0:13:19\tSPEAKER_00\n I forgot that one.\n\n0:13:21\tSPEAKER_00\n I thought I forgot something.\n\n0:13:23\tSPEAKER_00\n And the numbers, it should be a bit larger, I think.\n\n0:13:28\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not really on scale and...\n\n0:13:30\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:13:31\tSPEAKER_00\n An options button.\n\n0:13:33\tSPEAKER_00\n And I thought the button for the tail text apart, because it's not really options, I think.\n\n0:13:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Options are the settings of the remote and of the TV and that kind of thing.\n\n0:13:44\tSPEAKER_00\n You could call it settings or something.\n\n0:13:46\tSPEAKER_00\n But this is a bit how I thought it.\n\n0:13:49\tSPEAKER_00\n And the LCD somewhere on your remote, perhaps you could be more curvy to remote perhaps.\n\n0:13:56\tSPEAKER_00\n So that's better in your hand or something.\n\n0:14:00\tSPEAKER_00\n And a microphone for the speech recognition if you want to implement that.\n\n0:14:06\tSPEAKER_00\n And then if you press the options button, we have an example of...\n\n0:14:14\tSPEAKER_00\n And then you should get the other options with what you could do and that you could do with something like this.\n\n0:14:21\tSPEAKER_00\n It's also...\n\n0:14:24\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we discussed earlier that older people don't really want to use these extra settings.\n\n0:14:31\tSPEAKER_00\n And older people also don't really want to use this kind of option we use.\n\n0:14:37\tSPEAKER_00\n So they want to use one button and then something happens.\n\n0:14:40\tSPEAKER_00\n And not choose with this kind of...\n\n0:14:44\tSPEAKER_00\n And you could put a really scrolling device on the side of your remote.\n\n0:14:49\tSPEAKER_00\n So you could scroll across these things.\n\n0:14:52\tSPEAKER_00\n That's an option.\n\n0:14:55\tSPEAKER_00\n And that was my finding thing.\n\n0:15:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Thanks.\n\n0:15:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Third.\n\n0:15:05\tSPEAKER_04\n No daddy.\n\n0:15:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Remember this presentation.\n\n0:15:14\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:15:24\tSPEAKER_05\n I'm going to tell you something about the trend washing.\n\n0:15:26\tSPEAKER_05\n The trends from the past years, what people like, what youngsters like, what elderly people like, about shapes, colors, material and stuff.\n\n0:15:37\tSPEAKER_05\n The way that I use was...\n\n0:15:41\tSPEAKER_05\n Like I told, I watched the trends from past years about color shapes, material they wanted from elderly and young people.\n\n0:15:48\tSPEAKER_05\n So we can keep that in mind for designing the files itself.\n\n0:15:54\tSPEAKER_05\n Files are made.\n\n0:15:56\tSPEAKER_05\n The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look fancy.\n\n0:16:02\tSPEAKER_05\n The second important thing that should be enough in a fadive.\n\n0:16:07\tSPEAKER_05\n Like the LCD screen that's quite innovative.\n\n0:16:10\tSPEAKER_05\n So that should be great meeting for this.\n\n0:16:13\tSPEAKER_05\n And the third thing is it should be East Use.\n\n0:16:16\tSPEAKER_05\n I think with only one menu for button channel volume, it should also be enough for East Use.\n\n0:16:23\tSPEAKER_05\n The personal preferences for the young people, they liked fruity colors, like banana yellow, strawberry red and stuff.\n\n0:16:31\tSPEAKER_05\n Grass green.\n\n0:16:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, like that.\n\n0:16:34\tSPEAKER_05\n The round shapes and soft materials, like the rubber, it should be soft, it should be feeling spongy or sponge bob.\n\n0:16:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Like this.\n\n0:16:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Let's build it into a sponge.\n\n0:16:47\tSPEAKER_05\n Elderly people like colors which you are being seen in autumn, like wood, dark brown, red, deep red and stuff.\n\n0:16:57\tSPEAKER_05\n They like square shapes with round edges and hard materials like wood, titanium, those kind of materials they like.\n\n0:17:09\tSPEAKER_05\n This is a bit like the young people's like, the fruity colors, innovative, all the colors you see the blue, the red, the white, yellow, that stuff.\n\n0:17:19\tSPEAKER_05\n And then I personally thought a front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like this or something.\n\n0:17:32\tSPEAKER_05\n It's a bit like banana and the color should be yellow or something.\n\n0:17:37\tSPEAKER_05\n And for the elderly people just plain old because we decided to have two kind of remotes, two designs or was it two colors?\n\n0:17:46\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, different colors, yeah. We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes.\n\n0:17:50\tSPEAKER_05\n I think like my colleague, you said, is that it's better or for the elderly people something like the iPod or something with round squares.\n\n0:18:01\tSPEAKER_05\n Simple but easy to use.\n\n0:18:06\tSPEAKER_05\n So that's it.\n\n0:18:07\tSPEAKER_05\n That's why people are more traditional. Yeah, like the older colors I can maybe...\n\n0:18:16\tSPEAKER_00\n You could change the colors that was also the only shape you should take.\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_03\n The colors are easy to change.\n\n0:18:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Change the shape of the old one.\n\n0:18:27\tSPEAKER_00\n Perhaps you could find something in the middle. Round corners but square.\n\n0:18:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe then both groups won't buy it.\n\n0:18:37\tSPEAKER_00\n If you do it square with round corners but a little in the middle.\n\n0:18:45\tSPEAKER_02\n I know what you mean, you kind of like a mouse bone.\n\n0:18:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Like this.\n\n0:18:58\tSPEAKER_00\n So it's a bit square but it's also a bit...\n\n0:19:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Kind of like a beer glass.\n\n0:19:04\tSPEAKER_00\n So but then...\n\n0:19:06\tSPEAKER_00\n I know what you mean. Same size.\n\n0:19:10\tSPEAKER_02\n It's also easy to put in your hand.\n\n0:19:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but it's also how other remotes are shaped.\n\n0:19:17\tSPEAKER_00\n So that's...\n\n0:19:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Perhaps that's good thing. So that's easy to use.\n\n0:19:20\tSPEAKER_00\n People know that.\n\n0:19:21\tSPEAKER_02\n We'll recognize that's a remote control.\n\n0:19:24\tSPEAKER_02\n What I saw in your...\n\n0:19:26\tSPEAKER_05\n Something like that. You know, autumn colors like red, brown.\n\n0:19:31\tSPEAKER_05\n They like the wood a lot.\n\n0:19:33\tSPEAKER_05\n So maybe we could give it like a wooden look or something.\n\n0:19:37\tSPEAKER_05\n A bit old-school style.\n\n0:19:41\tSPEAKER_05\n Red, suns, medieval.\n\n0:19:44\tSPEAKER_05\n That's what it's all about.\n\n0:19:46\tSPEAKER_05\n That's kind of things.\n\n0:19:48\tSPEAKER_05\n So you see the big difference between the young people.\n\n0:19:50\tSPEAKER_05\n Fresh, exciting.\n\n0:19:52\tSPEAKER_05\n And old people.\n\n0:19:53\tSPEAKER_05\n That's easy to look at.\n\n0:19:55\tSPEAKER_05\n So, sorry.\n\n0:19:56\tSPEAKER_00\n That's easy to do with the color.\n\n0:19:58\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, I think it's easier to do in color than in shape.\n\n0:20:01\tSPEAKER_05\n Otherwise we have to get different shapes and colors just way easier than shapes.\n\n0:20:07\tSPEAKER_05\n And material, yeah, rubber.\n\n0:20:09\tSPEAKER_05\n Rubber is like I said, young people like more soft materials.\n\n0:20:13\tSPEAKER_05\n They're spongy ones.\n\n0:20:14\tSPEAKER_05\n And the old people like plain wood.\n\n0:20:17\tSPEAKER_05\n So we have to decide if we're going to use re-hards rubber or soft rubber.\n\n0:20:24\tSPEAKER_05\n Or something.\n\n0:20:25\tSPEAKER_05\n Something between that.\n\n0:20:26\tSPEAKER_05\n Soft rubber.\n\n0:20:27\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, soft rubber.\n\n0:20:28\tSPEAKER_05\n Which you can feel in it.\n\n0:20:31\tSPEAKER_05\n I know you.\n\n0:20:32\tSPEAKER_02\n No, I think you should be promoted.\n\n0:20:34\tSPEAKER_05\n No, or what should be next.\n\n0:20:36\tSPEAKER_05\n No, no, but you have to like like a erase or something.\n\n0:20:42\tSPEAKER_05\n That's a bit you can press it in or something harder.\n\n0:20:48\tSPEAKER_00\n But like this kind of rubber.\n\n0:20:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, something like this, yeah.\n\n0:20:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Quite hard.\n\n0:20:54\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes, quite hard, but you can press it in.\n\n0:20:55\tSPEAKER_05\n It feels kind of spongy.\n\n0:20:57\tSPEAKER_05\n spongy.\n\n0:20:58\tSPEAKER_05\n Something like this.\n\n0:20:59\tSPEAKER_04\n No, think it's rubber.\n\n0:21:06\tSPEAKER_03\n No, no, no.\n\n0:21:07\tSPEAKER_03\n So we need a spongy feeling.\n\n0:21:09\tSPEAKER_00\n If you have something.\n\n0:21:10\tSPEAKER_04\n We're going to invite SpongeBob.\n\n0:21:12\tSPEAKER_04\n Maybe he can.\n\n0:21:13\tSPEAKER_00\n So we should first decide about shape, I think.\n\n0:21:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I think it's a better thing to do.\n\n0:21:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Then you can fit the LCD screen in it.\n\n0:21:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, I can't help it.\n\n0:21:22\tNone\n I can't help it.\n\n0:21:24\tSPEAKER_02\n I also can't help it.\n\n0:21:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Notice, as you used, you had a remote control, but the LCD screen was rather small.\n\n0:21:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I think the LCD screen should be like your size.\n\n0:21:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:41\tSPEAKER_02\n But I think it should be larger.\n\n0:21:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, three quarter of the, three quarters.\n\n0:21:45\tSPEAKER_02\n So you don't have to put your,\n\n0:21:47\tSPEAKER_05\n but it won't get that small when LCD screen is.\n\n0:21:52\tSPEAKER_02\n So when you got this. Can I like this?\n\n0:22:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Or should it be larger, I think.\n\n0:22:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Larger, because you want to put your hands.\n\n0:22:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, because you can put your hands there.\n\n0:22:14\tSPEAKER_00\n And then you won't touch the screen.\n\n0:22:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, true, true, true, true.\n\n0:22:18\tSPEAKER_02\n You're thumb here.\n\n0:22:19\tSPEAKER_00\n But not on the screen, because.\n\n0:22:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:23\tSPEAKER_00\n That's all the side.\n\n0:22:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Because when you put your hands on it.\n\n0:22:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but if you make the LCD screen as large as the remote control itself, you always get some.\n\n0:22:34\tSPEAKER_02\n You always touch it.\n\n0:22:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:36\tSPEAKER_05\n You can be very greasy and stuff, but you won't get that small, because you have how much?\n\n0:22:40\tSPEAKER_05\n 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 buttons on the screen.\n\n0:22:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:44\tSPEAKER_05\n You don't want it too small.\n\n0:22:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, how large?\n\n0:22:48\tSPEAKER_05\n You have to, you have to, because some fat people would thick fingers.\n\n0:22:52\tSPEAKER_05\n You have to keep your dress tree, but it's the same time.\n\n0:22:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, if you want to make it international, Japanese people get rather small hands.\n\n0:22:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, true, but we have the soul option.\n\n0:23:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Zoom option.\n\n0:23:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Of course.\n\n0:23:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:04\tSPEAKER_02\n You can make it larger with a company.\n\n0:23:07\tSPEAKER_02\n A greater feel to push the button.\n\n0:23:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:10\tSPEAKER_03\n And we won't include a pen or something to point.\n\n0:23:13\tSPEAKER_02\n What do you have a finger?\n\n0:23:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Your fingers, yeah.\n\n0:23:16\tSPEAKER_02\n You lose a pen.\n\n0:23:17\tSPEAKER_02\n You lose a pen.\n\n0:23:18\tSPEAKER_02\n You lose a pen, you can't use it.\n\n0:23:19\tSPEAKER_03\n You can't use it with a finger.\n\n0:23:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:22\tSPEAKER_00\n You have to.\n\n0:23:23\tSPEAKER_00\n They think it's handy to use pen.\n\n0:23:25\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:26\tSPEAKER_00\n I think this is a good size for the screen.\n\n0:23:29\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know how large the external remote should be with a bit.\n\n0:23:33\tSPEAKER_03\n And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all that.\n\n0:23:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but that can be used to put any soft tissue.\n\n0:23:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, you can buy those.\n\n0:23:43\tSPEAKER_03\n If I can interrupt you, maybe I should show some points on which we should take a decision.\n\n0:23:50\tSPEAKER_03\n Sure.\n\n0:23:51\tSPEAKER_03\n So we can discuss these points.\n\n0:23:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Those points.\n\n0:23:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Energy question mark.\n\n0:23:59\tSPEAKER_03\n How should we supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do with separate docking station and then put accused in it?\n\n0:24:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, chip on print and case. Those are points my coach advised me to discuss here, but I hope you have ideas about them.\n\n0:24:16\tSPEAKER_00\n I think energy or batteries and then the docking station.\n\n0:24:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, so that's the first point to include rechargeable batteries.\n\n0:24:25\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:26\tSPEAKER_05\n Which you can recharge through the docking station.\n\n0:24:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:30\tSPEAKER_05\n So if the batteries are dead.\n\n0:24:32\tSPEAKER_02\n I kind of like you.\n\n0:24:33\tSPEAKER_02\n You've got some some of those wireless mice.\n\n0:24:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Computer mouse.\n\n0:24:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Kind of like those kind of batteries.\n\n0:24:45\tSPEAKER_00\n But it should be, I think, normal batteries.\n\n0:24:47\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, normal playing.\n\n0:24:49\tSPEAKER_05\n No, normal playing batteries.\n\n0:24:50\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:51\tSPEAKER_05\n You can buy the supermarket or refill.\n\n0:24:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Or be very rechargeable.\n\n0:24:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:55\tNone\n Batteries.\n\n0:24:56\tSPEAKER_00\n And what was with the chip on print?\n\n0:25:01\tSPEAKER_02\n The chip on print.\n\n0:25:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:04\tSPEAKER_02\n I think so.\n\n0:25:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Chip on print with a simple, yeah, simple, but we also discard that.\n\n0:25:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Didn't we?\n\n0:25:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but how does that work with LCD screen?\n\n0:25:20\tSPEAKER_03\n You still have a...\n\n0:25:22\tSPEAKER_02\n You always have a print plate.\n\n0:25:26\tSPEAKER_04\n Thank you, Juan.\n\n0:25:27\tSPEAKER_04\n You always have a print plate.\n\n0:25:29\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, sure, of course.\n\n0:25:31\tSPEAKER_04\n Always so.\n\n0:25:32\tSPEAKER_04\n I don't know what we have to decide about that.\n\n0:25:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, well, it's a good question.\n\n0:25:37\tSPEAKER_03\n It was in there and I didn't have any...\n\n0:25:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Chip on print, I think what I mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got, it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button.\n\n0:25:48\tSPEAKER_02\n But when you got an LCD screen, Yeah, okay.\n\n0:25:51\tSPEAKER_02\n With no...\n\n0:25:52\tSPEAKER_02\n With not...\n\n0:25:53\tSPEAKER_02\n The buttons are not always on the same place.\n\n0:25:55\tSPEAKER_02\n For example, if you enlarge a button, or if you got several options appearing on your screen, the code nations aren't always the same.\n\n0:26:04\tSPEAKER_02\n When you got a regular button, the button of standby is always on the same place.\n\n0:26:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I don't know.\n\n0:26:09\tSPEAKER_05\n And you get on the print plate of LCD screen, there's more at fault than the low print plate.\n\n0:26:13\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:14\tSPEAKER_05\n So that's not of any discussion, I think.\n\n0:26:17\tSPEAKER_03\n No, you need some kind of CPU, I guess.\n\n0:26:19\tSPEAKER_03\n I suppose so.\n\n0:26:20\tSPEAKER_02\n No, I don't know.\n\n0:26:21\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't think...\n\n0:26:22\tSPEAKER_02\n It is a simple CPU, where it is.\n\n0:26:24\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:26:25\tSPEAKER_05\n But I don't know if...\n\n0:26:28\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, because it has to...\n\n0:26:30\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, it's quite a simple LCD screen.\n\n0:26:32\tSPEAKER_05\n I think they don't need that...\n\n0:26:34\tSPEAKER_02\n The remote control has to know where you're in a settings menu, or just...\n\n0:26:38\tSPEAKER_02\n You just want to turn on the volume.\n\n0:26:40\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, okay, true.\n\n0:26:41\tSPEAKER_05\n True.\n\n0:26:42\tNone\n True.\n\n0:26:43\tSPEAKER_02\n True.\n\n0:26:45\tSPEAKER_02\n So it has to have some kind of...\n\n0:26:49\tSPEAKER_02\n calculation unit on CPU, to know in which state you are, and which button you are pressing at the right moment.\n\n0:26:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Because we're projecting the buttons on the LCD screen.\n\n0:27:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, it's a touchscreen.\n\n0:27:04\tSPEAKER_02\n And the touchscreen makes it possible to get the coordination of your finger on screen.\n\n0:27:10\tSPEAKER_02\n In the case, yeah, we already discussed the case, so we wanted to make it from rubber.\n\n0:27:14\tSPEAKER_00\n But the hard rubber, like this, or softer rubber?\n\n0:27:16\tSPEAKER_02\n The hard rubber, I think.\n\n0:27:17\tSPEAKER_02\n That's easy to...\n\n0:27:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:20\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm down to the back from the floor when you...\n\n0:27:22\tSPEAKER_00\n We have different colors.\n\n0:27:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, this is...\n\n0:27:26\tSPEAKER_05\n The shapes is something between square shapes with round shapes.\n\n0:27:33\tSPEAKER_05\n No, I don't think...\n\n0:27:36\tSPEAKER_05\n It's more round than square.\n\n0:27:38\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it's a bit longer.\n\n0:27:41\tSPEAKER_00\n So it meets...\n\n0:27:42\tSPEAKER_05\n I think it meets more the young people than the older people.\n\n0:27:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but that's what we wanted.\n\n0:27:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's how it started to turn into a main target.\n\n0:27:49\tSPEAKER_05\n It's loaded for the years, I think.\n\n0:27:53\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know how about my idea of making it...\n\n0:27:58\tSPEAKER_02\n with one single curve.\n\n0:28:00\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, yeah, that's...\n\n0:28:01\tSPEAKER_05\n I think I thought that was quite...\n\n0:28:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Because it's a gadget, and you want to show it off, of course.\n\n0:28:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, you have a fancy design, right away.\n\n0:28:09\tSPEAKER_05\n You can put it on your table, with LCD screen.\n\n0:28:12\tSPEAKER_05\n You don't have to put it in your head.\n\n0:28:14\tSPEAKER_05\n You can put it next to you, and then...\n\n0:28:16\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, that's good.\n\n0:28:17\tSPEAKER_05\n It's not easy.\n\n0:28:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:21\tSPEAKER_02\n So...\n\n0:28:22\tSPEAKER_02\n So you write that down, and you get a single curve, rubber, fancy colored, remote control.\n\n0:28:32\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, you can draw it on your paper, and then...\n\n0:28:35\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, you can...\n\n0:28:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but I don't understand.\n\n0:28:40\tSPEAKER_04\n And load it on the...\n\n0:28:41\tSPEAKER_04\n the user, the server.\n\n0:28:43\tSPEAKER_03\n About the user interface, there are also some questions.\n\n0:28:48\tSPEAKER_03\n About the concepts, I think.\n\n0:28:50\tSPEAKER_03\n You have some ideas.\n\n0:28:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I have what I...\n\n0:28:53\tSPEAKER_00\n You showed you drawing.\n\n0:28:54\tSPEAKER_00\n I should...\n\n0:28:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Go...\n\n0:28:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Go again.\n\n0:29:00\tSPEAKER_00\n I miss a few buttons, but...\n\n0:29:07\tSPEAKER_00\n At least, you should also have...\n\n0:29:09\tSPEAKER_00\n I just remembered a menu to go back to the first...\n\n0:29:14\tSPEAKER_00\n but if you touch options, you can go back to this right away.\n\n0:29:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Now, the server...\n\n0:29:21\tSPEAKER_04\n Isn't it better to have the sound and the channel buttons horizontal?\n\n0:29:26\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:29:28\tSPEAKER_00\n With the minus and the plus.\n\n0:29:29\tSPEAKER_05\n I think it's easier than...\n\n0:29:32\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't know.\n\n0:29:33\tSPEAKER_00\n I thought it was easier to handle this way, but I don't know what they think.\n\n0:29:38\tSPEAKER_01\n That's right.\n\n0:29:39\tSPEAKER_00\n If you like the buttons, the horizontal vertical.\n\n0:29:44\tSPEAKER_02\n The horizontal screen, if you make the screen vertical, it does not matter.\n\n0:29:48\tSPEAKER_02\n If you make it in a rectangle.\n\n0:29:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, if you make it like this...\n\n0:29:53\tSPEAKER_00\n So, if you...\n\n0:29:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Put it like this...\n\n0:29:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Where?\n\n0:29:58\tSPEAKER_05\n I think it's easier to have it...\n\n0:30:01\tSPEAKER_05\n something like...\n\n0:30:03\tSPEAKER_05\n the button minus here...\n\n0:30:06\tSPEAKER_05\n plus over here...\n\n0:30:09\tSPEAKER_05\n minus here...\n\n0:30:11\tSPEAKER_05\n plus over here...\n\n0:30:13\tSPEAKER_05\n and on here...\n\n0:30:15\tSPEAKER_05\n the other buttons...\n\n0:30:17\tSPEAKER_05\n and on here...\n\n0:30:18\tSPEAKER_05\n the top...\n\n0:30:20\tSPEAKER_05\n the options...\n\n0:30:21\tSPEAKER_00\n But I think...\n\n0:30:22\tSPEAKER_05\n And then you have something like the B over here...\n\n0:30:26\tSPEAKER_05\n and the sound...\n\n0:30:29\tNone\n I think that's another one you're used to.\n\n0:30:32\tSPEAKER_00\n I think I would put a plus in the middle here...\n\n0:30:35\tSPEAKER_00\n and then the P in the middle and the sound...\n\n0:30:38\tSPEAKER_00\n and then the P in the middle and the sound...\n\n0:30:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Something like...\n\n0:30:44\tSPEAKER_05\n Something like...\n\n0:30:47\tNone\n Shit.\n\n0:30:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Take your time.\n\n0:30:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:30:55\tSPEAKER_04\n Plus, minus, plus...\n\n0:31:00\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh!\n\n0:31:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Almost.\n\n0:31:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes, I think when you're holding it, you could press the minus in the plus...\n\n0:31:10\tSPEAKER_00\n and with the other finger, the minus in the plus.\n\n0:31:14\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, I think you're going to...\n\n0:31:16\tSPEAKER_05\n you're going to use it with one sound.\n\n0:31:18\tSPEAKER_00\n But I think...\n\n0:31:20\tSPEAKER_00\n perhaps I have some...\n\n0:31:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Will you use the build engineering there?\n\n0:31:24\tSPEAKER_04\n Who's the usability engineering?\n\n0:31:26\tSPEAKER_04\n She...\n\n0:31:28\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm going to do some examples.\n\n0:31:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Because perhaps you should choose what's most often used.\n\n0:31:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Because we can use that better.\n\n0:31:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Consistency.\n\n0:31:37\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, I have that...\n\n0:31:39\tSPEAKER_04\n those numbers.\n\n0:31:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes, I have...\n\n0:31:43\tSPEAKER_04\n What good work.\n\n0:31:45\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't really know.\n\n0:31:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Everybody is searching in a tunnel selection.\n\n0:31:50\tSPEAKER_05\n Per hour, 168, volume selection, four times...\n\n0:31:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but I mean if it's usually plus or minus, above each other, of next to each other, I don't know how to reload.\n\n0:32:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Not much often is used, but...\n\n0:32:04\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, I thought you were doing what's on the remote.\n\n0:32:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Looking here, but here's...\n\n0:32:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Below, here also, you know, here's next to each other.\n\n0:32:15\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it's...\n\n0:32:17\tSPEAKER_05\n I think, because I have two televisions at home, one is horizontal, one is vertical.\n\n0:32:22\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, it doesn't really matter.\n\n0:32:24\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:25\tSPEAKER_05\n Tick-picks.\n\n0:32:31\tSPEAKER_00\n I think the volume is usually above each other, because you go higher and down.\n\n0:32:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, lower.\n\n0:32:38\tSPEAKER_00\n And the program is next to each other, because you go further and back.\n\n0:32:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Hmm.\n\n0:32:44\tNone\n True.\n\n0:32:46\tSPEAKER_00\n That's how it is usually.\n\n0:32:48\tSPEAKER_00\n I think that's how I look here.\n\n0:32:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, let's see.\n\n0:32:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's cut the chase.\n\n0:32:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, well, I think we don't have to decide about that now, how well we will put the button.\n\n0:33:03\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know.\n\n0:33:04\tSPEAKER_05\n It is usually at the face.\n\n0:33:07\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:08\tSPEAKER_05\n It's confident.\n\n0:33:09\tSPEAKER_00\n There's actually a design, you should know where you would play.\n\n0:33:14\tNone\n Okay, well...\n\n0:33:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Interface, yeah.\n\n0:33:19\tSPEAKER_00\n And the speech, shall we implement that?\n\n0:33:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, well, we just heard about the new...\n\n0:33:25\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, I think it's easy for that to wear, or you would then just sit down here.\n\n0:33:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Thanks for the book.\n\n0:33:30\tSPEAKER_00\n But then you should also find a place.\n\n0:33:32\tSPEAKER_00\n If you do it like this, you could put it in a corner or something.\n\n0:33:36\tSPEAKER_00\n You can talk into the corner.\n\n0:33:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, microphone.\n\n0:33:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Not even necessary, because you can make a very sensitive microphone to make it possible to just put it around underneath it or on the bottom of it.\n\n0:33:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, maybe at the bottom where you can hold it with your hands, and there's also a microphone over there.\n\n0:33:54\tSPEAKER_03\n So...\n\n0:33:55\tSPEAKER_02\n That's not important.\n\n0:33:56\tSPEAKER_02\n I think that's not very important, because it doesn't matter where the microphone is.\n\n0:34:00\tSPEAKER_00\n But you should decide where you are.\n\n0:34:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, I should.\n\n0:34:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:34:04\tSPEAKER_04\n I think where it isn't seen the most,\n\n0:34:10\tSPEAKER_02\n indeed, it shouldn't be very visible.\n\n0:34:13\tSPEAKER_00\n You put it in a logo of the country. Yeah, shit.\n\n0:34:16\tSPEAKER_05\n No, maybe just in between the round of the R.\n\n0:34:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, because I think it should be in an important position where people can see it, because it is the unique idea of our remote, the speech control.\n\n0:34:27\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Where you want to put it?\n\n0:34:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, maybe it's where...\n\n0:34:30\tSPEAKER_02\n And it doesn't make it any more fancy, because you get to see...\n\n0:34:33\tSPEAKER_00\n It does, because you can find it better if you use it.\n\n0:34:37\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, but...\n\n0:34:38\tSPEAKER_00\n It's a way for you to...\n\n0:34:40\tSPEAKER_00\n So it makes more fancy, because other remote don't have that.\n\n0:34:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:34:45\tSPEAKER_03\n But are we talking about the button or about the microphone?\n\n0:34:47\tSPEAKER_03\n The microphone.\n\n0:34:48\tSPEAKER_03\n There is no button.\n\n0:34:49\tSPEAKER_03\n I like the one. It's very small thing, but you can make it look like it's big, so it's really an important function of the remote.\n\n0:34:58\tSPEAKER_05\n I think the left corner should be the best.\n\n0:35:02\tSPEAKER_05\n Where it isn't...\n\n0:35:05\tSPEAKER_05\n It isn't most inside.\n\n0:35:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:35:08\tNone\n I think...\n\n0:35:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, put it there.\n\n0:35:11\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't mind.\n\n0:35:12\tSPEAKER_02\n It doesn't really matter.\n\n0:35:15\tSPEAKER_04\n No.\n\n0:35:16\tSPEAKER_04\n Actually, does it...\n\n0:35:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:35:19\tSPEAKER_02\n So?\n\n0:35:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Any more...\n\n0:35:21\tSPEAKER_03\n So, well, type...\n\n0:35:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Supplements?\n\n0:35:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Interface type?\n\n0:35:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, well...\n\n0:35:27\tSPEAKER_03\n We already discussed it.\n\n0:35:28\tSPEAKER_03\n The LCD, yeah.\n\n0:35:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Supplements...\n\n0:35:30\tSPEAKER_05\n I think...\n\n0:35:32\tSPEAKER_05\n Like you said, scroll...\n\n0:35:34\tSPEAKER_05\n Next to the remote...\n\n0:35:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Isn't that handy?\n\n0:35:37\tSPEAKER_05\n I think it's better to just type what you'd like to do on the screen.\n\n0:35:41\tSPEAKER_05\n If you want to go back, if a back button goes back, if you want to choose audio settings, press all your settings, and it goes to that sub menu.\n\n0:35:48\tSPEAKER_02\n That's my name to defend.\n\n0:35:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:55\tSPEAKER_00\n The young people do like this...\n\n0:35:57\tSPEAKER_02\n You used to scroll.\n\n0:35:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:35:59\tSPEAKER_02\n So, why not?\n\n0:36:00\tSPEAKER_02\n On...\n\n0:36:01\tSPEAKER_02\n On-side.\n\n0:36:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Or at least, yeah, I don't know after you scroll, but the menu aren't changed that they like most.\n\n0:36:06\tSPEAKER_00\n And I think you can navigate through a menu with a scroll.\n\n0:36:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I think you've got a settings...\n\n0:36:12\tSPEAKER_00\n It's faster.\n\n0:36:13\tSPEAKER_05\n I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options.\n\n0:36:15\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:36:16\tSPEAKER_05\n But if you don't have a lot of options...\n\n0:36:17\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes, yes.\n\n0:36:18\tSPEAKER_05\n You have a lot of options.\n\n0:36:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Because when you use...\n\n0:36:20\tSPEAKER_02\n When you use the settings menu, for example, to look up some...\n\n0:36:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Some channels on your...\n\n0:36:25\tSPEAKER_02\n on your television.\n\n0:36:26\tSPEAKER_02\n You should scroll down...\n\n0:36:28\tSPEAKER_02\n on a menu, which probably does not fit on your screen.\n\n0:36:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:36:33\tSPEAKER_02\n So, then it's very handy to scroll down.\n\n0:36:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:36:37\tSPEAKER_02\n You make just a rubber just like on your mouse, or just put it on a side, and it's very easy to use.\n\n0:36:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, no problem.\n\n0:36:43\tSPEAKER_03\n And I think it will make it even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side,\n\n0:36:49\tSPEAKER_00\n which... It's also different.\n\n0:36:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:36:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:36:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, there's our five minutes...\n\n0:36:57\tSPEAKER_03\n warning.\n\n0:36:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Any more questions about design?\n\n0:37:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Or do you need to face...\n\n0:37:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, components, everyone.\n\n0:37:05\tSPEAKER_04\n Color, sword, clear...\n\n0:37:07\tSPEAKER_04\n And what do you think?\n\n0:37:09\tSPEAKER_02\n The material is clear.\n\n0:37:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, what's the standard color?\n\n0:37:11\tSPEAKER_02\n The standard.\n\n0:37:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, we don't...\n\n0:37:13\tSPEAKER_02\n No, we have different color.\n\n0:37:14\tSPEAKER_02\n How many colors do we have?\n\n0:37:15\tSPEAKER_02\n We have different colors, but you should have a standard color.\n\n0:37:17\tSPEAKER_02\n I think black.\n\n0:37:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, black.\n\n0:37:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Black, I think.\n\n0:37:20\tSPEAKER_02\n With a yellow...\n\n0:37:21\tSPEAKER_05\n Darker, something like this.\n\n0:37:22\tSPEAKER_05\n This color or something.\n\n0:37:23\tSPEAKER_02\n And just a regular...\n\n0:37:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, like...\n\n0:37:26\tSPEAKER_02\n And then have different...\n\n0:37:28\tSPEAKER_05\n I think it's better to have silver nowadays.\n\n0:37:31\tSPEAKER_05\n Silver, yeah.\n\n0:37:32\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's a few more silver...\n\n0:37:33\tSPEAKER_02\n See a lot of silver,\n\n0:37:34\tSPEAKER_05\n a lot of black.\n\n0:37:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, the silver, it's silver, black, our own big colors.\n\n0:37:38\tSPEAKER_05\n I think we have silver, black, and between those...\n\n0:37:41\tSPEAKER_05\n Like, I don't know...\n\n0:37:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Five colors between the...\n\n0:37:45\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, what about a yellow thing?\n\n0:37:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n0:37:48\tSPEAKER_03\n It's better to have yellow, you have...\n\n0:37:49\tSPEAKER_03\n We ugly, but it's definitely fancy.\n\n0:37:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Red.\n\n0:37:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n0:37:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Green.\n\n0:37:54\tSPEAKER_02\n With silver.\n\n0:37:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Rubber...\n\n0:37:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Silver rubber isn't fancy.\n\n0:38:00\tSPEAKER_04\n True?\n\n0:38:01\tSPEAKER_02\n When you use titanium, silver is fancy, but when you use silver rubber, it's fancy.\n\n0:38:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Silver has to shine, and rubber doesn't shine.\n\n0:38:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Especially when you just made a soft rubber like this.\n\n0:38:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:15\tSPEAKER_02\n You understand?\n\n0:38:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I understand.\n\n0:38:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I would think about colors like red, yellow, blue,\n\n0:38:20\tSPEAKER_05\n yeah, of course, the fruity colors. And the autumn colors, like red and brown.\n\n0:38:25\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, dark red and brown, maroon.\n\n0:38:28\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:38:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, so...\n\n0:38:31\tSPEAKER_00\n And do I have to have a normal black one or...\n\n0:38:34\tSPEAKER_03\n Who's it?\n\n0:38:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Pinking.\n\n0:38:36\tSPEAKER_03\n No, I don't think.\n\n0:38:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Pinking.\n\n0:38:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, so that wraps it up.\n\n0:38:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Everybody knows what to do.\n\n0:38:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, I don't know what to do.\n\n0:38:43\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know what to do.\n\n0:38:44\tSPEAKER_01\n I would have done what to do.\n\n0:38:45\tSPEAKER_03\n The next meeting is once again in 30 minutes.\n\n0:38:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Here are the individual actions, and especially notice that the industrial design and usually the interfaces are going to work together on a prototype, a smart board, and of course, to all four of us specific instructions will be emailed by a personal coach.\n\n0:39:07\tSPEAKER_00\n We'll work together, but do we have to stay here or do we?\n\n0:39:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, I'd say just wait for an email and find out.\n\n0:39:14\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:39:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:39:16\tSPEAKER_03\n I think we should work.\n\n0:39:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, well, that was what I had to say.\n\n0:39:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Final thoughts from anyone or...\n\n0:39:21\tSPEAKER_03\n No.\n\n0:39:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, well, thank you very much.\n\n0:39:24\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:39:25\tSPEAKER_05\n How finished?\n\n0:39:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Thank you very much.\n\n0:39:27\tSPEAKER_00\n So, I was thinking, I'm finished now.\n\n0:39:29\tNone\n I think I'll just wait for the things or the emails to get.\n\n0:39:34\tNone\n I'll make a new one for you.\n\n0:39:37\tNone\n Thanks.\n\n0:39:38\tNone\n All right, face out.\n\n0:39:40\tNone\n Bye.\n\n0:39:41\tNone\n Okay, well, I'll try to put the minutes in the project folder as soon as possible.\n\n0:39:47\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:39:48\tNone\n Hopefully, faster this time.\n\n0:39:50\tNone\n Okay, good luck.\n\n0:39:52\tNone\n Well, everything is clear.\n\n0:39:56\tNone\n Is that here?\n\n0:39:57\tNone\n Here, for fun.\n\n0:39:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, this is a smart board.\n\n0:40:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:40:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Thank you.\n\n0:40:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, bye.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "The conceptual design meeting is taking place today.
