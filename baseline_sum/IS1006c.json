We already discussed.\n\n0:12:02\tSPEAKER_04\n And what will people say?\n\n0:12:05\tSPEAKER_04\n They will say it's perfect.\n\n0:12:08\tSPEAKER_04\n Or what will say?\n\n0:12:10\tSPEAKER_04\n They will say it's landed.\n\n0:12:14\tSPEAKER_04\n Everyone will say, I'll buy it.\n\n0:12:16\tSPEAKER_04\n And everyone's going to be satisfied.\n\n0:12:21\tSPEAKER_05\n Do you think it can come in several colors?\n\n0:12:25\tSPEAKER_04\n Or did I would make a backlight of the LCD screen with different colors?\n\n0:12:32\tSPEAKER_04\n But not the case.\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_04\n Not the case.\n\n0:12:34\tSPEAKER_05\n The case would only be in that aluminum titanium stuff.\n\n0:12:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Because apparently from your survey, people like colors.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, well, they like something which is...\n\n0:12:48\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changes both panels.\n\n0:12:52\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, okay, so that would be...\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_05\n Do you like it?\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, I don't know.\n\n0:12:56\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't have a Nokia phone.\n\n0:12:59\tSPEAKER_05\n But it's...\n\n0:12:59\tSPEAKER_00\n I don't use that, but again...\n\n0:13:01\tSPEAKER_00\n That's why you don't have it.\n\n0:13:03\tSPEAKER_03\n That's why.\n\n0:13:03\tSPEAKER_03\n Because it's nasty.\n\n0:13:08\tSPEAKER_00\n But it would be expansion.\n\n0:13:09\tSPEAKER_00\n If you use color LCD...\n\n0:13:11\tSPEAKER_00\n No.\n\n0:13:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Instead of that, maybe we can change the color of the SMB.\n\n0:13:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe we can just...\n\n0:13:20\tSPEAKER_00\n If you just want more colors, they can pay more money to get this...\n\n0:13:27\tSPEAKER_00\n The shapes, I mean, they can have different assembly.\n\n0:13:31\tSPEAKER_04\n Right here.\n\n0:13:33\tSPEAKER_00\n So users have different...\n\n0:13:35\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, they have their own...\n\n0:13:37\tSPEAKER_00\n Interest, color, interest and so on.\n\n0:13:39\tSPEAKER_00\n So if they want, they can just pay another...\n\n0:13:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, so you propose something with option...\n\n0:13:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:47\tSPEAKER_02\n That increase the price if we...\n\n0:13:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:13:50\tSPEAKER_00\n If they want...\n\n0:13:51\tSPEAKER_00\n So that we can...\n\n0:13:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Of course, it's an upgradeable...\n\n0:13:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:55\tSPEAKER_05\n We're both controlled.\n\n0:13:56\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:13:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Just they will get a few more...\n\n0:14:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Things and few more colors.\n\n0:14:02\tSPEAKER_04\n There's one more solution.\n\n0:14:03\tSPEAKER_04\n One more solution, in fact.\n\n0:14:04\tSPEAKER_04\n Because there are some...\n\n0:14:08\tSPEAKER_04\n Some paints that can change color according to where they are.\n\n0:14:13\tSPEAKER_04\n Like they can reflect different colors.\n\n0:14:17\tSPEAKER_02\n Depending on what is around.\n\n0:14:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Like what color is around.\n\n0:14:20\tSPEAKER_04\n And depending on the temperature, yeah.\n\n0:14:23\tSPEAKER_04\n Can make it in fact.\n\n0:14:25\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, but that's maybe too much expensive.\n\n0:14:29\tSPEAKER_02\n But it can be in maybe in a...\n\n0:14:31\tSPEAKER_02\n A gradeable version.\n\n0:14:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Because I think there are two kinds of people.\n\n0:14:35\tSPEAKER_05\n Those for which the remote control is...\n\n0:14:39\tSPEAKER_05\n Is to be something useful.\n\n0:14:42\tSPEAKER_05\n I'm going to talk about this later.\n\n0:14:43\tSPEAKER_05\n But and those for which it's something that...\n\n0:14:46\tSPEAKER_05\n That is specific to them.\n\n0:14:50\tSPEAKER_05\n So it's like a signature.\n\n0:14:53\tSPEAKER_05\n My remote control is pink.\n\n0:14:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Nobody else than me has a pink remote control.\n\n0:14:58\tSPEAKER_05\n And that makes me special.\n\n0:15:03\tSPEAKER_02\n And you think that we don't have to make them pay more?\n\n0:15:10\tSPEAKER_05\n I think they would be ready for that.\n\n0:15:13\tSPEAKER_05\n Those who want it to have it big.\n\n0:15:15\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not a base service.\n\n0:15:18\tSPEAKER_04\n No, not a bad option.\n\n0:15:20\tSPEAKER_04\n It might be optional.\n\n0:15:21\tSPEAKER_00\n But those people will be really few.\n\n0:15:23\tSPEAKER_00\n So like we can cut short the...\n\n0:15:25\tSPEAKER_05\n The young people want to be different from their friends.\n\n0:15:28\tSPEAKER_05\n Although similar, but have something just slightly better.\n\n0:15:32\tSPEAKER_05\n Pink.\n\n0:15:33\tSPEAKER_02\n So maybe that if that is a selling point, maybe it has to be the base.\n\n0:15:39\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, but you know, if you want to be different, you just take your remote control with you all the time.\n\n0:15:46\tSPEAKER_04\n And it's very different, you know?\n\n0:15:47\tSPEAKER_03\n No, no.\n\n0:15:48\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, you want to pass the remote controls here?\n\n0:15:50\tSPEAKER_02\n You don't have to pass the remote control here.\n\n0:15:52\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:15:53\tSPEAKER_02\n I want to change my name.\n\n0:15:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, you know, for instance, take the iPod.\n\n0:15:57\tSPEAKER_05\n It's a kind of remote control.\n\n0:15:59\tSPEAKER_05\n And it's white.\n\n0:16:01\tSPEAKER_05\n And it's so white that you see it from anywhere.\n\n0:16:04\tSPEAKER_05\n It has this distinctive look and feel and look, but which people seem to like.\n\n0:16:12\tSPEAKER_05\n Just because it's a color that we don't usually see in a remote control.\n\n0:16:17\tSPEAKER_05\n White.\n\n0:16:18\tSPEAKER_05\n Uh-huh.\n\n0:16:18\tSPEAKER_04\n Uh-huh.\n\n0:16:19\tSPEAKER_04\n Could we integrate something into our remote control?\n\n0:16:21\tSPEAKER_04\n Something like a light that I can use it in darkness.\n\n0:16:25\tSPEAKER_04\n Very smart.\n\n0:16:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Can light.\n\n0:16:27\tSPEAKER_00\n The dark.\n\n0:16:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, maybe like that infrared.\n\n0:16:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Like we can put some radium chips or something.\n\n0:16:34\tSPEAKER_00\n So that like at least some radium.\n\n0:16:40\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll do a radio with this.\n\n0:16:41\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm sorry.\n\n0:16:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, that.\n\n0:16:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:16:48\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:16:49\tSPEAKER_02\n So.\n\n0:16:49\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, let's go on maybe with a presentation.\n\n0:16:53\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:16:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, sure.\n\n0:16:55\tSPEAKER_04\n And um, the remote control is going to be smart, but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much.\n\n0:17:04\tSPEAKER_04\n And, uh, I don't know.\n\n0:17:09\tSPEAKER_04\n That's a question to you and to.\n\n0:17:13\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, so I heard that it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done.\n\n0:17:18\tSPEAKER_05\n And so that's the smartness of the thing.\n\n0:17:21\tSPEAKER_05\n Currently, we don't have guns with speech recognition or beer cans with speech recognition, but we may have remote controls with speech recognition.\n\n0:17:31\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:17:32\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:17:33\tSPEAKER_04\n That's a nice one.\n\n0:17:37\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, don't touch the remote.\n\n0:17:38\tSPEAKER_05\n Thank you.\n\n0:17:39\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:17:39\tSPEAKER_05\n But yeah, are you saying here that the remote control should be aware of who's using it?\n\n0:17:46\tSPEAKER_05\n So for instance, the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want.\n\n0:17:53\tSPEAKER_05\n Uh, yeah.\n\n0:17:53\tSPEAKER_04\n I just want to say it should be smart.\n\n0:17:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Maybe fingerprint recognition.\n\n0:17:58\tSPEAKER_04\n The voice recognition is quite enough.\n\n0:17:59\tSPEAKER_04\n I say don't use it and the control just looks.\n\n0:18:06\tSPEAKER_04\n Because I ordered.\n\n0:18:07\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm just.\n\n0:18:11\tSPEAKER_00\n That could be feasible.\n\n0:18:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, since we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition also.\n\n0:18:19\tSPEAKER_00\n So it could be.\n\n0:18:20\tSPEAKER_00\n We can.\n\n0:18:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Smart in that way.\n\n0:18:26\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:18:27\tSPEAKER_05\n But for instance, I'm thinking about the other particularity that the remote control could have.\n\n0:18:35\tSPEAKER_05\n Since it knows who is using it, it might also record the kind of channels you're more often using levels of volumes that you're more often.\n\n0:18:48\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, sure.\n\n0:18:48\tSPEAKER_05\n Things like that and provide you ways of using them.\n\n0:18:52\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't know somehow.\n\n0:18:53\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't know.\n\n0:18:54\tSPEAKER_05\n That might be expensive, but that might also be a good sales pitch again.\n\n0:19:00\tSPEAKER_05\n The remote that knows you.\n\n0:19:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:19:10\tSPEAKER_02\n So, My turn.\n\n0:19:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Marketing expert.\n\n0:19:19\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:19:20\tSPEAKER_05\n Sorry.\n\n0:19:20\tSPEAKER_02\n But spent four I think.\n\n0:19:24\tSPEAKER_05\n Trend.\n\n0:19:25\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:19:29\tSPEAKER_05\n No.\n\n0:19:30\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:19:35\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:19:36\tSPEAKER_05\n So I'm going to talk about trends.\n\n0:19:39\tSPEAKER_05\n And then I hope this can help us to understand how we should design our remote control.\n\n0:19:46\tSPEAKER_05\n So next slide please.\n\n0:19:47\tSPEAKER_05\n So first, maybe just a small recap on how do we watch trends?\n\n0:19:54\tSPEAKER_05\n So it's not so simple.\n\n0:19:55\tSPEAKER_05\n You might think that it's easy, but it's not so simple.\n\n0:19:59\tSPEAKER_05\n Anyway, these days, the best source of information is the web, as you know.\n\n0:20:03\tSPEAKER_05\n So I have to go off and on the web and look at what the others are doing.\n\n0:20:11\tSPEAKER_05\n And ask real people who are using real remote controls every day.\n\n0:20:14\tSPEAKER_05\n Or any other tool that is similar to a remote control, which basically is a small device that people don't may have with them.\n\n0:20:24\tSPEAKER_05\n Always like a phone.\n\n0:20:25\tSPEAKER_05\n We can use the phone as a good example of where to be inspired.\n\n0:20:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Of course, those who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired, because in fact, they are not only watching the trends.\n\n0:20:43\tSPEAKER_05\n They are inventing it.\n\n0:20:45\tSPEAKER_05\n They are creating the trend.\n\n0:20:47\tSPEAKER_05\n I hope I'm going to try to help you on that.\n\n0:20:51\tSPEAKER_05\n This is more risky because you're not following the trend.\n\n0:20:53\tSPEAKER_05\n You try to invent it, which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business.\n\n0:21:02\tSPEAKER_05\n So anyway, next slide please.\n\n0:21:06\tSPEAKER_05\n To be quick, there's a lot of words here, but basically, in the market of remote controls, there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to.\n\n0:21:20\tSPEAKER_05\n The first one, which seems to be the most important one, is that it has to be fancy.\n\n0:21:26\tSPEAKER_05\n It has to have a fancy look and feel.\n\n0:21:28\tSPEAKER_05\n And interestingly, this is the very most important thing.\n\n0:21:31\tSPEAKER_05\n It has to be fancy.\n\n0:21:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Strangely enough, it's more important to be fancy than to be with, and now that's the second thing it has to be, it has to be technologically innovative.\n\n0:21:42\tSPEAKER_05\n It has to be new with some of the new technology inside.\n\n0:21:50\tSPEAKER_05\n And this is also more important than the last thing, which we may think that would have been the most important, which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control. So as you see, it first has to be very nice, something that people are proud of that it can be identified with.\n\n0:22:15\tSPEAKER_05\n And then, something that contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends, my mind has this and not yours.\n\n0:22:25\tSPEAKER_05\n And finally, of course, it has to be useful as a remote control, but it seems that it's not so important that it's used to this remote control.\n\n0:22:34\tSPEAKER_05\n Next slide, please.\n\n0:22:37\tSPEAKER_05\n Now, in a more general, broad way of seeing the thing, if we look back and not look at only remote controls, I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas.\n\n0:22:53\tSPEAKER_05\n So currently, the trends that we see in big cities like Paris and Milan, well, it seems that this year things should have a fruit and vegetable way of the of lucar, fuel, so I think of course it applies to everything. That's the thing with trends.\n\n0:23:18\tSPEAKER_05\n It can travel from cloth to furniture, same idea, fruit and vegetable, think fruit and vegetable.\n\n0:23:29\tSPEAKER_05\n And if we compare to last year, now it has to be spongy.\n\n0:23:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, so I think when we were talking about rubber, I think the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess.\n\n0:23:53\tSPEAKER_02\n So maybe titanium is not a good idea.\n\n0:23:56\tSPEAKER_00\n Seems not. We need to think about, yeah.\n\n0:24:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Sorry Mark.\n\n0:24:06\tSPEAKER_05\n Think more of something in the colors of fruits and vegetables and spongy.\n\n0:24:12\tSPEAKER_05\n Even in the shape.\n\n0:24:13\tSPEAKER_05\n Even in the shape, it has to be more round and more look natural somehow.\n\n0:24:24\tSPEAKER_05\n And not those futuristic remote controls with angles and titanium like.\n\n0:24:31\tSPEAKER_05\n So that's what people seem to do.\n\n0:24:33\tSPEAKER_05\n I know it's quite far from what you thought but that's fashion man.\n\n0:24:46\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, that's all I had to say.\n\n0:24:48\tSPEAKER_02\n Do you have questions?\n\n0:24:49\tSPEAKER_00\n So these updates are merely addressed by people or it's...\n\n0:24:56\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm sorry.\n\n0:24:57\tSPEAKER_00\n You got some update, fashion updates.\n\n0:25:00\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, we have people listening to the trends everywhere in the world of course.\n\n0:25:06\tSPEAKER_05\n Our company is quite big and so I'm just asking them whether the current trends are according to them when they go in the stores, when they ask their friends that are also...\n\n0:25:19\tSPEAKER_00\n It's more general trend, it's not particular to the more...\n\n0:25:22\tSPEAKER_05\n No, it's not this, this is very general.\n\n0:25:24\tSPEAKER_05\n But it seems that trends travel across things.\n\n0:25:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, but some materials there to be...\n\n0:25:35\tSPEAKER_00\n There to be something like solid, they can't be really respond to you.\n\n0:25:39\tSPEAKER_05\n I think we have to have the look of the vegetables.\n\n0:25:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, yeah, at least that's...\n\n0:25:44\tSPEAKER_05\n We still have to put our chips inside.\n\n0:25:45\tSPEAKER_05\n So of course, this is your problem.\n\n0:25:50\tSPEAKER_05\n This is not mine.\n\n0:25:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, looking through these teams can be easily incorporated.\n\n0:25:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I think in the colors or the kind of...\n\n0:25:59\tSPEAKER_05\n If it's something like rubber made or...\n\n0:26:03\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, I think it's also going to be good.\n\n0:26:08\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:26:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:26:12\tSPEAKER_02\n Another question?\n\n0:26:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, thanks.\n\n0:26:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, so we will have next meeting in 30 minutes again.\n\n0:26:35\tSPEAKER_02\n And now you have to concentrate on this individual action, which is...\n\n0:26:40\tSPEAKER_02\n Which are for Rama...\n\n0:26:43\tSPEAKER_00\n You can fill the...\n\n0:26:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Design, Mark, the user interface design, and Sami, the product evaluation.\n\n0:26:55\tSPEAKER_02\n You will work together on a new, on a prototype using Modelling Clay.\n\n0:27:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Sounds interesting.\n\n0:27:04\tSPEAKER_02\n And I, as always, your personal coach will send you a specific instruction.\n\n0:27:15\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:27:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Thanks.\n\n0:27:19\tSPEAKER_00\n So can we highlight the specific features of all the...\n\n0:27:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, you're right.\n\n0:27:24\tSPEAKER_00\n You have to.\n\n0:27:26\tSPEAKER_00\n So we want the speech recognition and we want some kind of buttons and we want some teams like fruits or vegetables.\n\n0:27:37\tSPEAKER_00\n We also follow the general trend, spongy.\n\n0:27:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Do we agree on that?\n\n0:27:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:45\tSPEAKER_02\n We have to.\n\n0:27:46\tSPEAKER_04\n So do you think...\n\n0:27:47\tSPEAKER_04\n So we have to...\n\n0:27:48\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, no, we don't have to.\n\n0:27:50\tSPEAKER_05\n Seems it's the trend.\n\n0:27:51\tSPEAKER_05\n Again, as I said, we can also try to make it.\n\n0:27:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes, so we hear the trend.\n\n0:27:56\tSPEAKER_04\n So there's no...\n\n0:27:57\tSPEAKER_04\n Are we confident enough on creating trends?\n\n0:27:59\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, that's you can try to convince us.\n\n0:28:03\tSPEAKER_04\n Wow.\n\n0:28:05\tSPEAKER_04\n We can make it smell like fruit.\n\n0:28:07\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:28:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, that's good idea.\n\n0:28:11\tSPEAKER_02\n So titanium smells like fruits.\n\n0:28:16\tSPEAKER_00\n So what about location and these people are really interesting on those features?\n\n0:28:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Or they really...\n\n0:28:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Like...\n\n0:28:25\tSPEAKER_00\n There are more...\n\n0:28:26\tSPEAKER_00\n One of these fancy features.\n\n0:28:28\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, it's again in this...\n\n0:28:31\tSPEAKER_05\n In what I said, first it has to be fancy.\n\n0:28:33\tSPEAKER_05\n So I think if nobody else provides currently remote control, that kind of feature.\n\n0:28:39\tSPEAKER_05\n And if we can provide it, I think it's a good sell for us.\n\n0:28:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Because we have it on other stones.\n\n0:28:45\tSPEAKER_05\n It's fancy.\n\n0:28:46\tSPEAKER_05\n Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important.\n\n0:28:49\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:50\tSPEAKER_02\n I agree with you.\n\n0:28:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Is this it?\n\n0:28:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Now we have to decide on what kind of fancy this.\n\n0:28:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Do we take titanium smelling like fruit?\n\n0:29:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Or do we make spongy, fruity like?\n\n0:29:06\tSPEAKER_00\n We will try to explore these two up.\n\n0:29:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe we can explore them too.\n\n0:29:10\tSPEAKER_04\n Could we make a titanium shape?\n\n0:29:13\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, yeah, at least we're looking for a panel.\n\n0:29:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Don't you say that you cannot do double shaped...\n\n0:29:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, it's a curved shape.\n\n0:29:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, let's say we have to look for alternatives and...\n\n0:29:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, okay.\n\n0:29:29\tSPEAKER_00\n We have to see whether rubber is expensive and...\n\n0:29:33\tSPEAKER_04\n In fact, I just agree to make...\n\n0:29:36\tSPEAKER_04\n To make like, to tan your panels...\n\n0:29:39\tSPEAKER_04\n On a whole rubber body.\n\n0:29:45\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, okay.\n\n0:29:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, so you explore now that you're going to work together...\n\n0:29:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:50\tSPEAKER_02\n These two...\n\n0:29:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Or spongy and...\n\n0:29:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe we can have two different decasembley, also like one spongy and one kind of titanium.\n\n0:30:01\tSPEAKER_00\n But instead, we have only the plastic or that...\n\n0:30:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Of course, you have some.\n\n0:30:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, fiber, chips or...\n\n0:30:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I don't think...\n\n0:30:09\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we have to choose...\n\n0:30:11\tSPEAKER_02\n If we choose titanium or if we choose spongy, but it cannot be...\n\n0:30:15\tSPEAKER_04\n I really don't like this model in clay, because you know, it makes some rounds for...\n\n0:30:20\tSPEAKER_04\n I don't know.\n\n0:30:21\tSPEAKER_04\n For creation.\n\n0:30:22\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:23\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, look.\n\n0:30:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, you can't really...\n\n0:30:27\tSPEAKER_02\n You can't really say...\n\n0:30:28\tSPEAKER_02\n It's titanium.\n\n0:30:30\tSPEAKER_05\n You can paint it after work.\n\n0:30:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, we have a very large department of...\n\n0:30:37\tSPEAKER_02\n But don't worry, you...\n\n0:30:39\tSPEAKER_02\n You will do it.\n\n0:30:40\tSPEAKER_02\n You speak with...\n\n0:30:41\tSPEAKER_04\n All right, all right.\n\n0:30:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:30:44\tSPEAKER_02\n So, explore a shape.\n\n0:30:51\tSPEAKER_00\n So, still we want to keep LCD or...\n\n0:30:55\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's what we say that we have a new CD with information.\n\n0:30:59\tSPEAKER_02\n How?\n\n0:31:00\tSPEAKER_05\n The thing is that if we want to have...\n\n0:31:02\tSPEAKER_05\n As he says, if we want to have a...\n\n0:31:04\tSPEAKER_05\n A small number of buttons, Yeah, then we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are.\n\n0:31:11\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, that user friendly.\n\n0:31:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:13\tSPEAKER_05\n That's the converse to having the zillions of buttons where each button does only one thing.\n\n0:31:19\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:24\tSPEAKER_00\n And we just stick with two batteries, so it's not any...\n\n0:31:27\tSPEAKER_00\n So, we stick on it.\n\n0:31:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Classic, we stick classic on it.\n\n0:31:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:31:30\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, we don't reinvent the wheels.\n\n0:31:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Anyway, it's very...\n\n0:31:35\tSPEAKER_05\n In general, I think people change TV more often than batteries of their remote control.\n\n0:31:39\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh.\n\n0:31:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Because the trend goes faster than the life of the...\n\n0:31:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:31:54\tSPEAKER_02\n How are we?\n\n0:31:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, we're done.\n\n0:31:55\tSPEAKER_00\n We're done.\n\n0:31:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, so see you in 30 minutes.\n\n0:32:27\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "Sebaiklah, pemburu cukiri yang sudah kita pula
