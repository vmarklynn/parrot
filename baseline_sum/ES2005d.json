You did spot the back.\n\n0:00:14\tSPEAKER_01\n No?\n\n0:00:15\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:00:16\tSPEAKER_02\n It doesn't look as good as it is.\n\n0:00:19\tSPEAKER_00\n It's pretty cool.\n\n0:00:20\tSPEAKER_00\n You look kind of like Rambo.\n\n0:00:23\tSPEAKER_00\n I think.\n\n0:00:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Hold on.\n\n0:00:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Let's play the game.\n\n0:00:26\tSPEAKER_02\n I think this way can't fall off.\n\n0:00:33\tNone\n I think that's...\n\n0:00:34\tNone\n Well, go on, follow me.\n\n0:00:38\tNone\n I like that.\n\n0:00:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:00:43\tSPEAKER_03\n I'll use the powerpoint.\n\n0:00:48\tSPEAKER_03\n How was that?\n\n0:00:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Was that fun?\n\n0:00:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:00:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Very fun.\n\n0:00:53\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:00:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, I forgot to mail you the minutes, but I will do.\n\n0:01:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Oops, Daisy.\n\n0:01:03\tSPEAKER_03\n We...\n\n0:01:07\tSPEAKER_03\n All right.\n\n0:01:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:01:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Someone gets a pen.\n\n0:01:14\tSPEAKER_03\n All right.\n\n0:01:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, you guys are first with your prototype.\n\n0:01:23\tSPEAKER_03\n I probably get to make good news.\n\n0:01:26\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, there's goodness.\n\n0:01:31\tSPEAKER_03\n You have budget problems.\n\n0:01:34\tSPEAKER_03\n The refrigerator will suck.\n\n0:01:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Oops.\n\n0:01:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:01:55\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:01:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Have you got a presentation to make?\n\n0:02:02\tSPEAKER_03\n No, I'm not making it.\n\n0:02:05\tSPEAKER_02\n You're sure?\n\n0:02:07\tSPEAKER_02\n May we share?\n\n0:02:08\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm just going to camera.\n\n0:02:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:02:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Sure.\n\n0:02:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:02:12\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:02:15\tSPEAKER_00\n We made three for you.\n\n0:02:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Three.\n\n0:02:19\tSPEAKER_00\n One space on the banana, one space on the tomato, and the other one.\n\n0:02:26\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not talking.\n\n0:02:28\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm talking.\n\n0:02:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:02:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, yeah.\n\n0:02:32\tSPEAKER_00\n We had some red left over.\n\n0:02:33\tSPEAKER_00\n I see, okay.\n\n0:02:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:02:36\tSPEAKER_00\n So this is the non-button one, or as few buttons as possible.\n\n0:02:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Mainly, speak recognition.\n\n0:02:44\tSPEAKER_00\n The yellow there is the slogan that we need to incorporate.\n\n0:02:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Very simple.\n\n0:02:50\tSPEAKER_00\n If you do need buttons, you can flip it over and the sun's there.\n\n0:02:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:02:55\tSPEAKER_00\n But mainly is speak recognition.\n\n0:02:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:02:59\tSPEAKER_03\n So the buttons would be like individual users.\n\n0:03:01\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:03:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Or, yeah, they might project things onto the screen, which you can do on there.\n\n0:03:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, okay.\n\n0:03:08\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm not sure about that.\n\n0:03:11\tSPEAKER_00\n And this one is the one, more like the one that we looked at earlier.\n\n0:03:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:03:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, you guys can.\n\n0:03:17\tSPEAKER_00\n That's great.\n\n0:03:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:03:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:03:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Gaming.\n\n0:03:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, like the feeling.\n\n0:03:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, sure.\n\n0:03:25\tSPEAKER_00\n That one is...\n\n0:03:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, no, it's delicate.\n\n0:03:28\tSPEAKER_00\n It's the ear.\n\n0:03:30\tSPEAKER_00\n It's already got it stand, that one, that's it stand.\n\n0:03:33\tSPEAKER_00\n It does also lie flat, but that's the yellow stand there represents the charging stand.\n\n0:03:40\tSPEAKER_00\n The black on the back is the slogan.\n\n0:03:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, nice and obvious.\n\n0:03:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, that one...\n\n0:03:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, we did think of that.\n\n0:03:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, if it's standing up, it's on there.\n\n0:03:52\tSPEAKER_00\n But also, we're going to have the company name on the front, which is the little black kind of line in the middle.\n\n0:03:57\tSPEAKER_00\n All right.\n\n0:03:58\tSPEAKER_00\n So, and that's the transmissivity, LED thing.\n\n0:04:03\tSPEAKER_00\n These are the two scroll ones that we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down.\n\n0:04:09\tSPEAKER_00\n We weren't sure about putting them there because it's kind of could get bad.\n\n0:04:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, yeah, where you're holding it, kind of.\n\n0:04:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, well, if you hold it, you can...\n\n0:04:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, you can hold it.\n\n0:04:21\tSPEAKER_00\n It does actually feel quite ergonomic if you've got small hands.\n\n0:04:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Obviously, I don't think that's real sized thing.\n\n0:04:29\tSPEAKER_00\n It would have to be a bit bigger.\n\n0:04:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:04:32\tSPEAKER_00\n That's a speaker at the top, so you can speak into it like a little walkie talkie as well, to speak recognition.\n\n0:04:39\tSPEAKER_00\n And then the buttons, kind of self-explanatory, just buttons, whatever you need them, try to keep it simple.\n\n0:04:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Or that's the charging base prongs at the bottom.\n\n0:04:51\tSPEAKER_00\n We used those tools to try to that.\n\n0:04:54\tSPEAKER_00\n And then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one.\n\n0:05:00\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not in the traditional place, but it's quite obvious.\n\n0:05:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Excellent.\n\n0:05:06\tSPEAKER_00\n So, there we go.\n\n0:05:09\tSPEAKER_00\n And we have the banana, based one, too.\n\n0:05:14\tSPEAKER_02\n I suppose for the younger audiences.\n\n0:05:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_02\n A more friendly, so Barney the banana.\n\n0:05:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Right, right.\n\n0:05:24\tSPEAKER_02\n It's to induce more television watching, but it's absolutely just what you need.\n\n0:05:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:30\tSPEAKER_03\n So, it's a lock in the hands banana.\n\n0:05:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:05:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Cool.\n\n0:05:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Wow.\n\n0:05:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, nice to have options, at least.\n\n0:05:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:05:43\tSPEAKER_00\n So, are there any improvements or issues or...?\n\n0:05:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, there are issues.\n\n0:05:49\tSPEAKER_02\n And there are a lot of downwinds.\n\n0:05:52\tSPEAKER_03\n And main problem that we have, unfortunately, being finance.\n\n0:05:58\tSPEAKER_03\n And I says entering the evaluation criteria.\n\n0:06:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Unfortunately, the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll button.\n\n0:06:11\tSPEAKER_03\n It's going to cost us 14.6 euros.\n\n0:06:16\tSPEAKER_03\n So, we have to re-elect, sorry, I accidentally highlighted somehow.\n\n0:06:23\tSPEAKER_03\n There we go.\n\n0:06:26\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, God, why is it not doing that?\n\n0:06:31\tSPEAKER_03\n There we go.\n\n0:06:35\tSPEAKER_03\n So, basically, in order to save our two euros, I was thinking that we could have a sense of the same shape, but just have it flattened.\n\n0:06:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I could just normally make control.\n\n0:06:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I mean, it's already got a kind of cool shape, so it wouldn't have to be curved in and out.\n\n0:07:02\tSPEAKER_03\n And by doing so, I don't know, hold on, doesn't save us quite as much.\n\n0:07:08\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know what's going on with this again.\n\n0:07:10\tSPEAKER_02\n What was the double curves of two of them?\n\n0:07:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, good point.\n\n0:07:17\tSPEAKER_01\n And...\n\n0:07:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Double curve on both sides?\n\n0:07:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, this is double curve.\n\n0:07:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Sure, curve.\n\n0:07:26\tSPEAKER_01\n This is double curve.\n\n0:07:27\tSPEAKER_01\n This one is single curve.\n\n0:07:29\tSPEAKER_01\n This is single curve.\n\n0:07:31\tSPEAKER_01\n This is curve on both sides.\n\n0:07:33\tSPEAKER_01\n So, double curve.\n\n0:07:34\tSPEAKER_03\n No, I think it means double curve doesn't...\n\n0:07:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Like an S shape.\n\n0:07:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Like a...\n\n0:07:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Sure, it's got a single curve on that bottom here.\n\n0:07:43\tSPEAKER_03\n And the double curve would be if it was that similar curve on it.\n\n0:07:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, I might be wrong with that.\n\n0:07:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Like this one curve on this side?\n\n0:07:51\tSPEAKER_01\n One curve on that side?\n\n0:07:52\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't think that counts as a curve, I think.\n\n0:07:54\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, it's just a shape.\n\n0:07:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:07:56\tSPEAKER_03\n The curvature is like the case.\n\n0:07:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay, that's the biggest expense.\n\n0:08:02\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I don't know why I've got it too.\n\n0:08:04\tSPEAKER_03\n I can't seem to select anymore.\n\n0:08:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:08:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, we can work around that.\n\n0:08:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:08:13\tSPEAKER_02\n What do you think it should be one?\n\n0:08:18\tSPEAKER_03\n It's meant to be one.\n\n0:08:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I don't know why I've got it too.\n\n0:08:21\tSPEAKER_03\n But I'll don't tell if I find it.\n\n0:08:23\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a Sheft button.\n\n0:08:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe stuck again.\n\n0:08:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:08:29\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a Sheft button.\n\n0:08:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, so take away three, which would give us...\n\n0:08:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, that's fine.\n\n0:08:40\tSPEAKER_03\n So, 11 euros, 60.\n\n0:08:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Cool.\n\n0:08:46\tSPEAKER_00\n So we could even add something.\n\n0:08:48\tSPEAKER_03\n We could quite have the scroll wheel, unfortunately.\n\n0:08:52\tSPEAKER_02\n What?\n\n0:08:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Fire the accountants.\n\n0:08:55\tNone\n Hey.\n\n0:08:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, look at that.\n\n0:09:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Thanks.\n\n0:09:04\tSPEAKER_02\n If you click back in that bottom right saw, or you're starting from...\n\n0:09:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, just extends as well.\n\n0:09:11\tSPEAKER_01\n You can do one thing.\n\n0:09:14\tSPEAKER_01\n You just select one box outside.\n\n0:09:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, this works.\n\n0:09:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Then move it with the help of this.\n\n0:09:21\tSPEAKER_01\n One of the boxes is stuck.\n\n0:09:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Just a minute.\n\n0:09:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:09:28\tSPEAKER_01\n Now move it like this.\n\n0:09:32\tSPEAKER_03\n It's not like the Sheft button.\n\n0:09:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Should we ask a word technical?\n\n0:09:39\tSPEAKER_01\n It's for it, Melissa.\n\n0:09:41\tSPEAKER_03\n That's fine.\n\n0:09:42\tSPEAKER_03\n We've worked out what it would be anyway.\n\n0:09:45\tSPEAKER_02\n Did you try both Sheft buttons?\n\n0:09:47\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:09:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, so...\n\n0:09:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, that's today.\n\n0:09:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, no way.\n\n0:09:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Right, so that's finances.\n\n0:10:02\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know what we...\n\n0:10:03\tSPEAKER_03\n What could we do at Wreck and Wicked Ad?\n\n0:10:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, maybe we could add something, but maybe if...\n\n0:10:10\tSPEAKER_00\n I suppose that's our...\n\n0:10:12\tSPEAKER_00\n We might say that we've got.\n\n0:10:14\tSPEAKER_00\n So...\n\n0:10:15\tSPEAKER_00\n If we're happy with designers, they're in place for any money.\n\n0:10:17\tSPEAKER_00\n If we don't have to.\n\n0:10:18\tSPEAKER_00\n But if there is anything you think we've missed out there, then you feel free to add it.\n\n0:10:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe...\n\n0:10:24\tSPEAKER_00\n I mean, obviously it would be bigger, so there might be more space for the slogan on the front.\n\n0:10:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Because it's not an ideal place right now.\n\n0:10:32\tSPEAKER_03\n So that's...\n\n0:10:33\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, so project version.\n\n0:10:35\tSPEAKER_03\n We have under 12, that year is 50.\n\n0:10:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Project process.\n\n0:10:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Everything that went...\n\n0:10:42\tSPEAKER_03\n We're happy.\n\n0:10:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:10:44\tSPEAKER_02\n I think we have a winning product.\n\n0:10:49\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:10:52\tSPEAKER_03\n That you're eating something.\n\n0:10:59\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it went quite smoothly.\n\n0:11:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Room for creativity.\n\n0:11:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Will we be happy with that?\n\n0:11:08\tSPEAKER_00\n I think we're very creative.\n\n0:11:10\tSPEAKER_03\n No, I think it means sort of individually.\n\n0:11:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Oh, right, okay.\n\n0:11:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, no, maybe.\n\n0:11:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, gravy.\n\n0:11:18\tSPEAKER_03\n So we're just going to...\n\n0:11:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, okay.\n\n0:11:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Teamwork leadership, sorry.\n\n0:11:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Absolutely leadership.\n\n0:11:25\tSPEAKER_03\n You're all getting a raise.\n\n0:11:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Teamwork.\n\n0:11:29\tSPEAKER_03\n I thought, well, yeah.\n\n0:11:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:11:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Everyone got enough input, I think.\n\n0:11:34\tSPEAKER_03\n And, well, means, yeah.\n\n0:11:36\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, we use...\n\n0:11:37\tSPEAKER_03\n That's a cool stuff, it's brilliant.\n\n0:11:40\tSPEAKER_03\n That's five more.\n\n0:11:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Right.\n\n0:11:43\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know what new ideas find means, to be honest.\n\n0:11:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, these are new ideas like glow in the dark or something like that.\n\n0:11:51\tSPEAKER_01\n We discussed all the new ideas, but of course we couldn't reach any proper goals.\n\n0:11:55\tSPEAKER_01\n So we couldn't use these latest ones, but we are using these scroll buttons like this.\n\n0:12:00\tSPEAKER_01\n These are new ideas, new shapes, everything.\n\n0:12:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Atleast.\n\n0:12:05\tSPEAKER_03\n So just general thumbs up for all of us.\n\n0:12:08\tSPEAKER_03\n That kind of, unfortunately, is too quick.\n\n0:12:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:12:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Well...\n\n0:12:15\tSPEAKER_03\n I suppose, yeah.\n\n0:12:18\tSPEAKER_02\n So let's talk about our bonuses and raises.\n\n0:12:22\tSPEAKER_03\n I think another couple of days, holiday pay, maybe, well in order for all of you.\n\n0:12:29\tSPEAKER_03\n Let's see if we can get this.\n\n0:12:32\tSPEAKER_02\n What do you think?\n\n0:12:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Whoops.\n\n0:12:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe we should start cleaning up the play.\n\n0:12:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:12:37\tSPEAKER_03\n So, does it go back in?\n\n0:12:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Reusable.\n\n0:12:40\tSPEAKER_00\n I see, maybe something like that.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Something should not be the one.\n\n0:12:45\tSPEAKER_03\n It's really, really annoying.\n\n0:12:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Have you finished?\n\n0:12:50\tSPEAKER_01\n I have.\n\n0:12:52\tSPEAKER_01\n My needs also there.\n\n0:12:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Atleast, my needs also there.\n\n0:12:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Presentation.\n\n0:12:57\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:12:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, you've got more.\n\n0:12:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, you've got a presentation.\n\n0:13:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:13:01\tSPEAKER_03\n It didn't bother to tell me that.\n\n0:13:03\tSPEAKER_03\n That's the thing.\n\n0:13:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Is it?\n\n0:13:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:13:08\tSPEAKER_03\n It doesn't tell me.\n\n0:13:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Is the projective-eliverted that is my man?\n\n0:13:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, you're doing it.\n\n0:13:15\tSPEAKER_03\n We're going to value it ourselves.\n\n0:13:17\tSPEAKER_03\n We thought we were great.\n\n0:13:18\tSPEAKER_00\n I love to be that now.\n\n0:13:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Kind of a green banana now.\n\n0:13:30\tSPEAKER_00\n It's this as well.\n\n0:13:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Sorry, we've got to mention we've made out of kind of a rubbery latex new material that we've got.\n\n0:13:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, hey, I'm on.\n\n0:13:44\tSPEAKER_02\n I've got that.\n\n0:13:51\tNone\n It's too, too.\n\n0:13:52\tSPEAKER_03\n I wonder what's out there.\n\n0:13:55\tNone\n It's too.\n\n0:14:03\tSPEAKER_02\n It's supposed to touch.\n\n0:14:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:28\tSPEAKER_02\n So.\n\n0:14:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:14:37\tSPEAKER_01\n So now is the final evaluation, final evaluation of the of our product.\n\n0:14:42\tSPEAKER_01\n How we are going to means at what standard, what standard, whether it means our standards or not.\n\n0:14:50\tSPEAKER_01\n How much rating we will give to these products.\n\n0:14:53\tSPEAKER_01\n So of course, this will be a teamwork.\n\n0:14:55\tSPEAKER_01\n We together have to decide what rating we will give to this product and everything.\n\n0:15:01\tSPEAKER_01\n But methodology, I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this.\n\n0:15:07\tSPEAKER_01\n We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements.\n\n0:15:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Whether it means the user requirements or not, this product then trends.\n\n0:15:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Whether it is as per the latest fashion trends or not.\n\n0:15:21\tSPEAKER_01\n It means because we have already studied that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays.\n\n0:15:28\tSPEAKER_01\n So this is also an important factor, five-valuation also.\n\n0:15:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Then marketing strategy of the company as we have already discussed that our company is quite reputable in the market.\n\n0:15:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Not only in terms of providing quality products, not only in providing latest technologies, but also in terms of providing environmental.\n\n0:15:49\tSPEAKER_01\n But also in terms of providing environmental safer products.\n\n0:15:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Keeping in mind all these safety issues.\n\n0:16:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Now comes the criteria rating with 7 points scale.\n\n0:16:07\tSPEAKER_01\n I am having this scale, this scale.\n\n0:16:11\tSPEAKER_01\n So we have to do it on a board.\n\n0:16:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:16:22\tSPEAKER_02\n Do we have the market reward?\n\n0:16:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Thank you.\n\n0:16:32\tSPEAKER_01\n So.\n\n0:16:55\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:17:05\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:17:34\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:18:02\tSPEAKER_01\n So these are the three criteria for evaluation of our product.\n\n0:18:09\tSPEAKER_01\n First of all comes user requirement.\n\n0:18:12\tSPEAKER_01\n So we will see whether this product means all user requirements or not.\n\n0:18:18\tSPEAKER_01\n I would first like to have your views.\n\n0:18:20\tSPEAKER_01\n What do you think?\n\n0:18:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Whether you made so user requirements or not?\n\n0:18:26\tSPEAKER_00\n I think it did.\n\n0:18:33\tSPEAKER_00\n It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the new technology that people said they wanted.\n\n0:18:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Does it work?\n\n0:18:45\tSPEAKER_00\n So what rating you will personally?\n\n0:18:57\tSPEAKER_01\n One is highest ranking.\n\n0:19:00\tSPEAKER_01\n But I think highest ranking is 7 or 1.\n\n0:19:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:19:07\tSPEAKER_01\n So it's one from your point of view.\n\n0:19:17\tSPEAKER_02\n It's hard to know.\n\n0:19:21\tSPEAKER_01\n You can tell on the like I think she has given her views on the basis of design because she was a very interface expert.\n\n0:19:29\tSPEAKER_01\n But you can give your views based on technology whether the technology means the requirements of the customers or not.\n\n0:19:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I think it might even exceed it.\n\n0:19:41\tSPEAKER_02\n But I guess there's kind of a shortage of buttons.\n\n0:19:47\tSPEAKER_01\n See, I'm going to give it a two.\n\n0:19:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Two.\n\n0:19:51\tSPEAKER_01\n And what about you, Brian?\n\n0:19:54\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it's a good question.\n\n0:20:00\tSPEAKER_01\n For me personally, it is everything fine.\n\n0:20:03\tSPEAKER_01\n It may be having good design.\n\n0:20:05\tSPEAKER_01\n It may be meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology wise, price wise.\n\n0:20:10\tSPEAKER_01\n But there's one thing which limits the customers.\n\n0:20:13\tSPEAKER_01\n We are having only two or three designs.\n\n0:20:15\tSPEAKER_01\n We are having one banana design.\n\n0:20:17\tSPEAKER_01\n And the other one is orange.\n\n0:20:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, like.\n\n0:20:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, orange.\n\n0:20:24\tSPEAKER_01\n And the third one is what you get that is not of a fruit look.\n\n0:20:27\tSPEAKER_01\n But if a person doesn't like banana or orange, you are limiting him.\n\n0:20:32\tSPEAKER_01\n No, don't buy our product because we are we like this only.\n\n0:20:36\tSPEAKER_01\n So we are showing our preference for particular fruits two or three kinds.\n\n0:20:40\tSPEAKER_01\n And.\n\n0:20:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Freedest.\n\n0:20:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Is that not trans?\n\n0:20:46\tSPEAKER_01\n No, personally as a marketing expert, I don't believe that because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits, they give a range of products range of shapes.\n\n0:20:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Like if we see look at the smallest thing, tofist chocolates, they give a variety of different things.\n\n0:21:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Some children like to buy banana shapes, some apple shapes, some even pineapple shape, some orange shape.\n\n0:21:07\tSPEAKER_01\n So you can't know means what shape a person will like.\n\n0:21:11\tSPEAKER_01\n So in this case, giving only one or two choices, we are limiting our customers.\n\n0:21:16\tSPEAKER_01\n And by limiting them, we are limiting our sales, limiting our profit also.\n\n0:21:20\tSPEAKER_00\n But in electronics, I think it's not always quite so.\n\n0:21:25\tSPEAKER_00\n You don't always have so many choices is with chocolates.\n\n0:21:28\tSPEAKER_00\n I think, you know, if you're going to buy a TV, maybe a company will have.\n\n0:21:33\tSPEAKER_00\n That you're going to choose from a company will have two or three choices, but they're different designs will come up with one product.\n\n0:21:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe okay, but I will, I will personally won't give it training beyond three.\n\n0:21:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:21:52\tSPEAKER_01\n So we can, yeah, on average, we can think three, four, seven, maybe three or four.\n\n0:22:04\tSPEAKER_01\n No, sorry, it should be.\n\n0:22:07\tSPEAKER_02\n What are we doing?\n\n0:22:10\tSPEAKER_01\n No, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, we are doing very wrong things.\n\n0:22:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, yeah, we are taking every and that's I have taken it very wrongly.\n\n0:22:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, three, four, four, two, six, seven, seven.\n\n0:22:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, one by exactly. So we can say one or two.\n\n0:22:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:22:24\tSPEAKER_01\n And because it is one point eight, just reaching two, so we will do two.\n\n0:22:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, yeah.\n\n0:22:31\tSPEAKER_01\n So, what about the trends?\n\n0:22:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Can you explain what you want us to write them?\n\n0:22:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Sorry.\n\n0:22:38\tSPEAKER_02\n How, how conforms to the current trends?\n\n0:22:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, again, the fresh and trends, this also like, whether it will be fashionable to have these products in the, in the fruit shape or something.\n\n0:22:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:22:51\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, going on the specifications that we had that fruit and vegetables are quite popular, and that people like something that is good to look at, and not many buttons, I would give it, well, because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at, that it looks cool, you know?\n\n0:23:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Why would actually give it a three, three or four, not sure, three or three?\n\n0:23:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:23:24\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:23:25\tSPEAKER_02\n As far as the technology, it's got the latest trends in speech technology, but it's missing the screen, as you said.\n\n0:23:34\tSPEAKER_02\n It does have push buttons, or the scroll buttons, but doesn't have that fancy solar power, the vibrating energy mechanisms.\n\n0:23:45\tSPEAKER_02\n I give it a four, I give it kind of middle of the road for technology.\n\n0:23:52\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I'm sort of pretty, just the fruit does me in, I mean, maybe trained it to some, but I'm just not swollen the fruit.\n\n0:24:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Also, I would like to see Nancy D screen in it.\n\n0:24:09\tSPEAKER_03\n So yeah, I'd say about fours.\n\n0:24:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:24:16\tSPEAKER_01\n Personally, I think that in terms of trends, these products are quite good, like these products are in fruit shape, because that people now, our fashion trend shows that people like everything, everything is being advertised like closed shoes, and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables, or getting them some, or showing some association with them.\n\n0:24:42\tSPEAKER_01\n And in this way, our product is good.\n\n0:24:45\tSPEAKER_01\n And the second thing now, people don't want any complicated or bulky project, and our system is quite simple and quite handy.\n\n0:24:54\tSPEAKER_01\n So that also our product meets the trends of the market.\n\n0:25:01\tSPEAKER_01\n And yes, it is spongy also, so they can play with it, it's quite good.\n\n0:25:06\tSPEAKER_01\n So then I think maybe I can give it to, so for $4, $10, $13, $13, so we can, is it fine?\n\n0:25:20\tSPEAKER_01\n So what about company strategy?\n\n0:25:25\tSPEAKER_02\n See, I love it.\n\n0:25:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, the company strategy, okay.\n\n0:25:33\tSPEAKER_00\n There was a lot of discussing, it was good.\n\n0:25:36\tSPEAKER_00\n I feel like I got my say.\n\n0:25:39\tSPEAKER_00\n So I give the company strategy two.\n\n0:25:47\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's the remote control conforms to the company strategy.\n\n0:25:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Is that the question?\n\n0:25:54\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:25:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Is it okay?\n\n0:25:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so one or two?\n\n0:26:01\tSPEAKER_00\n What?\n\n0:26:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, just get it to its five.\n\n0:26:04\tSPEAKER_02\n I got it to.\n\n0:26:07\tSPEAKER_01\n So what about you, Brian?\n\n0:26:09\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, I pretty much kept the company strategy, so I would go for a...\n\n0:26:16\tSPEAKER_03\n One, as we know only kept it, but we were limited by it.\n\n0:26:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:26\tSPEAKER_01\n And me also, this product, this me, this me, this me, it's all company strategy, like a product should be as per customer's requirement, as per latest technology, and it should be environmental safe.\n\n0:26:41\tSPEAKER_01\n So since our product meets all these requirements, so I would also prefer to give it rank one.\n\n0:26:48\tSPEAKER_01\n So, four, six, six.\n\n0:26:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:52\tSPEAKER_01\n So we can say two or one?\n\n0:26:55\tSPEAKER_01\n Two.\n\n0:26:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, so...\n\n0:26:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Seven, seven.\n\n0:27:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Overall, we are getting two pensies, something, but we can round it as two.\n\n0:27:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:27:14\tSPEAKER_01\n So I think overall, evaluation of our product is quite good, so we can launch it.\n\n0:27:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Hey.\n\n0:27:31\tSPEAKER_03\n In which case, we are done.\n\n0:27:34\tSPEAKER_03\n We have evaluated and we are within budget.\n\n0:27:39\tSPEAKER_03\n Cool.\n\n0:27:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, so we're jumping lunch.\n\n0:27:41\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:42\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:27:43\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:27:44\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:27:45\tSPEAKER_03\n I've got a light.\n\n0:27:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:27:47\tSPEAKER_03\n What's being with that?\n\n0:27:49\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a fly after right up.\n\n0:27:51\tSPEAKER_02\n A couple more.\n\n0:27:52\tSPEAKER_02\n More forms, more.\n\n0:27:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n0:27:54\tSPEAKER_03\n I've got a report to write, so.\n\n0:27:57\tSPEAKER_02\n I like my job.\n\n0:28:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, with the client.\n\n0:28:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, can you...\n\n0:28:10\tSPEAKER_03\n About gender three.\n\n0:28:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Mine is there in...\n\n0:28:14\tNone\n There's a certain project.\n\n0:28:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, that's good.\n\n0:28:16\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:28:17\tSPEAKER_03\n Cool.\n\n0:28:18\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay, there it is.\n\n0:28:41\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm going to call to set the show to set the show on.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "SPEAKER and his friends are playing
