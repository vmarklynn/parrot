Are you ready?\n\n0:00:25\tSPEAKER_00\n You should put the laptop right into the square.\n\n0:00:29\tSPEAKER_00\n For the camera.\n\n0:00:30\tSPEAKER_00\n For the camera.\n\n0:00:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:00:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Good morning, Smelstein.\n\n0:00:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Good morning.\n\n0:00:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Mr. PN.\n\n0:00:36\tSPEAKER_02\n How are you today?\n\n0:00:38\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm fine.\n\n0:00:39\tSPEAKER_02\n How was your business trip to Boston?\n\n0:00:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, actually.\n\n0:00:43\tSPEAKER_00\n I didn't go.\n\n0:00:44\tSPEAKER_00\n I didn't feel like it.\n\n0:00:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Do you want to open it?\n\n0:00:48\tSPEAKER_00\n That's redownly.\n\n0:00:50\tSPEAKER_00\n I guess I should close it here.\n\n0:00:54\tSPEAKER_03\n You have the same message of Windows Connection.\n\n0:00:57\tSPEAKER_01\n I'm so happy to have a flight.\n\n0:00:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Oh, stand by.\n\n0:01:00\tSPEAKER_03\n Close the window.\n\n0:01:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay. The waiting is for our marketing expert.\n\n0:01:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Root.\n\n0:01:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Root.\n\n0:01:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Project.\n\n0:01:10\tSPEAKER_00\n Kick off.\n\n0:01:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Is there a schedule for this meeting?\n\n0:01:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes, there is.\n\n0:01:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Actually.\n\n0:01:16\tSPEAKER_00\n I will...\n\n0:01:18\tSPEAKER_00\n This is the agenda for today.\n\n0:01:20\tSPEAKER_00\n For this meeting.\n\n0:01:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Good morning, Root.\n\n0:01:27\tSPEAKER_00\n It's important.\n\n0:01:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Shall we close the door?\n\n0:01:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes. Great.\n\n0:01:34\tSPEAKER_00\n It's important that the laptops are exactly on the square.\n\n0:01:41\tSPEAKER_00\n For the cameras.\n\n0:01:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:01:57\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:01:58\tSPEAKER_00\n We're here to develop a new product.\n\n0:02:02\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it.\n\n0:02:08\tSPEAKER_00\n And this is the first meeting to generate some ideas about it.\n\n0:02:14\tSPEAKER_00\n Root.\n\n0:02:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Root is here as the marketing expert.\n\n0:02:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Root is here as the user interface designer.\n\n0:02:23\tSPEAKER_00\n And Sebastian is here in the role of industrial designer.\n\n0:02:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Is that correct?\n\n0:02:29\tSPEAKER_00\n That's correct.\n\n0:02:30\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:02:32\tSPEAKER_00\n We're going to do a little tool training for the tools we are going to use during the meetings we are going to have here.\n\n0:02:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan and we will have a discussion.\n\n0:02:51\tSPEAKER_00\n This meeting should take no more than 25 minutes.\n\n0:02:55\tSPEAKER_02\n So we should keep that in mind.\n\n0:02:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Is there any room for a little presentation?\n\n0:03:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe during the discussion?\n\n0:03:02\tSPEAKER_02\n There is.\n\n0:03:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, there is.\n\n0:03:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:03:05\tSPEAKER_00\n No problem.\n\n0:03:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, this new product we are going to develop.\n\n0:03:12\tSPEAKER_00\n It is remote control, a television remote control.\n\n0:03:17\tSPEAKER_00\n And first of all, it should be original, it should be trendy and user friendly.\n\n0:03:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Those are kind of easy goals.\n\n0:03:27\tSPEAKER_00\n And I am sure we can find more goals for the product we are going to develop.\n\n0:03:33\tSPEAKER_00\n We will discuss later on more ideas about how the remote should look and how it should function.\n\n0:03:41\tSPEAKER_00\n And all those kind of things.\n\n0:03:43\tSPEAKER_00\n The market.\n\n0:03:44\tSPEAKER_00\n We should have a look at the market.\n\n0:03:48\tSPEAKER_00\n We are going to use a project method during this development, which consists of three different design stages.\n\n0:03:59\tSPEAKER_00\n The functional design, the conceptual design and the detailed design.\n\n0:04:05\tSPEAKER_00\n All of these stages mean that we do some individual work, prepare, and then meet to discuss our...\n\n0:04:17\tSPEAKER_00\n The progressions?\n\n0:04:20\tSPEAKER_00\n The progressions, yes.\n\n0:04:23\tSPEAKER_00\n The first stage, the functional design, we are going to search for the user requirements.\n\n0:04:30\tSPEAKER_00\n And we will make a specification of that.\n\n0:04:38\tSPEAKER_00\n The second is the technical functional design.\n\n0:04:42\tSPEAKER_00\n What effect should the remote have?\n\n0:04:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, in this case, control the television, I think.\n\n0:04:51\tSPEAKER_00\n And the last one is the working design.\n\n0:04:53\tSPEAKER_00\n How exactly does it work in the technical sense?\n\n0:04:58\tSPEAKER_00\n The other design stages, we will discuss that later.\n\n0:05:03\tSPEAKER_00\n So we'll keep it with the functional design.\n\n0:05:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:05:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Before we think about remote control, we will work with some of the tools we have here.\n\n0:05:14\tSPEAKER_00\n As you see now, I can give a presentation.\n\n0:05:19\tSPEAKER_00\n It's also possible to use this one as well.\n\n0:05:22\tSPEAKER_00\n You can display two presentations as you want to.\n\n0:05:27\tSPEAKER_00\n To present it to show us a file, you'll need to place it in your project documents folder, which is on your desktop, at least it should be.\n\n0:05:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Then we have this electronic whiteboard system.\n\n0:05:48\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, I will show that now.\n\n0:05:52\tSPEAKER_00\n You can draw on the board using this pen.\n\n0:05:57\tSPEAKER_00\n There are little sensors, so do not grab it here with a little bit more to the end.\n\n0:06:06\tSPEAKER_00\n It's on the eraser now, so we click the pen button.\n\n0:06:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so not too fast writing.\n\n0:06:25\tSPEAKER_00\n You can insert a new slide or a whiteboard file by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button.\n\n0:06:39\tSPEAKER_00\n It's quite the same.\n\n0:06:41\tSPEAKER_00\n All our smartboard notes should be kept in the same file.\n\n0:06:50\tSPEAKER_00\n So do not make a new file, just use this one during the day.\n\n0:06:57\tSPEAKER_00\n You can use the eraser to make something go away.\n\n0:07:02\tSPEAKER_03\n We'll use the same whiteboard file.\n\n0:07:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:07:06\tSPEAKER_03\n We can work together on it while we're using it in the meetings.\n\n0:07:12\tSPEAKER_00\n In the meetings, only in the meetings.\n\n0:07:14\tSPEAKER_00\n It's really like the regular whiteboard.\n\n0:07:19\tSPEAKER_00\n You can choose the format.\n\n0:07:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Sorry.\n\n0:07:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Let me see.\n\n0:07:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, I guess it's maybe because I'm not ben selected.\n\n0:07:41\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:07:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Current color.\n\n0:07:44\tSPEAKER_00\n You can choose not a color.\n\n0:07:46\tSPEAKER_00\n For example, black and you can choose the line width.\n\n0:07:55\tSPEAKER_00\n So now I have a different line width and color.\n\n0:08:00\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay. Quite easy if you do have any questions.\n\n0:08:07\tSPEAKER_00\n I wrote down the documents should be in the project documents folder if you want to discuss it with us.\n\n0:08:15\tSPEAKER_00\n As a little training, I will ask Ruth first to draw your own animal on a new slide with a different color and a different line width.\n\n0:08:29\tSPEAKER_00\n Then the one now selected.\n\n0:08:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:08:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:08:56\tSPEAKER_01\n And then I'm all.\n\n0:08:59\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:09:06\tSPEAKER_03\n It's a bunny rabbit.\n\n0:09:14\tSPEAKER_00\n A rabbit.\n\n0:09:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:09:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, great.\n\n0:09:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Could you do the same, please?\n\n0:09:23\tSPEAKER_00\n Of course.\n\n0:09:24\tSPEAKER_00\n But a different animal with a different color and a different line width.\n\n0:09:29\tSPEAKER_00\n So, Sebastian is thinking about the animal.\n\n0:09:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Just guessing what should be my favorite animal.\n\n0:09:35\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:09:36\tSPEAKER_03\n I'm thinking about it too.\n\n0:09:39\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:09:46\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, it looked more than a bunny than a cat, but it works, right?\n\n0:10:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:10:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:10:18\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:10:45\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm guessing a horse.\n\n0:10:55\tSPEAKER_03\n With a very small legs.\n\n0:11:01\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm not very good in drawing.\n\n0:11:03\tSPEAKER_03\n You should feed that to the animal.\n\n0:11:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I guess you get the ID.\n\n0:11:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:11:19\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:11:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Beautiful.\n\n0:11:22\tSPEAKER_00\n Beautiful.\n\n0:11:24\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:11:25\tSPEAKER_00\n So, you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to.\n\n0:11:31\tSPEAKER_00\n Any questions?\n\n0:11:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, just let me know.\n\n0:11:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:11:36\tSPEAKER_00\n Back to our project.\n\n0:11:39\tSPEAKER_00\n The remote control we are going to develop.\n\n0:11:42\tSPEAKER_00\n We will have a selling price of about 25 euros.\n\n0:11:47\tSPEAKER_00\n The profit we are looking for for this product is 50 million euros.\n\n0:11:55\tSPEAKER_00\n Which is quite a number.\n\n0:11:59\tSPEAKER_00\n We will focus internationally.\n\n0:12:01\tSPEAKER_00\n So, the product will be sold if there is market interest in more than one country.\n\n0:12:09\tSPEAKER_00\n And the production costs should not be more than 12 euros 50.\n\n0:12:14\tSPEAKER_00\n So, we should keep that in mind during the development.\n\n0:12:20\tSPEAKER_00\n Because, well, those are important numbers.\n\n0:12:26\tSPEAKER_00\n Then, the discussion.\n\n0:12:28\tSPEAKER_00\n Maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation.\n\n0:12:31\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:12:32\tSPEAKER_02\n I have some technical issues, which I would like to present to you.\n\n0:12:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Before we start the discussion, because there might be some.\n\n0:12:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Influencians.\n\n0:12:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:12:43\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:12:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:12:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:13:08\tSPEAKER_02\n First about my role, role of the industrial designer, I would like to think about the implementation of things and the technical possibilities and impossibilities.\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_02\n So, if someone of you comes up with ideas, I will try to translate them in technical functions.\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_02\n But there might be some impossibilities.\n\n0:13:35\tSPEAKER_02\n So, that's one.\n\n0:13:37\tSPEAKER_02\n And I also will propose some.\n\n0:13:42\tSPEAKER_02\n Some implementations for that.\n\n0:13:44\tSPEAKER_02\n But, well, these are quite the same.\n\n0:13:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Sorry about that.\n\n0:13:49\tSPEAKER_02\n And I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities, which are available, and which might be interesting to implement in our product.\n\n0:13:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:14:00\tSPEAKER_02\n I have some initial ideas about some things, which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming discussion.\n\n0:14:10\tSPEAKER_02\n One thing about interoperability.\n\n0:14:15\tSPEAKER_02\n I think modern remote control shoots control a device, diverse subset of equipment, for instance, DVD player, cell phones, video and audio equipment.\n\n0:14:29\tSPEAKER_02\n So, one remote control for audio equipment.\n\n0:14:34\tSPEAKER_03\n For cell phones?\n\n0:14:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, there should be some interoperability between them.\n\n0:14:41\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it can come in handy.\n\n0:14:43\tSPEAKER_02\n We should discuss that.\n\n0:14:45\tSPEAKER_02\n And we should think about the way how these things should communicate with each other.\n\n0:14:51\tSPEAKER_02\n We're not living in the 1980s anymore, so infrared is not really...\n\n0:14:58\tSPEAKER_02\n not really hard technical stuff anymore.\n\n0:15:01\tSPEAKER_02\n But you should think about things like Bluetooth.\n\n0:15:04\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, but the infrared is, well, a little bit old-fashioned, if you would call it that.\n\n0:15:10\tSPEAKER_03\n But old-to-feeds are equipped with infrared.\n\n0:15:15\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, you can not all.\n\n0:15:17\tSPEAKER_03\n So, that's the most of them.\n\n0:15:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Or you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one.\n\n0:15:23\tSPEAKER_02\n But that's something we should discuss about everybody should think about it.\n\n0:15:29\tSPEAKER_02\n So, that's just my role.\n\n0:15:31\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll just give you everybody some technical input.\n\n0:15:34\tSPEAKER_02\n And I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what the product should be and how it should look.\n\n0:15:40\tSPEAKER_02\n But take these things into account when you start the discussion.\n\n0:15:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, so the main point you are telling us are focused on the interoperability.\n\n0:15:52\tSPEAKER_00\n Yes.\n\n0:15:53\tSPEAKER_02\n And one remote control should control one or more pieces of equipment.\n\n0:15:59\tSPEAKER_02\n And the way of communicating with these equipment.\n\n0:16:02\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:16:03\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, good.\n\n0:16:05\tSPEAKER_00\n That was your presentation.\n\n0:16:07\tSPEAKER_00\n That's it.\n\n0:16:08\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, okay.\n\n0:16:12\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, great.\n\n0:16:16\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll go back to my own presentation.\n\n0:16:25\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:16:28\tSPEAKER_00\n I do think it's time now to discuss some things.\n\n0:16:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implications.\n\n0:16:39\tSPEAKER_00\n There are other things like how to make it trendy, which is I think most routes roll.\n\n0:16:53\tSPEAKER_00\n The way how it should be controlled by the user, which is a rule during this part.\n\n0:17:01\tSPEAKER_00\n So, let's start with you.\n\n0:17:03\tSPEAKER_00\n How do you think the remote should function for the user?\n\n0:17:07\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, I add a few things in mind.\n\n0:17:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, the interoperability, just like Sebastian said, remote should work on different TVs or even different devices.\n\n0:17:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:17:30\tSPEAKER_03\n So, I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just a new store.\n\n0:17:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes.\n\n0:17:38\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it should be for Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product.\n\n0:17:47\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:17:48\tSPEAKER_00\n So, we're going business to consumer.\n\n0:17:50\tSPEAKER_00\n It's not a...\n\n0:17:52\tSPEAKER_03\n I don't know.\n\n0:17:53\tSPEAKER_02\n I have to fail in making this product for a specific vendor.\n\n0:17:56\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:17:57\tSPEAKER_02\n We're just developing this product and we want to set it to a very broad public.\n\n0:18:02\tSPEAKER_02\n So, we should fit to every device.\n\n0:18:04\tSPEAKER_00\n The routes?\n\n0:18:05\tSPEAKER_00\n Do you agree?\n\n0:18:06\tSPEAKER_00\n I think they're right.\n\n0:18:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:18:08\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, the technical function, what you said, is just by pressing the button, you should change the state of the TV.\n\n0:18:19\tSPEAKER_03\n That's just the basic technical function.\n\n0:18:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:18:23\tSPEAKER_03\n That's really my part for this session.\n\n0:18:27\tSPEAKER_00\n So, is that ease of use or is that more like...\n\n0:18:31\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, the technical function is pure.\n\n0:18:35\tSPEAKER_03\n What should the remote control do?\n\n0:18:37\tSPEAKER_03\n What is his task?\n\n0:18:39\tSPEAKER_03\n As an device.\n\n0:18:42\tSPEAKER_03\n It just should change the TVs state.\n\n0:18:46\tSPEAKER_03\n So, that's it.\n\n0:18:48\tSPEAKER_02\n But, as far as the buttons, as a means of doing this, or other...\n\n0:18:53\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, or the buttons.\n\n0:18:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Or maybe you want a touchscreen or...\n\n0:18:58\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I've seen these remote controls with this little stick, which you can move forward, the side-words.\n\n0:19:05\tSPEAKER_02\n And it's very easy for you to switch...\n\n0:19:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:19:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Switch between channels or between tracks on a CD, on chapters, on a DVD player.\n\n0:19:19\tSPEAKER_02\n So, maybe that's an idea, I don't know.\n\n0:19:22\tSPEAKER_03\n For other user interface, I had...\n\n0:19:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, it's more industrial, I think.\n\n0:19:28\tSPEAKER_03\n Pointing at a TV, I think it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to a TV.\n\n0:19:34\tSPEAKER_03\n So, you must point it everywhere.\n\n0:19:37\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:19:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Maybe not even pointed.\n\n0:19:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, just don't even point it.\n\n0:19:42\tSPEAKER_03\n So, in that case, infrared should maybe be restriction to that.\n\n0:19:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:19:48\tSPEAKER_02\n And it's the restriction for the range, the operating range, too.\n\n0:19:52\tSPEAKER_02\n So, when you're not able to point at the device...\n\n0:19:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, if you go to radio...\n\n0:19:58\tSPEAKER_03\n For TV, you're always in the neighborhood of a TV.\n\n0:20:01\tSPEAKER_03\n So, I don't think the range should be a problem to that.\n\n0:20:05\tSPEAKER_03\n If you want to get it working with a radio and you're in outside your garden with just one speaker, then maybe the range should be...\n\n0:20:16\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay, gentlemen.\n\n0:20:18\tSPEAKER_00\n Just to remind you, we have five minutes left for this meeting.\n\n0:20:22\tSPEAKER_03\n Two more things.\n\n0:20:23\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:20:25\tSPEAKER_03\n You're able to feel the buttons without...\n\n0:20:29\tSPEAKER_03\n You have to know what you do without looking at the buttons.\n\n0:20:34\tSPEAKER_03\n So, it should be...\n\n0:20:36\tSPEAKER_03\n As user interface, for feeling, it should be good to understand.\n\n0:20:43\tSPEAKER_03\n So, you can feel the buttons for volume or whatever, I think.\n\n0:20:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:49\tSPEAKER_03\n And, of course, you don't always know where all buttons are.\n\n0:20:52\tSPEAKER_03\n So, it should be visible in dark, too.\n\n0:20:56\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:20:57\tSPEAKER_03\n Those are two really used interface.\n\n0:21:01\tSPEAKER_00\n I'll write down glow in the dark.\n\n0:21:04\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:05\tSPEAKER_00\n That's perfect.\n\n0:21:06\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:21:07\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:21:08\tSPEAKER_00\n I just want to hear Ruts' input for this meeting.\n\n0:21:13\tSPEAKER_00\n Do you have anything already...\n\n0:21:15\tSPEAKER_00\n Idea about how the market will respond to such a product, or what we should take in account when developing such a product?\n\n0:21:23\tSPEAKER_01\n I think most things have already been said, like control multiple devices.\n\n0:21:29\tSPEAKER_01\n And infrared might be an issue.\n\n0:21:34\tSPEAKER_00\n Because?\n\n0:21:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, he said about pointing.\n\n0:21:39\tSPEAKER_01\n But lots of devices already use infrared.\n\n0:21:42\tSPEAKER_01\n So, we probably have to implement that.\n\n0:21:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:21:49\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:21:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Sebastian, did you have any other ideas?\n\n0:22:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, yes, I had.\n\n0:22:03\tSPEAKER_02\n About three months ago.\n\n0:22:05\tSPEAKER_02\n I've seen it, I've forgotten.\n\n0:22:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, yes, I remember.\n\n0:22:10\tSPEAKER_02\n You said something about visibility in dark.\n\n0:22:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Would it be nice for a user to have display on this remote control, on which you can see functions, which makes it easier to operate.\n\n0:22:25\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, maybe I...\n\n0:22:28\tSPEAKER_03\n It can be quite simple.\n\n0:22:30\tSPEAKER_03\n You can just have white buttons with a black mark on it.\n\n0:22:34\tSPEAKER_03\n The digits in black, then it's already visible in dark.\n\n0:22:38\tSPEAKER_03\n So, it don't have to be lightening or fancy.\n\n0:22:42\tSPEAKER_00\n Well, it can be for design.\n\n0:22:44\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah, because we want to develop a trendy product.\n\n0:22:48\tSPEAKER_02\n So, there's a cost limitation too.\n\n0:22:50\tSPEAKER_00\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:51\tSPEAKER_02\n 12 euro 50.\n\n0:22:52\tSPEAKER_02\n That's a big problem, I think.\n\n0:22:55\tSPEAKER_02\n I think the financial part of this project implicates that it's not going to be a high end product.\n\n0:23:02\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:23:03\tSPEAKER_02\n The cost price is very low.\n\n0:23:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Just to mention something.\n\n0:23:07\tSPEAKER_03\n The digits of the painting on the buttons should not fade.\n\n0:23:11\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:23:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, very good.\n\n0:23:13\tSPEAKER_03\n Always have...\n\n0:23:14\tSPEAKER_03\n The soft buttons always clear the paint on it.\n\n0:23:19\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:23:22\tSPEAKER_00\n I have one point which comes in mind now.\n\n0:23:31\tSPEAKER_00\n I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily, or should not consume too much power.\n\n0:23:40\tSPEAKER_00\n Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every other week.\n\n0:23:46\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:23:49\tSPEAKER_00\n So, maybe we could, for example, only light the buttons that are applicable at that moment.\n\n0:23:58\tSPEAKER_00\n Or, yeah, I don't know.\n\n0:24:00\tSPEAKER_00\n That's more...\n\n0:24:01\tSPEAKER_00\n Sebastian's...\n\n0:24:02\tSPEAKER_03\n But then Bluetooth might be a problem.\n\n0:24:05\tSPEAKER_03\n Because I think Bluetooth uses a lot of...\n\n0:24:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, that's it.\n\n0:24:09\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm not sure.\n\n0:24:10\tSPEAKER_02\n I have cell phones have integrated Bluetooth also.\n\n0:24:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, it seems to work quite okay.\n\n0:24:16\tSPEAKER_03\n But you can use Bluetooth all the time, 24 hours a day.\n\n0:24:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Okay.\n\n0:24:21\tSPEAKER_00\n Jenswen, it's over.\n\n0:24:23\tSPEAKER_00\n I'm afraid we do not have any more time.\n\n0:24:28\tSPEAKER_00\n So, we will go back to our own work.\n\n0:24:33\tSPEAKER_00\n Next meeting starts in 30 minutes.\n\n0:24:35\tSPEAKER_00\n And, well, you know your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about it.\n\n0:24:42\tSPEAKER_00\n So, this was...\n\n0:24:45\tSPEAKER_00\n Okay.\n\n0:24:46\tSPEAKER_00\n See you in 30 minutes.\n\n0:24:48\tSPEAKER_03\n Great.\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "Today is the first meeting to generate ideas about developing a new product to
