wet.\n\n0:00:28\tNone\n Okay.\n\n0:00:35\tSPEAKER_00\n Right.\n\n0:00:40\tNone\n Oh, I forgot my pen.\n\n0:00:43\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, I get the needle.\n\n0:00:46\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, no.\n\n0:00:49\tNone\n My screen is small again.\n\n0:00:51\tNone\n I don't know.\n\n0:00:52\tNone\n I love to hear what to do.\n\n0:00:54\tNone\n So, what I can read it like.\n\n0:00:59\tNone\n Hey.\n\n0:01:00\tNone\n My screen is big.\n\n0:01:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Great man.\n\n0:01:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Who starts?\n\n0:01:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I'll start just with another presentation.\n\n0:01:07\tSPEAKER_02\n So, then we can look at the agenda for this meeting.\n\n0:01:14\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:01:16\tSPEAKER_02\n I put some new things in the map.\n\n0:01:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, boy.\n\n0:01:24\tSPEAKER_02\n This is it.\n\n0:01:26\tSPEAKER_02\n I know that shortcut.\n\n0:01:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, our functional design meeting, that's the states we're in.\n\n0:01:34\tSPEAKER_02\n And you're also all three of you have prepared something about it.\n\n0:01:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, we'll just have a look at the notes from the previous meeting.\n\n0:01:46\tSPEAKER_02\n What we thought we had decided, but then we'll look at the three presentations from you.\n\n0:01:58\tSPEAKER_02\n I think you prepared for all of that.\n\n0:02:03\tSPEAKER_02\n We'll look at the new project requirements.\n\n0:02:06\tSPEAKER_02\n You also have received the meal.\n\n0:02:09\tSPEAKER_02\n The new project requirements from our bosses.\n\n0:02:12\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:02:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, I've received a meal with some additional requirements.\n\n0:02:15\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:02:16\tSPEAKER_02\n And I'll have a look of, well, I think we should show them before your presentations, because it's not really a smart to include some things we can't because of the new requirements.\n\n0:02:28\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:02:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions.\n\n0:02:34\tSPEAKER_02\n We have to decide it in this meeting.\n\n0:02:37\tSPEAKER_02\n What our functions will be.\n\n0:02:39\tSPEAKER_02\n And then we can discuss some more closing.\n\n0:02:43\tSPEAKER_01\n We have 40 minutes for this.\n\n0:02:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n0:02:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, the closing, I will not look at that yet.\n\n0:02:55\tSPEAKER_02\n Now, look at the show that this board.\n\n0:03:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, a notes first meeting.\n\n0:03:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Now, I gave a presentation.\n\n0:03:15\tSPEAKER_02\n We've familiarized us with the boards.\n\n0:03:18\tSPEAKER_02\n And then we discussed some first ideas.\n\n0:03:21\tSPEAKER_02\n So we said that we have to merge the strong points from our competitors.\n\n0:03:28\tSPEAKER_02\n And look at their remote controls.\n\n0:03:31\tSPEAKER_02\n We should make it compatible with our new DVD and other releases we have, our technical releases.\n\n0:03:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Not too many buttons.\n\n0:03:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, recognizable button in the middle.\n\n0:03:44\tSPEAKER_02\n Where you do the most important functions with.\n\n0:03:47\tSPEAKER_02\n And well, they can have two functions because you have a DVD and a television.\n\n0:03:52\tSPEAKER_02\n The design has to fit the hands, the original, but also be familiar.\n\n0:03:58\tSPEAKER_02\n It's one of ideas.\n\n0:04:01\tSPEAKER_02\n It's just 30 minutes ago.\n\n0:04:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Now it's right.\n\n0:04:07\tSPEAKER_02\n But I have to do it.\n\n0:04:08\tSPEAKER_02\n The materials should be hard plastic with rubber from the ties.\n\n0:04:11\tSPEAKER_02\n And the labeling of the buttons should be indestructible.\n\n0:04:15\tSPEAKER_02\n It should be easily wiped out.\n\n0:04:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, fronts were the remote just like almost telephones.\n\n0:04:22\tSPEAKER_02\n And the technical aspect.\n\n0:04:24\tSPEAKER_02\n And also labeling of the buttons to functions should be universal standards.\n\n0:04:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, that's just some ideas from the first meeting.\n\n0:04:32\tSPEAKER_02\n And the logical all of it.\n\n0:04:35\tSPEAKER_02\n Now, the new project requirements, I'll just show them.\n\n0:04:38\tSPEAKER_02\n I got this mill from our bosses.\n\n0:04:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, teletext goes out.\n\n0:04:47\tSPEAKER_02\n We will not use teletext.\n\n0:04:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe I need to sort of fit it.\n\n0:04:52\tSPEAKER_02\n But not teletext.\n\n0:04:53\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not my place to disagree, I guess.\n\n0:04:55\tSPEAKER_02\n The second is a bit sh-pitty.\n\n0:04:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Because we just said we wanted to include DVD.\n\n0:05:02\tSPEAKER_02\n And they don't want it.\n\n0:05:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Because of our time, we have for this project.\n\n0:05:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, all right.\n\n0:05:07\tSPEAKER_02\n So that's a shame.\n\n0:05:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Because especially for the third requirement, we want to reach people under the 30 years.\n\n0:05:16\tSPEAKER_02\n Because we don't have those customers at this point.\n\n0:05:20\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, it's a bit pitty.\n\n0:05:21\tSPEAKER_02\n Because those people want to have one remote control for all those technical devices they can-\n\n0:05:29\tSPEAKER_05\n Let's not forget about it. It's just time-consuming.\n\n0:05:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, and our corporate image shoots state-run recognizable in our products.\n\n0:05:37\tSPEAKER_02\n So we have to use maybe a slogan, maybe a color.\n\n0:05:42\tSPEAKER_02\n And, yeah, well, on our remote controls, the design has to be, well, as we're all already said, actually, familiar.\n\n0:05:51\tSPEAKER_02\n Not only does the shape, but also our company.\n\n0:05:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, we are a real fashion-more company.\n\n0:06:02\tSPEAKER_01\n I read it already told that- I didn't know what company we were, but we designed a- Especially trendy stuff.\n\n0:06:09\tSPEAKER_01\n So it has to be a modern design.\n\n0:06:11\tSPEAKER_01\n It's important to know when you design things.\n\n0:06:13\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:06:14\tSPEAKER_02\n I noted our slogan that we have, our company, that's- We put the fashion in electronics.\n\n0:06:22\tSPEAKER_02\n No. So maybe that's a slogan we can put somewhere on our remote control or something.\n\n0:06:28\tSPEAKER_02\n All right, then we're going to have three presentations.\n\n0:06:32\tSPEAKER_02\n You want the start?\n\n0:06:34\tSPEAKER_02\n I think I have to start.\n\n0:06:36\tSPEAKER_02\n I didn't see anything about it.\n\n0:06:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, no, it's the order now.\n\n0:06:40\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, then- I do stuff to think which follows mine, because I was a bit in hurry.\n\n0:06:45\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay, well, where?\n\n0:06:47\tSPEAKER_05\n I think it's this one, but I'm not sure.\n\n0:06:51\tSPEAKER_05\n I'm going to start with these points.\n\n0:06:58\tSPEAKER_02\n I have to- You already opened the PowerPoint.\n\n0:07:05\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes, this is- Yeah.\n\n0:07:07\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, I'm going to tell you something about the functional requirements.\n\n0:07:12\tSPEAKER_05\n To start with these points.\n\n0:07:15\tSPEAKER_05\n Next, you- At first, I tell you something about what people dislike about the current controls, because it's a smart thing to exclude those things.\n\n0:07:27\tSPEAKER_05\n Furthermore, it's very important what they do like and what they do use.\n\n0:07:32\tSPEAKER_05\n Then I tell something about the most important issues.\n\n0:07:36\tSPEAKER_05\n So we have to focus on those three things.\n\n0:07:39\tSPEAKER_05\n And in the end, I'll show you our target audience or our target product users, customers.\n\n0:07:48\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, the first findings are that people think most controls are very kind of ugly.\n\n0:07:58\tSPEAKER_05\n That's 75% of the current users.\n\n0:08:02\tSPEAKER_05\n They don't like it, so we might think about fronts in that section.\n\n0:08:08\tSPEAKER_05\n They also say that's about, I thought it was 50%, that more money will be spent on better looking controls.\n\n0:08:17\tSPEAKER_05\n So it's very important that you design a nice looking control.\n\n0:08:21\tSPEAKER_05\n The current user uses his machine just about, well, all the time for a few functions.\n\n0:08:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Almost every user uses the control for just 10% of his capacity.\n\n0:08:44\tSPEAKER_05\n So it's really important to make the buttons for the common tasks kind of big or kind of flashy.\n\n0:08:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Furthermore, it's 75% of the user's zeppes a lot.\n\n0:09:00\tSPEAKER_05\n It might be smart to make a big zapping button or something in the middle, so you can reach it with your thumb.\n\n0:09:09\tSPEAKER_05\n That's a good way.\n\n0:09:12\tSPEAKER_05\n A lot of users lose their controls in the living room.\n\n0:09:21\tSPEAKER_05\n So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television that your control beeps or something that you can find very easily.\n\n0:09:32\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't know, maybe that's an idea.\n\n0:09:35\tSPEAKER_05\n The big, I think, 50% of the users lose his control.\n\n0:09:40\tSPEAKER_05\n It's in the same room.\n\n0:09:42\tSPEAKER_02\n It's actually loose from the television because it can also be used for other televisions.\n\n0:09:46\tSPEAKER_02\n So if you deliver a small click on device that you can put on your television that beeps to your remote control and you lose your click on the television.\n\n0:09:57\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, but if someone else uses it in another room or something.\n\n0:10:02\tSPEAKER_05\n It's not a room.\n\n0:10:05\tSPEAKER_05\n The control is lost in the same room.\n\n0:10:10\tSPEAKER_05\n So, well, it would be five-seater.\n\n0:10:14\tSPEAKER_05\n Furthermore, the learning time is a problem.\n\n0:10:18\tSPEAKER_05\n 34% thinks it's too difficult to learn.\n\n0:10:25\tSPEAKER_05\n So the learning curve should be very short for the dumb people should be able to use it.\n\n0:10:32\tSPEAKER_01\n I think our user expert should also consider manual for the remote.\n\n0:10:37\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, but people don't read manuals.\n\n0:10:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Now, they don't read it?\n\n0:10:41\tSPEAKER_01\n So it is users to add one.\n\n0:10:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Do you think?\n\n0:10:45\tSPEAKER_05\n I think you should put more time in the design of pick-up and use.\n\n0:10:50\tSPEAKER_04\n It's a manual.\n\n0:10:51\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, right.\n\n0:10:52\tSPEAKER_04\n Because they don't use it.\n\n0:10:53\tSPEAKER_04\n And know how it's supposed to work.\n\n0:10:56\tSPEAKER_02\n You should always be a manual, but can be very careful.\n\n0:10:59\tSPEAKER_04\n Nobody reads all the remote control.\n\n0:11:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:11:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe if you don't recognize a button, who do they call?\n\n0:11:09\tSPEAKER_04\n It should be there, the manual, but not to explain how the remote works.\n\n0:11:14\tSPEAKER_05\n We don't have much time, so it's better to put our attention to the design so you can pick up and use it.\n\n0:11:22\tSPEAKER_02\n We are a design team. We can say to some writer, make a manual.\n\n0:11:26\tSPEAKER_02\n It's part of the...\n\n0:11:28\tSPEAKER_01\n No, no.\n\n0:11:29\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we'll have a look.\n\n0:11:30\tSPEAKER_05\n Next point.\n\n0:11:31\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes?\n\n0:11:32\tSPEAKER_05\n Ericie?\n\n0:11:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, that's about 20% I thought, but the designer should take it to...\n\n0:11:42\tSPEAKER_05\n Consider the consequences of using your remote.\n\n0:11:48\tSPEAKER_05\n It should be a good thing in your hand.\n\n0:11:55\tSPEAKER_05\n Right. This is the most important part.\n\n0:11:58\tSPEAKER_05\n We're...\n\n0:11:59\tSPEAKER_05\n Like the requirements said, we're going to specify...\n\n0:12:02\tSPEAKER_05\n We're going to target a younger audience.\n\n0:12:06\tSPEAKER_05\n That's about 60% of the market, so it's quite important.\n\n0:12:11\tSPEAKER_05\n Research shows that they like to have a little LCD screen on their...\n\n0:12:15\tSPEAKER_05\n...Zapping device.\n\n0:12:18\tSPEAKER_05\n I thought it was the age between 16 and 20, 99% of the people like that.\n\n0:12:26\tSPEAKER_05\n So it's very important. We should definitely have that in our designs.\n\n0:12:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, with 12 Euro 50, as production cost, we can't afford to spend the...\n\n0:12:37\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, but they think it's really important.\n\n0:12:41\tSPEAKER_05\n So if we want to... If we make lots of stuff, maybe we can buy it very cheap.\n\n0:12:50\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't know. We have to...\n\n0:12:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, we'll consider it here.\n\n0:12:55\tSPEAKER_02\n You're tossing to look into the costs of that...\n\n0:12:58\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know if any information on that...\n\n0:13:00\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, we'll look into that later.\n\n0:13:03\tSPEAKER_05\n Right.\n\n0:13:04\tSPEAKER_05\n And another thing is speed recognition.\n\n0:13:07\tSPEAKER_05\n They also like that, but research is very costly.\n\n0:13:10\tSPEAKER_04\n So that's difficult to realize also.\n\n0:13:13\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah. But it might be important for you to...\n\n0:13:17\tSPEAKER_02\n We have very demanding clients.\n\n0:13:19\tSPEAKER_02\n It's not yet a standard development, though, and we have customers...\n\n0:13:22\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, I do think LCD is more...\n\n0:13:24\tSPEAKER_05\n...richable than a standard.\n\n0:13:27\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n0:13:28\tSPEAKER_05\n So we might consider LCD screens.\n\n0:13:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, yeah, all right.\n\n0:13:32\tSPEAKER_01\n We'll consider both and see what we can find, I think.\n\n0:13:35\tSPEAKER_01\n We don't rule them out immediately.\n\n0:13:38\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:13:40\tSPEAKER_05\n I think that's it.\n\n0:13:43\tSPEAKER_05\n I think it is sensible to take these points into the notes...\n\n0:13:51\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:13:52\tSPEAKER_05\n...so you can...\n\n0:13:53\tSPEAKER_05\n Right.\n\n0:13:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I can still see your presentation.\n\n0:13:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, right.\n\n0:13:58\tSPEAKER_02\n...since...\n\n0:13:59\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, next...\n\n0:14:00\tSPEAKER_02\n I don't know who is next.\n\n0:14:02\tSPEAKER_02\n You've got a...\n\n0:14:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Can I give you a technical talk?\n\n0:14:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:14:06\tSPEAKER_02\n I'll give you a little bit of a technical talk.\n\n0:14:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I just might take to explain...\n\n0:14:12\tSPEAKER_01\n...of the point out of working design.\n\n0:14:15\tSPEAKER_01\n Yep.\n\n0:14:16\tSPEAKER_01\n We have that here.\n\n0:14:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay, how do you large it so that you can have the...\n\n0:14:22\tSPEAKER_01\n F5.\n\n0:14:23\tSPEAKER_03\n F5.\n\n0:14:24\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, the working design...\n\n0:14:27\tSPEAKER_01\n That's my...\n\n0:14:29\tSPEAKER_01\n...like button.\n\n0:14:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, all right. You know what I am, and what I do.\n\n0:14:34\tSPEAKER_01\n We have this. It's a bit unclear because I wanted to copy paste something.\n\n0:14:38\tSPEAKER_01\n It was originally in black and white, but it became black and...\n\n0:14:41\tSPEAKER_01\n...per-purple, but...\n\n0:14:43\tSPEAKER_01\n I think you can read it.\n\n0:14:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I think it's important for you to realize the basic function of a remote control.\n\n0:14:51\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, you can see...\n\n0:14:53\tSPEAKER_05\n Maybe you can select it.\n\n0:14:54\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, yes, really?\n\n0:14:55\tSPEAKER_05\n In first.\n\n0:14:56\tSPEAKER_01\n And I don't...\n\n0:14:58\tSPEAKER_01\n I can select on the...\n\n0:14:59\tSPEAKER_01\n The next picture.\n\n0:15:01\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, no, no, no.\n\n0:15:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, you can read it. It's not the difficult.\n\n0:15:06\tSPEAKER_01\n This is a schematic view of how a basic remote control works.\n\n0:15:11\tSPEAKER_01\n You have the energy, the power of the...\n\n0:15:16\tSPEAKER_01\n...mode control and the sender, which is the LED.\n\n0:15:21\tSPEAKER_01\n The bulb that sends the infrared beam to the...\n\n0:15:26\tSPEAKER_01\n...now, to the sender.\n\n0:15:27\tSPEAKER_01\n And the source is, of course, the user.\n\n0:15:31\tSPEAKER_01\n The user interface is...\n\n0:15:33\tSPEAKER_01\n...the buttons, of course.\n\n0:15:35\tSPEAKER_01\n And the user interface sends...\n\n0:15:38\tSPEAKER_01\n...the different signals of the different buttons to the chip.\n\n0:15:42\tSPEAKER_01\n The chip sends it to the LED.\n\n0:15:44\tSPEAKER_01\n And the LED sends it to receive it.\n\n0:15:46\tSPEAKER_01\n That's the basic idea. Very basic.\n\n0:15:50\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I have...\n\n0:15:54\tSPEAKER_01\n...put it in a couple of basic steps.\n\n0:15:59\tSPEAKER_01\n The remote is basically just waiting for a user to press a key.\n\n0:16:02\tSPEAKER_01\n It does nothing until, of course, the key is pressed.\n\n0:16:05\tSPEAKER_01\n The key press is the signal to a chip.\n\n0:16:07\tSPEAKER_01\n The chip sends it to the connection and recognizes the key.\n\n0:16:11\tSPEAKER_01\n So, well, you understand.\n\n0:16:13\tSPEAKER_01\n The chip produces more code, a specific code, to indicate that specific button, that is pressed, of course.\n\n0:16:19\tSPEAKER_01\n And it uses transistors in the remote control...\n\n0:16:22\tSPEAKER_01\n...to amplify and to send that signal, again, to the LED, which is the bulb, of course.\n\n0:16:30\tSPEAKER_01\n And the LED produces an infrared beam, and signals the...\n\n0:16:33\tSPEAKER_01\n...well, it's very simple.\n\n0:16:34\tSPEAKER_01\n And signals to the sensor on the TV set, and the TV set also recognizes the signal...\n\n0:16:42\tSPEAKER_01\n...and performs the assigned task.\n\n0:16:44\tSPEAKER_02\n So, this is also why we have to have a button that says, I'm now busy with a DVD if we had done that.\n\n0:16:50\tSPEAKER_02\n And the button...\n\n0:16:52\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, but we don't have any.\n\n0:16:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n0:16:56\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, this is the basic function of a remote.\n\n0:17:00\tSPEAKER_01\n I have some couple of pictures here.\n\n0:17:02\tSPEAKER_01\n It's a very basic one.\n\n0:17:03\tSPEAKER_01\n And this corp is, if you're going to add an LCD screen to it, it won't look anything like this.\n\n0:17:09\tSPEAKER_01\n But this is very basic, basically, the shape of a remote control...\n\n0:17:14\tSPEAKER_01\n...it has very little buttons.\n\n0:17:16\tSPEAKER_01\n But it's quite...\n\n0:17:20\tSPEAKER_01\n You can easily recognize the buttons.\n\n0:17:22\tSPEAKER_01\n They are far enough apart and anything.\n\n0:17:24\tSPEAKER_01\n It's not very high-tech indeed, and it's not very user-friendly, if you look at the shape.\n\n0:17:32\tSPEAKER_01\n It's just a simple long box shape.\n\n0:17:35\tSPEAKER_01\n So, we have to change a little bit to that.\n\n0:17:38\tSPEAKER_01\n So, that comes more user-friendly, and that problems like air-Z.\n\n0:17:43\tSPEAKER_01\n Don't talk to me.\n\n0:17:46\tSPEAKER_05\n I have a table here about the relevance of the buttons.\n\n0:17:51\tSPEAKER_05\n The power button is used very much.\n\n0:17:53\tSPEAKER_05\n Channel selection, volume, and tail-tech.\n\n0:17:57\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, tail-tech is not an option.\n\n0:17:59\tSPEAKER_05\n But I think it's very important to make the power channel and volume buttons near to the thumb, so you can't have air-Z consequences.\n\n0:18:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, because they are the most important buttons.\n\n0:18:11\tSPEAKER_05\n And you can immediately make them easy to press.\n\n0:18:14\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, you don't have to look and search for them.\n\n0:18:17\tSPEAKER_02\n If you have the most used buttons all in one place, and you keep making the same...\n\n0:18:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, move right.\n\n0:18:24\tSPEAKER_02\n But if you would put it at a different place, then you have to move your hands.\n\n0:18:29\tSPEAKER_02\n And that's one of the things about RZ.\n\n0:18:31\tSPEAKER_05\n That's right.\n\n0:18:32\tSPEAKER_05\n You can't have any...\n\n0:18:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Every button under the thumb, of course.\n\n0:18:36\tSPEAKER_02\n The most important buttons, maybe you can just put them a bit apart, so you would...\n\n0:18:41\tSPEAKER_02\n That's very important.\n\n0:18:42\tSPEAKER_02\n And reject RZ.\n\n0:18:44\tSPEAKER_04\n Maybe you can make for channel changing too little buttons on the side of the remote, so you can just do like this.\n\n0:18:52\tSPEAKER_04\n Yes.\n\n0:18:53\tSPEAKER_02\n I saw that on mobile phones, they also have the other things.\n\n0:18:56\tSPEAKER_05\n They are the most usable.\n\n0:18:57\tSPEAKER_05\n Do people, when they pick up a remote, know that they have to do that?\n\n0:19:03\tSPEAKER_05\n It's a new feature.\n\n0:19:05\tSPEAKER_05\n You can make a double feature like a button on the top and...\n\n0:19:09\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, also, if someone puts a...\n\n0:19:11\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm down there, the remote...\n\n0:19:13\tSPEAKER_04\n It's missing.\n\n0:19:14\tSPEAKER_04\n I think it is sent with.\n\n0:19:16\tSPEAKER_02\n If someone puts up his remote and he touches the side, and he's over there on the next channel, that's very irritating.\n\n0:19:23\tSPEAKER_02\n That's right.\n\n0:19:24\tSPEAKER_02\n I think...\n\n0:19:25\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, but...\n\n0:19:26\tSPEAKER_05\n Right.\n\n0:19:27\tSPEAKER_01\n In any case, the basic function should be indeed, and as you say, at the thumb, I think that's a good idea.\n\n0:19:33\tSPEAKER_01\n And the less important buttons, like the different channels, the numbers, one to three, four, five, and so it should be...\n\n0:19:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, not in reach, because they don't use it all this time.\n\n0:19:44\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, it's pretty, pretty...\n\n0:19:46\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, basically, as you said, and as from pictures of the inside, working, but I don't want to get too technical, because that's not very useful for you or part of the job.\n\n0:19:56\tSPEAKER_01\n So, yeah, you know, this is how it looked from the inside.\n\n0:20:00\tSPEAKER_01\n And, well, that's about it, I think.\n\n0:20:03\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, yeah, I still like this.\n\n0:20:04\tSPEAKER_01\n I had to delete this, but I had to make a schematic of...\n\n0:20:08\tSPEAKER_01\n I had to do a little time, but don't...\n\n0:20:11\tSPEAKER_01\n Don't look at this, please.\n\n0:20:13\tSPEAKER_03\n I think it's clear.\n\n0:20:14\tSPEAKER_02\n We understand how it works.\n\n0:20:15\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:20:16\tSPEAKER_02\n That's the most important thing.\n\n0:20:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Nice.\n\n0:20:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Then, Mike can give the third presentation.\n\n0:20:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Right, latest, did we start this presentation?\n\n0:20:28\tSPEAKER_05\n I think about 20 minutes ago.\n\n0:20:31\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:20:32\tSPEAKER_00\n You do time, you do.\n\n0:20:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Then we have still the time.\n\n0:20:36\tSPEAKER_02\n But we do have to come to a decision.\n\n0:20:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, right.\n\n0:20:39\tSPEAKER_02\n So...\n\n0:20:41\tSPEAKER_02\n So...\n\n0:20:42\tSPEAKER_02\n That's great, ever.\n\n0:20:44\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, I thought everybody on the website would see the same thing, but...\n\n0:20:51\tSPEAKER_04\n Obviously, that's not the case.\n\n0:20:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, there are different...\n\n0:20:56\tSPEAKER_01\n We all have different home pages.\n\n0:20:58\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:20:59\tSPEAKER_04\n Different links, yeah.\n\n0:21:00\tSPEAKER_04\n For instance, you couldn't see this.\n\n0:21:03\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay, yeah, well...\n\n0:21:05\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:07\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, I am my younger, usually in phases, aren't it?\n\n0:21:11\tSPEAKER_04\n The method, well...\n\n0:21:14\tSPEAKER_04\n I use my own experience with remotes to the good look...\n\n0:21:18\tSPEAKER_04\n The remotes on the corporate website, which are these two.\n\n0:21:22\tSPEAKER_04\n These are already used.\n\n0:21:24\tSPEAKER_04\n Yes, these are from another manufacturer.\n\n0:21:28\tSPEAKER_04\n All right.\n\n0:21:29\tSPEAKER_04\n This one is engineering centered, so this one has the most functions on things.\n\n0:21:35\tSPEAKER_04\n This one is user centered.\n\n0:21:37\tSPEAKER_04\n Mm-hmm.\n\n0:21:38\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, I like user centered.\n\n0:21:40\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:21:41\tSPEAKER_04\n I like user centered centered.\n\n0:21:43\tSPEAKER_04\n Also the best.\n\n0:21:45\tSPEAKER_04\n We also.\n\n0:21:46\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, I thought that we used the option to control the DVD also, and tailor text and that kind of stuff.\n\n0:21:56\tSPEAKER_04\n So I thought we would use more or need more buttons than this one.\n\n0:22:02\tSPEAKER_04\n But we have to re-check that because it's required.\n\n0:22:05\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:06\tSPEAKER_04\n That's why this is not relevant anymore.\n\n0:22:10\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:11\tSPEAKER_04\n I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we'll need.\n\n0:22:17\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, right.\n\n0:22:18\tSPEAKER_04\n I kind of like the shape.\n\n0:22:20\tSPEAKER_04\n I think this is what we talked about.\n\n0:22:23\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I think you can't really see it from different sides, but I think...\n\n0:22:28\tSPEAKER_01\n No, I...\n\n0:22:29\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, I see.\n\n0:22:30\tSPEAKER_04\n You can draw it a few...\n\n0:22:32\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:22:33\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:22:34\tSPEAKER_04\n I think we should go further with the idea of removable fronts.\n\n0:22:37\tSPEAKER_04\n Mm-hmm.\n\n0:22:38\tSPEAKER_04\n So you can...\n\n0:22:39\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, customize the...\n\n0:22:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, excuse me, but they all have to have something about the recognition from our company.\n\n0:22:47\tSPEAKER_02\n So we cannot just...\n\n0:22:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, make someone...\n\n0:22:51\tSPEAKER_04\n No, that's not the whole remote that changes.\n\n0:22:53\tSPEAKER_04\n No, but...\n\n0:22:54\tSPEAKER_02\n The side they look at is the front.\n\n0:22:58\tSPEAKER_02\n So if you make a front with just a tie you're on it, then our recognition is totally gone.\n\n0:23:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n0:23:05\tSPEAKER_04\n Now you can put same symbol on every remote.\n\n0:23:09\tSPEAKER_03\n That's the most...\n\n0:23:10\tSPEAKER_03\n Like everything that comes to the back side.\n\n0:23:12\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:13\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, and...\n\n0:23:14\tSPEAKER_04\n Something like this.\n\n0:23:15\tSPEAKER_04\n Yes.\n\n0:23:17\tSPEAKER_04\n It's recognizable.\n\n0:23:18\tSPEAKER_05\n Okay.\n\n0:23:19\tSPEAKER_05\n We can make a symbol of the company right here and a few with the front on it, there's a hole in the front.\n\n0:23:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, so that...\n\n0:23:25\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, don't replace the symbol, yeah.\n\n0:23:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Or the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front.\n\n0:23:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:31\tSPEAKER_02\n But there's no focus on the front.\n\n0:23:32\tSPEAKER_04\n Yes.\n\n0:23:33\tSPEAKER_04\n Okay.\n\n0:23:34\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, so like I said, I thought we'd use more functions.\n\n0:23:39\tSPEAKER_04\n We had to include more functions, but we don't.\n\n0:23:42\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:23:45\tSPEAKER_04\n I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need, maybe some less.\n\n0:23:49\tSPEAKER_04\n Like eject, we don't need some other buttons we don't need.\n\n0:23:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Mike, can you put that picture for me in the work document file?\n\n0:23:57\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, I will.\n\n0:23:58\tSPEAKER_04\n I think for the remote, less is more.\n\n0:24:02\tSPEAKER_04\n Less buttons, the better the design.\n\n0:24:05\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:06\tSPEAKER_04\n We should grow with that concept, I think.\n\n0:24:10\tSPEAKER_05\n Right.\n\n0:24:12\tSPEAKER_05\n I've got another point.\n\n0:24:13\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:24:14\tSPEAKER_05\n There are two target audience, and we've chose for the younger one.\n\n0:24:19\tSPEAKER_05\n Research has shown that it's a high interested in features.\n\n0:24:24\tSPEAKER_05\n They are high interested in features, but they are more critical.\n\n0:24:28\tSPEAKER_05\n For a critical.\n\n0:24:30\tSPEAKER_05\n The younger audience.\n\n0:24:32\tSPEAKER_05\n So we must design a control that really speaks to people.\n\n0:24:39\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, what if we, I at home have a remote that has the most familiar buttons on the top, and the bottom side of the front has a little clap.\n\n0:24:53\tSPEAKER_02\n You can click away, and then you have much more functions that most people don't use, but some do.\n\n0:25:01\tSPEAKER_01\n But I think the most functions underneath that.\n\n0:25:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Clip, aren't as much.\n\n0:25:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, but they usually, their features are important.\n\n0:25:12\tSPEAKER_02\n They want to.\n\n0:25:13\tSPEAKER_04\n But not.\n\n0:25:14\tSPEAKER_04\n But what kind of features?\n\n0:25:15\tSPEAKER_04\n I think these screens are more traditional.\n\n0:25:18\tSPEAKER_04\n But most look at the numbers.\n\n0:25:20\tSPEAKER_05\n The new features are, like I said, LCD and speech control.\n\n0:25:26\tSPEAKER_05\n Our audience, these people, are very like these features.\n\n0:25:33\tSPEAKER_05\n So we must build in something, or they will go to the concurrent.\n\n0:25:39\tSPEAKER_05\n Our competitors.\n\n0:25:41\tSPEAKER_05\n Right.\n\n0:25:42\tSPEAKER_05\n So I do think we have to have some features.\n\n0:25:47\tSPEAKER_05\n Even though they cost a little more.\n\n0:25:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Maybe we could.\n\n0:25:50\tSPEAKER_02\n For some calculators, you have those little LCD, that you can click on or something, or you can click out of the remote.\n\n0:26:00\tSPEAKER_02\n And if that gives you a little bit of set of information.\n\n0:26:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Like a group of.\n\n0:26:04\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:05\tSPEAKER_05\n Which program you are watching or something.\n\n0:26:07\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:08\tSPEAKER_02\n Those kind of things.\n\n0:26:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Because you also have those program recognition for your PCRs.\n\n0:26:14\tSPEAKER_02\n And, yeah, right.\n\n0:26:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, if your remote picks that up also, they can display which program you're currently watching.\n\n0:26:21\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:26:22\tSPEAKER_01\n So it just signals the different.\n\n0:26:25\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, different symbols on the screen, because if you change to channel two, you have two on the screen and two on your.\n\n0:26:33\tSPEAKER_01\n For example, on your LCD screen.\n\n0:26:35\tSPEAKER_02\n It could be such a little that you can click in and out.\n\n0:26:38\tSPEAKER_02\n And you have it.\n\n0:26:40\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, we should keep that simple too.\n\n0:26:42\tSPEAKER_01\n But should it really be clickable?\n\n0:26:45\tSPEAKER_01\n No, maybe.\n\n0:26:46\tSPEAKER_01\n No, it's going to be integrated.\n\n0:26:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Just integrate in design to make it more.\n\n0:26:50\tSPEAKER_05\n More 20.\n\n0:26:51\tSPEAKER_05\n You said like this, you can watch.\n\n0:26:53\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, something like some radios in car.\n\n0:26:56\tSPEAKER_04\n Where it's walking.\n\n0:26:59\tSPEAKER_04\n Are they here?\n\n0:27:00\tSPEAKER_05\n They're coming by there.\n\n0:27:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, that's of course a bit more expensive than the basic calculated design.\n\n0:27:07\tSPEAKER_01\n But the scrolling text and that kind of thing.\n\n0:27:10\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I think it's just scripted.\n\n0:27:14\tSPEAKER_02\n It keeps it rolling.\n\n0:27:16\tSPEAKER_02\n And it's not that it's five minutes of implementing time.\n\n0:27:19\tSPEAKER_02\n Five minutes.\n\n0:27:20\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, yeah, for programming.\n\n0:27:21\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, so I don't think that's the issue.\n\n0:27:23\tSPEAKER_05\n No.\n\n0:27:24\tSPEAKER_05\n All right.\n\n0:27:25\tSPEAKER_05\n All right.\n\n0:27:26\tSPEAKER_02\n We go with the LCD screen.\n\n0:27:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I think so, yes.\n\n0:27:28\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, well, we still need to know how much that will cost.\n\n0:27:31\tSPEAKER_04\n Right?\n\n0:27:32\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't know if I can find that.\n\n0:27:34\tSPEAKER_04\n No, but maybe you'll get that information.\n\n0:27:37\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, right.\n\n0:27:38\tSPEAKER_02\n We can use this board again, I think.\n\n0:27:40\tSPEAKER_02\n We can put some decisions about the controls we want, the issue.\n\n0:27:47\tSPEAKER_02\n Where's my presentation?\n\n0:27:50\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, understand.\n\n0:27:52\tSPEAKER_05\n We should have a general idea of how it's going to look.\n\n0:28:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, we're here now, I think.\n\n0:28:06\tSPEAKER_02\n I've already given you.\n\n0:28:08\tSPEAKER_02\n So we have to decide on the different remote control functions.\n\n0:28:14\tSPEAKER_02\n So we want to have a small LCD screen.\n\n0:28:20\tSPEAKER_01\n Should we start with the most important part?\n\n0:28:23\tSPEAKER_01\n LCD screen at the bottom.\n\n0:28:24\tSPEAKER_01\n All right, but we should start with the power button.\n\n0:28:27\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:28:28\tSPEAKER_05\n How do you set?\n\n0:28:30\tSPEAKER_05\n You just sit in your chair.\n\n0:28:32\tSPEAKER_00\n Huh?\n\n0:28:33\tSPEAKER_04\n We're going to be able to do the LCD screen on top of it.\n\n0:28:35\tSPEAKER_04\n It's a little bit terrible.\n\n0:28:36\tSPEAKER_04\n The natural, because most of the remote has some space left at the bottom.\n\n0:28:41\tSPEAKER_05\n But that's where your handphone might be.\n\n0:28:44\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't know.\n\n0:28:46\tSPEAKER_01\n And then we should centralize the discussion here.\n\n0:28:51\tSPEAKER_01\n I don't know what to do.\n\n0:28:52\tSPEAKER_01\n No, I'm not.\n\n0:28:54\tSPEAKER_05\n We're busy with something.\n\n0:28:56\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, right.\n\n0:28:57\tSPEAKER_05\n Do you think it's better to put the LCD at the bottom?\n\n0:29:00\tSPEAKER_05\n And I think it's better at the top.\n\n0:29:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Why do you think it's better at the bottom?\n\n0:29:04\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, because most remote have some space left at the bottom.\n\n0:29:09\tSPEAKER_04\n And that way you can keep the shape recognizable for it.\n\n0:29:12\tSPEAKER_04\n It's really.\n\n0:29:13\tSPEAKER_01\n But you just can put the whole interface a bit down.\n\n0:29:17\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:29:18\tSPEAKER_05\n And for the integration, that's actually like small.\n\n0:29:22\tSPEAKER_05\n It's wide.\n\n0:29:23\tSPEAKER_05\n It's not high.\n\n0:29:24\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, Mike has a point.\n\n0:29:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Because when I use a remote, I hate the buttons at the bottom.\n\n0:29:34\tSPEAKER_02\n Bottom.\n\n0:29:35\tSPEAKER_02\n So, and I like to use the ones.\n\n0:29:37\tSPEAKER_02\n On the top.\n\n0:29:39\tSPEAKER_02\n So when I have to.\n\n0:29:41\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I agree with you.\n\n0:29:45\tSPEAKER_01\n With few functions, you know, it's also more recognizable.\n\n0:29:49\tSPEAKER_01\n It looks more like a calculator to people if you have the.\n\n0:29:54\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, but we don't want that.\n\n0:29:56\tSPEAKER_02\n You don't want them to look like a calculator.\n\n0:29:59\tSPEAKER_02\n You want to look at.\n\n0:30:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Like hour.\n\n0:30:01\tSPEAKER_02\n Original.\n\n0:30:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, you don't have to throw an important aspect.\n\n0:30:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Like familiarity.\n\n0:30:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Completely away.\n\n0:30:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Because I think it's a.\n\n0:30:10\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it's still important to have it at the top.\n\n0:30:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Because it's more familiar.\n\n0:30:18\tSPEAKER_05\n That's more familiar.\n\n0:30:19\tSPEAKER_01\n That's the problem.\n\n0:30:20\tSPEAKER_05\n When I draw here.\n\n0:30:21\tSPEAKER_05\n It's a bit off.\n\n0:30:23\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, it's a little bit.\n\n0:30:25\tSPEAKER_02\n It needs to be calibration.\n\n0:30:27\tSPEAKER_02\n No, let's talk about that later.\n\n0:30:29\tSPEAKER_02\n You shoot another pen.\n\n0:30:30\tSPEAKER_01\n Maybe that's better.\n\n0:30:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Where?\n\n0:30:33\tSPEAKER_01\n Now, now, now, now, you only have one.\n\n0:30:36\tSPEAKER_05\n Especially that screen.\n\n0:30:37\tSPEAKER_05\n Right, we have to make a decision now.\n\n0:30:39\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:40\tNone\n We don't have much time.\n\n0:30:41\tSPEAKER_05\n No.\n\n0:30:42\tSPEAKER_05\n I think we have a few functions and we can put the LSD above it.\n\n0:30:46\tSPEAKER_05\n I still have lots of room at the bottom.\n\n0:30:49\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, you can put it right.\n\n0:30:50\tSPEAKER_02\n I think it should be at the bottom.\n\n0:30:52\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I'm the.\n\n0:30:53\tSPEAKER_02\n I'm the.\n\n0:30:54\tSPEAKER_04\n The last.\n\n0:30:55\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, yeah.\n\n0:30:56\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:57\tSPEAKER_05\n I thought we were.\n\n0:30:58\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:30:59\tSPEAKER_05\n We're two with VS 2.\n\n0:31:00\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, but what if we.\n\n0:31:01\tSPEAKER_02\n We first decide the different functions.\n\n0:31:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:05\tSPEAKER_03\n And then look at the design.\n\n0:31:06\tSPEAKER_01\n We were busy with that.\n\n0:31:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, we shoot some on the.\n\n0:31:09\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:10\tSPEAKER_01\n The different aspects of the thing.\n\n0:31:12\tSPEAKER_01\n So we have the power button.\n\n0:31:13\tSPEAKER_05\n More of, I think that you two should be.\n\n0:31:15\tSPEAKER_05\n Come to consensus about the LSD.\n\n0:31:17\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:31:18\tSPEAKER_05\n Your.\n\n0:31:19\tSPEAKER_05\n Your job.\n\n0:31:20\tSPEAKER_03\n Yeah, of course, yeah, it's.\n\n0:31:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Well, we have a power button.\n\n0:31:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Guys, you have to agree.\n\n0:31:23\tSPEAKER_01\n I can say, von, it's like this.\n\n0:31:25\tSPEAKER_01\n I agree.\n\n0:31:26\tSPEAKER_01\n We have a power button.\n\n0:31:27\tSPEAKER_02\n Seven buttons.\n\n0:31:28\tSPEAKER_02\n LSD window.\n\n0:31:29\tSPEAKER_02\n The number buttons.\n\n0:31:31\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Channel.\n\n0:31:33\tNone\n Yeah.\n\n0:31:34\tSPEAKER_01\n Volume.\n\n0:31:35\tSPEAKER_01\n Volume control.\n\n0:31:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:31:42\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, let's look at your.\n\n0:31:43\tSPEAKER_02\n The mute button.\n\n0:31:45\tSPEAKER_02\n I love that one.\n\n0:31:47\tSPEAKER_04\n Uh-huh.\n\n0:31:49\tSPEAKER_04\n I think we should use something like this.\n\n0:31:52\tSPEAKER_04\n To.\n\n0:31:55\tSPEAKER_04\n The channel up and channel down button.\n\n0:31:57\tSPEAKER_04\n Yes.\n\n0:31:58\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah, in circle, you know.\n\n0:32:00\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:01\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, that's also designed.\n\n0:32:03\tSPEAKER_04\n Yes.\n\n0:32:04\tSPEAKER_01\n All right.\n\n0:32:07\tSPEAKER_01\n Next.\n\n0:32:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, on this remote, these controls are for something else.\n\n0:32:12\tSPEAKER_04\n Or do you think they were something else?\n\n0:32:14\tSPEAKER_04\n They are for some.\n\n0:32:15\tSPEAKER_04\n Drop some of these buttons.\n\n0:32:16\tSPEAKER_05\n You should.\n\n0:32:17\tSPEAKER_05\n Put that power button channel.\n\n0:32:19\tSPEAKER_05\n And volume should have the most.\n\n0:32:21\tSPEAKER_05\n Importance.\n\n0:32:22\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:32:24\tSPEAKER_04\n I think this should be in one big circle in the middle.\n\n0:32:27\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, but what he said about the RZ was kind of true.\n\n0:32:32\tSPEAKER_05\n When you put them all in the same place, the most used buttons, you're doing the same thing all the time.\n\n0:32:43\tSPEAKER_05\n And that's just what RZ is all about.\n\n0:32:45\tSPEAKER_05\n So it might be smarter to put them a little more parts away from each other.\n\n0:32:52\tSPEAKER_02\n So people have to move their hands.\n\n0:32:54\tSPEAKER_02\n And they get less complaints of RZ.\n\n0:32:58\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one end.\n\n0:33:02\tSPEAKER_01\n That's what I always do because all my important buttons are going to stay in place from time to time.\n\n0:33:06\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:33:07\tSPEAKER_04\n But people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place.\n\n0:33:11\tSPEAKER_01\n No, but they have to be sent.\n\n0:33:12\tSPEAKER_01\n Would we have to choose frequency with button use?\n\n0:33:16\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:33:17\tSPEAKER_05\n The most used channels are most used within the hour.\n\n0:33:24\tSPEAKER_05\n So the channel buttons should be far apart.\n\n0:33:31\tSPEAKER_05\n I think open down.\n\n0:33:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Open down.\n\n0:33:34\tSPEAKER_05\n Far apart from each other.\n\n0:33:36\tSPEAKER_05\n You're thinking about RZ.\n\n0:33:39\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, not too much.\n\n0:33:41\tSPEAKER_04\n But the other two frustrations are far more important.\n\n0:33:48\tSPEAKER_01\n I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together.\n\n0:33:51\tSPEAKER_01\n But you don't have to have volume control.\n\n0:33:54\tSPEAKER_01\n For example, the power button.\n\n0:33:55\tSPEAKER_04\n You can use four times.\n\n0:33:58\tSPEAKER_02\n If someone is constantly zapping, it's not going to miss that the power button is not right beside.\n\n0:34:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Because I have another one.\n\n0:34:06\tSPEAKER_02\n That one can be put away.\n\n0:34:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah.\n\n0:34:12\tSPEAKER_04\n The power button should be left at the top.\n\n0:34:17\tSPEAKER_02\n It should be left.\n\n0:34:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, man, five minutes.\n\n0:34:23\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, five minutes left.\n\n0:34:24\tSPEAKER_05\n Just make some decisions.\n\n0:34:26\tSPEAKER_05\n The most important things we have to...\n\n0:34:28\tSPEAKER_02\n How are we going to do it with those buttons?\n\n0:34:30\tSPEAKER_01\n We can use the drawing board now.\n\n0:34:32\tSPEAKER_01\n I think it doesn't work well.\n\n0:34:34\tSPEAKER_01\n It's pretty nice if we could draw a simple thing.\n\n0:34:39\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, well, it's going to take too much time.\n\n0:34:41\tSPEAKER_05\n You decide that.\n\n0:34:43\tSPEAKER_05\n You decide that.\n\n0:34:44\tSPEAKER_05\n Yes.\n\n0:34:45\tSPEAKER_05\n All right.\n\n0:34:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, the LCD.\n\n0:34:49\tSPEAKER_02\n You are industrial.\n\n0:34:51\tSPEAKER_02\n You are user interface.\n\n0:34:52\tSPEAKER_02\n So I think it's going to go to Mike.\n\n0:34:55\tSPEAKER_02\n But you will have to make consensus with Tyson.\n\n0:34:59\tSPEAKER_04\n Well, consensus.\n\n0:35:02\tSPEAKER_02\n It's a bit hard because we are going to be individually.\n\n0:35:05\tSPEAKER_02\n We are deciding now.\n\n0:35:08\tSPEAKER_05\n Top of the problem.\n\n0:35:10\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I still think it's quite important.\n\n0:35:13\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, it is.\n\n0:35:14\tSPEAKER_01\n At the top, so you say familiarity is important.\n\n0:35:18\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, what if we are going to now decide about the functions and the design comes into the next round?\n\n0:35:25\tSPEAKER_02\n The design round is still to come.\n\n0:35:29\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:35:30\tSPEAKER_02\n So, we agreed we do have LCDs.\n\n0:35:33\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:35:34\tSPEAKER_02\n That's all right.\n\n0:35:35\tSPEAKER_02\n The number thing.\n\n0:35:36\tSPEAKER_02\n That's enough.\n\n0:35:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Are we going to do it like on Mike's screen with one button that says I'm going to do a two-number digital?\n\n0:35:44\tSPEAKER_04\n No.\n\n0:35:45\tSPEAKER_02\n How do you want it to do then?\n\n0:35:47\tSPEAKER_02\n There's one to three or five of you.\n\n0:35:48\tSPEAKER_02\n It has to recognize one as it can still come more.\n\n0:35:53\tSPEAKER_04\n No, if you almost TVs, if you press two numbers, shortly after each other.\n\n0:35:59\tSPEAKER_03\n Yes, it recognizes that.\n\n0:36:00\tSPEAKER_03\n So, no button for that.\n\n0:36:01\tSPEAKER_03\n That's very easy.\n\n0:36:02\tSPEAKER_02\n No.\n\n0:36:03\tSPEAKER_02\n Okay.\n\n0:36:04\tSPEAKER_02\n Anyone, anyone, on other functionalities of our remote?\n\n0:36:10\tSPEAKER_01\n I think these are the most important things.\n\n0:36:12\tSPEAKER_05\n You still have the pictures over there?\n\n0:36:14\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes.\n\n0:36:15\tNone\n So.\n\n0:36:16\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n0:36:25\tSPEAKER_05\n You do need a milk or a different, no.\n\n0:36:29\tSPEAKER_05\n Like this one.\n\n0:36:30\tSPEAKER_05\n You do that.\n\n0:36:31\tSPEAKER_05\n No, we did just chat.\n\n0:36:32\tSPEAKER_02\n We didn't do.\n\n0:36:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Are we?\n\n0:36:34\tSPEAKER_05\n All right.\n\n0:36:35\tSPEAKER_02\n All right.\n\n0:36:36\tSPEAKER_02\n No, okay.\n\n0:36:38\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, because we can integrate with any other remotes, all those buttons on those pictures are irrelevant.\n\n0:36:46\tSPEAKER_02\n Right.\n\n0:36:47\tSPEAKER_02\n So, just for a television, is the door we need?\n\n0:36:50\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah.\n\n0:36:51\tSPEAKER_05\n It's most usable this way.\n\n0:36:54\tSPEAKER_01\n So, it's very, very, very, very function.\n\n0:36:56\tSPEAKER_02\n Data text is gone.\n\n0:36:57\tSPEAKER_02\n So, all those buttons that are to do with data text, oh, screen placing.\n\n0:37:03\tSPEAKER_02\n You have those buttons about, and there's two important ones we're forgetting.\n\n0:37:09\tSPEAKER_02\n There's a screen.\n\n0:37:11\tSPEAKER_02\n You can make it wider and less wide.\n\n0:37:13\tSPEAKER_02\n And the button that you can go to, ah, for your video.\n\n0:37:17\tSPEAKER_05\n Right.\n\n0:37:18\tSPEAKER_05\n I don't think we have to put that underneath the clip.\n\n0:37:21\tSPEAKER_03\n Those two, or just two?\n\n0:37:22\tSPEAKER_01\n Just two under under it.\n\n0:37:24\tSPEAKER_01\n That's a bit waste.\n\n0:37:25\tSPEAKER_04\n We can make a little row of like four buttons down here.\n\n0:37:29\tSPEAKER_04\n Yes.\n\n0:37:30\tSPEAKER_03\n Or, I think, at the top.\n\n0:37:32\tSPEAKER_03\n Your LSDscar is going to go.\n\n0:37:34\tSPEAKER_01\n You can put two or three buttons under another section.\n\n0:37:37\tSPEAKER_01\n That's too complicated.\n\n0:37:38\tSPEAKER_01\n You can just put it somewhere.\n\n0:37:40\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, they aren't used much, not as much as those others.\n\n0:37:43\tSPEAKER_01\n So, you can put it somewhere.\n\n0:37:44\tSPEAKER_01\n They're smaller.\n\n0:37:45\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, it's a bit smaller.\n\n0:37:47\tSPEAKER_01\n And, well, and I think more at the bottom.\n\n0:37:51\tNone\n Yeah, or at the top.\n\n0:37:53\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:37:54\tSPEAKER_01\n What do you think, ah, those buttons?\n\n0:37:57\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, I think that should, in an isolated part, the remote.\n\n0:38:01\tSPEAKER_01\n And where?\n\n0:38:02\tSPEAKER_01\n Or, ah, we designed it later.\n\n0:38:03\tSPEAKER_01\n We have it.\n\n0:38:04\tSPEAKER_01\n And we designed later where everything goes.\n\n0:38:06\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes.\n\n0:38:07\tSPEAKER_02\n Well, and the other, ah, well, if you, why don't those video, if you, go to video, let's always on your remote control.\n\n0:38:15\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, but to have the, ah, the video channel.\n\n0:38:18\tSPEAKER_05\n Oh, you can set to the video channel from zero.\n\n0:38:21\tSPEAKER_04\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:22\tSPEAKER_01\n No, no, not always.\n\n0:38:23\tSPEAKER_01\n Not a zero remote.\n\n0:38:24\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, zero is a different channel than, ah, the video channel.\n\n0:38:27\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, but when you set down zero, you get too happy.\n\n0:38:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, I don't.\n\n0:38:31\tSPEAKER_02\n I go to 99.\n\n0:38:32\tSPEAKER_02\n Then you press 99.\n\n0:38:33\tSPEAKER_04\n I think go to video is.\n\n0:38:36\tSPEAKER_04\n That's the button.\n\n0:38:37\tSPEAKER_01\n But it's easy to go.\n\n0:38:39\tSPEAKER_01\n If you are at a channel 55 and you want to, ah, go immediately to the video channel, you do, you have to push to get to zero.\n\n0:38:48\tSPEAKER_01\n Now, you can be low zero.\n\n0:38:49\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah.\n\n0:38:50\tSPEAKER_03\n More easy to get to, ah, with the specific, ah,\n\n0:38:52\tSPEAKER_02\n the video channel. I use it.\n\n0:38:54\tSPEAKER_05\n Yeah, but if you're choosing to incorporate these buttons, you have to have a channel setting.\n\n0:39:00\tSPEAKER_05\n If you want, if you have a new TV, you have to set the channels.\n\n0:39:03\tSPEAKER_05\n All these different buttons, you have to.\n\n0:39:05\tSPEAKER_02\n Even if I don't have buttons for channels, I think, especially on my remote.\n\n0:39:09\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, well, it's different screen settings.\n\n0:39:11\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, plus and down.\n\n0:39:13\tSPEAKER_04\n You have one button from set frequency or something.\n\n0:39:18\tSPEAKER_04\n And then with plus and minus, you can adjust the, ah,\n\n0:39:22\tSPEAKER_05\n that's the only one we put in there. Shall we show, ah, one for, for a screen, ah, for, ah, channel setting?\n\n0:39:32\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, to, ah, yeah, of course, to configure the program.\n\n0:39:36\tSPEAKER_01\n Oh, no, K button.\n\n0:39:37\tSPEAKER_02\n Oh, you always have in the center, an okay button.\n\n0:39:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Yeah, for your menu.\n\n0:39:43\tSPEAKER_02\n Menu button.\n\n0:39:44\tSPEAKER_01\n You should, yeah, I think that's important.\n\n0:39:47\tSPEAKER_01\n Uh, channel setting menu.\n\n0:39:49\tSPEAKER_01\n And then the settings to change the brightness.\n\n0:39:51\tSPEAKER_01\n The settings to change the brightness and the contrast.\n\n0:39:54\tSPEAKER_01\n Okay.\n\n0:39:55\tSPEAKER_03\n Channel, yeah.\n\n0:39:56\tSPEAKER_02\n So, ah, chief.\n\n0:39:58\tSPEAKER_03\n Chief.\n\n0:40:00\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, say, the menu button is also important.\n\n0:40:04\tSPEAKER_01\n Yes, I have to put it in.\n\n0:40:05\tSPEAKER_01\n Well, I don't see it.\n\n0:40:08\tSPEAKER_01\n Here.\n\n0:40:09\tSPEAKER_04\n Oh, menu, all right.\n\n0:40:11\tSPEAKER_04\n It's like a contrast and brightness should be in the menu.\n\n0:40:15\tSPEAKER_01\n In the menu, yeah.\n\n0:40:16\tSPEAKER_01\n And you can then adjust it with the Japanese buttons or something.\n\n0:40:19\tSPEAKER_01\n Yeah, the settings buttons are juxtaposed.\n\n0:40:22\tSPEAKER_02\n If you are in the menu, guys, we're going to, ah, rooms and, ah, we'll have to decide things on our own, I think.\n\n0:40:29\tSPEAKER_02\n Great.\n\n0:40:30\tSPEAKER_02\n Yes, chief.\n\n0:40:32\tSPEAKER_05\n All right.\n\n0:40:33\tSPEAKER_05\n Well, see you.\n\n0:40:34\tSPEAKER_02\n We have lunchtime, by the way.\n\n0:40:36\tSPEAKER_02\n Now, ah, so, ah, I'm hungry.\n\n0:40:38\tSPEAKER_01\n Lunch.\n\n0:40:39\tSPEAKER_05\n You had to do my belly.\n\n0:40:41\tSPEAKER_02\n Ah, we didn't exactly do everything, man.\n\n0:40:44\tSPEAKER_02\n And we're going to pause and stick, in to it, right?\n\n0:40:47\tSPEAKER_04\n See you later, right?\n\n0:40:48\tSPEAKER_02\n So, I must have done something close and close.\n\n0:40:53\tSPEAKER_02\n I've done the closing, eh?\n\n0:40:54\tSPEAKER_02\n I must have done something close and close.\n\n0:40:56\tNone\n I've done something close.\n\n0:40:57\tSPEAKER_02\n I've done something close and close and close.\n\n0:40:58\tSPEAKER_02\n followed by this modern\n\n0:41:04\tNone\n car version in\n\n", "summary": [{"summary_text": "None's screen is too small.
