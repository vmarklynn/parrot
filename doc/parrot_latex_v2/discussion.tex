We introduced a pipeline that transcribes, diarizes, and summarizes conversation meetings using Whisper, Pyannote, and a retrained BART model, resulting in a 148% improvement in summarization. Our solution is integrated into a user-friendly website built with Django, allowing users to upload meeting recordings and obtain comprehensive transcripts and summaries. Our work paves the way for more effective meeting analysis and information accessibility in various contexts and industries.

However, our project currently faces limitations in terms of the quality of the human reference and the availability of data. Expanding the scope and performance of our summarizer to cover different meeting domains requires access to more diverse and comprehensive data sets. This would enable the model to learn and adapt to various meeting scenarios, ultimately improving its accuracy and generalizability.

Future work should focus on making our application more marketable to companies by improving the summarization capabilities and providing accurate and insightful analysis of workplace meetings.
Additional application features could include visualizations of meeting using colors and waveforms, speaker recognition that allows the model to learn overtime to recognize previously encountered voices, and sentiment analysis.
