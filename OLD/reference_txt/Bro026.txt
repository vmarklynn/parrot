The meeting occurred close to the finalization of the model for Aurora. The team had put together a model and was tweaking it to see what achieves best performance. The professor suggested that it was time to make some decisions, have several constants, and then test other theories on remaining features. The neural net, for instance, was yet to come together. Still, the model was second in ranking for the task, behind the leader by only one point. The evaluation criteria for the tasks was still not completely clear, but the team seemed to be doing well.
