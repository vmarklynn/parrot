The meeting took place close to the finalization of the model, so participants were focused on further experimentation they could conduct. It began with a discussion about how the backend system could be further improved. The team thought that perhaps they could tweak language scaling and insertion penalties to see how the model changed its performance. Then, the team moved into discussing methods for detecting voice segments in their results. Finally, the team spent some time exploring normalization techniques and acoustic events, both of which could potentially improve model performance.
