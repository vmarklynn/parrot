This meeting was about technical design. Firstly, the group had three presentations on remote components, user interface and market trends. They presented remote control features including the circuit board, the chip, the kinetic energy, the interface mechanism of operation, the scroll wheel to be added as well as the LCD and spinning innovation. Then, the group had a discussion about the key remote concepts. They decided to have a LCD display with a spinning wheel. They would not have hand dynamos, instead, they would have a wind dynamo. And they would keep the kinetic energy as an option and look at more spongy material preferences with rubber or plastic.
