An idea for future work was suggested during the visit of the german project manager: the possibility to use the same system for language generation. Setting up certain inputs in the Bayes-net would imply certain intentions, which would trigger dialogues. There is potential to make a conference paper out of presenting the current work and the project aspirations within a parsing paradigm. The focus should be the Bayes-net, to which all other modules interface. Situation, User, Discourse and Ontology feed into the net to infer user intentions. It was suggested that they start analysing what the Discourse and Ontology would give as inputs to the Bayes-net.
