The meeting began with the harsh budget problem that the group had to cut down something of the current conceptual remote control, otherwise they would be unable to handle the cost. They talked about reducing the buttons, integrating functions, or using cheaper materials. After the discussion, the Marketing offered a questionnaire for the group to check if they were on the right track. Through the questionnaire, they found that it would be better if they paid more attention to the external design so the Industrial Design embellished the current design on the color and logo. As the last thing left to the meeting, the group reviewed their cooperation and got a general plan of their coming group presentation.
