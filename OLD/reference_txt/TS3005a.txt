A new remote control project was introduced by Project Manager. Members made self-introductions and began to know each other by guessing animals others drew. Project manager said that the remote control would be sold at 25 Euros and a production cost of 12.5 Euros. Project Manager also hoped to achieve fifty million Euros and international market by new remote control. Then the team discussed the disadvantages of the remote control and designed a new remote control style. Industrial Designer made a desire to design a remote control that can be used in different devices with most used buttons. Project Manager agreed that rather than complicated buttons, friendly to users and minimalist design with necessary buttons would be better.
