The group discussed the current state of their work, which was coming close to a conclusion. They were putting together their final model, including the various techniques they had explored. Their performance on the Aurora tasks was second and very close to those in first place. The professor thought that further tweaking and incorporation of a neural network would improve their scores. The team discussed which method to use for noise suppression, which had not been decided yet. They also delved into a more detailed discussion of the VAD and latency. Their method for noise estimation would add a notable delay to the model. Finally, the team delved further into how to finish up the model.
