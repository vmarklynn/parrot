The meeting was mainly about the conceptual design of the remote control. Firstly, marketing introduced market research and fashion trends around the world. While the user interface emphasized that easy to use was more important. Then the industrial designer talked about the overall requirements from the engineering point of view, including the size of the device and source of energy. The group members spent time figuring out the real size of the TFT screen and energy problem. After that, they discussed the shape of the remote control and decided to make it like a banana. Based on this shape, they talked about the detailed design of the appearance and user interface.
