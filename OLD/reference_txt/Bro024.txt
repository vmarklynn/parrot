The team discussed SRI experiments, multi-band approaches, latency, VAD, and noise addition. The mean subtraction approach for SRI that relied on a twelve second interval resulted in a zero point three percent improvement over the six second model, not necessarily significant. The team thought that training the model on different speeds of speech would be helpful to add to this progress. Grad A introduced the team to her formal proposal for the qualifier exam. The work focused on intermediate classifiers and multi-band graphical models for speech recognition. The team then discussed noise removal as well The model PhD B was working on did not do well in non-stationary noise environments. In general, however, the model had improved. The VAD was labeling speech as silence segments, which could be attributed to alignment issues. The team thought that noise addition techniques might help the model.
