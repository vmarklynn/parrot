This is the second meeting of the design group. Project Manager went through the notes of the last meeting and informed the team of the management's requirements. They expected the remote control to cover television only and asked the team to incorporate the company logo and colours. As the team is looking at extreme simplicity, the buttons should be reduced to the absolute minimum. Voice recognition can also be added to reach this point. In addition, the remote control can be powered by a rechargeable or permanent battery.
