Project Manager gave the team members a brief introduction of the new remote control project, then the team started an ice breaking game by drawing their favourite animals. The expected selling price of the remote control is 25 Euros and the production costs would be limited to twelve and a half Euro per unit. Marketing plan would depend on overhead costs. The team agreed that the remote needs to be robust, and they wanted it to be a device for all with accessible buttons. Project Manager suggested it to be only a television remote control instead of a multi-functional one.
