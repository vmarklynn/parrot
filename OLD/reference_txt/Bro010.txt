The meeting was about various approaches that the team could pursue for further research. The team initially discussed the delay between the frequency bands which was causing problems in the model deployment. They then discussed how spectral subtraction could help various tasks. The meeting ended with more ideas on improving the model, like directionality of voice and looking at smaller units of sound in recordings.
