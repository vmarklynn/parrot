The meeting was about a preliminary idea of new remote control, covering the price, the functions, the appearance and the name. After a brief self-introduction, Project Manager assigned the task. One of the most important issues of the meeting was about the price. Project Manager supposed the product should be sold at 25 euros with a one hundred percent profit. As it would be a multifunctional remote control, the members were confident that it would stand alone. Moving on to the issue of the appearance, the group analyzed the problems of the existing remotes and briefly talked about the user interface as well as came up with a name of the product.
