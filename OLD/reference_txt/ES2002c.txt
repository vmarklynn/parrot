This meeting was about the conceptual design of the remote control. Firstly, Marketing presented on the market trend and suggested a remote control with a fancy look and feel, technology innovation, and spongy material. Next, User Interface presented on conceptual design and recommended the control itself should use an inconsistent colour scheme. Then, Industrial Designer presented on the component design and that the cost, the complexity, and the size would have an impact on their remote design and reminded there would be a restriction on grouping plastic and rubber cases together. Lastly, the group discussed remote concepts and decided to have a small size remote with the speaker, the chip on print for the power, and a rubber case.
