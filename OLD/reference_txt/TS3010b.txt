The team introduced their findings in turns and gradually came to some agreements. First, Industrial Designer introduced the structure of the device and suggested one battery and small size. Meanwhile, Project Manager questioned the cover design since it would not be cheap. Then, User Interface left a question whether the technical function should be basic or multi-functional. After that, Marketing concluded that less important functions should be discarded and the device should be user friendly. Lastly, Project Manager suggested discarding the teletext and asked for ideas about button design.
