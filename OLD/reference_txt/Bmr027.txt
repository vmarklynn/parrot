The meeting was mostly about the logistics of covering the legal bases around releasing meeting data. The team wanted to make sure that meeting participants would not sue for libel or releasing unwanted information. The team also went over the transcriptions that IBM had done as well as storage space, which was finally looking up. The meeting ended with a general discussion about the progress of the group and future directions.
