The meeting included an introduction to the project, the mechanics of training the data, standardizing the data for the models, the time involved, and planning efficient use of computational resources . The team members shared and discussed the existing model as well as the tests they intended to run. There was a problem standardizing labels as well as converting HTK labels to the format that the team wanted. Adding more dimensions to the current model was also causing concern because of the upper bound on computational resources.
