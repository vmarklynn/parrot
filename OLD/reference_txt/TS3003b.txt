The whole meeting was focused on the functional design of the new remote control project. First of all, Marketing, User Interface, and Industrial Designer each gave a presentation about user requirements, technical function design, and working design respectively. Then, Project Manager announced some amendments to project requirements, which automatically rejected some of the previous assumptions and aroused further discussion about design and functionality with people above 40 as target customers.
