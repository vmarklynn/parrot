The group met to decide which features were desired by users and to decide how to design the shape and appearance of the remote control. Marketing and User Interface presented on what features were desired by remote control users, and Industrial Designer presented on the required internal components of a remote control. They decided not to pursue speech recognition and settled on designing a rounded one-handed remote control with minimal buttons.
