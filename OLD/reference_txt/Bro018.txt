The meeting began with an update on the voice-unvoice detection. The professor suggested the solution might just be feeding the log magnitude of the spectrum into a simple neural net. The team then had a brief discussion about some confusing formula on the France Telecom proposal. Following this, the team talked about how to pick out the most important acoustic events. Then, Grad A introduced the team to phonological matchings that he was working on using Support Vector Machines. The goal was to map MFCC's to phonological features. The team concluded by discussing a potential bug which led to a significant difference between PLP and mel cepstrum and the FFT method that they were exploring.
