The participants discussed how meetings would be transcribed, what kind of information to include in their corpus as well as how to structure it, issues with storing data, and their model. They were particularly concerned with how IBM could assist with transcribing meetings and how they would manage large amounts of data if they include more information in their corpus, given that they were running low on storage. They decided that they could store the data on tapes for backup, and that they would wait and see how IBM transcribes their meetings. As for the modeling, PhD I reported several results and a few members of the team decided to further discuss progress in a smaller meeting later on.
