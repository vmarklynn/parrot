Project Manager introduced a new remote control project. The team started to know each other by introducing their roles in this project. Project Manager then invited everyone to raise ideas about the remote. Their discussion included its versatility, anti-loss design and possible appearance, but there was no final decision on these matters. The team agreed that the remote control should be one-handed, user-friendly and globally attractive. In addition, they noticed that these ideas should be realized under the price target and balance the stability and design sense of the remote control.
