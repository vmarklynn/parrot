The meeting was about a second-stage idea of the new television remote. The meeting began with individual presentations in which the members shared their personal views towards the design, the target consumers and the functions and so on. Later they also paid attention to the marketing method like how to limit the cost within 12.5 euros and include the multi functions in only one microchip. What is also important, they allocated some time to the issue of putting fashion into the design, for example, using plastic material and carefully choosing the company colour and the slogan on the screen.
