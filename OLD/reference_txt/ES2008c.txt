This meeting was about the conceptual design of the remote control. Firstly, groupmates presented on the conceptual specification on components, properties and materials as well as a conceptual specification on user interface design. Also, they suggested conceptual designs including the buttons, the circuit board, the chip to print as well as the LCD screen with backlighting in the device. Then, the group had a discussion on the final remote control concepts. So, they decided to have changeable covers in fruity colours, rechargeable batteries and scroll wheels. And they would leave the spongy case and the standard of the chip to be discussed in the next meeting.
