0:00:00	SPEAKER_06
 Okay, Adam, what is the mic that Jeremy's wearing?

0:00:04	SPEAKER_06
 It's the earplug mic.

0:00:06	SPEAKER_02
 It's the earplug.

0:00:08	SPEAKER_06
 Is that a wireless or no?

0:00:10	SPEAKER_06
 No, it's wired.

0:00:12	SPEAKER_02
 Is that old school?

0:00:14	SPEAKER_02
 You can't hear anything during the meeting.

0:00:16	SPEAKER_07
 What?

0:00:17	SPEAKER_07
 What?

0:00:18	SPEAKER_07
 Should we close the door?

0:00:20	SPEAKER_05
 It's a fairly good mic actually.

0:00:24	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I shouldn't say it's a good mic.

0:00:28	SPEAKER_05
 All I really know is that the signal level is okay.

0:00:30	SPEAKER_05
 It's a quality.

0:00:32	SPEAKER_07
 That's a...

0:00:34	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, necessary.

0:00:36	SPEAKER_05
 So, I can send out agenda items because until five minutes ago we only had one agenda item and now we have two.

0:00:42	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:00:44	SPEAKER_07
 So, just to repeat the thing that we said last week, there was this suggestion of alternating weeks on more automatic speed recognition related or not.

0:00:55	SPEAKER_07
 Right.

0:00:56	SPEAKER_07
 So, what sort of division?

0:00:58	SPEAKER_05
 So, which week are we in?

0:01:00	SPEAKER_05
 Well, we haven't really started, but I thought we were more or less did meeting recorder stuff last week, so I thought we could do...

0:01:08	SPEAKER_07
 I thought we had a thing about speed recognition last week too.

0:01:12	SPEAKER_05
 But I think you're also, if they're short agenda items, we could also do a little bit of each.

0:01:16	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:01:18	SPEAKER_05
 It seemed to be having difficulty getting this adjusted.

0:01:20	SPEAKER_05
 Here we go.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_05
 So, as most of you should know, I did send out the consent form thingies.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_05
 And so far no one has made any comments on them.

0:01:32	SPEAKER_05
 So, no one has bleeped out anything.

0:01:34	SPEAKER_05
 So, yeah.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_05
 I don't expect anyone to, but...

0:01:38	SPEAKER_07
 So, what follows at some point you go around and get people to sign something?

0:01:44	SPEAKER_05
 No. We had spoken about this before and we had decided that they only needed to sign once.

0:01:50	SPEAKER_05
 And the agreement that they already signed simply said that we would give them an opportunity.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_05
 So, as long as we do that, we're covered.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_07
 And how long of an opportunity did you tell them?

0:01:58	SPEAKER_05
 July 15th.

0:02:00	SPEAKER_07
 July 15th.

0:02:02	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, so they have a plenty of time.

0:02:04	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah. Given that it's that long, why was that day chosen?

0:02:08	SPEAKER_07
 You just felt like...

0:02:09	SPEAKER_05
 Jane told me July 15th.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_05
 So, that's what I said.

0:02:12	SPEAKER_02
 I just meant that that was the release date that you had on the data.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, I didn't understand that there was something specific.

0:02:20	SPEAKER_05
 I had heard July 15th, so that's what I put.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_07
 The only mention I recall about that was just that July 15th or so is when this meeting starts.

0:02:30	SPEAKER_07
 That's why.

0:02:32	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, I see.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_02
 You said you wanted it to be available then.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_02
 You mean it to be the hard deadline.

0:02:38	SPEAKER_02
 It's fine with me if it is or a week.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_02
 But I thought it might be good to remind people two weeks prior to that.

0:02:44	SPEAKER_02
 So, by the way, what's your last?

0:02:46	SPEAKER_07
 We probably should have talked about it.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_07
 Because if we want to be able to give it to people July 15th, if somebody is going to come back and say, okay, I don't want this and this and this and this used.

0:02:57	SPEAKER_07
 Clearly, we need some time to respond to that.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, as I said, I just got one date and that's the one I used.

0:03:03	SPEAKER_05
 So, but I can send a follow-up.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, it's almost all us.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, the people who are in this meeting was...

0:03:11	SPEAKER_05
 These meetings that were in set one.

0:03:14	SPEAKER_06
 Was my response okay?

0:03:15	SPEAKER_06
 I just replied to the email saying they were all fine.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_05
 That's fine.

0:03:18	SPEAKER_05
 My understanding of what we had agreed upon when we had spoken about this months ago was that we don't actually need a reply.

0:03:28	SPEAKER_05
 We just need to tell them that they can do it if they want.

0:03:30	SPEAKER_05
 I just didn't remember.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_05
 And so, no reply is no changes.

0:03:34	SPEAKER_02
 And he's got it.

0:03:35	SPEAKER_02
 So, the default thing you see when you look at the page is okay.

0:03:38	SPEAKER_02
 So, that's very clear all the way down the page.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_02
 And they have two options.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_02
 They can change it to one of them is sensor.

0:03:44	SPEAKER_02
 And the other one is incorrect.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_02
 Which means also we get feedback on if there's something that needs to be adjusted.

0:03:54	SPEAKER_02
 Because these are very highly technical things.

0:03:57	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, it's an added level of checking on the accuracy of the transcription as I see it.

0:04:01	SPEAKER_02
 But in any case, people can agree to things that are wrong.

0:04:04	SPEAKER_05
 So, the reason I did that was just so that people would not ask to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_02
 And the reason I liked it was because it gives them the option of being able to correct it.

0:04:19	SPEAKER_02
 Very.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_02
 Approved and corrected.

0:04:22	SPEAKER_02
 And so, you have it nicely set up so they email you and...

0:04:29	SPEAKER_05
 When they submit the form, it gets processed and emailed to me.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_02
 And I wanted to say the meetings that are involved in that set are robustness and meeting recorder.

0:04:37	SPEAKER_02
 The German ones will be ready for next week.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_02
 Those are three of those different set of people.

0:04:42	SPEAKER_02
 And we can move on.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_02
 German ones?

0:04:44	SPEAKER_02
 Well.

0:04:45	SPEAKER_07
 NSA.

0:04:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, I spoke loosely.

0:04:48	SPEAKER_02
 The German French... sorry, the German Dutch and Spanish ones.

0:04:52	SPEAKER_06
 All those are the NSA's.

0:05:04	SPEAKER_02
 The German Dutch and Spanish.

0:05:31	SPEAKER_05
 That's a month, which is...

0:05:34	SPEAKER_05
 The only thing I said in the email is that the data is going to be released on the 15th.

0:05:36	SPEAKER_05
 I didn't give any other deadline.

0:05:38	SPEAKER_05
 So, my feeling is if someone after the 15th says, wow, I suddenly found something, we'll delete it from our record.

0:05:44	SPEAKER_05
 We just won't delete it from whatever has already been released.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_02
 That's a little bit difficult.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_05
 What else can we do?

0:05:53	SPEAKER_05
 If someone says, hey, look, I found something in this meeting and it's libelous and I want it removed.

0:05:59	SPEAKER_05
 What can we do?

0:06:01	SPEAKER_02
 We have to remove it.

0:06:02	SPEAKER_02
 It's true.

0:06:03	SPEAKER_02
 I agree with that part.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_02
 But I think that we need to have a message to them very clearly that beyond this date, you can't make additional changes.

0:06:14	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, I think that somebody might request something even though we say that, but I think it's good to at least start someplace like that.

0:06:25	SPEAKER_07
 So, if we agreed, okay, how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have if we say two weeks or if we say a month?

0:06:32	SPEAKER_07
 I think we should just say that, say that, you know, as...

0:06:36	SPEAKER_07
 or the page you signed, you have the ability to look over this stuff, so forth.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_07
 And because we...

0:06:46	SPEAKER_07
 I would imagine it's a certain generic thing, I would say, because we will continually be making these things available through other researchers.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_07
 This can't be open-ended, and so please give us back your response within this, you know, within this amount of time.

0:07:02	SPEAKER_05
 Well, did you rep-email and look at the pages, I sent?

0:07:05	SPEAKER_05
 Did I know?

0:07:06	SPEAKER_05
 I haven't.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, well, why don't you do that and then make comments on what you want me to change?

0:07:10	SPEAKER_07
 No, no, I'm not saying that you should change anything.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_07
 But I'm trying to spark a discussion, hopefully, with people who have ever had it, so that you can decide on something.

0:07:20	SPEAKER_07
 So, I'm not telling you what to decide.

0:07:22	SPEAKER_07
 I'm just saying you should decide something.

0:07:24	SPEAKER_05
 I already did decide something, and that's what's in the email.

0:07:26	SPEAKER_05
 And if you disagree with it, why don't you read it and give me comments on it?

0:07:29	SPEAKER_02
 I think that there's one missing line.

0:07:31	SPEAKER_07
 Well, the one thing that I did read that you just repeated to me was that you gave the specific date of July 15th.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_07
 And you also just said that the reason you said that was because someone said it to you.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_07
 Right. So, what I'm telling you is that what you should do is come up with a length of time that you guys think is enough, and you should use that rather than the state that you just got from somewhere.

0:07:52	SPEAKER_07
 That's all I'm saying.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_02
 I have one question.

0:07:55	SPEAKER_02
 This isn't the summer period, and presumably people may be out of town, but we can make the assumption can't we that they will be receiving email most of the month, right?

0:08:07	SPEAKER_07
 Well, you're right. Sometimes somebody will be away, and for any length of time that you choose, there is some person, sometimes who will not end up reading it.

0:08:20	SPEAKER_07
 It's just a certain risk to take.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_01
 So maybe when am I on by the way?

0:08:27	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:08:28	SPEAKER_01
 You should be.

0:08:29	SPEAKER_05
 Hello.

0:08:30	SPEAKER_05
 You should be Channel B.

0:08:32	SPEAKER_01
 Okay. All right. So maybe we should say in when the whole thing starts, when they sign the agreement that specified exactly how they will be contacted, and they can be asked to give a phone number and an email address or both.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_01
 And then say very clearly that if they don't hear from them, as more suggested by a certain time or after a certain period, after we contact them, that is a bliss of the giving their agreement.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_05
 Well, they've already signed a form.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_05
 And the form was approved by human subjects, so if that's going to be a little hard to modify.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_02
 Well, the form doesn't say if you don't respond by X number of days or X number of weeks.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_01
 So what does it say about the process of the review process?

0:09:32	SPEAKER_02
 That you'll be provided access to the transcripts and then allowed to remove things that you'd like to remove before it goes to the general larger audience.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, you can read what you already signed.

0:09:44	SPEAKER_03
 I guess when I read it, I'm not as diligent as Chuck, but I had the feeling I should probably respond until Adam, like, I got this and I will do it by this date.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_03
 And if you don't hear from me by then, in other words, responding to your email once, right away, saying, as soon as you get this, could you please respond.

0:10:02	SPEAKER_03
 And then if the person thinks they'll need more time because they're out of town or whatever, they can tell you at that point because...

0:10:10	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, I just didn't want to do that because I don't want to have a discussion with every person if I can avoid it.

0:10:16	SPEAKER_05
 So what I wanted to do was just send it out and say on the 15th of the date is released if you want to do something about it, do something about it, but that's it.

0:10:24	SPEAKER_03
 I kind of like this.

0:10:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, so we're assuming that...

0:10:28	SPEAKER_01
 That would be great, but you should probably have a legal person look at this and make sure it's okay.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_01
 Because if you do this and then there's this put later and someone who understands these matters concludes that they didn't have enough opportunity to actually exercise their right.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_03
 Or they might never have gotten the email because although they sign this, they don't know by which date to expect your email.

0:10:58	SPEAKER_03
 So someone who's machine is down or whatever, I mean we have no internally that people...

0:11:04	SPEAKER_05
 Well, okay, let me reverse this.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_05
 So let's say someone I send this out and someone doesn't respond.

0:11:10	SPEAKER_05
 Do we delete every meeting that they were in?

0:11:14	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think so.

0:11:16	SPEAKER_05
 We're hoping that doesn't happen, but that's why there's such a dangerous, dirt mail.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_05
 That will absolutely happen because people don't read their email or they'll read and say I don't care about that, I'm not going to delete anything and they just won't reply to it.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_01
 So we have mailing addresses for these people?

0:11:29	SPEAKER_05
 No. We have what they put on the speaker form which was just generic contact information.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_02
 But the ones that we're dealing with now are all local except the ones who...

0:11:37	SPEAKER_02
 We're totally in contact with all the ones in those two years.

0:11:40	SPEAKER_02
 So maybe...

0:11:42	SPEAKER_02
 That's not that many people and if there is an advantage to having them admit and if I can help with processing that, I will.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_02
 There is an advantage having them be on record as having received the mail and indicated.

0:11:54	SPEAKER_05
 I thought we had discussed this like a year ago.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_05
 And so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up yet again.

0:12:01	SPEAKER_07
 Well, we haven't experienced it before.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_03
 You'll either wonder at the beginning or you'll wonder at the end.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_03
 I mean there's no way to get around.

0:12:11	SPEAKER_03
 It's pretty much the same amount of work except for an additional email just saying they got the email.

0:12:16	SPEAKER_03
 And maybe it's better legally to wonder before a little bit earlier than.

0:12:21	SPEAKER_02
 It's much easier to explain.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_05
 Morgan can talk to our lawyer about it and find out what the status is on this because I don't want to do something that we don't need to.

0:12:30	SPEAKER_05
 Because what I'm telling you, people won't respond to the email.

0:12:34	SPEAKER_05
 No matter what you do, they're going to be people who you're going to have to make a lot of effort to get in contact with.

0:12:40	SPEAKER_05
 And do we want to spend that?

0:12:42	SPEAKER_04
 It's kind of like signing up for a mailing list. They have opt-in and opt out.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_04
 And there are two different ways.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_04
 I mean in either way works probably.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_02
 Except I really think in this case, I agree with Liz that we need to be in the clear and not have to after the fact say, oh but I assumed.

0:12:56	SPEAKER_02
 And oh I'm sorry that your email address was just accumulating mail without notifying you.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_07
 If this is a purely administrative task, we can actually have administration do it.

0:13:05	SPEAKER_07
 But the thing is that I think without going through a whole expensive thing with our lawyers from my previous conversations within my sense very much is that we would want something on record.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_07
 Yes.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_07
 Is indicating that they actually were aware of this.

0:13:22	SPEAKER_05
 Well we had talked about this before and I thought that we had even gone by the lawyers asking about that and they said, you have to, they've already signed away with that form.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_05
 They've already signed once.

0:13:33	SPEAKER_02
 I don't remember that this issue of the time period allowed for response was ever covered.

0:13:39	SPEAKER_07
 Okay. We never really talked about that.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_03
 Or the data which they would be receiving the email.

0:13:43	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:13:44	SPEAKER_03
 Or how they would indicate.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_07
 We certainly didn't talk a bit with them at all about the manner of them being.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_07
 We do it like with the materials available.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_07
 That was something that was sort of just within our implementation.

0:13:55	SPEAKER_01
 We can use a, we can use a, like they use to, you know, when they serve like, you know, like deadbeat, bats, they make it look like they want something in the lottery and then they open that love with that.

0:14:11	SPEAKER_01
 Right. And then the thing is served. So you just make it, you know, you want, you know, go to this website and you've.

0:14:19	SPEAKER_03
 That's why you never open these things.

0:14:21	SPEAKER_05
 Well, it's just we've gone from one extreme to the other where at one point a few months ago, Morgan was you were saying, let's not do anything.

0:14:29	SPEAKER_05
 And now we're, we're saying we have to follow up each person and get a signature. I mean, what are we doing here?

0:14:35	SPEAKER_01
 And then this is perfectly, you know, this is enough to give us the basis to just assume their consent if they don't reply.

0:14:43	SPEAKER_01
 But I'm not, you know, me not being a lawyer, I wouldn't just want to do that without having the the expert.

0:14:51	SPEAKER_05
 I think we had better find out so that we can find out.

0:14:53	SPEAKER_02
 These people are either email almost all the time.

0:14:56	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_02
 I really don't see that it's a problem. I think that it's a common courtesy to ask them to expect for them to be able to have.

0:15:06	SPEAKER_02
 Try to contact them in just in case they had.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_02
 I think they appreciate it.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, my, my view before was about the nature of what was of the presentation of how my, the things that were questioning were along the lines of how easy.

0:15:23	SPEAKER_07
 How, how much implication would there be that it's likely you're going to be changing something as opposed to that was the kind of dispute I was making before.

0:15:32	SPEAKER_07
 But the attorneys, I guarantee you the attorneys will always come back with, we have to decide how stringent we want to be in these things, but they will always come back saying that you need to, you want to have something, some paper trail, or which includes electronic trail, that they have in fact, OK, did.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_07
 So I think that if you, if we send the email as you have it, if there's half the people say who don't respond at all by some period of time, we can just make a list of these people and hand it to, you know, just give it to me, you know, hand to the minister, or whatever, and they'll just call them up and say, you know, have you, is this OK? Would you please mail, mail, Adam that it is if it is or not.

0:16:20	SPEAKER_03
 So the other thing that there's a psychological effect that leads to most people that if they've responded to your email saying, yes, I will do it or yes, I got your email, they're more likely to actually do it later, then to just ignore it.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_03
 And of course, we don't want them to bleep things out, but it's a little bit better for getting their final response once they've answered you once, then if they never answer you at all, at all.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_03
 So I mean, it's not completely lost work because it might benefit us in terms of getting responses, you know, an official OK from somebody is better than no answer, even if they've responded that they got your email, and they're probably more likely to do that once they've responded that they got the email.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_02
 I also think they just simply appreciate it. I think it's a good way of fostering good will on our subjects.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_07
 I think the main thing is, I mean, what lawyers do is they always look at worst cases. So that's what they're paid to do. And so it is certainly possible that somebody's server would be down or something and they wouldn't actually hear from us and then they find this thing is in there and we've already distributed someone.

0:17:24	SPEAKER_07
 So what it says in there, in fact, is that they will be given an opportunity to blah, blah, blah.

0:17:29	SPEAKER_07
 But in fact, if we sent them something, we thought we sent them something, but they didn't actually receive it for some reason, then we haven't given them.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_05
 So how far do we have to go? Do we need to get someone's signature or is email enough? Do we have to have it noterized? I mean.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_07
 Email is now.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, I've been through this, I mean, not a lawyer, but I've been through these things. Things are like this a few times with lawyers now. So I'm pretty comfortable with that.

0:17:56	SPEAKER_06
 Do you track when people log in?

0:18:01	SPEAKER_05
 If they submit the form, I get it. If they don't submit the form, it goes in the general web log, but that's not sufficient.

0:18:08	SPEAKER_05
 Because if someone just visits the website, that doesn't imply anything in particular.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_06
 Except that you know they got the mail, right?

0:18:15	SPEAKER_02
 That's right. I could give to you on the number five list if you want me to.

0:18:18	SPEAKER_05
 I'm already on it.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_02
 For that directory?

0:18:21	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, great.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_07
 So again, hopefully this shouldn't be quite as odious a problem either way.

0:18:30	SPEAKER_07
 Any of the extremes we've talked about because we're talking a pretty small-

0:18:36	SPEAKER_05
 For this set, I'm not worried because we basically know everyone on it. They're all more or less here or it's Eric and Dan and so on.

0:18:45	SPEAKER_05
 But for some of the others, you're talking about visitors who are gone from XC, who email addresses may or may not work.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_05
 So what are we going to do when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with?

0:18:58	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think there's so recent these visitors.

0:19:01	SPEAKER_02
 And they're also so prominent enough they're easy to find through.

0:19:07	SPEAKER_02
 Other methods?

0:19:08	SPEAKER_02
 I'll be able to, if you have any trouble finding them, I really think I could find them.

0:19:11	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, because what it really does promise here is that we will ask their permission.

0:19:19	SPEAKER_07
 And I think if you go into a room and close the door and ask their permission, they're not there.

0:19:24	SPEAKER_07
 It doesn't seem that's the intent of meaning here.

0:19:28	SPEAKER_05
 Well, the question is just whether how active it has to be.

0:19:31	SPEAKER_05
 I mean because they filled out a contact information and that's where I'm sending the information.

0:19:35	SPEAKER_05
 And so far everyone has done email.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_05
 There isn't anyone who did any other contact method.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_07
 Well, the way XC goes, people who were here 10 years ago still have forwards to other counts and so on.

0:19:48	SPEAKER_07
 So it's unusual.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_05
 So my original impression was that that was sufficient.

0:19:53	SPEAKER_05
 That if they give us contact information, that contact information isn't accurate.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_05
 That we've fulfilled our bird.

0:20:00	SPEAKER_07
 So if we get to a boundary case like that, then maybe I will call the attorney about it.

0:20:05	SPEAKER_07
 But hopefully we won't need to.

0:20:07	SPEAKER_02
 I just don't think we will.

0:20:08	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_02
 For all the reasons that we've discussed.

0:20:10	SPEAKER_02
 So we'll see.

0:20:11	SPEAKER_05
 We'll see how many people respond to that email.

0:20:13	SPEAKER_05
 So far two people have.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I think very few people will.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_07
 And people see long emails about things that they don't think.

0:20:20	SPEAKER_07
 It's going to be high priority.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_07
 They typically don't.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_07
 Don't read it or have read it.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_07
 Right.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_07
 Because people I swamped.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_02
 And actually, I didn't anticipate this.

0:20:30	SPEAKER_02
 So that's why I didn't give this comment.

0:20:32	SPEAKER_02
 And this discussion has made me think it might be nice to have a follow-up email within the next couple of days saying, by the way, we want to hear back from you by X date.

0:20:46	SPEAKER_02
 And then add what Liz said.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_02
 Please respond.

0:20:48	SPEAKER_02
 Please indicate you received this mail.

0:20:50	SPEAKER_07
 Or maybe even additionally.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_07
 Even if you've decided you have no changes you'd like to make if you could respond to that.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_03
 That would definitely work on me.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_03
 It makes you feel like if you're predicting that you might not answer.

0:21:08	SPEAKER_03
 You have a chance now to say that.

0:21:11	SPEAKER_03
 Whereas, I mean, I would be much more likely myself.

0:21:14	SPEAKER_03
 And yet, all my email to respond at that point saying, you know what, I'm probably not going to get to it or whatever.

0:21:19	SPEAKER_03
 Rather than just having seen the email thinking I might get to it and never really pushing myself to actually do it until it's too late.

0:21:26	SPEAKER_06
 I was thinking that it also lets them know that they don't have to go to the page to accept this.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_06
 That's true.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, so that way they can see from that email that if they just write back and say I got it, no changes.

0:21:39	SPEAKER_06
 They're off the hook.

0:21:40	SPEAKER_06
 They don't have to go to the webpage.

0:21:41	SPEAKER_07
 The other thing I've learned from dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth is if you say you've got three months to do this review, people do it two and seven eighths months from now.

0:21:54	SPEAKER_07
 Right.

0:21:55	SPEAKER_07
 So you've got three weeks to do this review.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_07
 They do two and seven eighths weeks from now.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_07
 They do the review.

0:22:00	SPEAKER_07
 And so if we make it a little less time, I don't think it will be that.

0:22:06	SPEAKER_05
 Well, and also if we want it ready by the 15th, that means we better give them deadline of the first.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_05
 If we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time.

0:22:14	SPEAKER_07
 There's the responding part in there is also what if, I mean, hopefully this doesn't happen.

0:22:19	SPEAKER_07
 What if there are a bunch of deletions that have to get put in the changes, then we actually have to deal with that if we want it to.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_05
 Diskspace.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_05
 Oh my god.

0:22:27	SPEAKER_05
 I hadn't thought about that for every meeting, any meeting which has any bleeps in it, we need yet another copy of.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_05
 Just get to that channel.

0:22:38	SPEAKER_05
 Oh no, we need all the channels.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_05
 Do you have to do the other close talk?

0:22:43	SPEAKER_05
 Yes, absolutely.

0:22:44	SPEAKER_05
 You could just log across talk.

0:22:46	SPEAKER_05
 Well, you have to copy the whole file, right, because we're going to be releasing the whole file.

0:22:53	SPEAKER_02
 I think at a certain point that copy that has the deletions will become the master copy.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it's just I hate deleting any data.

0:23:00	SPEAKER_05
 So I don't want, I really would rather make a copy of it rather than bleep it out.

0:23:05	SPEAKER_07
 Are you bleeping it by adding?

0:23:07	SPEAKER_05
 Overlapping.

0:23:09	SPEAKER_05
 So it's exactly a sensor bleep.

0:23:12	SPEAKER_05
 So what I really think is bleep.

0:23:14	SPEAKER_07
 Is it summing signals or do you delete the old one and put the new one?

0:23:19	SPEAKER_07
 I delete the old one and put the new one.

0:23:20	SPEAKER_05
 There's nothing left of the original.

0:23:21	SPEAKER_07
 Because if you're summing, it could, anyway.

0:23:24	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, it's easy to get it back again.

0:23:26	SPEAKER_02
 And then I was going to say also they, they don't have to say on the system as you know, because once it's been successfully bleeped.

0:23:34	SPEAKER_02
 We'll tell people to free.

0:23:35	SPEAKER_02
 You can hide it, yeah.

0:23:36	SPEAKER_02
 Can't you rely on the art heart?

0:23:38	SPEAKER_04
 We got that.

0:23:39	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, that's true.

0:23:40	SPEAKER_04
 To hide it.

0:23:41	SPEAKER_04
 You can crypt it.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_07
 If you sponsor it with it, too hide it.

0:23:44	SPEAKER_07
 Here we go.

0:23:45	SPEAKER_01
 There you go.

0:23:46	SPEAKER_01
 There you go.

0:23:49	SPEAKER_01
 Like people say what they said.

0:23:52	SPEAKER_04
 And you have like subliminal.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_05
 You've seen the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments.

0:23:58	SPEAKER_05
 Did you read that paper?

0:23:59	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:24:00	SPEAKER_05
 It wouldn't work.

0:24:01	SPEAKER_05
 The speech recognizer still works.

0:24:02	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:24:03	SPEAKER_03
 And if you do it backwards.

0:24:05	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_06
 That's because they use forward backwards.

0:24:07	SPEAKER_06
 Forward backwards.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_05
 Forward backwards.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_05
 That's right.

0:24:10	SPEAKER_05
 Good point.

0:24:11	SPEAKER_05
 A point.

0:24:13	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I'm sorry if I sound a little peeved about this whole thing.

0:24:15	SPEAKER_05
 It's just we've had meeting after meeting after meeting on this.

0:24:18	SPEAKER_05
 And it seems like we've never gotten it resolved.

0:24:20	SPEAKER_07
 Well, we've never also, we've also never done it.

0:24:23	SPEAKER_07
 It's the first time we've been releasing widgets the first time through.

0:24:26	SPEAKER_07
 And I'm sorry responding without having much knowledge.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_07
 But the thing is I am like one of these people who gets the gazillion males.

0:24:32	SPEAKER_07
 Well, that's exactly why I did it the way I did it.

0:24:35	SPEAKER_05
 Which is the default is if you do nothing, we're going to release it.

0:24:37	SPEAKER_05
 Because I have my stack of emails to be done.

0:24:42	SPEAKER_05
 That 50 or 60 long.

0:24:44	SPEAKER_05
 And the ones at the top, I'm never going to get to.

0:24:46	SPEAKER_05
 Right.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_05
 So the only thing we're missing is wait and then you respond easily to say,

0:24:52	SPEAKER_07
 okay, you're going to have a mail-in deer.

0:24:54	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, that's actually definitely a good point. The email doesn't specify that you can just reply to the email as opposed to going to the forum.

0:25:03	SPEAKER_02
 And it also doesn't give a specific, I didn't think of it.

0:25:06	SPEAKER_02
 So I think it's a good idea.

0:25:08	SPEAKER_02
 And explicit time by which this will be considered.

0:25:11	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, release.

0:25:12	SPEAKER_02
 And it has to be time earlier than that endpoint.

0:25:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:25:15	SPEAKER_07
 It's converging.

0:25:17	SPEAKER_01
 I've seen this recently.

0:25:19	SPEAKER_01
 I got the email.

0:25:20	SPEAKER_01
 And if I use a mind-capable mail reader, it actually says, you know, click on this button to confirm receipt of the mail.

0:25:30	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, that's interesting.

0:25:32	SPEAKER_05
 You can, a lot of mailers support return receipt.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_01
 Right.

0:25:36	SPEAKER_05
 But it doesn't confirm that they've read it.

0:25:37	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, this is different.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_01
 This is not, so I know you can tell, you know, the mail delivery agent to confirm that the mail was delivered to your mailbox.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_01
 But no, this was different.

0:25:47	SPEAKER_01
 In the mail, there was a...

0:25:49	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, just a button.

0:25:51	SPEAKER_01
 There was a button that when you clicked on it, it would send, you know, actual acknowledgments to the center that you had actually looked at the mail.

0:26:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, we could do that, but I hate that.

0:26:02	SPEAKER_01
 But it only works for, you know, mind-capable, you know, if you use a landscape or something.

0:26:06	SPEAKER_07
 It does respond to the mail.

0:26:08	SPEAKER_07
 And we actually need a third thing.

0:26:09	SPEAKER_07
 It's not that you've looked at it.

0:26:10	SPEAKER_07
 And you've looked at it and agree with one of the possible actions, right?

0:26:15	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, you can do that.

0:26:16	SPEAKER_01
 You can put this button anywhere you want.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, I see.

0:26:19	SPEAKER_01
 And say here by clicking on this, I agree.

0:26:22	SPEAKER_07
 I acknowledge my first born children are yours.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:26:27	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:26:28	SPEAKER_03
 Quick question.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_05
 Well, I could put a URL in there without any difficulty.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_05
 And even pretty simple mind readers can do that.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_02
 But why shouldn't they just email back?

0:26:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, reply.

0:26:38	SPEAKER_02
 It's very nice. I like the high tech aspect.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_01
 I actually don't.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_01
 Appreciate it.

0:26:43	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not.

0:26:44	SPEAKER_05
 I use a text mail.

0:26:45	SPEAKER_03
 You use Vi?

0:26:46	SPEAKER_07
 Oh, that's my guy.

0:26:49	SPEAKER_05
 You use the VI?

0:26:51	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:52	SPEAKER_01
 There's these logos that you can put at the bottom of your webpage, like powered by Vi.

0:26:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:26:58	SPEAKER_01
 Wow.

0:26:59	SPEAKER_05
 You can put web bugs in the email.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_03
 There were three meetings this time or six, but of different people.

0:27:06	SPEAKER_03
 So I guess if you're in both these types of meetings, you'd have a lot.

0:27:09	SPEAKER_03
 But how, I mean, it also depends on how many, like, if we release this time, it's a fairly small number of meetings.

0:27:16	SPEAKER_03
 But what if we release like 25 meetings to people?

0:27:19	SPEAKER_05
 Well, what my expectation is is that we'll send out one of these emails every time a meeting has been checked and is ready.

0:27:26	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, okay.

0:27:27	SPEAKER_05
 So that was my intention.

0:27:28	SPEAKER_05
 It's just, yeah, that we just happen to have a bunch all at once.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_05
 That's a good idea.

0:27:32	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, maybe is that the way it's going to be, Jane?

0:27:34	SPEAKER_02
 We could do it. I'd be happy with either way.

0:27:36	SPEAKER_02
 Batch wise, what I was thinking, so this one, that was exactly right, that we had a...

0:27:40	SPEAKER_02
 I had wanted to get the entire set of 12 hours ready.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_02
 Don't have it.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_02
 But this was the biggest clump I could do by a time where I thought it was reasonable.

0:27:49	SPEAKER_02
 People would be able to check it and still have it ready by then.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_02
 I was thinking that with the NSA meetings, I liked there are three of them.

0:27:56	SPEAKER_02
 And there...

0:27:57	SPEAKER_02
 I will have them done by Monday.

0:28:00	SPEAKER_02
 Unfortunately, the time is later and I don't know how that's going to work out.

0:28:03	SPEAKER_02
 But I thought it'd be good to have that release as a clump too, because then, you know, they have a...

0:28:08	SPEAKER_02
 It's in a category.

0:28:09	SPEAKER_02
 It's not quite so distracting to them is what I was thinking and so on and once.

0:28:12	SPEAKER_02
 But after that, when we're caught up a bit on this process, then I could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_02
 I could do it either way.

0:28:21	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, it's a question of how distracting these to the people who have to do the checking.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_07
 You hear anything?

0:28:29	SPEAKER_06
 Maybe I'm...

0:28:33	SPEAKER_06
 Let's see.

0:28:34	SPEAKER_06
 Right.

0:28:35	SPEAKER_06
 So we got the transcript back from that one meeting.

0:28:36	SPEAKER_06
 Everything seemed fine.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_06
 Adam had a script that will put everything back together and there was one small problem, but it was a simple thing to fix.

0:28:43	SPEAKER_06
 And then, I sent him pointer to three more.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_06
 And so he's off and working...

0:28:52	SPEAKER_05
 Now we haven't actually had anyone go through that meeting to see whether the transcript is correct and to see how much was missed and all that sort of stuff.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_05
 So at some point, you need to do that.

0:29:00	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, that's on my list.

0:29:01	SPEAKER_06
 Yeah, it's going to have to go through our regular...

0:29:04	SPEAKER_05
 I mean, the one thing I noticed is it did miss a lot of back channels.

0:29:06	SPEAKER_05
 There are a fair number of yes and a-huzz that it's just that aren't in there.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_07
 But I think, yeah, you see, that's going to be our standard process.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_07
 That's what the transcript was doing.

0:29:17	SPEAKER_07
 I would imagine once.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_07
 Yes, absolutely.

0:29:19	SPEAKER_02
 One question about the back channels.

0:29:21	SPEAKER_02
 Do you suppose that was because they weren't caught by the pre-segmenter?

0:29:24	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, absolutely.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, interesting.

0:29:26	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, they're not in the segment.

0:29:29	SPEAKER_05
 It's not that the IBM people didn't do it.

0:29:32	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:29:33	SPEAKER_02
 Just they didn't get marked.

0:29:34	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so maybe when the detector for that, it's better or something.

0:29:37	SPEAKER_02
 There's another issue, which is this...

0:29:39	SPEAKER_02
 We've been contacted by University of Washington now, of course, to...

0:29:43	SPEAKER_02
 We sent them the transcripts that correspond to those six meetings.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_02
 And they're downloading the audio files.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_02
 So I'll be doing that.

0:29:51	SPEAKER_02
 Check...

0:29:52	SPEAKER_02
 Check that...

0:29:53	SPEAKER_02
 Put that in.

0:29:54	SPEAKER_06
 I pointed them to the set that Andreas put on the web so that they want to compare directly with his results they can.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_06
 And then once...

0:30:05	SPEAKER_06
 We can also point them at the original meetings.

0:30:10	SPEAKER_06
 They can grab those too with...

0:30:12	SPEAKER_03
 Do you put the reference files?

0:30:14	SPEAKER_06
 No, no.

0:30:15	SPEAKER_06
 They wanted the audio.

0:30:16	SPEAKER_06
 Jane sent them the transcripts.

0:30:17	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, I have the transcripts.

0:30:19	SPEAKER_03
 Well, we can talk about offline.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_05
 There's another meeting in here, what, at four.

0:30:26	SPEAKER_05
 Right?

0:30:27	SPEAKER_05
 Yes, so we have to finish by 345.

0:30:29	SPEAKER_01
 So the...

0:30:30	SPEAKER_01
 Does UW want to use the state of for recognition or something else?

0:30:35	SPEAKER_06
 For recognition.

0:30:36	SPEAKER_03
 I think they're doing what...

0:30:37	SPEAKER_03
 Didn't they want to do language modeling on, you know, recognition compatible transcripts?

0:30:41	SPEAKER_02
 This is to show you some of the things that turn up during the checking procedure.

0:30:46	SPEAKER_02
 So this is from one of the NSA meetings.

0:30:48	SPEAKER_02
 And if you're familiar with the DIF format, the arrow to the left is what it was.

0:30:52	SPEAKER_02
 And the arrow to the right is what it was changed to.

0:30:55	SPEAKER_02
 So, now the first one.

0:30:57	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so then we start at weekly meeting.

0:30:59	SPEAKER_02
 The last time on the transcriber thought little too much, but really it was we learned too much, which makes more sense syntactically as well.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_02
 And these departancies were...

0:31:11	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, that's the convention for indicating uncertain.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_02
 So the transcriber was right.

0:31:15	SPEAKER_02
 You know, she was uncertain about that.

0:31:17	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:31:18	SPEAKER_02
 She's right to be uncertain.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_02
 And it's also a good indication of the next one.

0:31:22	SPEAKER_02
 This was about Claudia, and she'd been really busy with stuff such as waivers.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:31:29	SPEAKER_02
 Next one.

0:31:31	SPEAKER_02
 This was an interesting one.

0:31:33	SPEAKER_02
 So the original was...

0:31:34	SPEAKER_02
 So Claudia is not the bad master here.

0:31:37	SPEAKER_02
 And then he'll ask, but it's really a lot of master.

0:31:40	SPEAKER_02
 And he's another type of uncertainty, which is, you know, they just didn't know what to make out of that.

0:31:45	SPEAKER_02
 So instead of split upon unknown, it's split in principle.

0:31:48	SPEAKER_04
 So I'm saying these are from IBM, the top line.

0:31:50	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, these are local transcriptions of the NSA meetings.

0:31:54	SPEAKER_02
 Transcribers version versus the checked version.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, I see.

0:31:58	SPEAKER_02
 My checked version, which I go through it.

0:32:00	SPEAKER_02
 Then you get down here.

0:32:02	SPEAKER_02
 Sometimes some speakers will insert foreign language terms.

0:32:05	SPEAKER_02
 That's the next example, the next one.

0:32:07	SPEAKER_02
 The version beyond this is so instead of saying, or especially those words, also in older and some other ones, those sneak in.

0:32:17	SPEAKER_02
 The next one.

0:32:18	SPEAKER_02
 This is called...

0:32:19	SPEAKER_02
 This is called...

0:32:20	SPEAKER_02
 Sorry, what?

0:32:21	SPEAKER_01
 Discourse on...

0:32:22	SPEAKER_01
 This is called...

0:32:23	SPEAKER_02
 And it makes sense because it's like below this...

0:32:24	SPEAKER_02
 It's a little subliminal there.

0:32:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, next one.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_02
 This is a term, a problem with terminology.

0:32:30	SPEAKER_02
 Description with...

0:32:31	SPEAKER_02
 The transcriber is X as an advance, but really it's QS in advance.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, I've benefited from some of these cross-group meetings.

0:32:39	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, then you got...

0:32:41	SPEAKER_02
 Instead of from something or other cards, it's for a multi-cast.

0:32:45	SPEAKER_02
 Instead of...

0:32:47	SPEAKER_02
 And system related, it's in system related.

0:32:49	SPEAKER_02
 This was changed to an acronym initially and it shouldn't have been.

0:32:52	SPEAKER_02
 And then you can see here, GPS was misinterpreted.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_02
 It's just totally understanding.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_02
 This is a lot of jargon.

0:33:01	SPEAKER_02
 And the final one, the transcriber in the core network itself, or the exit unknown, not the internet unknown, and it comes through as in the core network itself of the access provider, not the internet backbone core.

0:33:14	SPEAKER_02
 This is a lot of terminology.

0:33:16	SPEAKER_02
 And they're generally extremely good.

0:33:18	SPEAKER_02
 But, you know, in this area, it really does pay to double check.

0:33:22	SPEAKER_02
 And I'm hoping that when the checked versions are run through the recognizer that you'll see substantial improvements in performance, because there are a lot of these in there.

0:33:31	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah, but I bet they're acoustically challenging parts anyway, though.

0:33:35	SPEAKER_05
 I actually know.

0:33:36	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, really?

0:33:37	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, so it's just jargon.

0:33:38	SPEAKER_02
 It's jargon.

0:33:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I mean, this is because, you know, you don't realize in daily life how much you have top-down influences in what you're hearing.

0:33:45	SPEAKER_02
 And it's jargon coupled with a foreign accent.

0:33:47	SPEAKER_01
 But we don't, I mean, our language model right now doesn't know about these words anyhow.

0:33:51	SPEAKER_01
 So, you know, until you actually get a decent language model, add up a certain one to your problem.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_01
 It's a different one.

0:33:58	SPEAKER_01
 But it's definitely good that these are fixed, I mean, obviously.

0:34:02	SPEAKER_02
 Well, also from the standpoint of getting people's approval, because if someone sees a page full of barely desirable sentences, and then it's asked to prove it or not, it's not.

0:34:12	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:13	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, that would be the same with people.

0:34:15	SPEAKER_07
 So, well, I don't approve it because it's not what I said.

0:34:18	SPEAKER_05
 Well, that's exactly right.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_05
 The extra option in.

0:34:20	SPEAKER_05
 It's that I was afraid people would say, let's censor that because it's wrong, and I don't want them to do that.

0:34:25	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:34:26	SPEAKER_02
 And then I also, the final thing I have for transcription is that I made a purchase of some other headphones because of the problem of low gain and the originals.

0:34:33	SPEAKER_02
 And they very much prefer the new ones.

0:34:37	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, I think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the choice.

0:34:41	SPEAKER_02
 We originally chosen very expensive headsets, but they're just not as good as these with respect to this particular test.

0:34:51	SPEAKER_05
 It's probably impeding, smatching problems.

0:34:54	SPEAKER_02
 I don't know, but we chose them because that's what's been used here by prominent projects in transcription.

0:34:58	SPEAKER_02
 So, every reason they think they would work.

0:35:01	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, spare headsets.

0:35:02	SPEAKER_05
 They're just earphones.

0:35:03	SPEAKER_05
 They're not headsets.

0:35:04	SPEAKER_05
 They're not microphones.

0:35:05	SPEAKER_01
 No, no, I mean earphones.

0:35:08	SPEAKER_01
 Because I could use one of my workstations just to do something I have to listen to audio files and I don't have to go borrow it from someone.

0:35:18	SPEAKER_02
 Actually, I have...

0:35:20	SPEAKER_02
 The thing is that if we have four people come to work for a day, I was hanging on to the others for spare spare.

0:35:26	SPEAKER_02
 No, but if you knew it, just get it.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, we should get it.

0:35:29	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I need it.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_07
 It's just something to get a pair too.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_04
 They're pretty inexpensive.

0:35:34	SPEAKER_04
 I'm using one of these.

0:35:35	SPEAKER_04
 Two or three or four X-ray.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_01
 I think I haven't had that I brought from home, but it's just from you.

0:35:39	SPEAKER_01
 Just buy them.

0:35:40	SPEAKER_07
 Where do you buy these from?

0:35:42	SPEAKER_02
 Cambridge Soundworks.

0:35:43	SPEAKER_02
 Just down the street.

0:35:44	SPEAKER_02
 You just go and...

0:35:45	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_02
 They want to have them stock.

0:35:47	SPEAKER_05
 Good idea.

0:35:48	SPEAKER_05
 Do you email out the brand?

0:35:49	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, sure.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:35:51	SPEAKER_05
 It sounds like people are interested.

0:35:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's made a difference in...

0:35:54	SPEAKER_07
 I realize something I should talk about.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_07
 So, what's the other thing on the agenda?

0:35:58	SPEAKER_05
 The only one was Don wanted to talk about disc space yet again.

0:36:02	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:36:03	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, it's short.

0:36:04	SPEAKER_04
 I mean, if you want to go, we just want to go.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_04
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

0:36:06	SPEAKER_04
 It's short.

0:36:07	SPEAKER_04
 Well, you met the disc space.

0:36:08	SPEAKER_05
 No, we know the disc space.

0:36:09	SPEAKER_03
 That's a great ambiguity.

0:36:10	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_03
 It's one of the...

0:36:12	SPEAKER_03
 It's social and it's level.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:15	SPEAKER_03
 It's great.

0:36:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:36:17	SPEAKER_03
 It was really cool.

0:36:18	SPEAKER_03
 See if I had that little crack head, I would have made an X there.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_05
 Well, we'll give you one, man.

0:36:23	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah.

0:36:24	SPEAKER_04
 So, without thinking about it, when I offered up my hard drive last week, oh no.

0:36:30	SPEAKER_04
 That's not a big surprise.

0:36:33	SPEAKER_04
 No, I realized that we're going to be doing a lot of experiments for this paper we're writing.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_04
 So, we're probably going to need a lot more.

0:36:43	SPEAKER_04
 We're probably going to need that disc space that we had on the 18 gig hard drive.

0:36:47	SPEAKER_04
 But we also have someone else coming in that's going to help us out with some stuff.

0:36:50	SPEAKER_07
 We just ordered a hundred gigabytes.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_03
 We just need to...

0:36:54	SPEAKER_03
 We just need to...

0:36:55	SPEAKER_07
 We're getting 336s.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:36:57	SPEAKER_07
 That are going into the main file.

0:37:00	SPEAKER_04
 Mark, well, you're so...

0:37:01	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I mean, I guess the thing is, is all I need is to hang it off like the person who's coming in, so now all these computer...

0:37:07	SPEAKER_01
 You mean the...

0:37:08	SPEAKER_01
 The disc...

0:37:09	SPEAKER_01
 Or we can move them.

0:37:10	SPEAKER_01
 Or machines that we just got?

0:37:11	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:37:12	SPEAKER_01
 Or...

0:37:13	SPEAKER_04
 These are going to go on to discs.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_04
 So, are we going to move the stuff off of my hard drive onto that when those come in?

0:37:16	SPEAKER_04
 Let's take a minute.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_06
 Sure.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:37:19	SPEAKER_06
 Do you find it one of those plan for?

0:37:20	SPEAKER_06
 They should be...

0:37:21	SPEAKER_06
 I imagine next week or something.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:37:23	SPEAKER_05
 So, for desperate, I have some space on my drive, but I...

0:37:27	SPEAKER_05
 I think if I...

0:37:29	SPEAKER_04
 I vacillate between no space free and a few gigs.

0:37:30	SPEAKER_04
 Yeah, I think I can find something if I'm desperate.

0:37:32	SPEAKER_04
 And in the meantime, I'll just hold out.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_04
 That was the only thing I wanted to bring out.

0:37:34	SPEAKER_04
 It should be soon.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:37:36	SPEAKER_07
 So, there's another hundred gigs.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_04
 All right. Great.

0:37:38	SPEAKER_07
 That's it.

0:37:39	SPEAKER_07
 It's great to be able to do that.

0:37:40	SPEAKER_07
 I just say, oh yeah.

0:37:41	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:37:42	SPEAKER_03
 A hundred gig year, 100 gig there.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_03
 It's eventually.

0:37:44	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:45	SPEAKER_05
 Real disc space.

0:37:46	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:37:47	None
 Yeah.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:37:49	SPEAKER_07
 I was just going to comment that I'm going to be on the phone with Mark.

0:37:52	SPEAKER_07
 I'm going to be on the phone with Marie tomorrow.

0:37:54	SPEAKER_07
 Good afternoon.

0:37:55	SPEAKER_07
 We're supposed to get together and talk about where we are on things.

0:38:01	SPEAKER_07
 There's this meeting coming up.

0:38:03	SPEAKER_07
 And there's also an annual report.

0:38:05	SPEAKER_07
 And I never actually...

0:38:06	SPEAKER_07
 I was asking about this.

0:38:07	SPEAKER_07
 I don't really quite understand this.

0:38:09	SPEAKER_07
 She was referring to it as...

0:38:12	SPEAKER_07
 I think this actually didn't just come from her, but this is what the ARPA had asked for.

0:38:18	SPEAKER_07
 She was referring to it as an annual report for the fiscal year.

0:38:21	SPEAKER_07
 Of course, the fiscal year starts in October.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_07
 So I don't quite understand how we do an annual report that...

0:38:27	SPEAKER_07
 She's either related really early.

0:38:29	SPEAKER_05
 Or she's getting good early start.

0:38:32	SPEAKER_07
 I think basically it's none of those meetings in July.

0:38:35	SPEAKER_07
 So the so-dabr to said do an annual report.

0:38:38	SPEAKER_07
 So anyway, I'll be putting together stuff.

0:38:42	SPEAKER_07
 I'll do it as much as I can without bothering people just by looking at papers and status reports.

0:38:47	SPEAKER_07
 I mean, the status reports you do are very helpful.

0:38:49	SPEAKER_07
 So I can grab stuff there.

0:38:51	SPEAKER_07
 If I have some questions.

0:38:53	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, if people could do it as soon as you can if you haven't done one.

0:38:57	SPEAKER_07
 Recently.

0:38:59	SPEAKER_07
 But, you know, I'm sure before it's all done on debugging people for more clarification about stuff.

0:39:07	SPEAKER_07
 But I don't know.

0:39:09	SPEAKER_07
 I guess I know pretty much what people have been doing.

0:39:13	SPEAKER_07
 We have these meetings and there's the status reports.

0:39:18	SPEAKER_07
 But, yeah, so that wasn't a long one just to tell you that.

0:39:24	SPEAKER_07
 And if something hasn't...

0:39:26	SPEAKER_07
 I'll be talking to you later tomorrow afternoon.

0:39:28	SPEAKER_07
 If something hasn't been in the status report and you think it's an important thing to mention.

0:39:32	SPEAKER_07
 This kind of thing just popped me online.

0:39:35	SPEAKER_07
 And I'll have it in front of me for the phone conversation.

0:39:41	SPEAKER_07
 I guess you're still packing away at the demos and all that.

0:39:49	SPEAKER_05
 And Donna's gonna be helping out with that.

0:39:53	SPEAKER_05
 Do you want to talk about that this afternoon?

0:39:55	SPEAKER_04
 I'm here, but later today.

0:39:57	SPEAKER_04
 We should probably talk offline about when we're gonna talk offline.

0:40:01	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:40:02	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, I might want to get updated about it in about a week.

0:40:05	SPEAKER_07
 Because I'm actually gonna have a few days off the following week after the picnic.

0:40:12	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:40:15	SPEAKER_07
 So I had...

0:40:17	SPEAKER_05
 So we were gonna do sort of status of speech transcription, automatic transcription, but we're kind of running late.

0:40:25	SPEAKER_03
 How long does it take you to save the data?

0:40:27	SPEAKER_05
 15 minutes.

0:40:28	SPEAKER_05
 Yeah.

0:40:29	SPEAKER_05
 So, if you want to do a quick 10 minute.

0:40:33	SPEAKER_03
 It's really should stop like 20 oh, that the latest.

0:40:36	SPEAKER_03
 We have never a meeting coming in that they want to record.

0:40:39	SPEAKER_07
 And there's the digits to do.

0:40:41	SPEAKER_07
 Well, we can skip the digits.

0:40:42	SPEAKER_07
 Maybe we could five minute reporters.

0:40:45	SPEAKER_03
 Up to you.

0:40:46	SPEAKER_03
 Whatever you want.

0:40:47	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah.

0:40:48	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, we'd love to hear about this message.

0:40:49	SPEAKER_07
 I'm interested.

0:40:50	SPEAKER_07
 Yeah, well, I'm gonna be on the phone tomorrow.

0:40:51	SPEAKER_07
 So this is just a good example of sort of thing I'd like to hear about.

0:40:54	SPEAKER_07
 Wait, why is everybody looking at me?

0:40:56	SPEAKER_07
 Sorry.

0:40:57	SPEAKER_07
 Because he looked at you and she was just catching.

0:40:59	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not sure what you're doing.

0:41:01	SPEAKER_01
 Are we supposed to have done something?

0:41:03	SPEAKER_05
 We're just talking before about alternating the subject of the meeting.

0:41:07	SPEAKER_05
 And this week we were going to try to do automatic transcription status.

0:41:11	SPEAKER_05
 Oh, we sort of failed.

0:41:13	SPEAKER_05
 Right?

0:41:14	SPEAKER_05
 No.

0:41:15	SPEAKER_05
 Did we?

0:41:16	SPEAKER_05
 Did we?

0:41:17	SPEAKER_05
 Okay.

0:41:18	SPEAKER_05
 Okay, so now we have the schedule.

0:41:19	SPEAKER_05
 So next week we'll do automatic transcription status plus anything that's real timely.

0:41:22	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:41:23	SPEAKER_07
 Okay, shoot update.

0:41:24	SPEAKER_07
 I was going to stop that bullet.

0:41:26	SPEAKER_07
 Nicely done, there's.

0:41:27	SPEAKER_02
 I'll move on a few words.

0:41:34	SPEAKER_07
 But lots of pros.

0:41:38	SPEAKER_07
 Okay.

0:41:39	SPEAKER_01
 We really haven't done anything.

0:41:43	SPEAKER_01
 Excuse me?

0:41:44	SPEAKER_01
 Sorry.

0:41:45	SPEAKER_01
 The next thing on our agenda is to go back and look at the automatic alignments because I got some.

0:41:54	SPEAKER_01
 I learned from Tilo what data we can use as a benchmark to see how well we're doing automatic alignments.

0:42:03	SPEAKER_01
 So after that, I have the foreground speech with background speech.

0:42:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:42:07	SPEAKER_03
 And then I guess the new data that Dunn will start to process that when you can get these, you know, before we were working with these segments that were all synchronized and that caused a lot of problems.

0:42:19	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, right.

0:42:24	SPEAKER_03
 So sort of a stage two of trying the same kinds of alignments with the tighter boundaries.

0:42:28	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:42:29	SPEAKER_03
 Really the next step.

0:42:30	SPEAKER_03
 We did get our, I guess, good news.

0:42:32	SPEAKER_03
 We got our abstract accepted for this conference workshop, isco workshop in New Jersey.

0:42:49	SPEAKER_03
 But we're hoping to have a paper for that as well, which should be an interesting.

0:42:52	SPEAKER_03
 What's it to?

0:42:53	SPEAKER_03
 The tapers and do until August, the abstracts were already due, so it's that kind of workshop.

0:42:57	SPEAKER_03
 But I mean, the good news is that that will have sort of the European experts in pros.

0:43:01	SPEAKER_03
 It's sort of a different crowd.

0:43:03	SPEAKER_03
 I think we're the only people working on pros in meeting so far, so that should be interesting.

0:43:07	SPEAKER_03
 What's the name of the meeting?

0:43:09	SPEAKER_03
 It's, it's go workshop on pros in speech recognition and understanding or something like that, some generic.

0:43:19	SPEAKER_03
 So it's focused on using pros in automatic systems and there's a web page.

0:43:26	SPEAKER_07
 You're going to your speech?

0:43:29	SPEAKER_05
 I don't have a paper, but I kind of like to go if I could.

0:43:33	SPEAKER_05
 Is that all right?

0:43:34	SPEAKER_05
 We'll discuss it.

0:43:35	SPEAKER_06
 Okay.

0:43:36	SPEAKER_06
 My car needs a good wash.

0:43:38	SPEAKER_07
 Hey, that's what it takes.

0:43:41	SPEAKER_08
 I'll pick up your dry cleaning tape.

0:43:49	SPEAKER_05
 All right.

0:44:27	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, I'm going to exit because I have to be there.

0:44:30	SPEAKER_01
 Go for it.
