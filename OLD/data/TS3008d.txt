0:00:00	None
 or I

0:00:29	None
 Okay. You questioner.

0:00:31	None
 Oh, you questioner.

0:00:32	None
 I mean, you questioner.

0:00:34	None
 I mean, you know.

0:00:36	None
 No.

0:00:37	None
 Power by that.

0:00:38	None
 They will know it.

0:00:40	None
 It's a little sign on it.

0:00:48	SPEAKER_03
 Little round with a line.

0:00:53	None
 Okay.

0:00:54	SPEAKER_01
 Is it nice?

0:01:01	None
 Okay.

0:01:02	SPEAKER_00
 Welcome to the details design meeting.

0:01:23	SPEAKER_00
 Again, I'm going to take minutes.

0:01:26	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, we're going to have a prototype presentation first.

0:01:29	SPEAKER_00
 Who's going to give the prototype presentation?

0:01:33	SPEAKER_00
 You two guys?

0:01:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:01:35	SPEAKER_00
 Go ahead.

0:01:36	SPEAKER_01
 I'm going to help you.

0:01:50	None
 You have a common family.

0:01:55	None
 Okay.

0:01:57	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:05	SPEAKER_03
 We've made a prototype.

0:02:08	SPEAKER_03
 We've got our aspects from the last meeting, especially we looked at the form material and the color.

0:02:19	SPEAKER_03
 We've drawn here the prototype.

0:02:22	SPEAKER_03
 The logo is pretty obvious to see on the remote control, but it is necessary.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_03
 When you want to build your company to a level higher.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_03
 Our interface elements are shown in the drawing.

0:02:48	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you can point them.

0:02:51	SPEAKER_01
 Well, all functions are discussed.

0:02:55	SPEAKER_01
 I think the most of the functions are obvious.

0:03:00	SPEAKER_01
 It's a little bit power button.

0:03:05	SPEAKER_01
 Then the nine channels.

0:03:10	SPEAKER_01
 The volume at the side and the other side is the programs.

0:03:17	SPEAKER_01
 Then we have just two buttons.

0:03:20	SPEAKER_01
 We place them in the middle, the menu, and for the teletext.

0:03:25	SPEAKER_00
 No, the mute button.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_03
 The mute button is here.

0:03:31	SPEAKER_02
 You've got to point the out which is the volume button.

0:03:37	SPEAKER_01
 Most of them are right handed.

0:03:41	SPEAKER_02
 You've got to make it clear on that.

0:03:46	SPEAKER_02
 I don't have time at any point.

0:03:50	SPEAKER_02
 Next to that, I kind of miss the zero.

0:03:56	SPEAKER_02
 This was one thing I wanted to ask.

0:04:02	SPEAKER_00
 There are different ways for remote controls to do like, I call it teens and twenties.

0:04:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:04:12	SPEAKER_00
 Two numbers.

0:04:13	SPEAKER_02
 It's a television.

0:04:15	SPEAKER_00
 It's a television.

0:04:17	SPEAKER_00
 Do we need extra buttons?

0:04:22	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, you have a lot of standard buttons.

0:04:27	SPEAKER_03
 With the one and the double cross.

0:04:30	SPEAKER_00
 You don't need them.

0:04:33	SPEAKER_00
 A lot of remote controls work when you push the one first.

0:04:38	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think so.

0:04:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, you have televisions.

0:04:44	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think so, really.

0:04:47	SPEAKER_00
 You have to have remote controls that don't have these buttons, but you still can select the number in the twenties.

0:04:55	SPEAKER_02
 Remote control nowadays, they come with the television or the other way around.

0:05:02	SPEAKER_00
 No, I really think it's because when you put a button on it with one and then a dash, it's the same thing as when you just push the one.

0:05:13	SPEAKER_00
 Because it gives you the functionality of that separate button.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_00
 You also have to apply.

0:05:19	SPEAKER_03
 Some televisions don't accept that.

0:05:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, because it's for television, it's exactly the same thing.

0:05:25	SPEAKER_02
 No, no, no.

0:05:26	SPEAKER_02
 Some television respond differently.

0:05:28	SPEAKER_02
 No, listen, listen.

0:05:30	SPEAKER_00
 When you push the button, the remote control gives a signal.

0:05:33	SPEAKER_00
 In the first place, it gives a signal which it would also send when you put the separate button on it.

0:05:39	SPEAKER_00
 That the one with dash, that signal gives, and when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds, then the remote control gives the signal for channel one.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_00
 No, I think it works that way.

0:05:51	SPEAKER_02
 No, it works.

0:05:52	SPEAKER_02
 If you haven't got a special button for it, if you push the one, then on your television, there will appear one and a line.

0:06:00	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but it's exactly the same name that would appear when you put the separate button.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_03
 When you put all the televisions, you have to click on a special button, then you go to a next level.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_03
 You can push two buttons.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but you don't understand my point.

0:06:15	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's exactly the same thing.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, but some televisions don't support it.

0:06:19	SPEAKER_00
 No, but then they will also support that button because it's the same thing.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_00
 Listen, that special button, the way you're talking about that, it's just a signal to the TV that they have to put a one on your screen.

0:06:33	SPEAKER_00
 And a dash, so you can still put another number on it.

0:06:38	SPEAKER_00
 When you don't have the separate button and you push the one, it's exactly the same thing.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_00
 The remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only have to...

0:06:46	SPEAKER_02
 So, how can some televisions need the input first?

0:06:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but do you give the input?

0:06:51	SPEAKER_00
 No, they need the one.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_00
 That's the same thing as the button.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_00
 No, that's not true.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, it is.

0:06:56	SPEAKER_00
 Think about it.

0:06:57	SPEAKER_01
 It's simply not true.

0:06:58	SPEAKER_01
 No, but when you push the one, you can show on the telly one and just...

0:07:02	SPEAKER_01
 And it's the same thing where it happens.

0:07:04	SPEAKER_00
 And the remote control gives another signal after five seconds, that is just one.

0:07:08	SPEAKER_02
 Now, the remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds.

0:07:11	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control is a stupid thing.

0:07:13	SPEAKER_02
 If you push a button, it sends it immediately to the telly one.

0:07:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but I know for sure that some televisions that the remote control supplies only as the buttons with the one and the dash and the two and the dash.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_00
 But when you use a remote control that doesn't support these buttons, it still works.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_00
 But okay, we'll...

0:07:30	SPEAKER_00
 Definitely not.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_01
 Definitely not.

0:07:33	SPEAKER_01
 And usability lab.

0:07:34	SPEAKER_01
 No, we'll apply them then for now.

0:07:36	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know.

0:07:37	SPEAKER_01
 I don't know if it's necessary.

0:07:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, up next to the zero, the one and the two.

0:07:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think so.

0:07:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, for now, if we don't know for sure whether...

0:07:45	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, okay.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_03
 And the button for the SCART audio video external input.

0:07:54	SPEAKER_02
 You can access that file server on the right side.

0:07:56	SPEAKER_00
 When I said about it, the remote control sending another signal, that might not be true.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_00
 But I still think the old TVs in some way support it.

0:08:04	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_00
 No, no.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_00
 I think it's more...

0:08:07	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we both don't really understand how it is.

0:08:10	SPEAKER_00
 I would really work.

0:08:11	SPEAKER_00
 But I think there's more to it than remote control sends one signal at one button.

0:08:17	SPEAKER_03
 I do think that...

0:08:18	SPEAKER_00
 Some...

0:08:19	None
...

0:07:56	None
...

0:08:20	SPEAKER_00
...

0:08:21	SPEAKER_00
...

0:08:22	SPEAKER_03
...

0:08:23	SPEAKER_03
...

0:08:24	SPEAKER_03
...

0:08:25	SPEAKER_00
...

0:08:27	SPEAKER_00
...

0:08:29	SPEAKER_03
...

0:08:41	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, I'll always see.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_03
 When you make the technology that it will give more signals, it could work.

0:08:51	SPEAKER_03
 It's just the basic idea of the most common and simple operations on the remote.

0:09:04	SPEAKER_02
 I kind of missed the docking station.

0:09:06	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:09:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_03
 It's here.

0:09:09	SPEAKER_01
 And there's nothing.

0:09:17	SPEAKER_01
 I think it's pretty basic.

0:09:21	SPEAKER_01
 There's nothing really funny about it.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_01
 There's one function and that's the one function.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_03
 But maybe we can make the docking station a bit standard for the other products we sell.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_03
 Because real reaction sells more products than only remote controls.

0:09:42	SPEAKER_03
 So maybe we can use the docking station for example, MPD players or hearing devices.

0:09:50	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's very difficult because of different shapes of devices.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, but when you put the same photoises on it, you can put the lowest part of it.

0:10:04	SPEAKER_03
 When it's the same as the other products, you can put it all on the same...

0:10:10	SPEAKER_02
 Well, it has got to fit into the shape of course.

0:10:13	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, but we can make...

0:10:15	SPEAKER_02
 The technology and the voltage can be the same.

0:10:17	SPEAKER_02
 That's true.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_02
 But if you all make them having a bottom like this...

0:10:23	SPEAKER_03
 No, we can make the most lowest part all the same.

0:10:27	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that's true.

0:10:29	SPEAKER_03
 When the recharger has a bit that points out, we can place all on top of it.

0:10:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, but...

0:10:40	SPEAKER_02
 Which has to be big enough for the big...

0:10:42	SPEAKER_02
 If it's full then, it isn't going to fall down.

0:10:45	SPEAKER_02
 That's a bit...

0:10:47	SPEAKER_03
 No, when you make it large enough, it will not.

0:10:50	SPEAKER_03
 But then it's a little bit...

0:10:51	SPEAKER_02
 If, like this, I'll point it out.

0:10:53	SPEAKER_02
 If you've got...

0:10:54	SPEAKER_02
 But it's just an idea.

0:10:55	SPEAKER_02
 If it's like this, I won't draw it.

0:10:57	SPEAKER_02
 If you've got a base, which is...

0:10:59	SPEAKER_02
 It's as big as this.

0:11:00	SPEAKER_03
 It's as big as this.

0:11:01	SPEAKER_03
 So we can make all the products and flattens this.

0:11:05	SPEAKER_02
 But if you've got a tiny player, it can...

0:11:09	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, but when you make a bit of a big, low leaning...

0:11:13	SPEAKER_01
 It's leaning backwards, I think.

0:11:15	SPEAKER_02
 What you could do if you're from the bottom...

0:11:18	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, right.

0:11:20	SPEAKER_02
 But you could make it like a hole in it.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_03
 A little hole or...

0:11:25	SPEAKER_03
 A little project, go deeper in it.

0:11:28	SPEAKER_00
 Let's talk about the docking station later.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we have to consider the docking station anyway.

0:11:34	SPEAKER_00
 Because we have some...

0:11:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_00
 Cost issues.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_00
 It's still to come.

0:11:38	SPEAKER_00
 We have to look at that.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_03
 The look and feel would be great on this remote control.

0:11:42	SPEAKER_03
 I'm glad to call this.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_03
 You always will pick up the remote control in the smallest area.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_03
 Then your left thumb, your right thumb, is near the program button, which is the most common used function.

0:12:00	SPEAKER_03
 And all the other buttons are available for your thumb.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_03
 So it's a really good design.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:12:09	SPEAKER_03
 But that's it?

0:12:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, on the side, there will be a strip of rubber.

0:12:15	SPEAKER_03
 And in the middle, there's a hard material, a hard plastic, with light behind it.

0:12:23	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:12:24	SPEAKER_02
 And other lights.

0:12:25	SPEAKER_02
 I think you have the lights.

0:12:26	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, you can make also neon lights on it.

0:12:29	SPEAKER_02
 Or the buttons that can make lights on it.

0:12:33	SPEAKER_02
 Maybe the logo.

0:12:35	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_03
 But it will also use batteries.

0:12:41	SPEAKER_00
 And we want to.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:44	SPEAKER_00
 For now, this is good enough.

0:12:46	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:12:47	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:48	SPEAKER_00
 What was on the...

0:12:49	SPEAKER_03
 Did all the aspects of the interface buttons were...

0:12:53	None
 Okay.

0:12:54	SPEAKER_00
 But the color, because we're going to use one color for the plastic, and closer one color for the rubber.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:13:02	SPEAKER_00
 And we're going to do the buttons in the...

0:13:04	SPEAKER_00
 Or we're going to have rubber buttons.

0:13:06	SPEAKER_00
 And there will be the same color as the rubber on the side.

0:13:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:10	SPEAKER_00
 I think that'll be good enough.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_00
 I think we should use a darker color for the plastic, and maybe some more brighter and flashier.

0:13:17	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:13:18	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we can use on the lights on the side, we can use multiple lights.

0:13:23	SPEAKER_03
 So...

0:13:24	SPEAKER_03
 It will...

0:13:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_00
 We'll talk about the lights later.

0:13:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_00
 Because also, yeah, it depends on the costs and such.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:32	SPEAKER_00
 But...

0:13:33	SPEAKER_00
 And we have to agree upon the exact colors, but maybe I don't know if that's important, but we'll talk about it later.

0:13:37	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:13:38	SPEAKER_00
 For now, this is okay.

0:13:40	SPEAKER_00
 The next...

0:13:42	SPEAKER_00
 You're going to give a presentation too?

0:13:44	SPEAKER_00
 I have to see the...

0:13:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:46	SPEAKER_02
 I'm going to do something right there.

0:13:49	SPEAKER_00
 Detail design.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_02
 We've got to do that on the right.

0:13:52	SPEAKER_02
 On the right-most screen, because...

0:13:55	SPEAKER_02
 Evaluation criteria.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:13:58	SPEAKER_02
 That's me.

0:14:00	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:01	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:14:02	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_02
 I will be needing that image, so leave it, please.

0:14:07	SPEAKER_02
 Go away.

0:14:14	SPEAKER_02
 Right, we're going to evaluate that design.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_02
 According to a few points.

0:14:24	SPEAKER_02
 The four of us are going to do that together.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_02
 I want to have a color over here.

0:14:33	SPEAKER_02
 Come on.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_02
 Right.

0:14:35	SPEAKER_02
 The remote is not ugly, a bit weird sentence, but the positive thing has to be on the left, so I said not ugly instead of ugly.

0:14:45	SPEAKER_02
 What would you say?

0:14:47	SPEAKER_02
 We've got to give points to all of these to evaluate that design, and please forget the drawing skills of these guys.

0:14:57	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_02
 The remote controls are not ugly.

0:15:00	SPEAKER_02
 How do you feel?

0:15:02	SPEAKER_00
 I think four maybe would be appropriate because it really depends on taste.

0:15:08	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it's kind of dairy art design.

0:15:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:15:12	SPEAKER_00
 So maybe a lot of people find it really ugly, and other people find it really cool.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know how you think.

0:15:19	SPEAKER_00
 How do you guys feel?

0:15:20	SPEAKER_03
 I think the front will give it a more less earlier side, because you can make it in your own...

0:15:31	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, you can make it in your own...

0:15:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:15:34	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:15:35	SPEAKER_03
 More to your own personality or house style.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_00
 We didn't...

0:15:38	SPEAKER_00
 We're not planning to use fronts, I believe.

0:15:41	SPEAKER_00
 Not fronts, but they're not designed to fit their thing.

0:15:44	SPEAKER_02
 And that's still...

0:15:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, it's a little personal touch, I guess.

0:15:49	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe we should do three or something in our...

0:15:52	SPEAKER_02
 What would you guys think?

0:15:54	SPEAKER_02
 Personally.

0:15:55	SPEAKER_01
 Personally.

0:15:57	SPEAKER_01
 We can make it a one.

0:15:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, but what is it?

0:16:00	SPEAKER_03
 I think two or three...

0:16:04	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:16:05	SPEAKER_01
 I agree.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_01
 Two or three?

0:16:09	SPEAKER_01
 I go for the politics, so I go for two.

0:16:13	SPEAKER_02
 I was thinking about three, so I...

0:16:15	SPEAKER_00
 I was thinking about four, so I think three is...

0:16:17	SPEAKER_02
 Three is a bit...

0:16:20	SPEAKER_02
 What am I doing?

0:16:22	SPEAKER_02
 I'll mark it.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_02
 Remote controls and then makes stepping easy.

0:16:28	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:29	SPEAKER_00
 Let's make it a one.

0:16:31	SPEAKER_00
 One.

0:16:32	SPEAKER_01
 One, you agree?

0:16:33	SPEAKER_01
 Okay, I agree.

0:16:34	SPEAKER_01
 That's one thing for sure.

0:16:36	SPEAKER_01
 I'm not having usability, so...

0:16:37	SPEAKER_02
 I totally agree.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_02
 Remote controls, the remote controls, relevant buttons, are prominently visible.

0:16:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:16:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:45	SPEAKER_00
 Two are aware, I guess.

0:16:46	SPEAKER_00
 It's something we really work into.

0:16:49	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:51	SPEAKER_00
 It's all about buttons.

0:16:52	SPEAKER_02
 Every button is relevant.

0:16:56	SPEAKER_02
 And they're all...

0:16:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:58	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:16:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:17:01	SPEAKER_02
 That's one.

0:17:02	SPEAKER_04
 You agree?

0:17:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_02
 Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons, I think.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_02
 We totally succeeded there.

0:17:09	SPEAKER_00
 Well, maybe two because of the menu part or something.

0:17:12	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the buttons of the one, the two, the digits.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we don't know if the data...

0:17:31	SPEAKER_02
 That's true, that's true.

0:17:32	SPEAKER_02
 They're definitely needed.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_00
 It can also always be more simplistic.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_02
 You put it on a tool?

0:17:38	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control has got a really trendy look.

0:17:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_03
 One.

0:17:43	None
 Martin.

0:17:44	SPEAKER_00
 Well...

0:17:45	SPEAKER_00
 I think two.

0:17:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:17:47	SPEAKER_00
 It's hard to say from a speech.

0:17:49	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:17:50	SPEAKER_03
 We've tried to make it the best training look ever.

0:17:54	SPEAKER_03
 Ever.

0:17:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:17:56	None
 You know.

0:17:57	SPEAKER_00
 But I do think it's more...

0:17:58	SPEAKER_01
 I don't make it a tree because...

0:18:00	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_00
 I think that it's more trendy than beautiful.

0:18:04	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I agree.

0:18:05	SPEAKER_00
 So I think maybe it has to score higher on this than on the...

0:18:08	SPEAKER_02
 I was planning to give it a two where I give the not ugly...

0:18:11	SPEAKER_02
 The three.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, yeah.

0:18:13	SPEAKER_02
 That's true.

0:18:14	SPEAKER_02
 You agree or not too?

0:18:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, when you compare it to the...

0:18:18	SPEAKER_02
 Great.

0:18:19	SPEAKER_02
 Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons.

0:18:24	SPEAKER_00
 What's the difference with...

0:18:25	SPEAKER_00
 I copied that one.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_02
 Well, forget that.

0:18:28	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:18:29	SPEAKER_02
 Um...

0:18:31	SPEAKER_02
 No way.

0:18:33	SPEAKER_02
 Remote control has got innovative technology implanted.

0:18:37	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:18:38	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:18:39	SPEAKER_01
 We're not.

0:18:40	SPEAKER_01
 Well, maybe the LCD.

0:18:41	SPEAKER_01
 LCD.

0:18:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but we...

0:18:43	SPEAKER_00
 You mean the rubber stuff?

0:18:45	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, and the lights.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but you have to...

0:18:47	SPEAKER_00
 That's not innovative.

0:18:48	SPEAKER_00
 That's not innovative.

0:18:49	SPEAKER_00
 And I don't know if it's also really not innovative.

0:18:51	SPEAKER_00
 Light's up.

0:18:52	SPEAKER_02
 It's not...

0:18:53	SPEAKER_00
 Seven?

0:18:54	SPEAKER_00
 No, six.

0:18:55	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, seven maybe.

0:18:56	SPEAKER_00
 No, six.

0:18:57	SPEAKER_02
 Why not seven?

0:18:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, why not seven?

0:19:00	SPEAKER_03
 Because we've tried to make it a little bit innovative.

0:19:03	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_00
 But how?

0:19:05	SPEAKER_00
 It depends on the...

0:19:06	SPEAKER_03
 With the lights, it's kind of future.

0:19:09	SPEAKER_00
 No, I think...

0:19:10	SPEAKER_00
 I think actually it's seven maybe, but there's nothing innovative about it.

0:19:13	SPEAKER_02
 It's true.

0:19:14	SPEAKER_02
 I agree.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_03
 But still, you can retrieve it when it's gone.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_03
 Innovate it in general.

0:19:20	None
 Yeah, you didn't draw a But you said...

0:19:22	SPEAKER_02
 No, no.

0:19:23	SPEAKER_02
 The docking station is...

0:19:25	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, the docking station, but I think...

0:19:28	SPEAKER_00
 It's a part of the remote docking station.

0:19:30	SPEAKER_00
 It's going to be a kind of a problem.

0:19:32	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:19:33	SPEAKER_00
 And when the speaker...

0:19:34	SPEAKER_00
 Well, let's leave it open for us later to see.

0:19:37	SPEAKER_00
 But because we have to reevaluate anyway.

0:19:39	SPEAKER_00
 Well, yeah.

0:19:40	SPEAKER_02
 Well, the agenda says evaluate now, so I think...

0:19:44	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, for now it's a six or a seven, maybe...

0:19:47	SPEAKER_00
 But retrieval or...

0:19:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but I don't know if it's very...

0:19:51	SPEAKER_02
 I think that's very innovative for our control.

0:19:54	SPEAKER_03
 How would you innovate a remote control more?

0:19:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, more through like TV functionality.

0:20:01	SPEAKER_00
 To put it on your head.

0:20:02	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no, no.

0:20:03	SPEAKER_00
 You know it when I...

0:20:04	SPEAKER_00
 You must be innovative technology for remote controls, but more...

0:20:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, sir.

0:20:09	SPEAKER_00
 In how you control stuff, not in how you find your...

0:20:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_00
 I definitely don't think it's a five.

0:20:14	SPEAKER_00
 Let's think about it later.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control is easy to use.

0:20:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, as a one or two, at least.

0:20:21	SPEAKER_02
 I think a two.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_00
 I think a two.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_02
 More on.

0:20:26	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control hasn't got...

0:20:28	SPEAKER_00
 No, I want to see that one before.

0:20:31	SPEAKER_00
 I just get one...

0:20:32	SPEAKER_02
 I've just filled...

0:20:33	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:34	SPEAKER_02
 That way.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_03
 You like the buttons?

0:20:37	SPEAKER_02
 I found 12 questions so much, but it's still a stop.

0:20:40	SPEAKER_00
 No control will be bought by...

0:20:42	SPEAKER_02
 It will be bought by people under the age of 14.

0:20:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, definitely.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_03
 In comparing with people of...

0:20:50	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no, no.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_02
 Just in general.

0:20:53	SPEAKER_02
 If they buy it.

0:20:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, two.

0:20:55	SPEAKER_03
 We don't know.

0:20:56	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, what do you think?

0:20:57	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:20:58	SPEAKER_01
 I think two.

0:20:59	SPEAKER_03
 I agree.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_03
 Contact two.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, two, but only when you compare it with elderly.

0:21:04	SPEAKER_00
 There's no question.

0:21:05	SPEAKER_00
 It's just...

0:21:06	SPEAKER_00
 It will be bought by people under 40.

0:21:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, it can be very...

0:21:11	SPEAKER_00
 And I don't mean to be...

0:21:12	SPEAKER_00
 Just guessing.

0:21:13	SPEAKER_00
 I'll just make it a two.

0:21:15	SPEAKER_03
 Make it a two.

0:21:16	SPEAKER_03
 When it succeeds, it can get a two...

0:21:19	SPEAKER_03
 Right.

0:21:21	SPEAKER_02
 The remote control has recognizable corporate image color, logo or slogan.

0:21:27	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, thank you.

0:21:28	SPEAKER_00
 Slogan is quite obvious.

0:21:30	SPEAKER_00
 No, the slogan.

0:21:32	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, sorry.

0:21:33	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, the slogan.

0:21:34	SPEAKER_00
 You can put that on the side if we would like to.

0:21:37	SPEAKER_03
 I'm a mess.

0:21:38	SPEAKER_03
 Encrypt it with...

0:21:40	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, and I will...

0:21:41	SPEAKER_00
 I'm gonna do that.

0:21:42	SPEAKER_00
 I still think it's gonna be a two or three, maybe three this time.

0:21:46	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, three.

0:21:47	SPEAKER_02
 I agree.

0:21:48	SPEAKER_02
 Because of the slogan in the...

0:21:51	SPEAKER_02
 Remote control has got a basic design intended for no...

0:21:54	SPEAKER_02
 So one or two?

0:21:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, two.

0:21:56	SPEAKER_02
 Yes.

0:21:57	SPEAKER_02
 Two?

0:21:58	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, make it a two.

0:21:59	SPEAKER_02
 Two.

0:22:00	None
 All right.

0:22:01	SPEAKER_02
 We've got to add up the scores now to see our total average four, five, seven, nine.

0:22:09	SPEAKER_02
 Look at that.

0:22:10	SPEAKER_02
 Fifteen, seventeen, twenty-one, twenty-four, twenty-six.

0:22:16	SPEAKER_02
 Twenty-six.

0:22:17	SPEAKER_02
 It's a two point six.

0:22:22	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:22:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's mostly the...

0:22:28	SPEAKER_00
 When we score higher on innovative technology, we would score it too.

0:22:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:22:34	SPEAKER_00
 Which is quite a great score.

0:22:36	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:22:37	SPEAKER_00
 This was the evaluation.

0:22:39	SPEAKER_02
 This was my evaluation.

0:22:40	SPEAKER_00
 Because I still think that the most important part of this meeting is...

0:22:43	SPEAKER_02
 The pretty nice job until now.

0:22:47	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:22:48	SPEAKER_02
 Is this your...

0:22:50	SPEAKER_02
 Is there something after this meeting?

0:22:53	SPEAKER_02
 Well, I think we've got to fill out another question now.

0:22:56	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:22:57	None
 Okay.

0:22:58	SPEAKER_00
 So open door.

0:23:06	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:23:10	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. Finance.

0:23:13	SPEAKER_00
 Because I received a spreadsheet.

0:23:18	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but I actually don't need this presentation, I guess.

0:23:23	SPEAKER_02
 That's not a matter.

0:23:25	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to open the spreadsheet and we're going to work this out together because I didn't really finish it.

0:23:31	SPEAKER_00
 I...

0:23:32	SPEAKER_00
 Didn't really finish it.

0:23:37	SPEAKER_00
 But we will see we'll stumble upon some problems.

0:23:42	SPEAKER_00
 Probably won't look for any...

0:23:44	SPEAKER_00
 Probably have already opened it here.

0:23:51	SPEAKER_00
 I'll try it again.

0:23:54	SPEAKER_00
 First of all, the...

0:23:56	SPEAKER_00
 All the docking station and...

0:23:58	SPEAKER_00
 Costs and such are not included in this list.

0:24:04	SPEAKER_00
 But let's start with the meeting.

0:24:06	SPEAKER_00
 Let's conclude one battery.

0:24:08	SPEAKER_00
 I'll explain it.

0:24:09	SPEAKER_00
 The components are listed over here.

0:24:12	SPEAKER_00
 Price is given.

0:24:14	SPEAKER_00
 We indicate the amount of components, specific component, how much we need over them.

0:24:21	SPEAKER_00
 And then...

0:24:22	SPEAKER_00
 Don't watch the number yet.

0:24:24	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know if it's filled in properly.

0:24:27	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. We need one battery and one battery.

0:24:29	SPEAKER_00
 I think we're going to use enough.

0:24:31	SPEAKER_00
 We don't need kinetic, solar, solar, hand-dun, ammo.

0:24:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. This is the first problem.

0:24:36	SPEAKER_00
 I think we should know how many simple chips, regular chips.

0:24:43	SPEAKER_03
 It's one chip, but you have to choose one format.

0:24:47	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:24:48	SPEAKER_03
 But simple chip is enough, I think.

0:24:52	SPEAKER_03
 With the lights and the retrieval, can we find this information?

0:24:56	SPEAKER_02
 I haven't got an idea in which we need to use.

0:24:59	SPEAKER_00
 I think it was your job in the first meeting, for your first presentation to make this clear.

0:25:07	SPEAKER_00
 But then you had some time problems.

0:25:09	SPEAKER_00
 Do you know what chip we need?

0:25:12	SPEAKER_03
 The email I got said, simple chip.

0:25:16	SPEAKER_03
 But when we put in the speaker and the retrieval device, it will cost a bit more like, I think, the advanced chip.

0:25:28	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe.

0:25:29	SPEAKER_02
 And how do you know?

0:25:31	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, you got that email.

0:25:33	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe you can look it up right now.

0:25:35	SPEAKER_03
 They didn't know about a retriever or a speaker.

0:25:38	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. When we leave the retriever in such a site, then it's a simple chip.

0:25:44	SPEAKER_00
 Then it would be a simple chip.

0:25:45	SPEAKER_00
 And with the retriever, it would be an advanced chip.

0:25:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:25:49	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:25:50	SPEAKER_02
 I point out the advanced chip for now, I guess.

0:25:52	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:25:53	SPEAKER_03
 That would be enough for future recommendations.

0:25:55	SPEAKER_00
 It would be because of a lot of problems.

0:25:58	SPEAKER_00
 The sample sensor, sample speaker.

0:26:01	SPEAKER_00
 Is that the speaker we were to?

0:26:03	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know what it is.

0:26:04	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:26:05	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:26:07	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. We went for the double-curved case.

0:26:13	SPEAKER_00
 Made out of plastic and rubber.

0:26:18	SPEAKER_00
 And with a special collar.

0:26:21	SPEAKER_00
 I guess that's what we were.

0:26:23	SPEAKER_01
 Well, special collar.

0:26:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I don't know about the special collar.

0:26:26	SPEAKER_03
 Otherwise you can't think of standard plastic collar.

0:26:29	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think we have a special collar.

0:26:30	SPEAKER_02
 We have a standard rubber.

0:26:31	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:26:32	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. Then the push button.

0:26:33	SPEAKER_00
 I was just counting them.

0:26:35	SPEAKER_00
 I think you have to indicate the amount of push buttons we want to use, isn't it?

0:26:40	SPEAKER_00
 Oh.

0:26:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:26:42	SPEAKER_00
 Well, that's a bit of a problem because...

0:26:44	SPEAKER_00
 But I really don't understand that because I can imagine a remote control with far more push buttons, and it wouldn't be possible according to this sheet.

0:26:54	SPEAKER_01
 The same post buttons.

0:26:56	SPEAKER_03
 No, it's only when you use push buttons, it will cost that much.

0:27:01	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think so because it's a scroll wheel.

0:27:03	SPEAKER_02
 If you use a scroll wheel, the yellow row is the amount of...

0:27:06	SPEAKER_00
 So in the number of components you plan to use in the files and it tells the cost, I don't know.

0:27:10	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe it's the kind of push buttons.

0:27:12	SPEAKER_03
 You can have four kind of push buttons.

0:27:14	SPEAKER_01
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, and thirteen.

0:27:21	SPEAKER_00
 This is one.

0:27:22	SPEAKER_00
 Okay. 12. Okay. Then it will be 18.

0:27:31	SPEAKER_00
 Because I rated them as...

0:27:34	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, for four months.

0:27:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yes.

0:27:39	SPEAKER_00
 I think that... Plus the mute button, and it will be 18.

0:27:44	SPEAKER_00
 18.

0:27:45	SPEAKER_02
 One, two, three, four, five.

0:27:47	SPEAKER_03
 Why is that so expensive?

0:27:50	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I don't understand.

0:27:51	SPEAKER_00
 I don't get the point because it would be relatively so expensive, just small buttons.

0:27:59	SPEAKER_01
 Is it sense? The 50 cents? 50 cents for one single stupid button.

0:28:04	SPEAKER_02
 So where are you...

0:28:06	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, let's make it just one.

0:28:08	SPEAKER_03
 It's 80% of the price of the...

0:28:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, now it's already...

0:28:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, exactly.

0:28:13	SPEAKER_00
 Shall we just give our own interpretation to it?

0:28:18	SPEAKER_00
 Because else we would really have a problem.

0:28:20	SPEAKER_00
 It would be impossible to make it...

0:28:22	SPEAKER_02
 I couldn't understand it if it was 50 cents per button.

0:28:26	SPEAKER_03
 When you have the same amount of button, you have to put it in a carton.

0:28:30	SPEAKER_03
 And less buttons than this.

0:28:32	SPEAKER_00
 Isn't possible.

0:28:33	SPEAKER_00
 This is the most simple... Yeah, it is possible, but I've never seen one before.

0:28:37	SPEAKER_03
 I've seen one remote control.

0:28:39	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, without the numbers.

0:28:41	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, only with the page up, page down.

0:28:44	SPEAKER_03
 And all of you...

0:28:45	SPEAKER_00
 Keep the numbers.

0:28:46	SPEAKER_02
 But I wouldn't want to own that.

0:28:48	SPEAKER_02
 That's still four.

0:28:49	SPEAKER_02
 It's still for little children.

0:28:50	SPEAKER_03
 They can handle that remote control.

0:28:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, then the text would also be impossible.

0:28:55	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, it's just for a little option.

0:28:58	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, well, just...

0:28:59	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but then still, when we...

0:29:01	SPEAKER_00
 There is no room for a docking station or something.

0:29:04	SPEAKER_00
 Let's see.

0:29:05	SPEAKER_00
 We have a button supplement.

0:29:07	SPEAKER_00
 We'll give the buttons a special color.

0:29:09	SPEAKER_00
 We'll give them a special form.

0:29:10	SPEAKER_00
 I think we should mark the special form thing because this will be some special form.

0:29:15	SPEAKER_00
 So, incorporated in these big buttons, I guess.

0:29:18	SPEAKER_01
 Special color, why is special color?

0:29:20	SPEAKER_00
 Because the buttons will be matching color between the buttons and the rubber surroundings.

0:29:25	SPEAKER_00
 I think that's what they mean by a special color.

0:29:28	SPEAKER_00
 I think all the special color things have to be marked over here because that's what we were planning to do, making it...

0:29:34	SPEAKER_03
 Special form also.

0:29:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, special material also because there's rubber and the buttons have to be rubber.

0:29:42	SPEAKER_03
 What is the normal material?

0:29:44	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I don't know.

0:29:46	SPEAKER_02
 Classic, I think.

0:29:48	SPEAKER_01
 Classic.

0:29:49	SPEAKER_03
 Classic.

0:29:50	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but the problem now is that...

0:29:55	SPEAKER_00
 There's no such thing as a docking station in this list, but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for 30 cents.

0:30:03	SPEAKER_03
 But we can sell the remote control and sell the docking station separately.

0:30:11	SPEAKER_03
 Yes, and we don't have to tell it, but we can say we can almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without a docking station.

0:30:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I do like the idea, but the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore.

0:30:31	SPEAKER_00
 No, but then we have to find out what chip we need.

0:30:37	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I really don't get it. I mean, if it's a simple chip, I think we can all be honest.

0:30:42	SPEAKER_00
 I think the special color thing has to be marked because I think that's what they...

0:30:50	SPEAKER_03
 But for two euros and 30 cents, we don't get a docking station.

0:30:54	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know. Can we find out about the chips? Because when we don't need a docking station, then probably we also need a simple chip.

0:31:04	SPEAKER_01
 And then we can get...

0:31:06	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe then we can do something extra.

0:31:09	SPEAKER_00
 But it's still always going to get more expensive with the Simona.

0:31:13	SPEAKER_00
 Then we have some money left. We can put...

0:31:15	SPEAKER_00
 Then for two euros, we can put a scroll wheel on it.

0:31:19	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we know.

0:31:21	SPEAKER_02
 Ah, why?

0:31:22	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, if it would cost two euros, the kind of total thing, it would be nice, too.

0:31:28	SPEAKER_02
 I mean, we're not going to add...

0:31:30	SPEAKER_02
 But what can we do?

0:31:31	SPEAKER_00
 How are we going to do the kinetic cells? That's also maybe an idea.

0:31:34	SPEAKER_01
 But what can we do with the simple chip? What's the difference with the regular chip?

0:31:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's what we can find out. Maybe we can find it in your email right now.

0:31:42	SPEAKER_00
 And we know exactly what it will cost us. Maybe it's nice to know.

0:31:49	SPEAKER_01
 Regular chip. Because we don't have special functions to use.

0:31:53	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but when we...

0:31:55	SPEAKER_02
 We have a farm chip, for example, I'm like the hand in ammo.

0:31:57	SPEAKER_00
 But when we skip...

0:31:59	SPEAKER_00
 When we don't use the...

0:32:01	SPEAKER_00
 I'm going to make the docking station.

0:32:03	SPEAKER_00
 Then we still...

0:32:05	SPEAKER_00
 We need something else maybe to make it kind of special, because that was our special future.

0:32:11	SPEAKER_02
 We can make a plane docking station for two euros.

0:32:13	SPEAKER_02
 We'll go back tomorrow.

0:32:14	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, okay. You can also do the...

0:32:16	SPEAKER_00
 Without the recharge...

0:32:17	SPEAKER_00
 It still is a special remote control, you know.

0:32:20	SPEAKER_00
 It's for a special one.

0:32:22	SPEAKER_02
 But we can make a docking station for two euros if you don't put the recharge function in it.

0:32:28	SPEAKER_02
 I mean...

0:32:30	SPEAKER_02
 It has a shape.

0:32:31	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but for two euros.

0:32:33	SPEAKER_00
 And we have to use the advanced chip.

0:32:36	SPEAKER_00
 And two euros. Is it even possible?

0:32:40	SPEAKER_02
 Why should that not be possible?

0:32:42	SPEAKER_00
 Because then we...

0:32:44	SPEAKER_00
 Three cents left.

0:32:46	SPEAKER_02
 Now, for the docking station, if you choose the simple chip.

0:32:51	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but...

0:32:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I don't know, because maybe...

0:32:54	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we'll find out what the same thing is.

0:32:56	SPEAKER_01
 That's the question.

0:32:57	SPEAKER_01
 If we do need an advanced chip.

0:32:59	SPEAKER_01
 Yes, and we...

0:33:01	SPEAKER_00
 And we listen to my world's vision.

0:33:02	SPEAKER_00
 Sample, sample, sample, sample, sample, sample.

0:33:04	SPEAKER_03
 I don't know either.

0:33:05	SPEAKER_03
 It isn't in my information.

0:33:06	SPEAKER_03
 I've got a...

0:33:10	SPEAKER_03
 A schematic view of the remote control, but nothing about advanced chips or...

0:33:15	SPEAKER_00
 Let's take a look at it for presentation.

0:33:21	SPEAKER_00
 Technical functions?

0:33:26	SPEAKER_01
 No.

0:33:27	SPEAKER_01
 I've got here on my...

0:33:28	SPEAKER_01
 I will put a...

0:33:29	SPEAKER_03
 I will put a page on it.

0:33:33	SPEAKER_03
 When my mouse works again.

0:33:40	SPEAKER_04
 Oh, oh, oh.

0:33:46	SPEAKER_04
 Hey.

0:33:50	SPEAKER_03
 My mouse is...

0:33:51	SPEAKER_02
 Dead.

0:33:52	SPEAKER_03
 Yes.

0:33:53	SPEAKER_02
 Reanimated.

0:33:54	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, died.

0:33:57	SPEAKER_03
 Ah, I've got it.

0:33:59	SPEAKER_03
 I will put my email on the...

0:34:04	SPEAKER_03
 On the network.

0:34:09	None
 What the hell are these?

0:34:14	SPEAKER_02
 It's on it.

0:34:19	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, what a...

0:34:24	None
 Yeah, it's open.

0:34:29	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think it's in here already.

0:34:44	SPEAKER_01
 There's only just...

0:35:05	SPEAKER_01
 There's nothing about...

0:35:16	SPEAKER_00
 In the presentation of yours, there was also something about different components.

0:35:20	SPEAKER_00
 Which one was it?

0:35:21	SPEAKER_00
 Component.

0:35:22	SPEAKER_00
 Fictional requirements?

0:35:25	SPEAKER_02
 No, that was my personal...

0:35:26	SPEAKER_01
 Component design, maybe.

0:35:28	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, that was mine.

0:35:31	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, that was the second.

0:35:33	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, that was my second.

0:35:36	SPEAKER_00
 Your first presentation.

0:35:37	SPEAKER_02
 It's at the bottom.

0:35:38	SPEAKER_02
 It's a taskbar.

0:35:42	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's the other one.

0:35:45	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:35:46	SPEAKER_01
 This is not the right one.

0:35:50	SPEAKER_00
 I don't...

0:35:51	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, sorry.

0:35:56	SPEAKER_00
 This is the other one.

0:35:58	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe something about...

0:36:01	SPEAKER_00
 In these chips.

0:36:05	SPEAKER_03
 This is the same...

0:36:08	SPEAKER_03
 This is only the possibilities.

0:36:11	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:36:14	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, we can use a simple regular or advanced chip.

0:36:19	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, nice.

0:36:21	SPEAKER_02
 That's the same.

0:36:22	SPEAKER_00
 You know that a push button requires a simple chip, but a scroll wheel requires...

0:36:26	SPEAKER_00
 Oh, okay.

0:36:27	SPEAKER_00
...a ring tube is not open.

0:36:29	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, so we only need a simple chip.

0:36:32	SPEAKER_03
 With a light.

0:36:34	SPEAKER_01
 A little light.

0:36:35	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, but that's just the same as the...

0:36:38	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, this is a simple chip.

0:36:41	SPEAKER_02
 That's that neat.

0:36:42	SPEAKER_00
 The scroll wheel...

0:36:43	SPEAKER_00
 This only states that the scroll wheel requires a regular chip, and that a display requires an advanced chip.

0:36:48	SPEAKER_00
 So we don't need anything.

0:36:49	SPEAKER_02
 This display is, of course, for some...

0:36:51	SPEAKER_02
 For some text.

0:36:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:36:53	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think that...

0:36:55	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:36:56	SPEAKER_02
 Just a little light.

0:36:59	SPEAKER_01
 I think a normal simple chip will be okay.

0:37:02	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, I agree.

0:37:03	SPEAKER_00
 And what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker?

0:37:09	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe you can say against the remote page.

0:37:13	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:14	SPEAKER_03
 Page up, page run.

0:37:15	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I guess so too.

0:37:17	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:37:18	SPEAKER_01
 That's not what we want.

0:37:21	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:37:22	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we might want it, but...

0:37:25	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:37:26	SPEAKER_03
 All in 12 euros.

0:37:27	SPEAKER_00
 In the back two costs.

0:37:28	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:37:29	SPEAKER_03
 12 euros and 50 cents.

0:37:31	SPEAKER_00
 So we're going to use a simple chip.

0:37:33	SPEAKER_03
 Great.

0:37:34	SPEAKER_02
 Delete.

0:37:35	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:37:36	SPEAKER_03
 In the light.

0:37:37	SPEAKER_03
 Where are the lights?

0:37:38	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, the lights.

0:37:39	SPEAKER_01
 There's no...

0:37:40	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, they're free, I guess.

0:37:42	SPEAKER_02
 Category.

0:37:43	SPEAKER_00
 No, there is someone left to be spent.

0:37:48	SPEAKER_00
 Can we do it?

0:37:49	SPEAKER_01
 I think we can make a darker station.

0:37:51	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but what we have to think about now is that...

0:37:54	SPEAKER_00
 Is this still a special remote control?

0:37:58	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, it hasn't got any innovative technology.

0:38:02	SPEAKER_00
 We aren't going to apply any innovative technology anyway, I think.

0:38:08	SPEAKER_00
 I don't see any possibility to do so because it wouldn't fit our design philosophy.

0:38:15	SPEAKER_00
 Is there some extra...

0:38:17	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe, I think, maybe the kinetic thing is something instead of the rechargeable.

0:38:23	SPEAKER_00
 The rechargeable thing was something to...

0:38:27	SPEAKER_00
 So people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore.

0:38:31	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe if we put the kinetic thing in it.

0:38:33	SPEAKER_00
 But sometimes you put it...

0:38:35	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you leave...

0:38:36	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I know, but still, they will think about that.

0:38:39	SPEAKER_00
 I mean, if you...

0:38:40	SPEAKER_03
 Kinetics are nowadays only used in watches.

0:38:43	SPEAKER_00
 It's made for people, but they don't...

0:38:46	SPEAKER_00
 If it was useless technology, they wouldn't put it as a possibility.

0:38:50	SPEAKER_00
 A solar sensor used for the hand of the knife.

0:38:52	SPEAKER_00
 The target group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control.

0:39:01	SPEAKER_00
 Because I think when there was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic power source, then it would be this one because it's one that gets thrown around a lot and gets used a lot.

0:39:19	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe that's a cool thing about it, you know?

0:39:23	SPEAKER_00
 You don't use batteries.

0:39:24	SPEAKER_00
 I've never seen it before in a remote control.

0:39:27	SPEAKER_01
 Then we can make a docking station five minutes.

0:39:33	SPEAKER_00
 No, we can make a docking station anyway.

0:39:36	SPEAKER_02
 That's not true.

0:39:37	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we can also...

0:39:38	SPEAKER_00
 We can make a docking station.

0:39:40	SPEAKER_00
 We can still make...

0:39:41	SPEAKER_01
 Look at now, we got two...

0:39:43	SPEAKER_01
 Two-thirty left.

0:39:45	SPEAKER_01
 We can make a docking station.

0:39:47	SPEAKER_03
 A docking station like that?

0:39:49	SPEAKER_03
 With a cable, with buttons on it, with retrieval, a device in it.

0:39:53	SPEAKER_02
 The power device is very cheap.

0:39:56	SPEAKER_02
 That's just a regular power cable.

0:39:58	SPEAKER_00
 It would be serious.

0:39:59	SPEAKER_00
 The docking station would be...

0:40:01	SPEAKER_00
 With a button.

0:40:02	SPEAKER_03
 With a button to retrieve it, so it will beep.

0:40:07	SPEAKER_03
 So it's wireless technology.

0:40:10	SPEAKER_00
 We haven't looked at the discosts of the speaker and other stuff.

0:40:16	SPEAKER_00
 I don't think it's realistically to do so.

0:40:19	SPEAKER_02
 Well, then it's useless project.

0:40:21	None
 Look at the case.

0:40:22	SPEAKER_03
 The case of...

0:40:24	SPEAKER_01
 Then we don't have...

0:40:26	SPEAKER_00
 Look at all these special stuff.

0:40:28	SPEAKER_00
 The colors are special, the form is special.

0:40:32	SPEAKER_00
 This is a whole concept.

0:40:34	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe with the kinetic thing.

0:40:36	SPEAKER_00
 I think we could do a compromise with the kinetic thing.

0:40:39	SPEAKER_02
 Can we say 15 euros?

0:40:40	SPEAKER_02
 No, it's the...

0:40:42	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:40:43	SPEAKER_03
 Then we have to sell it for 30 euros.

0:40:46	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:40:47	SPEAKER_02
 We only make less profit over it.

0:40:50	SPEAKER_02
 You can sell for 27.5.

0:40:53	SPEAKER_02
 Then you make as much profit as you would with 12.5 production costs.

0:40:58	SPEAKER_00
 My suggestion is just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it like...

0:41:05	SPEAKER_00
 I also feel this concept of making it kinetic.

0:41:11	SPEAKER_00
 Because of the...

0:41:13	SPEAKER_03
 I don't think we can do it with both.

0:41:15	SPEAKER_03
 Maybe we can do it both in the remote.

0:41:18	SPEAKER_03
 Battery and kinetic.

0:41:20	SPEAKER_03
 No.

0:41:21	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:41:22	SPEAKER_00
 That wouldn't...

0:41:23	SPEAKER_02
 No.

0:41:24	None
 Thirteen, twenty.

0:41:25	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and it's also not a good...

0:41:29	SPEAKER_00
 It's not a good...

0:41:30	SPEAKER_00
 It's really only kinetic.

0:41:31	SPEAKER_00
 You don't want to think about batteries anymore.

0:41:32	SPEAKER_00
 Yes, but when it's kinetic...

0:41:34	SPEAKER_03
 No, you have to shake it.

0:41:36	SPEAKER_03
 And when it's empty.

0:41:38	SPEAKER_00
 It's great.

0:41:39	SPEAKER_02
 You have to throw it through the room like 20 times an hour.

0:41:42	SPEAKER_00
 No, no, no.

0:41:43	SPEAKER_00
 This is very sophisticated technology.

0:41:45	SPEAKER_00
 When you use it for...

0:41:47	SPEAKER_00
 You're remote like once today or maybe even less.

0:41:49	SPEAKER_03
 No, that's not true.

0:41:51	SPEAKER_03
 A watch is kinetic.

0:41:53	SPEAKER_03
 Because you walk all the time.

0:41:54	SPEAKER_00
 We can make it...

0:41:55	SPEAKER_00
 No.

0:41:56	SPEAKER_00
 Be able to remote control gets...

0:41:58	SPEAKER_00
 Why do they state that this technology can be used to be...

0:42:00	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, solar cells are also stated.

0:42:02	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but a calculator also works on solar cells.

0:42:07	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, you solar cells.

0:42:09	SPEAKER_00
 Because I think the whole dynamic part, you know, appeals to me thinking of our design philosophy, you know, with the rubber parts and sturdiness of the thing.

0:42:20	SPEAKER_00
 And when you move it around a lot, then people find the idea funny than when I move my remote control around.

0:42:26	SPEAKER_02
 That's true.

0:42:27	SPEAKER_02
 It's funny for a week.

0:42:28	SPEAKER_02
 I guess something like that where you have to move it around very frequently.

0:42:32	SPEAKER_02
 It's the most...

0:42:33	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, you don't have to.

0:42:35	SPEAKER_00
 Trust me, the idea of this technology is that you don't think about it.

0:42:38	SPEAKER_00
 It just happens.

0:42:39	SPEAKER_02
 No, I don't move.

0:42:41	SPEAKER_02
 My remote control...

0:42:43	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, we don't have to do it, but we just have a lack of key futures.

0:42:47	SPEAKER_00
 You know, you have to put something on your box to make people buy it.

0:42:51	SPEAKER_00
 And we can really do the docking thing.

0:42:56	SPEAKER_00
 It's not...

0:42:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we can do it, but it would be an easy way out.

0:42:59	SPEAKER_03
 You can do it for 50 cents.

0:43:00	SPEAKER_02
 We've got more than 50 cents.

0:43:04	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but we have to do...

0:43:06	SPEAKER_00
 The case alone is...

0:43:07	SPEAKER_03
 Because we only have a minute left or so.

0:43:09	SPEAKER_03
 The case alone for a remote control is at least one euro.

0:43:13	SPEAKER_03
 Then we have one euro 30 for the whole documentation.

0:43:17	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, we can leave it on bed.

0:43:20	SPEAKER_00
 And then our concept is ready.

0:43:23	SPEAKER_01
 Keep remote control.

0:43:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, we...

0:43:30	SPEAKER_00
 Make some extra profit on it.

0:43:35	SPEAKER_02
 No, we won't.

0:43:38	SPEAKER_02
 Any ideas?

0:43:39	SPEAKER_02
 Of course not.

0:43:43	SPEAKER_03
 It's great.

0:43:46	SPEAKER_01
 We just have to go all what we did today again.

0:43:51	SPEAKER_01
 We have to do it over.

0:43:53	SPEAKER_02
 We'll come back tomorrow.

0:43:55	SPEAKER_00
 There's still some concept and some special left.

0:44:00	SPEAKER_00
 It's going to excel in the field of design and the looks and feel.

0:44:08	SPEAKER_00
 That's what makes it special.

0:44:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, and I would have liked the kinetic part as well to give it some extra special future.

0:44:20	SPEAKER_00
 I know it will work.

0:44:23	SPEAKER_00
 They're not putting technologies on this list if it was impossible to make it happen.

0:44:29	SPEAKER_03
 Why not a hand dynamic then?

0:44:34	SPEAKER_00
 Okay, but we leave like this.

0:44:36	SPEAKER_00
 Then it's nowhere.

0:44:38	SPEAKER_02
 We can do anything else.

0:44:39	SPEAKER_02
 Warning.

0:44:40	SPEAKER_02
 Finish meeting now.

0:44:42	SPEAKER_03
 We're done.

0:44:47	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:44:48	SPEAKER_00
 Is this it?

0:44:49	SPEAKER_00
 Sure.

0:44:54	SPEAKER_00
 We're going to do the last cheat.

0:44:59	SPEAKER_01
 We have to do this.

0:45:03	SPEAKER_02
 Yes, yes.

0:45:04	SPEAKER_02
 Celebration.

0:45:05	SPEAKER_02
 I don't see why, but where's the champagne?

0:45:08	SPEAKER_02
 I think we've got to fill out another question to be honest.

0:45:11	SPEAKER_03
 I don't hear a bell.

0:45:14	SPEAKER_02
 No, not yet.

0:45:18	SPEAKER_04
 All right.

0:45:19	SPEAKER_02
 We can do it here.

0:45:20	SPEAKER_02
 I'll see you guys in a minute.

0:45:21	SPEAKER_02
 Bye.

0:45:22	SPEAKER_02
 I don't think so.

0:45:23	SPEAKER_01
 Can we do it here?
