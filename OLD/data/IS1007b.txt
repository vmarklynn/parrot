0:00:30	SPEAKER_01
 So we are coming again for the second meeting.

0:00:41	SPEAKER_01
 So for the aim of this meeting, now it's to make presentation about the world for each one and you will take the decision, the design and the functionality of the world.

0:01:10	SPEAKER_01
 And we have, I think I got a new project requirement.

0:01:15	SPEAKER_01
 So I think the teletext becomes outdated.

0:01:22	SPEAKER_01
 So the popularity of the, since the popularity of the internet and I think we don't need writing adaptive.

0:01:31	SPEAKER_01
 So the remote control should be only used for the telefiction.

0:01:37	SPEAKER_01
 And of course we shouldn't have our immersion in the design.

0:01:45	SPEAKER_01
 So let's start with the, the industry designer.

0:01:54	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:01:55	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:01:56	SPEAKER_01
 So you can use the whiteboard.

0:01:59	SPEAKER_02
 When I have a PowerPoint presentation stored in my, in my personal folder.

0:02:06	SPEAKER_02
 So I think you can reach it from here.

0:02:10	SPEAKER_03
 Just go to Explorer or Open.

0:02:16	SPEAKER_03
 The participant.

0:02:17	SPEAKER_02
 The participant to this one.

0:02:24	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:02:25	SPEAKER_03
 Open.

0:02:26	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:02:27	None
 No.

0:02:28	None
 Open.

0:02:29	SPEAKER_00
 You can use up an email.

0:02:34	SPEAKER_00
 All right.

0:02:36	SPEAKER_02
 So I will talk about the working design.

0:02:40	SPEAKER_03
 Slideshow.

0:02:41	SPEAKER_03
 Will slideshow or this one.

0:02:43	SPEAKER_02
 And well, I will present my first idea on how to build the, our new remote control for television.

0:02:54	SPEAKER_02
 So can you go one page down please.

0:02:59	SPEAKER_02
 So I think the first thing to do is to define the hardware components needed to achieve what we want to do.

0:03:07	SPEAKER_02
 So I'm thinking, I think I'll do a survey about what is, what is available on the market and what is the cheapest possible thing we can use.

0:03:27	SPEAKER_02
 Then I will try with the technical team to, to build a prototype and to see how this little box would look like.

0:03:40	SPEAKER_02
 And how, and we can start troubleshooting first communication problems or things like that.

0:03:48	SPEAKER_02
 And when we are ready with this first prototype, I think we can have some software functionalities on a problemable chip like browsing by content or things like that.

0:03:59	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:04:00	SPEAKER_02
 So can you go down there?

0:04:03	SPEAKER_02
 So what I think for now is we, we don't want to have a remote control which is wide.

0:04:14	SPEAKER_02
 So I think we can use that tree for the implementation.

0:04:20	SPEAKER_02
 Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication.

0:04:26	SPEAKER_02
 And the communication with TV set is made through infrared communication.

0:04:34	SPEAKER_02
 So this is the schema of the story.

0:04:40	SPEAKER_02
 Of the future, I'm remote control.

0:04:43	SPEAKER_02
 So you can see the components, battery and the two chips goes to the infrared connection to the TV set.

0:04:53	SPEAKER_00
 What is the other chip for?

0:04:55	SPEAKER_00
 The one on top.

0:04:56	SPEAKER_02
 The one on top is for the, well, the functionality, the functionalities and the red, sorry, the green one is to, well, putting things together, transform the data into the format to protect the color, to communicate with the TV set.

0:05:17	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:05:18	SPEAKER_02
 And that's it.

0:05:20	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should use a FPGA for the functionalities which is easy to...

0:05:27	SPEAKER_02
 What is FPGA?

0:05:29	SPEAKER_02
 It's field programmable something.

0:05:32	SPEAKER_02
 Get various.

0:05:34	SPEAKER_03
 So how is it different from the Bluetooth?

0:05:39	SPEAKER_02
 Well, FPGA is just cheap.

0:05:42	SPEAKER_02
 You can program it with whatever you want.

0:05:47	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:05:48	SPEAKER_02
 And the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to make communication between the two devices.

0:05:55	SPEAKER_00
 So these are the, they have to work together or do they have to work together to separate choice?

0:06:01	SPEAKER_02
 The FPGA will produce the data to send.

0:06:04	SPEAKER_03
 Okay.

0:06:05	SPEAKER_03
 Or something like, is it hardware, the first one?

0:06:07	SPEAKER_03
 And the second one is for the software.

0:06:09	SPEAKER_00
 It's the software part.

0:06:10	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, to run.

0:06:11	SPEAKER_00
 To make it run.

0:06:12	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:13	SPEAKER_00
 So you can control it, you're not booking if you want, right?

0:06:16	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:17	SPEAKER_02
 All right.

0:06:18	SPEAKER_02
 And that's it for the working design.

0:06:20	SPEAKER_02
 So if you have any questions.

0:06:22	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:06:23	SPEAKER_03
 And how about the battery power?

0:06:25	SPEAKER_03
 You mean that battery will be somewhere there and the remote control, the power to the battery comes through in private?

0:06:30	SPEAKER_03
 No, no, no.

0:06:31	SPEAKER_02
 I think we have to have a embedded battery in the...

0:06:37	SPEAKER_02
 Into the...

0:06:38	SPEAKER_02
 Into the...

0:06:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, into the...

0:06:40	SPEAKER_02
 More compact.

0:06:41	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:06:42	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:06:43	SPEAKER_02
 And I don't think it will need very much power to make it run.

0:06:48	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:06:49	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:06:50	SPEAKER_00
 You can put it on a charger when you don't need to use it.

0:06:52	SPEAKER_02
 It's a good idea.

0:06:53	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:06:54	SPEAKER_03
 That's right.

0:06:55	SPEAKER_03
 Having a charger rather than putting a battery cell is always...

0:06:58	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah.

0:06:59	SPEAKER_03
 People don't like it to have...

0:07:01	SPEAKER_03
 To buy the batteries when they run out.

0:07:03	SPEAKER_03
 We just make a small charger and put it...

0:07:06	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:07	SPEAKER_00
 Because you're using...

0:07:08	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:09	SPEAKER_00
 Because I think if some people have PDA, they can use their PDA to control the TV if they want to.

0:07:14	SPEAKER_02
 Also, but...

0:07:15	SPEAKER_02
 But...

0:07:16	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know.

0:07:17	SPEAKER_02
 I think the goal is to sell our...

0:07:20	SPEAKER_02
 We don't want to make a PDA.

0:07:23	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:07:24	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:07:25	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:07:26	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:07:27	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:07:29	SPEAKER_02
 So, charger for the identity.

0:07:31	None
 Here's the key.

0:07:32	SPEAKER_01
 Um...

0:07:39	SPEAKER_00
 So, it's mine.

0:07:47	SPEAKER_00
 It's mine.

0:07:48	SPEAKER_01
 Oh.

0:07:49	SPEAKER_01
 Partition point one.

0:07:51	SPEAKER_00
 No?

0:07:52	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:07:53	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:07:58	SPEAKER_01
 Oh, we have 14.

0:08:00	SPEAKER_01
 So, let's move to...

0:08:03	SPEAKER_01
 To use the entire first design.

0:08:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:08:06	SPEAKER_00
 So, you can open...

0:08:08	SPEAKER_01
 Dr. Sipa...

0:08:09	SPEAKER_01
 Three.

0:08:15	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:08:16	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:08:19	SPEAKER_00
 So, I'm working on the technical functions design.

0:08:23	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:08:24	SPEAKER_00
 Let's show the next line.

0:08:26	SPEAKER_00
 So, the purpose is to find the important questions to ask is what effects should the apparatus have.

0:08:35	SPEAKER_00
 So...

0:08:37	SPEAKER_00
 So, I found on the website...

0:08:39	SPEAKER_00
 On the internet.

0:08:40	SPEAKER_00
 Doing everything.

0:08:42	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:08:43	SPEAKER_00
 I spent a lot of time searching.

0:08:45	SPEAKER_00
 That's right.

0:08:46	SPEAKER_00
 And I found that the function of remote control is the same messages the television set.

0:08:54	SPEAKER_00
 For example, switch on, switch off, switch the next channel and so on and so on.

0:09:01	SPEAKER_00
 So, I found two very good prototypes for this interface from our competitors.

0:09:08	SPEAKER_00
 So, can you...

0:09:09	SPEAKER_01
 This are usual functionality.

0:09:11	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:12	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:13	SPEAKER_00
 So, ours is a bit different.

0:09:16	SPEAKER_00
 So, these are two examples.

0:09:18	SPEAKER_00
 One is from...

0:09:19	SPEAKER_00
 OpaG, the other one is from...

0:09:22	SPEAKER_00
 Tasks.

0:09:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:24	SPEAKER_00
 Engineering Central.

0:09:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:27	SPEAKER_00
 This is the most competing prototypes I found.

0:09:30	SPEAKER_00
 But then, look.

0:09:32	SPEAKER_00
 But then I found, if you look at...

0:09:34	SPEAKER_00
 You see on the left one, there are too many buttons.

0:09:36	SPEAKER_01
 And they are small.

0:09:38	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:39	SPEAKER_00
 On the right, I tried to play with.

0:09:41	SPEAKER_00
 The problem is that if I have 100 channels, I have to press the other button to choose the 100 channels.

0:09:49	SPEAKER_00
 And I have to compose the number, so it's very lousy.

0:09:54	SPEAKER_00
 So, you move to the next...

0:09:56	SPEAKER_00
 The next one?

0:09:57	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:09:58	SPEAKER_00
 So, I talk about the problem.

0:10:00	SPEAKER_00
 And then I look at the user manual, the 100 page is thick, so we don't want that.

0:10:05	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:10:06	SPEAKER_00
 So, I propose that easy to use prototype.

0:10:11	SPEAKER_00
 You can navigate on TV screen, and we can prove it to the user's preference.

0:10:15	SPEAKER_00
 And we need to have the TV connected to the internet.

0:10:18	SPEAKER_00
 So, in order to access the TV programs by XML, and we need some...

0:10:25	SPEAKER_00
 To do some pre-processing, from the technical aspect, the processing should be done on the TV set, then on the remote controller.

0:10:33	SPEAKER_00
 Right.

0:10:34	SPEAKER_00
 And then, the speech recognition is a...

0:10:38	SPEAKER_00
 Harry says we may just put in... we may KIV.

0:10:41	SPEAKER_01
 What do you mean by the pre-processing will be done on the TV?

0:10:45	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, all the processing is done.

0:10:47	SPEAKER_00
 The TV is a computer. It has some processing power there.

0:10:51	SPEAKER_01
 So, we should have specific TV or...

0:10:55	SPEAKER_02
 So, I use this...

0:10:56	SPEAKER_02
 A TV with the remote control.

0:10:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, because...

0:11:01	SPEAKER_00
 I use this one remote controller.

0:11:04	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, I think it is.

0:11:06	SPEAKER_02
 There is a technology like ShowView, who is already available on most of the TV set, on recorders or things like that, and we can try to get this information onto the remote control to do the processing on the remote controller.

0:11:23	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, that's right.

0:11:24	SPEAKER_00
 So, we do the processing on the remote controller.

0:11:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:11:27	SPEAKER_00
 So, can you be using any TV, any conventional TV sets?

0:11:30	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah.

0:11:31	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:11:32	SPEAKER_00
 Speech recognition?

0:11:34	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, that's all.

0:11:36	SPEAKER_00
 The next one.

0:11:37	SPEAKER_00
 So, I cover a simple design.

0:11:39	SPEAKER_00
 Just keep the navigation buttons.

0:11:41	SPEAKER_00
 That's a good idea.

0:11:43	SPEAKER_02
 I think we don't need really much buttons to... if we have a screen to navigate on TV.

0:11:50	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:11:51	SPEAKER_02
 So, well, four or five buttons.

0:11:55	SPEAKER_02
 It's sufficient.

0:11:57	SPEAKER_02
 It's easy to build.

0:11:59	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that does not consume much power.

0:12:03	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:12:04	SPEAKER_00
 That's all.

0:12:06	SPEAKER_03
 Oh, but you have a catch there.

0:12:08	SPEAKER_03
 Assume that if you want to go to... if you're watching channel two and if you want to go to channel 99, then...

0:12:16	SPEAKER_02
 Well, then you go to the main menu and you have a go to channel and then...

0:12:24	SPEAKER_00
 No, because you choose by channel and so...

0:12:27	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:12:28	SPEAKER_00
 You buy TV programs so you don't have 100 channels to choose from.

0:12:32	SPEAKER_02
 If you go by channel, you don't have to do that.

0:12:36	SPEAKER_02
 But I think he said if you want to make a big jump.

0:12:42	SPEAKER_02
 Oh, jump.

0:12:43	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's right.

0:12:45	SPEAKER_02
 Well, you have to have a device when you could...

0:12:50	SPEAKER_00
 A mouse or...

0:12:52	SPEAKER_02
 Not a mouse, but something that says more clearly that right.

0:12:57	SPEAKER_02
 Right, left, up, down.

0:13:00	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:13:01	SPEAKER_02
 To have the ability to write something to the navigator, maybe directly.

0:13:08	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:13:11	SPEAKER_02
 We can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that.

0:13:17	None
 Mm-hmm.

0:13:19	SPEAKER_01
 But how do you...

0:13:20	SPEAKER_01
 We can see the external... this remote.

0:13:24	SPEAKER_00
 It's gonna be small.

0:13:26	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, of course.

0:13:28	SPEAKER_01
 It's too small.

0:13:30	SPEAKER_01
 It's too small.

0:13:31	SPEAKER_00
 Under the sofa and we can't find it.

0:13:34	SPEAKER_00
 So, if you want to find it, you just...

0:13:37	SPEAKER_00
 You just... it just has to respond to you when you look for the device.

0:13:41	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, this one.

0:13:42	SPEAKER_00
 I don't know how.

0:13:45	SPEAKER_03
 We'll just give it an aim and we call him.

0:13:48	SPEAKER_00
 And you respond to you.

0:13:50	SPEAKER_00
 And there...

0:13:51	SPEAKER_01
 The other side.

0:13:53	SPEAKER_02
 Okay, so, next presentation.

0:13:57	SPEAKER_02
 What is it, print for?

0:14:00	SPEAKER_01
 So, hi.

0:14:03	SPEAKER_03
 Okay, after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface, I think most of the points which I want to already covered here.

0:14:20	SPEAKER_03
 And to find the most interesting features, what the users would be interested in, what we have done is we have put our feedback forms in all the magazines.

0:14:30	SPEAKER_03
 And the users sent the feedbacks.

0:14:34	SPEAKER_03
 And based on that, these are the findings which we got.

0:14:40	SPEAKER_03
 And adding up a speech interface is always good for a TV remote.

0:14:46	SPEAKER_03
 But the technology, we already know that.

0:14:50	SPEAKER_03
 What is it?

0:14:51	SPEAKER_02
 I think it will be a bit complicated to make a speech recognized.

0:14:58	SPEAKER_02
 It runs on the small...

0:15:01	SPEAKER_03
 It has to be seen how feasible it is.

0:15:04	SPEAKER_00
 But I think if you want to recognize numbers, it's a well-studied problem.

0:15:09	SPEAKER_00
 If you just recognize numbers, it's limited.

0:15:13	SPEAKER_03
 We can put a limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones.

0:15:17	SPEAKER_03
 We just have the...

0:15:19	SPEAKER_02
 And this can allow to choose the program, for instance, without adding buttons.

0:15:25	SPEAKER_02
 So, it's a good idea.

0:15:26	SPEAKER_03
 It's not going to take much space also.

0:15:29	SPEAKER_03
 It's going to be very slim.

0:15:31	SPEAKER_03
 And next one was the size of the remote control.

0:15:33	SPEAKER_03
 It has to be, of course, a very slim and small one.

0:15:37	SPEAKER_03
 And, of course, most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive.

0:15:43	SPEAKER_03
 So, this is an important criteria here.

0:15:45	SPEAKER_01
 But do you think what they suggested is possible to...

0:15:50	SPEAKER_01
 I mean, we have to look for the trade-off.

0:15:52	SPEAKER_03
 The futures and the cost.

0:15:54	SPEAKER_00
 I think that if we go for quality, people may tolerate it for high quality.

0:15:59	SPEAKER_00
 And, of course, it comes with a reasonable cost.

0:16:03	SPEAKER_00
 Maybe not less, but they may be willing to pay.

0:16:06	SPEAKER_00
 A little bit more.

0:16:07	SPEAKER_03
 A little bit more for...

0:16:08	SPEAKER_00
 With extra futures.

0:16:09	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, extra futures.

0:16:10	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, speech is an important extra future.

0:16:14	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, that's right.

0:16:15	SPEAKER_01
 But is it useful or not?

0:16:17	SPEAKER_01
 Well, there is a noisy thing.

0:16:19	SPEAKER_03
 I mean, for a lazy guys, they could just say nine.

0:16:22	SPEAKER_03
 And the nine channel comes.

0:16:24	SPEAKER_03
 Or just say a movie name.

0:16:26	SPEAKER_03
 I don't go for movie names, but only for the numbers on the channel, or volume up, volume down, brightness, contrast.

0:16:33	SPEAKER_03
 So, I think that should be a good idea to put these features.

0:16:38	SPEAKER_03
 And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages.

0:16:42	SPEAKER_02
 Well, we just have to find a mean how to write a microphone.

0:16:50	SPEAKER_02
 Well, there's a microphone into the remote control.

0:16:54	SPEAKER_02
 So...

0:16:55	SPEAKER_02
 I think it should be all right.

0:17:00	SPEAKER_01
 What is the teletext?

0:17:01	SPEAKER_01
 The next thing is that we can do that.

0:17:04	SPEAKER_01
 We can integrate small microphones in the remote.

0:17:07	SPEAKER_01
 So, it's not a really problem.

0:17:10	SPEAKER_02
 Okay.

0:17:11	SPEAKER_01
 What about lighting adaptive options?

0:17:14	SPEAKER_01
 Yeah, as this goes on the...

0:17:15	SPEAKER_01
...alurementing.

0:17:16	SPEAKER_01
 But require more traffic.

0:17:18	SPEAKER_03
 I think not much people are really interested in this point.

0:17:22	SPEAKER_03
 If it's not really...

0:17:23	SPEAKER_00
 It is interesting, but we are only concerned with the remote controller.

0:17:28	SPEAKER_00
 So, you need special TV sets to do that.

0:17:33	SPEAKER_00
 It's done via this remote controller.

0:17:37	SPEAKER_02
 It's very complex.

0:17:39	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, I think it's a bit complex too.

0:17:42	SPEAKER_03
 Yeah, it's for the industrial design and users, interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not.

0:17:52	SPEAKER_02
 For our next product, our new TV set with...

0:17:55	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, the automatic control...

0:17:58	SPEAKER_00
...sound adjustment.

0:17:59	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, but it's quite possible.

0:18:01	SPEAKER_00
 But maybe not in this project.

0:18:12	SPEAKER_01
 So, we have...

0:18:14	SPEAKER_01
 I think we have...

0:18:15	SPEAKER_01
...still we have...

0:18:17	SPEAKER_01
...capped off me.

0:18:26	SPEAKER_01
 So, anything to discuss?

0:18:31	SPEAKER_03
 I think as I discussed, that four points would be good for unmarketing.

0:18:36	SPEAKER_03
 The speech interface and the less reasonable...

0:18:41	SPEAKER_03
...cause and the lighting adaptation and the teletext.

0:18:46	SPEAKER_03
 And regarding the teletext, these are the text information which you go on the televisions.

0:18:54	SPEAKER_03
 If you're watching a foreign movie, you get a subtitle sometimes.

0:18:59	SPEAKER_03
 And if you're a French guy watching an English movie, you would like to have it in French.

0:19:04	SPEAKER_03
 And if I'm a German, then I would like to have my options in German.

0:19:08	SPEAKER_03
 So, the remote...

0:19:10	SPEAKER_03
 It should have some...

0:19:11	SPEAKER_03
 It should give me some flexibility of choosing the languages.

0:19:15	SPEAKER_03
 That's a really good point.

0:19:18	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but what about the new projects requirements?

0:19:24	SPEAKER_02
 I think we should give up with teletext.

0:19:29	SPEAKER_01
 I guess it's the popular.

0:19:34	SPEAKER_02
 Well, so maybe we can already think about a way to access the internet.

0:19:43	SPEAKER_02
 We had a television.

0:19:46	SPEAKER_00
 Using the TV to access the internet.

0:19:49	SPEAKER_00
 Are you thinking about the internet?

0:19:52	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, but we can think that in a few years there will be TV set that can access the internet.

0:19:57	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah, okay.

0:19:58	SPEAKER_02
 So, it's a good idea if we think about how to build up our remote control with this functionality.

0:20:12	SPEAKER_02
 Which would come in a few years.

0:20:16	SPEAKER_02
 So, if we already have it in our remote control...

0:20:19	SPEAKER_01
 So, you have to...

0:20:20	SPEAKER_01
...remod control...

0:20:21	SPEAKER_00
...the future.

0:20:22	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:23	SPEAKER_00
 The future demand, market demand.

0:20:24	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah, to design.

0:20:25	SPEAKER_02
 Well, not to implement it, but to find a way to add this functionality in a...

0:20:33	SPEAKER_00
 In the future?

0:20:34	SPEAKER_02
 Yeah.

0:20:35	SPEAKER_02
 In an easy manner, if it's possible.

0:20:38	SPEAKER_00
 Because all the TV sets will be digital, right? All the programs, everything will be in digital, then...

0:20:43	SPEAKER_00
...and a lot.

0:20:44	SPEAKER_00
 The system will change and...

0:20:46	SPEAKER_00
 Yeah.

0:20:47	SPEAKER_00
...we have to enter the bed for those changes.

0:20:49	None
 Yeah.

0:20:50	None
 Okay.

0:20:51	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:20:52	SPEAKER_01
 So...

0:20:53	SPEAKER_01
 So, let's go for the...

0:20:56	SPEAKER_01
...the Nenshiprik.

0:20:57	SPEAKER_01
 And...

0:20:59	SPEAKER_01
 Okay.

0:21:00	SPEAKER_01
 Thank you.

0:21:01	SPEAKER_00
 Okay.

0:21:02	SPEAKER_00

0:21:03	None
 Okay.

0:21:04	None
